The '''1992 Fujimori auto-coup''', also known as the '''1992 auto-coup''', was a [[constitutional crisis]] that occurred in [[Peru]] after [[President of Peru|President]] [[Alberto Fujimori]] dissolved the [[Congress of Peru]] as well as the judiciary of Peru and assumed full legislative and judicial powers.

==Background==
The systemic weakness of government institutions had worsened under the administration of Fujimori's predecessor, [[Alan García]], which turned away from the private sector while attempting to control the banking system, leading to the collapse of the entire structure of public administration.

During Fujimori's first term in office, the [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]] (APRA) and [[Democratic Front (Peru)|Democratic Front]] (FREDEMO) parties remained in control of both chambers of Congress (the [[Chamber of Deputies of Peru|Chamber of Deputies]] and [[Senate of Peru|Senate]]), thus hampering Fujimori's ability to get his sponsored legislation enacted.

When Fujimori was [[president-elect]] prior to his [[inauguration]] into office, he traveled to [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] in order to meet with top-level officials and request [[Foreign aid|aid]] for Peru. While in the U.S., Fujimori was told that Peru must adopt a "relatively orthodox economic strategy" and stabilize [[hyperinflation]] before being permitted re-entrance into the international financial community, meaning that these policies would have to be implemented prior to the granting of any international aid to Peru. The Congress, however, resisted Fujimori's efforts to adopt policies advocated by the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]], especially [[austerity]] measures.

In response, Fujimori mounted an [[auto-coup]] ({{lang-es|autogolpe}}, sometimes ''Fuji-coup'' or ''fujigolpe'') on Sunday April 5, 1992.

==Coup d'état==
On the night of Sunday April 5, 1992, Fujimori appeared on television and announced that he was "temporarily dissolving" the Congress of the Republic and "reorganizing" the Judicial Branch of the government. He then ordered the [[Peruvian Army]] to drive a tank to the steps of Congress to shut it down. When a group of senators attempted to hold session, [[tear gas]] was deployed against them.

That same night, the military was sent to detain prominent members of the political opposition. Fujimori is [[Alberto Fujimori's arrest and trial|currently on trial]] for the kidnapping of journalist [[Gustavo Gorriti]] and businessman Samuel Dyer, both of whom were detained by the military on the night of the coup.

One of the most criticized moves that Fujimori took was the attempt to arrest former President [[Alan García]], in order to have him face numerous trials. Also contributing to the coup was Fujimori's desire to remove García, who was serving as a Senator, as a political rival and potential future presidential candidate. However, García managed to escape arrest and sought political asylum in [[Colombia]].

==Results==
Fujimori issued [[Decree Law 25418]], which dissolved the Congress, gave the Executive Branch all legislative powers, suspended much of the [[Constitution of Peru|Constitution]], and gave the president the power to enact various reforms, such as the "application of drastic punishments" towards terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.congreso.gob.pe/ntley/Imagenes/Leyes/25418.pdf Decree Law 25418]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Fujimori called for elections of a new congress that was later named the [[Democratic Constitutional Congress]] (''Congreso Constituyente Democrático''); Fujimori received a majority in this new congress, which later drafted the [[Constitution of Peru|1993 Constitution]]. Fujimori also set about curtailing the [[independence of the judiciary]] and constitutional rights with a declaration of a [[state of emergency]] and [[curfew]]s, as well as enacting controversial "severe emergency laws" to deal with terrorism.

The [[Prime Minister of Peru|Prime Minister]], [[Alfonso de Los Heros]], and the [[Minister of Agriculture (Peru)|Minister of Agriculture]] resigned while the rest of ministers supported the ''de facto'' government. [[Máximo San Román]], then the First [[Vicepresident of Peru|Vice-president]] of the Republic, did not support the coup. He was not in the country at the time of the coup, and he was not informed about this move.

The  legislative branch responded by activating the constitutional clauses that allow the Congress to remove the president from office. Fujimori was removed and Máximo San Román was formally sworn into the presidency. Prominent politicians supported this move: former President [[Fernando Belaúnde Terry]] and most of the [[Popular Action (Peru)|Acción Popular]] Party supported San Román, while former FREDEMO presidential candidate [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] called for a civil insurgency to overthrow Fujimori. However, neither the military nor the big majority of the people ever supported San Román, and he never became the ''de facto'' president.

==Domestic reaction==
There was little initial domestic resistance to the auto-coup. An opinion poll carried out shortly thereafter indicated that Fujimori's decision to dissolve Congress and restructure the judicial system had an 85% approval rating. The economic and political situation was so poor at the time that for many Peruvians things could get only better. At the time, Fujimori's bold and risky economic reforms (the "Fujishock") appeared to be working.

Fujimori himself claimed that the auto-coup was necessary to break with the deeply entrenched interests that were hindering him from rescuing Peru from the chaotic state in which former president [[Alan García]] had left it, but critics say that he could never have implemented his drastic [[Liberalism|liberal]] economic reform under a democratic government.
Another group of Military officers led by General [[Jaime Salinas Sedó]] attempted to overthrow Fujimori on November 13.

==International reactions==
International reactions to the auto-coup were different: International financial organizations delayed planned or projected loans, and the United States government suspended all aid to Peru other than humanitarian assistance, as did [[Germany]] and [[Spain]]. [[Venezuela]] broke off diplomatic relations, and [[Argentina]] withdrew its ambassador. [[Chile]] joined Argentina in requesting that Peru be suspended from the [[Organization of American States]]. The coup appeared to threaten the economic recovery strategy of reinsertion, and complicated the process of clearing arrears with the [[International Monetary Fund]].

Even before the coup, relations with the United States had been strained because of Fujimori's reluctance to sign an accord that would increase U.S. and Peruvian military efforts in [[coca eradication|eradicating coca fields]]. Although Fujimori eventually signed the accord in May 1991, in order to get desperately needed aid, the disagreements did little to enhance bilateral relations. The Peruvians saw drugs as primarily a U.S. problem and the least of their concerns, given the economic crisis, [[Shining Path]] guerrillas, and an outbreak of [[cholera]], which further isolated Peru because of a resulting ban on food imports.

However, two weeks after the auto-coup, the [[George H.W. Bush|Bush]] administration changed their position and officially recognized Fujimori as the legitimate leader of Peru. The [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) and the U.S. agreed that Fujimori's coup may have been extreme, but they did not want to see Peru return to the deteriorating state that it had been in before. In fact, the coup came not long after the U.S. government and media had launched a media offensive against the [[Shining Path]] (''Sendero Luminoso'', or S.L.) rural guerrilla movement. On March 12, 1992, Undersecretary of State for Latin American Affairs [[Bernard Aronson]] told the [[Congress of the United States|US Congress]]: "The international community and respected human rights organizations must focus the spotlight of world attention on the threat which Sendero poses... Latin America has seen violence and terror, but none like Sendero's... ''and'' make no mistake, if Sendero were to take power, we would see... genocide." Given Washington's concerns, long-term repercussions of the auto-coup turned out to be modest.

==Punishment of those responsible==
On November 26, 2007, ten former government officials were sentenced by the [[Supreme Court of Peru]] for their role in the autogolpe. Fujimori's Minister of the Interior, [[Juan Briones Dávila]], was sentenced to ten years imprisonment. Former fujimorista congressmen [[Jaime Yoshiyama]], [[Carlos Boloña]], [[Absalón Vásquez]], [[Víctor Joy Way]], [[Óscar de la Puente Raygada]], [[Jaime Sobero]], [[Alfredo Ross Antezana]], [[Víctor Paredes Guerra]], and [[Augusto Antoniolli Vásquez]] were all also sentenced for various crimes such as rebellion and kidnapping.

The '''2015 Commonwealth Law Conference''' was held in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], in April 2015.  The scandal of the conference occurred early when [[Julian Assange]] was to address the Conference, and various [[law lords]] became aware and opted to not be part of the conference.

==Controversy==
[[The Guardian]] reported that, "Judges from Scotland, England and Wales and the UK supreme court had agreed to speak at or chair other sessions but withdrew – in some cases after arriving at the conference centre – when they found out about [[Assange]]'s appearance. Among those to boycott the conference were the most senior judge in Scotland, [[Brian Gill, Lord Gill|Lord Gill]], and two judges on the supreme court, [[Lord Neuberger]] and [[Lord Hodge]]. A spokesperson for the [[Judicial Office for Scotland]] said: "The conference programme was changed to include Mr Assange's participation at short notice and without consultation. Mr Assange is, as a matter of law, currently a [[fugitive from justice]], and it would therefore not be appropriate for judges to be addressed by him. "Under these circumstances, the [[Lord President of the Court of Session#Lord President|Lord President]], Lord Gill, and the other Scottish judicial officeholders in attendance have withdrawn from the conference." A spokesman for the [[UK Supreme Court]] added: "Lord Neuberger and Lord Hodge share the concerns expressed by Lord Gill and his fellow senior Scottish judges ... "As a result of this unfortunate development, they trust that delegates will understand their decision to withdraw from the conference. ..." A spokesman for [[judiciary of England]] and Wales said: "The [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] shares the concerns expressed by Lord Gill and Lord Neuberger ... He agreed with the position taken by both, and the judges of England and Wales also withdrew from the conference. ...""&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/apr/16/julian-assange-speech-prompts-judges-boycott-legal-conference Julian Assange speech prompts judges to boycott legal conference], Joshua Rozenberg, [[The Guardian]], 16 April 2015, accessed 20 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hakim Marnissi Case''' is an investigation into a [[France|French]] [[radical Islam|Islamist radical]], Hakim Marnissi, for an attempted attack on the [[naval base]] of [[Toulon]]. He was arrested 29 October 2015 after receiving a hood and combat knife with integrated [[brass knuckles]] via mail order. Marnissi was indicted on 2 November for [[criminal association]] with a [[terrorist group|terrorist enterprise]] and imprisoned.&lt;ref name="figaro"&gt;{{Cite web|author = Christophe Cornevin|title= Attentat déjoué à Toulon : le profil du commanditaire se précise|url = http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2015/11/10/01016-20151110ARTFIG00433-un-attentat-contre-des-militaires-dejoue-a-toulon.php|work = Le Figaro|archive-date= 10 November 2015|access-date = 11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2014, Marnissi came to the attention of the [[General Directorate for Internal Security|DGSI]] when he started posting [[Facebook]] messages of support to volunteer [[jihadi|fighters]] in the Syrian-Iraqi combat who were under the banner of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Daech]].  While monitoring Marnissi, the police intercepted several emails exchanged directly with French jihadists currently fighting in Syria.&lt;ref name="tf1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Gilles Bouleau|date=11 November 2015|title=Attentat déjoué à Toulon : ce que l’on sait du plan prévu par Hakim Marnissi|url=http://lci.tf1.fr/jt-20h/videos/2015/attentat-dejoue-a-toulon-ce-que-l-on-sait-du-plan-prevu-par-hakim-8682475.html|language=fr|newspaper=TF1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Greg|last2=Whitlock|first2=Craig|date=14 November 2015|title=Caught between internal and external terror threats, France struggles to cope|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/caught-between-internal-and-external-terror-threats-france-struggles-to-cope/2015/11/14/c5e9fab0-8b00-11e5-9a07-453018f9a0ec_story.html|newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being arrested, Marnissi told police that he initially wanted to fight in Syria, but since he was prohibited from leaving the country, he decided to "default" to an attack on French soil.  Marnissi confirmed that his intended targets were "one or more naval bases in Toulon", home to most of France's naval force.  "He was radicalized astonishingly quickly," [[Le Figaro]] quotes an informed [[source (journalism)|source]].  "After separating gradually from his family and inner circle, he found refuge in a silent attitude, then isolationism."&lt;ref name="figaro"/&gt;

'''Apostasy''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|p|ɒ|s|t|ə|s|i}}; {{lang-grc-gre|ἀποστασία}} ''apostasia'', "a [[defection]] or [[revolt]]") is the formal [[religious disaffiliation|disaffiliation]] from, or abandonment or renunciation of a [[religion]] by a person. It can also be defined within the broader context of embracing an opinion contrary to [[Religious beliefs|one's previous beliefs]].&lt;ref name="umich"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0002.748 |title=Mallet, Edme-François, and François-Vincent Toussaint. "Apostasy". The Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert Collaborative Translation Project. Translated by Rachel LaFortune. Ann Arbor: Michigan Publishing, University of Michigan Library, 2012. Web. 1 April 2015.  Trans. of "Apostasie", ''Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers'', vol. 1. Paris, 1751.|publisher=quod.lib.umich.edu|accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; One who undertakes apostasy is known as an '''apostate'''. Undertaking apostasy is called '''apostatizing''' (or '''apostasizing''' – also spelled '''apostacizing'''). The term ''apostasy'' is used by [[sociology|sociologists]] to mean renunciation ''and'' criticism of, or opposition to, a person's former religion, in a technical sense and without pejorative connotation.

The term is occasionally also used [[metaphor]]ically to refer to renunciation of a non-religious belief or cause, such as a political party, [[brain trust]], or a sports team.

Apostasy is generally not a self-definition: few former believers call themselves apostates because of the negative connotation of the term.

Many religious groups and some states punish apostates; this may be the official policy of the religious group or may simply be the voluntary action of its members. Such [[punishment]] may include [[shunning]], [[excommunication]], [[verbal abuse]], physical violence, or even [[Religion and capital punishment|execution]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060116103512/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C2-1470584_1%2C00.html Muslim apostates cast out and at risk from faith and family]'', ''The Times'', February 05, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of punishment by death for apostates can be seen under the [[Sharia|Sharia law]] found in certain Islamic countries.

==Sociological definitions==
The American sociologist [[Lewis A. Coser]] (following the German philosopher and sociologist [[Max Scheler]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}) defines an apostate as not just a person who experienced a dramatic change in conviction but "a man who, even in his new state of belief, is spiritually living not primarily in the content of that faith, in the pursuit of goals appropriate to it, but only in the struggle against the old faith and for the sake of its negation."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis A. Coser]] ''The Age of the Informer'' Dissent:1249–54, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bromley1998"&gt;{{cite book |editor-link=David G. Bromley |editor-last=Bromley |editor-first=David G. |title=[[The Politics of Religious Apostasy|The Politics of Religious Apostasy: The Role of Apostates in the Transformation of Religious Movements]] |location=CT |publisher=Praeger Publishers |year=1998 |isbn=0-275-95508-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American sociologist [[David G. Bromley]] defined the apostate role as follows and distinguished it from the [[defection|defector]] and [[whistleblower]] roles.&lt;ref name="bromley1998"/&gt;
*''Apostate role'': defined as one that occurs in a highly polarized situation in which an organization member undertakes a total change of loyalties by allying with one or more elements of an oppositional coalition without the consent or control of the organization. The narrative documents the quintessentially evil essence of the apostate's former organization chronicled through the apostate's personal experience of capture and ultimate escape/rescue.
*''Defector role'': an organizational participant negotiates exit primarily with organizational authorities, who grant permission for role relinquishment, control the exit process, and facilitate role transmission. The jointly constructed narrative assigns primary moral responsibility for role performance problems to the departing member and interprets organizational permission as commitment to extraordinary moral standards and preservation of public trust.
*''Whistle-blower role'': defined here as when an organization member forms an alliance with an external regulatory agency through personal testimony concerning specific, contested organizational practices that the external unit uses to sanction the organization. The narrative constructed jointly by the whistle blower and regulatory agency is depicts the whistle-blower as motivated by personal conscience, and the organization by defense of the public interest.

[[Stuart A. Wright]], an American sociologist and author, asserts that apostasy is a unique phenomenon and a distinct type of religious defection in which the apostate is a defector "who is aligned with an oppositional coalition in an effort to broaden the dispute, and embraces public claims-making activities to attack his or her former group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Stuart, A. |chapter=Exploring Factors that Shape the Apostate Role |editor-last=Bromley |editor-first=David G. |title=[[The Politics of Religious Apostasy]] |page=109 |publisher=Praeger Publishers |year=1998 |isbn=0-275-95508-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights==
{{See also|Religious conversion}}
The [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]], considers the recanting of a person's religion a [[human rights|human right]] legally protected by the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]:

== History ==
As early as the 3rd century AD, apostasy against the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian faith]] in the [[Sasanian Empire]] was criminalized. The high priest, Kidir, instigated [[pogroms]] against Jews, Christians, Buddhists, and others in effort to solidify the hold of the state religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Urubshurow |first=Victoria |title=Introducing World Religions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tBhrg3kYU-cC |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Roman Empire]] adopted Christianity as its state religion, apostasy became formally criminalized in the [[Theodosian Code]], followed by the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] (the Justinian Code).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Oropeza |first=B. J. |title=Paul and Apostasy: Eschatology, Perseverance, and Falling Away in the Corinthian Congregation |year=2000 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ajbJhXCZApcC |isbn=978-3161473074 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Justinian Code went on to form the basis of law in most of Western Europe during the Middle Ages and so apostasy was similarly persecuted to varying degrees in Europe throughout this period and into the early modern period. Eastern Europe similarly inherited many of its legal traditions regarding apostasy from the Romans, but not from the Justinian Code.{{Citation needed|reason=no citation|date=December 2016}}

With the rise of Islam came a relative religious tolerance in the Middle Eastern regions{{Citation needed|reason=no citation for statement|date=December 2016}}. Nevertheless, as the Middle Ages progressed, the successive Islamic caliphates began to enforce their own laws against apostasy, often modeled on those of the Romans and the Europeans.{{Citation needed|reason=no citation for statement|date=December 2016}}

==Atrocity stories==
The term "atrocity story" is controversial as it relates to the differing views amongst scholars about the credibility of the accounts of former members.

[[Bryan R. Wilson]], Reader Emeritus of Sociology of the University of Oxford says apostates of new religious movements are generally in need of self-justification, seeking to reconstruct their past and to excuse their former affiliations, while blaming those who were formerly their closest associates. Wilson, thus, challenges the reliability of the apostate's testimony by saying that the apostate "must always be seen as one whose personal history predisposes him to bias with respect to both his previous religious commitment and affiliations, the suspicion must arise that he acts from a personal motivation to vindicate himself and to regain his self-esteem, by showing himself to have been first a victim but subsequently to have become a redeemed crusader." Wilson also asserts that some apostates or defectors from religious organisations rehearse atrocity stories to explain how, by manipulation, coercion or deceit, they were recruited to groups that they now condemn.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Bryan R. ''Apostates and New Religious Movements'' (1994) [http://www.neuereligion.de/ENG/Wilson/ (Available online)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212124854/http://www.neuereligion.de/ENG/Wilson/ |date=December 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Duhaime]] of the [[Université de Montréal]] writes, referring to Wilson, based on his analysis of three books by apostates of new religious movements, that stories of apostates cannot be dismissed only because they are subjective.&lt;ref&gt;Duhaime, Jean ([[Université de Montréal]]) ''Les Témoigagnes de Convertis et d'ex-Adeptes'' (English: ''The testimonies of converts and former followers'', article that appeared in the otherwise English language book ''New Religions in a Postmodern World'' edited by [[Mikael Rothstein]] and [[Reender Kranenborg]] RENNER Studies in New religions [[Aarhus University]] press, {{ISBN|87-7288-748-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Danny Jorgensen]], Professor at the Department of Religious Studies of the [[University of Florida]], in  his book ''The Social Construction and Interpretation of Deviance: Jonestown and the Mass Media'' argues that the role of the [[mass media|media]] in constructing and reflecting reality is particularly apparent in its coverage of cults. He asserts that this complicity exists partly because apostates with an atrocity story to tell make themselves readily available to reporters and partly because new religious movements have learned to be suspicious of the media and, therefore, have not been open to investigative reporters writing stories on their movement from an insider's perspective. Besides this lack of information about the experiences of people within new religious movements, the media is attracted to [[sensationalism|sensational]] stories featuring accusations of food and sleep deprivation, sexual and physical abuse, and excesses of spiritual and emotional authority by the charismatic leader.&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, Danny. ''The Social Construction and Interpretation of Deviance: Jonestown and the Mass Media'' as cited in McCormick Maaga, Mary, ''Hearing the Voices of Jonestown'' 1st ed. (Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1998) pp.39, {{ISBN|0-8156-0515-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Langone]] argues that some will accept uncritically the positive reports of current members without calling such reports, for example, "benevolence tales" or "personal growth tales".  He asserts that only the critical reports of ex-members are called "tales", which he considers to be a term that clearly implies falsehood or fiction.  He states that it wasn't until 1996 that a researcher conducted a study&lt;ref name="Zab1996"/&gt; to assess the extent to which so called "atrocity tales" might be based on fact.&lt;ref name="Zab1996"&gt;Zablocki, Benjamin, ''Reliability and validity of apostate accounts in the study of religious communities''.

==Contemporary criminalization of apostasy==
{{further|Application of sharia law by country|Use of capital punishment by nation|Freedom of religion}}

Historically, apostasy was considered a criminal offense in many societies, commonly likened with the [[crime]]s of [[treason]], [[desertion]], or [[mutiny]]. For instance, European converts from Christianity to Islam who sought refuge in the [[Barbary States]] or in the [[Ottoman Empire]] were termed "renegades" in [[history of the Mediterranean|the history of that region]].

As of 2014, twenty-five countries criminalize public apostasy. As of 2014, no country in the [[Americas]] or [[Europe]] had any law forbidding the renunciation of religious belief.&lt;ref name="pew"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Theodorou |first1=Angelina E. |title=Which countries still outlaw apostasy and blasphemy? |url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/29/which-countries-still-outlaw-apostasy-and-blasphemy/ |website=PewResearch.org |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{Main|Apostasy in Christianity}}
{{See also|Apostata capiendo|Backslide}}
The Christian understanding of apostasy is "a willful falling away from, or rebellion against, Christian truth. Apostasy is the rejection of Christ by one who has been a Christian&amp;nbsp;...", though certain Protestants believe that biblically this is impossible ('[[Once saved, always saved|once saved, forever saved]]').&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Muller, ''Dictionary of Greek and Latin Theological Terms: Drawn Principally from Protestant Scholastic Theology'', 41. ''The Tyndale Bible Dictionary'' defines apostasy as a "Turning against God, as evidenced by abandonment and repudiation of former beliefs. The term generally refers to a deliberate renouncing of the faith by a once sincere believer&amp;nbsp;..." ("Apostasy," Walter A. Elwell and Philip W. Comfort, editors, 95).&lt;/ref&gt; "Apostasy is the antonym of conversion; it is deconversion."&lt;ref&gt;Paul W. Barnett, ''Dictionary of the Later New Testament and its Developments,'' "Apostasy," 73. Scott McKnight says, "Apostasy is a theological category describing those who have voluntarily and consciously abandoned their faith in the God of the covenant, who manifests himself most completely in Jesus Christ" (''Dictionary of Theological Interpretation of the Bible'', "Apostasy," 58).&lt;/ref&gt; B. J. Oropeza states that apostasy is a "phenomenon that occurs when a religious follower or group of followers turn away from or otherwise repudiate the central beliefs and practices they once embraced in a respective religious community."&lt;ref&gt;B. J. Oropeza, ''In the Footsteps of Judas and Other Defectors'' :Apostasy in the New Testament Communities, vol. 1 (Eugene: Cascade, 2011), p. 1; idem, ''Jews, Gentiles, and the Opponents of Paul'': Apostasy in the New Testament Communities, vol. 2 (2012), p. 1; idem, ''Churches under Siege of Persecution and Assimilation'': Apostasy in the New Testament Communities, vol.3 (2012), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Greek]] noun ἀποστασία ''apostasia'' ("rebellion, abandonment, state of apostasy, defection")&lt;ref&gt;Walter Bauder, "Fall, Fall Away," ''The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology'' (''NIDNTT''), 3:606.&lt;/ref&gt; is found only twice in the New Testament (Acts 21:21; 2 Thessalonians 2:3).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Fink, "Apostasy," in the ''Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary'', 87. In Acts 21:21, "Paul was falsely accused of teaching the Jews apostasy from Moses&amp;nbsp;... [and] he predicted the great apostasy from Christianity, foretold by Jesus (Matt. 24:10-12), which would precede 'the Day of the Lord' (2 Thess. 2:2f.)" (D. M. Pratt, ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'', "Apostasy," 1:192). Some pre-tribulation adherents in Protestantism believe that the apostasy mentioned in 2 Thess. 2:3 can be interpreted as the pre-tribulation [[Rapture]] of all Christians. This is because apostasy means departure (translated so in the first seven English translations) (Dr. Thomas Ice, ''Pre-Trib Perspective'', March 2004, Vol.8, No.11).&lt;/ref&gt; However, "the concept of apostasy is found throughout Scripture."&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'', 1:192.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Dictionary of Biblical Imagery'' states that "There are at least four distinct images in Scripture of the concept of apostasy. All connote an intentional defection from the faith."&lt;ref&gt;"Apostasy," 39.&lt;/ref&gt; These images are: Rebellion; Turning Away; Falling Away; Adultery.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Dictionary of Biblical Imagery'', 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Rebellion: "In classical literature apostasia was used to denote a coup or defection. By extension the Septuagint always uses it to portray a rebellion against God (Joshua 22:22; 2 Chronicles 29:19)."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*Turning away: "Apostasy is also pictured as the heart turning away from God (Jeremiah 17:5-6) and righteousness (Ezekiel 3:20). In the OT it centers on Israel's breaking [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] relationship with God through disobedience to the law (Jeremiah 2:19), especially following other gods (Judges 2:19) and practicing their immorality (Daniel 9:9-11)&amp;nbsp;... Following the Lord or journeying with him is one of the chief images of faithfulness in the Scriptures&amp;nbsp;... The&amp;nbsp;... Hebrew root (''swr'') is used to picture those who have turned away and ceased to follow God ('I am grieved that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me,' 1 Samuel 15:11)&amp;nbsp;... The image of turning away from the Lord, who is the rightful leader, and following behind false gods is the dominant image for apostasy in the OT."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*Falling away: "The image of falling, with the sense of going to eternal destruction, is particularly evident in the New Testament&amp;nbsp;... In his [Christ's] parable of the wise and foolish builder, in which the house built on sand falls with a crash in the midst of a storm (Matthew 7:24-27)&amp;nbsp;... he painted a highly memorable image of the dangers of falling spiritually."&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Biblical Imagery'', 39. Paul Barnett says, "Jesus foresaw the fact of apostasy and warned both those who would fall into sin as well as those who would cause others to fall (see, e.g., Mark 9:42-49)." (''Dictionary of the Later NT'', 73).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Adultery: One of the most common images for apostasy in the Old Testament is adultery.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; "Apostasy is symbolized as Israel the faithless spouse turning away from Yahweh her marriage partner to pursue the advances of other gods (Jeremiah 2:1-3; Ezekiel 16)&amp;nbsp;... 'Your children have forsaken me and sworn by god that are not gods. I supplied all their needs, yet they committed adultery and thronged to the houses of prostitutes' (Jeremiah 5:7, NIV). Adultery is used most often to describe the horror of the betrayal and covenant breaking involved in idolatry. Like literal adultery it does include the idea of someone blinded by infatuation, in this case for an idol: 'How I have been grieved by their adulterous hearts&amp;nbsp;... which have lusted after their idols' (Ezekiel 6:9)."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Speaking with specific regard to apostasy in [[Christianity]], Michael Fink writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Apostasy is certainly a biblical concept, but the implications of the teaching have been hotly debated.&lt;ref&gt;McKnight adds: "Because apostasy is disputed among Christian theologians, it must be recognized that ones overall hermeneutic and theology (including ones general philosophical orientation) shapes how one reads texts dealing with apostasy." ''Dictionary of Theological Interpretation of the Bible'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate has centered on the issue of apostasy and salvation. Based on the concept of God's sovereign grace, some hold that, though true believers may stray, they never totally fall away. Others affirm that any who fall away were never really saved. Though they may have "believed" for a while, they never experienced regeneration. Still others argue that the biblical warnings against apostasy are real and that believers maintain the freedom, at least potentially, to reject God's salvation.&lt;ref&gt;''Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary'', "Apostasy," 87.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the recent past, in the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] the word was also applied to the renunciation of [[Religious vows|monastic vows]] (''apostasis a monachatu''), and to the abandonment of the [[clergy|clerical profession]] for the life of the world (''apostasis a clericatu'') without necessarily amounting to a rejection of Christianity.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses beliefs#Apostasy}}
[[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness]] publications define ''apostasy'' as the abandonment of the worship and service of God, constituting rebellion against God.&lt;ref&gt;''Reasoning From the Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1989, p. 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt; They apply the term to a range of conduct, including open dissent with the religion's doctrines, celebration of "false religious holidays" (including Christmas and Easter), and participation in activities and worship of other religions.&lt;ref&gt;''Shepherd the Flock of God'', Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania,  2010, p. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the religion who are accused of apostasy are typically required to appear before a congregational judicial committee, by which they may be "disfellowshipped"—the most severe of the religion's disciplinary procedures that involves expulsion from the religion and shunning by all congregants, including immediate family members not living in the same home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holden |first=Andrew |title=Jehovah's Witnesses: Portrait of a Contemporary Religious Movement |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2002 |isbn=0-415-26610-6 |pages=32, 78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baptized individuals who leave the organization because they disagree with the religion's teachings are also regarded as apostates and are shunned.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Watchtower |pages=21–25 |date=January 15, 2006|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2006046#h=17|title=Do Not Allow Place for the Devil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watch Tower Society literature describes apostates as "mentally diseased" individuals who can "infect others with their disloyal teachings".&lt;ref&gt;Journal for the Study of the Old Testament 28:5 [2004], p.&amp;nbsp;42–43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Jerome |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/war-of-words-breaks-out-among-jehovahs-witnesses-2361448.html |title=War of words breaks out among Jehovah's Witnesses |date=26 September 2011 |work=The Independent |accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former members who are defined as apostates are said to have become part of the [[antichrist]] and are regarded as more reprehensible than non-Witnesses.&lt;ref name=wtantich&gt;Questions From Readers, ''The Watchtower'', July 15, 1985, page 31, "Such ones willfully abandoning the Christian congregation thereby become part of the ‘antichrist.’ A person who had willfully and formally disassociated himself from the congregation would have matched that description. By deliberately repudiating God’s congregation and by renouncing the Christian way, he would have made himself an apostate. A loyal Christian would not have wanted to fellowship with an apostate ... Scripturally, a person who repudiated God’s congregation became more reprehensible than those in the world."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mormonism ====
{{Main|Ex-Mormon}}
Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (commonly called the [[Mormons]]) are considered by church leadership to engage in apostasy when they publicly teach or espouse opinions and doctrines contrary to the teachings of the church. Apostasy is also assumed in cases of a member engaging in activities forbidden by the church's teachings, such as adultery or homosexual relations. In such circumstances the church will frequently subject the non-conforming member to a [[disciplinary council]] which may result in disfellowshipment (a temporary loss of church participation privileges) or excommunication (a semi-permanent loss of church membership). The nature of the disciplinary council varies with the member's standing within the church as men's cases are often heard by a much larger group than women's.

===Hinduism===
Hinduism grants absolute freedom for an individual to leave or choose his or her faith on the Path to God. Hindus believe all sincere faiths ultimately lead to the same God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=From the Editors of Hinduism Today |title=What Is Hinduism?: Modern Adventures Into a Profound Global Faith |year=2007 |publisher=Himalayan Academy Publications |isbn=978-1-934145-00-5 |pages=416 pages.(see pages XX and 136)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
There is no concept of heresy or apostasy in [[Buddhism]], and people are free to leave Buddhism and renounce their beliefs in Buddhism without any consequence.&lt;ref&gt;Bhante Shravasti Dhammika, [http://www.buddhisma2z.com/content.php?id=24 Guide to Buddhism A-Z], accessed 23 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Azhar issued the same sentence for his children once they reach the age of puberty, in this September 1978 ruling.]]

In Islamic literature, apostasy is called ''irtidād'' or ''ridda''; an apostate is called ''murtadd'', which literally means 'one who turns back' from [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Heffening, W. (2012), "Murtadd." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs; Brill&lt;/ref&gt; Someone born to a Muslim parent, or who has previously converted to Islam, becomes a ''murtadd'' if he or she verbally denies any principle of belief prescribed by [[Quran]] or a [[Hadith]], deviates from approved Islamic belief (''ilhad''), or if he or she commits an action such as treating a copy of the Qurʾan with disrespect.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, W.

There are multiple verses in Quran that condemn apostasy,&lt;ref&gt;See chapters 3, 9 and 16 of Quran; e.g. {{quran-usc|3|90}} * {{quran-usc|9|66}} * {{quran-usc|16|88}}&lt;/ref&gt; but none which prescribe any punishments for apostasy and multiple [[Hadith]]s include statements that support the death penalty for apostasy.&lt;ref&gt;See Sahih al-Bukhari, {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|4|52|260}} * {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|9|83|17}} * {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|9|89|271}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of modern [[Ulama]] have come to the conclusion that despite the Quran suggesting that an apostate cannot be punished for apostasy,&lt;ref&gt;See Chapters 88, 4, 16, 50, 42, 24, 18 and 13 of Quran; e.g. {{quran-usc|88|21}}*{{quran-usc|4|137}}*{{quran-usc|16|106}}*{{quran-usc|50|45}}*{{quran-usc|42|6}}*{{quran-usc|42|48}}*{{quran-usc|24|54}}*{{quran-usc|18|29}}*{{quran-usc|16|82}}*{{quran-usc|13|40}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the select Hadith which do support the death for apostasy override the Quranic verses which suggest otherwise.

The concept and punishment of Apostasy has been extensively covered in Islamic literature since the 7th century.&lt;ref name=saeed2004&gt;Saeed, A., &amp; Saeed, H. (Eds.). (2004). Freedom of religion, apostasy and Islam. Ashgate Publishing; {{ISBN|0-7546-3083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person is considered apostate if he or she converts from Islam to another religion.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Marshall and Nina Shea (2011), SILENCED: HOW APOSTASY AND BLASPHEMY CODES ARE CHOKING FREEDOM WORLDWIDE, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-981228-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person is an apostate even if he or she believes in most of Islam, but verbally or in writing denies of one or more principles or precepts of Islam. Similarly, a Muslim who doubts the existence of Allah, makes offerings to and worships an idol or stupa or any image of God, confesses a belief in rebirth or incarnation of God, disrespects Quran or Islam's Prophets are all individually sufficient evidence of apostasy.&lt;ref&gt;Campo, Juan Eduardo (2009), Encyclopedia of Islam, Infobase Publishing, {{ISBN|978-1-4381-2696-8}}; see page 48, 108-109, 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peters, R., &amp; De Vries, G.

Many Muslims consider the Islamic law on apostasy and the punishment one of the immutable laws under Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Arzt, Donna (1995). Heroes or heretics: Religious dissidents under Islamic law, Wis. Int'l Law Journal, 14, 349-445&lt;/ref&gt; It is a ''[[hudud]]'' crime,&lt;ref&gt;Mansour, A. A. (1982).

According to some scholars, if a Muslim consciously and without coercion declares their rejection of Islam and does not change their mind after the time allocated by a judge for research, then the penalty for male apostates is death, and for females life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Warraq (2003), Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out, {{ISBN|978-1591020684}}, pp 1-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, I. (1995), Imprisonment in Pre-classical and Classical Islamic Law, ''Islamic Law and Society'', 2(2): 157-173&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Ahmadiyya]] Muslim sect, there is no punishment for apostasy, neither in the Quran nor as taught by [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="truthbook"&gt;{{Cite book| url=https://www.alislam.org/library/books/Apostasy-in-Islam.pdf | title=The Truth about the Alleged Punishment for Apostasy in Islam| publisher=Islam International Publications |isbn=1-85372-850-0|accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position of the Ahmadiyya Muslim sect is not widely accepted by clerics in other sects of Islam, and the Ahmadiyya sect of Islam acknowledges that major sects have a different interpretation and definition of apostasy in Islam.&lt;ref name="truthbook"/&gt;{{rp|18–25}} Ulama of major sects of Islam consider the Ahmadi Muslim sect as ''[[kafir]]s'' (infidels)&lt;ref name="truthbook"/&gt;{{rp|8}} and apostates.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, A.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Apostasy in Judaism}}
{{See also|Off the derech}}
[[File:141.Mattathias and the Apostate.jpg|thumb|[[Mattathias]] killing a Jewish apostate]]
The term apostasy is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] ἀποστασία from ἀποστάτης, meaning "political rebel," as applied to rebellion against God, its law and the faith of [[Israelites|Israel]] (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] מרד) in the Hebrew Bible. Other expressions for apostate as used by rabbinical scholars are ''mumar'' (מומר, literally "the one that is changed") and ''poshea yisrael'' (פושע ישראל, literally, "transgressor of Israel"), or simply ''kofer'' (כופר, literally "denier" and heretic).

The [[Torah]] states:
{{quote|If your brother, the son of your mother, your son or your daughter, the wife of your bosom, or your friend who is as your own soul, secretly entices you, saying, 'Let us go and serve other gods,' which you have not known, neither you nor your fathers, of the gods of the people which are all around you, near to you or far off from you, from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth, you shall not consent to him or listen to him, nor shall your eye pity him, nor shall you spare him or conceal him; but you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. And you shall stone him with stones until he dies, because he sought to entice you away from the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|13:6-10|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] [[Solomon|King Solomon]] is warned in a dream which "darkly portray[s] the ruin that would be caused by departure from God":&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Maclaren|Alexander MacLaren]], [http://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/1_kings/9.htm MacLaren's Expositions of Holy Scripture on 1 Kings 9], accessed 7 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|If you or your sons at all turn from following Me, and do not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them, then I will cut off Israel from the land which I have given them; and this house which I have consecrated for My name I will cast out of My sight. Israel will be a proverb and a byword among all peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|9:6-7|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The prophetic writings of [[Isaiah]] and [[Jeremiah]] provide many examples of defections of faith found among the Israelites (e.g., Isaiah 1:2–4 or Jeremiah 2:19), as do the writings of the prophet [[Ezekiel]] (e.g., Ezekiel 16 or 18). Israelite kings were often guilty of apostasy, examples including Ahab (I Kings 16:30–33), Ahaziah (I Kings 22:51–53), Jehoram (2 Chronicles 21:6,10), Ahaz (2 Chronicles 28:1–4), or Amon (2 Chronicles 33:21–23) among others. Amon's father Manasseh was also apostate for many years of his long reign, although towards the end of his life he renounced his apostasy (cf. 2 Chronicles 33:1–19).

In the [[Talmud]], [[Elisha ben Abuyah]] is singled out as an apostate and ''[[Epikoros]]'' (Epicurean) by the [[Pharisees]].

During the [[Spanish Inquisition]], a systematic conversion of Jews to Christianity took place to avoid expulsion from the [[Kingdom of Castile|kingdoms of Castille]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] as had been the case previously elsewhere in [[History of the Jews in Europe|medieval Europe]]. Although the vast majority of ''[[converso]]s'' simply assimilated into the Catholic dominant culture, a minority continued to practice Judaism in secret, gradually migrated throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Ottoman Empire, mainly to areas where Sephardic communities were already present as a result of the [[Alhambra Decree]]. Tens of thousands of Jews were baptised in the three months before the deadline for expulsion, some 40,000 if one accepts the totals given by Kamen, most of these undoubtedly to avoid expulsion,&lt;ref&gt;[[Spanish Inquisition#CITEREFKamen1998|Kamen (1998)]], pp. 29–31&lt;/ref&gt; rather than as a sincere change of faith. These ''conversos'' were the principal concern of the Inquisition; being suspected of continuing to practice Judaism put them at risk of denunciation and trial.

Several notorious Inquisitors, such as [[Tomás de Torquemada]], and Don Francisco the archbishop of [[Coria, Cáceres|Coria]], were descendants of apostate Jews. Other apostates who made their mark in history by attempting the conversion of other Jews in the 14th century include [[Juan de Valladolid]] and [[Astruc Remoch]].

[[Abraham Isaac Kook]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vbm-torah.org/archive/rk16-kook.htm template.htm Introduction to the Thought of Rav Kookby, Lecture #16: "Kefira" in our Day] from vbm-torah.org (the Virtual Beit Midrash)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vbm-torah.org/archive/rk17-kook.htm template.htm Introduction to the Thought of Rav Kookby, Lecture #17: Heresy V] from vbm-torah.org (the Virtual Beit Midrash)&lt;/ref&gt; first Chief Rabbi of the Jewish community in then Palestine, held that atheists were not actually denying God: rather, they were denying one of man's many images of God. Since any man-made image of God can be considered an idol, Kook held that, in practice, one could consider atheists as helping true religion burn away false images of god, thus in the end serving the purpose of true monotheism.

In practice, Judaism does not follow the Torah's prescription on this point: there is no punishment today for leaving Judaism, other than being excluded from participating in the rituals of the Jewish community - including leading worship, Jewish marriage or divorce, being called to the Torah and being buried in a Jewish cemetery.

===Other religious movements===
Controversies over [[new religious movement]]s (NRMs) have often involved apostates, some of whom join organizations or web sites opposed to their former religions. A number of scholars have debated the reliability of apostates and their stories, often called "apostate narratives".

The role of former members, or "apostates", has been widely studied by social scientists. At times, these individuals become outspoken public critics of the groups they leave. Their motivations, the roles they play in the [[anti-cult movement]], the validity of their testimony, and the kinds of narratives they construct, are controversial. Some scholars like [[David G. Bromley]], [[Anson Shupe]], and [[Brian R. Wilson]] have challenged the validity of the testimonies presented by critical former members. Wilson discusses the use of the [[atrocity story]] that is rehearsed by the apostate to explain how, by manipulation, [[coercion]], or [[Deception|deceit]], he was recruited to a group that he now condemns.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Bryan R. ''Apostates and New Religious Movements'', Oxford, England, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Stuart A. Wright]] explores the distinction between the apostate narrative and the role of the apostate, asserting that the former follows a predictable pattern, in which the apostate uses a "[[captivity narrative]]" that emphasizes manipulation, entrapment and being victims of "sinister cult practices". These narratives provide a rationale for a "hostage-rescue" motif, in which cults are likened to POW camps and [[deprogramming]] as heroic hostage rescue efforts. He also makes a distinction between "leavetakers" and "apostates", asserting that despite the popular literature and lurid media accounts of stories of "rescued or recovering 'ex-cultists'", empirical studies of defectors from NRMs "generally indicate favorable, sympathetic or at the very least mixed responses toward their former group".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Stuart, A. |chapter=Exploring Factors that Shape the Apostate Role |editor-last=Bromley |editor-first=David G. |title=[[The Politics of Religious Apostasy]] |pages=95–114 |publisher=Praeger Publishers |year=1998 |isbn=0-275-95508-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have attempted to classify apostates of NRMs. [[James T. Richardson]] proposes a theory related to a logical relationship between apostates and [[whistleblower]]s, using Bromley's definitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last=Richardson |first=James T.|chapter=Apostates, Whistleblowers, Law, and Social Control |editor-last=Bromley |editor-first=David G. |title=in The politics of religious apostasy: the role of apostates in the transformation of religious movements |isbn=0-275-95508-7  |publisher=Praeger |location=New York |year=1998 |page=171 |quote=Some of those who leave, whatever the method, become "apostates" and even develop into "whistleblowers", as those terms are defined in the first chapter of this volume. }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the former predates the latter. A person becomes an apostate and then seeks the role of whistleblower, which is then rewarded for playing that role by groups that are in conflict with the original group of membership such as anti-cult organizations. These organizations further cultivate the apostate, seeking to turn him or her into a whistleblower. He also describes how in this context, apostates' accusations of "brainwashing" are designed to attract perceptions of threats against the well being of young adults on the part of their families to further establish their newfound role as whistleblowers.&lt;ref name="isbn0-275-95508-7"&gt;{{cite book |last=Richardson |first=James T.|chapter=Apostates, Whistleblowers, Law, and Social Control  |editor-last=Bromley |editor-first=David G.|title=in The politics of religious apostasy: the role of apostates in the transformation of religious movements  |location=New York |publisher=Praeger |year=1998 |pages=185–186 |isbn=0-275-95508-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Armand L. Mauss]], defines true apostates as those exiters that have access to oppositional organizations that sponsor their careers as such, and validate the retrospective accounts of their past and their outrageous experiences in new religions—making a distinction between these and whistleblowers or defectors in this context.&lt;ref name="isbn0-275-95508-7-B"&gt;{{cite book |last=Richardson |first=James T. |chapter=Apostasy and the Management of Spoiled Identity |editor-last=Bromley |editor-first=David G. |title=in The politics of religious apostasy: the role of apostates in the transformation of religious movements  |publisher=Praeger |location=New York |year=1998 |pages=185–186 |isbn=0-275-95508-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Richter, a current member of the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (FLDS) writes that this can explain the writings of [[Carolyn Jessop]] and [[Flora Jessop]], former members of the FLDS church who consistently sided with authorities when children of the [[YFZ ranch]] were removed over charges of child abuse.&lt;!--

--&gt;

[[Massimo Introvigne]] in his ''Defectors, Ordinary Leavetakers and Apostates''&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne 1997&lt;/ref&gt; defines three types of [[narrative]]s constructed by apostates of new religious movements:

*Type I narratives characterize the exit process as defection, in which the organization and the former member negotiate an exiting process aimed at minimizing the damage for both parties.
*Type II narratives involve a minimal degree of negotiation between the exiting member, the organization they intend to leave, and the environment or society at large, implying that the ordinary apostate holds no strong feelings concerning his past experience in the group. They may make "comments on the organization's more negative features or shortcomings" while also recognizing that there was "something positive in the experience."
*Type III narratives are characterized by the ex-member dramatically reversing their loyalties and becoming a [[professional]] enemy of the organization they have left. These apostates often join an oppositional coalition fighting the organization, often claiming victimization.
Introvigne argues that apostates professing ''Type II'' narratives prevail among exiting members of controversial groups or organizations, while apostates that profess ''Type III'' narratives are a vociferous minority.

Ronald Burks, a psychology assistant at the [[Wellspring Retreat and Resource Center]], in a study comparing Group Psychological Abuse Scale (GPA) and Neurological Impairment Scale (NIS) scores in 132 former members of cults and cultic relationships, found a positive correlation between intensity of reform environment as measured by the GPA and cognitive impairment as measured by the NIS. Additional findings were a reduced earning potential in view of the education level that corroborates earlier studies of cult critics  (Martin 1993; Singer &amp; Ofshe, 1990; West &amp; Martin, 1994) and significant levels of depression and dissociation agreeing with Conway &amp; Siegelman, (1982), Lewis &amp; Bromley, (1987) and Martin, et al. (1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~rb267689/#_Toc2952976 |last=Burks |first=Ronald |title=Cognitive Impairment in Thought Reform Environments |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514131432/http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~rb267689/ |archivedate=May 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologists Bromley and Hadden note a lack of empirical support for claimed consequences of having been a member of a "cult" or "sect", and substantial empirical evidence against it. These include the fact that the overwhelming proportion of people who get involved in NRMs leave, most short of two years; the overwhelming proportion of people who leave do so of their own volition; and that two-thirds (67%) felt "wiser for the experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Hadden |editor-first=J |editor2-last=Bromley |editor2-first=D |year=1993 |title=The Handbook of Cults and Sects in America |location=Greenwich, CT |publisher=JAI Press, Inc |pages=75–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to F. Derks and psychologist of religion [[Jan van der Lans]], there is no uniform [[Emotional trauma|post-cult trauma]]. While psychological and social problems upon resignation are not uncommon, their character and intensity are greatly dependent on the personal history and on the traits of the ex-member, and on the reasons for and way of resignation.&lt;ref&gt;F. Derks and the professor of [[psychology of religion]] [[Jan van der Lans]] ''The post-cult syndrome: Fact or Fiction?'', paper presented at conference of Psychologists of Religion, [[Radboud University Nijmegen|Catholic University Nijmegen]], 1981, also appeared in Dutch language as ''Post-cult-syndroom; feit of fictie?'', published in the magazine ''Religieuze bewegingen in Nederland/Religious movements in the Netherlands'' nr. 6 pages 58–75 published by the [[Vrije Universiteit|Free university Amsterdam]] (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

The report of the "Swedish Government's Commission on New Religious Movements" (1998) states that the great majority of members of new religious movements derive positive experiences from their subscription to ideas or [[doctrine]]s that correspond to their personal needs—and that withdrawal from these movements is usually quite undramatic, as these people leave feeling enriched by a predominantly positive experience. Although the report describes that there are a small number of withdrawals that require support (100 out of 50,000+ people), the report did not recommend that any special resources be established for their rehabilitation, as these cases are very rare.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Swedish Government's Commission on New Religious Movements (1998)'', 1.6 The need for support  [http://www.regeringen.se/info_rosenbad/departement/social/sou98_113/s98_113.pdf (Swedish)]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [http://www.cesnur.org/testi/swedish.htm English translation] &lt;br /&gt;The great majority of members of the new religious movements derive positive experience from their membership. They have subscribed to an idea or doctrine that corresponds to their personal needs. Membership is of limited duration in most cases. After two years, the majority have left the movement. This withdrawal is usually quite undramatic, and the people withdrawing feel enriched by a predominantly positive experience. The Commission does not recommend that special resources be established for the rehabilitation of withdraws. The cases are too few in number and the problem picture too manifold for this: each individual can be expected to need help from several different care providers or facilitators.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Historical persons===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
*[[Julian the Apostate]] (331/332{{snd}}363 CE), the [[Roman emperor]], given a Christian education by those who assassinated his family, rejected his upbringing and declared his belief in [[Neoplatonism]] once it was safe to do so.
*[[Sir Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]] was declared 'The Great Apostate' by Parliament in 1628 for changing his political support from Parliament to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], thus shifting his religious support from [[Calvinism]] to [[Arminianism]].
*[[Abraham ben Abraham]], ([[Count]] Valentine (Valentin, Walentyn) Potocki), a [[Szlachta|Polish nobleman]] of the [[Potocki]] family who is claimed to have [[Conversion to Judaism|converted to Judaism]] and was [[Execution by burning|burned at the stake]] in 1749 because he had renounced [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and had become an [[613 mitzvot|observant]] [[Jew]].
*[[Maria Monk]] (1816–1849), sometimes considered an apostate of the [[Roman Catholic church|Catholic Church]], though there is little evidence that she ever was a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]].
*[[Lord George Gordon]], initially a zealous Protestant and instigator of the [[Gordon riots]] of 1780, finally renounced Christianity and converted to [[Judaism]], for which he was ostracized.
*[[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546), the founder of [[Lutheranism]], was considered both an apostate and [[Heresy|heretic]] by the strict definition of apostasy according to the [[Catholic Church]]. Most [[Protestantism|Protestants]] would naturally disagree, calling him a liberator and [[revolutionary]].

[[File:Bell_Edison_Telephone_Building.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[17 &amp; 19 Newhall Street, Birmingham|Bell Edison Telephone Building]] in [[Birmingham]] is a late 19th century red brick and architectural terracotta building]]
'''Architectural terracotta''' refers to a fired mixture of clay and water that can be used in a non-structural, semi-structural, or structural capacity on the exterior or interior of a building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Standard Definitions of Terms Relating to Structural Clay Products|journal=ASTM|volume=Designation C43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terracotta is an ancient building material that translates from Latin as "[[wikt:terracotta|baked earth]]". It can be unglazed, painted, slip glazed, or [[Glazed architectural terra-cotta|glazed]]. A piece of terracotta is composed of a hollow clay web enclosing a void space or cell. The cell can be installed in compression with [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] or hung with metal anchors. All cells are partially backfilled with mortar.

== Chemistry ==
Terracotta is made of a clay or silt matrix, a fluxing agent, and grog or bits of previously fired clay. Clays are the remnants of weathered rocks that are smaller than 2 microns. They are composted of silica and alumina. Kaolinite, halloysite, montmorillonite, illite and mica are all good types of clays for ceramic production. When mixed with water they create hydrous aluminum silica that is plastic and moldable. During the firing process the clays lose their water and become a hardened ceramic body.

Fluxes add oxygen when they burn to create more uniform melting of the silica particles throughout the body of the ceramic. This increases the strength of the material. Common fluxing materials are calcium carbonate, alkaline feldspars, manganese, and iron oxides.

Terracotta was made by the [[ancient Greeks]], [[Babylonians]], [[ancient Egyptians]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[History of China#Ancient China|Chinese]], and the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus River Valley]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures. It was used for roof tiles, medallions, statues, capitals and other small architectural details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Mary|last2=Bradshaw|first2=H.C.|title=Architectural Terra-Cottas from Two Temples at Falerii Veteres|journal=Papers of the British School at Rome|date=1916|volume=8| issue =  1|pages=1–34|doi=10.1017/s0068246200005407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese, Korean, and Japanese terracotta making traditions were focused on non-architectural uses such as statuary or cookware but various forms of terracotta tiles were popular roofing materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the Older Forms of Terra-Cotta Roofing Tiles|journal=The American Architect and Building News|date=March 26, 1892|volume=35| issue = 848|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western terracotta ===

==== Antiquity–1700s ====
Greeks used terracotta for capitals, friezes, and other elements of their temples like at Olympia or Selenius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geer|first1=Walter|title=Terr-Cotta in Architecture|date=1891|publisher=Gazley|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestically they used it for statuary and roof tiles. The Etruscans used terracotta for roof tiles, encased beams, and enclosed brick walls with it. The Roman terracotta innovation was the underfloor or [[hypocaust]] heating system that they used for their bath houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koçyiğit|first1=Oğuz|title=Terracotta Spacers from the Bathhouse at Amorium|journal=Anatolian Studies|date=2006|volume=56|pages=113–125|doi=10.1017/s006615460000079x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval European architecture did not expand terracotta use beyond the ancients. The manufacture of tile roofs diminished with low cost thatch roofing widely available.&lt;ref name="Terracotta"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliott|first1=Cecil D.|title=Terracotta|date=1992|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=52–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brandenburg|Southern German]], [[Luca della Robbia|Italian]] and [[Majorca|Spanish]] city states kept the tradition alive.

==== 1700s–1880s ====

;England
Englishmen Richard Holt and Thomas Ripley patented an artificial stone recipe in 1722. The business was fairly successful at making small architectural ornaments. Their company was taken over by George and Eleanor Coade in 1769.&lt;ref name="Terracotta"/&gt; George passed away a year later, leaving the company to his wife and daughter, both named Eleanor Coade. The Coade ladies popularized the grey mix of terracotta as an alternative to stone with the help of architects like Horace Walpole and Sir John Soane. Georgian architectural style was in vogue and demand for repetitive, classically inspired décor was very fashionable. The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (1867–1880) and the [[Natural History Museum of London]] (1879–1880) buildings ushered in an era of mass-produced architectural terracotta.

;United States
Most early terracotta was shipped from Europe or made by small local ceramicists. The first manufacturer of architectural terracotta was opened by Henry Tolman Jr. in Worcester, MA around 1849. The capitals in the Massachusetts State Capitol in Worcester are early examples of locally produced terracotta. In the 1850s, New York architects like Richard Upjohn and James Renwick began to use it as an economical replacement for stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shockley|first1=Jay|last2=Tunick|first2=Susan|title=A Capital Idea: Philadelphia and the Promotion of 1850s American Terra Cotta|journal=APT Bulletin|date=2012|volume=43| issue = 2/3|pages=31–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Architect and engineer (1920) (14760399636).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Railway Exchange Building (Chicago)|Railway Exchange Building]] in [[Chicago]] is faced entirely with light cream enamel terracotta (drawing by [[Hugh Ferriss]], 1920)]]

==== 1880s–1930s ====
Reactions to the Chicago fire in 1871 spurred interest in terracotta as a fireproof building material. In the age of skyscraper construction, the cast iron frame needed to be protected. Terracotta was a lightweight, moldable, fire and pollution resistant material that could be mass-produced. Architects such as [[Burnham and Root]], [[Henry Hobson Richardson|H.H. Richardson]], [[Louis Sullivan]], and [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]] became interested in using terracotta as a building material rather than just as imitation stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=James|title=History of Terra Cotta in New York City|journal=Architectural Record|date=1891-1892|volume=1|pages=136–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues with installation, water penetration, and corroding interior metal caused the industry to organize the National Terracotta Society. They published two widely used standards, in 1914 and 1924, that detailed construction methods, anchoring systems, waterproofing, and maintenance standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fus|first1=Michael|title=Architectural terra cotta: standards, specifications, and testing|date=1997|publisher=School of the Art Institute of Chicago|location=Chicago, IL|page=PhD. Dissertation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1930s–present ====
Economic interest in terracotta plummeted in the 1930s but the industry did not die out. Terracotta could not compete with newer massed produced materials such as plate glass, new metal alloys, and cement block construction. Changing fashions towards more minimalist, modern styles such as the Bauhaus School and International Style did not help the waning industry.

Post-World War II the industry had to face the decline of buildings built during the heyday of the material, 1910–1940. Structural problems resulting from incomplete waterproofing, improper installation, poor maintenance, and interior corroding mild steel made the material unpopular in newer constructions.

To combat this accusation against quality, several other industry publications were produced between 1945 and the 1960s. They did not succeed in reviving the artistic architectural terracotta but they were able to turn their attention to public buildings. Advances in machine extruded terracotta made it competitive with other hollow clay tile alternatives at the time. In tiles form, terracotta had a renewal as a hallmark of mid-century public buildings.

It lost steam in the 1960s with the introduction of more synthetic materials on the mass market. The industry was sustained by the need for replacement blocks for old buildings, hollow clay tile, and now rainscreen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tunich|first1=Susan|title=The Reign of Terra Cotta in the United States: Enduring in an Inhospitable Environment, 1930–1968|journal=APT Bulletin|date=1998|volume=29| issue = 1|pages=43–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacturing process ==

Terracotta can be made by pouring or pressing the mix into a plaster or sandstone mold, clay can be hand carved, or mix can be extruded into a mold using specialized machines. Clay shrinks as it dries from water loss therefore all molds are made slightly larger than the required dimensions. After the desired green-ware, or air dried, shape is created it is fired in a kiln for several days where it shrinks even further. The hot clay is slowly cooled then hand finished. The ceramics are shipped to the project site where they are installed by local contractors. The hollow pieces are partially backfilled with mortar then placed into the wall, suspended from metal anchors, or hung on metal shelf angles.&lt;ref name="Architectural Terra Cotta"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerns|first1=Edward|last2=Will|first2=Rachel|title=Architectural Terra Cotta|journal=APT Bulletin|date=2016|volume=47| issue = 2/3|pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design ===
Academically trained artists were often the designers of the terracotta forms. Their drawings would be interpreted by the manufacturer who would plan out the joint locations and anchoring system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Standardization of terracotta anchorage: an analysis of shop drawings from the Northwestern Terra Cotta Company and the O.W. Ketcham Terra Cotta Works|last=Didden|first=Amanda|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|year=2003|isbn=|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once finalized, the drawings were turned into a plaster reality by sculptors who would create the mold for the craftsmen.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mack|first1=Robert C.|date=1983|title=The Manufacture and Use of Architectural Terra Cotta in the United States|journal=The Technology of Historic American Buildings|pages=117–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clay preparation ===
Clay selection was very important to manufacture of terracotta. Homogenous, finer grain sizes were preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Terracotta|journal=Scientific American|date=1872|volume=no. 14|issue=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; The color of the clay body was determined by the types of deposits that were locally available to the manufacture. Sand was added to temper the process. Crushed ceramic scraps called grog were also added to stiffen the product and help reduce shrinkage.

Weathering the clay allowed pyrites to chemically change to hydrated ferric oxide and reduced alkali content. This aging minimizes the potential chemical changes during the rest of the manufacturing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mack|first1=Robert C.|title=The Manufacture and Use of Architectural Terra Cotta in the United States|journal=The Technology of Historic American Buildings|date=1983|pages=117–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weathered raw clay was dried, ground, and screened. Later, it would have been pugged in a mill that would mix the clay with water using rotating blades and force the blend through a sieve.

=== Hand pressing terracotta ===
An artist makes a negative plaster mold based on a clay positive prototype. 1–1¼" of the clay/water mixture is pressed into the mold. Wire mesh or other stiffeners are added to create the web, or clay body that surrounds the hollow cell. The product is air dried to allow the plaster to suck the moisture out of the green clay product. It is fired then slowly cooled.&lt;ref name="Architectural Terra Cotta"/&gt;

=== Extrusion ===
Mechanized [[extrusion]] was used for the mass-production of terracotta blocks, popular in the 1920s. Prepared clay was fed into a machine that would then push the mix through a mold. The technique required the blocks to be made with simple shapes, so this process was often used for flooring, roofing, cladding, and later hollow clay tiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Terra-Cotta Skyline: New York's Architectural Ornament|last=Tunick|first=Susan|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Glazing ===
The last step before firing the greenware was [[Glazed architectural terra-cotta|glazing]]. True glazes are made from various salts but prior to the 1890s most blocks were slip glazed or coated with a watered-down version of the clay mix. Liquefying the clay increased the amount of small silica particles that would be deposited on the surface of the block. These would melt during firing and harden. By 1900 almost all colors could be achieved with the addition of salt glazes. Black or brown were made by adding manganese oxide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Art Museum pediment.jpg|thumb|[[Philadelphia Museum of Art|Philadelphia Art Museum]]'s terracotta pediment using polychrome glazing]]

=== Firing ===

The [[kiln]] firing process could take days, up to two weeks. The clay is heated slowly to around 500°C to sweat off the loose or macroscopic water between the molecules. Then the temperature is increased to close to 900°C to release the chemically bonded water in gaseous form and the clay particles will begin to melt together or sinter. If the kiln reaches 1000°C then the clay particles will vitrtify and become glass like. After the maximum temperature was reached then the clay was slowly cooled over a few days. During firing a fireskin is created. A fireskin is the glass like "bread crust" that covers the biscuit or interior body.

Various kilns were used as technology developed and capital was available for investment. Muffle kilns were the most common kiln. They were used as early as 1870. The kilns burned gas, coal, or oil that heated an interior chamber from an exterior chamber. The walls "muffled" the heat so the greenware was not directly exposed to the flames.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Down-draught kilns were also widely used. The interior chamber radiated heat around the terracotta by pulling in hot air from behind an exterior cavity wall. Like the muffle wall, the cavity wall protected the greenware from burning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Installation ===
The earliest terracotta elements were laid directly into the masonry but as structural metal became more popular terracotta was suspended by metal anchors. The development of cast and later wrought iron as a structural material was closely linked to the rise of terracotta. Cast iron was first used as columns in the 1820s by William Strickland. Over the course of the 19th century metal became more incorporated into construction but it was not widely used structurally until the late 1890s.

A series of disastrous fires ([[Great Chicago Fire|Chicago, 1871]]; [[Great Boston fire of 1872|Boston, 1872]]; and [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|San Francisco, 1906]]) earned terracotta a reputation for being a fireproof, lightweight cladding material that could protect metal from melting. Holes were bored in the hollow blocks in choice locations to allow for metal 'J' or 'Z' hooks to connect the blocks to the load bearing steel frame and/or masonry walls. The metal could be hung vertically or anchored horizontally. Pins, clamps, clips, plates, and a variety of other devices were used to help secure the blocks. The joints would then be mortared and the block would be partially backfilled.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Detail on E Collonade.jpg|thumb|Cracking caused by corroding metal anchors at the [[First Congregational Church (Long Beach, California)|First Congregational Church]] of [[Long Beach, California]]]]

== Degradation ==
The most common reasons for terracotta to fail are: poor manufacturing, improper installation, weathering, freeze/thaw cycling, and salt formation from atmospheric pollution. The porosity of terracotta greatly impacts its performance. The ability or inability for water and pollutants to enter into the material is directly correlated to its structural capacity. Terracotta is very strong in compression but weak in tension and shear strength. Any anomalous material expanding (ice, salts, incompatible fill material, or corroding metal anchors) inside the clay body will cause it to crack and eventually [[spall]].

Inherent faults can severely impact the performance of the material. Improper molding can cause air pockets to form that increase the rate of deterioration. If the block is not fired or cooled properly than the fireskin will not be uniformly adhered to the substrate and can flake off. Likewise, if a glaze is not fired properly it will crack, flake, and fall off. Discolorations can result from mineral impurities such as pyrites or barium carbonates.
 
A fair amount of damage comes from clumsy transportation, storage, or installation of the material. If the mortar used around and inside the blocks is too strong then the stress will be translated to the terracotta block which will fail over time. Corroding interior metal anchors expand at a faster rate than the surrounding ceramic body causing it to fail from the inside out. Improper loading of the hollow terracotta blocks can create stress cracks.

The environment also plays a large role in the survival of terracotta. Different types of air pollution can cause different types of surface problems. When it rains, water and salts get sucked into the voids in and around the terracotta through capillary action. If it freezes then ice forms, putting internal stress on the material, causing it to crack from inside. A similar problem happens with atmospheric pollutants that are carried into the gaps by rains water. The pollution creates a mildly acidic solution that eats at the clay body or a salt crust forms, causing similar issues as ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/tps/how-to-preserve/briefs/7-terra-cotta.htm#analysis|title=The Preservation of Historic Glazed Architectural Terra-cotta|last=Patterson Tiller|first=de Teel|date=1979|website=National Park Service|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian Law Reform Commission''' (often abbreviated to '''ALRC''') is an [[Australia]]n independent statutory body established to conduct reviews into the [[law of Australia]].The reviews, also called inquiries or references, are referred to the ALRC by the Attorney-General of Australia.  Based on its research and consultations throughout an inquiry, the ALRC makes recommendations to government so that government can make informed decisions about law reform.  

The ALRC is part of the Attorney-General's portfolio, however it is an independent statutory authority constituted under the ''Australian Law Reform Commission Act 1996'' (Cth), and the ''Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013'' (PGPA Act). As an independent agency, it is able to undertake research, consultations and legal policy development, and to make recommendations to the Parliament, without fear or favour.

The ALRC's objective is to make recommendations for law reform that:
    
* bring the law into line with current conditions and needs
*     remove defects in the law
*     simplify the law
*     adopt new or more effective methods for administering the law and dispensing justice, and
*     provide improved access to justice.

When conducting an inquiry, the ALRC also monitors overseas legal systems to ensure Australia compares favourably with international best practice.

The ALRC aims to ensure that the proposals and recommendations it makes do not trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties of citizens, or make those rights and liberties unduly dependent on administrative, rather than judicial, decisions and, as far as practicable, are consistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

The ALRC must also have regard to any effect that its recommendations may have on the costs of access to, and dispensing of, justice.

==Background==
The ALRC is the primary law reform agency for the [[Australian government]]. It has its origins in the Law Reform Commission,&lt;ref name="NAA CA 2531"&gt;{{citation|title=CA 2531: Law Reform Commission|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/SearchOld.asp?Number=CA+2531|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was established in 1975 under the ''Law Reform Commission Act 1973''. This legislation was superseded by the ''Australian Law Reform Commission Act 1996'' (Cth) (the ALRC Act) which came into effect on 11 November 1996. The new act was intended to improve the structure and functions of the ALRC, consistent with the recommendations of the 1994 Report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs titled, ''Law Reform—the Challenge Continues''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard|jurisdiction=Commonwealth of Australia|house=House of Representatives |speaker=[[Daryl Williams (politician)|Daryl Williams]]|date=20 June 1996|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/reps/dailys/dr200696.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123163603/http://aph.gov.au/hansard/reps/dailys/dr200696.pdf|archivedate=23 November 2011 |page_start=2451|page_end=2453|title=House of representatives - Official Hansard - Thursday, 20 June 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitution==
Under the amendments to the ALRC Act in 2012, the Commission consists of a President and up to 6 other members. The performance of the Commission’s functions, and the exercise of its powers, are not affected merely because of 1 or more vacancies in its membership. The Attorney‑General may, from time to time, appoint such other part‑time members of the Commission as the Attorney‑General considers necessary to enable the Commission to perform its functions. Full-time members are to be appointed by the Governor‑General and part-time members are to be appointed by the Attorney-General.  A member holds office for the term (of at least 6 months but not longer than 5 years) specified in his or her appointment, but is eligible for re‑appointment.

==Law reform process==
The process for each law reform project may differ according to the scope of inquiry, and the ALRC usually works within a particular framework when it develops recommendations for reform.  An Inquiry begins with Terms of Reference delivered by the Australian Attorney-General identifying an area of law that needs to be reviewed for various reasons including:
* there is community concern about a particular issue that needs to be addressed through the process of law reform
* recent events or legal cases have highlighted a deficiency with the law
* scientific or technological developments have made it necessary to update the law or create new laws.
An [https://www.alrc.gov.au/publications?inquiry-tid=All&amp;topic-tid=All&amp;type-tid=115&amp;year-tid=All Issues Paper] is usually the first official publication of an inquiry. It provides a preliminary look at issues surrounding the inquiry.  It serves to educate the community about the range of the problems under consideration.
[https://www.alrc.gov.au/publications?inquiry-tid=All&amp;topic-tid=All&amp;type-tid=116&amp;year-tid=All Discussion Papers] provide a detailed account of ALRC research, including a summary of the various consultations and submissions undertaken and received, and set out draft proposals for reform. 
The ALRC makes a formal call for submissions whenever it releases an Issues Paper or Discussion Paper. Through the submissions it receives, the ALRC can gauge what people think about current laws, how they should be changed and can test its proposals for reform with stakeholders before finalising them.
[https://www.alrc.gov.au/publications?inquiry-tid=All&amp;topic-tid=All&amp;type-tid=109&amp;year-tid=All ALRC Final Reports] make specific recommendations for changes to the law or legal processes. In formulating recommendations, the ALRC draws not only on submissions, but also face to face consultations, academic and industry research, international research and models, and its considerable experience in law reform. The ALRC seeks to consult with people who have expertise and experience in the laws under review, as well as people likely to be affected by the laws in question.
During the process of formulating recommendations, the ALRC has regard to any policy aims expressed in terms of Reference and the principles for reform identified for each particular inquiry, against which possible proposals are assessed.
The Attorney-General is required to table the Final Report in Parliament within 15 sitting days of receiving it, after which it can be made available to the public.
The Australian Government decides whether to implement the recommendations, in whole or in part.

==Inquiries into the ALRC==
Throughout the history of the ALRC there have been a number of inquiries into its role, constitution and functions. They include:
* 1977-1979 [http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/9578476?q&amp;sort=holdings+desc&amp;_=1423196485856&amp;versionId=44726698 Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry] into the processing of law reform proposals.
* 1993-1994 [http://www.alrc.gov.au/sites/default/files/pdfs/publications/1994Report.pdf House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs]. This was the first review of the Commission’s performance, structure and overall method of operation.

−	
A professional appointed by the bankruptcy court to investigate and oversee certain aspects of the debtor or the proceedings.  By way of comparison, the role of the trustee is to operate the business of the debtor whereas the role of the examiner is to investigate and report to the court.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bankruptcydata.com/Glossary.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In bankruptcy cases, an examiner refers to an officer appointed by a bankruptcy for the purpose of reviewing certain aspects of the operation of a Chapter 11 debtor. Although his/her main function is investigation, an examiner is usually called as mediators to assist the court in resolving bankruptcy disputes. An Examiner can be appointed in complicated Chapter 11 case involving a utility with instructions to investigate fraud and other irregularities, and to mediate and assist in breaking a deadlock in plan negotiations.

* storing, holding, or maintaining custody or control of virtual currency on behalf of others;
* buying and selling virtual currency as a customer business;
* performing Exchange Services as a customer business, or;
* controlling, administering, or issuing a virtual currency.

The two following activities are excluded from the definition of virtual currency business activity:

* merchants and consumers that utilize virtual currency solely for the purchase or sale of goods or services or for investment purposes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''California Society of Municipal Finance Officers''' (or CSMFO) is a [[professional association]] of state, [[County (United States)|county]], and [[local government]] finance officers in [[California]].  The California Society of Municipal Finance Officers is the statewide organization serving all California municipal finance professionals, an affiliate of the nationwide Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA).  Membership is open to anyone in the State of California actively engaged in government finance in any [[city]], county, or [[Special-purpose district|special district]].  Its stated mission is to  promote excellence in financial management through innovation, continuing education and professional development.  CSMFO members are actively involved in the key issues facing cities, counties, and special districts in the State of California.

Recognizing that public servants have an obligation to serve the public’s interests, CSMFO serves to actively improve fiscal integrity, adherence to the highest standards of ethical conduct, and to create better accountability by disseminating best practices.

==The Challenge to Excellence in Government Finance ==

The [[Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990]](CFO Act) was signed into law by President [[George H.W. Bush]]. For each of 23 federal agencies, the position of chief financial officer was created. Since that time, federal efforts have been intended to improve the government's financial management and develop standards of financial performance and disclosure. Similar financial expectations exist at State and Local government levels.

The [[chief financial officer]] (CFO) of a public agency is the corporate officer primarily responsible for managing the financial risks of the business or agency. This officer is also responsible for budgeting, financial planning, record-keeping, cash flow management, higher management. communicating financial performance and forecasts to the community. The title may vary, such as finance director or treasurer, from agency to agency. The CFO typically reports to the city manager or other chief executive officer.

Financial reporting has multiple audiences, with a responsibility to citizens, taxpayers and voters to provide transparent accountability for use of public funds (taxes).  Additionally, financial reporting must provide internal guidance to program managers to maintain budgetary control and to governing city councils and boards of directors to provide adequate financial policy guidelines.

The United States government in general has sought to improve the quality of financial reporting.  The Government Accounting Standards Board ([[Governmental Accounting Standards Board|GASB]]) has a stated mission to "establish and improve standards of state and local governmental accounting and financial reporting that will result in useful information for users of financial reports and guide and educate the public, including issuers, auditors, and users of those financial reports." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gasb.org/ Government Accounting Standards Board]&lt;/ref&gt; Pronouncements in particular have trended to incorporate more comparable elements of business-sector.

The need for and value of financial managers has increased. Over the past decades, a number of factors have created a rapidly changing environment for today's government financial managers.  Beginning with the [[New York City]] financial crisis in the 1970s and 1980s, state and local governments began overhauling their financial management systems. In 1990, the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) act called for reforms that brought the goal of accountability to the forefront.  The 1994 Bankruptcy of [[Orange County, California]] further underscored the need for ongoing excellence and expertise in the field of municipal finance.

==Role of CSMFO Membership==
Members are finance directors and treasurers of municipalities and other local government agencies, whether elected or appointed, having responsibility for collection, receipt, reporting, custody, investment or disbursement of municipal funds.  Municipal funding sources are commonly [[property tax]], [[sales tax]], [[income tax]], utility users tax (UUT), transient occupancy tax (hotel occupancy), and user fees such as licensing and permit fees.

Michael Genest is the [[Finance Director]] and [[Bill Lockyer]] is the [[Treasurer]] of the [[State of California]].  There are 480 California cities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca.gov/About/Government/Local/cities.html State of California, Cities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428195928/http://www.ca.gov/About/Government/Local/cities.html |date=2012-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 58 [[California counties]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca.gov/About/Government/Local/counties.html State of California, Counties ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527094654/http://www.ca.gov/About/Government/Local/counties.html |date=2010-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; about 3,400 [[Special Districts]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterplan.water.ca.gov/docs/cwpu2005/vol4/vol4-background-whatssospecialaboutspecialdistricts.pdf A Citizen's Guide to Special Districts in California] Retrieved 2009-04-04&lt;/ref&gt; and School Districts, each with independent fiscal stewardship.  Many City Treasurers are elected, and are therefore directly accountable to their constituents; the remainder are appointed either by City Council or City Manager.  Finance Directors typically are appointed by the City Manager.

==Professional Standards Setting==
Certification is a guide for municipal finance directors and treasurers to become valued administrators in local government.  CSMFO encourages [[professional certification]] for public finance directors and treasurers who meet standards of education, experience and commitment to a [[code of ethics]].  CSMFO does not offer its own [[post-nominal]] professional certificate since GFOA already administers the Certified Professional Finance Officer (CPFO), CMTA offers the [[Certified California Municipal Treasurer]] (CCMT) certification program,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cacities.org/index.jsp?displaytype=11&amp;story=23047&amp;zone=ilsg&amp;section=conf&amp;sub_sec=conf_codes Institute for Local Government, Ethics Codes]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Association of Government Accountants offers the [[Certified Government Financial Manager]] (CGFM) certification, requiring six hours of testing on Federal, State and Local Government Financial material.

==CSMFO Code of Ethics==

Members are enjoined to adhere to legal, moral and professional standards of conduct. The following ethical principles govern the conduct of the Municipal members of the California Society of Municipal Finance Officers who shall:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmfo.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Detail&amp;CID=4&amp;NavID=154 CSMFO Code of Ethics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926062024/http://www.csmfo.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Detail&amp;CID=4&amp;NavID=154# |date=2006-09-26 }} Retrieved 2009-04-08&lt;/ref&gt;

10. Seek no favor or accept any personal gain which would influence, or appear to influence, the conduct of their official duties.

11. Protect the [[public trust]], avoid even the appearance of impropriety, and safeguard the [[integrity]] of the [[government]] they serve.

==Training and Education in California Finance and Treasury==
CSMFO has technical and professional committees that deal with financial issues facing government and the public.  CSMFO also provides web-based technical support resources, educational material, conferences and technical publications for its members.  CSMFO's annual statewide conferences provide an array of education across many topics and alternate annually between various northern and southern cities.  By assembling leadership from a broad representation of government agencies and also bringing in subject matter experts in various disciplines, the collective expertise and professionalism of financial managers and policymakers is enhanced and improved.

==Statewide Financial Leadership==
CSMFO is recognized as a leading source of expert knowledge in public financial management by exercising leadership in research, recommended practice and policy development, and information dissemination.  Nationwide recognition is furthered through a continued association with the nationwide Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA).  Statewide recognition is furthered through a thorough participation of members drawn from many cities, counties and special districts.

Standing Committees
Financial Leadership is furthered by engaging in efforts to assist statewide finance officers to develop the skills and capabilities necessary to enable them to become organizational leaders as well as technical experts.  &lt;br&gt;

==Resources==
The CSMFO website is a well-known statewide resource for a variety of documents relevant to local government, the most obvious benefit of which is to avoid inefficient duplication of effort and to make more knowledge available statewide to everyone.  CSMFO's library of resources includes sample RFPs, job descriptions, and a variety of documents and information relevant to local government.  Categories of posted information include Accounting/Financial Reporting, Budgeting, Consultants, Investments/Cash Management, Job Descriptions, Payroll, Human Resources, Policies &amp; Procedures, Revenue Management, RFPs/RFQs, and Technology.

CSMFO facilitates interagency communication for the purposes of sharing information and best practices.  Cooperate with and complement the services provided by other organizations to increase the effectiveness of all.

Like GFOA nationwide, CSMFO sponsors award programs designed to encourage good financial reporting in California, for financial documents including the [[Comprehensive annual financial report]], or CAFR, and the annual [[budget]].

CSMFO provides technology information and analytical tools to help governments identify and apply appropriate, economical technologies to support efficient resource allocation, quality services, and effective decision making and to promote citizen involvement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23187">'''Central solar heating''' is the provision of [[central heating]] and [[water heating|hot water]] from [[solar energy]] by a system in which the water is heated centrally by arrays of [[solar hot water panel|solar thermal collectors]] ('''central solar heating plants''' - CSHPs) and distributed through [[district heating]] pipe networks (or 'block heating' systems in the case of smaller installations).

For block systems, the solar collectors are typically mounted on the building roof tops. For district heating systems the collectors may instead be installed on the ground.

Central solar heating can involve large-scale [[Thermal energy storage|thermal storage]], scaling from diurnal storage to [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES). Thermal storage increase the [[solar fraction]] - the ratio between solar energy gain to the total energy demand in the system - for solar thermal systems. Ideally, the aim for applying seasonal storage is to store solar energy collected in the summer time to the winter month.

Compared to small solar heating systems ([[solar combisystem]]s), central solar heating systems have better price-performance ratios due to the lower installation price, the higher thermal efficiency and less maintenance. In some countries such as [[Denmark]] large-scale solar district heating plants are financially fully competitive to other forms of heat generation.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Perez‐Mora et al.: ''Solar district heating and cooling: A review''. [[International Journal of Energy Research]] 42, 4, 2018, 1419-1441 {{DOI|10.1002/er.3888}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Central solar systems can also be used for [[Solar air conditioning|solar cooling]] in the form of [[district cooling]]. In this case, the overall efficiency is high due to the high correlation between the energy demand and the solar radiation.

Hereafter you find a plant in Rise (DK) with a new collector producer, Marstal VVS (DK), a plant in Ry (DK), one of the oldest in Europe, a plant in Hamburg and a number of plants below 3,000 m². It may be relevant mentioning, that the island of Ærø in Denmark has three of the major CSHP, Marstal, Ærøskøping and Rise.

==History of central solar heating plants==
{{Globalize|date=May 2010}}
:''The history of CSHP given here is mainly a Nordic-European perspective on the topic.''

[[Sweden]] has played a major role in the development of large-scale solar heating. According to (Dalenbäck, J-O., 1993), the first steps were taken in the early seventies in [[Linköping]], Sweden, followed by a mature revision in 1983 in [[Lyckebo]], Sweden. Inspired by this work, [[Finland]] developed its first plant in [[Kerava]], and the [[Netherlands]] built a first plant in [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]. These plants are reported under the [[International Energy Agency]] by (Dalenbäck, J-O., 1990). Note that these plants did already combine CSHPs with large-scale thermal storage.

The first large-scale solar collector fields were made on-site in [[Torvalle]], Sweden, 1982, 2000 m² and [[Malung]], Sweden, 640 m². Prefabricated collector arrays were introduced in [[Nykvarn]], Sweden, 4000 m² in 1985. There was from the beginning a strong international perspective and cooperation within this research field, through investigation with the European Communities (Dalenbäck, J-O., 1995) and the International Energy Agency (Dalenbäck, J-O., 1990). Denmark did enter this research area parallel to the Swedish activities with a plant in [[Vester Nebel]] in 1987, one plant in [[Saltum]] in 1988 and one in [[Ry, Denmark|Ry]] in 1989, taking over the know-how for prefabricated solar collectors of large size by the Swedish company Teknoterm by the dominating company ARCON, Denmark. In the later 1990s [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]] were active among others with plants in [[Stuttgart]] and [[Chemnitz]].

Due to cheap land prices, in the Nordic countries new collector arrays are ground-mounted (concrete foundations or [[Pile driver|pile-driven]] steel) in suitable areas (low-yield agricultural, industry etc.). Countries with high ground prices tend to place solar collectors on building roofs, following the 'block plant' variant of CSHPs. In Northern Europe, 20% solar heat of annual heating requirement is the economic optimum in a district heating plant when using above-ground storage tanks. If pond storage is used, the solar contribution can reach 50%.&lt;ref name=ing2015-10-23&gt;Wittrup, Sanne. "[https://ing.dk/artikel/dansk-solteknologi-mod-nye-verdensrekorder-179658 Dansk solteknologi mod nye verdensrekorder]" ''[[Ingeniøren]]'', 23 October 2015. Accessed: 16 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1999 40 CSHPs were in operation in [[Europe]] generating about 30 [[Megawatt|MW]] of thermal power [http://wire0.ises.org/wire/doclibs/EuroSun98.nsf/c1223aa2046dd602c1256927007e9e65/1a880e3f0ced45fcc1256771003045f0!OpenDocument].

==Related systems==
Central solar heating is a sub-class of 'large-scale solar heating' systems - a term applied to systems with solar collector areas greater than 500 m².

In [[Alberta, Canada]] the [[Drake Landing Solar Community]] has achieved a world record 97% annual solar fraction for heating needs, using solar-thermal panels on the garage roofs and thermal storage in a borehole cluster.&lt;ref&gt;Wong B., Thornton J. (2013). [http://www.geo-exchange.ca/en/UserAttachments/flex1304_5-%20SAIC-%20Bill%20Wong%202013%20-%20Integrating%20Solar%20and%20Heat%20Pumps.pdf Integrating Solar &amp; Heat Pumps].

{{cite bailii|litigants='''Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police v Wigan Athletic AFC Ltd'''|year=2008|court=EWCA|div=Civ|num=1449}} is an [[English unjust enrichment]] case, concerning the meaning of enrichment.

==Facts==
[[Wigan Athletic AFC]] was required to pay for additional policing at its grounds. Without this, they could not hold matches except in breach of the safety certificate issued under the [[Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975]]. It claimed this was unlawful.

==Judgment==
The Court of Appeal (by a majority) held that it was not unjust for the football club to refuse to pay for policing at the additional level stipulated by the Chief Constable.

As the passages in [[Goff &amp; Jones]] on restitution to which I have referred make clear, a benefit from services rendered which is neither "incontrovertible" nor requested may be established by their "free acceptance". But the concept of free acceptance, as explained in para 1-019, requires that the recipient "did not take a reasonable opportunity open to him to reject the proffered services". The relevant services were the supply of special police services at the level, in excess of that provided in the season 2002/03, to which the Club objected. The Club was unable to reject those services unless it also rejected the services which it did want and had requested. To do that would have meant that the Club could not play their home matches in the Stadium at all. In my view it is clear that there was no free acceptance of the services in dispute because the Club were, in practice, unable to reject them alone.

[...]

50. The third necessary ingredient is an "unjust factor". Given the unusual circumstances of this case I do not think there is one. There was, as Mann J observed, an impasse. Neither Mr Mason nor the Club would back down. But whereas Mr Mason might, at least experimentally, have reduced the level of policing, for the Club it was all or nothing. Either they accepted policing at the level Mr Mason required and paid for it or they stopped playing their home matches at the Stadium. Even if policing at the higher level Mr Mason insisted on is regarded as a benefit to the Club I do not consider that the Club should be made to pay for it given the "[[Hobson's choice|Hobson's Choice]]" with which it was faced.}}

The '''Christian Legal Society''' ('''CLS''') is an American non-profit, non-denominational organization of [[Christian]] [[lawyer]]s, [[judge]]s, law professors, and law students and friends whose members profess to follow the "commandment of [[Jesus]]" to "seek [[justice]] with the love of [[God]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 11:42; [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 23:23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society has a legal arm, The Center for Law &amp; Religious Freedom, for litigation purposes especially in favor of religious freedom, submitting ''[[amicus curiae]]'' legal briefs in cases involving important religious freedom issues, representing parties in religious liberty issues,&lt;ref name="CLSWEBSITE"&gt;Cf. CLS website&lt;/ref&gt; and legislative work.

CLS publications include ''The Christian Lawyer'', ''The Journal of Christian Legal Thought'', ''CLS Bible Studies'', and ''CLS E-Devotionals'' (bi-weekly). Its former publications include the ''Quarterly, The Defender, and the Religious Freedom Reporter'' (all of which can be obtained at HeinOnline [http://home.heinonline.org/content/catalog-search/?type=word&amp;type_in=select&amp;termsa=christian+legal+society&amp;x=0&amp;y=0]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}).

CLS receives no government support for any of its programs or ministries and is supported by dues, donations and gifts.

The Christian Legal Society holds an annual convention in the United States and various regional conferences.

== History ==
The organization, which is based in the [[United States]], was founded in [[Chicago, Illinois]] in 1961 by four lawyers (Paul Bernard, Gerrit P. Groen, Henry Luke Brinks, and Elmer Johnson) who had met at a convention of the [[American Bar Association]] in 1959 to [[prayer|pray]] together.

Since its founding, it has grown to include nearly 50 attorney chapters, over 120 law school chapters, and four unincorporated ministry divisions.

== Membership ==
CLS membership includes attorneys, judges, law students, and others who profess their commitment to the CLS Statement of Faith. They are organized in more than 1100 cities into attorney chapters, law student chapters, and fellowships throughout the United States.

Membership in the Christian Legal Society is open to all who believe in and sign CLS’ Statement of Faith.&lt;ref&gt;http://clsnet.org/page.aspx?pid=367&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals ==
Since its founding in 1961, CLS’ nine organizational objectives, as set forth in its amended not-for-profit articles of incorporation, have been:&lt;ref&gt;CLS, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070911050420/http://www.clsnet.org/clsPages/vision.php "Vision of CLS"] - CLS website (archived 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
* To proclaim Jesus as Lord through all that we do in the field of law and other disciplines;
* To provide a means of society, fellowship and nurture among Christian lawyers;
* To encourage Christian lawyers to view law as ministry;
* To clarify and promote the concept of the Christian lawyer and to help Christian lawyers integrate their faith with their professional lives;
* To mobilize, at the national and local levels, the resources needed to promote justice, religious liberty, the inalienable right to human life, and biblical conflict reconciliation
* To encourage, disciple and aid Christian students in preparing for the legal profession;
* To provide a forum for the discussion of problems and opportunities relating to Christianity and the law;
* To cooperate with bar associations and other organizations in asserting and maintaining high standards of legal ethics; and,
* To encourage lawyers to furnish legal services to the poor and needy, and grant special consideration to the legal needs of churches and other charitable organizations.

The '''Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation''' (SUA) or '''Sua Act''' is a [[multilateral treaty]] by which states agree to prohibit and punish behaviour which may threaten the safety of maritime navigation.

==Content==
The Convention is based upon the 1971 [[Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation]] and the [[Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft]] and criminalises similar behaviour in the context of maritime navigation.

The Convention [[criminalization|criminalises]] the following behaviour:
#Seizing control of a ship by force or threat of force;
#committing an act of violence against a person on ship if it is likely to endanger the safety of the ship;
#destroying or damaging a ship or its cargo in such a way that endangers the safe navigation of the ship;
#placing or causing to be placed on a ship a device or substance which is likely to destroy or cause damage to the ship or its cargo;
#destroying or damaging a ship's navigation facilities or interfering with their operation if it is likely to endanger the safety of the ship;
#communicating information which is known to be false, thereby endangering the safety of the navigation of a ship;
#injuring or killing anyone while committing 1–6;
#attempting any of 1–7;
#being an accomplice to any of 1–8; and
#compelling another through threats to commit any of 1–9.

The Convention sets out the principle of ''[[aut dedere aut judicare]]''—that a state party to the treaty must either (1) prosecute a person who commits one of the offences or (2) send the individual to another state that requests his or her [[extradition]] for prosecution of the same crime.

The Convention does not apply to:
#A warship; or
#a ship owned or operated by a State when being used as a naval auxiliary or for customs or police purposes; or
#a ship which has been withdrawn from navigation or laid up.

Nothing in the convention  affects the immunities of warships and other government ships operated for non-commercial purposes.

==Creation and entry into force==
The Convention was adopted by the International Conference on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation at Rome on 10 March 1988. It came into force on 1 March 1992 after it had been ratified by 15 states.

==State parties==
As of June 2015, the Convention has 166 state parties, which includes 164 [[UN member states]] plus the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]]. The 166 states represent 94.5 per cent of the gross tonnage of the world's merchant fleet.

The following are the 29 UN member states that are ''not'' party to the Convention. An asterisk beside the state indicates that the state is not a [[landlocked country]] and thus has maritime coastline.

None of the 29 non-member states has signed SUA.

==SUA Protocol==
The [[Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf]] (SUA PROT) was concluded at the same time as SUA. The Protocol came into force at the same time as SUA. SUA PROT is a supplementary convention to SUA.

==2005 Protocol==
In London on 14 October 2005, a second supplementary Protocol to SUA was concluded. The full name of the Protocol is the '''Protocol of 2005 to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation''' and is often abbreviated as "SUA 2005". The 2005 Protocol adds provisions which criminalises the use of ships to transfer or discharge [[biological weapon|biological]], [[chemical weapon|chemical]], or [[nuclear weapon]]s. (However, the Protocol specifies that transporting nuclear materials is not an offence if it is transported to or from the territory or under the control of a state party to the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]].) It also prohibits ships from discharging oil, [[liquefied natural gas]], [[radioactivity|radioactive]] materials, or other hazardous or noxious substances in quantities or concentrations that are likely to cause death or serious injury or damage. Finally, it prohibits the use of such weapons or substances against ships involved in maritime navigation.

The 2005 Protocol came into force on 28 July 2010 and as of February 2016 has been ratified by 40 states.

{{Basel II}}
A '''credit risk''' is the risk of [[default (finance)|default]] on a debt that may arise from a borrower failing to make required payments.&lt;ref name=bcbs&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles for the Management of Credit Risk – final document|url=http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs75.htm|work=Basel Committee on Banking Supervision|publisher=BIS|accessdate=13 December 2013|date=September 2000|quote=Credit risk is umost simply defined as the potential that a bank borrower or counterparty will fail to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed terms.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first resort, the risk is that of the lender and includes lost [[principal sum|principal]] and [[interest]], disruption to [[cash flow]]s, and increased [[collection cost]]s. The loss may be complete or partial. In an efficient market, higher levels of credit risk will be associated with higher borrowing costs.&lt;ref name="ALI"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simkovic|first1=Michael|title=What Can We Learn from Credit Markets|journal=Proceedings of the 93rd Annual Meeting of the American Law Institute|date=2016|ssrn=2782844}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this, measures of borrowing costs such as [[yield spread]]s can be used to infer credit risk levels based on assessments by market participants.&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Simkovic|editor1-last=Adler|editor1-first=Barry|title=Making Fraudulent Transfer Law More Predictable, in Handbook on Corporate Bankruptcy|date=2016|publisher=Edward Elgar|ssrn=2775920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LBO"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simkovic|first1=Michael|last2=Kaminetzky|first2=Benjamin|title=Leveraged Buyout Bankruptcies, the Problem of Hindsight Bias, and the Credit Default Swap Solution|journal=Columbia Business Law Review|date=2011|volume=2011|page=118|ssrn=1632084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Losses can arise in a number of circumstances,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riskglossary.com/link/credit_risk.htm Risk Glossary: Credit Risk]&lt;/ref&gt; for example:

* A consumer may fail to make a payment due on a [[mortgage loan]], [[credit card]], [[line of credit]], or other loan.
* A [[company]] is unable to repay asset-secured fixed or [[floating charge]] debt.
* A business or consumer does not pay a [[trade credit|trade invoice]] when due.
* A business does not pay an employee's earned [[wage]]s when due.
* A business or government [[Bond (finance)|bond]] issuer does not make a payment on a [[Coupon (bond)|coupon]] or principal payment when due.
* An insolvent [[insurance company]] does not pay a policy obligation.
* An insolvent [[bank]] won't return funds to a depositor.
* A government grants [[bankruptcy]] protection to an [[insolvency|insolvent]] consumer or business.

To reduce the lender's credit risk, the lender may perform a [[credit check]] on the prospective borrower, may require the borrower to take out appropriate insurance, such as [[mortgage insurance]], or seek [[Security (finance)|security]] over some assets of the borrower or a [[guarantee]] from a third party. The lender can also take out insurance against the risk or on-sell the debt to another company. In general, the higher the risk, the higher will be the [[interest rate]] that the debtor will be asked to pay on the debt.
Credit risk mainly arises when borrowers are unable to pay due willingly or unwillingly.

== Types ==
A credit risk can be of the following types:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicreditgroup.eu/en/investors/risk-management/credit.html Credit Risk Classification] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927181311/https://www.unicreditgroup.eu/en/investors/risk-management/credit.html |date=2013-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Credit default risk – The risk of loss arising from a debtor being unlikely to pay its loan obligations in full or the debtor is more than 90 days past due on any material credit obligation; default risk may impact all credit-sensitive transactions, including loans, securities and [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]].
* [[Concentration risk]] – The risk associated with any single exposure or group of exposures with the potential to produce large enough losses to threaten a bank's core operations. It may arise in the form of single name concentration or industry concentration.
* [[Country risk]] – The risk of loss arising from a sovereign state freezing foreign currency payments (transfer/conversion risk) or when it defaults on its obligations (sovereign risk); this type of risk is prominently associated with the country's macroeconomic performance and its political stability.

== Assessment ==
{{Main article|Credit analysis|Consumer credit risk}}
Significant resources and sophisticated programs are used to analyze and manage risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs126.htm BIS Paper:Sound credit risk assessment and valuation for loans]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brkic|first=Sabina|last2=Hodzic|first2=Migdat|last3=Dzanic|first3=Enis|date=2018-07-02|title=Soft Data Modeling Via Type 2 Fuzzy Distributions for Corporate Credit Risk Assessment in Commercial Banking|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3206607|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies run a credit risk department whose job is to assess the financial health of their customers, and extend credit (or not) accordingly. They may use in-house programs to advise on avoiding, reducing and transferring risk. They also use third party provided intelligence. Companies like [[Standard &amp; Poor's]], [[Moody's]], [[Fitch Ratings]], [[DBRS]], [[Dun and Bradstreet]], [[Bureau van Dijk]] and [[Rapid Ratings International]] provide such information for a fee.

For large companies with liquidly traded corporate bonds or Credit Default Swaps, bond yield spreads and credit default swap spreads indicate market participants assessments of credit risk and may be used as a reference point to price loans or trigger collateral calls.&lt;ref name="LBO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FT" /&gt;

Most lenders employ their own models ([[credit scorecards]]) to rank potential and existing customers according to risk, and then apply appropriate strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crc.man.ed.ac.uk/conference/archive/2007/papers/huang-and-scott.pdf Huang and Scott:Credit Risk Scorecard Design, Validation and User Acceptance]&lt;/ref&gt; With products such as unsecured personal loans or mortgages, lenders charge a higher price for higher risk customers and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-based_mortgage_pricing.asp Investopedia: Risk-based mortgage pricing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crc.man.ed.ac.uk/conference/archive/2003/presentations/edelman.pdf Edelman: Risk based pricing for personal loans]&lt;/ref&gt; With revolving products such as credit cards and overdrafts, risk is controlled through the setting of credit limits. Some products also require [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]], usually an asset that is pledged to secure the repayment of the loan.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Allen N., and Gregory F. Udell. "Collateral, loan quality and bank risk."Journal of Monetary Economics 25.1 (1990): 21–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Credit scoring models also form part of the framework used by banks or lending institutions to grant credit to clients.&lt;ref name="JarrowLando1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarrow|first1=R. A.|last2=Lando|first2=D.|last3=Turnbull|first3=S. M.|title=A Markov Model for the Term Structure of Credit Risk Spreads|journal=Review of Financial Studies|volume=10|issue=2|year=1997|pages=481–523|issn=0893-9454|doi=10.1093/rfs/10.2.481}}&lt;/ref&gt; For corporate and commercial borrowers, these models generally have qualitative and quantitative sections outlining various aspects of the risk including, but not limited to, operating experience, management expertise, asset quality, and leverage and [[Accounting liquidity|liquidity ratios]], respectively. Once this information has been fully reviewed by credit officers and credit committees, the lender provides the funds subject to the terms and conditions presented within the contract (as outlined above).&lt;ref&gt;Altman, Edward I., and Anthony Saunders. "Credit risk measurement: Developments over the last 20 years." Journal of Banking &amp; Finance 21.11 (1997): 1721–1742.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mester, Loretta J. "What’s the point of credit scoring?." Business review 3 (1997): 3–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sovereign risk ===
[[Sovereign credit risk]] is the risk of a government being unwilling or unable to meet its loan obligations, or reneging on loans it guarantees. Many countries have faced sovereign risk in the [[late-2000s global recession]]. The existence of such risk means that creditors should take a two-stage decision process when deciding to lend to a firm based in a foreign country. Firstly one should consider the sovereign risk quality of the country and then consider the firm's credit quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cary L. Cooper |author2=Derek F. Channon | title = The Concise Blackwell Encyclopedia of Management | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-631-20911-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five macroeconomic variables that affect the probability of [[sovereign debt]] rescheduling are:&lt;ref name="sovrisk"&gt;{{cite book | author = Frenkel, Karmann and Scholtens| title = Sovereign Risk and Financial Crises| year = 2004 |publisher = Springer|isbn = 978-3-540-22248-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Debt service ratio]]
* [[Import ratio]]
* Investment ratio
* Variance of export revenue
* Domestic money supply growth

The probability of rescheduling is an increasing function of debt service ratio, import ratio, variance of export revenue and domestic money supply growth.&lt;ref name="sovrisk"/&gt; The likelihood of rescheduling is a decreasing function of investment ratio due to future economic productivity gains. Debt rescheduling likelihood can increase if the investment ratio rises as the foreign country could become less dependent on its external creditors and so be less concerned about receiving credit from these countries/investors.&lt;ref name="Saunders"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cornett, Marcia Millon  |author2=Saunders, Anthony | title = Financial Institutions Management: A [[Risk management|Risk Management]] Approach, 5th Edition | year = 2006 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | isbn = 978-0-07-304667-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Counterparty risk ===
A counterparty risk, also known as a [[default risk]], is a risk that a [[counterparty]] will not pay as obligated on a [[bond (finance)|bond]], [[derivative]], [[insurance policy]], or other contract.&lt;ref&gt;Investopedia. [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/counterpartyrisk.asp Counterparty risk]. Retrieved 2008-10-06&lt;/ref&gt; Financial institutions or other transaction counterparties may [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] or take out [[credit derivative|credit insurance]] or, particularly in the context of derivatives, require the posting of collateral. Offsetting counterparty risk is not always possible, e.g. because of temporary [[liquidity]] issues or longer term systemic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Henderson. [http://seekingalpha.com/article/58780-counterparty-risk-and-the-subprime-fiasco Counterparty Risk and the Subprime Fiasco]. 2008-01-02. Retrieved 2008-10-06&lt;/ref&gt;

Counterparty risk increases due to positively correlated risk factors. Accounting for correlation between portfolio risk factors and counterparty default in risk management methodology is not trivial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Brigo, Damiano   |author2=Andrea Pallavicini| title = Counterparty Risk under Correlation between Default and Interest Rates. In: Miller, J., Edelman, D., and Appleby, J. (Editors), Numerical Methods for Finance| year = 2007 |publisher = Chapman Hall|isbn = 1-58488-925-X}}[http://ssrn.com/abstract=926067 Related SSRN Research Paper]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mitigation ==
Lenders mitigate credit risk in a number of ways, including:

* '''Risk-based pricing''' – Lenders may charge a higher [[interest rate]] to borrowers who are more likely to default, a practice called '''[[risk-based pricing]]'''. Lenders consider factors relating to the loan such as [[loan purpose]], [[credit rating]], and [[loan-to-value ratio]] and estimates the effect on yield ([[credit spread (bond)|credit spread]]).
* '''Covenants''' – Lenders may write stipulations on the borrower, called '''[[loan covenant|covenants]]''', into loan agreements, such as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://moneyterms.co.uk/debt_covenants/ Debt covenants]&lt;/ref&gt;
** Periodically report its financial condition,
** Refrain from paying [[dividend]]s, [[share repurchase|repurchasing shares]], borrowing further, or other specific, voluntary actions that negatively affect the company's financial position, and
** Repay the loan in full, at the lender's request, in certain events such as changes in the borrower's [[debt-to-equity ratio]] or [[times interest earned|interest coverage ratio]].
* '''Credit insurance''' and '''credit derivatives''' – Lenders and [[bond (finance)|bond]] holders may [[Hedge (finance)#Hedging credit risk|hedge]] their credit risk by purchasing '''credit insurance''' or '''[[credit derivatives]]'''. These contracts transfer the risk from the lender to the seller (insurer) in exchange for payment. The most common credit derivative is the '''[[credit default swap]]'''.
* '''Tightening''' – Lenders can reduce credit risk by reducing the amount of credit extended, either in total or to certain borrowers. For example, a [[Distribution (business)|distributor]] selling its products to a troubled [[retailer]] may attempt to lessen credit risk by reducing payment terms from ''net 30 '' to ''net 15''.
* '''Diversification''' – Lenders to a small number of borrowers (or kinds of borrower) face a high degree of [[systematic risk#Unsystematic risk|unsystematic]] credit risk, called '''[[concentration risk]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/mba-mondays-diversification-2010-6 MBA Mondays:Risk Diversification]&lt;/ref&gt; Lenders reduce this risk by [[Diversification (finance)|diversifying]] the borrower pool.
* '''Deposit insurance''' – Governments may establish '''[[deposit insurance]]''' to guarantee bank deposits in the event of insolvency and to encourage consumers to hold their savings in the banking system instead of in cash.

The '''Defence of the Realm Act''' ('''DORA''') was passed in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] on 8 August 1914, four days after it entered [[World War I]] and was added to as the war progressed. It gave the [[Government of the United Kingdom|government]] wide-ranging powers during the war period, such as the power to [[Eminent domain|requisition]] buildings or land needed for the [[war effort]], or to make regulations creating criminal offences.

DORA ushered in a variety of authoritarian [[social control]] mechanisms, such as [[censorship]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;''"No person shall by word of mouth or in writing spread reports likely to cause disaffection or alarm among any of His Majesty's forces or among the civilian population"''&lt;ref&gt;Defence of the Realm (No. 2) Regulations, 1914, s. 4, at {{London Gazette |issue= 28887|date= 1 September 1914|pages=6968–6969 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Anti-war activists, including [[John Maclean (Scottish socialist)|John MacLean]], [[Willie Gallacher (politician)|Willie Gallacher]], [[John William Muir]], and [[Bertrand Russell]], were sent to prison.

The trivial peacetime activities no longer permitted included flying kites, starting bonfires, buying binoculars, feeding wild animals bread, discussing naval and military matters or buying alcohol on public transport. Alcoholic beverages were watered down and [[pub]] opening times were restricted to noon–3pm and 6:30pm–9:30pm (the requirement for an afternoon gap in permitted hours lasted in England until the [[Licensing Act 1988]] was brought into force).

== Intention ==
[[File:Postal censorship message 1916 IWM Documents.8252.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Example of censorship under the Act of comments about [[Zeppelin#During World War I|Zeppelin raids]] in mail&lt;/center&gt;]]
The law was designed to help prevent invasion and to keep morale at home high.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} It imposed censorship of journalism and of letters coming home from the front line. The press was subject to controls on reporting troop movements, numbers or any other operational information that could be exploited by the enemy. People who breached the regulations with intent to assist the enemy could be sentenced to death. 10 people were executed under the regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1940/may/22/treachery-bill Hansard, 22 May 1940]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though some provisions of DORA may seem strange, they did have their purposes. Flying a kite or lighting a bonfire could attract [[Zeppelin]]s and, after rationing was introduced in 1918, feeding wild animals was a waste of food.

== The original Act, its amendment, and consolidation ==
Section 1(1) of the Defence of the Realm Act read as follows:&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Times Documentary History of the War |year=1917 |publisher=''[[The Times]]'' |url=https://archive.org/details/timesdocumentary01londuoft |accessdate=13 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="National Archives"&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/firstworldwar/first_world_war/p_defence.htm Defence of the Realm Act], ''[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Don't ask, don't tell'''" ('''DADT''') was the official United States policy on [[Sexual orientation and the United States military|military service by gays, bisexuals, and lesbians]], instituted by the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]] on February 28, 1994, when [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] Directive 1304.26 issued on December 21, 1993, took effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Department of Defense Directive 1304.26 |url= http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blaw/dodd/corres/html2/d130426x.htm |accessdate= September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; lasting until September 20, 2011. The policy prohibited military personnel from discriminating against or harassing [[closeted]] [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] or [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] service members or applicants, while barring [[Coming out|openly gay]], [[lesbian]], or bisexual persons from military service. This relaxation of legal restrictions on service by gays and lesbians in the armed forces was mandated by United States federal law {{USPL|103|160}} ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|654}}), which was signed November 30, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Gays in the Military |url= http://guides.lib.washington.edu/content.php?pid=252734&amp;sid=2701216 |accessdate= September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy prohibited people who "demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts" from serving in the [[United States Armed Forces|armed forces of the United States]], because their presence "would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability".&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|10|654|b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act prohibited any homosexual or bisexual person from disclosing their [[sexual orientation]] or from speaking about any homosexual relationships, including marriages or other familial attributes, while serving in the United States armed forces. The act specified that service members who disclose that they are homosexual or engage in homosexual conduct should be separated (discharged) except when a service member's conduct was "for the purpose of avoiding or terminating military service" or when it "would not be in the best interest of the armed forces".&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|10|654(e)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since DADT ended in 2011, persons who are openly homosexual and bisexual have been able to serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Army Regulation 40-501, Standards of Medical Fitness, Chapters 2-27n and 3–35 |url= http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r40_501.pdf|accessdate= December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "don't ask" part of the DADT policy specified that superiors should not initiate investigation of a service member's orientation without witnessing disallowed behaviors, though credible evidence of homosexual behavior could be used to initiate an investigation. Unauthorized investigations and harassment of suspected servicemen and women led to an expansion of the policy to "don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue, don't harass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/d9/D9Legal/docs/05_2010MAYNewsletterDontAskDontTell.pdf |publisher=United States Coast Guard Ninth District Legal Office |title=''The Legal Brief'' "Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, Don’t Pursue, Don’t Harass: Reference (a): Personnel Manual, COMDTINST M1000.6, Ch. 12.E". |date=May 2010 |format=PDF |accessdate=October 23, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010|Legislation to repeal DADT]] was enacted in December 2010, specifying that the policy would remain in place until the [[President of the United States|President]], the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], and the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] certified that repeal would not harm military readiness, followed by a 60-day waiting period.&lt;ref name="Obama_Signed"&gt;{{cite news |author= Sheryl Gay Stolberg |title= Obama Signs Away 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= December 22, 2010 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/us/politics/23military.html |accessdate= December 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A July 6, 2011, ruling from a federal appeals court barred further enforcement of the U.S. military's ban on openly gay service members.&lt;ref name="Judged_Halts"&gt;{{cite news |agency= Associated Press |title= In reversal, federal court orders immediate end to 'don't ask, don’t tell' policy |newspaper= The Washington Post |date= July 6, 2011 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/in-reversal-federal-court-orders-immediate-end-to-dont-ask-dont-tell-policy/2011/07/06/gIQAAdux0H_story.html |accessdate= July 6, 2011 }} {{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Barack Obama]], Secretary of Defense [[Leon Panetta]], and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral [[Michael Mullen|Mike Mullen]] sent that certification to Congress on July 22, 2011, which set the end of DADT to September 20, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Obama certifies end of military's gay ban |agency= [[Reuters]] |publisher= [[NBC News]] |date= July 22, 2011 |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43859711/ns/us_news-life/ |accessdate= July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{further|Sexual orientation in the United States military}}
[[File:Dontaskdonttellcredible.jpg|thumb|310px|''Dignity and Respect'', the U.S. Army's 2001 training guide on the homosexual conduct policy, gave official guidelines on what can be considered credible information of someone's homosexuality.]]

Engaging in [[homosexual activity]] has been grounds for discharge from the American military since the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. Policies based on sexual orientation appeared as the United States prepared to enter [[World War II]]. When the military added psychiatric screening to its induction process, it included homosexuality as a disqualifying trait, then seen as a form of [[psychopathology]]. When the army issued revised mobilization regulations in 1942, it distinguished "homosexual" recruits from "normal" recruits for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Bérubé, ''Coming Out Under Fire'', 9–14, 19&lt;/ref&gt; Before the buildup to the war, gay service members were court-martialed, imprisoned, and dishonorably discharged; but in wartime, commanding officers found it difficult to convene court-martial boards of commissioned officers and the administrative [[blue discharge]] became the military's standard method for handling gay and lesbian personnel. In 1944, a new policy directive decreed that homosexuals were to be committed to military hospitals, examined by psychiatrists and discharged under Regulation 615-360, [[Section 8 (military)|section 8]].&lt;ref&gt;Bérubé, ''Coming Out Under Fire'', 142–3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, blue discharges were discontinued and two new classifications were created: "general" and "undesirable". Under such a system, a serviceman or woman found to be gay but who had not committed any sexual acts while in service would tend to receive an undesirable discharge. Those found guilty of engaging in sexual conduct were usually dishonorably discharged.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; A 1957 U.S. Navy study known as the [[Crittenden Report]] dismissed the charge that homosexuals constitute a security risk, but advocated stringent anti-homosexual policies because "Homosexuality is wrong, it is evil, and it is to be branded as such."&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Terry, ''An American Obsession: Science, Medicine, and Homosexuality in Modern Society'' (University of Chicago Press, 1999), 347&lt;/ref&gt; It remained secret until 1976.&lt;ref&gt;E. Lawrence Gibson, ''Get Off my Ship : Ensign Berg vs. the U.S. Navy'' (NY: Avon, 1978), 256–67&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fannie Mae Clackum]] was the first service member to successfully appeal such a discharge, winning eight years of back pay from the [[United States Court of Federal Claims|US Court of Claims]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth-Century America |publisher= Penguin |year= 1991 |place= New York |page= 155 |isbn= 978-0-14-017122-8 |author= [[Lillian Faderman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s through the Vietnam War, some notable gay service members avoided discharges despite pre-screening efforts, and when personnel shortages occurred, homosexuals were allowed to serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth-Century America |publisher= Penguin |year= 1991 |place= New York |pages = 119–138 |isbn= 978-0-14-017122-8 |author= [[Lillian Faderman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[LGBT social movements|gay and lesbian rights movement]] in the 1970s and 1980s raised the issue by publicizing several noteworthy dismissals of gay service members. Sgt. [[Leonard Matlovich]] appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;''TIME'': "[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917785,00.html  The Sexes: The Sergeant v. the Air Force]". September 8, 1975. Retrieved July 26, 2011. Other prominent cases included [[Vernon Berg, III|Copy Berg]], [[Stephen Donaldson (activist)|Stephen Donaldson]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 the Department of Defense issued a policy stating that, "Homosexuality is incompatible with military service." It cited the military's need "to maintain discipline, good order, and morale" and "to prevent breaches of security".&lt;ref&gt;Fordham University: [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/gao_report.asp "Homosexuals in the Armed Forces: United States GAO Report"], June 12, 1992. Retrieved February 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, in response to a campaign against lesbians at the Marines' [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island|Parris Island Depot]], activists launched the Gay and Lesbian Military Freedom Project (MFP) to advocate for an end to the exclusion of gays and lesbians from the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;Vaid, ''Virtual Equality'', 155-8&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, reports commissioned by the Personnel Security Research and Education Center (PERSEREC), an arm of the Pentagon, were discovered in the process of [[Joseph Steffan]]'s lawsuit fighting his forced resignation from the U.S. Naval Academy. One report said that "having a same-gender or an opposite-gender orientation is unrelated to [[job performance]] in the same way as is being left- or right-handed."&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Frank, ''Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America'' (NY: St. Martin's Press, 2009), 118–20; McFeeley, "Getting It Straight", 237-8&lt;/ref&gt; Other lawsuits fighting discharges highlighted the service record of service members like Tracey Thorne and [[Margarethe Cammermeyer|Margarethe (Grethe) Cammermeyer]]. The MFP began lobbying Congress in 1990, and in 1991 Senator [[Brock Adams]] (D-Washington) and Rep. [[Barbara Boxer]] introduced the Military Freedom Act, legislation to end the ban completely. Adams and Rep. [[Patricia Schroeder|Pat Schroeder]] (D-Colorado) re-introduced it the next year.&lt;ref&gt;McFeeley, "Getting It Straight", 238&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1991, Secretary of Defense [[Dick Cheney]], in the context of the outing of his press aide [[Pete Williams (journalist)|Pete Williams]], dismissed the idea that gays posed a security risk as "a bit of an old chestnut" in testimony before the House Budget Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen F. Hayes, ''Cheney: The Untold Story of America's Most Powerful and Controversial Vice President'' (NY: HarperCollins, 2007), 256&lt;/ref&gt; In response to his comment, several major newspapers endorsed ending the ban, including ''USA Today'', the ''Los Angeles Times'', and the ''Detroit Free Press''.&lt;ref&gt;Brian P. Mitchell, ''Women in the military: Flirting with Disaster'' (Washington: Regnery Publishing, 1998), 281&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1992, the General Accounting Office released a report that members of Congress had requested two years earlier estimating the costs associated with the ban on gays and lesbians in the military at $27 million annually.&lt;ref&gt;McFeeley, "Getting It Straight", 237; Vaid, ''Virtual Equality'', 158-9&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1992 U.S. presidential election]] campaign, the civil rights of gays and lesbians, particularly their open service in the military, attracted some press attention,&lt;ref&gt;Schmalz, Jeffrey (August 20, 1992).

[[Carl Epting Mundy, Jr.|Carl Mundy, Jr.]], Commandant of the Marine Corps, praised a position paper authored by a Marine Corps chaplain that said that "In the unique, intensely close environment of the military, homosexual conduct can threaten the lives, including the physical (e.g. AIDS) and psychological well-being of others". Mundy called it "extremely insightful" and said it offered "a sound basis for discussion of the issue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schmitt |first= Eric |title= Marine Corps Chaplain Says Homosexuals Threaten Military |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/26/us/marine-corps-chaplain-says-homosexuals-threaten-military.html |accessdate= January 23, 2013 |newspaper= New York Times |date= August 26, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murder of gay U.S. Navy petty officer [[Allen R.

==Origin==
The policy was introduced as a compromise measure in 1993 by President Bill Clinton who campaigned in 1992 on the promise to allow all citizens to serve in the military regardless of sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Shankar, Thom"&gt;{{cite news |author= Shankar, Thom |title= A New Push to Roll Back 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' |work= The New York Times |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/us/30military.html |accessdate= December 29, 2012 | date= November 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commander [[Craig Quigley]], a Navy spokesman, expressed the opposition of many in the military at the time when he said, "Homosexuals are notoriously promiscuous" and that in shared shower situations, heterosexuals would have an "uncomfortable feeling of someone watching".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/27/us/military-cites-wide-range-of-reasons-for-its-gay-ban.html |title= Military Cites Wide Range of Reasons for Its Gay Ban |accessdate= June 9, 2011 |work=The New York Times |date= January 27, 1993 |first=Eric |last=Schmitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1993 policy debate, the National Defense Research Institute prepared a study for the Office of the Secretary of Defense published as ''Sexual Orientation and U.S. Military Personnel Policy: Options and Assessment''. It concluded that "circumstances could exist under which the ban on homosexuals could be lifted with little or no adverse consequences for recruitment and retention" if the policy were implemented with care, principally because many factors contribute to individual enlistment and re-enlistment decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = National Defense Research Institute|author2=Rand Corporation Rand Corporation| title = Sexual orientation and U.S. military personnel policy: options and assessment| url = http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR323/| year = 1993| publisher = Rand| location = Santa Monica, Calif| isbn = 978-0-8330-1441-2| page = 406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 5, 1993, [[Gregory M. Herek]], associate research psychologist at the [[University of California at Davis]] and an authority on public attitudes toward lesbians and gay men, testified before the [[House Armed Services Committee]] on behalf of several professional associations. He stated, "The research data show that there is nothing about lesbians and gay men that makes them inherently unfit for military service, and there is nothing about heterosexuals that makes them inherently unable to work and live with gay people in close quarters." Herek added, "The assumption that heterosexuals cannot overcome their prejudices toward gay people is a mistaken one."&lt;ref&gt;Gregory M.

In Congress, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senator [[Sam Nunn]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] led the contingent that favored maintaining the absolute ban on gays. Reformers were led by Democratic Congressman [[Barney Frank]] of [[Massachusetts]], who favored modification (but ultimately voted for the defense authorization bill with the gay ban language), and [[Barry Goldwater]], a former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator and a retired Major General,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=US Air Force |title=Major General Barry M.

Congress rushed to enact the existing gay ban policy into federal law, outflanking Clinton's planned repeal effort. Clinton called for legislation to overturn the ban, but encountered intense opposition from the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], members of Congress, and portions of the public. DADT emerged as a compromise policy.&lt;ref name="Herek"&gt;{{cite web| url = Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S. Military: Historical Background | title = Don't Ask, Don't Tell Revisited | accessdate =June 3, 2010 | last = Herek | first = Gregory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress included text in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (passed in 1993) requiring the military to abide by regulations essentially identical to the 1982 absolute ban policy.&lt;ref name=stanforddont /&gt; The Clinton Administration on December 21, 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blaw/dodd/corres/html2/d130426x.htm |title=Defense Directive 1304.26: Qualification Standards for Enlistment, Appointment, and Induction |date=December 21, 1993 |publisher=Department of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt; issued Defense Directive 1304.26, which directed that military applicants were not to be asked about their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=stanforddont /&gt; This policy is now known as "Don't Ask, Don't Tell".

The "Don't Ask" provision mandated that military or appointed officials will not ask about or require members to reveal their sexual orientation. The "Don't Tell" stated that a member may be discharged for claiming to be a homosexual or bisexual or making a statement indicating a tendency towards or intent to engage in homosexual activities. The "Don’t Pursue" established what was minimally required for an investigation to be initiated. A "Don’t Harass" provision was added to the policy later. It ensured that the military would not allow harassment or violence against service members for any reason.&lt;ref name="Herek"/&gt;

The [[Servicemembers Legal Defense Network]] was founded in 1993 to advocate an end to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the U.S. Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/19/us/us-agencies-split-over-legal-tactics-on-gay-troop-plan.html Eric Schmitt, "U.S. Agencies Split over Legal Tactics on Gay Troop Plan"], December 19, 1993.

Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.]]'' (2006), unanimously held that the federal government could constitutionally withhold funding from universities, no matter what their nondiscrimination policies might be, for refusing to give military recruiters access to school resources. An association of law schools had argued that allowing military recruiting at their institutions compromised their ability to exercise their free speech rights in opposition to discrimination based on sexual orientation as represented by DADT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mears |first=Bill |year=2006 |title=Justices uphold military recruiting on campuses |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/03/06/scotus.recruiting/index.html |accessdate=March 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''McVeigh v. Cohen''===
In January 1998, Senior Chief Petty Officer Timothy R. McVeigh (not to be confused with convicted [[Oklahoma City bombing|Oklahoma City bomber]], [[Timothy McVeigh|Timothy J. McVeigh]]) won a preliminary injunction from a U.S. district court that prevented his discharge from the U.S. Navy for "homosexual conduct" after 17 years of service. His lawsuit did not challenge the DADT policy, but asked the court to hold the military accountable for adhering to the policy's particulars. The Navy had investigated McVeigh's sexual orientation based on his [[AOL]] email account name and user profile. District Judge [[Stanley Sporkin]] ruled in ''[[McVeigh v. Cohen]]'' that the Navy had violated its own DADT guidelines: "Suggestions of sexual orientation in a private, anonymous email account did not give the Navy a sufficient reason to investigate to determine whether to commence discharge proceedings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetlibrary.com/pdf/McVeigh-Cohen-DDC.pdf|title=Memorandum Opinion, ''Timothy R.

The case also attracted attention because a navy paralegal had misrepresented himself when querying AOL for information about McVeigh's account. [[Frank Rich]] linked the two issues: "McVeigh is as clear-cut a victim of a witch hunt as could be imagined, and that witch hunt could expand exponentially if the military wants to add on-line fishing to its invasion of service members' privacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Frank|last=Rich|date=January 17, 1998|title=The 2 Tim McVeighs|work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/17/opinion/journal-the-2-tim-mcveighs.html |accessdate=September 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; AOL apologized to McVeigh and paid him damages. McVeigh reached a settlement with the Navy that paid his legal expenses and allowed him to retire with full benefits in July. ''[[The New York Times]]'' called Sporkin's ruling "a victory for gay rights, with implications for the millions of people who use computer on-line services".&lt;ref name=nyt19980612&gt;{{cite news |last1= Shenon |first1=Philip |title= Sailor Victorious in Gay Case of On-Line Privacy |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/12/us/sailor-victorious-in-gay-case-of-on-line-privacy.html |accessdate= September 21, 2014 |work= New York Times |date= June 12, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Witt v. Department of the Air Force''===
In April 2006, Margaret Witt, a major in the [[United States Air Force]] who was being investigated for homosexuality, filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Washington]] seeking [[Declaratory relief|declaratory]] and [[Injunction|injunctive relief]] on the grounds that DADT violates substantive [[due process]], the Equal Protection Clause, and procedural due process. In July 2007 the [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]] ordered her honorable discharge. Dismissed by the district court, the case was heard on appeal, and the Ninth Circuit issued its ruling on May 21, 2008. Its decision in ''[[Witt v. Department of the Air Force]]'' reinstated Witt's substantive-due-process and procedural-due-process claims and affirmed the dismissal of her Equal Protection claim. The Ninth Circuit, analyzing the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003), determined that DADT had to be subjected to heightened scrutiny, meaning that there must be an "important" governmental interest at issue, that DADT must "significantly" further the governmental interest, and that there can be no less intrusive way for the government to advance that interest.

The [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] declined to appeal, allowing a May 3, 2009, deadline to pass, leaving ''Witt'' as binding on the entire Ninth Circuit, and returning the case to the District Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Bravin |first= Jess |author2= Laura Meckler |title= Obama Avoids Test on Gays in Military |work= [[The Wall Street Journal]] |date= May 19, 2009 |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124268952606832391 |accessdate= July 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 24, 2010, District Judge [[Ronald B.

District Court neither anticipated questions of
constitutional law nor formulated a rule broader than is required by the facts. The
constitutional issues regarding DADT are well-defined, and the District Court
focused specifically on the relevant inquiry of whether the statute impermissibly
infringed upon substantive due process rights with regard to a protected area of
individual liberty. Engaging in a careful and detailed review of the facts presented
to it at trial, the District Court properly concluded that the Government put forward
no persuasive evidence to demonstrate that the statute is a valid exercise of
congressional authority to legislate in the realm of protected liberty interests. See
Log Cabin, 716 F. Supp. 2d at 923. Hypothetical questions were neither presented
nor answered in reaching this decision.

Following passage of the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]], the Justice Department asked the Ninth Circuit to suspend LCR's suit in light of the legislative repeal.

==Repeal==
The underlying justifications for DADT have been subjected to increasing suspicion and outright rejection by the early 21st century. Mounting evidence obtained from the integration efforts of foreign militaries, surveys of U.S. military personnel, and studies conducted by the DoD&amp;nbsp;gave credence to the view that the presence of open homosexuals within the military would not be detrimental at all to the armed forces. A DoD study conducted at the behest of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in 2010 supports this most.

The DoD working group conducting the study considered the impact that lifting the ban would have on unit cohesion and effectiveness, good order and discipline, and military morale. The study included a survey that revealed significant differences between respondents who believed they had served with homosexual troops and those who did not believe they had.In analyzing such data, the DoD working group concluded that it was actually generalized perceptions of homosexual troops that led to the perceived unrest that would occur without DADT. Ultimately, the study deemed the overall risk to military effectiveness of lifting the ban to be low. Citing the ability of the armed forces to adjust to the previous integration of African-Americans and women, the DoD study asserted that the United States military could adjust as had it before in history without an impending serious effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.law.georgetown.edu/academics/law-journals/gjlpp/upload/zs800112000015.pdf|title = The Effects of Repealing Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell: Is the Combat Exclusion the Next Casualty in the March Toward Integration?|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Crandall|first = Carla}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The repeal act established a process for ending the DADT policy.

Once certification was given, DADT would be lifted after a 60-day waiting period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.4023: Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a December 2010 ''[[The Washington Post]]''-[[ABC News]] poll 77% of Americans said gays and lesbians who publicly disclose their sexual orientation should be able to serve in the military. That number showed little change from polls over the previous two years, but represented the highest level of support in a Post-ABC poll. The support also cut across partisan and ideological lines, with majorities of Democrats (86%), Republicans (74%), independents (74%), liberals (92%), conservatives (67%), white evangelical Protestants (70%) and non-religious (84%) in favor of homosexuals serving openly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Keefe |first=Ed |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/federal-eye/2010/12/most_back_repealing_dont_ask_d.html |title=Most back repealing 'don't ask, don't tell,' poll says |work=The Washington Post |date=December 15, 2010 |accessdate=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A November 2010 survey by the [[Pew Research Center]] found that 58% of the U.S. public favored allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military, while less than half as many (27%) were opposed.&lt;ref&gt;Pew Research Center: [http://people-press.org/report/679/ "Most Continue to Favor Gays Serving Openly in Military", Nov 29, 2010]. Retrieved February 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a November 2010 [[CNN]]/[[Opinion Research Corporation]] poll, 72% of adult Americans favored permitting people who are openly gay or lesbian to serve in the military, while 23% opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/images/11/17/rel16e.pdf |title=CNN Opinion Research November 11–14, 2010 |format=PDF |accessdate=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The main difference between the CNN poll and the Pew poll is in the number of respondents who told pollsters that they didn't have an opinion on this topic – 16 percent in the Pew poll compared to only five percent in the CNN survey", said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. "The two polls report virtually the same number who say they oppose gays serving openly in the military, which suggests that there are some people who favor that change in policy but for some reason were reluctant to admit that to the Pew interviewers. That happens occasionally on topics where moral issues and equal-treatment issues intersect."&lt;ref&gt;Steinhauser, Paul (November 29, 2010).

A February 2010 [[Quinnipiac University Polling Institute]] national poll showed 57% of American voters favored gays serving openly, compared to 36% opposed, while 66% said not allowing openly gay personnel to serve is discrimination, compared to 31% who did not see it as discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Quinnipiac University: [https://archive.is/20120805133053/http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1284.xml?ReleaseID=1422&amp; "U.S. Voters Say Gays In Military Should Come Out, Quinnipiac University National Poll Finds"], February 10, 2010. Retrieved February 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[CBS News]]/''[[The New York Times]]'' national poll done at the same time showed 58% of Americans favored gays serving openly, compared to 28% opposed.&lt;ref&gt;CBS News: [http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/poll_021110_2pm.pdf "Gays in the military"], February 11, 2010.

===Chaplains and religious groups===
Chaplain groups and religious organizations took various positions on DADT. Some felt that the policy needed to be withdrawn to make the military more inclusive. The Southern Baptist Convention battled the repeal of DADT, warning that their endorsements for chaplains might be withdrawn if the repeal took place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zimbio.com/Gay+and+Lesbian+Rights/articles/wZNA33qCpho/Baptists+Catholics+Threaten+Withdraw+Chaplains "Baptists, Catholics Threaten to Withdraw Chaplains Over DADT", November 1, 2010]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011195552/http://www.zimbio.com/Gay%2Band%2BLesbian%2BRights/articles/wZNA33qCpho/Baptists%2BCatholics%2BThreaten%2BWithdraw%2BChaplains |date=October 11, 2012 }}.

The Roman Catholic Church called for the retention of the policy, but had no plans to withdraw its priests from serving as military chaplains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/18/AR2010061804890.html |title=Southern Baptists Convention fighting 'don't ask, don't tell' repeal |work=The Washington Post |date= June 18, 2010|accessdate=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty-five retired chaplains signed a letter opposing repeal, stating that repeal would make it impossible for chaplains whose faith teaches that same-sex behavior is immoral to minister to military service members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/oct/31/retired-chaplains-back-dont-ask/ "Retired chaplains back 'don't ask'"], ''Washington Times'' October 31, 2010. Retrieved February 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Other religious organizations and agencies called the repeal of the policy a "non-event" or "non-issue" for chaplains, claiming that chaplains have always supported military service personnel, whether or not they agree with all their actions or beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrcbackstory.org/2010/04/religious-organizations-support-%E2%80%9Cdon%E2%80%99t-ask-don%E2%80%99t-tell%E2%80%9D-repeal |title=HRC Back Story, April 28, 2010 |publisher=Hrcbackstory.org |date=April 28, 2010 |accessdate=October 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019042618/http://www.hrcbackstory.org/2010/04/religious-organizations-support-%E2%80%9Cdon%E2%80%99t-ask-don%E2%80%99t-tell%E2%80%9D-repeal/ |archivedate=October 19, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sldn.org/blog/archives/bishop-robinsons-letter-exposes-empty-arguments-of-repeal-opponents |title=Servicemembers Legal Defense Network |publisher=Sldn.org |date=August 4, 2010 |accessdate=October 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010012335/http://www.sldn.org/blog/archives/bishop-robinsons-letter-exposes-empty-arguments-of-repeal-opponents/ |archivedate=October 10, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Resnicoff |first=Arnold E. |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/2010-07-12-column12_ST_N.htm |title=If gays serve openly, will chaplains suffer?

==Discharges under DADT==
After the policy was introduced in 1993, the military discharged over 13,000 troops from the military under DADT.&lt;ref name="MSN-MilitaryView"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ObamaEnd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=60043|title=Stars and Stripes: Obama Wants to End "Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell" |last=Shane|first=Leo|date=January 16, 2009|work=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Defense]]|accessdate=January 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2009/05/20/continued_discharges_anger_dont_ask_dont_tell_critics/ Continued discharges anger 'don't ask, don't tell' critics: Gay-rights groups urge reversal now] Bryan Bender, ''Boston Globe''; May 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of discharges per fiscal year under DADT dropped sharply after the [[September 11 attacks]] and remained comparatively low through to the repeal. Discharges exceeded 600 every year until 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2995">The '''Edict of Boulogne''', also called the '''Edict of Pacification of Boulogne''' and the '''Peace of La Rochelle''', was signed in July, 1573 &lt;ref&gt;Jouanna, p. 213.  The Catholic Encyclopedia gives 25 June 1573 as the date of signing.&lt;/ref&gt; by King [[Charles IX of France]] in the [[Château de Madrid]] in the [[Bois de Boulogne]].  It was officially registered by the [[Parlement]] of Paris on 11 August 1573.&lt;ref&gt;Jouanna, p.213.  Note: In the chronology section, Jouanna also gives 11 July (p.1391) as the date of Parlement's registration.&lt;/ref&gt;  The treaty officially ended the fourth phase of the [[French Wars of Religion]] (set off by the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] in August 1572; this phase of the wars included the [[siege of La Rochelle (1572-1573)]] and the [[Siege of Sancerre]]).

==Content==
The treaty severely curtailed many of the rights granted to the French Protestants in the previous [[Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. Based on the terms of the treaty, all Huguenots were granted amnesty for their past actions and the freedom of belief. However, they were permitted the freedom to worship only within the three towns of [[La Rochelle]], [[Montauban]], and [[Nîmes]], and there only privately within their own residences; Protestant nobles with the right of high-justice were permitted to celebrate marriages and baptisms, but only before an assembly limited to ten persons outside of their family.&lt;ref&gt;Jouanna, p.213.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the three mentioned cities, Protestantism worship was forbidden completely.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=En23VTbYwhQC&amp;pg=PA97 ''The French wars of religion, 1562-1629'' by Mack P. Holt p.97]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Procession de la Ligue 1590 Carnavalet.jpg|thumb|The [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] obtained the cancellation of the Peace of La Rochelle. Armed procession of the League in Paris in 1590, [[Musée Carnavalet]].]]
Due to pressure from the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]], [[Henry III of France]] had to cancel the Peace of La Rochelle, re-criminalizing Protestantism and beginning a new chapter in the [[French Wars of Religion]], which did not conclude until [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] issued the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1598.

==Background==
Zain was hired as a chemist in the West Virginia state crime lab in 1977,&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt; with the rank of [[trooper (police rank)|trooper]] in the [[West Virginia State Police]], which ran the lab. He eventually rose to director of the [[serology]] department in the state Department of Public Safety–the official name of the State Police until 1995.&lt;ref name=SupremeCourt&gt;[http://truthinjustice.org/zainreport.htm West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals ruling on Zain case]  November 4, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was later established that Zain had gained his position in the serology department on false credentials. He claimed to have graduated from West Virginia State College (now [[West Virginia State University]]) with a major in biology and a minor in chemistry. He had indeed majored in biology, but had graduated with a C average. He had never minored in chemistry, but had taken a few chemistry courses, all of which he either flunked or barely passed. He had also flunked an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] course in forensic science. Nonetheless, no one checked his background.&lt;ref name=APChan&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-08-21/news/mn-29449_1_lab-tests-fred-zain-double-murder|title=Scores of Convictions Reviewed as Chemist Faces Perjury Accusations :  Forensics: Fred Zain's expert testimony and lab tests helped put scores of rapists and murderers behind bars.

He is also accused of evidence-tampering.|author=Chan, Sau|date=August 21, 1994|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HuntingtonNews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.huntingtonnews.net/local/101025-rutherford-localmallrapist.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908151432/http://archives.huntingtonnews.net/local/101025-rutherford-localmallrapist.html|title=Former News Anchor Recalls ‘Mall Rapist’ Saga|author=Rutherford, Tony|date=October 25, 2010 |archivedate=September 8, 2015|publisher=Huntington News Network|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on, Zain gained a reputation for being able to solve extremely difficult cases, and was looked on as a "god" by West Virginia [[prosecuting attorney]]s.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;  His reputation was such that prosecutors throughout the country wanted to use him as an expert witness.&lt;ref name=HuntingtonNews/&gt;

There were problems on the horizon, but Zain's supervisors chose to ignore them.  In 1985, [[FBI Laboratory]] director James Greer told the state police that Zain had failed basic courses in serology and testing bloodstains.  No corrective action was taken.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;  Later that year, two workers claimed to have seen Zain record results from blank test plates.  However, these complaints were not taken seriously because it was well known the workers and Zain didn't get along well.&lt;ref name=APChan/&gt;  Zain also gained a reputation for being very "pro-prosecution."&lt;ref name=SupremeCourt/&gt;

In 1989, Zain became chief of physical evidence at the Bexar County [[medical examiner]]'s office.  However, West Virginia prosecutors continued to call upon him because his results appeared to be more favorable than others.&lt;ref name=APChan/&gt;

==West Virginia work discredited==
In 1987, [[Glen Woodall]] was convicted of a series of grisly felonies at [[Huntington Mall]], including two cases of [[sexual assault]], principally on Zain's testimony regarding [[semen]] from one of the victims.  Woodall was sentenced to 335 years in prison. However, in 1988, [[DNA]] testing—the first ever admitted as evidence at the state level in the United States—proved conclusively that Woodall was innocent, and the conviction was thrown out. Woodall's defense team conducted its own tests, which determined that Zain had used flawed [[Blood type|blood-typing]] methods in tying the semen to Woodall. More seriously, it appeared that Zain had initially determined a piece of hair was unidentifiable pubic hair, but later changed his identification to hair from Woodall's beard.&lt;ref name=HuntingtonNews/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/12/us/court-invalidates-a-decade-of-blood-test-results-in-criminal-cases.html Court Invalidates a Decade of Blood Test Results in Criminal Cases]. [[New York Times]], 1993-11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;  On that basis, Woodall was freed in 1992. Woodall subsequently sued the state for [[false imprisonment]] and won a $1 million settlement.&lt;ref name=SupremeCourt/&gt;

At the request of the state police, [[Kanawha County]] Prosecutor William Forbes began a criminal investigation.  Forbes was so disturbed by what he found that he asked the [[Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia]] to appoint a special judge and a panel of lawyers and scientists to investigate the serology department.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;  On November 4, 1993, Senior [[Circuit Court]] Judge James Holliday issued a report finding that Zain had engaged in a staggering litany of misconduct and outright fraud. According to the report, Zain had misstated evidence, falsified lab results and reported scientifically implausible results that may have resulted in as many as 134 people being wrongfully convicted. Holliday found that Zain's misconduct was so egregious that any testimony offered by Zain should be presumed as ''prima facie'' "invalid, unreliable, and inadmissible."  It also found serious deficiencies in the serology division's quality-control procedures.  The Supreme Court unanimously accepted Holliday's report on November 12, calling Zain's actions "egregious violations of the right of a defendant to a fair trial" and a "corruption of our legal system."&lt;ref name=SupremeCourt/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt; 

==Further investigation==
An investigation in Texas found that while working with the Bexar County medical examiner's office, Zain had engaged in misconduct and fraud that may have resulted in as many as 180 wrongful convictions.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William J. Tilstone|author2=Kathleen A. Savage|author3=Leigh A. Clark|title=Forensic Science: An Encyclopedia of History, Methods, and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIRQOssWbaoC|year=2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-194-6|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in West Virginia, the Texas investigation found numerous instances of Zain filing reports on tests that had never even been done, reporting negative results as positive, and describing inconclusive results as conclusive.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt; Bexar County fired him after his misconduct in West Virginia came to light.  Reviews over the cases he presided led to dropped charges and overturned convictions in multiple cases in West Virginia and Texas. West Virginia alone ended up paying out a combined total of $6.5 million to settle lawsuits by people who had been wrongfully convicted due to Zain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.herald-dispatch.com/news/recent_news/who-was-fred-zain/article_f11fed0a-8946-5552-88df-f8d5086b0af4.html|title=Who was Fred Zain?|author=|date=October 23, 2010|work=The Herald-Dispatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Zain was charged with fraud, but his trial was put on indefinite hold after he was diagnosed with liver cancer. In 2001, he was charged on four counts of obtaining money under false pretenses, but the jury deadlocked. A new fraud trial was later scheduled for July 2003. In December 2002, Zain succumbed to his liver cancer and died in his home in [[Ormond Beach, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.texnews.com/1998/2002/texas/texas_Former_St123.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413140646/http://www.texnews.com/1998/2002/texas/texas_Former_St123.html|title=Former State Police chemist Fred Zain dies|date=December 3, 2002|archivedate=April 13, 2014|publisher=Texas News|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2484">In [[economics]], '''hoarding''' is the practice of obtaining and holding [[resource]]s in quantities greater than needed for one's immediate use.

==Artificial scarcity==
The term "hoarding" may include the practice of obtaining and holding resources to create [[artificial scarcity]], thus reducing the [[supply (economics)|supply]], to [[supply and demand|increase the price]], so that they can be sold to customers for [[profit (accounting)|profit]].

==Fear-based hoarding==
Hoarding behavior is a common response to fear, whether fear of imminent societal collapse or a simple fear of a shortage of some good. Civil unrest or natural disasters may lead people to collect foodstuffs, water, gasoline, generators, and other essentials which they believe, rightly or wrongly, may soon be in short supply. There is often an implication that hoarding occurs because individuals do not believe that the market will operate efficiently in current or expected conditions. See [[prepper]]s.

==Example==
A feature of hoarding is that it leads to an inefficient distribution of scarce resources, making the scarcity even more of a problem. An example occurs in cities where parking is inadequate. In such a case, businesses may post signs indicating that their lot is for their employees and customers only, and all other vehicles will be towed. This prevents businesses from allowing their parking to overflow into neighboring lots when their capacity is exceeded. Thus, when the capacity is reached at one business, there may be no legal place to park, while there would have been, if hoarding had not occurred. If a single business posted those signs, it would, indeed, improve the parking situation at that business, as they could continue to park at adjacent businesses, while the others could not park in their lot. However, when everybody posts such signs, the problem becomes worse for everyone. (This example assumes all of the lots are sometimes inadequate for their businesses; in a case where a business has sufficient parking for itself, but its lot is filled with customers from others, the signs would be beneficial to that business, even if others did the same.)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/law/students/publications/clr/pdfs/keith_sharfman.pdf The Law and Economics of Hoarding&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Indiana v. Edwards''''', 554 U.S. 164 (2008), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that the standard for competency to stand trial was not linked to the standard for competency to represent oneself.  

==Background==
===Prior jurisprudence===
The Court had recognized these two rights on competency for some time.  In ''[[Dusky v. United States]]'', {{ussc|362|402|1960}}, and in ''[[Drope v. Missouri]]'', {{ussc|420|162|1975}}, the Court established the standard for competency to stand trial&amp;mdash;the defendant must have a "rational and factual understanding" of the nature of the proceedings, and must be able to rationally assist his lawyer in defending him.  In ''[[Faretta v. California]]'', {{ussc|422|806|1975}}, the Court held that a criminal defendant cannot be forced to have a lawyer if he does not wish it, but that before the defendant relinquishes his right to counsel the trial judge must ensure that the defendant understands the "dangers and disadvantages" of representing himself. With the decision in ''[[Godinez v. Moran]]'', {{ussc|509|389|1993}}, the Court held that a defendant may plead guilty (and thereby waive both his right to counsel and his right to represent himself) if he is competent to stand trial.  Until ''Edwards'', however, it remained an open question whether a criminal defendant could be simultaneously competent to stand trial and yet not competent to represent himself.  The Court answered that question in the affirmative.  The logic is that representing oneself at trial is more complicated than deciding what to plead.

===Edwards' trial===
Ahmad Edwards, who suffers from [[schizophrenia]], tried to steal a pair of shoes from a department store in Indiana.  Store detectives caught him in the act, and he drew a gun, fired at a store security officer, and wounded an innocent bystander.  He was charged with attempted murder, battery with a deadly weapon, criminal recklessness, and theft.

In 2000, he was deemed not competent to stand trial, and ordered to the state hospital for treatment.  After seven months of treatment, he was restored to competency.  Yet in 2002, his lawyers asked for another competency evaluation.  That second competency evaluation resulted in a determination that Edwards was indeed competent to stand trial, although he still suffered from a mental illness.  As trial preparations proceeded, his lawyers asked for a third competency evaluation, and in 2003 Edwards was again found not competent to stand trial and again committed to the state hospital.  Eight months later, Edwards was again restored to competence, and trial preparations began again.

In June 2005, as trial began, Edwards asked to represent himself and asked for a continuance in the trial.  The judge denied the request for a continuance, and Edwards therefore proceeded to trial with counsel.  He was convicted of criminal recklessness and theft, but the jury could not reach a verdict as to the attempted murder and battery charges.  Before the second trial on the attempted murder and battery charges, Edwards again asked to represent himself.  The judge denied that request, pointing to the lengthy record of Edwards's mental illness.  Edwards proceeded to trial with appointed counsel, and was convicted of the attempted murder and battery charges.

===Appeals===
Edwards appealed to the [[Indiana Court of Appeals]], arguing that his right to [[Faretta v. California|represent himself]] at trial was violated.  The court agreed with Edwards and ordered a new trial.  The State then appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Indiana|Indiana Supreme Court]], which also agreed with Edwards.  It reasoned that ''Faretta'' and ''Moran'' required the state to allow Edwards to represent himself at trial.  The State of Indiana asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision, and it agreed to do so.

==Opinion of the Court==
As [[Stephen Breyer|Justice Breyer]] noted in his majority opinion for the Court, the Court's competency and self-representation cases "frame the question presented, but they do not answer it."  A defendant who has a rational and factual understanding of the proceedings and who can rationally assist trial counsel is competent to stand trial.  And a defendant who voluntarily and intelligently elects to stand trial without counsel&amp;mdash;something he can only do if he is competent to stand trial to begin with&amp;mdash;may do so.  Even so, the right of self-representation is [[McKaskle v. Wiggins|not absolute]], and standby counsel may be appointed to assist the ''pro se'' defendant in matters of procedure and courtroom decorum.  The Court came closest to answering the question presented by this case when it held that the standard for competency to stand trial and competency to plead guilty are the same, because the decision not to stand trial is "no more complicated than the sum total of decisions that a [represented] defendant may be called upon to make during the course of a trial." The crucial difference in ''Edwards'', was that the ''pro se'' defendant ''was'' asking to proceed to trial without counsel.  The difference, in other words, is the difference between the ability to end trial proceedings on one's own and the ability to conduct trial proceedings on one's own.

The Court ultimately concluded that, in light of these rules, a state may require an otherwise competent criminal defendant to proceed to trial with the assistance of counsel.  The standard for competency to stand trial presumes that the defendant will have a lawyer to assist him at that trial.  Implicit therefore in the ''Dusky'' rule is the idea that the standard for competency to stand trial must be lower than the standard for competency to represent oneself.  The right to represent oneself at trial is qualified by the trial court's interest in preserving courtroom decorum and promoting the orderly presentation of evidence, questioning of witnesses, and advancement of legal argument.  For the Court, it was "common sense" that a defendant's mental illness might impair his ability to accomplish these tasks&amp;mdash;tasks that any lawyer must if he is to press his client's case effectively.  "A right of self-representation at trial will not affirm the dignity of a defendant who lacks the mental capacity to conduct his defense without the assistance of counsel."  

Moreover, the Court separated the standards for competency to stand trial and for competency to represent oneself out of a concern for the fairness of the trial process.  Criminal trials "must not only be fair, they must appear fair to all who observe them."  "No trial can be fair that leaves the defense to a man who is insane, unaided by counsel, and who by reason of his mental condition stands hopeless and alone before the court."  For these reasons, the Constitution allows trial courts to "take realistic account of the particular defendant's mental capacities by asking whether a defendant who seeks to conduct his own defense at trial is mentally competent to do so."

===Dissenting opinion===
Characterizing the right of self-representation as "a specific right long understood as essential to a fair trial,"  [[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]] disputed the Court's conclusion that "a State may... strip a mentally ill defendant of the right to represent himself when that would be fairer."  Because counsel's role under the Sixth Amendment is merely one of "assistance," or because the "right of self-representation could also be seen as a part of the traditional meaning of the Due Process Clause," ''Faretta'' had held that a state may not force a lawyer upon a defendant who does not want one.  ''Faretta'' required the trial judge to inform Edwards about the dangers and disadvantages of representing himself, and Scalia believed that Edwards had taken that warning to heart.  For Scalia, ultimately the right of self-representation rests on the right to present one's ''own'' case to the jury, however foolhardy an endeavor that might be.

Scalia also rejected the "dignity" premise that supported the Court's decision.  "While there is little doubt that preserving individual dignity (to which the Court refers) is paramount," he wrote, "there is equally little doubt that the loss of dignity the right [of self-representation] is designed to prevent is not the defendant's making a fool of himself by presenting an amateurish or even incoherent defense.  Rather, the dignity at issue is the supreme human dignity of being master of one's fate rather than a ward of the State&amp;mdash;the dignity of individual choice."  Scalia necessarily overlooks the possibility that a mental illness could impair a person's ability to rationally make a dignified individual choice whether or not to have representation and as to the proper defense while at the same time ''not'' impair his ability to understand the nature of the proceedings of which he is at the center and rationally assist his representation, as required under ''Dusky''.  ''Godinez'' had found that the competency standard for pleading guilty or waiving one's right to counsel was the same as the standard for standing trial; therefore in Scalia's view if Edwards had the right to ''waive'' his defense completely he surely had the lesser right to mount a (presumably inferior) ''[[pro se]]'' defense.

Finally, consistent with his originalist theory, Scalia sought to quell doubts regarding the authenticity of the right of self-representation.  "The right is not explicitly set forth in the text of the Sixth Amendment, and some Members of this Court [including Justice Breyer] have expressed skepticism about ''Faretta'''s holding."  But, Scalia pointed out, the Sixth Amendment gave the defendant personally, and not his lawyer, the right to call witnesses on his behalf, the right to confront the prosecution's witnesses against him, and to have counsel assist him (assuming he so wishes).  If the defendant is bound by counsel's decisions not to call certain witnesses or not to cross-examine others, he must have the right to represent himself in order to give substance to those other rights the Sixth Amendment protects.  "Otherwise, the defense presented is not the defense guaranteed him by the Constitution, for in a very real sense, it is not ''his'' defense."

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Industrial property''' is one of two subsets of [[intellectual property]] (the other being [[copyright]]) takes a range of forms, including [[patent]]s for [[invention]]s, [[industrial design]]s (aesthetic creations related to the appearance of industrial products), [[trademark]]s, [[service mark]]s, layout-designs of [[integrated circuit]]s, [[commercial name]]s and designations, [[geographical indication]]s and protection against [[unfair competition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/36/intellectual-industrial-and-commercial-property|title=Intellectual, industrial and commercial property {{!}} Fact Sheets on the European Union {{!}} European Parliament|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, aspects of an intellectual creation, although present, are less clearly defined. The object of industrial property consists of signs conveying information, in particular to consumers, regarding products and services offered on the market. Protection is directed against unauthorized use of such signs that could mislead consumers, and against misleading practices in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_909_2016.pdf|title=Understanding Copyright and Related Rights|last=|first=|publisher=WIPO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-805-2799-5|location=|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The broad application of the term “industrial property” is set out in the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention,]] Industrial property legislation is part of the wider body of law known as [[intellectual property]] (IP) which refers broadly to the creations of the human mind. IP rights protect the interests of innovators and creators by giving them rights over their creations. The [[Convention establishing the world intellectual property organization|Convention Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization]] (1967) does not seek to define [[Intellectual Property Rights|intellectual property]], but lists the following as protected by IP [[Intellectual Property Rights|rights]]:[[Literature|literary]], [[art]]istic and [[scientific works]]; [[performance]]s of [[Performing arts|performing artists]], phonograms and broadcasts; inventions in all fields of human endeavor; scientific discoveries; industrial designs; trademarks, service marks, and commercial names and designations; protection against unfair competition; “''all other rights resulting from intellectual activity in the industrial, scientific, literary or artistic fields''”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_895_2016.pdf|title=Understanding Industrial Property|last=|first=|publisher=WIPO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-805-2588-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries generally have laws to protect IP for two main reasons:
# To  give  statutory  expression  to  the rights  of  creators  and  innovators  in their  creations  and  innovations,  balanced  against  the  public  interest  in accessing creations and innovations;
# To  promote  creativity  and  innovation, so contributing to economic and social development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
The importance of protecting Industrial property was first recognized in the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]] in 1883 and the [[Berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works|Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] in 1886. Both treaties are administered by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Patents for Invention ==
{{Main|Patent}}
[[Patent]]s, also referred to as patents for invention, are the most widespread means of protecting technical inventions. The patent system is designed to contribute to the promotion of [[innovation]] and the transfer and dissemination of [[technology]], to the mutual advantage of inventors, users of inventions and the [[general public]]. Once a patent is granted by a state or by a regional office acting for several states, the owner of a patent has the right to prevent anyone else from commercially exploiting the invention for a limited period, generally 20 years. The patent applicant must disclose the invention in order to obtain protection, and their rights can be enforced only within the territory in which the patent was granted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Definitions ===
Most laws dealing with the protection of [[invention]]s do not actually define what an invention is. A number of countries, however, define inventions as new solutions to technical problems. The problem may be old or new, but the solution, in order to be considered an invention, must be a new one. Merely discovering something that already exists in [[nature]] will not generally qualify as an invention; an adequate amount of human [[ingenuity]], [[creativity]] and inventiveness must be involved. But an invention need not be technically complex: the [[safety pin]] was an invention that solved a “technical” problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Exclusive rights ===
By granting an exclusive right, patents provide incentives, offering inventors recognition for their creativity and material reward for their marketable inventions. These incentives encourage innovation, which in turn contributes to continued enhancement of the quality of life. In return for the exclusive right, the inventor must adequately disclose the patented invention to the public, so that others have access to the new knowledge, leading to further innovation. The disclosure of the invention is thus an essential consideration in any patent granting procedure. The word “patent”, or “letters patent”, also denotes the document issued by the relevant government authority. In order to obtain a patent for an invention, the inventor, or often the inventor’s employer, submits an application to the national or regional patent office concerned. In the application, the applicant must describe the invention in detail and compare it with previous existing technologies in the same field in order to demonstrate that it is new.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Patentability ===
Not all inventions are patentable. Patent laws generally require that an invention fulfill the following conditions, known as the requirements or conditions of patentability:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* '''Patentable subject matter:''' The invention must fall within the scope of patentable subject matter as defined by national law. This varies from one country to another. Many countries exclude from patentability such subject matter as scientific theories, mathematical methods, plant or animal varieties, discoveries of natural substances, methods for medical treatment (as opposed to medical products), and any invention where prevention of commercial exploitation is necessary to protect public order, morality or public health.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Industrial applicability (utility):''' The invention must be of practical use, or capable of some kind of industrial application.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Novelty:''' The invention must show some new characteristic that is not known in the body of existing knowledge (referred to as prior art) in its technical field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Inventive step (non-obviousness):''' The invention must show an inventive step that could not be deduced by a person with average knowledge of the technical field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Disclosure of the invention:''' The invention must be disclosed in a clear and complete manner in the patent application to be carried out by a person skilled in the art (a person conversant in the field of technology concerned).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The conditions of novelty and inventive step must be fulfilled by a certain date, generally the date on which the application is filed. An exception to this rule, covered by an applicant’s right of priority, is regulated by the Paris Convention. The right of priority means that, having filed an application in one member country of the Paris Convention, the same applicant (or their successor in title) may, within a specified time period, apply for protection for the same invention in any of the other member countries. These subsequent applications will not be invalidated by reason of any acts occurred between the filing date of the earliest application and the subsequent applications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For example, if an inventor first files an application for patent protection in Japan, and later a second application, with respect to the same invention, in France, it is sufficient that the conditions of novelty and non-obviousness existed at the date on which the Japanese application was filed. In other words, the later, French application retains priority over any applications relating to the same invention filed by other applicants between the date of the inventor’s first and second application. This is subject to the period between the two dates not exceeding 12 months.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Products and processes ===
It is customary to distinguish between inventions that consist of products and inventions that consist of processes. The creation of a new alloy is an example of a product invention. The invention of a new method or process of making a known or new alloy is a process invention. The corresponding patents are usually referred to respectively as a product patent and a process patent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Patentees ===
The person to whom a patent is granted is known as the patentee, the owner of the patent or the patent holder. Once a patent has been granted with respect to a particular country, anyone who wishes to exploit the invention commercially in that country must obtain the patentee’s authorization. In principle, anyone who exploits a patented invention without the patentee’s authorization commits an illegal act. Protection is granted for a limited period, generally 20 years. Once a patent expires, the protection ends, and the invention enters the public domain (also known as being “off patent”). The patentee no longer holds exclusive rights to the invention, which then becomes available for commercial exploitation by others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Rights conferred by a patent ===
The rights conferred by a patent are described in the patent law of the country in which the patent is granted. The patent owner’s exclusive rights generally consist of the following: 
* in the case of a product patent, the right to prevent third parties from making, using, offering for sale or selling the product, or importing it for these purposes, without the owner’s consent; and 
* in the case of a process patent, the right to prevent third parties from using the process without the owner’s consent; and to prevent third parties from using, offering for sale or selling the products obtained directly by that process, or importing them for these purposes, without the owner’s consent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The patentee is not given a statutory right to exploit the invention, but rather a statutory right to prevent others from commercially exploiting it. Patentees may give permission, or grant a license, to other parties to use their inventions on mutually agreed terms. They may also sell their patent rights to someone else, who then becomes the new patent owner. There are certain exceptions to the principle that a patented invention cannot legally be exploited without the authorization of the patent owner. These exceptions take into account the balance between the legitimate interests of the patent holder and those of competitors, consumers and others. For example, many patent laws allow a patented invention to be exploited without the patentee’s authorization: private acts for non-commercial purposes; acts for experimental purposes or scientific research; and acts for obtaining regulatory approval for pharmaceuticals. In addition, many laws provide for various situations under which compulsory licenses may be granted and government’s use of patented inventions without the authorization of the patent owner may be allowed in the wider public interest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Utility Models ==
{{Main|Utility model}}
Although not as widespread as patents, [[utility model]]s are also used to protect inventions. The rights conferred by utility models are similar to patent rights. Utility models are found in the laws of more than 50 countries, as well as in the regional agreements of the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO) and the African Intellectual Property Organization (OAPI). In addition, certain countries, such as Australia and Malaysia, provide for titles of protection called innovation patents or utility innovations which are similar to utility models. Other countries, like Ireland and Slovenia, have a short-term patent equivalent to the utility model. The expression “utility model” refers to a title of protection for certain inventions, such as inventions in the mechanical field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Utility model protection is usually sought for technically less complex inventions or for inventions that have a short commercial life. The procedure for obtaining protection for a utility model is usually simpler than that for seeking patent protection. Substantive and procedural requirements under the applicable laws vary widely among the countries and regions with a utility model system; however, utility models usually differ from patents for invention in the following main respects:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The requirements for acquiring a utility model are less stringent than for patents. While the “novelty” requirement must always be met, that of “inventive step” (or “non-obviousness”) may be much less evident or absent altogether. In practice, protection for utility models is often sought for innovations of an incremental nature that may not meet patentability criteria.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The maximum term of protectio provided for by law for a utility model is generally shorter than that provided for a patent for invention, usually between 7 and 10 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The fees required for obtaining and maintaining the right are generally lower than those for patents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Industrial Designs ==
{{Main|Industrial design}}
[[Industrial design]]s are applied to a wide variety of industrial products and handicrafts. They refer to the ornamental or aesthetic aspects of an article, including compositions of lines or colors or any three-dimensional forms that give a special appearance to a product or handicraft. The design must have aesthetic appeal. Moreover, it must be able to be reproduced by industrial means; this is the essential purpose of the design and the reason the design is called “industrial”. In a legal sense, an industrial design refers to the right granted in many countries, pursuant to a registration system, to protect the original, ornamental and nonfunctional features of a product resulting from design activity.Aesthetic appeal is one of the main factors influencing consumers in their product choice. Where the technical performance of a product offered by different manufacturers is relatively similar, consumers will make their selection based on price and aesthetic appeal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Aims of industrial design protection ===
By rewarding creators for their efforts, industrial design protection also serves as an incentive to invest in design activity. One of the basic aims of industrial design protection is to stimulate the design element of production. Industrial design laws therefore usually only protect designs that can be used in industry, or that can be produced on a large scale. This condition of industrial production is a notable difference between industrial design protection and copyright, since the latter concerns only aesthetic creations. However, in some cases, industrial designs may qualify for protection under copyright, for example where the design can be categorized as a work of applied art.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Originality ===
Industrial designs can generally be protected if they are new or original. Designs may not meet these criteria if they do not differ significantly from other existing designs or combinations thereof. In most industrial design laws, designs dictated solely by the article’s function are excluded from protection. If the design for an article produced by many manufacturers, such as a screw, were to be dictated purely by the function the screw was intended to perform, then protection for that design would have the effect of excluding all other manufacturers from producing items intended to perform the same function. Such exclusion is not warranted unless the design is sufficiently novel and inventive to qualify for patent protection. In other words, the legal protection offered by industrial designs concerns only the design that is applied to, or embodied in, articles or products. This protection does not prevent other manufacturers from producing or dealing in similar articles or products, as long as these do not embody or reproduce the protected design.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Protections ===
Industrial design registration protects against unauthorized exploitation of the design in industrial articles. It grants the owner of the design the exclusive right to make, import, sell, hire or offer for sale articles to which the design is applied or in which the design is embodied. The term for an industrial design right varies from country to country. The usual maximum term is from 10 to 25 years, often divided into terms requiring the proprietor to renew the registration in order to obtain an extension of protection. The relatively short period of protection may be related to the association of designs with more general styles of fashion, which tend to enjoy somewhat transient acceptance or success, particularly in highly fashion-conscious areas such as clothing or footwear.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Intellectual Property with Regard to Integrated Circuits ==
Although prefabricated components of [[Electrical Circuit|electrical circuitry]] have been used in the manufacture of [[electrical equipment]] (e.g [[radio]]s) for some time, large-scale integration of a multitude of electrical functions in a very small component became possible as a result of advances in [[semiconductor]] technology. Integrated circuits are manufactured in accordance with very detailed plans or layout-designs.The layout-designs of integrated circuits are creations of the [[Mind|human mind]]. They are usually the result of vast investment, in terms both of expertise and financial resources. There is a continuing need for the creation of new layout-designs that simultaneously reduce the dimensions of existing integrated circuits and increase their functions. The smaller an integrated circuit, the less material is needed for its manufacture, and the smaller the space needed to accommodate it. Integrated circuits are used in a wide range of products, including articles of everyday use such as watches, televisions, washing machine sand cars, as well as sophisticated computers and servers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although creating a new layout-design for an integrated circuit involves a major investment, it is possible to copy layout designs for a fraction of that cost. Copying may be done by photographing each layer of an integrated circuit and preparing masks for the production of the integrated circuit on the basis of those photographs. The high cost of creating layout-designs and the relative ease of copying them are the main reasons they need protection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Layout-designs of integrated circuits are not considered industrial designs in the sense described in the laws providing for the registration of industrial designs. This is because they do not determine the external appearance of integrated circuits but rather the physical location, within the integrated circuit, of each element having an electronic function. Moreover, layout-designs of integrated circuits are not normally patentable inventions, because their creation usually does not involve an inventive step – even though it requires a great deal of work by an expert. Furthermore, copyright protection may not apply if national law determines that layout-designs cannot be copyrighted. In response to the uncertainty surrounding the protection of layout-designs, the [[WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits]] was adopted on May 26, 1989. The Treaty has not entered into force; however, its substantive provisions have, to a large extent, been incorporated by reference in the [[Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property|Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS Agreement), concluded in 1994.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Trademarks ==
{{Main|Trademark}}
A [[trademark]] is a sign, or a combination of signs, that distinguishes the goods or services of one [[company]] from those of another. Such signs may use [[word]]s, letters, [[Number|numerals]], [[Image|pictures]], [[shape]]s and [[color]]s, or any combination thereof. An increasing number of countries also allow for the registration of less traditional forms of trademarks, such as three-dimensional signs (like the [[Coca-Cola]] bottle or [[Toblerone]] chocolate bar), audible signs (sounds such as the roar of the [[lion]] at the beginning of films produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]), or olfactory signs (such as the smell of a particular type of [[motor oil]] or [[embroidery yarn]]). However, many countries have set limits on what may be registered as a trademark, generally allowing only signs that are visually perceptible or can be represented graphically. Trademarks are used on goods or in connection with the market - ing of goods or services. The trademark may appear not only on the goods themselves but also on the container or packaging in which the goods are marketed. When used in connection with the sale of goods or services, the sign may appear in advertisements, for example, in newspapers, on television or in shop windows.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to trademarks identifying the commercial source of goods or services, several other categories of marks exist.

===Collective marks===
Collective marks are owned by an association, such as an association representing accountants or engineers, whose members use the mark to identify them with a particular level of quality and other requirements set by the association.

===Certification marks===
[[Certification mark]]s, such as the [[Woolmark]], are given for compliance with defined standards, but are not confined to any membership of an association.

===Service Mark===
A trademark used in connection with services is called a [[service mark]]. Service marks are used, for example, by [[hotel]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[airline]]s, [[Tourism agency|tourist agencies]], car-rental agencies, [[Laundry|laundries]] and [[cleaner]]s. All that has been said about trademarks also applies to service marks.

===Functions of trademarks===
Broadly speaking, trademarks perform four main functions:

* Distinguish the products or services of one company from those of other companies. Trademarks facilitate the choice to be made by consumers when buying certain products or using certain services. The trademark helps consumers to identify a product or service they are already familiar with or one that has been advertised. The distinctive character of a mark must be evaluated in relation to the goods or services to which the mark is applied. For example, the word “apple” or the image of an apple cannot distinguish apples, but it is distinctive for computers. Trademarks not only distinguish products or services as such, they also distinguish them in relation to the company offering the products or services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Refer to a particular company, not necessarily known to the consumer, that offers the products or services on the market. Trademarks therefore distinguish products or services from a given source from identical or similar products or services from other sources. This function is important in defining the scope of trademark protection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Refer to a particular quality of the product or service for which a mark is used, so that consumers can rely on the consistent quality of the goods or services offered under that mark. This function is commonly referred to as the guarantee function of trademarks. A trademark is not always used by only one company, since the trademark owner may grant licenses to use the trademark to other companies. It is accordingly essential that licensees respect the quality standards of the trademark owner. Moreover, companies often use trademarks for products they acquire from various sources in the course of business. In such cases, trademark owners are not responsible for producing the products, but instead (and this may be equally important) for selecting those that meet their quality standards and requirements. Even where trademark owners are the manufacturers of a particular product, they may use parts they have selected but not produced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Promote the marketing and sale of products, and the marketing and provision of services. Trademarks are not only used to distinguish or refer to a particular company or quality, but also to stimulate sales. A trademark used in this way must be carefully selected. It must appeal to the consumer, create interest and inspire a feeling of confidence. This is sometimes called the communication function. The owner of a registered trademark has an exclusive right in respect of the mark: the right to use the mark and to prevent unauthorized third parties from using it, or a confusingly similar mark, so as to prevent consumers and the public in general from being misled. The period of protection varies, but a trademark can be renewed indefinitely on payment of the necessary fees and on condition that the mark is used. Trademark protection is enforced by the courts which, in most systems, have the authority to block trademark infringement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Trade Names ==
{{Main|Trade name}}
Another category of industrial property covers commercial names and designations. A commercial or trade name is the name or designation that identifies a company. In most countries, trade names may be registered with a government authority. However, under Article 8 of the Paris Convention, a trade name must be protected without the obligation of filing or registration, whether or not it forms part of a trademark. Protection generally means that the trade name of one company may not be used by another company, either as a trade name or a trade or service mark – and that a name or designation similar to the trade name may not be used by another company if it is likely to mislead the public.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Geographical Indications ==
{{Main|Geographical indication}}
A geographical indication is a sign used on goods that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation due to that place of origin. Agricultural products typically have qualities deriving from their place of production and that are influenced by specific local factors , such as climate and soil. Whether a sign functions as an indication is a matter of national law and consumer perception. Geographical indications may be used for a wide variety of agricultural products, such as “Tuscany” for olive oil produced in a specific area of Italy, or “Roquefort” for cheese produced in a certain region of France.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The use of geographical indications is not limited to agricultural products. They may also highlight particular qualities of a product that are due to human factors found in the product’s place of origin, such as specific manufacturing skills and traditions. That place of origin may be a village or town, a region or a country. An example of a country geographical indication is “Switzerland” or “Swiss” for products made in Switzerland, in particular watches.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An appellation of origin is a special kind of geographical indication used on products that have a specific quality exclusively or essentially due to the geographical environment in which the products are produced. The term geographical indication encompasses appellations of origin. Examples of appellations of origin protected in states party to the Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration are “Habana”, for tobacco grown in the Havana region of Cuba, and “Tequila”, for spirits produced in particular areas of Mexico.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Protections ===
Geographical indications are protected in accordance with national laws in a wide range of ways, such as under laws against unfair competition, consumer protection laws, laws for the protection of certification marks or special laws for the protection of geographical indications or appellations of origin. In essence, unauthorized parties may not use geographical indications where that use is likely to mislead the public as to the true origin of the product. Applicable sanctions range from court injunctions preventing unauthorized use to the payment of damages and fines or, in serious cases, imprisonment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Protection against Unfair Competition ==
Article 10 bis of the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention]] requires member countries to provide for protection against unfair competition. According to this article, the following acts of competition are considered contrary to honest trade and industry practices: 
* All acts of such a nature as to create confusion with the establishment, the goods or the industrial or commercial activities of a competitor; 
* False allegations in the course of trade of such a nature as to discredit the establishment, the goods or the industrial or commercial activities of a competitor; and 
* Indications or allegations, the use of which in the course of trade are liable to mislead the public as to the characteristics of certain goods. 
Protection against unfair competition supplements the protection of inventions, industrial designs, trademarks and geographical indications. It is particularly important for the protection of knowledge, technology or information that is not protected by a patent but that may be required in order to make best use of a patented invention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The Role of the World Intellectual Property Organization ==
{{Main|World Intellectual Property Organization}}
The [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) is an international organization dedicated to promoting creativity and innovation by ensuring that the rights of creators and owners of IP are protected worldwide, and that inventors and authors are recognized and rewarded for their ingenuity. As a specialized agency of the United Nations, WIPO provides a forum for its member states to create and harmonize rules and practices for protecting IP rights. Most developed countries have protection systems that are centuries old, while developing countries continue to create legal and administrative frameworks to protect their patents, trademarks, designs and copyright. WIPO assists its member states in developing these new systems through treaty negotiation, legal and technical assistance, and training in various forms, including in the area of enforcement of IP rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Systems ===
WIPO also provides international registration systems for trademarks, industrial designs and appellations of origin, and an international filing system for patents. These systems greatly simplify the process of seeking IP protection simultaneously in a large number of countries. Instead of having to file separate national applications, in different languages, in each country in which protection is sought, applicants can file a single application, in one language, with a single application fee. The WIPO-administered systems include four different mechanisms of protection for specific industrial property rights:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) System, for filing patent applications in multiple countries.
* the Madrid System for the International Registration of Marks, for trade and service marks. 
* the Hague System for the International Registration of Industrial Designs. 
* the Lisbon System for the International Registration of Appellations of Origin.

Anyone applying for a patent or registering a trademark or design, whether at the national or international level, needs to determine whether their creation is new or already owned or claimed by someone else. To do this, huge amounts of information must be searched. Four WIPO treaties have created classification systems that organise information on different branches of industrial property into indexed, manageable structures for easy retrieval.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  They are: 
* the Strasbourg Agreement Concerning the International Patent Classification; 
* the Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks; • the Vienna Agreement Establishing an International Classification of the Figurative Elements of Marks; and 
* the Locarno Agreement Establishing an International Classification for Industrial Designs.

===WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center===
The WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center provides services for the resolution of international IP disputes between private parties. Such proceedings can include contractual disputes (such as patent and software licenses, trademark coexistence agreements, and research and development agreements) and non-contractual disputes (such as patent infringement). The Center is also recognized as the leading dispute resolution service provider for disputes arising from the abusive registration and use of Internet domain names.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Law in ''Star Trek''''' refers to the legal procedures and processes as seen in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[fictional universe]]. In several TV episodes and films since its inception in the 1960s, ''Star Trek'' has used fictional legal constraints and consequences as a plot device both as a parable for contemporary society in the real world, and to explore the society and politics of the future.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Michael Stokes Paulsen, ''CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK AND THE ENTERPRISE OF CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION: SOME MODEST PROPOSALS FROM THE TWENTY-THIRD CENTURY'', 59 Alb. L. Rev. 671 (1995); Paul Joseph and Sharon Carton, ''THE LAW OF THE FEDERATION: IMAGES OF LAW, LAWYERS, AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM IN "STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION"'', 24 U. Tol. L. Rev. 43 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

A discussion of this subject by Paul Joseph and Sharon Carton in the ''University of Toledo Law Review'' examines how this fictional set of laws deals with controversial issues in American law, such as the [[right to life]] and [[privacy]], as well as the law's response to [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=QI4zk6H48kwC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=star+trek+law+-physics&amp;ots=T7zTp3mQrP&amp;sig=gmuiopLYkSBS749jL3RU4Q7GkTM Star Trek Visions of Law and Justice] Robert Chaires and Bradley Chilton. p73&lt;/ref&gt; The details and application of these laws, and the ways in which these reflect real-world legal systems, are further examined in the ''Adventures in Law and Justice: Exploring big legal questions in everyday life'' by Bryan Horrigan and ''Star Trek Visions of Law and Justice'' edited by Robert Chaires and Bradley Chilton. The former discusses the possibility of applying a comparison between law and a part of popular culture to the teaching of national and international law.

==United Federation of Planets==
{{Main|United Federation of Planets}}
In ''Star Trek'', the Federation is depicted as a [[utopia]]n interplanetary federal republic stressing the importance of sentient rights, respect for life, and non-aggression. The government resembles a [[representative democracy]]. A legislative, judiciary, and executive branch are present. The [[Prime Directive]], a controversial guiding principle of the Federation, states that there should be no interference with the development of any pre-warp alien civilization; the only known higher law in the Federation (according to canon) is the highly classified '[[The Omega Directive|Omega Directive]]', which directs captains to seek out and destroy the extremely dangerous 'omega particle' and effectively 'rescinds' the Prime Directive.

The '''Liévano–Brutus treaty''' is a [[treaty]] that defined the [[maritime boundary]] between the [[Republic of Colombia]] and [[Haiti]]. The treaty was signed in the town of [[Port-au-Prince]] on February 17, 1978. The treaty was approved by the [[Congress of Colombia]] by Law 12 of 1978. Ratification of the treaty was officially done on February 16, 1979. The treaty also stipulates that there must be cooperation on environmental issues and the protection of migratory species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sogeocol.edu.co/Ova/fronteras_colombia/fronteras/caribe/caribe_haiti.html {{es icon}} Sociedad Colombiana de Geografia: Frontera con Haiti]&lt;/ref&gt;

The full name of the treaty is ''Agreement on Delimitation of the Maritime Boundaries between the Republic of Colombia and the Republic of Haiti''. It is named for the foreign ministers of the two countries that signed the agreement—[[Indalecio Liévano]] of Colombia and [[Edner Brutus]] of Haiti.

The '''Louisiana Purchase''' ({{lang-fr|Vente de la Louisiane}} "Sale of Louisiana") was the acquisition of the [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana territory]] ({{Convert|828000|sqmi|km2 acre|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}) by the [[United States]] from [[French First Republic|France]] in 1803. The U.S. paid fifty million [[French franc|francs]] ($11,250,000) and a cancellation of debts worth eighteen million francs ($3,750,000) for a total of sixty-eight million francs ($15 million, equivalent to about ${{Format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|15000000|1803}}}} in {{inflation/year|US-GDP}}). The Louisiana territory included land from fifteen present [[U.S. state]]s and two [[Canadian provinces]]. The territory contained land that forms [[Arkansas]], [[Missouri]], [[Iowa]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Kansas]], and [[Nebraska]]; the portion of [[Minnesota]] west of the [[Mississippi River]]; a large portion of [[North Dakota]]; a large portion of [[South Dakota]]; the northeastern section of [[New Mexico]]; the northern portion of [[Texas]]; the area of [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]], and [[Colorado]] east of the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]]; [[Louisiana]] west of the Mississippi River (plus [[Île d'Orléans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]); and small portions of land within the present Canadian provinces of [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]]. Its non-native population was around 60,000 inhabitants, of whom half were [[Slavery in the United States|African slaves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PHhHAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA5-PA56 |title=Congressional series of United States public documents|date=January 1, 1864|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Early modern France|Kingdom of France]] controlled the Louisiana territory from 1699 until it was [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|ceded]] to [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] in 1762.  In 1800, [[Napoleon]], then the First Consul of the French Republic, hoping to re-establish an empire in North America, regained ownership of Louisiana. However, France's failure to put down the [[Haitian Revolution|revolt in Saint-Domingue]], coupled with the prospect of renewed warfare with the United Kingdom, prompted Napoleon to sell Louisiana to the United States to fund his military. The Americans originally sought to purchase only the port city of [[New Orleans]] and its adjacent coastal lands, but quickly accepted the bargain. The Louisiana Purchase occurred during the term of the third [[President of the United States]], [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Before the purchase was finalized, the decision faced [[Federalist Party]] opposition; they argued that it was unconstitutional to acquire any territory. Jefferson agreed that the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] did not contain explicit provisions for acquiring territory, but he asserted that his constitutional power to negotiate treaties was sufficient.

==Background==
[[File:Louisiana1804a.jpg|thumb|1804 map of "[[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]", edged on the west by the [[Rocky Mountains]]]]

Throughout the second half of the 18th century, Louisiana was a pawn on the chessboard of European politics.&lt;ref name="Herring, George p99"&gt;{{harvp|Herring|2008|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was controlled by the French, who had a few small settlements along the Mississippi and other main rivers. France ceded the territory to Spain in the secret [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)]]. Following French defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]], Spain gained control of [[Louisiana (New France)|the territory]] west of the Mississippi and the British the territory to the east of the river.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{harvp|Meinig|1995|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the establishment of the United States, the Americans controlled the area east of the Mississippi and north of New Orleans. The main issue for the Americans was free transit of the Mississippi to the sea.  As the lands were being gradually settled by a few American migrants, many Americans, including Jefferson, assumed that [[Louisiana (New Spain)|the territory]] would be acquired "piece by piece."  The risk of another power taking it from a weakened Spain made a "profound reconsideration" of this policy necessary.&lt;ref name="Herring, George p99"/&gt;  New Orleans was already important for shipping agricultural goods to and from the areas of the United States west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. [[Pinckney's Treaty]], signed with Spain on October 27, 1795, gave American merchants "right of deposit" in New Orleans, granting them use of the port to store goods for export. Americans used this right to transport products such as flour, tobacco, pork, bacon, lard, feathers, cider, butter, and cheese. The treaty also recognized American rights to navigate the entire Mississippi, which had become vital to the growing trade of the western territories.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1798, Spain revoked the treaty allowing American use of New Orleans, greatly upsetting Americans. In 1801, Spanish Governor Don [[Juan Manuel de Salcedo]] took over from the [[List of colonial governors of Louisiana#Spanish period|Marquess of Casa Calvo]], and restored the American right to deposit goods. However, in 1800 Spain had ceded the Louisiana territory back to France as part of [[Napoleon]]'s secret [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3586&amp;context=open_access_etds|title=The Role of American Diplomacy in the Louisiana Purchase|last=Warren|first=Rebecca|date=1976|website=pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The territory nominally remained under Spanish control, until a transfer of power to [[French First Republic|France]] on November 30, 1803, just three weeks before the formal cession of the territory to the United States on December 20, 1803.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Louisiana-Purchase|title=Louisiana Purchase {{!}} History, Facts, &amp; Map|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=July 21, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further ceremony was held in [[St. Louis]], [[Illinois Country|Upper Louisiana]] regarding the [[New Orleans]] formalities. The March 9–10, 1804 event is remembered as [[Three Flags Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.historynaked.com/three-flags-day/|title=Three Flags Day - Naked History|date=March 15, 2017|work=Naked History|access-date=November 21, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/03/0323_040323_lewisclark2_2.html|title=Reliving Lewis and Clark: Louisiana Purchase Ceremony|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=November 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Monroe]] and [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert R. Livingston]] had traveled to [[Paris]] to negotiate the purchase of New Orleans in January 1803. Their instructions were to negotiate or purchase control of New Orleans and its environs; they did not anticipate the much larger acquisition which would follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/news/8-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-louisiana-purchase|title=8 Things You May Not Know About the Louisiana Purchase|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Louisiana Purchase was by far the largest territorial gain in U.S. history. Stretching from the [[Mississippi River]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]], the purchase doubled the size of the [[United States]]. Before 1803, Louisiana had been under [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish control]] for forty years. Although Spain aided the [[Thirteen Colonies|rebels]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]], the Spanish didn't want the Americans to settle in their territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/louisiana-purchase|title=Louisiana Purchase - Facts &amp; Summary - HISTORY.com|website=HISTORY.com|access-date=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the purchase was thought of by some as unjust and unconstitutional, Jefferson determined that his constitutional power to negotiate treaties allowed the purchase of what became fifteen states. In hindsight, the Louisiana Purchase could be considered one of his greatest contributions to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thompson|2006|pp=4–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On April 18, 1802, Jefferson penned a letter to United States Ambassador to France Robert Livingston. It was an intentional exhortation to make this supposedly mild diplomat strongly warn the French of their perilous course. The letter began:
{{quotation|The cession of Louisiana and the Floridas by Spain to France works most sorely on the U.S. On this subject the Secretary of State has written to you fully. Yet I cannot forbear recurring to it personally, so deep is the impression it makes in my mind. It completely reverses all the political relations of the U.S. and will form a new epoch in our political course. Of all nations of any consideration France is the one which hitherto has offered the fewest points on which we could have any conflict of right, and the most points of a communion of interests. From these causes we have ever looked to her as our natural friend, as one with which we never could have an occasion of difference. Her growth therefore we viewed as our own, her misfortunes ours. There is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is our natural and habitual enemy. It is New Orleans, through which the produce of three-eighths of our territory must pass to market, and from its fertility it will ere long yield more than half of our whole produce and contain more than half our inhabitants. France placing herself in that door assumes to us the attitude of defiance. Spain might have retained it quietly for years. Her pacific dispositions, her feeble state, would induce her to increase our facilities there, so that her possession of the place would be hardly felt by us, and it would not perhaps be very long before some circumstance might arise which might make the cession of it to us the price of something of more worth to her. Not so can it ever be in the hands of France. The impetuosity of her temper, the energy and restlessness of her character, placed in a point of eternal friction with us...}}

Jefferson's letter went on with the same heat to a much quoted passage about "the day that France takes possession of New Orleans." Not only did he say that day would be a low point in France's history, for it would seal America's marriage with the British fleet and nation, but he added, astonishingly, that it would start a massive shipbuilding program.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cerami|2003|pp=57-58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negotiation==
While the transfer of the territory by Spain back to France in 1800 went largely unnoticed, fear of an eventual French invasion spread nationwide when, in 1801, Napoleon sent a military force to secure New Orleans. Southerners feared that Napoleon would free all the slaves in Louisiana, which could trigger slave uprisings elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Herring, George p100"&gt;{{harvp|Herring|2008|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Jefferson urged moderation, Federalists sought to use this against Jefferson and called for hostilities against France. Undercutting them, Jefferson took up the banner and threatened an alliance with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], although relations were uneasy in that direction.&lt;ref name="Herring, George p100" /&gt; In 1801 Jefferson supported France in its plan to take back [[Saint-Domingue]] (present-day [[Haiti]]), which was then under control of [[Toussaint Louverture]] after a [[slave rebellion]].

Jefferson sent Livingston to Paris in 1801&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1801-1829/louisiana-purchase|title=Milestones: 1801–1829 - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov|language=en|access-date=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; after discovering the transfer of Louisiana from Spain to France under the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]]. Livingston was authorized to purchase New Orleans.

In January 1802, France sent [[Charles Leclerc|General Charles Leclerc]] to [[Saint-Domingue]] (present-day [[Haiti]]) to [[Saint-Domingue_expedition|re-establish slavery]], which had been abolished by the [[Constitution_of_the_Year_III|constitution of the French Republic of 1795]], as well as to reduce the rights of [[free people of color]] and take back control of the island from [[Toussaint Louverture]]. Louverture had fended off invasions of St. Domingue by the Spanish and British empires, but had also begun to consolidate power for himself on the island. Before the Revolution, France had derived enormous wealth from St. Domingue at the cost of the lives and freedom of the slaves. Napoleon wanted its revenues and productivity for France restored. Alarmed over the French actions and its intention to re-establish an empire in North America, Jefferson declared neutrality in relation to the [[Caribbean]], refusing credit and other assistance to the French, but allowing war contraband to get through to the rebels to prevent France from regaining a foothold.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Matthewson|1995|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1803, France withdrew its 7,000 surviving troops from [[Saint-Domingue]] (more than two-thirds of its troops died there) and gave up its ambitions in the [[Western Hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Matthewson|1995|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1804 Haiti declared its independence; but, fearing a slave revolt at home, Jefferson and Congress refused to recognize the new republic, the second in the Western Hemisphere, and imposed a trade [[embargo]] against it. This, together with later claims by France to reconquer Haiti, encouraged by the United Kingdom, made it more difficult for Haiti to recover after ten years of wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Matthewson|1996|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803, [[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours]], a French nobleman, began to help negotiate with France at the request of Jefferson. Du Pont was living in the United States at the time and had close ties to Jefferson as well as the prominent politicians in France. He engaged in back-channel diplomacy with Napoleon on Jefferson's behalf during a visit to France and originated the idea of the much larger Louisiana Purchase as a way to defuse potential conflict between the United States and Napoleon over North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Duke|1977|pp=77–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson disliked the idea of purchasing Louisiana from France, as that could imply that France had a right to be in Louisiana. Jefferson had concerns that a U.S. president did not have the constitutional authority to make such a deal. He also thought that to do so would erode [[states' rights]] by increasing federal executive power. On the other hand, he was aware of the potential threat that France could be in that region and was prepared to go to war to prevent a strong French presence there.{{Citation needed|reason=While I'm reasonably sure this is true, it's a bold claim that ought to be sourced.|date=May 2013}}

Throughout this time, Jefferson had up-to-date intelligence on Napoleon's military activities and intentions in North America. Part of his evolving strategy involved giving du Pont some information that was withheld from Livingston. He also gave intentionally conflicting instructions to the two.{{Citation needed|reason=I have been unable to find evidence of this from some quick searches on Google. If this is true, it ought to be sourced, to allow further investigation.|date=August 2014}} Desperate to avoid possible war with France, Jefferson sent [[James Monroe]] to [[Paris]] in 1803 to negotiate a settlement, with instructions to go to [[London]] to negotiate an alliance if the talks in Paris failed. Spain procrastinated until late 1802 in executing the treaty to transfer [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]] to [[French First Republic|France]], which allowed American hostility to build. Also, Spain's refusal to cede [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] to France meant that Louisiana would be indefensible. Monroe had been formally expelled from France on his last diplomatic mission, and the choice to send him again conveyed a sense of seriousness.

Napoleon needed peace with the United Kingdom to implement the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]] and take possession of Louisiana. Otherwise, Louisiana would be an easy prey for the UK or even for the United States. But in early 1803, continuing war between France and the UK seemed unavoidable. On March 11, 1803, Napoleon began preparing to invade the UK.

As Napoleon had failed to re-enslave the emancipated population of Haiti, he abandoned his plans to rebuild France's [[New World]] empire. Without sufficient revenues from [[Sugar cane|sugar]] colonies in the [[Caribbean]], Louisiana had little value to him. Spain had not yet completed the transfer of Louisiana to France, and war between France and the UK was imminent. Out of anger towards Spain and the unique opportunity to sell something that was useless and not truly his yet, Napoleon decided to sell the entire territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Herring|2008|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (France)|foreign minister]] [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]] opposed the plan, on April 10, 1803, Napoleon told the Treasury Minister [[François Barbé-Marbois]] that he was considering selling the entire Louisiana Territory to the United States. On April 11, 1803, just days before Monroe's arrival, Barbé-Marbois offered Livingston all of Louisiana for $15 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1012/3-of-the-most-lucrative-land-deals-in-history.aspx|title=3 Of The Most Lucrative Land Deals In History|first=Justin|last=Kuepper|date=October 8, 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which averages to less than three cents per acre (7¢/ha).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Burgan|2002|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Louisiana.html|title=Primary Documents of American History: Louisiana Purchase|work=Web Guides|publisher=Library of Congress|date=March 29, 2011|accessdate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The American representatives were prepared to pay up to $10 million for New Orleans and its environs, but were dumbfounded when the vastly larger territory was offered for $15 million. Jefferson had authorized Livingston only to purchase New Orleans. However, Livingston was certain that the United States would accept the offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Malone|Roeder|Lang|1991|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Americans thought that Napoleon might withdraw the offer at any time, preventing the United States from acquiring New Orleans, so they agreed and signed the Louisiana Purchase Treaty on April 30, 1803.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|title=Louisiana Purchase Treaty}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 4, 1803, the treaty was announced,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-louisiana-purchase-jeffersons-constitutional-gamble |title=The Louisiana Purchase: Jefferson's constitutional gamble |date=2017-10-20 |website=National Constitution Center |language=en |access-date=2018-04-29 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the documents did not arrive in [[Washington, D.C.]] until July 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-26-02-0001-0101 |title=Purchase of Louisiana, [5 July 1803] |at=Footnote 2 |website=Founders Online |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] |language=en |access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Louisiana Territory was vast, stretching from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in the south to [[Rupert's Land]] in the north, and from the Mississippi River in the east to the [[Rocky Mountains]] in the west. Acquiring the territory would double the size of the United States, at a sum of less than 3 cents per acre.

==Domestic opposition and constitutionality==
[[File:louisiana purchase treaty.jpg|thumb|The original treaty of the Louisiana Purchase]]

[[Henry Adams]] and other historians have argued that Jefferson acted hypocritically with the Louisiana Purchase, due to his position as a [[Strict constructionism|strict constructionist]] regarding the Constitution since he stretched the intent of that document to justify his purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rodriguez|2002|pp=139–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument goes as follows:

The American purchase of the Louisiana territory was not accomplished without domestic opposition. Jefferson's philosophical consistency was in question because of his strict interpretation of the Constitution. Many people believed that he and others, including [[James Madison]], were doing something they surely would have argued against with [[Alexander Hamilton]]. The [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] strongly opposed the purchase, favoring close relations with Britain over closer ties to Napoleon, and were  concerned that the United States had paid a large sum of money just to declare war on Spain.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Both Federalists and Jeffersonians were concerned over the purchase's constitutionality. Many members of the House of Representatives opposed the purchase. Majority Leader [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]] led the opposition. The House called for a vote to deny the request for the purchase, but it failed by two votes, 59–57. The Federalists even tried to prove the land belonged to Spain, not France, but available records proved otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fleming|2003|pp=149ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federalists also feared that the power of the [[Atlantic seaboard]] states would be threatened by the new citizens in the West, whose political and economic priorities were bound to conflict with those of the merchants and bankers of [[New England]]. There was also concern that an increase in the number of slave-holding states created out of the new territory would exacerbate divisions between North and South as well. A group of Northern Federalists led by Senator [[Timothy Pickering]] of Massachusetts went so far as to explore the idea of a separate northern confederacy.

Another concern was whether it was proper to grant citizenship to the French, Spanish, and free black people living in New Orleans, as the treaty would dictate. Critics in Congress worried whether these "foreigners", unacquainted with democracy, could or should become citizens. The U.S. Government had to use English Common Law to make them citizens to collect taxes.&lt;ref name=nugent&gt;{{harvp|Nugent|2009|pp=65–68}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain protested the transfer on two grounds: First, France had previously promised in a note not to alienate Louisiana to a third party and second, France had not fulfilled the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]] by having the King of [[Kingdom of Etruria|Etruria]] recognized by all European powers. The French government replied that these objections were baseless since the promise not to alienate Louisiana was not in the treaty of San Ildefonso itself and therefore had no legal force, and the Spanish government had ordered Louisiana to be transferred in October 1802 despite knowing for months that Britain had not recognized the King of Etruria in the [[Treaty of Amiens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gayarre|1867|p=544}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Louisianatransfer exposition1904 vc180.jpg|thumb|left|''Transfer of Louisiana'' by Ford P. Kaiser for the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] (1904)]]

[[Henry Adams]] claimed "The sale of Louisiana to the United States was trebly invalid; if it were French property, Bonaparte could not constitutionally alienate it without the consent of the French [[Sénat conservateur|Chambers]]; if it were Spanish property, he could not alienate it at all; if Spain had a right of reclamation, his sale was worthless."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Adams|2011|pp=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of course was not "worthless"—the U.S. actually did take possession. Furthermore, the Spanish prime minister had authorized the U.S. to negotiate with the French government "the acquisition of territories which may suit their interests." Spain turned the territory over to France in a ceremony in New Orleans on November 30, a month before France turned it over to American officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nugent|2009|pp=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other historians counter the above arguments regarding Jefferson's alleged hypocrisy by asserting that countries change their borders in two ways: (1) conquest, or (2) an agreement between nations, otherwise known as a treaty. The Louisiana Purchase was the latter, a treaty. The Constitution specifically grants the president the power to negotiate treaties (Art. II, Sec. 2), which is just what Jefferson did.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lawson|Seidman|2008|pp=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson's [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[James Madison]] (the "Father of the Constitution"), assured Jefferson that the Louisiana Purchase was well within even the strictest interpretation of the Constitution. Treasury Secretary [[Albert Gallatin]] added that since the power to negotiate treaties was specifically granted to the president, the only way extending the country's territory by treaty could ''not'' be a presidential power would be if it were specifically excluded by the Constitution (which it was not). Jefferson, as a strict constructionist, was right to be concerned about staying within the bounds of the Constitution, but felt the power of these arguments and was willing to "acquiesce with satisfaction" if the Congress approved the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Banning|1995|pp=7–9, 178, 326–7, 330–3, 345–6, 360–1, 371, 384}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Senate|Senate]] quickly ratified the treaty, and the [[U.S. House of Representatives|House]], with equal alacrity, authorized the required funding, as the Constitution specifies.&lt;ref name="Ketcham"&gt;{{harvp|Ketcham|2003|pp=420–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The fledgling United States did not have $15 million in its treasury; it borrowed the sum from Great Britain, at an annual interest rate of six percent. [http://www.americanhistory.about.com/od/thomasjefferson/a/tj_lapurchase.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposition of New England Federalists to the Louisiana Purchase was primarily economic self-interest, not any legitimate concern over constitutionality or whether France indeed owned Louisiana or was required to sell it back to Spain should it desire to dispose of the territory. The Northerners were not enthusiastic about Western farmers gaining another outlet for their crops that did not require the use of New England ports. Also, many Federalists were speculators in lands in upstate New York and New England and were hoping to sell these lands to farmers, who might go west instead, if the Louisiana Purchase went through. They also feared that this would lead to Western states being formed, which would likely be Republican, and dilute the political power of New England Federalists.&lt;ref name="Ketcham"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|2003|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Spain later objected to the United States purchasing Louisiana from France, Madison responded that America had first approached Spain about purchasing the property, but had been told by Spain itself that America would have to treat with France for the territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peterson|first=Merrill D.|title=James Madison: A Biography in his Own Words|pages=237–46|work=Newsweek|year=1974}}{{full|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treaty signing==
[[File:Louisiana Purchase 1953 Issue-3c.jpg|thumb|Issue of 1953, commemorating the 150th Anniversary of signing]]

The Louisiana Purchase Treaty was signed on April 30 by [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert Livingston]], [[James Monroe]], and [[François Barbé-Marbois]] in [[Paris, France|Paris]]. Jefferson announced the treaty to the American people on July 4. After the signing of the Louisiana Purchase agreement in 1803, Livingston made this famous statement, "We have lived long, but this is the noblest work of our whole lives... From this day the United States take their place among the powers of the first rank."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpb.org/education/tah/lapurchase/quotes.cfm|title=America's Louisiana Purchase: Noble Bargain, Difficult Journey|publisher=Lpb.org|accessdate=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Senate]] advised and consented to ratification of the treaty with a vote of twenty-four to seven on October 20. The Senators who voted against the treaty were:  [[Simeon Olcott]] and [[William Plumer]] of New Hampshire, [[William H. Wells|William Wells]] and [[Samuel White (American politician)|Samuel White]] of Delaware, [[James Hillhouse]] and [[Uriah Tracy]] of Connecticut, and [[Timothy Pickering]] of Massachusetts.

On the following day, October 21, 1803, the Senate authorized Jefferson to take possession of the territory and establish a temporary military government. In legislation enacted on October 31, Congress made temporary provisions for local civil government to continue as it had under French and Spanish rule and authorized the President to use military forces to maintain order. Plans were also set forth for several missions to explore and chart the territory, the most famous being the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/louisiana-purchase|title=Louisiana Purchase {{!}} Thomas Jefferson's Monticello|website=www.monticello.org|language=en|access-date=November 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal transfers and initial organization==
[[File:Louisiana Purchase New Orleans Thure de Thulstrup.jpg|thumb|Flag raising in the [[Jackson Square (New Orleans)|Place d'Armes]] of [[New Orleans]], marking the transfer of sovereignty over French Louisiana to the United States, December 20, 1803, as depicted by [[Thure de Thulstrup]]]]

[[French First Republic|France]] turned over [[New Orleans]], the historic colonial [[Capital city|capital]], on December 20, 1803, at [[the Cabildo]], with a [[Flag#Hoisting the flag|flag-raising]] ceremony in the Plaza de Armas, now [[Jackson Square (New Orleans)|Jackson Square]]. Just three weeks earlier, on November 30, 1803, Spanish officials had formally conveyed the colonial lands and their administration to France.

On March 9 and 10, 1804, another ceremony, commemorated as [[Three Flags Day]], was conducted in [[St. Louis]], to transfer ownership of [[Illinois Country|Upper Louisiana]] from [[New Spain|Spain]] to the [[French First Republic]], and then from France to the [[United States]]. From March 10 to September 30, 1804, Upper Louisiana was supervised as a military district, under [[Commandant]] [[Amos Stoddard]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Effective October 1, 1804, the purchased territory was [[organized territory|organized]] into the [[Territory of Orleans]] (most of which would become the [[U.S. state|state]] of Louisiana) and the [[District of Louisiana]], which was temporarily under control of the governor and judicial system of the [[Indiana Territory]]. The following year, the District of Louisiana was renamed the [[Louisiana Territory|Territory of Louisiana]], aka Louisiana Territory (1805–1812).{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

New Orleans was the administrative capital of the Orleans Territory, and St. Louis was the capital of the Louisiana Territory.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Boundaries==
A dispute soon arose between Spain and the United States regarding the extent of Louisiana. The territory's boundaries had not been defined in the 1762 [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] that ceded it from France to Spain, nor in the 1801 Third Treaty of San Ildefonso ceding it back to France, nor the 1803 Louisiana Purchase agreement ceding it to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schoultz|1998|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. claimed Louisiana included the entire western portion of the Mississippi River drainage basin to the crest of the Rocky Mountains and land extending southeast to the [[Rio Grande]] and [[West Florida]].&lt;ref name="Haynes2010"&gt;{{harvp|Haynes|2010|pp=115–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain insisted that Louisiana comprised no more than the western bank of the Mississippi River and the cities of New Orleans and St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hämäläinen|2008|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute was ultimately resolved by the [[Adams–Onís Treaty]] of 1819, with the United States gaining most of what it had claimed in the west.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[File:UnitedStatesExpansion.png|thumb|upright=1.6|left|The Purchase was one of several territorial additions to the U.S.]]

The relatively narrow [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]] of [[New Spain]] had been a special province under the jurisdiction of the [[Captaincy General of Cuba]] while the vast region to the west was in 1803 still considered part of the Commandancy General of the [[Provincias Internas]]. Louisiana had never been considered one of New Spain's internal provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Weber|1994|pp=223, 293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the territory included all the tributaries of the Mississippi on its western bank, the northern reaches of the Purchase extended into the equally ill-defined British possession—[[Rupert's Land]] of [[British North America]], now part of Canada. The Purchase originally extended just beyond the [[50th parallel north|50th parallel]]. However, the territory north of the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] (including the [[Milk River (Alberta–Montana)|Milk River]] and [[Poplar River (Montana–Saskatchewan)|Poplar River]] watersheds) was ceded to the UK in exchange for parts of the [[Red River Basin]] south of [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] in the [[Treaty of 1818|Anglo-American Convention of 1818]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The eastern boundary of the Louisiana purchase was the Mississippi River, from its source to the [[31st parallel north|31st parallel]], though [[Lake Itasca|the source of the Mississippi]] was, at the time, unknown. The eastern boundary below the 31st parallel was unclear. The U.S. claimed the land as far as the [[Perdido River]], and Spain claimed that the border of its Florida Colony remained the [[Mississippi River]]. In early 1804, Congress passed the Mobile Act, which recognized [[West Florida]] as part of the United States. The Adams–Onís Treaty with Spain (1819) resolved the issue upon ratification in 1821. Today, the 31st parallel is the northern boundary of the western half of the [[Florida Panhandle]], and the Perdido is the western boundary of Florida.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Because the western boundary was contested at the time of the Purchase, President Jefferson immediately began to organize three missions to explore and map the new territory. All three started from the Mississippi River. The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] (1804) traveled up the [[Missouri River]]; the [[Red River Expedition (1806)|Red River Expedition]] (1806) explored the Red River basin; the [[Pike Expedition]] (1806) also started up the Missouri, but turned south to explore the [[Arkansas River]] watershed. The maps and journals of the explorers helped to define the boundaries during the negotiations leading to the Adams–Onís Treaty, which set the western boundary as follows: north up the [[Sabine River (Texas–Louisiana)|Sabine River]] from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to its intersection with the [[32nd parallel north|32nd parallel]], due north to the [[Red River of the South|Red River]], up the Red River to the [[100th meridian west|100th meridian]], north to the [[Arkansas River]], up the Arkansas River to its headwaters, due north to the [[42nd parallel north|42nd parallel]] and due west to its previous boundary.

==Slavery==
{{see also|History of slavery in Louisiana|History of slavery in Missouri|Slavery in the United States}}
Governing the Louisiana Territory was more difficult than acquiring it. Its European peoples, of ethnic French, Spanish and Mexican descent, were largely [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]; in addition, there was a large population of [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved Africans]] made up of a high proportion of recent arrivals, as [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spain]] had continued the international [[slave trade]]. This was particularly true in the area of the present-day state of Louisiana, which also contained a large number of [[free people of color]]. Both present-day Arkansas and Missouri already had some [[slaveholder]]s in the early 19th century.

During this period, south Louisiana received an influx of French-speaking refugee [[Planter (American South)|planters]], who were permitted to bring their slaves with them, and other refugees fleeing the large [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolt]] in [[Saint-Domingue]], today's [[Haiti]]. Many Southern slaveholders feared that acquisition of the new territory might inspire American-held slaves to follow the example of those in Saint-Domingue and revolt. They wanted the US government to establish laws allowing slavery in the newly acquired territory so they could be supported in taking their slaves there to undertake new agricultural enterprises, as well as to reduce the threat of future [[slave rebellion]]s.&lt;ref name="Herring, George p104"&gt;{{harvp|Herring|2008|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Louisiana Territory was broken into smaller portions for administration, and the territories passed slavery laws similar to those in the southern states but incorporating provisions from the preceding French and Spanish rule (for instance, Spain had prohibited slavery of Native Americans in 1769, but some slaves of mixed [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]]-[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] descent were still being held in [[St. Louis]] in [[Illinois Country|Upper Louisiana]] when the U.S. took over).&lt;ref name="Foley"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://statehistoricalsocietyofmissouri.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/mhr&amp;CISOPTR=41510&amp;CISOSHOW=41366|first=William E.|last=Foley|title=Slave Freedom Suits before Dred Scott: The Case of Marie Jean Scypion's Descendants|journal=Missouri Historical Review|volume=79|issue=1|date=October 1984|page=1|via=The State Historical Society of Missouri|access-date=February 18, 2011}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[freedom suit]] that went from Missouri to the [[US Supreme Court]], slavery of Native Americans was finally ended in 1836.&lt;ref name="Foley"/&gt; The institutionalization of slavery under U.S. law in the Louisiana Territory contributed to the [[American Civil War]] a half century later.&lt;ref name="Herring, George p104"/&gt; As states organized within the territory, the status of slavery in each state became a matter of contention in Congress, as southern states wanted slavery extended to the west, and northern states just as strongly opposed new states being admitted as "[[Free and slave states|slave states]]."

The [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820 was a temporary solution.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Asserting U.S. possession==
[[File:Fort Madison 1810.jpg|thumb|upright|Plan of [[Fort Madison]], built in 1808 to establish U.S. control over the northern part of the Louisiana Purchase, drawn 1810]]

After the early explorations, the U.S. government sought to establish control of the region, since trade along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers was still dominated by British and French traders from Canada and allied [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]], especially the [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and [[Fox (tribe)|Fox]]. The U.S. adapted the former Spanish facility at [[Fort Bellefontaine]] as a fur trading post near St. Louis in 1804 for business with the Sauk and Fox.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Luttig|1920|p=}}.{{page needed|date= February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1808 two military forts with trading factories were built, [[Fort Osage]] along the [[Missouri River]] in western present-day Missouri and [[Fort Madison]] along the [[Upper Mississippi River]] in eastern present-day Iowa.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1969"&gt;{{harvp|Prucha|1969|p=}}.{{page needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With tensions increasing with Great Britain, in 1809 Fort Bellefontaine was converted to a U.S. military fort, and was used for that purpose until 1826.

During the [[War of 1812]], Great Britain and allied Indians defeated U.S. forces in the Upper Mississippi; the U.S. abandoned Forts Osage and Madison, as well as several other U.S. forts built during the war, including [[Fort Johnson]] and [[Fort Shelby (Wisconsin)|Fort Shelby]]. After U.S. ownership of the region was confirmed in the [[Treaty of Ghent]] (1814), the U.S. built or expanded forts along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, including adding to Fort Bellefontaine, and constructing [[Fort Armstrong, Illinois|Fort Armstrong]] (1816) and [[Warsaw, Illinois|Fort Edwards]] (1816) in Illinois, [[Fort Crawford]] (1816) in [[Prairie du Chien]] Wisconsin, [[Fort Snelling]] (1819) in Minnesota, and [[Fort Atkinson (Nebraska)|Fort Atkinson]] (1819) in Nebraska.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1969"/&gt;

==Financing==
The American government used $3 million in gold as a down payment, and issued bonds for the balance to pay France for the purchase. Earlier that year, [[Barings Bank|Francis Baring and Company]] of London had become the U.S. government's official banking agent in London. Because of this favored position, the U.S. asked the Baring firm to handle the transaction. Francis Baring's son [[Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton|Alexander]] was in Paris at the time and helped in the negotiations.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1988"&gt;{{harvp|Ziegler|1988|p=}}.{{page needed|date= February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Baring advantage was a close relationship with [[Hope &amp; Co.|Hope and Company]] of Amsterdam. The two banking houses worked together to facilitate and underwrite the Purchase.

Because Napoleon wanted to receive his money as quickly as possible, the two firms received the American bonds and shipped the gold to France.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1988"/&gt; Napoleon used the money to finance his [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|planned invasion of England]], which never took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fleming|2003|pp=129ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mishpat Ivri''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: משפט עברי, "Jewish/Hebrew law/jurisprudence") are the aspects of [[halakha]] ("traditional Jewish law") that are relevant to "non-religious" or "[[secular]]" law. In addition, the term refers to an academic approach to the Jewish legal tradition and a concomitant effort to apply that tradition to modern [[Israeli law]]. 

The academic study of ''Mishpat Ivri'' spans the full geographic, literary, and historical range of halakha. It tends to exclude certain areas of halakha that are not comparable to modern civil law, such as criminal law and "religious" law. 

{{Israelis}}
Subjects covered in ''Mishpat Ivri'' include:

# [[Property rights]] 
# [[Torts]], called [[Damages (Jewish law)|Damages]] in Jewish law
# [[Contracts]]
# [[Public law]]
# [[International law]]
# [[Sales]]
# [[Renting]] 
# [[Ownership]] 
# [[Negligence]] 
# [[Legal liability]]
# [[Copyright]] 

Within classical rabbinic Judaism, all ''Mishpat Ivri'' subjects are also subsumed under ''halakha'' (Jewish law in general). 

Scholars of ''Mishpat Ivri'' typically adopt methodologies based on [[legal positivism]]. Notably, [[Menachem Elon]] adopts a legal positivist approach in his extensive study (Elon 1994), which has been used to train Israeli law students at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. While useful for [[comparative law]] purposes, the legal positivist approach to ''Mishpat Ivri'' has been questioned by some scholars, such as [[Hanina Ben-Menahem]] and [[Bernard Jackson (professor)|Bernard Jackson]]. 

In the modern [[Israel|State of Israel]], ''Mishpat Ivri'' has become one of the lesser ongoing sources for contemporary Israeli [[Private law|civil law]], which developed along the model of British common law. (Israeli civil law was built primarily upon British and Ottoman law.) As an effort to promote Jewish law, the Mishpat Ivri movement has had relatively few gains, which include: (1) the Foundations of Law Act of 1980, allowing judicial reasoning to draw upon halakha, (2) the limited accretion of case law that refers to halakha, (3) occasional references to halakha in legislative deliberations, and (4) the placement of a Mishpat Ivri expert in the Attorney General's office, who has prepared bibliographies that document the references to halakha in Israel case law and legislation. The limited relevance of Mishpat Ivri to Israeli civil law may be contrasted with the dominant jurisdiction of rabbinic law courts in an Israeli marriage and divorce law.

The '''National Library of Serbia''' (NLS) ({{lang-sr|Народна библиотека Србије / Narodna biblioteka Srbije}}) is the [[national library]] of [[Serbia]], located in the capital city of [[Belgrade]]. It is the biggest library, and oldest institution in Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tob.rs/en/todo_in.php?id=628 The National Library of Serbia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140902134605/http://tob.rs/en/todo_in.php?id=628 |date=2 September 2014 }} at [[Tourist Organisation of Belgrade]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The establishment of the Library is connected to an historical event in February 1832, when Dimitrije Davidović, publisher of the first Serbian newspaper, sent a letter about establishing a national library in honour of Prince [[Miloš Obrenović]]. The same year in November, Prince Miloš ordered the [[Copyright deposit library|Legal Deposit]] of copies in the National Library.

During World War I, the Library building and collections were damaged by bombing, so the remaining holdings were moved from [[Belgrade]] to [[Niš]] and [[Kragujevac]] for their protection. After the War, and according to the National Library Act and the Press Law, both from 1919, the Library became the central state Library and obtained the right to acquire an obligatory copy from all over the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].

The bombing in the [[World War II]] by the [[Luftwaffe]] of the main country's Library in a city proclaimed officially [[Open city|open]] completely destroyed the Library building along with a book collection of 500.000 volumes, an invaluable collection of 1424 Cyrillic manuscripts and charters, a collection of old maps and prints of roughly 1,500 items, collections of 4,000 journals as well as 1,800 newspaper titles, its rich and irreplaceable archives of Turkish documents about Serbia and the complete correspondence of distinguished figures of the cultural and political history of Serbia, and all holdings lists and catalogs.

After the liberation of [[Belgrade]] in 1944, under the changed social conditions, there was a period of intensive reconstruction of the lost collections and rapid development of the Library. 
After the devoted work of the Library staff, the Library again opened its doors to the public in 1947. In 1954, on the 150th anniversary of the [[First Serbian Uprising]], the construction of a new building for the National Library was allowed, and the new Library building (Architect: Ivo Kurtović), was opened with a special ceremony on 6 April 1973. It is located in the [[Vračar]] municipality, sharing the naturally elevated plateau with [[Temple of Saint Sava]], as the highest peak of that part of Belgrade.

Nowadays, the National Library of Serbia is a modern national library. Its goals are: incorporation into the world’s information flows, recognition within the world’s family of national libraries, as well as becoming an information resource and drive for the development of Serbian society.

==Collections==
'''General collection''' includes: books printed after 1868 in Serbian and other [[ex-Yu]] languages and books printed after 1700 in foreign languages, periodicals from Serbia, ex-Yu and abroad, bibliographies, encyclopedias, lexicons, catalogs, dictionaries, directories in classical and electronic form, organized in an open access reference stock.

'''Special collections''' contain: old and rare books containing printed books in 18th and 19th century in languages of ex-Yu as well as foreign books up to 1700, bibliophile and miniature editions, literary and other manuscripts and archival documents, cartographic materials, printed music material and phonograms, photographic documents, engravings and picture material, placards and information materials, memorial libraries and legacies.

'''Manuscript collection''' includes: handwritten books from 12th to 18th century, mostly Serbian and small numbers of Bulgarian, Macedonian and Russian editions, [[incunabulum|incunabula]] and old Serbian printed books from 1494 to 1638, prints from old Serbian carved tablets from 16th to 18th century, microfilms of South Slavonic Cyrillic [[manuscript]]s.

==Digital NLS==
Digital library of the National Library of Serbia contains 1.2 million scanned pages in about 70 different collections (Cyrillic manuscripts, old and rare books, books, Serbian children's digital library, newspapers and magazines, cartographic materials, engravings and art material, photographic materials, posters and documentary material, printed music and sound records, catalogs and bibliographies, miscellaneous). NLS also participates in the several international projects such as [[World Digital Library]], with the goal of making Serbian digitised heritage accessible and searchable together with the cultural heritage of other countries. NLS is a partner of the project "Europeana Collections 1914-1918" and as a part of this project has published a thematic digital library ''Veliki rat'' (Great War) with valuable collections from [[World War I]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great War|url=http://velikirat.nb.rs/|website=Велики рат|publisher=National Library of Serbia|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconstruction==
The Reconstruction of the NLS Interior has been launched in 2007 and was ended in mid-2011, covering the following segments: the main entrance hall for users with exhibition space, the stairway of the entrance hall for users, the toilets at the ground floor and on floor, coffee bar with the kitchen, atrium, main hall on the floor level (floor, ceilings, lighting, information desks for users), all reading rooms at floor level, official entrance at the level of higher ground floor, hall and stairs, the apartment for foreign guests-researchers at the level of lower ground floor, the complete lighting of the NLS and the balconies for users at the level of the main hall and floors. The reconstructed area for the users was opened in September 2011, opening its doors to many existing and new users.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46455">'''Native American civil rights''' are the [[civil rights]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the United States.  Native Americans are citizens of their [[federally recognized tribes|clanic nations]] as well as the United States and those clanic nations are characterized under U.S.&amp;nbsp;law as "domestic dependent nations", a special relationship that creates a particular tension between rights retained via [[tribal sovereignty]] and rights that individual Natives obtained as [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;citizen]]s. This status creates tension today, but was far more extreme before Native people were uniformly granted U.S.&amp;nbsp;citizenship in 1924. Assorted laws and policies of the United States government, some tracing to the pre-Revolutionary [[European colonization of the Americas|colonial period]], denied basic [[human rights]]—particularly in the areas of cultural expression and travel—to indigenous people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanindiantah.com/history/cron_1871_1934.html|title=American Indian Civics Project: 1871 to 1924- Allotment and Assimilation|work=americanindiantah.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716021641/http://americanindiantah.com/history/cron_1871_1934.html|archivedate=2011-07-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it is difficult to summarize the [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|many tribes and peoples]] Native to the land that is now owned by the US, there are some rights that nearly all Native Americans are still actively pursuing. These include the protection of rights to voting and the resistance of assimilation to European American practices and beliefs. Many tribes that live on reservations are currently facing the destruction of surrounding environments and water sources, depressed economies, [[violence against women]], and drug and alcohol addiction crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/13-native-american-issues_us_55b7d801e4b0074ba5a6869c|title=13 Issues Facing Native People Beyond Mascots And Casinos|last=NoiseCat|first=Julian Brave|date=2015-07-30|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-contact with Europeans ==
Before colonization, millions of Native people lived in what is now considered North and South America. Indigenous peoples cultures, origins, religions, and languages are vastly diverse. The [[Oral history|histories]] of the tribes who have survived the [[Genocide of indigenous peoples#Colonialism and genocide in the Americas|genocide of Native Americans]] have mostly survived through [[Oral storytelling|oral story telling]] traditions.

Religious practices among Natives, pre-colonialism range from individual prayers, rituals, and offerings to large intertribal ceremonies. [[Pre-Columbian era|Precontact]] religion was often closely tied to the land, the environment.&lt;ref name="JUtter"&gt;Utter, Jack. ''American Indians: Answers to Today's Questions''. 2nd edition. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2001. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns include the omnipresent, invisible universal force, and "the three 'life crises' of birth, puberty, and death," spiritual beings, revelations, human intercessors into the spirit world, and ceremonies that renew communities.&lt;ref name="JUtter" /&gt;

== 1585-1786: Initial meetings ==
In [[1585]], a tribe on the eastern coast of North America interacted with the first English person to travel to the continent, [[Richard Grenville]]. The Native people were hospitable and receptive to Grenville. Yet, when one Native stole a small silver cup from him, Grenville sacked and burned down the entire village in revenge.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The People's History of the united States|last=Zinn|first=Howard|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2003|isbn=9780061965586|location=New York City|pages=12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1607, decades after this initial interaction, the English established [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], the first permanent English settlement on North America, in the middle of the [[Powhatan Confederacy|Powhatan confederacy]] in what is now [[Virginia]]. [[Powhatan (Native American leader)|Powhatan]], the leader, did not attack the English as they settled, though the English attacked the Powhatans upon meeting them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In the winter of 1609 through 1610, Jamestown residents had little food or effective shelter as they experienced the [[Starving Time]]. The Powhatan people integrated and cared for the English who left Jamestown to live with them, as they were much more prepared for the harsh winter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the summer, when the governor of Jamestown requested that Powhatan return the runaways, he offered vague comments that the English considered rude, but showed no intention to bring them back. In response, the English terrorized a local village, killing about 15 Powhatan, burning the houses down, cutting the corn supply, and kidnapping and murdering the queen and her children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Powhatans had never seen this magnitude of hatred before Jamestown's establishment; as the chief roughly said in a letter to [[Captain John Smith]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;I have seen two generations of my people die...I know the difference between peace and war better than any man in my country... Why will you take by force what you may have quietly by love? Why will you destroy us who supply you with food? What can you get by war? We can hide our provisions and run into the woods; then you will starve for wronging your friends. Why are you jealous of us? We are unarmed, and willing to give you what you ask, if you come in a friendly manner, and not so simple as not to know that is it much better to eat good meat, sleep comfortably, live quietly with my wives and children, laugh and be merry with the English, and trade for their copper and hatchets, than to run away from them, and to lie cold in the wood, feed on acorns, roots and such trash, and be so hunted that I can neither eat nor sleep... Take away your guns and swords, the cause of all our jealousy, or you my all die in the same manner.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Christianization and assimiliation===
English Europeans believed that their god was the only god to exist or that people were allowed to believe in. Many of them belived that it was their sacred duty to convert Native Americans as a religious practice to save their souls. The Christian Europeans who made the journey to the Americas believed it to be their duty to Christianize the Native people.&lt;ref&gt;Sale 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green, Leslie C. and Plive Patricia Dickason. ''The Law of Nations and the New World.'' pg. 173&lt;/ref&gt;  They felt it was their calling by God. Spaniards practiced Christianization in the New World using [[Pope Alexander VI]]'s papal bull, ''[[Inter caetera]]''. allowed rulers to "bring under their sway [non-Christian] 'countries and islands' discovered by Columbus, along with 'their residents and inhabitants, and to bring them to the Catholic faith.'"

The missionaries developed "praying towns" to create "orderly Christian communities filled with model converts who were living and working under the watchful eye of a priest or pastor".&lt;ref&gt;Ronda, James P. and Axtell, James. Indian Missions. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1978. p.29&lt;/ref&gt; Within these communities converts to the Christian faith would be placed in a separate area from the remainder of the tribe in order to prevent regression back to their Native beliefs. Missionaries such as [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]], a puritan, and [[Isaac McCoy]], a Baptist, led the way in the spread of their beliefs within these types of towns and amongst the Natives. These towns led the way to the future separation of the Natives from the remainder of society in [[Indian reservation|Native reservations]].

== 1787-1899:Creating the Constitution ==

==1900-1945==
=== Criticizing colonialism ===
Native peoples have been active in educating nonnatives on the cultures, histories, and experiences of their tribes since the beginning of colonization. Chief [[Plenty Coups]] of the [[Crow Nation|Crow Nation in Montana]] and [[Alfred Kiyana]] of the [[Mesquakie Settlement]] in Iowa spoke to historians, [[anthropologist]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and journalists through translators to criticize the idea of "American progress" and to express pride and faith in the identities of their own cultures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Native North American Almanac|last=Champagne|first=Duane|publisher=Gale Group|year=2001|isbn=0787616559|location=Farmington Hills, MI|pages=597-618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Eastman]], a Mdewakanton and Wahpeton Sioux and physician, published books and articles in [[English language|English]] for American people to show that it is not savage that Native people celebrate what [[Mourning dove|Mourning Dove]] called the "ancient way". In 1902, [[Gertrude Bonnin]] told the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' that the traditions of her tribe, the [[Yankton Dakota]] Sioux, were not only equal to European Americans, but that their values were superior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Involvement with US politics ===
In 1903, [[Charles Eastman]], a [[Santee Dakota|Santee Dakotan]] and Native representative, was requested by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to help Sioux people choose [[English name|English names]] in order to protect their lands from being taken. Lands registered with the birth and natural names of Natives were often lost due to confusion the United States government employees had with filling paperwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h3898.html|title=Ohiyesa, or Charles A. Eastman|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States government]] has a strong history making deals with Native Americans and not keeping them.Thomas Bishop, a [[Snohomish people|Snohomish]] man, recorded his elders' memories of U.S. promises and compared them to the actual texts in [[Native American treaties|treaties]]. He published a piece based on these discrepancies in 1915 titled "An Appeal to the Government to Fulfill Sacred Promises Made 61 Years Ago." Following this, he and other citizens of [[Pacific Northwest tribes]] organized all the [[Tulalip]] agency [[Indian reservation|reservations]] and several off-reservation communities into the [[Northwestern Federation of American Indians]] with the goal of redeeming promises made in treaties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Post World War II: 1946-1959 ==
Many [[Native Americans and World War II|Native Americans]] aided the United States in [[World War II]]. Veterans came back from serving, only to find that the US government and American people would not recognize their contributions to the war effort. This encouraged Natives to begin moving towards activism that was more focused on [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|tribal sovereignty]] and [[self-determination]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Advocacy groups, such as the [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI), which was founded in 1944, began representing tribal interests to the public and to [[United States Congress|Congress]]. The NCAI's founding members came from a wide variety of professionals including veterans, anthropologists, lawyers, elected state and federal officials, and a professional baseball player, George Eastman, and half of them had previously served on [[Indian Rights Association]]-chartered tribal councils. At least four of them were also members of the [[Society of American Indians]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Civil Rights Movement: 1960-1968 ==
In 1961, the [[National Indian Youth Council]] formed in pursuit of  "a greater Indian America". The organization members were young and had grown out of a summer program that brought students from all around the US to [[Boulder, Colorado]] and introduced to the [[Southwest Regional Indian Youth Council]] so that they could learn about the Native state of affairs. The organizations' members, people such as [[Clyde Warrior]], [[Melvin Thom]], [[Vine Deloria Jr.]], and [[Hank Adams]], rejected beliefs that Natives were unable to help themselves or that they needed to adopt American society as their own. They were seen as an upset to norms in the Native community, as they were much younger than other recognized leaders of Native civil rights movements. They emphasized [[Direct action|direct protest action]] and pursued [[federal recognition]] of several then-[[Unrecognized tribe|unrecognized Native nations]]. They also organized the first conference where unrecognized Native community members, tribal chiefs, and US chairpersons shared a public stage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Indian Civil Rights Act (1968)===
With the passage of the [[Indian Civil Rights Act]] (ICRA) in 1968, also called the Indian Bill of Rights, Native Americans were guaranteed many civil rights they had been fighting for.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. McCarthy, Civil Rights in Tribal Courts; The Indian Bill of Rights at 30 Years, 34 IDAHO LAW REVIEW 465 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; The ICRA supports the following:&lt;ref&gt;(Sokolow)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to [[free speech]], [[Freedom of press|press]], and [[Freedom of assembly|assembly]]
* Protection from unreasonable search and seizure
* Right of criminal defendant to a speedy trial, to be advised of the charges, and to confront any adverse witnesses
* Right to hire an attorney in a criminal case
* Protection against self incrimination
* Protection against [[cruel and unusual punishment]], excessive bail, incarceration of more than one year and/or a fine in excess of $5,000 for any one offense
* Protection from [[double jeopardy]] or ''[[ex post facto]]'' laws
* Right to a [[jury trial]] for offenses punishable by imprisonment
* Equal protection under the law and [[due process]]

Other civil rights such as [[sovereignty]], hunting and fishing, and voting are still issues facing Native people today.

== Contemporary movements (1969-present) ==
There has been increased dialogue around the controversy of using Native American symbols such as for school or team mascots. Concerns are that the use of the symbols distort Native American history and culture and often stereotype in offensive ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_indian_quarterly/v032/32.2hemmer.html|title=The American Indian Quarterly|last=Hofmann|first=Sudie|pages=156–177|volume=29, Number 1&amp;2, Winter/Spring 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of unequal schooling, the [[National Indian Education Association]] (NIEA) was formed to fight for equal education for Native Americans in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;http://seamonkey.ed.asu.edu/~mcisaac/emc598geold97/Spring97/5/eshel5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

Native American advocates went to the [[United Nations]] to seek laws that protected the rights of Native people to own their own media, and for the prosecution of those who persecuted their journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proquest.com|title=ProQuest - Databases, EBooks and Technology for Research|work=proquest.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious rights ==

===Religion after Euro-American contact===
Over the last five centuries, "Christianity has made enormous inroads into Native society."&lt;ref name="JUtter2"&gt;Utter, Jack. p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Many religious Native Americans today voluntarily practice Christianity, both Protestantism and Roman Catholicism, or a combination of Christianity and Native religion.&lt;ref name="JUtter2"/&gt; There was both voluntary and forced conversion; however, not all tribes embraced Christianity, nor did all members of tribes.

"Euro-American contact and interactions contributed much to Indian marginality and the disruption and destruction of traditional customs and even the aboriginal use of psychoactive substances. This process was noted in the 1976 Final Report to the American Indian Policy Review Commission, Task Force Eleven: Alcohol and Drug Abuse.&lt;ref&gt;French, Laurence Armand. ''Addictions &amp; Native Americans.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000. p 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]] was passed in 1978. It allowed freedom of religion except for some restrictions on use of ceremonial items as the eagle feathers or bones (a protected species) or [[peyote]] (considered a restricted drug by the federal government);&lt;ref&gt;Enumeration of areas of conflict from Francis Paul Prucha. ''The Great Father: The United States Government and the American Indians, Volume 2''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1984, p. 1127&lt;/ref&gt; however, other laws provide for ceremonial use of these by Native American religious practitioners.

One example of Christianity's influence on Native American religion is the prominence of the figure of Jesus Christ in peyote ceremonies of the [[Native American Church]],&lt;ref&gt;Woodhead, Linda. ''Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations.'' New York: Routledge, 2002. p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] religion.

Many indigenous religions arose in response to colonization. These include the [[Longhouse Religion]], which arose at the end of the 18th century, and the [[Ghost Dance]], [[Four Mothers Society]], [[Indian Shaker Church]], [[Kuksu religion]], and others in the 19th century.

===Suppression during the Progressive Era===
During the [[Progressive Era]] from the 1890s to the 1920s, a "quasi-theocracy" reigned in what federal policymakers called "Indian Country"; they worked hand-in-hand with churches to impose Christianity upon Native Americans "as part of the government's civilizing project".&lt;ref name="BDuthu"&gt;Duthu, N. Bruce. ''American Indians and the Law''. New York: Viking, 2008. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping in the vein of the colonialists before them, Progressive-Era policymakers found no need to separate religious endeavors concerning Native Americans from Native political policy.&lt;ref name=FHoxie&gt;Hoxie, Frederick E., ed. Talking Back to Civilization: Indian Voices from the Progressive Era. Boston: Bedford. 2001. p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The government provided various religious groups with funds to accomplish Native American conversion. It was during this time that the government "discouraged or imposed bans on many forms of traditional religious practices, including the [[Sun Dance]], use of [[peyote]] in ceremonial settings and observance of [[potlatch]] rituals."&lt;ref name="BDuthu"/&gt; The [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA), or the "Indian Office", as it was then called, played a role in the Christianization of Native Americans. Their boarding schools, often staffed by missionaries, removed Native children from the tribe and away from the influence of their cultures.&lt;ref name="BDuthu"/&gt;

In order to pacify Christians, "some tribal religious practitioners modified elements of their traditional practices".&lt;ref name="BDuthu2"&gt;Duthu, N. Bruce. ibid. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the Sun Dance, "a ceremony of renewal and spiritual reaffirmation", some tribes "omit[ted] the element of self-sacrifice (many participants observed the ritual of skin piercing), reduced the number of days for the ceremony from eight to two and otherwise emphasized the ceremony's social, rather than religious, features".&lt;ref name="BDuthu2"/&gt; In the past, tribes have also moved religious days to coincide with national U.S.&amp;nbsp;holidays.

Until 1935, Native American people could be fined and sent to prison for practicing certain traditional religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/wicazo_sa_review/v021/21.2talbot.html|title=Wicazo Sa Review|last=Talbot|first=Steve|pages=7–39|volume=21, Number 2, Fall 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary Native American religious issues===
Established in 1918, the Native American Church "emphasiz[ed] the importance of monogamy, sobriety, and hard work".&lt;ref&gt;Hoxie, Frederick E. ibid. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it serves as an intertribal, multilingual network. The Native American Church has had a long struggle with the government of America due to their ancient and deeply spiritual religious practice using [[peyote]]. Peyote is a psychoactive substance that is found on a cactus and it is used for healing practices and in religious ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Young, William A. Quest for Harmony. Seven Bridges P, LLC, 2001. p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; The use of this subject is highly debated due to the outbreaks of drug use especially the psychoactive ones among Americans today. Leaders of the Native American Church argue that the use of peyote allows for a direct connection with gods and that peyote is not taken simply for its psychoactive effects. It is taken in the manner that one might take the sacraments of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Catherine M. ''Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions.'' Oxford University Press: New York, 1997. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; "Peyote is not habit forming and 'in the controlled ambiance of a peyote meeting it is in no way harmful'" Rather it is considered a unifying influence on the Native American life because it provides the "basis for Indian friendships, rituals, social gatherings, travel, marriage, and more. It has been a source of healing and means of expression for a troubled people. And it has resulted in one of the strongest pan-Indian movements among American Indians".&lt;ref&gt;Young, William A. Quest for Harmony. Seven Bridges P, LLC, 2001. p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

For years the government has been debating the subject of peyote use.  In 1949 peyote use was condemned by the [[American Medical Association]] because findings in their study led them to believe that it was habit-forming drug. Congress then attempted to regulate the use of peyote in 1963 with little success, but under the [[Drug Abuse Control Act]] in 1965 it was on the list of forbidden psychedelic drugs. Under this act it did not place this on Native American peyotists who were using it for religious practice, though some suffered still under the hands of the state governments for having it in their possession. State laws differed from the United States government standards with states outlawing the use of peyote.&lt;ref&gt;Young, William A. Quest for Harmony. Seven Bridges P, LLC, 2001. p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; "By 1970, of the seventeen states that still had anti-peyote laws, only five did not provide exemptions for Indians to use peyote ritually." These were amended under the pressure from the [[Native American Church]] member if the members showed proof that they were at least 25&amp;nbsp;percent Native American. The states laws were generally similar to those of [[South Dakota]], which says that "when used as a sacrament in services of the Native American Church in a natural state which is unaltered except for drying or curing or slicing", peyote use is permitted.&lt;ref&gt;La Barre, Weston. The Peyote Cult. Archon Books, 1973. p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]] there was mention of protection for peyote users, but this did not change the fact that they could still be charged. Because it is an "established religion of many centuries' history...not a 20th&amp;nbsp;century [[cult]] nor a fad subject to extinction at a whim",&lt;ref&gt;Botsford and EchoHawk 1996, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; it continues to be somewhat protected under the law.

==Sovereignty==
{{Main|Tribal sovereignty in the United States}}
All [[Native American tribes]] are under the U.S. government just as other minority groups. However, unlike other minority groups who are immigrants to the United States, Native Americans are indigenous to American land and have therefore sought and gained [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref name="Wildenthal, Bryan H 2003"&gt;Wildenthal, Bryan H. Native American sovereignty on trial: a handbook with cases, laws, and documents. Santa Barbara, California. ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Native sovereignty is made complex by the fact that the British (in colonial times) and American government also co-exist in the same country.&lt;ref name="airpi2005"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.airpi.org/index.html |title=American Indian Policy Center |access-date=2008-12-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225175315/http://www.airpi.org/index.html |archive-date=2008-12-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Native American "government" is not government in the western sense of authority and control, but is more like leadership over a community.&lt;ref name="airpi2005"/&gt;  It is difficult to describe Native American government in a definite manner due to the fact that there are many different Native tribes with different forms of governing. As of January 2016, there are 566 [[Federally recognized tribes|federally recognized]]&amp;nbsp;Native American tribes.&lt;ref name="Wildenthal, Bryan H 2003" /&gt; During the colonial period, Native American sovereignty was upheld by the negotiation of treaties between British proprietor and Native American tribes. Treaties are agreements between two sovereign governments, and, therefore, the treaties made were made under the understanding that the tribes had equal sovereignty to the sovereignty of the colonial governments. The signing of treaties ended with the [[Indian Appropriations Act#1871|Indian Appropriations Act of 1871]], which preserved the same rights and privileges, but changed recognition to "domestinanic dependent nations" rather than independent nations.

==Fishing and hunting rights==
Although Native Americans lost the battle for their lands, the US government eventually conceded hunting and fishing rights both within the reservations and on old tribal land that had been sold to and settled. The reserved rights doctrine allowed for tribes to hunt and fish, along with any other rights, as long as they were not specifically denied in a treaty. This angered hunters and fishers who had restrictions placed on them by the government and they protested against the Natives' right to fish and hunt off of reservations. 

As the United States government pushed to colonize as much of North America as they could, they began making treaties with tribes, so that they may have reservations of land. One particular treaty with the [[Yakama]] in the Northwest guarantees that the tribe has the rights to "taking fish at all usual and accustomed places in common with the citizens of the Territory".&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Association|volume=443|page=658|pin=|year=1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1890s, Lineas and Audubon Winans operated a state-licensed fishing mill in [[Celilo Falls|Celio Falls]], an important place for fishing to not only the Yakama, but also the [[Umatilla people|Umatilla]] and the [[Nez Perce people|Nez Perce]]. The Winans decided to develop a [[fish wheel]] to catch [[salmon]] by the tons, which would deplete the river of fish for the Natives very quickly. In addition, the Winans purchased land that made it impossible for Native people to approach the river at all. The Yakama took this case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[United States v. Winans]]'' (1905) and won the rights to fish and to have treaties interpreted by the US government as the members of tribes would have interpreted them at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Duthu, N. Bruce (2008). ''American Indians and the Law: The Penguin Library of American Indian History'' p.101. Penguin Group (USA). {{ISBN|0-670-01857-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State agencies pointed out that conservation efforts were possibly compromised by the Native Americans' habits; however the Supreme Court upheld the privilege with certain cases, such as ''[[Antoine v. Washington]]'' (1975), even going so far as to appropriate for Native Americans the right to hunt and fish on all of their old grounds whether or not they were currently privately owned, and to prevent private owners from erecting obstacles to exercising this right. The largest amount of opposition and resentment towards Native Americans' fishing and hunting rights stems from the Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref&gt;Law Encyclopedia. West's Encyclopedia of American Law. Copyright © 1998 by The Gale Group, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1988, the United States government passed a federal [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]], which provides the legislative basis for protecting Native lands for their community health and economic growth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Traveling rights==
During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the U.S.&amp;nbsp;government attempted to control the travel of Native Americans off Native reservations.  Since Native Americans did not obtain U.S. citizenship until 1924, they were considered wards of the state and were denied various basic rights, including the right to travel.&lt;ref&gt;''Heartbeat of the People:  Music and Dance of the Northern Pow-Wow'', Browner&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) discouraged off-reservation activities, including the right to hunt, fish, or visit other tribes. As a result, the BIA instituted a "pass system" designed to control movement of the Natives.  This system required Natives living on reservations to obtain a pass from a Native agent before they could leave the reservation.&lt;ref&gt;In a Barren Land:  American Indian Dispossession and Survival, Marks&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, agents were often ordered to limit the number of passes they issued for off-reservation travel. The reasons cited for this limitation were that Natives with passes often overstayed the time limits imposed, and many times Natives left without requesting passes.  When this occurred, the military was frequently called to force the Natives to return their reservations. For example, in April 1863, Superintendent J.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;Perit Huntington forced 500&amp;nbsp;Native Americans to return from the [[Willamette Valley]] who had violated the pass system, and estimated that up to 300&amp;nbsp;Natives were still in the area without US authorization.&lt;ref&gt;''Indians of the Pacific Northwest'', Elizabeth von Aderkas&lt;/ref&gt;

While attempting to implement this pass system, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) received numerous complaints regarding Natives who traveled without permission. Many complained that Native Americans were killing game merely for the sport and were taking the hides. Other settlers complained that Natives overstayed their visits at neighboring reservations while neglecting their farming duties at home. For example, in December, 1893, Governor [[John E. Osborne]] of [[Wyoming]] wrote a letter to the BIA protesting that Natives from [[Fort Hall Indian Reservation|Fort Hall]], [[Lemhi Shoshone|Lemhi]], [[Wind River Indian Reservation|Wind River]], and [[Crow Indian Reservation|Crow Reservations]] were leaving illegally. In response, the commissioner sent a note to all Native agents stating that Natives who disobeyed the pass system would be arrested and punished by state officials.&lt;ref&gt;''The Northern Shoshoni'', Madsen, 134&lt;/ref&gt; Additional rules were also implemented at this time.  For example, the Native agents were now required to notify other reservations of the departure time of Natives, names of Natives, and the route they intended to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard University, U.S. Office of Indian Affairs, 67&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these concerns, many settlers were unhappy with the travel of Native Americans on the railroads. For example, the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] in [[Nevada]] had granted Natives the privilege of riding on the roof and flatbeds of rail cars without tickets, in exchange for the right-of-way through their reservations.&lt;ref&gt;As Long as the River Shall Run, Knack, 103,&lt;/ref&gt; Other railroad lines, including the Carson and the Colorado allowed free railroad travel to the Natives. [[Paiute]]{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2018}} Natives, for example, frequently rode the trains to their traditional hunting and fishing grounds. "Paiutes would pack up their gathering baskets and hop on the rails, take off a day or two to gather seeds, and bring their harvest back home again, on the car roofs. Men and women used free passes to travel into town or to ranches farther in the hinterlands for jobs."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''As Long as the River Shall Run'', Knack, 103&lt;/ref&gt; Angry Native agents, who wanted the Paiutes to stay under their jurisdiction, wrote letters urging the BIA to stop this free travel. According to one Native agent, "The injurious effects of this freedom from restraint, and continual change of place, on the Indian, can not be overestimated."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

The loss of the right to free movement across the country was difficult for Native Americans, especially since many tribes traditionally traveled to hunt, fish, and visit other tribes.  The passage of the [[Indian Citizenship Act]] in 1924 granted citizenship to all Natives born in America.  As a result, Native Americans were finally granted free travel in the United States. At the present time, Native Americans who live on reservations are free to travel as they wish.

== Voting ==
In the 18th century, starting when the Constitution was created, There was a struggle to define what the Native tribes relationship was with the United States. Article;1, Section;2 of the Constitution states that Natives are not under any control of the United States, and therefore cannot be taxed. (Daniel, Susan M. Olson, and Jennifer L. Robinson. Native Vote).&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2007. pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution also stated that Congress has the power to "regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among several states, and with Indian tribes" as stated in Article;I, Section;8. 

The [[Marshall Trilogy]] in 1831 helped define sovereignty by stating that the Cherokee nation was a distinct political society but a domestic dependent nation and one that "resembles that of a ward to a guardian".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]'' (1831)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Native Americans' relationship to the U.S.&amp;nbsp;government was similar to that of people in an occupied land under the control of a foreign power.&lt;ref name="McCool 2"&gt;McCool 2&lt;/ref&gt; This definition meant that Native people did not have a right to vote. Further clarification was made when in 1856 Attorney General [[Caleb Cushing]] stated, "Indians are the subjects of the United States, and therefore are not, in mere right of home-birth, citizens of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Official Opinions of the Attorneys General 1856, 749–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCool 2" /&gt;

In 1817 the Cherokee became the first Native Americans recognized as U.S.&amp;nbsp;citizens. Under Article&amp;nbsp;8 of the 1817 Cherokee treaty, "Upwards of 300&amp;nbsp;Cherokees (Heads of Families) in the honest simplicity of their souls, made and election to become American citizens."&lt;ref name="McLoughlin"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth&amp;nbsp;Amendment]] and the first civil rights act were passed in 1866 regarding the role of African-Americans in the United States, citizenship of Natives was defined as well. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 states, "That all persons born in the United States, and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States".&lt;ref name="McCool 3"&gt;McCool 3&lt;/ref&gt; The country at this time was not necessarily ready for Natives to become citizens. Senator [[Jacob Howard]] of Michigan commented, "I am not yet prepared to pass a sweeping act of naturalization by which all the Indian savages, wild or tame, belonging to a tribal relation, are to become my fellow-citizens and go to the polls and vote with me…".&lt;ref name="CG 1866, 2895"&gt;Congressional Globe 1866, 2895&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCool 3" /&gt; This sentiment is also shown through a Senate floor debate regarding the Fourteenth Amendment where [[James Rood Doolittle]] of Wisconsin stated, "…all those wild Natives to be citizens of the United States, the Great Republic of the world, whose citizenship should be a title as proud as that of king, and whose danger is that you may degrade that citizenship."&lt;ref name="CG 1866, 2892"&gt;Congressional Globe 1866, 2892&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCool 3" /&gt; One of his other concerns was that because of the substantial number of Natives at the time, their numbers would be able to overwhelm the power of the white vote.&lt;ref name="McCool 3" /&gt; As Doolittle argued, "there is a large mass of the Indian population who are clearly subject to the jurisdiction of the United States who ought not to be included as citizens of the United States…the word "citizen," if applied to them, would bring in all the Digger Indians of California".&lt;ref name="CG 1866, 2892" /&gt;

While not all Natives were granted citizenship at that time under a blanket law, there were some special considerations made to grant individual Natives citizenship. This in turn gave them the right of suffrage. For example, a treaty involving the United States and the [[Lakota people]] demonstrates this. In 1868 Article&amp;nbsp;6 of the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]] stated that Natives could gain citizenship by "receiving a patent for land under the foregoing provisions… and be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of such citizens, and shall, at the same time retain all [their] rights to benefits accruing to Indians under this treaty".&lt;ref name="McCool 5"&gt;McCool 5&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of this was that the Natives could become citizens yet still maintain their status and rights as Natives.&lt;ref name="McCool 5" /&gt;

Even for signatory Native Nations to the Fort Laramie Treaty, however, it was made clear though that just because a few Natives were citizens, it did not mean that they all in turn had the right to vote. In 1884, when John Elk, a Native who lived in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], attempted to register in local elections, he was refused a ballot. When he took the case to Supreme Court and through the ''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]'' trial, he was ruled against under the circumstances that Natives did not fall under the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;ref name="McCool 6"&gt;McCool 6&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Dawes Act]] in 1887 continued to pave the pathway for Native citizenship in that members of certain Native American tribes who accepted an allotment of land was considered a citizen.&lt;ref name="McCool 6" /&gt; The goal was for Natives to, through assimilation, "adopt the habits of civilized life".&lt;ref&gt;Keyssar, Alexander. The Right to Vote. New York: Basic Books, 2000. pg. 165&lt;/ref&gt; This movement certainly convinced a lot of Natives to gain citizenship. This is seen through President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s statement on the allotment policy in which he reported that by 1901, 60,000&amp;nbsp;Natives had already become citizens of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Roosevelt 1901, 6672&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCool 6" /&gt;

Piece by piece, more acts were created that added Natives to the citizenship rolls.&lt;ref name="McCool 6"/&gt; When the Native Territory (what is now Oklahoma) was abolished in 1907, all Natives who lived in that territory were made citizens through the [[Oklahoma Enabling Act]].&lt;ref name="McCool 6" /&gt;

Furthermore, after [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]], any Native who had fought with [[honorable discharge]] was also considered a citizen through the Act of November 6, 1919.&lt;ref name="McCool 7"&gt;McCool 7&lt;/ref&gt; As Native Vote states, "The underlying assumption of this act was that these particular Indians had demonstrated that they had become part of the larger Anglo culture and were no longer wholly Indian".&lt;ref name="McCool 7" /&gt;

By the early 1920s, Congress was considering a bill to make the remainder of Native Americans citizens in their aim to have them "adopt Anglo culture".&lt;ref name="McCool 7"/&gt; This finally was stated with the [[Indian Citizenship Act]] which was created on June 2, 1924. This act showed progress in that Natives would not have to give up being a Native to be a citizen of the United States. This included being an enrolled member of a tribe, living on a federally recognized reservation, or practicing his or her culture.&lt;ref name="McCool 7" /&gt; However, this did not create the right to vote automatically.

There remained instances in many states that still prevented Natives from voting, even though they were citizens of the United States. For example, the attorney general of [[Colorado]] in 1936 declared that Natives could not vote because they were not citizens of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen 1942, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCool 9&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, states found ways around voting in other ways. Because the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] 1870 barred states from limiting voting on account of race, states found other ways – residency: claiming that Native Americans were not residents of the state if they resided on reservations, self-termination: one must first abandon their tribal ties in order to vote, taxation: Natives who do not need to pay taxes cannot vote, guardianship: the claim that Native Americans were incompetent and "wards of the state", and on the lack of ability to read English.&lt;ref name="McCool 19"&gt;McCool 19&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] and the need for more soldiers through the draft, Congress reaffirmed Native people's citizenship with the Nationality Act of 1940.&lt;ref name="ITCA 2"&gt;ITCA 2&lt;/ref&gt; However, when some 25,000 veterans returned home after the war, they realized that even though they had put their lives on the line for their country, they were still not allowed to vote.&lt;ref name="ITCA 2" /&gt;

In 1965 the [[Voting Rights Act]] (VRA) put an end to individual states' claims on whether or not Natives were allowed to vote through a federal law. Section&amp;nbsp;2 of the VRA states that, "No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure, shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color".&lt;ref&gt;McCool 22&lt;/ref&gt; Further sections describe the measures taken if violations to this act are discovered.

However, efforts by states and municipalities to disenfranchise Native Americans are ongoing, such that there have been about 74&amp;nbsp;cases brought by or on behalf of Natives under the VRA or the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] or Fifteenth Amendment since 1965.&lt;ref&gt;McCool 45&lt;/ref&gt; These in the most part have proved to be successful to upholding the rights of Native Americans as citizens of the United States. Most of these cases are centered on states that have large reservations, or Native populations, such as New Mexico, Arizona and Oklahoma.

== Land rights ==
{{main|Aboriginal title in the United States}}
One of the major issues surrounding land ownership rights of the Native American Nations is for what they are and are not allowed to use their land.

A typical example of the struggle faced involved the [[Seneca Nation]] of [[New York State]]. On April 18, 2007, the Seneca Nation laid claim to a stretch of [[Interstate&amp;nbsp;90]] that crosses the [[Cattaraugus Reservation]] by revoking the 1954 agreement that granted the [[Interstate Highway System]] and [[New York State Thruway Authority]] permission to build the highway through the territory. The move was a direct shot at New York Governor [[Eliot Spitzer]]'s attempts to collect taxes on Seneca territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffalonews.com/101/story/57227.html Buffalo News story]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Senecas had previously made the same claim in a lawsuit which they lost because of the state's assertion of sovereign immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.upstate-citizens.org/Seneca-v-NYS-tway.pdf |title=United States Court of Appeals - Seneca Nation v. State of New York |access-date=2008-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808172704/http://www.upstate-citizens.org/Seneca-v-NYS-tway.pdf |archive-date=2007-08-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Magistrate Heckman's Report and Recommendation it was noted that the State of New York asserted its immunity from suit against both counts of the complaint (one count was the challenge regarding the state's acquisition of [[Grand Island, New York|Grand Island]] and other smaller islands in the [[Niagara River]] and another count challenging the thruway easement).  The United States was permitted to intervene on behalf of the Seneca Nation and the [[Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians]]. The United States was then directed to file an amended complaint that "clearly states the relief sought by the United States in this action". In this amended complaint the United States did not seek any relief on behalf of the Seneca Nation relative to the thruway easement. By not seeking such relief in its amended complaint the United States of America permitted the action relative to the thruway easement to be subject to dismissal based on New York's immunity from suit under the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]] to the United States Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upstate-citizens.org/Tway-RR-and-Dist-Ct-decisions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 4, the Seneca Nation threatened to do the same with [[Interstate 86 (east)|Interstate&amp;nbsp;86]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salamancapress.com/site/tab1.cfm?newsid=18301123&amp;BRD=2725&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=562848&amp;rfi=6 Salamanca Press article]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person is guilty of '''obstructing government administration''' if the person intentionally interferes by force, [[violence]] or [[intimidation]] or by any physical act with a public servant performing or purporting to perform an official function. This goes for the obstruction of any police officer, constable, sheriff’s deputy, conservation ranger, state trooper, detective, or any EMT or other authorized medical technician or firefighter with violence or force during the performance of their duties. Also it is a felony for any person to interfere with any government official such as any duly sworn law enforcement official such as any police officer, prison guard, corrections officer, conservation ranger, marshal, sheriff’s deputy, jailer, or probation officer by the expelling or throwing of human or animal urine, feces, blood, vomitus, or seminal fluid on him or her while engaging in the performance of his or her official duties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4125">The '''Open Wireless Movement''' hosted at '''OpenWireless.org''' is an [[Internet activism]] project which seeks to increase [[Internet access]] by encouraging people and organizations to configure or install software on their own [[wireless router]] to offer a separate public guest network or to make a single public [[wireless access point]]. If many people did this, then a ubiquitous global public [[wireless network]] would be created which would achieve and surpass the goal of increasing Internet access. The project was initiated in November 2012 by a coalition of ten advocacy groups including the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF), [[Fight for the Future]], [[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]], [[Internet Archive]], [[NYCwireless]], [[Open Garden]], [[OpenITP]], the [[Open spectrum|Open Spectrum]] Alliance, the [[Open Technology Institute]], and the [[Personal Telco Project]].&lt;ref name="nycwireless"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nycwireless.net/2012/11/27/share-your-network-join-new-open-wireless-movement/ |title=Share Your Network–Join New Open Wireless Movement |last1=Spiegel |first1=Dana |date=2012-11-27 |website=NYCwireless |access-date=2016-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EFF representative Adi Kamdar commented, "We envision a world where sharing one's Internet connection is the norm.

A '''political pensioner''' enjoys a [[pension]] awarded due to his or political career or significance.

== UK domestic politicians ==
{{outdated|section|date=September 2018}}
By the [[Political Offices Pension Act 1869]], pensions were instituted for those who had held political office. For the purposes of the act, political offices were divided into three classes:
# those with a yearly salary of not less than £5,000; 
# those with a salary of less than £5,000 and not less than £2,000;
# those with a salary of less than £2,000 and more than £1,000.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Pension |volume=21 |page=120 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For service in these offices there may be awarded pensions for life in the following scale: 
# a first class pension not exceeding £2,000 a year, in respect of not less than four years service or its equivalent, in an office of the first class; 
# a second class pension not exceeding £1,200, in respect of service of not less than six years or its equivalent, in an office of the second class; 
# a third class pension not exceeding £800 a year, in respect of service of not less than ten years in an office of the third class.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The service need not be continuous, and the act makes provision for counting service in lower classes as a qualification for pension in a higher class. These pensions are limited in number to twelve, but a holder must not receive any other pension out of the public revenue, if so, he must inform the treasury and surrender it if it exceeds his political pension, or if under he must deduct the amount. He may, however, hold office while a pensioner, but the pension is not payable during the time he holds office. To obtain a political pension, the applicant must file a declaration stating the grounds upon which he claims it and that his income from other sources is not sufficient to maintain his station in life.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

== Colonial ==
{{Princely states topics}}
These pensions were not awarded on grounds of justice, contract or socio-economic merits, but as a political decision, in order to take a politically significant person and/or his dynasty (often deemed a potential political danger) out of the picture by paying him or her off, regardless of seniority. 

In the history of the [[British Empire]], the term applies to the following overseas native former ruling houses of [[princely state]]s who saw their feudal territories annexed by the [[East India Company]] before it transferred power in [[British India]] to [[the Crown]] in 1858.

Although politically important members could be relocated or exiled, they retained throughout India and until the end of the [[British Raj|Raj]] a hereditary right to their former princely rank and titles (in several cases including a [[gun salute]]) as well as a monetary "political pension" in the form of a [[Privy Purse in India|privy purse]]. Only a few years after India's independence in 1947, the nationalist government of the Indian Union 'persuaded' most of these princely heirs to relinquish their annual pensions on so-called patriotic grounds. For those who continued to receive the payments, the sums were reduced to a pittance through not compensating for inflation.

Muslim pensioners :
* the imperial [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] family, [[Paramount ruler]] of India as [[Padshah-i-Hind]], in or near Delhi (pension discontinued after 1857)
* the heirs of its failed Muslim fundamentalist challenger, [[Tippu Sultan]]'s Mysore-based [[Khudadad]] empire 
* the [[Prince of Arcot]] (formerly Nawab Subadar of the Realm of the Carnatic)
* the [[Nawab of Awadh]] (Oudh), formerly the Mughal emperor's hereditary prime Minister 
* the Nawab of [[Kurnool]] 
* the [[Nawab of Masulipatam]], head of a younger branch of the [[nawabs of Banganapalle]]
* the [[Nawab of Murshidabad]] (in fact the dynasty of the former Nawab Nazim of greater [[Bengal]]; in West Bengal)
* the [[Nawab of Surat]]

Seven Hindu thrones, at least three held by the Rajput Bhonsle family :
* the Maharaja of [[Assam]] (not the whole present constitutive state) 
* the Maharaja of [[Nagpur]] 
* the Raja of [[Kolaba State|Kolaba]], Angria (Angre) dynasty
* the Raja of [[Satara State|Satara]], had even earlier lost all real power to his chief minister, the [[Peshwa]], who had become the hegemon of the [[Maratha Empire|Mahratta confederation]]
* the Raja of [[Tanjore]]
* the Raja of [[Kodagu|Coorg]] 
* the Peshwa of the Maratha Confederacy (pension discontinued 1857)

Only one Sikh pensioner : 
* [[Sikh Empire|Punjab]]'s last ruling Maharajah, [[Duleep Singh]].

== Other ==
Similar 'golden cage' arrangements were often made later by other (not only British) governments. An extreme case was the French Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], for whom the Italian island of [[Elba]] was turned into an operetta 'empire' until his escape, Cent Jours revolt and miserable banishment to St. Helena.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9295">'''Preventive police''' is that aspect of [[law enforcement]] intended to act as a deterrent to the commission of crime. Preventive policing is considered a defining characteristic of the modern police, typically associated with [[Robert Peel]]'s [[Metropolitan Police Service|London Metropolitan Police]], established in 1829.

== Historical development in the UK ==
=== Reliance upon executions ===
{{See|Bloody Code}}

In the century following 1688, severe punishment was the legal mechanism in [[England]] for preventing crime, which included the designations of hundreds of crimes as [[capital crime]]s, punishable by death. Public executions were part of the formula, designed to deter criminals by demonstrating the brutal consequences of crime if apprehended.

Reformers argued that this method of prevention was ineffective, advocating instead punishments that, in the mind of the criminal, fit the crime.&lt;ref name="Marin"&gt;R. J. Marin, "The Living Law." In eds., W. T. McGrath and M. P. Mitchell, ''The Police Function in Canada''. Toronto: Methuen, 1981, 18-19. {{ISBN|0-458-93920-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Police Magistrate [[John Fielding]], head of the [[Bow Street Runners]], believed that "It is much better to prevent even one man from being a rogue than apprehending and bringing forty to justice." Fielding's Bow Street "thief takers", however, were a stipendiary force, and were primarily relegated to policing crime after it was committed.&lt;ref name="Marin"/&gt; Despite the introduction of the Bow Street Runners and other paid professionals, private citizens were still overwhelmingly responsible for initiating criminal charges against culprits. Research suggests this reliance on the public to exercise [[Judicial discretion]] may have put immigrant groups such as the Irish at a disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How Criminal were the Irish? Bias in the Detection of London Currency Crime, 1797-1821|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03058034.2016.1270876|journal = The London Journal|date = 2017-02-09|doi = 10.1080/03058034.2016.1270876|first = Adam|last = Crymble}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In practice ===
The practical application of the concept in the English policing system is attributed to [[Patrick Colquhoun]], who presented his ideas in ''A Treatise on the Police of the Metropolis'' (1797). Colquhoun founded the [[Marine Police Force|Thames River Police]] to counter the significant losses from the theft of cargo being shipped in and out of the [[Port of London]] on the [[River Thames]].

In contrast to the Bow Street Runners, the river police acted as a deterrent by their continual presence on the riverfront, in addition to being able to intervene if they spotted a crime in progress. The Thames River Police and the Bow Street Runners were absorbed into the Metropolitan Police in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew T. Harris, ''[http://www.ohiostatepress.org/Books/Book%20PDFs/Harris%20Policing.pdf  Policing the City: Crime and Legal Authority in London, 1780-1840] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927062752/http://www.ohiostatepress.org/Books/Book%20PDFs/Harris%20Policing.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}'' [[PDF]]. Columbus, OH: Ohio State University Press, 2004, 6. {{ISBN|0-8142-0966-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Utilitarianism calculations ===
Colquhoun was influenced by the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] ideas of his colleague, [[Jeremy Bentham]], who helped make the case for the establishment of the river police. On the subject of policing, Bentham promoted the views of [[Italy|Italian]] [[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria|Marquis Cesare Beccaria]], and disseminated a translated version of "Essay on Crime in Punishment".

Beccaria placed preventive policing in terms consistent with Bentham's own beliefs, espousing the guiding principle of "the greatest good for the greatest number", which Bentham used as the foundation of his utilitarian philosophy:
::&lt;blockquote&gt;''It is better to prevent crimes than to punish them. This is the chief aim of every good system of legislation, which is the art of leading men to the greatest possible happiness or to the least possible misery, according to calculation of all the goods and evils of life.''&lt;ref name="Marin"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An 1829 ''London Review'' article entitled, "Preventive police" caught the attention of Jeremy Bentham, and began his mentoring relationship with its author, [[Edwin Chadwick]], that would last until Bentham's death in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;Marjie Bloy, "[http://www.victorianweb.org/history/chad1.html  Edwin Chadwick (1800-1890)]," The Victorian Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Chadwick's article contributed to the debate leading up to [[Robert Peel]]'s proposal for a metropolitan police force.

He argued that prevention ought to be the ''primary'' concern of a police body, which was not the case in practice. The reason, argued Chadwick, was that "A preventive police would act more immediately by placing difficulties in obtaining the objects of temptation." In contrast to a deterrent of punishment, a preventive police force would deter criminality by making crime cost-ineffective, anticipating the "crime doesn't pay" motto promoted by American police reformers in the 20th century.

Not only would a preventive police trump punishment as a deterrent, it would also reduce the costs of a criminal justice system over-burdened by prosecuting crimes that have already been committed.&lt;ref&gt;E. Chadwick, "A Preventive Police," ''The London Review'', 1829, vol. i, pp. 271-272.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second draft of his 1829 Police Act, the "object" of the new Metropolitan Police, was changed by Robert Peel to the "principal object", which was the "prevention of crime".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in H. S. Cooper, "The Evolution of Canadian Police." In eds., W. T. McGrath and M. P. Mitchell, ''The Police Function in Canada''. Toronto: Methuen, 1981, 39. {{ISBN|0-458-93920-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later historians would attribute the perception of England's "appearance of orderliness and love of public order" to the preventive principle entrenched in Peel's police system.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Reith, "Preventive Principle of Police," ''Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology (1931-1951),'' vol. 34, no. 3 (Sept.-Oct. 1943): 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical views==
More recent histories have considered the preventive principle in a more critical light, attempting to reconcile its introduction with the broader social changes that were underway in late eighteenth century [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. An obvious problem with the celebratory tone such as the quote above is that Patrick Colquhoun, although he claimed policing was a "new science" and embraced a utilitarian approach to social problems, was not making an original contribution to English order, as he saw it, based purely on scientific insights and British values of liberty.

Instead, he looked to [[France]], where, in his view, they had achieved "the greatest degree of perfection" with their police.&lt;ref name=critchley&gt;T. A. Critchley, ''A History of Police in England and Wales'', 2nd edition. Montclair, NJ: Patterson Smith, 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have noted that preventive police were sprouting up in [[Glasgow]], where he lived before moving to London, calling into question the significance of his river police as a unique policing innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Alastair Dinsmor, "[http://www.scotia-news.com/issue5/ISSUE05a.htm  Glasgow Police Pioneers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716173010/http://www.scotia-news.com/issue5/ISSUE05a.htm |date=2009-07-16 }}," ''The Scotia News'', vol. 2, no. 1 (Winter 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

The significance of preventive policing in eighteenth century metropolitan London is that Colquhoun and the other utilitarians were looking not just at the problem of crime, but to the larger problem posed by the poverty of the working class and in securing private property. What Colquhoun was looking to prevent was poor workers falling into the criminal sub-class.

His river police were targeting not just the handful of river pirates and "mudlarks", but workers on the docks who treated payment "in kind" as part of their over-all wage that sustained them and their families. Colquhoun estimated that one-third of dock workers were stealing, which is what he sought to prevent.&lt;ref&gt;Dick Paterson, [http://www.thamespolicemuseum.org.uk/h_police_1.html Origins of the Thames Police], ''Thames Police Museum''. Retrieved 4 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

By preventing these workers from stealing, they would become fully dependent on money wages, and be disciplined by the wage system; one of the jobs performed by Colquhoun's police was to set wage-rates of dock workers.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Neocleous, "Social Police and the Mechanisms of Prevention: Patrick Colquhoun and the Condition of Poverty," ''British Journal of Criminology'', 40 (2000):719-720.&lt;/ref&gt; Preventive policing, from this perspective, is therefore significant for its role in developing the class system in industrializing England, as part of the broader movement that included the [[enclosure]]s and [[poor law]] to England.

A '''''pro se'' clerk''' is a [[clerk of the court]], employed by the court and found in the [[courthouse]]. This clerk assists people appearing ''[[pro se]]'' (without [[lawyer]]s) to participate in legal actions by providing forms which need to be filled out and explaining some basic rules. While ''pro se'' clerks may or may not be lawyers themselves, they are prohibited from providing legal or strategic advice since in no case do they represent the ''pro se'' litigant.

[[File:Average county property taxes in the United States.jpg|right|500px|Property taxes in the United States]]
Most local governments in the United States impose a '''property tax''', also known as a '''millage rate''', as a principal source of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Hellerstein, Jerome H., and Hellerstein, Walter, ''State and Local Taxation, Cases and Materials'', Eighth Edition, 2001 (hereafter "Hellerstein"), page 97&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[tax]] may be imposed on [[real estate]] or [[personal property]]. The tax is nearly always computed as the [[fair market value]] of the property times an assessment ratio times a [[tax rate]], and is generally an obligation of the owner of the property. Values are determined by local officials, and may be disputed by property owners. For the taxing authority, one advantage of the property tax over the [[sales tax]] or [[income tax]] is that the revenue always equals the tax levy, unlike the other taxes. The property tax typically produces the required revenue for municipalities' tax levies. A disadvantage to the taxpayer is that the tax liability is fixed, while the taxpayer's income is not.

The tax is administered at the local government level. Many states impose limits on how local jurisdictions may tax property. Because many properties are subject to tax by more than one local jurisdiction, some states provide a method by which values are made uniform among such jurisdictions.

Property tax is rarely self-computed by the owner. The tax becomes a legally enforceable obligation attaching to the property at a specific date. Most states impose taxes resembling property tax on [[vehicle registration|vehicles registered]] in the state, and some states tax some other types of business property.

Most jurisdictions below the state level in the United States impose a tax on interests in real property (land, buildings, and permanent improvements) that are considered under state law to be ownership interests.&lt;ref&gt;Hellerstein, page 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Rules vary widely by jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Compare  [http://www.revenue.state.il.us/publications/localgovernment/ptax1004.pdf The Illinois Property Tax System] (hereafter "IL System"), [http://www.lafayetteassessor.com/TopicsPDFs/Louisiana%20Property%20Tax%20Basics%20booklet%203.pdf Louisiana Property Tax Basics] (hereafter "La. Basics"),New York pamphlet [http://www.orps.state.ny.us/pamphlet/taxworks.htm How Property Tax Works] (hereafter "NY Taxworks"), and Texas [http://www.window.state.tx.us/taxinfo/proptax/basics/ Property Tax Basics] (hereafter "Texas Basics).&lt;/ref&gt; However, certain features are nearly universal. Some jurisdictions also tax some types of business personal property, particularly inventory and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Basics, page __. By contrast, the Illinois Constitution prohibits taxation of personal property; see IL System, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; States generally do not impose property taxes.&lt;ref&gt;IL System, page 5; however, see IL System, page 10, for exceptions.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many overlapping jurisdictions may have authority to tax the same property.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Glen, [http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/fisher.property.tax.history.us History of Property Taxes in the United States], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  These include [[Counties#United States|counties]] or [[parishes]], [[Cities#United States|cities]] and/or [[town]]s, [[School district#United States|school districts]], [[Public utility district|utility districts]], and [[Special-purpose district|special taxing authorities]] which vary by state. Few states impose a tax on the value of property. The tax is based on [[fair market value]] of the subject property, and generally [[Attachment (law)|attaches]] to the property on a specific date. The owner of the property on that date is liable for the tax.&lt;ref&gt;See IL System, page 23; La. Basics, page 16; and Texas Basics, page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of tax is determined annually based on market value of each property on a particular date,&lt;ref&gt;Such date varies by jurisdiction, and may be referred to as the assessment date, valuation date, lien date, or other term.&lt;/ref&gt; and most jurisdictions require redeterminations of value periodically. The tax is computed as the determined market value times an assessment ratio times the tax rate.&lt;ref&gt;See La. Basics, Example 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Assessment ratios and tax rates vary among jurisdictions, and may vary by type of property within a jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., IL System, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most jurisdictions' legislative bodies determine their assessment ratios and tax rates, though some states impose constraints on such determinations.

Tax assessors for taxing jurisdictions determine property values in a variety of ways, but are generally required to base such determinations on fair market value.&lt;ref name="Systempage_b"&gt;IL System, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fair market value is that price for a willing and informed seller would sell the property to a willing and informed buyer, neither being under any compulsion to act. Where a property has recently been sold between unrelated sellers, such sale establishes fair market value.  In other (''i.e.'', most) cases, the value must be estimated. Common estimation techniques include the comparable sales method, the depreciated cost method, and an income method approach. Property owners may also declare a value, which is subject to change by the tax assessor.

Once value is determined, the assessor typically notifies the last known property owner of the value determination. Such notices may include the calculated amount of tax. The property owner may then contest the value.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Basics, pages 13 and 21-27. IL System, pages 14-15; La. Basics, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Property values are generally subject to review by a board of review or similar body, before which a property owner may contest determinations.&lt;ref&gt;IL System, pages 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

After values are settled, property tax bills or notices are sent to property owners.&lt;ref&gt;Generally, tax assessors send the bills. In Louisiana, however, the parish sheriff is responsible for billing and collection of property tax. See La. Basics, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Payment times and terms vary widely. If a property owner fails to pay the tax, the taxing jurisdiction has various remedies for collection, in many cases including seizure and sale of the property.  Property taxes constitute a [[lien]] on the property to which transferees are also subject.

== Property subject to tax ==
Nearly all property tax imposing jurisdictions tax [[real property]].&lt;ref name="Hellersteinpage_a"&gt;Hellerstein, page 90.&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes land, buildings, and all improvements (often called [[Fixture (property law)|fixtures]]) that cannot be removed without damage to the property.&lt;ref&gt;IL System, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Taxed property includes homes, farms, business premises, and most other real property.  Many jurisdictions also tax certain types of other property used in a business.  Property existing and located in the jurisdiction on a particular date is subject to this tax.  This date is often January 1 of each year, but varies among jurisdictions.
Property owned by educational, charitable, and religious organizations is usually exempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/constitution/us/amendment-01/05-tax-exemptions-of-religious-property.html|title=Establishment of Religion|author=|date=|website=justia.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tax rates ==
[[Tax rates]] vary widely among jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;See the Tax Foundation study  [http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/1913.html Property Taxes on Owner-Occupied Housing by State, 2004 – 2009].&lt;/ref&gt;  They are generally set by the taxing jurisdiction's governing body.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Basics, page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  The method of determining the rate varies widely, but may be constrained under laws of particular states. In some jurisdictions, property is taxed based on its classification. Classification is the grouping of properties based on similar use.  Examples of classification are residential, commercial, industrial, vacant, and blighted real property. Property classification are used to tax properties at different rates and for different public policy purposes. In Washington D.C. for instance property occupancy is incentivized by taxing residential property at 0.85 percent of assessed value but vacant residential property at 5 percent of assessed value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://otr.cfo.dc.gov/page/real-property-tax-rates|title=Real Property Tax Rates - otr|author=|date=|website=otr.cfo.dc.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rate or millage ===
The rate of tax is a percentage of the assessed value of the property subject to tax.  This in some cases is expressed as a "millage" or dollars of tax per thousand dollars of assessed value.&lt;ref&gt;See Louisiana Property Tax Basics, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessment ratio ==
Most jurisdictions impose the tax on some stated portion of fair market value, referred to as an assessment ratio.&lt;ref&gt;See La. Basics, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  This ratio may vary depending on the type or use of the property.  The assessment ratio can, in many jurisdictions, be changed from year to year by the taxing jurisdiction's governing body. Changes in tax rate or assessment ratio may have the same practical effect of changing net tax due on a particular property.

== Valuation ==

[[File:19237 TaxFoundation v2.gif|thumb|Composition of state and local tax revenues by [[Sales tax in the United States|sales taxes]] (brown), property taxes (white), licenses and other fees (grey), individual and corporate [[State income taxes|income taxes]] (green) in 2007.|upright]]
Determining the value of property is a critical aspect of property taxation, as such value determines the amount of tax due.  Various techniques may be used to determine value.  Except in the case of property recently sold, valuation has some inherently subjective aspects.  Values may change over time, and many states require taxing jurisdictions to redetermine values every three or four years.  The value of property is often determined based on current use of the property, rather than potential uses.&lt;ref name="TexasBasics"&gt;Texas Basics, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Property values are determined at a particular '''valuation date''' for each jurisdiction, which varies widely.

=== Who determines value ===
Property owners may make a declaration of the value of property they own to a taxing authority.  This is often referred to as rendition.&lt;ref&gt;See Texas Basics, page 11 Some jurisdictions require property owners to file a rendition annually for some types of property; see Texas Basics, page 12, and IL System, pages 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;  The taxing authority may accept this value or make its own determination of value.  The value determinations are generally made by a '''tax assessor''' for the taxing authority.  Some states require uniform values to be determined for each particular property.

=== Market value ===
Property values are generally based on [[fair market value]] of the property on the valuation date.  Fair market value has been defined as that price a willing and informed purchaser would pay to an unrelated willing and informed seller where neither party is under compulsion to act.  Sale of the particular property between unrelated persons generally conclusively establishes fair market value on the date of sale.  Thus, a recent sale of the same property provides good evidence of market value.  Where there has been no recent sale, other techniques must be used to determine market value.

=== Assessed value ===
Many jurisdictions impose tax on a value that is only a portion of market value.  This assessed value is the market value times an assessment ratio.&lt;ref name="Systempage"&gt;IL System, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Assessment ratios are often set by local taxing jurisdictions.  However, some states impose constraints on the assessment ratios used by taxing jurisdictions within the state.&lt;ref name="Systempage" /&gt;  Some such restrictions vary by type or use of property, and may vary by jurisdiction within the state.  Some states impose restrictions on the rate at which assessed value may increase.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', California Constitution Article 13A (adopted in [[Proposition 13]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equalization among jurisdictions ===
Many states require that multiple jurisdictions taxing the same property must use the same market value.&lt;ref&gt;IL System, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, such state provides a '''board of equalization''' or similar body to determine values in cases of disputes between jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', [http://www.boe.ca.gov/ California State Board of Equalization]; IL System, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Valuation techniques ===
Tax assessors may use a variety of techniques for determining the value of property that was not recently sold.&lt;ref name="TexasBasics" /&gt;  Determining which technique to use and how to apply it inherently involves judgment.

==== Comparable sales ====
Values may be determined based on recent sales of comparable property.&lt;ref&gt;Texas basics, page 12.  Note that Texas requires that sales more than 24 months before a valuation date not be considered in determining values.&lt;/ref&gt;  The value of most homes is usually determined based on sales of comparable homes in the immediate area.  Valuation adjustments may be necessary to achieve comparability.  Among the factors considered in determining if a property is comparable are:
* Nature of the property (house, office building, bare land, etc.)
* Location
* Size
* Use of the property (residential, commercial, farm, etc.)
* Nature of improvements
** Types and uses of buildings
** Features of the buildings (number of bedrooms, level of amenities, etc.)
** Age of improvements
* Desirability of the property (view, proximity to schools, type of access, nearby detracting features, etc.)
* Restrictions on the property (easements, building code restrictions, physical restrictions, etc.)
* Utility of the property (fertility of land, drainage or lack thereof, environmental issues, etc.)
* General economic conditions

==== Cost ====
Where recent comparable property sales are not available, a cost based approach may be used.  In this approach, the original or replacement cost of a property is reduced by an allowance for decline in value (depreciation) of improvements.&lt;ref name="Systempage" /&gt;  In some jurisdictions, the amount of depreciation may be limited by statute.  Where original cost is used, it may be adjusted for inflation or increases or decreases in cost of constructing improvements.  Replacement cost may be determined by estimates of construction costs.

==== Income ====
An alternative valuation may be used for income producing property based on economic concepts.  Using the income approach, value is determined based on present values expected income streams from the property.&lt;ref name="Systempage" /&gt;  Selection of an appropriate discount rate in determining present values is a key judgmental factor influencing valuation under this approach.

=== Special use values ===
Most taxing jurisdictions provide that property used in any of several manners is subject to special valuation procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Illinois even has different procedures for assessment of farmland than for other property; IL System, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is commonly applied to property used for farming, forestry, or other uses common in the jurisdiction.  Some jurisdictions value property at its "highest and best use", with some of these providing exceptions for homes or agricultural land.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Basics, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Special valuation issues vary widely among jurisdictions.

=== Revaluation ===
All taxing jurisdictions recognize that values of property may change over time.  Thus, values must be redetermined periodically.  Many states and localities require that the value of property be redetermined at three or four year intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Illinois reassessment requirements vary by county; IL System page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such revaluation may follow valuation principles above, or may use mass valuation techniques.

=== Limits on increases ===
Some jurisdictions have set limits on how much property values may be increased from year to year for property tax purposes.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', California's "Proposition 13"; Texas Basics, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  These limits may be applied yearly or cumulatively, depending on the jurisdiction's rules.

== Assessment process ==
The assessment process varies widely by jurisdiction as to procedure and timing.  In many states, the process of assessment and collection may be viewed as a two-year process, where values are determined in the first year and tax assessed and paid in the second.&lt;ref&gt;IL System, page 6; Texas Basics, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most jurisdictions encourage property owners to declare the value of their property at the start of the assessment process.  Property owners in all jurisdictions are given rights to appeal taxing authority determinations, but such rights vary widely.

=== Valuation by assessor ===
Jurisdictions imposing property tax uniformly charge some official with determining value of property subject to tax by the jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;IL System, page 10; Texas Basics, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  This official may be an employee or contractor to the taxing government, and is generally referred to as the '''tax assessor''' in most jurisdictions.  Some taxing jurisdictions may share a common tax assessor for some or all property within the jurisdictions, especially when the jurisdictions overlap.

Tax assessors must first determine what property is subject to tax, compiling lists or rolls of such property.  In many jurisdictions, the tax assessor notifies the last known owner of each property that the property is subject to tax.  The tax assessor must determine the value of each property subject to tax.  Often, the value used is the value from the previous assessment, possibly increased or decreased by a factor determined by the tax assessor.

=== Notification to owner ===
Following determination of value, tax assessors are generally required to notify the property owner(s) of the value so determined.&lt;ref&gt;See Texas Basics, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Procedures vary by jurisdiction. In Louisiana, no formal notice is required; instead, the assessor "opens" the books to allow property owners to view the valuations.&lt;ref&gt;La. Basics, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Texas and some other jurisdictions also require that the notice include very specific items, and such notice may cover multiple taxing jurisdictions.  Some jurisdictions provide that notification is made by publishing a list of properties and values in a local newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;IL System, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some jurisdictions, such notification is required only if the value increases by more than a certain percentage.  In some jurisdictions, the notification of value may also constitute a tax bill or assessment.  Generally, notification of the owner starts the limited period during which the owner may contest the value.

=== Review ===
Owners of property are nearly always entitled to discuss valuations with the tax assessor, and such discussions may result in changes in the assessor's valuation.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Basics, page 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many jurisdictions provide for a review of value determinations.  Such review is often done by a board of review, often composed of residents of the jurisdiction who are not otherwise associated with the jurisdiction's government.&lt;ref&gt;IL System pages 13-16; Texas Basics, page 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, some jurisdictions and some states provide for additional review bodies.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', California State Board of Equalization; IL System, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protest ===
Nearly all jurisdiction provide for a mechanism for contesting the assessor's determination of value.  Such mechanisms vary widely.&lt;ref&gt;See Texas Basics for a guide to preparing protests of value, with advice applicable to most jurisdictions.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judicial appeal ===
All jurisdictions levying property tax must allow property owners to go to court to contest valuation and taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Failure to allow appeal has been held to violate the due process clause of the U.S. constitution.  See also IL System, page 16; Texas Basics, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Procedures for such judicial appeal vary widely.  Some jurisdictions prohibit judicial appeal until administrative appeals are exhausted.  Some permit binding arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Basics, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Levy of tax ===
Tax is levied at the tax rate and assessment ratio applicable for the year.&lt;ref&gt;Illinois refers to the process of determining the tax rate and assessment ratio as "levy," to the process of calculating tax amount as "extension," and also refers to the preparation of tax bills.  See IL System, various sections.&lt;/ref&gt;  Taxing jurisdictions levy tax on property following a preliminary or final determination of value.  Property taxes in the United States generally are due only if the taxing jurisdiction has levied or billed the tax.  The form of levy or billing varies, but is often accomplished by mailing a tax bill to the property owner or mortgage company.&lt;ref&gt;IL System, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exemptions and incentives ==
Taxing jurisdictions provide a wide variety of methods a property owner may use to reduce tax.  Nearly all jurisdictions provide a [[homestead exemption]] reducing the taxable value, and thus tax, of an individual's home.&lt;ref&gt;La. Basics, page 5; IL System, pages 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Many provide additional exemptions for veterans.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Basics, pages 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Taxing jurisdictions may also offer temporary or permanent full or partial exemptions from property taxes, often as an incentive for a particular business to locate its premises within the jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;IL System, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some jurisdictions provide broad exemptions from property taxes for businesses located within certain areas, such as [[Urban Enterprise Zones|enterprise zones]].&lt;ref&gt;IL System, page 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest property tax exemption is the exemption for registered non-profit organizations; all 50 states fully exempt these organizations from state and local property taxes with a 2009 study estimating the exemption's forgone tax revenues range from $17-$32 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urban.org/uploadedpdf/412460-property-tax-exemption-nonprofits.pdf|title=The Property Tax Exemption for Nonprofits and Revenue Implications for Cities|author=Daphne A. Kenyon|publisher=Urban Institute|date=November 2011|accessdate=2015-02-01|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exemptions can be quite substantial. In New York City alone, an Independent Budget Office study found that religious institutions would have been taxed $627M yearly without such exemptions; all exempt groups avoided paying a combined $13 billion in the fiscal year of 2012 (1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/apple_losing_in_property_tax_breaks_TbEIf72TNrXY5q5OQlfNuO | work=New York Post | title=New York City's losing $13.5B in property-tax breaks | date=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Payment ==
Time and manner of payment of property taxes varies widely.&lt;ref&gt;Dates may also vary within a state; Texas Basics, page 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  Property taxes in many jurisdictions are due in a single payment by January 1.  Many jurisdictions provide for payment in multiple installments.&lt;ref&gt;IL System, page 22; Texas Basics, page 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions, the first installment payment is based on prior year tax.  Payment is generally required by cash or check delivered or mailed to the taxing jurisdiction.

== Liens and seizures ==
Property taxes generally [[Attachment (law)|attach]] to the property; that is, they become an encumbrance on the property which the current and future owners must satisfy.&lt;ref name="Systempage_a"&gt;IL System, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  This attachment, or lien, generally happens automatically without further action of the taxing authority.&lt;ref name="Systempage_a" /&gt;  The lien generally is removed automatically upon payment of the tax.

If the tax is not paid within a specified period of time (including additional interest, penalties, and costs), a [[tax sale]] is held, which may result in either 1) the actual sale of a property, or 2) a lien sold to a third party, who (after another specified period of time) may take action to claim the property, or force a later sale to redeem the lien.

== Attachment date ==
The tax lien attaches to the property&lt;ref name="TexasBasics_a"&gt;Texas Basics, page 33.&lt;/ref&gt; at a specific date, generally the date the tax liability becomes enforceable.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Basics, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  This date varies by state, and in some states by local jurisdiction.

=== Delinquency ===
Where the property owner does not pay tax by the due date, the taxing authority may assess penalties and interest.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Basics, page 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  The amount, timing, and procedures vary widely.  Generally, the penalty and interest are enforceable in the same manner as the tax, and attach to the property.

=== Seizure and sale ===
Where the property owner fails to pay tax, the taxing authority may act to enforce its lien. Enforcement procedures vary by state.  In some states, the lien may be sold by the taxing authority to a third party, who can then attempt collection.&lt;ref&gt;IL System, pages 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  In most states, the taxing authority can seize the property and offer it for sale, generally at a public auction.&lt;ref name="TexasBasics_a" /&gt;  In some states, rights acquired in such sale may be limited.

== Tax administrations ==
Property taxes are generally administered separately by each jurisdiction imposing property tax,&lt;ref name="Systempage_b" /&gt; though some jurisdictions may share a common property tax administration.  Often the administration of the taxes is conducted from the taxing jurisdiction's administrative offices (e.g., town hall).  The form and organization varies widely.

=== Assessors ===
Most taxing jurisdictions refer to the official charged with determining property values, assessing, and collecting property taxes as assessors.  Assessors may be elected, appointed, hired, or contracted, depending on rules within the jurisdiction, which may vary within a state.  Assessors may or not be involved in collection of tax.&lt;ref&gt;La. Basics, page 2, indicates the parish sheriff bills and collects property tax.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tax assessors in some states are required to pass certain certification examinations and/or have a certain minimum level of property valuation experience.&lt;ref name="Systempage_b" /&gt;  Larger jurisdictions employ full-time personnel in the tax assessors office, while small jurisdictions may engage only one part-time person for the entire tax assessor function.

== Constitutional limitations ==
Property taxes, like all taxes in the United States, are subject to constraints under the United States and applicable state constitutions.  The [[United States Constitution]] contains three relevant provisions: [[Taxing and Spending Clause|limits on federal direct taxation]], an [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection rule]], and the [[Privileges and Immunities Clause|privileges and immunities provisions]].&lt;ref name="Hellersteinpage"&gt;Hellerstein, page __.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly all state constitutions impose uniformity and equality rules.  Most state constitutions also impose other restrictions, which vary widely.

The federal government is generally prohibited from imposing [[direct taxes]] unless such taxes are then given to the states in proportion to population.  Thus, ''[[Ad valorem tax|ad valorem]]'' property taxes have not been imposed at the federal level.

The states must grant residents of other states equal protections as taxpayers.

=== Uniformity and equality ===
State constitutions constrain taxing authorities within the state, including local governments.  Typically, these constitutions require that property taxes be uniformly or equally assessed.  While many states allow differing rates of taxation among tax jurisdictions, most prohibit the same jurisdiction from applying different rates to different taxpayers. These provisions have generally been interpreted to mean the method of valuation and assessment must be consistent from one local government to another.  Some state courts have held that this uniformity and equality requirement does not prevent granting individualized tax credits (such as exemptions and incentives).  Some states permit different classes of property (as opposed to different classes of taxpayer) to be valued using different assessment ratios.  In many states the uniformity and equality provisions apply only to property taxes, leading to significant classification problems.&lt;ref name="Hellersteinpage" /&gt;

== History ==
Property taxes in the United States originated during colonial times.&lt;ref&gt;See Ely, Richard T., [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=85780469 Taxation in American Cities and Towns], 1888 (hereafter "Ely"), page 110-111, discussing property tax in Springfield, Mass. after 1655.  Also see Hellerstein citing Jens P. Jensen, '''Property Taxation in the United States''', 1931, referring to a 1634 Massachusetts property tax statute; New Jersey League of Municipalities [http://www.njslom.org/property-tax-history/index.html "Short History of the New Jersey property Tax"] (hereafter NJLM); and Fisher, Glen W., [http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/fisher.property.tax.history.us "History of Property Taxes in the United States]," Wichita State University.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1796, state and local governments in fourteen of the fifteen states taxed land, but only four taxed inventory (stock in trade).  Delaware did not tax property, but rather the income from it.  In some states, "all property, with a few exceptions, was taxed; in others, specific objects were named. Land was taxed in one state according to quantity, in another according to quality, and in a third not at all. Responsibility for the assessment and collection of taxes in some cases attached to the state itself; in others, to the counties or townships."  Vermont and North Carolina taxed land based on quantity, while New York and Rhode Island taxed land based on value.  Connecticut taxed land based on type of use.  Procedures varied widely.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Ely, page 116-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period from 1796 until the [[Civil War (United States)|Civil War]], a unifying principle developed: "the taxation of all property, movable and immovable, visible and invisible, or real and personal, as we say in America, at one uniform rate."&lt;ref&gt;Ely, page 131. NJLM indicates that New Jersey adopted uniform assessments based on actual value in 1851, and the concept was added to the New Jersey constitution in 1875.&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period, property taxes came to be assessed based on value.  This was introduced as a requirement in many state constitutions.

After the Civil War, intangible property, including corporate stock, took on far greater importance. Taxing jurisdictions found it difficult to find and tax this sort of property.  This trend led to the introduction of alternatives to the property tax (such as [[Income tax in the United States|income]] and [[Sales taxes in the United States|sales taxes]]) at the state level.&lt;ref name="Hellersteinpage_a" /&gt;  Property taxes remained a major source of government revenue below the state level. Connecticut taxed land based on type of use.  Procedures varied widely.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Hard times during the [[Great Depression]] led to high delinquency rates and reduced property tax revenues.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, ''supra''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also during the 1900s, many jurisdictions began exempting certain property from taxes.  Many jurisdictions exempted homes of war veterans. After [[World War II]], some states replaced exemptions with "circuit breaker" provisions limiting increases in value for residences.

Various economic factors have led to taxpayer initiatives in various states to limit property tax.  [[California Proposition 13 (1978)]] amended the [[California Constitution]] to limit aggregate property taxes to 1% of the "full cash value of such property."  It also limited the increase in assessed value of real property to an inflation factor that was limited to 2% per year.

==Policy issues==
There are numerous policy issues regarding property tax, including:{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}
* Fairness, or lack thereof
* Progressivity, or lack thereof
* Administrability/socialist redistribution of taxpayer funds
* Allodial title vs. true ownership of property
In spite of these issues, many aspects of the property tax, and the reliance of local governments on it as a principal source of revenue, have remained much the same since colonial times.

==Opinions on property tax==

=== Sprawl ===
In the absence of urban planning policies, property tax on real estate changes the incentives for developing land, which in turn affects land use patterns. One of the main concerns is whether or not it encourages [[urban sprawl]].

The [[market value]] of undeveloped real estate reflects a property's current use as well as its development potential. As a city expands, relatively cheap and undeveloped lands (such as farms, ranches, private conservation parks, etc.) increase in value as neighboring areas are developed into retail, industrial, or residential units. This raises the land value, which increases the property tax that must be paid on agricultural land, but does not increase the amount of [[revenue]] per land area available to the owner. This, along with a higher sale price, increases the incentive to rent or sell agricultural land to developers. On the other hand, a property owner who develops a parcel must thereafter pay a higher tax, based on the value of the improvements. This makes the development less attractive than it would otherwise be. Overall, these effects result in lower density development, which tends to increase sprawl.

Attempts to reduce the impact of property taxes on sprawl include:
* '''[[Land value tax]]ation''' - This method separates the value of a given property into its actual components&amp;nbsp;— land value and improvement value. A gradually lower and lower tax is levied on the improvement value and a higher tax is levied on the land value to insure revenue-neutrality. A similar method is known as split-rate taxation.
* '''Current-use valuation''' - This method assesses the value of a given property based only upon its current use. Much like land value taxation, this reduces the effect of city encroachment.
* '''[[Conservation easement]]s''' - The property owner adds a restriction to the property prohibiting future development. This effectively removes the development potential as a factor in the property taxes.
* '''Exemptions''' - Exempting favored classes of real estate (such as farms, ranches, cemeteries or private conservation parks) from the property tax altogether or assessing their value at a minimal amount (for example, $1 per acre).
* '''Forcing higher density housing''' - In the [[Portland, Oregon]] area, for example, local municipalities are often forced to accept higher density housing with small lot sizes. This is governed by a multi-county development control board, in Portland's case [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|Metro]].
* '''[[Urban growth boundary]]''' or '''[[Green belt]]''' - Government declares some land undevelopable until a date in the future. This forces regional development back into the urban core, increasing density but also land and housing prices. It may also cause development to skip over the restricted-use zone, to occur in more distant areas, or to move to other cities.

=== Distributional ===
Property tax has been shown to be [[regressive tax|regressive]] &lt;ref name="whopays" /&gt; (that is, to fall disproportionately on those of lower income) when not correctly implemented because of its impact on particular low-income/high-asset groups such as [[pension]]ers and farmers. Because these persons have high-assets accumulated over time, they have a high property tax liability, although their realized income is low. Therefore, a larger proportion of their income goes to paying the tax. In areas with speculative land appreciation (such as California in the 1970s and 2000s), there may be little or no relationship between property taxes and a homeowner's ability to pay them short of selling the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

This issue was a common argument used by supporters of such measures as [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|California Proposition 13]] or [[Oregon Ballot Measure 5 (1990)|Oregon Ballot Measure 5]]; some economists have even called for the abolition of property taxes altogether, to be replaced by [[income tax]]es, [[consumption tax]]es such as Europe's [[value added tax|VAT]], or a combination of both. &lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:WhoOwnsTaxableBaltimoreLandValue.png|thumbnail|right|Who Owns Baltimore]] --&gt;Others, however, have argued that property taxes are broadly [[progressive tax|progressive]], since people of higher incomes are disproportionately likely to own more valuable property. In addition, while nearly all households have some income, nearly a third of households own no real estate. Moreover, the most valuable properties are owned by corporations not individuals. Hence, property is more unevenly distributed than income.

It has been suggested that these two beliefs are not incompatible&amp;nbsp;— it is possible for a tax to be progressive in general but to be regressive in relation to minority groups. However, although not direct, and not likely one-to-one, property renters can be subject to property taxes as well. If the tax reduces the supply of housing units, then it will increase the rental price. In this way, the owner's cost of taxation is passed on to the renter (occupant).

==== Progressive policies ====
As property increases in value the possibility exists that new buyers might pay taxes on outdated values thus placing an unfair burden on the rest of the property owners. To correct this imbalance municipalities periodically revalue property. Revaluation produces an up-to-date value to be used in determination of the tax rate necessary to produce the required tax levy.

A consequence of this is that existing owners are reassessed as well as new owners and thus are required to pay taxes on property the value of which is determined by market forces, such as [[gentrification]] in low income areas of a city. In an effort to relieve the frequently large tax burdens on existing owners, particularly those with fixed incomes such as the elderly and those who have lost their jobs, communities have introduced exemptions.

In some states, laws provide for exemptions (typically called [[homestead exemption]]s) and/or limits on the percentage increase in tax, which limit the yearly increase in property tax so that owner-occupants are not "taxed out of their homes". Generally, these exemptions and ceilings are available only to property owners who use their property as their principal residence. Homestead exemptions generally cannot be claimed on [[Real estate investing|investment properties]] and [[Vacation property|second homes]]. When a homesteaded property changes ownership, the property tax often rises sharply and the property's sale price may become the basis for new exemptions and limits available to the new owner-occupant.

Homestead exemptions increase the complexity of property tax collection and sometimes provide an easy opportunity for people who own several properties to benefit from tax credits to which they are not entitled. Since there is no national database that links home ownership with [[Social Security number]]s, landlords sometimes gain homestead tax credits by claiming multiple properties in different states, and even their own state, as their "principal residence", while only one property is truly their residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, several US Senators and Congressmen were found to have erroneously claimed "second homes" in the greater Washington, D.C. area as their "principal residences", giving them property tax credits to which they were not entitled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Undeserved homestead exemption credits became so ubiquitous in the state of Maryland that a law was passed in the 2007 legislative session to require validation of principal residence status through the use of a social security number matching system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Some people feel school systems would be more uniform if the taxes were collected and distributed at a state level, thereby equalizing the funding of school districts. Others are reluctant to have a higher level of government determine the rates and allocations, preferring to leave the decisions to government levels closer to the people.

In Rhode Island efforts are being made to modify revaluation practices to preserve the major benefit of property taxation, the reliability of tax revenue, while providing for what some view as a correction of the unfair distribution of tax burdens on existing owners of property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has held{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} that Congress can directly tax land ownership so long as the tax is apportioned among the states based upon representation/population. In an apportioned land tax, each state would have its own rate of taxation sufficient to raise its pro-rata share of the total revenue to be financed by a land tax. So, for example, if State A has 5% of the population, the State A would collect and remit to the federal government such tax revenue that equals 5% of the revenue sought. Such an apportioned tax on land had been used on many occasions up through the Civil War.

[[Indirect taxes]] on the [[Transfer tax|transfer of land]] are permitted without apportionment: in the past, this has taken the form of requiring [[revenue stamp]]s to be affixed to deeds and mortgages, but these are no longer required by federal law. Under the Internal Revenue Code, the government realizes a substantial amount of revenue from income taxes on [[capital gain]]s from the sale of land and in [[Estate tax (United States)|estate taxes]] from the passage of property (including land) upon the death of its owner.

[[Milton Friedman]] noted that "[T]he property tax is one of the least bad taxes, because it's levied on something that cannot be produced&amp;nbsp;— that part that is levied on the land".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.adamnash.com/2006/11/05/qa-with-milton-friedman-education-health-care-iraq/|title=Q&amp;A with Milton Friedman: Education, Health Care &amp; Iraq|author=|date=5 November 2006|website=adamnash.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 analysis from the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] was consistent with Friedman's opinion; examining the effect of various types of taxes on economic growth, it found that property taxes "seem[ed] to be the most growth-friendly, followed by consumption taxes and then by personal income taxes."&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Jens.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3332">In law, a {{Lang|la|'''reformatio in peius'''}} ([[Latin language|Latin]]: "change for the worse") occurs when, as the result of an [[appeal]], the [[appellant]] is put in a worse position than if they had not appealed. For example, an appellant in a [[criminal case]] might receive a more severe sentence on appeal than in their original trial. 

Whether or not ''reformationes in peius'' are allowed depends on the jurisdiction and the applicable [[procedural law]]. In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, ''reformationes in peius'' are generally not allowed in appeals in [[administrative law]] cases, as well as in [[criminal law|criminal]] and [[private law|civil]] appeals as long as only one party appeals the decision. However, exceptions exist.

== Prohibition of ''reformatio in peius'' at the European Patent Office ==
Under the [[case law]] of the [[Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office]] (EPO), a Board cannot put a sole appellant in a worse position than if he had not appealed the first instance decision.  Hence in relation to appeals, the term "prohibition of ''reformatio in peius''" essentially means that a person should not be placed in a worse position as a result of filing an appeal.  Thus, in general, EPO Boards of Appeal are prevented in opposition appeal proceedings from going beyond the request of a sole appellant to put it in a worse position than it was before it appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Case law book|iv|e|3|1}} "Binding effect of requests - no reformatio in peius".&lt;/ref&gt; The central case detailing this principle is [[G 4/93]] consolidated with [[G 9/92]]. 

This principle however does not hold without exceptions, as laid out for example in decision [[G 1/99]]. In this case, an error of judgement had been made by an [[Opposition procedure before the European Patent Office|Opposition Division]] in allowing the addition of a limiting feature going beyond the content of the application as filed (contrary to {{EPC Article|123|2}}). The Board allowed the patent proprietor to file requests in order to overcome this deficiency, since
{{quotation|(...) it would be inequitable for the patent proprietor not to be given a fair opportunity to mitigate the consequences of errors of judgement made by the Opposition Division.&lt;ref&gt; [http://documents.epo.org/projects/babylon/eponet.nsf/0/D64B45711A089869C12572C80062D998/$File/09_3811.pdf Decision of the Enlarged Board of Appeal dated 2 April 2001, G 1/99], reasons 14.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Still under the case law of the boards of appeal of the EPO, the doctrine of ''reformatio in peius'' does not however apply separately to each point or issue decided, or to the reasoning leading to the impugned decision.&lt;ref&gt; "According to the established case law of the boards of appeal, the doctrine of reformatio in peius does not apply separately to each point or issue decided, or to the reasoning leading to the impugned decision (see T 149/02 of 25 July 2003, point 3.2.1)." in [http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/biblio/t080384eu1.htm EPO Board of Appeal decision T 0384/08 of 26 June 2009], Reasons 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of Scientology]] has been involved in court disputes in several countries. In some cases, when the Church has initiated the dispute, questions have been raised as to its motives.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news | first = Douglas | last = Frantz | title = An Ultra-Aggressive Use of Investigators and the Courts | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E3D71639F93AA35750C0A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work =  | publisher = The New York Times | date = March 9, 1997 | accessdate = 2007-12-27 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Church says that its use of the legal system is necessary to protect its intellectual property and its right to [[freedom of religion]]. Critics say that most of the Church's claims are designed to harass [[Suppressive Person]]s, people who impede the progress of the Scientology movement.&lt;ref name="Offensive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sppulitzer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

In the years since its inception, the Church of Scientology's lawsuits filed against newspapers, magazines, government agencies (including the United States tax collecting unit, [[Internal Revenue Service|the IRS]]), and individuals have numbered in the thousands. In 1991, ''Time'' magazine estimated that the Church spends an average of about $20&amp;nbsp;million per year on various legal actions,&lt;ref name="Time-Behar"&gt;
{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Behar|title=The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power|page=50|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]|date=May 6, 1991|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Fishman/time-behar.html|accessdate=2006-08-09}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and it is the exclusive client of several law firms.  According to a U.S. District Court Memorandum of Decision in 1993, Scientologists "have abused the federal court system by using it, inter alia, to destroy their opponents, rather than to resolve an actual dispute over trademark law or any other legal matter. This constitutes 'extraordinary, malicious, wanton, and oppressive conduct.' ... It is abundantly clear that plaintiffs sought to harass the individual defendants and destroy the church defendants through massive over-litigation and other highly questionable litigation tactics. The Special Master has never seen a more glaring example of bad faith litigation than this."&lt;ref&gt;
''RTC v. Robin Scott'', U. S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 85-711-JMI (Bx) 85-7197-JMI (Bx), January 20, 1993, Memorandum of Decision [http://www.lermanet.com/cos/morejud.html]
&lt;/ref&gt; Rulings such as this have classified the Church of Scientology as a chronically [[vexatious litigant]].  Legal disputes initiated by Scientology against its former members, the media or others include the following:
* Religious discrimination cases, including recognition as a religious organization. &lt;!--general text needed--&gt;
* [[Copyright]] infringement cases. Scientology's religious documents are copyrighted, and many are available only to members who pay for higher levels of courses and [[auditing (Scientology)|auditing]].
* [[Defamation|Libel and slander]] cases.

In the past, the Church has been involved in criminal court cases (e.g. ''[[United States v. Hubbard]]''), but increasingly, lawsuits are being brought by former Church members against the Church, such as:
*  Human Trafficking and Forced Labor (''[[The Hole (Scientology)#Headley et al. v. Church of Scientology International et al.|Claire and Mark Headley v. Church of Scientology, Int'l]]'')
*  Fraud and Misrepresentation&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10626116 California couple sues over donations to Scientology, The Guardian,  January 23, 2013 (accessed on February 22, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Libel (e.g. ''[[Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto]]'').

==The Church's view==
Scientologists say that the church's main goal is to be recognized as a religion, which on occasion has met resistance from opponents (including national governments), and this has forced it to have recourse to the courts.

One such area is recognition as an official religion in various governments around the world.  Scientology's path to legal recognition as a religion in [[New Zealand]] took 48 years and several lawsuits.&lt;ref name="hrwf"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The activities of the Church of Scientology are not prohibited or limited in any way in the [[European Union]] and Scientology enjoys the full freedom of any church in these countries.

Some governments, however, have labeled the church as a [[cult]]. Although the status is not changed or the freedom is not limited, German&lt;ref name="germany-embassy-US"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and Belgian government entities have accused Scientology of violating the human rights of its members and therefore called it a "[[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] cult" and a "commercial enterprise".  In 1995, a parliamentary report in France classified it, along with 172 other religious groups, as a "dangerous cult."&lt;ref name="france-assembly-report"&gt;
[[French National Assembly]] [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp Report of the Board of Inquiry into Cults] (1995-12-22, in French, [http://www.cftf.com/french/Les_Sectes_en_France/cults.html English translation] available)
&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, the government had refused to consider the church for registration as a religious organization, which became the subject of proceedings before the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in the case of ''[[Church of Scientology Moscow v. Russia]]''. The court decided that Russia's refusal to consider the Church of Scientology's application for registration as a religious community "had been a violation of Article 11 (freedom of assembly and association) of the European Convention on Human Rights read in the light of Article 9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion)."

==L. Ron Hubbard and lawsuits==
Critics state that the ultimate aim of Scientology lawsuits is to destroy church opponents by [[Strategic lawsuit against public participation|forcing them into bankruptcy or submission]], using its resources to pursue [[frivolous litigation|frivolous lawsuits]] at considerable cost to defendants. In doing so, they draw particular attention to certain controversial statements made by the church's founder, [[L. Ron Hubbard]], in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="Offensive"&gt;

In 1994, Scientology attorney [[Moxon &amp; Kobrin|Helena Kobrin]] was fined $17,775 for filing a frivolous lawsuit.&lt;ref name="kobrin-fine"&gt;

{{quote|The purpose of the suit is to harass and discourage rather than win. The law can be used very easily to harass, and enough harassment on somebody who is simply on the thin edge anyway, well knowing that he is not authorized, will generally be sufficient to cause professional decease. If possible, of course, ruin him utterly.|[[L. Ron Hubbard]]|The Scientologist, a Manual on the Dissemination of Material, 1955}}

Critics also allege that the Church uses litigation as a cover for intimidation tactics, such as investigating the [[criminal record]]s (or lack thereof) of opponents and subjecting them to [[surveillance]] and invasive inquiries, both to discourage further criticism and to ensure the opponent's unwillingness to fight the lawsuit. A policy letter by L. Ron Hubbard, distributed in early 1966, says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is correct procedure:
# Spot who is attacking us.''
# Start investigating them promptly for FELONIES or worse using own professionals, not outside agencies.
# Double curve our reply by saying we welcome an investigation of them.
# Start feeding lurid, blood sex crime actual evidence on the attackers to the press.
Don't ever tamely submit to an investigation of us. Make it rough, rough on attackers all the way.&lt;ref name="attacks-lrh"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics of Scientology cite this passage, among others (such as the widely documented [[Fair Game (Scientology)|Fair Game doctrine]]), to support their contentions that the church uses smear tactics to augment the effectiveness of legal threats.&lt;ref name="Offensive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sppulitzer"/&gt;

Notable Scientology court cases include the following:

===Cases before the European Court of Human Rights===
{{Main|Church of Scientology Moscow v. Russia}}
* On April 5, 2007, the Church of Scientology of Moscow won a [[Church of Scientology Moscow v. Russia|judgment]] against the Russian government establishing its right to recognition as a religious organization. The [[European Court of Human Rights|European Court]] held that the government's refusal of registration "...&amp;nbsp;had no lawful basis... the Moscow authorities did not act in good faith and neglected their duty of neutrality and impartiality vis-à-vis the applicant's religious community.".&lt;ref name="ECHR-Russia"&gt;

===Cases in the United States===
* Court case in 1976 concerning [[Operation Freakout]], a church campaign targeting the author [[Paulette Cooper]].
* Court case in 1979 and criminal convictions of 11 high-ranking officials regarding [[Operation Snow White]], the largest then-known program of domestic espionage in U.S. history.
* In 1984, the church began a legal battle with [[Gerry Armstrong (activist)|Gerry Armstrong]] that spanned two decades. The church sued Armstrong for providing confidential documents about [[L. Ron Hubbard]] to Armstrong's attorney. The court found that Armstrong's actions were justifiable and affirmed this conclusion in ''[[Church of Scientology v. Gerald Armstrong]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Church of Scientology v. Armstrong]]&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong settled his counter-claims with the church in December 1986 for $800,000 in exchange for his agreement to keep confidential his experience with the church. The church sued Armstrong for $10.5&amp;nbsp;million in 1995 and 2002 for allegedly violating the confidentiality agreement in 131 instances. A California appellate court awarded the church $321,923 in damages and $334,671.75 in attorneys fees in 1995, and $500,000 in damages in 2004. The court noted that "Armstrong makes no claim that he has complied, or will ever comply, with the injunction" and that Armstrong claims to now reside in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; As the TV news program ''[[60 Minutes]]'' reported in 1997, Scientologists filed over fifty lawsuits against the non-profit organization, which spent over $2&amp;nbsp;million on its legal defense. After one court handed down a judgment of $1&amp;nbsp;million against CAN, the organization filed for bankruptcy and auctioned off its assets, which were purchased for $20,000 by a lawyer affiliated with Scientology.
* In May 1991, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine published a cover story on Scientology entitled "[[The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power]]".&lt;ref name="Time-Behar" /&gt; The Church responded by suing ''Time'' for $400&amp;nbsp;million; a five-year legal battle ensued in which ''Time'' spent approximately $7&amp;nbsp;million defending itself in court.

This legal case included claims by Scientology that [[hyperlink]]s to alleged copyright infringements were also illegal. Spaink's case was taken all the way to the Supreme Court of the Netherlands; however, the Court rejected Scientology's claims in their entirety, including the claims regarding hyperlinks.&lt;ref name="edri"&gt;

* When the Church was charged with a felony count of practicing medicine without a license in the 1996 case involving the death of Scientologist [[Lisa McPherson]], Florida asked for damages of approximately $15,000 to be awarded against the organization. The Church hired law firms and medical specialists at an estimated cost of over $1&amp;nbsp;million, waging a defense that eventually resulted in the case being dismissed due to lack of credible evidence. On May 29, 2004, the Church paid an undisclosed amount to settle a wrongful death suit brought on behalf of McPherson's estate.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; An article on the suit describes legal attacks made by Scientology's attorneys:
&lt;blockquote&gt;{{interp|McPherson family attorney Ken}} Dandar has persevered through a seemingly endless barrage of legal attacks. There have been nine attempts to disqualify him, and four attempts to remove Lisa's aunt, Dell Liebreich, as executor of Lisa's estate. Scientology attorneys have filed bar complaints against both him and Lirot, lawsuits against Lisa's family, and motions to remove judges and move the case to other venues. When asked how going up against Scientology compares to normal litigation, {{interp|First Amendment attorney Luke}} Lirot replied, "It's like comparing LSD to orange juice." ... The wrongful death case went through four judges in seven years.&lt;ref name="razor-touretzky"&gt;

* In the case of ''Wollersheim vs. Church of Scientology'' (1980), former member [[Lawrence Wollersheim|Larry Wollersheim]] sued the organization for mental distress, and was awarded $30&amp;nbsp;million in damages. On appeal, the award was reduced to $2.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=wollersheim&gt;[[Wikisource:Wollersheim v.

* [[Bonnie Woods]], a former member who began counseling people involved with Scientology and their families, became a target along with her husband Richard in 1993 when the Church of Scientology started a leaflet operation denouncing her as a "hate campaigner" with demonstrators outside their home and around [[East Grinstead]]. She and her family were followed by a private investigator, and a creditor of theirs was located and provided free legal assistance to sue them into bankruptcy. After a long battle of libel suits, in 1999 the church agreed in a settlement to issue an apology&lt;ref&gt;

===Cases in Canada===
* In ''[[R. v. Church of Scientology of Toronto]], et al.'' (1992), the Church of Scientology was convicted on two charges of breaching the public trust, and seven members were convicted on various charges.
* In ''[[Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto]]'', Justice Casey Hill, at that time a [[Crown attorney]] involved in the ''R. v. Church of Scientology of Toronto'' case, sued and won CAD$1,600,000 for libel, the largest libel damage award in Canadian history. During the case, it was shown that a file had been kept on him as an "Enemy Canada." In their decision (1995), the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] found:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In this case, there was ample evidence upon which the jury could properly base their finding of aggravated damages. The existence of the file on Casey Hill under the designation "Enemy Canada" was evidence of the malicious intention of Scientology to "neutralize" him. The press conference was organized in such a manner as to ensure the widest possible dissemination of the libel. Scientology continued with the contempt proceedings although it knew its allegations were false. In its motion to remove Hill from the search warrant proceedings, it implied that he was not trustworthy and might act in those proceedings in a manner that would benefit him in his libel action. It pleaded justification or truth of its statement when it knew it to be false. It subjected Hill to a demeaning cross-examination and, in its address to the jury, depicted Hill as a manipulative actor.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Seven Circles Act''', 1874, was an [[Act of Parliament|act]] of the [[Cape Parliament]] that divided the [[Cape Colony]] into seven provinces (or "circles") for the Legislative Council elections.

Previously, the country had been divided into two large provinces, the Western and the Eastern Provinces, which had led to decades of polarisation and competition. The act was important in that it ended the bitter political schism that had divided the Cape for much of the 19th century. It formed part of the 1874 Constitutional Amendment Bill.&lt;ref name=madden&gt;{{cite book|last1=Madden|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nZHdAZDr-kYC&amp;pg=PA536&amp;lpg=PA536&amp;dq=%22seven+circles%22+cape#v=onepage&amp;q=%22seven%20circles%22%20cape&amp;f=false |title=Settler Self-government, 1840–1900: The Development of Representative and Responsible Government|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |date=1990 |accessdate=2013-10-08|display-authors=etal|isbn=9780313273261 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:1854 opening of the 1st Cape Parliament - Cape Archives.jpg|thumb|right|The Cape Parliament, 1854.]]
The [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope]] was [[bicameral]], with a lower house (Legislative Assembly) and an upper house (Legislative Council). The latter had considerable power and influence on the lower house, and was elected according to two large provinces:
* The Western Province,  centred on [[Cape Town]] 
* The Eastern Province,  centred on [[Port Elizabeth]]

===The Western Province===

The Western Province was larger, and was the seat of the country's capital city, [[Cape Town]], however the electoral system gave the two entities near equal political power. (The Western province had only two more seats than the Eastern, though its voting population was very much larger.) The result was political competition, which gradually evolved into growing regional political parties, and then into severe polarisation between the two provinces. The instability of the system often paralyzed government.

===The Eastern Province===

In fear of dominance by Cape Town, the Eastern Province leaders came to demand greater [[British Empire|British Imperial control]], and a long-running [[Separatism|separatist movement]] arose. Persistent disputes included frontier issues, with the Eastern Province leaders favouring a far harsher and more expansionist policy towards the neighbouring [[Xhosa people]]. The Western Province was dominated by liberals who were less expansionist and were accused by Eastern leaders of favouring the Xhosa in their frontier policy. The deadlock and regional polarisation was complicated by the division between the Eastern towns of [[Port Elizabeth]] and [[Grahamstown]], which began competing for political dominance within the Eastern Province.

==Earlier political developments==
===Representative government (1854–1872)===

The Cape at the time ran a system of representative government, whereby the legislature was elected, but executive power remained firmly in the hands of an unelected British Governor, who was appointed by the British Colonial Office. A resulting lack of accountability led to budget mismanagement and economic stagnation. Distrust of the Governor also led to a deadlock between the elected parliament and the unelected executive. Popular distrust also scuppered Governor Wodehouse's prior attempt (1869) to redraw the electoral districts (this was to be done by abolishing the lower house and establishing a system of alternating councils with 6 electoral districts and greater British control of nominations).

===Responsible government (1872)===

A movement began in the Western Province to make the Executive elected and therefore accountable (or "responsible") to the local electorate. This movement for "[[Responsible Government]]" was opposed by the Eastern leaders who feared Western Province domination (as well as by conservatives in the West). However, the split in the Eastern Province party between Grahamstown and Port Elizabeth, together with the mobilisation of small but growing electoral minorities such as Black African voters (who generally supported the Western Province party), allowed the Western-based leader [[John Molteno]] to institute [[Responsible Government]] in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;R. Kilpin (1901) ''The Old Cape House, being pages from the history of a legislative assembly'' Maskew Miller, Cape Town&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.L. McCracken (1967) ''The Cape Parliament, 1854–1910'', Clarendon Press, Oxford pp. 23 &amp; 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors favouring the change==
From the outset, a serious problem was that the two constituencies were geographically so enormous, that it was practically impossible for any candidate to canvas the electorate across a significant area of their province. Such impracticalities, as well as irregularities that caused just two cities (Cape Town and Grahamstown) to account for over 50% of the electoral strength in their respective provinces, meant that interest in the Council elections was minimal.

Therefore, while the Council wielded significant power in the country, it was correctly perceived to be remote and far-removed from the electorate. It was also widely seen as unaccountable.

In addition, the demographics of the country had substantially changed since the original provinces were constituted, in size, in economic development, and in distribution. The two provinces were therefore even more impractical as electoral districts.

However the primary reason that the change was proposed, was the aforementioned polarisation which resulted from having only two provinces of near equal power.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmot, A. ''The History of our own Times in South Africa, Volume 2''. J.C. Juta &amp; co., 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.A. Le Cordeur: ''The politics of eastern Cape separatism, 1820–1854''. Oxford University Press. 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passing of the bill (1873–74)==
[[File:1 John Molteno - 1st Prime Minister of the Cape - 1860s - Copy2.jpg|thumb|right|The new Prime Minister, [[John Molteno]]]]
In April 1873, Molteno (now the country's first [[Prime Minister]]) put forward the Seven Circles Bill for the first time. His government's declared policy of fighting racial and regional divisions in the country led it to believe that the only way to dilute the two-way regional polarisation was to re-draw the country's electoral divisions. The inadequacy of the current system was widely acknowledged and the act passed in the Legislative Assembly with a large majority. However in the upper house the Council's president used his casting vote to throw the bill out.

In May 1874, the act was reintroduced. The Easterners were led by [[John Paterson (Cape politician)|"Jock" Paterson]] in the Assembly, and by [[Robert Godlonton|"Moral Bob" Godlonton]] in the Council. Both fought the bill unsuccessfully. It was once again carried by a large majority in the Assembly and, on reaching the upper house, was passed with a comfortable majority this time.

The final objection raised by the remaining Eastern Province leaders was that the resulting upper house would in no way resemble the British Westminster [[House of Lords]] model. 
The government's response was that the Cape did not possess, nor should it strive to possess, Lords or any other form of hereditary aristocracy. Molteno himself argued that the Council had a very real authority and power over the country, and that "...it is a serious danger for a body with so much power to be out of touch with the people." 
It was therefore necessary to build a connection with the electorate "…so real as to excite the interest of the masses of the people." For "…the greater the interest of the people in their representatives and the closer they are in touch with them, the more valuable are the results of representative institutions likely to prove."&lt;ref&gt;Molteno, P. A. ''The Life and Times of John Charles Molteno. Comprising a History of Representative Institutions and Responsible Government at the Cape, Volume II''. London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co., Waterloo Place, 1900. p.211.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the act passed into law in 1874, the first election to take place under the new system was only in November 1878. 
&lt;ref name=madden/&gt;

==Provisions==

The act divided the Cape of Good Hope into seven electoral provinces (or "circles"), with each being entitled to elect three representatives to the Legislative Council.

In subdividing the country, Molteno had decided that seven was a sufficiently high number to allow for stable disagreement between the divisions, without causing lasting polarisation. He had insisted on an uneven number so as to avoid political deadlock, and had rejected an earlier suggestion of three, as it would allow for a persistent marginalisation of one of the three. 
A proposal for five was worked out in details but more minor objections were raised, and in the end it was decided that seven was the ideal number so as to ensure stability.

The change, together with the overall rising prosperity of the country, finally ended the regional rivalry between East &amp; West, and put an end to the ongoing Separatist movement of the Eastern Province. 
In effect, it also ended the Western Province's political hegemony over the country, by dispersing the electoral entities.

The effects were also to eliminate the previous disproportionate advantage which the towns of Cape Town and Grahamstown had wielded under the previous system, whereby they had secured an unfairly large proportion of the votes, relative to their population.

In electing members, the voter was given three votes, which could be all given to one candidate, or distributed to three candidates. This was intended to secure the representation of minorities.

Representatives were elected for seven years (as opposed to the ten years under the previous system) and were to be voted in simultaneously at one time. The Presidency of the Legislative Council was still to be taken by the country's Chief Justice.&lt;ref&gt;G.M. Theal (1919) ''History of South Africa, from 1873 to 1884, twelve eventful years'', Allen, London&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandals and negative headlines ==

===Scandal about the merger with Landis and Gyr===
In 2002 the Siemens Group sold seven subsidiary companies to the US financial investor [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]]. Most affected by this sale was the Swiss company Siemens Metering, located in Zug. 160 out of 360 employees lost their jobs. Siemens Metering was the result of the merger between Siemens and Landis &amp; Gyr in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.videoportal.sf.tv http://www.srf.ch/player/tv/schweiz-aktuell/video/stellenabbau-bei-siemens-zug?id=53d63653-5e21-4cc0-b980-25566e636dd0] [[Schweiz aktuell]] (July 26, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
The documentary “Verlorene Welt – Aus dem Innenleben des einstigen Konzerns Landis &amp; Gyr” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.swissfilms.ch [http://www.swissfilms.ch/de/information_publications/festival_search/festivaldetails/-/id_film/2146532720] Swissfilms Database&lt;/ref&gt; by Claudia Schmid and Michael van Orsouw involves the subject and had its first performance at the [[Solothurn Film Festival]] 2006.

===Pension funds scandal===
Siemens sharpened 2006 the rules of conduct for its employees as a reaction of the [[Corporate scandal|financial scandal]] about [[disloyalty]] and assumed [[corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.faz.net [http://www.faz.net/artikel/C30125/korruption-siemens-verschaerft-die-verhaltensregeln-30100557.html] Frankfurter Allgemeine (November 24, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Rüegg and Siemens Manager Roland Rümmeli found themselves in the sight of the investigations. Rümmeli was accused to have redirected [[kickbacks]] to his private accounts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3657">'''Supplementary Homicide Reports''' (abbreviated '''SHR''') is a database of [[homicide]]s in the [[United States]] maintained by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) as part of its [[Uniform Crime Reports]] program. The database consists of detailed reports of homicides reported to the FBI by local law enforcement agencies in 49 states and the [[District of Columbia]]. The only state that does not participate is [[Florida]], which records homicides in a separate tally that is included in a separate spreadsheet online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://data.ap.org/projects/2016/domestic-gun-homicides/ |title=Domestic shooting homicides |website=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Reports==
Each SHR is more detailed than other UCR system reports, because, as Fox &amp; Pierce noted, SHRs include "information about the date, location, circumstances, and method of the offenses and the demographic characteristics of victims and perpetrators."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/107057NCJRS.pdf |title=Uniform Crime Reports: Supplementary Homicide Reports, 1976-1983  |last=Fox |first=James Alan |date=May 1987 |website=NCJRS.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Limitations==
The primary limitation of SHR data is that arising from missing or incomplete reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=James Alan|last2=Swatt|first2=Marc L.|title=Multiple Imputation of the Supplementary Homicide Reports, 1976–2005|journal=Journal of Quantitative Criminology|date=13 September 2008|volume=25|issue=1|pages=51–77|doi=10.1007/s10940-008-9058-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation in the SHR is voluntary; as a result, many American law enforcement agencies either only intermittently submit SHR forms to the FBI, or do not submit any. In addition to missing homicides, some SHR reports that are filed can be missing information, such as that regarding the victim's age, gender, or race, or regarding the identity of the offender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ntmh.pdf |title=The Nation’s Two Measures of Homicide |website=Bureau of Justice Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; This missing information can also include the offender's age, gender, or race, which was omitted from 31% of SHR reports filed in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/21/police-killings-us-government-statistics |title=The counted: inside the search for the real number of police killings in the US |last=McCarthy |first=Tom |date=2015-03-21 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2017-12-28 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from the National Vital Statistics System==
In 2000, the [[National Vital Statistics System]]'s homicide estimates exactly matched those of the SHR in 22% of U.S. counties. The National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) generally produced higher estimates than the SHR does, but in 28% of U.S. counties, the opposite was true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1088767900004004002 |title=A Comparison of Supplementary Homicide Reports and National Vital Statistics System Homicide Estimates for U.S. Counties |last=WIERSEMA |first=BRIAN |last2=LOFTIN |first2=COLIN |date=2000-11-01 |website=Homicide Studies |pages=317–340 |language=en |doi=10.1177/1088767900004004002 |access-date=2017-07-14 |last3=McDOWALL |first3=DAVID}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss '''[[federal popular initiative]] "against mass immigration"'''  ({{lang-de|link=no| Eidgenössische Volksinitiative "Gegen Masseneinwanderung"}}, {{lang-fr|link=no| Initiative populaire « Contre l'immigration de masse »}}, {{lang-it| Iniziativa popolare "Contro l'immigrazione di massa"}}) was a [[referendum]] that aimed to limit immigration through quotas,&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.admin.ch/ch/f/pore/vi/vis413t.html Initiative populaire fédérale « contre l'immigration de masse »], admin.ch (page visited on 9 February 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; as it had been prior to the [[Switzerland–European Union relations|bilateral treaties between Switzerland and the European Union]] (EU) launched 2002.

The proposal was launched by the [[National conservatism|national conservative]] [[Swiss People's Party]] and was accepted by a majority of the electorate (50.3%, a difference of 19,526 votes) and a majority of the [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] (14.5 out of 23; 12 of 20 full cantons plus five of six [[half canton]]s) on 9 February 2014. This initiative was mostly backed by rural (57.6% approvals), suburban (51.2% approvals), and isolated cities (51.3% approvals) of Switzerland as well as by a strong majority (69.2% approvals) in the Italian-speaking canton of [[Ticino]], while metropolitan centers (58.5% rejection) and the French-speaking part (58.5% rejection) of Switzerland rejected it.&lt;ref name="MEIStat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/17/03/blank/key/2014/013.html |title=Abstimmungen – Indikatoren, Abstimmung vom 9.

Swiss-EU bilateral treaties on single market participation are all co-dependent; if one is terminated, then all are terminated. Consequently, should Switzerland choose unilaterally to cancel the free movement agreement, then all its single market agreements with the EU will lapse unless a compromise is found.&lt;ref name=Guardian030716&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/03/eu-swiss-single-market-access-no-free-movement-citizens EU tells Swiss no single market access if no free movement of citizens] [[The Guardian]], 3 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December 2016, Switzerland and the EU concluded an agreement that a new Swiss law (in response to the referendum) may require Swiss employers to give priority to Swiss-based job seekers (Swiss nationals and foreigners registered in Swiss job agencies) but does not limit the free movement of EU workers to Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://euobserver.com/justice/136398 EU and Switzerland agree on free movement]{{snd}}[[euobserver]],  22 Dec 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, 23.4% of Switzerland's population are foreigners (9% in Germany). The net immigration is 80,000 people per year, 1% of the total population (three times more than e.g. in [[Germany]], four times more than in the [[Immigration to the United States|United States]]). Every year 30,000 to 40,000 receive Swiss nationality (this represents a ''per capita'' rate of about three times that of both [[Germany]] and the [[United States]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/07/blank/key/03.html Acquisition of Swiss citizenship], last 5 years, Swiss Federal Statistics Office.

Immigrant workers make up a large part of the Swiss workforce in several industries. [[Scienceindustries]], the Swiss association of chemical, pharma, and biotech businesses, emphasized that they rely on highly qualified workers from outside Switzerland to keep an edge over their competitors, and that 45% out of 67,000 people that its member companies employ in Switzerland are from abroad.&lt;ref name="AAAS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/europe/2014/02/swiss-vote-curb-immigration-could-hamper-research |title=Swiss Vote to Curb Immigration Could Hamper Research |accessdate=16 February 2014 |publisher=AAAS, Science News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[Swiss People's Party]] launched a [[federal popular initiative]] [[Swiss referendums, 2002|"against asylum abuse"]] that was rejected by 50.1% of voters (with a difference of 4,208 votes).&lt;ref name=LT10.02.14&gt;{{fr}} "Un résultat plus serré qu'en 1992 pour l'EEE", ''[[Le Temps]]'', p. 4, Monday 10 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[Swiss referendums, 2009#Biometric passports|referendum on biometric passports]] required by the [[Schengen Agreement]] was also accepted by 50.1% of voters (with a difference of 5,680 votes).&lt;ref name=LT10.02.14/&gt;

More recently, the Swiss People's Party had successfully launched federal popular initiatives [[Minaret controversy in Switzerland|"against the construction of minarets"]] (2009, 57.5%) and [[Swiss referendums, 2010#November|"for the expulsion of criminal foreigners"]] (2010, 52.3%).

==Reception==

===National reactions===
After the acceptance of the federal popular initiative "against mass immigration", views varied widely as to why the initiative was successful at the polls, and how it might actually be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;“Comments on Feb 9 Immigration Initiative: A sampling of excerpted reactions and analyses,” [http://www.business-of-migration.com/migration-today/swiss-immigration-referendum-of-feb-2014/ ''Migration as a travel business'']&lt;/ref&gt; To some observers, the situation was reminiscent of the [[Swiss referendums, 1992|referendum held on 6 December 1992]], when 50.3% of the Swiss people voted against joining the [[European Economic Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.letemps.ch/Page/Uuid/64fcbaa2-919d-11e3-91de-df0b322bfb46 Un nouveau dimanche noir], [[Le Temps|www.letemps.ch]], 9 February 2014 (page visited on 9 February 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swiss People's Party]], which was the main proponent of the initiative, celebrated the referendum outcome as a major victory. The party's head [[Toni Brunner]] stated: "This is a sea change in Switzerland's migration policy. It is clear that immigration will have to be massively restricted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.de/swiss-voters-narrowly-back-referendum-curbing-immigration/a-17420367 "Swiss voters narrowly back referendum curbing immigration"], ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', 9 February 2014 (page visited on 10 February 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luzi Stamm]], the VP of the SVP, praised the outcome of the referendum, saying that Switzerland should "have the right to control [its own immigration]," and indicated that radical right-wing parties in the rest of Europe would enjoy similar victories because of the mistakes of the "[European] politicians."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/shows/sophieco/switzerland-referendum-curb-immigration-381/ Mistakes of Brussels breed radicals across Europe - Luzi Stamm, Swiss' People's Party VP] ''RT'', 24 February 2014. Retrieved 27 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators fear a slowdown in [[Economy of Switzerland|economic activity]] due to the enforcement of the initiative. Business and industry groups were opposed to the initiative during the campaign and expressed concern about the measure's impact on their ability to attract and retain top talent from abroad.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-09/swiss-voters-support-immigration-limits-with-50-3-srf.html Swiss Vote to Curb Immigration in Referendum], [[Bloomberg L.P.]], 9 February 2014 (page visited on 9 February 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Swiss Bankers Association]] expressed disappointment and concern at the result, saying: "We urgently need to hold constructive talks with the EU to explain our position".&lt;ref name="WPost"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/swiss-divided-in-referendum-on-immigration/2014/02/09/eb598286-918b-11e3-97d3-f7da321f6f33_story.html "Swiss voters back limit on immigration"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 9 February 2014 (page visited on 9 February 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although all governing parties except the Swiss People's Party opposed the initiative, the [[Federal Council (Switzerland)|Federal Council (the Swiss government)]] announced that it would promptly start implementing the new constitutional provisions and will set to work on re-introducing immigration quotas "without delay".&lt;ref name="SW"&gt;[http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss_news/Swiss_agree_to_curb_immigration_and_rethink_EU_deal_.html?cid=37877780 "Swiss agree to curb immigration and rethink EU deal"], [[Swissinfo.ch]], 9 February 2014 (page visited on 9 February 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The acceptance of the initiative binds the Swiss government to renegotiate the entire EU labor market agreements with the EU within three years; the current treaties stay in force in the meantime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/business/world/a/21495508/switzerland-nixes-deal-with-croatia-on-free-labour-access/ |title=Switzerland nixes deal with Croatia on free labour access |accessdate=16 February 2014 |date=16 February 2014 |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union reactions===
The [[European Commission]] issued a statement saying that it was "disappointed" in the Swiss referendum on immigration restriction result but would wait to study how exactly the outcome of the referendum affects the relations between Switzerland and the European Union.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/world/europe/swiss-voters-narrowly-approve-curbs-on-immigration.html?hp Swiss Voters Narrowly Approve Curbs on Immigration], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 February 2014. Retrieved 9 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; European Commission vice-president [[Viviane Reding]] stated that the result of the referendum could jeopardise Switzerland's access to the [[European single market]], saying "The single market is not [[Swiss cheese]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f534a5fe-919c-11e3-8fb3-00144feab7de.html#axzz2t8U5FcOs Swiss access to EU market under threat after immigration vote],  ''[[Financial Times]]'', 9 February 2014 (page visited on 12 February 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|July 2016}}, negotiations had not led to any change in the EU's position that access to the European Single Market is inextricably linked to the principle of free movement of people.&lt;ref name=Guardian030716 /&gt;

==Consequences==
Following protracted discussions between Switzerland and the EU, the Swiss government largely climbed down from the initial referendum proposals, adopting instead a "light national preference" to implement the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.letemps.ch/opinions/2016/09/21/immigration-cacophonie-inachevee Immigration: the unfinished cacophony], Le Temps, September 21, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  This outcome was decried as a failure to properly implement the referendum by the Swiss SVP party (which had promoted the referendum) as it fails to put any curbs on immigration.  Its leaders are considering a new referendum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/schweiz/standard/martulloblocher-droht-mit-referendum-gegen-meiumsetzung/story/25528180  Martullo-Blocher threatens with referendum against MEI implementation], Tages Anzeiger, 27 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Their climbdown was largely due to the EU's unwavering negotiating tactic, as it was prepared to put at stake all existing collaborations between Switzerland and the European Union, such as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/schweiz/standard/Ich-sehe-ein-weiteres-Abkommen-gefaehrdet/story/13563492 «Ich sehe ein weiteres Abkommen gefährdet»], ''Tages Anzeiger'', 11 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

* participation in education programs (e.g. [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]])
* participation in research programs (e.g. [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development]])

===Education and research===
In a statement to [[HINA]], EU Commission spokesperson Joe Hennon said that the vote would influence the next round of talks for Swiss inclusion in [[Horizon 2020]] and [[Erasmus+]]. The talks were about programmes which could be applied for in 2014. For the academic year 2011/2012, 2,612 Swiss students went abroad, at the same time 2,673 foreign students came to Switzerland with the Erasmus program.&lt;ref name="AAAS"/&gt;&lt;ref name=tagi-era-ade&gt;[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/schweiz/Erasmus-ade/story/22080854  Erasmus ade?], 2014-02-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Seventh Framework Programme]], the predecessor to Horizon 2020, more than one in four Swiss research proposals were funded in a total of 3,000 projects, which was the fourth highest success rate on average. Swiss researchers secured €1.27 billion in EU funding between 2007-2012, including about €356 million in coveted basic research grants from the [[European Research Council]].&lt;ref name="AAAS"/&gt; According to the "Innovation Union Scoreboard 2013" Switzerland was the overall innovation leader before Sweden, Germany, Denmark and Finland. It continuously outperformed the EU27 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://euobserver.com/news/123077 |title=Swiss vote jeopardises involvement in multi-billion EU programmes |accessdate=16 February 2014 |publisher=EUobserver}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/files/ius-2013_en.pdf Innovation Union Scoreboard 2013], European Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; By 26 February 2014, the EU announced that, at least for 2014, Switzerland's status in Horizon2020 would be downgraded from an associated to third-country and that Swiss-based scientists could not apply for ERC grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/switzerland-downgraded-by-eu-on-research-involvement/2011691.article |title=Switzerland downgraded by EU on research involvement |publisher=Timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=2014-02-26 |accessdate=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum did not impact [[CERN]]'s recruitment as it is an international organisation and does not need Swiss work permits.&lt;ref name="AAAS"/&gt;

===Croatia===
Following the referendum the Federal Council was no longer allowed to sign the already negotiated free movement accord with [[Croatia]], which joined the EU in July 2013. The new Swiss constitution article was immediately binding for the Federal Council, which then looked for a way to not discriminate against Croatia. The European Commission connected the negotiations for the 2014 Erasmus program with the signing of the free movement accord for Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/vorerst-kein-freier-personenverkehr-mit-kroatien Vorerst kein freier Personenverkehr mit Kroatien], SRF, 2014-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nzzhorizon&gt;[http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/schweiz/horizon-2020-auf-eis-gelegt-1.18244833 «Horizon 2020» auf Eis gelegt], NZZ, 2014-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/ek-suspendirala-pregovore-sa-svicarskom-zbog-hrvatske/1165641/ |title=Europska unija suspendirala pregovore sa Švicarskom zbog Hrvatske |trans-title=EU suspended negotiations with Switzerland because of Croatia |language=Croatian |accessdate=16 February 2014 |publisher=[[Jutarnji list]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 4, 2016, Switzerland and the EU signed a treaty that would extend the accord of the free movement of people to Croatia, something which would lead to Switzerland's full readmission into [[Horizon 2020]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Franklin | first1=Joshua | title=Swiss, EU Agree to Extend Free Movement Deal to Workers From Croatia | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-swiss-eu-immigration-croatia-idUSKCN0W60P7 | date=March 4, 2016 | publisher=''[[Reuters]]'' | accessdate=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Geiser | first1=Urs | title=Swiss Announce Unilateral Safeguard Clause to Curb Immigration | url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-agree-to-croatia-deal-to-save-eu-research-programme/42000888 | date=March 4, 2016 | publisher=''[[Swissinfo]]'' | accessdate=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty was ratified by the [[National Council (Switzerland)|National Council]] on April 26&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Swiss Lawmakers Back Croatia Free Movement Treaty | url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-eu-relations_swiss-lawmakers-back-croatia-free-movement-treaty/42115118 | date=April 26, 2016 | publisher=''[[Swissinfo]]'' | accessdate=April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the condition that a solution be found to an impasse on implementing the 2014 referendum.&lt;ref name="16.12.16Swissinfo"/&gt; The treaty was passed in December 2016.&lt;ref name="16.12.16Swissinfo"&gt;{{cite web | title=Swiss Extend Free Movement to Croatia After Immigration Vote | url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/new-immigration-law-clears-final-hurdle/42769316 | date=December 16, 2016 | publisher=[[Swissinfo]] | accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed Switzerland to rejoin Horizons 2020 on January 1, 2017.

==Implementation==
The Swiss government had three years to implement the referendum.&lt;ref name="Bishop"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Bishop | first1=Caroline | title=Switzerland’s Immigration Dilemma: What You Need to Know | url=http://www.thelocal.ch/20161206/switzerlands-immigration-dilemma-what-you-need-to-know | date=December 6, 2016 | publisher=''[[The Local]]'' | accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government attempted to implement the referendum without endangering its bilateral agreements with the EU, something that generated much controversy.&lt;ref name="Bishop"/&gt;

On December 12, 2016, the Swiss parliament agreed to a solution on how to implement the referendum,&lt;ref name="ReachesAgreement"&gt;{{cite web | title=Swiss Parliament Reaches Agreement on EU Immigration | url=http://www.thelocal.ch/20161213/swiss-parliament-reaches-agreement-on-eu-immigration | date=December 13, 2016 | publisher=''[[The Local]]'' | accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it formally voted on and approved the implementation on December 16.&lt;ref name="It'sOfficial"&gt;{{cite web | title=It's Official: Switzerland Defies Referendum and Won't Impose EU Immigration Controls | url=http://www.thelocal.ch/20161216/svp-bern-capitulates-with-final-immigration-vote | date=December 16, 2016 | publisher=''[[The Local]]'' | accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final measure was described as "watered down"&lt;ref name="ReachesAgreement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent15.12.16"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Osborne | first1=Samuel | last2=Broomfield | first2=Matt | title=Switzerland Waters Down Immigration Referendum to Protect EU Relationship | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/switzerland-immigration-referendum-result-reduce-water-down-protect-eu-relationship-migrant-a7476801.html | date=December 15, 2016 | publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' | accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as "a compromise" intended to appease the EU and not harm its relationship.&lt;ref name="BBC16.12.16"&gt;{{cite web | title=No Quotas in 'Compromise' Swiss Immigration Bill | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38340407 | date=December 16, 2016 | publisher=[[BBC]] | accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the 2014 referendum called for quotas,&lt;ref name="BBCQuotas"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26108597 "Swiss immigration: 50.3% back quotas, final results show"], BBC News, 9 February 2014 (page visited on 10 February 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; the accepted implementation did not include quotas but rather ordered employers to prioritize Swiss residents rather than foreign workers in locations where the unemployment rate is above average,&lt;ref name="It'sOfficial"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC16.12.16"/&gt; and it requires foreigners to demonstrate that they are integrated in Swiss society in order to receive a residence permit.&lt;ref name="Independent15.12.16"/&gt;

The accepted referendum implementation was harshly criticized by the [[Swiss People's Party]], which sponsored the original referendum. The party called the plan "a betrayal of voters' wishes"&lt;ref name="BBC16.12.16"/&gt; surrendering to EU pressure,&lt;ref name="It'sOfficial"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Upbeat"/&gt; and unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="It'sOfficial"/&gt; However, the SVP ruled out holding another referendum to force a stricter implementation of the referendum.&lt;ref name="BBC16.12.16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Swiss SVP Won't Call for Referendum Against New Immigration Law  | url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/swiss-svp-won-t-call-for-referendum-against-new-immigration-law/3351684.html | date=December 8, 2016 | publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]] (from [[Reuters]]) | accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media also criticized the implementation proposal for deviating so far from the legally-binding referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Swiss Press Criticize Bern’s 'Capitulation' on Immigration | url=http://www.thelocal.ch/20160922/swiss-press-criticize-berns-capitulation-on-immigration | date=September 22, 2016 | publisher=''[[The Local]]'' | accessdate=December 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Commission]], however, cautiously welcomed the implementation, stating that it "appears to go in the right direction,"&lt;ref name="Upbeat"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Shields | first1=Michael | last2=Blenkinsop | first2=Philip | title=Brussels Upbeat as Swiss Skirt Clash With EU on Immigration | url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-swiss-eu-idUKKBN1450S3 | date=December 16, 2016 | publisher=[[Reuters]] | accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about a week later it released a mostly positive statement concerning the implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Brussels Sees Progress in Ties with Bern After Immigration Law | url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/eu-swiss-relations_brussels-sees-progress-in-relations-with-bern/42786022 | date=December 22, 2016 | publisher=[[Swissinfo]] | accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed initiatives in response to the implementation proposal===
In an attempt to soften the immigration law further, in order to avoid conflict with the EU, the Swiss government proposed two alternatives to a proposed [[Popular initiative (Switzerland)|popular initiative]] to completely repeal the 2014 referendum.&lt;ref name="NewChoices"/&gt; The government's counterproposals, if approved by voters, would prohibit changing Swiss law if it would conflict with "international treaties of vital interest to Switzerland" or remove the three-year implementation limit, respectively.&lt;ref name="NewChoices"&gt;{{cite web | title=Voters Given New Choices in Swiss Immigration Saga | url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/government-proposals_voters-given-new-choices-in-swiss-immigration-saga-/42782014 | date=December 21, 2016 | publisher=[[Swissinfo]] | accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 28, 2016, a popular initiative to challenge the government's proposed implementation was launched by a [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democrat]]-member, acting as a private citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Swiss May Vote Again on Restricting Immigration | url=http://www.thelocal.ch/20161229/swiss-may-vote-again-on-restricting-immigration | date=December 29, 2016 | publisher=''[[The Local]]'' | accessdate=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did not reach the required number of signatures in the allotted timeframe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Immigration Initiative Challenge Fails | url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/not-enough-signatures_immigration-initiative-challenge-fails/43093554 | date=April 7, 2017 | publisher=[[Swissinfo]] | accessdate=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2017, four citizens' committees joined together to challenge the implementation proposal, which they saw as "not compatible with the 2014 initiative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Campaigners Demand Referendum on Swiss Government's Immigration Decision | url=http://www.thelocal.ch/20170125/campaigners-demand-referendum-on-swiss-governments-immigration-decision | date=January 25, 2017 | publisher=''[[The Local]]'' | accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tertiary Institutes Allied Staff Assoc Inc v Tahana''''' [1998] 1 NZLR 41 is a cited case in [[New Zealand]] regarding the legal defence of judicial proceedings regarding defamation claims in [[tort]].&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=6th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=9781877511400|year=2010 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Unhappy with the performance of the Chief Executive Mr Tahana, of the [[Waiariki (New Zealand electorate)|Waiariki]] polytech, the Tertiary Institutes Allied Staff Association lodged a complaint with the polytech's council.

As a result of this complaint, Tahana sued the association for [[defamation]]. They in turn defended the claim on the grounds of being absolutely privileged under section 14 of the Defamation Act, which covers matters raised judicially, such as a court proceedings.

==Held==
The court held that the Polytech's tribunal did not meet the threshold of being "judicial", and the associations defence failed.

The '''Uniform Securities Agent State Law Examination''', commonly referred to as the Series 63, is developed by [[North American Securities Administrators Association]] (NASAA) and is administered by the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA).  The examination is designed to qualify candidates as securities agents in the United States; nearly all states require individuals to pass the Series 63 as a condition of state registration.

The Uniform Securities Agent State Law Examination consists of 65 multiple-choice questions. Applicants are allowed 75 minutes to complete the examination.  Applicants must attain scores of 72% in order to pass. Credit is only given for correct answers. Of the 65 questions on the exam, 60 will count toward the final score. The remaining 5 questions are being pre-tested for possible inclusion in the operational question bank; these questions may appear anywhere in the exam and are not identified.

The examination covers the principles of state securities regulation reflected in the [[Uniform Securities Act]] (with the amendments adopted by NASAA and rules prohibiting dishonest and unethical business practices). The examination is intended to provide a basis for state securities administrators to determine an applicant's knowledge and understanding of state law and regulations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6771">'''Walter Bosse''' (November 13, 1904 &amp;ndash; December 13, 1979) was a [[Vienna|Viennese]] artist, designer, [[ceramist]], [[pottery|potter]], metalworker, and craftsman noted for his [[modernist]] [[bronze]] animal [[figurines]] and [[grotesques]].

== Early life ==
Walter Bosse, born November 13, 1904, in Vienna, was the son of artists Luise and Julius Bosse. His father worked as a portrait painter at the [[Emperor of Austria#The Imperial Court|imperial court]]. 

Walter Bosse attended the ''Wiener [[Kunstgewerbeschule]]'', now the [[University of Applied Arts Vienna]], from 1918 to 1921, where he studied ceramics under [[Michael Powolny]], and ornament under [[Franz Cižek]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} He then attended the Munich School of Applied Arts (Münchner Kunstgewerbeschule).{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} During his schooling he was given the opportunity to sell his work at the [[Wiener Werkstätte]] by [[Josef Hoffmann]], who became a mentor to Bosse. Bosse opened his own shop in [[Kufstein]] in 1923.&lt;ref name="worldcat"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schreyer-Hartmann|first=Cherica|title=Walter Bosse: Leben, Kunst und Handwerk 1904-1979|year=2000|publisher=Brandstätter|location=Vienna|isbn=9783854980711|pages=168|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/walter-bosse-leben-kunst-und-handwerk-1904-1979/oclc/48003547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Bosse’s work grew in popularity and a number of his pieces were shown at the [[International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts]] in 1925. He started designing for [[Augarten porcelain|Augarten Porcelain]] Works (1924)&lt;ref name="augarten"&gt;{{cite web|title=Augarten Artists: Walter Bosse|url=http://www.augarten.at/en/history/augarten-artists/walter-bosse/}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Goldscheider ceramics|Goldscheider]] (1926) and [[:de:Porzellanfabrik Metzler &amp; Ortloff|Metzler and Ortloff]] (1927). In 1931, to meet increasing demand (especially in America), Bosse opened up a bigger shop in Kufstein, but by 1933 he started to feel the effects of the economic depression. By 1937, the Kufstein works were closed.&lt;ref name="worldcat" /&gt;

In 1938, now divorced, Bosse moved back to Vienna, where he founded Bosse Ceramics (Bosse-Keramik), which expanded under the new name “Terra” to include glass, toys, textiles. and a variety of craft items for the gift market. In the late 1940s, Bosse began experimenting with [[brass]] by giving his ceramic figures a metal coating to protect them from breakage. 

He formed a partnership with [[Hertha Baller]], whose company (the Hertha Baller Company) manufactured and marketed the brass figurines, this collaboration was called the Bosse/Baller company.&lt;ref name="R&amp;M"&gt;{{cite book | last = Robinson &amp; Meadows | title = Austrian Figural Corkscrew Design: Auböck ∙ Bosse ∙ Hagenauer ∙ Rohac | publisher = Kitsilano Cellars | location = Vancouver | year = 2015 | isbn = 978-0-9689294-1-4  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.modernviennabronze.com/virtual-museum|title=Virtual Museum|last=|first=|date=|website=Modern Vienna Bronze|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-17|quote="...the original collection of the Bosse/Baller company in Austria"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1950s, Bosse and Baller began exploring a new style of brass called the “Black Gold Line” or "Black Golden Line" of brass figurines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.makersandbrothers.com/makers/walter-bosse-makers-brass/|title=Walter Bosse|website=Makers &amp; Brothers|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He transitioned all of his efforts to brass and the figures became popular worldwide.&lt;ref name="worldcat" /&gt; Despite Bosse's success with his brass figures, it was still a difficult time for him financially. In 1953, partly fleeing from financial troubles, he moved to [[Iserlohn]], Germany where he set up a new shop and continued production. In Vienna, the Herta Baller Company continued to make and sell Bosse's designs.&lt;ref name="R&amp;M" /&gt; Bosse also collaborated with [[Karlsruhe]] State Majolika Works on a number of pottery animal figures.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} 

In 1958, he designed for [[Achatit Schirmer]] in [[Cologne]].&lt;ref name="worldcat" /&gt; Bosse also turned his efforts to small, everyday items such as letter openers, keyrings, corkscrews, and pencil holders, all of which bear the distinctive "black and gold" look. 

== Death and legacy ==
A number of Bosse’s designs began to gain widespread popularity internationally, particularly his brass hedgehog ashtrays and hand-shaped bowls. But the designs' success led to forgeries popping up worldwide. His hedgehog ashtrays were reproduced by many forgers in various countries and with varying degrees of precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zukas|first=Alyssa|title=Authenticating Your Walter Bosse Hedgehog Ashtrays: How to Spot the Differences|url=http://www.modernviennabronze.com/walter-bosse-news/authenticating-your-walter-bosse-hedgehog-ashtrays-how-to-spot-the-differences}}&lt;/ref&gt; To protect his designs, he engaged in court battles which would last the rest of his life and deplete most of his money. Because of these cases, he is considered to be a seminal figure relating to modern [[copyright]] law for designer goods.&lt;ref name="worldcat" /&gt;

The last years of Bosse’s life saw him devoting much of his time and money to his legal disputes and on December 17, 1979, Bosse died with no money to his name in Iserlohn, Germany.
