      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7606">'''Aostan French''' ({{lang-fr|français valdôtain}}) is the variety of French spoken in the [[Aosta Valley]], Italy.

== History ==

The Aosta Valley was the first government authority to adopt Modern French as working language in 1536, three years before [[France]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.paysdaoste.eu/la-valle-d-aosta-un-po-di-storia/7-marzo-1536/|title=Pays d'Aoste - 7 marzo 1536|website=www.paysdaoste.eu|language=it|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; French has been the official language of the [[Aosta Valley]] since 1561, when it replaced Latin.&lt;ref&gt;''Langue et littérature en Vallée d'Aoste au XVIe siècle'', Système Valdôtain des Bibliothèques.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1861 census, the first held after the unification of Italy, 93% declared being Francophone; in 1921, the last census with a question about language found that 88% of the population was French-speaking.&lt;ref&gt;''Une Vallée d'Aoste bilingue dans une Europe plurilingue'', Fondation Émile Chanoux.&lt;/ref&gt; The suppression of all French-language schools and institutions and violence against French speakers during the forcible [[Italianisation]] campaign of the [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Fascist government]] irretrievably damaged the status of French in the region. Italian and French are nowadays the region's [[official language]]s&lt;ref&gt;Statut spécial de la Vallée d'Aoste, Article 38, Title VI, [http://www.regione.vda.it/amministrazione/autonomia/statutospeciale/titolo6_f.asp Weblink] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123140642/http://www.regione.vda.it/amministrazione/autonomia/statutospeciale/titolo6_f.asp |date=January 23, 2013 }}, access date: 5-11-2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and are used for the regional government's acts and laws, though Italian is much more widely spoken in everyday life, and French is mostly used by intellectuals and within cultural events. Though French was re-introduced as an official language after World War II, by 2003 just 0.99% reported speaking [[standard French]] natively. French remains widely known as a second language, but it is no longer spoken as part of daily life.{{sfn|OIF|2014|p=12}} In 2001, 75.41% of the population of Aosta Valley was French-speaking, 96.01% declared to know Italian, 55.77% [[Franco-Provençal]], and 50.53% all of them.&lt;ref&gt;Assessorat de l'éducation et la culture de la région autonome Vallée d'Aoste - Département de la surintendance des écoles, ''Profil de la politique linguistique éducative'', Le Château éd., 2009, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; School education is delivered equally in both Italian and French so that everyone who went to school in Aosta Valley can speak French and Italian at least at a medium-high level.

==Influences==
Aostan French is characterized by terms adopted from the [[valdôtain|patois francoprovençal valdôtain]] and sometimes from [[italian language|Italian]]. In this sense, it is quite similar to [[Savoyard dialect]] and to [[valaisan dialect]] as spoken in [[Valais]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.patoisvda.org/gna/index.cfm/francoprovencal-geographie-territoires-patois.html|title=géographie et territoires du francoprovençal|website=www.patoisvda.org|language=fr|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ashley Madison''', or '''The Ashley Madison Agency''', is a [[Canada|Canadian]] online dating service and social networking service marketed to people who are married or in relationships.

It was founded in 2002 by Darren Morgenstern, with the slogan: "Life is short. Have an [[affair]]."&lt;ref name="latime"&gt;{{cite web|last=Daum |first=Meghan |date=January 10, 2009 |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-daum10-2009jan10,0,7649415.column |title=Ashley Madison's secret success |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=2010-01-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215103316/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-daum10-2009jan10%2C0%2C7649415.column |archivedate=February 15, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name comes from two [[List of most popular given names|popular female names]] in [[North America]], "[[Ashley (name)|Ashley]]" and "[[Madison (name)|Madison]]."&lt;ref name="latime" /&gt;

The company received  attention on July 15, 2015, after [[hacker (computer security)|hackers]] [[Ashley Madison data breach|stole all of its customer data]]—including emails, names, home addresses, sexual fantasies and credit card information—and threatened to post the data online if Ashley Madison and fellow [[Avid Life Media]] site EstablishedMen.com were not permanently closed. By July 22, the first set of customer names were released by hackers,&lt;ref name="cbs72215"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hackers expose first Ashley Madison users|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hackers-expose-first-ashley-madison-users/|accessdate=2015-07-23|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with all of the user data released on August 18, 2015. More data (including some of the CEO's emails) was released on August 20, 2015. The release included data from customers who had previously paid a $19 fee to Ashley Madison to supposedly have their data deleted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2015/08/happened-hackers-posted-stolen-ashley-madison-data/ Hackers Finally Post Stolen Ashley Madison Data], wired, 2015-08-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The fee was also applied to people who had accounts set up against their will, as a workplace [[prank]], or because of a mistyped email address.&lt;ref name=firstlook&gt;{{cite web|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/07/21/ashley-madison-breach-why-am-i-getting-their-emails/|title=Some Dude Created an Ashley Madison Account Linked to My Gmail, and All I Got Was This Lousy Extortion Screen|work=The Intercept|accessdate=2015-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 28, 2015, [[Noel Biderman]] agreed to step down as chief executive officer of Avid Life Media Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ashley Madison CEO Noel Biderman resigns after third leak of emails|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/28/ashley-madison-neil-biderman-stepping-down|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-26|first = Sam Thielman in New|last = York}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statement released by the firm said his departure was "in the best interest of the company".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/34090372|title=Ashley Madison founder steps down|publisher=BBC News|date=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, parent company Avid Life Media re-branded itself to [[Ruby Corp.]] and appointed Rob Segal as its new CEO.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/11/05/ashley-madison-gets-an-open-minded-facelift.html "Ashley Madison gets an ‘open-minded’ facelift"].

The company announced plans to launch in [[Singapore]] in 2014.&lt;ref name=mypapersg&gt;{{cite web|title=Business of ruining marriages |url=http://mypaper.sg/news/business-ruining-marriages-20131023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027110920/http://mypaper.sg/news/business-ruining-marriages-20131023 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 27, 2013 |first=Jacqueline |last=Woo |date=October 23, 2013 |work=[[My Paper]] |accessdate=2013-10-24 |quote=The dating website that facilitates extramarital affairs between married individuals plans for a launch in Singapore next year, My Paper understands.  The Canada-based website has over 21 million users worldwide. Its slogan: "Life is short. Have an affair."  Ashley Madison has already expanded to other Asian countries and territories such as Japan, and, more recently, Hong Kong in August. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Singapore's Media Development Authority (MDA) announced that it will not allow Ashley Madison to operate in Singapore as "it promotes adultery and disregards family values".&lt;ref name=ChannelNewsAsia&gt;{{cite web| title = MDA will block access to Ashley Madison website | url= http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mda-will-block-access-to/879898.html?cid=FBSG| date= November 8, 2013| publisher= [[Channel NewsAsia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==
Unlike [[Match.com]] or [[eHarmony]], Ashley Madison's business model is based on credits rather than monthly subscriptions. For a conversation between two members, one of the members—almost always the man—must pay five credits to initiate the conversation. Any follow-up messages between the two members are free after the communication has been initiated. Ashley Madison also has a real-time chat feature where credits buy a certain time allotment.

The site allows users to hide their account profiles for free. Users looking to delete their accounts, even those made without the individual's consent, are charged a $19 fee.&lt;ref name="firstlook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AshleyMadison"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.ashleymadison.com/app/public/tandc.p?c=3|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150722170716/https://www.ashleymadison.com/app/public/tandc.p?c=3|title = Ashley Madison Terms _Conditions|publisher = Ashley Madison|date = October 21, 2013|accessdate = 2015-08-25|archivedate = July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "full delete" option claims to remove user profiles, all messages sent and received, site usage history, personally identifiable information, and photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ashley Madison's $19 'full delete' option made the company millions|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/19/9178479/ashley-madison-full-delete-made-millions|accessdate=2015-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data disclosures in 2015 revealed that this "permanent deletion" feature did not permanently delete anything, and all data was recoverable.

==Criticism==
Trish McDermott, a consultant who helped found Match.com, accused Ashley Madison of being a "business built on the back of broken hearts, ruined marriages, and damaged families". Biderman responded by stating that the site is "just a platform" and a website or a commercial will not convince anyone to commit [[adultery]].&lt;ref name=latime/&gt;&lt;ref name=timemag&gt;{{cite news| last=Caplan | first=Jeremy | date=June 28, 2008|url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1907542,00.html |title= Cheating 2.0: New Mobile Apps Make Adultery Easier| work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]| accessdate= 2010-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Biderman, affairs help preserve many marriages.&lt;ref name="e27"&gt;{{cite web| title=11 titillating minutes with Ashley Madison renders me impressed | url=http://e27.co/11-titillating-minutes-with-ashley-madison-renders-me-impressed| first=Elaine |last=Huang | date= November 25, 2013| work=[[e27 (blog)|e27]] |access-date=2014-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guarantee===
Ashley Madison offers a guarantee that users will "find someone": "we GUARANTEE that you will successfully find what you're looking for or we'll give you your money back"&lt;ref&gt;"Is Ashley Madison a scam? Is Ashley Madison a fraud?" {{cite web|url=https://www.ashleymadison.com/articles/ashley-madison-scam.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907075203/https://www.ashleymadison.com/articles/ashley-madison-scam.html |archivedate=September 7, 2015 |df=mdy }}, retrieved 2014-08-17&lt;/ref&gt; In order to qualify, users must  purchase the most expensive package, send more expensive "priority" messages to 18 unique members each month for three months, send 5 Ashley Madison gifts per month, and engage in 60 minutes of paid chat per month. Compounding the problem is that "more men than women use the service, with the disparity increasing as they advance in age", and "Men seek sex, while women seek passion."&lt;ref&gt;Niv Elis, "Cheating on your spouse in Israel just got easier", "Jerusalem Post", May 22, 2014, http://www.jpost.com/Business/Business-News/Cheating-on-your-spouse-in-Israel-just-got-easier-353123&lt;/ref&gt; A page on Ashley Madison, entitled "Is Ashley Madison a scam? Is Ashley Madison a fraud?" addressed some of these issues in an attempt to win over prospective customers and teach them best practices for using the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Ashley Madison a scam? Is Ashley Madison a fraud? |url=https://www.ashleymadison.com/articles/ashley-madison-scam.html |website=Ashley Madison |accessdate=2014-08-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907075203/https://www.ashleymadison.com/articles/ashley-madison-scam.html |archivedate=September 7, 2015 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Segal and Millership phased out the guarantee feature on July 5, 2016. It no longer appears on the company website, advertising or promotion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Fake female bots accounts===
According to [[Annalee Newitz]], Editor-in-Chief of [[Gizmodo]], who has analyzed the 2015 leaked data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gizmodo.com/the-fembots-of-ashley-madison-1726670394 |title=The FemBots of Ashley Madison |publisher=[[Gizmodo]] |last=Newitz|first=Annalee|date=August 27, 2015 |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashley Madison had over 70,000 [[chatterbot|bots]] sending fake female messages to male users. She had previously released an analysis purporting to show that only a minuscule proportion (12,000 out of 5.5 million) registered female accounts were used on a regular basis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pelt|first1=Mason|title=Ashley Madison "the most interesting hack" says John McAfee|url=http://siliconangle.com/blog/2015/11/09/ashley-madison-the-most-interesting-hack-says-john-mcafee/|website=siliconangle.com|publisher=SiliconANGLE|accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reed/&gt;&lt;ref name=reed&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/s/most-hilarious-revelation-ashley-madison-hack-yet-031557791.html |title=The most hilarious revelation about the Ashley Madison hack yet |publisher=[[Yahoo!

Newitz noted a clause in the terms of service which states that "many profiles are for 'amusement only'".&lt;ref name=gallagher/&gt;

In 2012, a former employee claimed in a lawsuit that she was requested to create thousands of fake female accounts attractive to male customers, resulting in repetitive stress injury.  The case settled out of court.&lt;ref name=gallagher/&gt;

In July 2016, CEO Rob Segal and newly appointed President James Millership told [[Reuters]] that the company had phased out bots by late 2015. Segal shared an independent report by EY (Ernst &amp; Young) which verified the phase-out.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ashleymadison-cyber-idUSKCN0ZL09J|title=Infidelity website Ashley Madison facing FTC probe, CEO apologizes|date=July 5, 2016|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/ashleymadison-branding-marketing-1.3679038|title=She's back: Relaunched Ashley Madison aims to help cheaters 'find your moment'|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advertising===
Ashley Madison employs [[guerrilla marketing]] techniques to advertise its site. One such technique has been the creation of fake criticism websites filled with ads for Ashley Madison and anonymous testimony that the site is legitimate. For example, the site "www.AshleyMadisonScams.com" was registered to Ashley Madison owner Avid Life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2011/02/11/ashley-madison-lessons-in-promoting-a-sleazy-business/ |title=Ashley Madison: Lessons In Promoting a Sleazy Business |date=February 12, 2011 |first=Kashmir |last=Hill |publisher=''[[Forbes]]'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashley Madison advertises with [[TV commercial]]s, [[billboard]]s, and radio ads by the CEO, [[Noel Biderman]].&lt;ref name=latime/&gt; TV ads, described as cringe-worthy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/australian-ad-standards-board-upholds-complaints-about-ashley-madison-ad-2015-3|title=Here's the cringe-worthy ad for affair site Ashley Madison that was pulled for 'vilifying women'|author=Lara O'Reilly|work=Business Insider Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been pulled from the air in some countries after frequent complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mumbrella.com.au/tv-ad-for-infidelity-dating-website-ashley-madison-pulled-from-air-27251|title=TV ad for infidelity dating website Ashley Madison pulled from air|work=mUmBRELLA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mumbrella.com.au/ashley-madison-ad-degrading-to-wives-rules-ad-standards-board-279894|title=Ashley Madison ad degrading to wives, rules Ad Standards Board|work=mUmBRELLA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some proposals turned down by the companies approached include a €1.5 million [[Jersey (clothing)|jersey]] [[Sports marketing#Sponsorship of teams|sponsorship deal]] with [[Lega Basket Serie A|Italian]] [[basketball]] club [[Pallacanestro Virtus Roma|Virtus Roma]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ballineurope.com/us-basketball/nba/andrea-bargnani-denies-virtus-roma-ashley-madison-rumors-5505/#more-10260 |title=Andrea Bargnani: Don't Believe the Hype About Virtus Roma, Ashley Madison, and Me |publisher=BallInEurope.com |date=November 20, 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404194101/http://www.ballineurope.com/us-basketball/nba/andrea-bargnani-denies-virtus-roma-ashley-madison-rumors-5505/#more-10260 |archivedate=April 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a $10 million offer to rename Phoenix's [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport|Sky Harbor Airport]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Wong | first = Scott | title = Phoenix rejects $10M offer from infidelity Web site | work = The Arizona Republic | date = February 22, 2010 | url = http://www.azcentral.com/members/Blog/PHXBeat/74536 | accessdate = 2010-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Fisher |first=Katie |title=Risque website offers $10 million for Sky Harbor name change |publisher=ABC15 |date=February 23, 2010 |url=http://www.abc15.com/content/news/phoenixmetro/central/story/Risque-website-offers-10-million-for-Sky-Harbor/z4uPlkToaEy6HGHAl2IqOQ.cspx |accessdate=2010-03-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225054012/http://www.abc15.com/content/news/phoenixmetro/central/story/Risque-website-offers-10-million-for-Sky-Harbor/z4uPlkToaEy6HGHAl2IqOQ.cspx |archivedate=February 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an offer for the [[naming rights]] of [[MetLife Stadium|New Meadowlands Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2010/06/09/nfl-new-york-jets-new-york-giants-stadium-meadowlands-ashley-madison-cheaters-adultery-website/ |title=NFL Stadium Offered $25M to Promote Adultery |publisher=TMZ.com |date=May 30, 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100811083622/http://www.tmz.com/2010/06/09/nfl-new-york-jets-new-york-giants-stadium-meadowlands-ashley-madison-cheaters-adultery-website/| archivedate= August 11, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement denouncing proposed ads was made in 2009 when Ashley Madison attempted to purchase [[C$]]200,000 worth of advertising from the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] (TTC) on the [[Toronto streetcar system]].&lt;ref name=toro&gt;{{cite web| last=Peat | first=Don | date=December 11, 2009 |url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/torontoandgta/2009/12/11/12122821.html|title= TTC dumps Ashley Madison| work= [[Toronto Sun]]| accessdate= 2010-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; With five of six committee members voting against it, the commissioner stated "When it's a core fundamental value around cheating or lying, we're not going to let those kinds of ads go on."&lt;ref name=bnet&gt;{{cite web| last= Edwards | first=Jim | date=December 16, 2009|url=http://industry.bnet.com/advertising/10005030/no-streetcars-named-desire-toronto-bans-adultery-ads-on-public-transit/|title= No Streetcars Named Desire: Toronto Bans Adultery Ads on Public Transit| publisher= bnet.com| accessdate= 2010-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biderman offered to subsidize the TTC fare rate to $2.50 from $2.75 but the offer was declined.

Also in 2009, [[NBC]] refused an ad submitted by Ashley Madison for the network's broadcast of [[Super Bowl XLIII]].&lt;ref name=nydailynews&gt;{{cite web| last=Hill| first=Catey | date= January 29, 2009|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2009/01/28/2009-01-28_banned_these_ads_are_too_racy_for_the_su-1.html |title= Banned!

==Lawsuits==
In 2012, the company was sued by former employee Doriana Silva, who stated that in preparation for the launch of the company's Portuguese-language website, she was assigned to create over a thousand bogus member profiles within a three-week period in order to attract paying customers, and that this caused her to develop [[repetitive stress injury]]. The lawsuit claimed that as a result Silva "developed severe pain in her wrists and forearms," and has been unable to work since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.citynews.ca/2013/11/10/woman-hurt-typing-fake-profiles-for-dating-site-20m-suit-alleges|title=Woman hurt typing fake profiles for dating site, $20M suit alleges|work= [[CityNews]]|author= Paola Loriggio|date= November 10, 2013|accessdate=2013-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company countersued, alleging fraud. The company claimed that Silva had been photographed [[Jet Ski#Common noun|jet-skiing]], an activity that was unlikely for someone who had suffered serious injury to the hands and forearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ashley-madison-strikes-back-against-plaintiff-2013-11 |title=Ashley Madison Says Woman Who Alleges She Hurt Her Wrists Writing Fake Profiles Later Rode A Jet Ski|work= [[Business Insider]]|author= Jim Edwards|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashley Madison later alleged further that Silva had kept confidential documents and sought to retrieve them.

In 2015, the Ontario Superior Court dismissed the case without costs, a result with which Avi Weisman, vice-president and general counsel for Avid Life Media, said the company was "very pleased."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/lawsuit-against-dating-site-for-married-people-seeking-affairs-dismissed/article22511386/ Lawsuit against dating site for married people seeking affairs dismissed], at The Globe And Mail; published January 18, 2015. Retrieved April 13, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, after its customer records were [[Ashley Madison data breach|leaked by hackers]], a $576 million class-action lawsuit was filed against the company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34032760 Ashley Madison faces huge class-action lawsuit – 23 August 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data breach==  
{{main|Ashley Madison data breach}}
On July 15, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/07/online-cheating-site-ashleymadison-hacked/ |title=Online Cheating Site AshleyMadison Hacked |publisher=krebsonsecurity.com |date=July 15, 2015 |accessdate=2015-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the site was hacked by a group known as "The Impact Team". Claiming that its security had always been weak, the hackers claimed to have stolen personal information about the site's user base, and threatened to release names, home addresses, search histories and credit card numbers if the site was not immediately shut down.

'''Bewegung Nurr''' is an artists' collective that operates in the fields of sculpture, installation art, graffiti, video art, photography, and painting. The collective was founded in [[Dresden]], [[Germany]] in 1989.

==Work==
[[File:Bewegung Nurr 17 Fremde.jpg|thumbnail|17 Strangers, Sandstone sculpture group in Dresden, 1995]]
The collective explores issues having to do with capitalism and media in the context of [[post-industrial society]], and their work has been described as displaying "parodistic elegance between gravity and levity, comedy and catastrophe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elegant zwischen Ernst und Unsinn|url=http://www.sz-online.de/nachrichten/elegant-zwischen-ernst-und-unsinn-971616.html|accessdate=28 September 2013|newspaper=Sächsische Zeitung|date=September 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the collective ranges from graffiti in [[Äußere Neustadt|Dresden Neustadt]] in the early 1990s to the sculpture, videos, painting, and installations of today. The strategies of subversion Bewegung Nurr employed often referenced the work of other artist groups of the 80's and 90's, such as [[General Idea]] and [[Die Tödliche Doris]].

[[File:Bewegung Nurr Trollmann Viktoriapark.jpg|thumb|''9841- Temporary memorial für Johann Rukeli Trollmann'' in Berlin-Kreuzberg, 2010]]
In 2010 and 2011, Bewegung Nurr erected a temporary memorial to the [[Sinto]] German boxing champion [[Johann Wilhelm Trollmann]]. Trollmann won the German light-heavyweight title in 1933, but was stripped of his victory by the Nazis, sterilized, arrested by the [[Gestapo]], and finally murdered in [[Neuengamme concentration camp]]. The memorial erected by Bewegung Nurr, titled "9841", was first displayed on June 9, 2010 in [[Viktoriapark]], Berlin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Fight for Memory: Monument Honors Sinti Boxer Murdered by the Nazis|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/a-fight-for-memory-monument-honors-sinti-boxer-murdered-by-the-nazis-a-702938.html|accessdate=28 September 2013|newspaper=Spiegel Online International|date=June 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;—the anniversary of the day in 1933 when Trollmann won his light-heavyweight boxing title. The memorial was displayed again in Hannover in 2011 on the Ballhofplatz.

In July 2014, Bewegung Nurr created the project "Haus der 28 Türen" ("The House of the 28 Doors"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.28doors.eu/english/|title=BEWEGUNG NURR: THE HOUSE OF THE 28 DOORS|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pavilion erected on Tempelhof Field in Berlin as a memorial to refugees who lost their lives attempting to enter Europe. The structure was later moved to Oranienplatz in Berlin, where it fell victim to arson on March 31, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brandanschlag auf Flüchtlings-Kunstprojekt in Berlin|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/brandanschlag-auf-fluechtlings-kunstprojekt-in-berlin,10809148,30264448.html|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caribbean Hindustani''' or '''Caribbean Hindi-Urdu''' is an [[Indo-Aryan language]] historically spoken as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' by [[Indo-Caribbean]]s and the Indo-Caribbean diaspora. It is based on [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]] with influences from [[Awadhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{e19|hns}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were spoken by [[Indian indenture system|indentured laborers]] who came as immigrants to the [[Caribbean]] from the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It is closely related to [[Fijian Hindi]], the Bhojpuri spoken in [[Mauritius]] and the Hindustani spoken in [[South Africa]].

Because a majority of people came from [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], and [[Jharkhand]], Caribbean Hindustani is most influenced by [[Bhojpuri]], [[Awadhi language|Awadhi]], [[Braj Bhasha]], and other [[Bihari languages|Bihari dialects]]. It has a very minor influence from [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], and other [[Dravidian languages]]. It has also borrowed a large number of words from [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in [[Suriname]] and other [[Dutch colonies]], and [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] in former [[British colonies]] and [[French colonies]]. A large number of words, unique to Caribbean Hindustani, have been created to cater for the new environment that Indo-Caribbeans now live in. 

Caribbean Hindustani is the ''lingua franca'' of most Indo-Caribbeans, although [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] are the ''[[lingua franca|lingua francas]]'' for [[Indian people|Indians]] in [[French Guiana]], [[Martinique]], and [[Guadeloupe]]; where a majority of the [[Indian people|Indians]] are of [[Dravidian people|Dravidian (South Indian)]] descent.

Like the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] spoken in the Indian subcontinent, Caribbean Hindustani is broken up into Caribbean [[Hindi]] and Caribbean [[Urdu]]. [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] refers to both Hindi and Urdu. Hindi is spoken by [[Hindu]]s and people of Hindu descent, whereas Urdu is spoken by [[Muslim]]s and people of Muslim descent. Hindi has more influence from [[Sanskrit]], while Urdu has more influence from [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. Hindi is written in the [[Devanagari]], [[Devanagari Braille]], and [[Kaithi]] script, whereas Urdu is written in the [[Perso-Arabic script]] and [[Urdu Braille]], although in more recent times they both are written in the [[Latin script]] and [[English Braille]]. 

[[Chutney music]], [[Chutney Soca|chutney soca]], [[Chutney parang|chutney parang]], [[Baithak Gana|baithak gana]], [[Indian folk music|folk music]], [[Indian classical music|classical music]], some [[Hindu music|Hindu religious songs]], some [[Islamic music|Muslim religious songs]], and some [[Christian music|Christian religious songs]] are sung in Caribbean Hindustani, sometimes being mixed with [[Caribbean English|English]] in the [[Commonwealth Caribbean|Anglophone Caribbean]] or [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in [[Suriname]] and the [[Dutch Caribbean]].

==Guyanese Hindustani==
The Caribbean Hindustani of [[Guyana]] is known as ''Aili Gaili'' (Aaye-Gaye [I] Came-Gone is spoken as Aili-Gaili in [[Bhojpuri]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]] and [[Awadhi]] and almost all dialects of [[Bihar]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Jharkhand]] (meaning broken or corrupted language) or ''Guyanese Hindustani'' and is spoken by some members in a community of 300,000 Indo-Guyanese.

== Trinidadian Hindustani ==
The variant that used to be spoken in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] is known as ''Trinidadian Hindustani'' or ''Trinidadian Bhojpuri''. There is about 26,000 speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ethnologue.com/18/country/TT/languages/ | title=Trinidad and Tobago | publisher=Ethnologue.com | accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.guardian.co.tt/lifestyle/10000-students-graduate-hindi-6.2.449105.73f9770ef7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sarnami Hindustani==
''Sarnami Hindustani'' meaning ''Surinamese Hindustani'' is the most widely spoken language in Suriname after Dutch and [[Sranan Tongo]], the two ''[[lingua franca]]s''. It is a  distinct dialect of the [[Bhojpuri language]] (the language spoken in north Indian states [[Bihar]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Jharkhand]]) with heavy lexical influence from other languages spoken in Suriname. It is mainly spoken by and within Suriname’s [[Indo-Surinamese]] (cca. 27% of the population) community and therefore it is not considered to be a third lingua franca.

''[[Baithak Gana]]'' is the most famous form of the song being sung in Sarnami Hindustani.

[[File:Academy of Classical Design ~ Cast Hall.jpg|thumb|300px|Academy of Classical Design, Cast Studio - Southern Pines, NC.]]
'''Classical Realism''' refers to an artistic movement in late-20th and early 21st century in which [[drawing]] and [[painting]] place a high value upon [[skill]] and [[beauty]], combining elements of 19th-century [[neoclassicism]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]].

==Origins==

[[Image:Jean-Leon Gerome Pollice Verso.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]. ''[[Pollice Verso]]'' (1872). Classical Realism traces its lineage from Gérôme.]]

The term "Classical Realism" first appeared as a description of literary style, as in an 1882 criticism of [[John Milton|Milton]]'s poetry.&lt;ref&gt;S. Birch, ''The Educational Times''. Vol. 35, No. 249, January 1, 1882, page 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Its usage relating to the visual arts dates back to at least 1905 in a reference to [[Masaccio]]'s paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Mahler, Arthur; Blacker; Carlos; Slater, William Albert. ''Paintings of the Louvre, Italian and Spanish'', Doubleday, 1905, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; It originated as the title of a contemporary but traditional artistic movement with Richard Lack (1928–2009), who was a pupil of Boston artist [[R. H. Ives Gammell]] (1893–1981) during the early 1950s. Ives Gammell had studied with [[William McGregor Paxton]] (1869–1941) and Paxton had studied with 19th-century French artist, [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1824–1904). In 1967 Lack established Atelier Lack, a studio-school of fine art patterned after the ateliers of 19th-century Paris and the teaching of the Boston impressionists. By 1980 he had trained a significant group of young painters. In 1982, they organized a traveling exhibition of their work and that of other artists within the artistic tradition represented by Gammell, Lack and their students. Lack was asked by Vern Swanson, director of the [[Springville Museum of Art]], [[Springville, Utah]], (the exhibition's originating venue), to coin a term that would differentiate the realism of the heirs of the Boston tradition from that of other representational artists. Although he was reluctant to label this work, Lack chose the expression "Classical Realism." It was first used in the title of that exhibition: ''Classical Realism: The Other Twentieth Century''. The term, "Classical Realism", was originally intended to describe work that combined the fine drawing and design of the European academic tradition as exemplified by Gérôme with the observed color values of the American Boston tradition as exemplified by Paxton.

In 1985 Atelier Lack began publishing the ''Classical Realism Quarterly'', featuring articles written by Richard Lack and his students to educate and inform the public about traditional representational painting. In 1988 Lack and several associates founded The American Society of Classical Realism, a society organized to preserve and promote fine representational art. The ASCR functioned until 2005 and published the influential ''Classical Realism Journal'' and ''Classical Realism Newsletter.''

In a separate vein, another major contributor to the revival of traditional drawing and painting knowledge is the painter and  art instructor Ted Seth Jacobs (born 1927), who taught students at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] and the New York Academy of Art in New York City.&lt;ref name="jacobs"&gt;Jacobs, Ted Seth.  ''Light for the Artist'',  Watson-Guptill Pubns (June 1988), {{ISBN|0-8230-2768-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their lineage is rooted in the [[Académie Julian]], the Golden Age of Illustration in New York, and the School of Paris. In 1987 Ted Seth Jacobs created his own art school, L'Ecole Albert Defois in Les Cerqueux sous Passavant, France (49).  Many of Jacobs' students such as Anthony Ryder and Jacob Collins became influential teachers and acquired their own student following.&lt;ref name="ryder"&gt;Ryder, Anthony.  ''The Artist's Complete Guide to Figure Drawing: A Contemporary Perspective on the Classical Tradition'',  Watson-Guptill; 1st edition (June 1, 1999), {{ISBN|0-8230-0303-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and philosophy==

Classical Realism is characterized by love for the visible world and the great traditions of Western art, including [[Classicism]], [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and [[Impressionism]].  The movement's aesthetic is Classical in that it exhibits a preference for order, beauty, harmony and completeness; it is Realist because its primary subject matter comes from the representation of nature based on the artist's observation.&lt;ref name="lack"&gt;Gjertson, Stephen.  ''Richard F. Lack: An American Master'',  American Society of Classical Realism: 2001, {{ISBN|0-9636180-3-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists in this genre strive to draw and paint from  the direct observation of nature, and eschew the use of photography or other mechanical aids. In this regard, Classical Realism differs from the art movements of [[Photorealism]] and  [[Hyperrealism (painting)|Hyperrealism]]. Stylistically, classical realists employ methods used by both [[Impressionist]] and [[Academic art]]ists.

Classical Realist painters have attempted to restore curricula of training that develop a sensitive, artistic eye and methods of representing nature that pre-date [[Modern Art]].  They seek to create paintings that are personal, expressive, beautiful, and skillful.  Their subject matter includes all of the traditional categories within Western Art: [[figurative art|figurative]], landscape, portraiture, indoor and outdoor genre and [[still life]] paintings.

A central idea of Classical Realism is the belief that the [[Modern Art]] movements of the 20th century opposed the tenets and production of traditional art and caused a general loss of the skills and methods needed to produce it. Modernism was antagonistic to art as it was conceived by the Greeks, resurrected in the [[Renaissance]], and carried on by the academies of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.&lt;ref name="P1"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Panero|first=James|title=The New Old School|work=[[The New Criterion]]|volume=25|date=September 2006|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Classical Realist artists attempt to revive the idea of art production as it was traditionally understood: mastery of a craft in order to make objects that gratify and ennoble those who see them.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, Roger:  "Why the Art World Is a Disaster", ''The New Criterion'', Volume 25, June 2007, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This craftsmanship is then applied to drawing, painting or sculpting contemporary subjects which the artist observes in the modern world.

Like the 19th-century academic models from which it derives inspiration, the movement has drawn criticism for the premium placed upon technical performance, a tendency toward contrived and idealized depictions of the figure, and rhetorical overstatement when applied to epic narrative.&lt;ref name="P1"/&gt; Maureen Mullarkey of the ''[[New York Sun]]'' referred to the school as "a contemporary style with retro appeal—like Chrysler's PT Cruiser".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/nothing-left-to-hide/41413/|author=Maureen Mullarkey|title=Nothing Left To Hide|work=[[New York Sun]]|date=October 12, 2006|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools==

The Classical Realist movement is currently sustained through art schools based on the [[Atelier Method]]. Many present-day academies and ateliers follow the [[Charles Bargue]] drawing course. Richard Lack is generally regarded as the founder of the contemporary atelier movement. His school, Atelier Lack, was founded in 1969 and became a model for similar schools.&lt;ref name="atelier"&gt;Aristedes, Juliette.  ''Classical Drawing Atelier: A Contemporary Guide to Traditional Studio Practice'', Watson-Guptill Publications: 2006.  {{ISBN|0-8230-0657-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These modern ateliers are founded with the goal of revitalizing art education by reintroducing rigorous training in traditional drawing and painting techniques, employing teaching methodologies that were used in the [[École des Beaux-Arts]]. These schools pass on a method of instruction which melds formal [[academic art]] training with the influence of the French [[Impressionists]].

Under the atelier model, art students study in the studio of an established master to learn how to [[drawing|draw]] and [[paint]] with realistic accuracy and an emphasis on rendering form convincingly. The foundation of these programs rests on an intensive study of the human figure, renderings of plaster casts of [[classical sculpture]], and the emulation of their instructors. The goal is to make students adept at observation, theory, and craft while absorbing classical ideals of beauty.&lt;ref name="atelier"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2312">The '''Deligrad Event''' ({{lang-sr|Делиградски догађај}}) was an attempt to elevate the [[Principality of Serbia]] to a kingdom during the [[Serbian–Ottoman War (1876–78)]]. When the [[Great Powers]] agreed on ten days of ceasefire (3–13 September 1876), Russian general and Commander of the Serbian Army [[Mikhail Chernyayev]], who opposed peace with the Ottomans, went on 4 September to General [[Kosta Protić]] and asked him to declare the proclamation of a kingdom to the Army. The Army immediately swore [[Oath]] to "King Milan". The Great Powers opposed, and Prince Milan informed Chernyayev that he could not accept the declaration; Chernyayev replied that he was to leave with all Russian military if it was not accepted. Chernyayev assured that the recognition by the Great Powers was unnecessary, that the proclamation of kingdom raises the morale of the army and Serbian people, because "a kingdom means independence". It was compensation for the victims and the main profit of the war, which in his view, should continue after the truce for two months. He claimed that during that time, Russia would provide greater assistance to Serbia than even necessary. Prince Milan, pressured by the Great Powers, stated that he would not accept the proclamation. Chernyayev gave up on his threats, however, in order to save his reputation, the Prince's decision was not informed to the Morava–Timok Army. On 16 September a Serbian offensive began and failed, after which Chernyayev left Serbia and the Great Powers took on the initiative in Constantinople to suspend the war.

==Population==
According to the 2016 population census the population of Iran was 79.9 million,&lt;ref name="Iran Census Results 2016"/&gt; a fourfold increase since 1956. Between 1976 and 1986, an average annual population growth of almost 4% was reached, but due to decreasing fertility levels the growth decreased to 1.2% between 2011 and 2016.

The largest linguistic group comprises speakers of Iranian languages, like modern [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Gilaki language|Gilaki]], [[Mazanderani language|Mazandarani]], [[Luri]], [[Talysh language|Talysh]], and [[Balochi language|Balochi]]. Speakers of [[Turkic languages]], most notably [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]], which is by far the second-most spoken language in the country, but also the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], and the [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]] peoples, comprise a substantial minority. The remainder are primarily speakers of [[Semitic languages]] such as [[Arabs of Khuzestan|Arabic]] and [[Assyrians in Iran|Assyrian]]. There are small groups using other Indo-European languages such as [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]]; [[Georgian language|Georgian]] (a member of the [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]] language family), spoken in a large pocket only by those [[Iranian Georgians]] that live in [[Fereydan]], [[Fereydunshahr]]. Most of those Georgians who live in the north Iranian provinces of [[Gilan]], [[Mazandaran]], [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], [[Tehran Province]] and the rest of Iran no longer speak the language but keep a Georgian conscience.
The [[Circassians in Iran]], a very large minority in the past and speakers of the [[Circassian language]], have been strongly assimilated and absorbed within the population in the past few centuries. However, significant pockets do exist spread over the country, and they are the second-largest [[Caucasus]]-derived group in the nation after the Georgians.&lt;ref name="FdyRswC p 141"&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=stl97FdyRswC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=number+of+circassians+in+iran&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u_SmExfuC8&amp;sig=2lK8k9IsUQZyjCtdKqIAIr6Rc5M&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBDgKahUKEwins7Whz4vGAhVRCNsKHb9pAME#v=onepage&amp;q=number%20of%20circassians%20in%20iran&amp;f=false ''Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East''] Facts On File, Incorporated {{ISBN|143812676X}} p 141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/118238/Circassian|title=Circassian (people)|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews have had a continuous presence in Iran since the time of Cyrus the Great of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. In 1948, there were approximately 140,000–150,000 Jews living in Iran. According to the Tehran Jewish Committee, the Jewish population of Iran was (more recently) estimated at about 25,000 to 35,000, of which approximately 15,000 are in Tehran with the rest residing in Hamadan, Shiraz, Isfahan, Kermanshah, Yazd, Kerman, Rafsanjan, Borujerd, Sanandaj, Tabriz and Urmia. However, the official 2011 state census recorded only 8,756 Jews in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/jewish-woman-brutally-murdered-in-iran-over-property-dispute/#ixzz3Ac6duaqw |title=Jewish woman brutally murdered in Iran over property dispute|publisher=The Times of Israel |date= November 28, 2012 |access-date=Aug 16, 2014|quote="A government census published earlier this year indicated there were a mere 8,756 Jews left in Iran"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refugee population==
{{See also|Foreign relations of Iran}}
Iran hosts one of the largest [[refugee]] population in the world, with more than one million refugees, mostly from [[Afghan refugees|Afghanistan]] (80%) and [[Iraq]] (10%). Since 2006, Iranian officials have been working with the [[UNHCR]] and Afghan officials for their [[repatriation]].&lt;ref name="bbcb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/news/NEWS/452b78394.html |title=Tripartite meeting on returns to Afghanistan |first=[[UNHCR]] |last=United Nations |accessdate=2006-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=424#top |title=Migration Information Source - Iran: A Vast Diaspora Abroad and Millions of Refugees at Home |publisher=Migrationinformation.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1979 and 1997, UNHCR spent more than US$1 billion on Afghan refugees in Pakistan but only $150 million on those in Iran. In 1999, the [[Iranian government]] estimated the cost of maintaining its refugee population at US$10 million per day, compared with the US$18 million UNHCR allocated for all of its operations in Iran in 1999.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; As of 2016, some 300,000 [[work permit]]s have been issued for foreign nationals in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://financialtribune.com/articles/economy-domestic-economy/56277/300k-foreigners-have-work-permits|title=300K Foreigners Have Work Permits|date=26 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mitochondrial DNA ===
Mitochondrial DNA [[mtDNA]] represents the female lineage. The Iranian mitochondrial DNA shows more Western Eurasian lineages than the [[Y-DNA]] lineages.&lt;ref&gt;Kivisild et al. 2004, Nasidze et al. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, a West Eurasian MtDNA makes up over 90% of the Iranian population on average. (2013).&lt;ref name="plosone.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0080673|title=Complete Mitochondrial DNA Diversity in Iranians|author1= Miroslava Derenko |author2=Boris Malyarchuk|author3=Ardeshir Bahmanimehr|author4=Galina Denisova|author5=Maria Perkova|author6=Shirin Farjadian|author7=Levon Yepiskoposyan|date=November 2013|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among them, U3b3 lineages appear to be restricted to populations of Iran and the [[Caucasus]], while the sub-cluster U3b1a is common in the whole [[Near East]] region.&lt;ref name="plosone.org"/&gt;

In Iran outliers in the Y-chromosomes and Mitochondrial DNA gene pool are consisted by the north Iranian ethnicities, such as the [[Gilaki people|Gilaki's]] and [[Mazandarani people|Mazandarani's]], who's genetic build up including chromosomal DNA are nearly identical to the major [[South Caucasus|South Caucasian]] ethnicites, namely the [[Georgians]], [[Armenians]] and [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani's]]. Other outliers are made by the [[Baloch people]], representing a mere 1-2% of the total Iranian population, who have more patrilinial and mitochondrial DNA lines leaning towards northwest South Asian ethnic groups.

Levels of genetic variation in Iranian populations are comparable to the other groups from the [[Caucasus]], [[Anatolia]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="plosone.org"/&gt;

Tats are mainly [[Shia]] Muslims, with a significant [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]] minority.

===Parsis===
{{Main article|Parsis}}

The Parsis are the close-knit [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] community based primarily in [[India]] but also found in [[Pakistan]]. Parsis are descended from [[Persian Empire|Persian]] Zoroastrians who emigrated to the Indian subcontinent over 1,000 years ago. [[Census#India|Indian census]] data (2001) records 69,601 Parsis in India, with a concentration in and around the city of [[Mumbai]] (previously known as Bombay). There are approximately 8,000 Parsis elsewhere on the subcontinent, with an estimated 2,500 Parsis in the city of [[Karachi]] and approximately 50 Parsi families in Sri Lanka. The number of Parsis worldwide is estimated to be fewer than 100,000 (Eliade, 1991:254).

===Iranis===
{{Main article|Iranian peoples}}

In Pakistan and India, the term "Irani" has come to denote [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]]s who have migrated to Pakistan and India within the last two centuries, as opposed to most [[Parsis]] who arrived in India over 1000 years ago. Many of them moved during the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] era, when persecution of Iranian Zoroastrians was rampant. They are culturally and linguistically closer to the [[Zoroastrians in Iran|Zoroastrians of Iran]]. Unlike the [[Parsis]], they speak a [[Dari (Zoroastrian)|Dari]] dialect, the language spoken by the Iranian Zoroastrians in [[Yazd]] and [[Kerman]]. Their last names often resemble modern Iranian names, however Irani is a common surname among them. In India they are mostly located in modern-day [[Mumbai]] while in Pakistan they are mostly located in modern-day [[Karachi]]. In both Pakistan and India, they are famous for their restaurants and tea-houses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranian.ws/cgi-bin/iran_news/exec/view.cgi/5/12134&lt;/ref&gt; Some, such as [[Ardeshir Irani]], have also become very famous in cinema.

===Ajam (Bahrain)===
{{Main article|Ajam (Bahrain)}}
The "Ajam" are an ethnic community of Bahrain, of Iranian origin. They have traditionally been merchants living in specific quarters of [[Manama]] and [[Muharraq]]. The Iranians who adhere to [[Shiite]] sect of Islam are [[Ajam]], and they are different from the [[Huwala]]. Ajams are also a large percentage of the populace in UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman.

In addition to this, many names of ancient villages in Bahrain are of Persian origin. It is believed that these names were given during the [[Safavid]] rule of Bahrain (1501–1722). i.e. Karbabad, Salmabad, Karzakan, Duraz, Barbar, which indicates that the history of Ajams is much older.

===Huwala===
{{Main article|Huwala}}
Huwala are the descendants of [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Persian Arab]]s who belong to the [[Sunni]] sect of [[Islam]].&lt;ref name=mig&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/10443/730/1/Taqi10.pdf |title=Two ethnicities, three generations: Phonological variation and change in Kuwait |work=[[Newcastle University]] |year=2010 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huwala migrated from [[Ahvaz]] in Iran to the [[Persian Gulf]] in the seventeenth and eighteenth century.&lt;ref name=mig /&gt;&lt;ref name="roxane"&gt;{{cite book | last = Farmanfarmaian | first = Roxane | authorlink = |coauthors = | title = War and Peace in Qajar Persia | publisher = Routledge | year = 2008 | location = | pages = 128 | url = | doi =| id = |isbn = 978-0415421195 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Urdu]], the national and first official language of the country, is predominantly spoken within the city due to the ethnic mix of populations. English, the second official language, is also commonly understood. Other languages include [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Pashto language|Pashto]]. The [[mother tongue]] of the majority of the population is Punjabi, at 62%. 12% of the population are Sindhi speakers, 18% are Pashto speakers, and 8% other languages as of 2006 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=POPULATION BY MOTHER TONGUE|author=Population Census Organization, Govt. of Pakistan|url=http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/statistics/other_tables/pop_by_mother_tongue.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217220529/http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/statistics/other_tables/pop_by_mother_tongue.pdf|archivedate=2006-02-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The total migrant population of the city is 397,731, with the majority from Punjab (201,977). Around 116,614 of the migrated population came from [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], 75,143 from [[Sindh]], 24,438 from [[Azad Kashmir]], and 21,372 from other countries. Smaller populations emigrated from [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]], [[Baluchistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], and [[Gilgit-Baltistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MIGRANT POPULATION BY PLACE OF BIRTH |author=Population Census Organization, Govt. of Pakistan |url=http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/statistics/other_tables/migrant.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113175441/http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/statistics/other_tables/migrant.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam is the largest religion in the city, with 91.53% of the population Muslim. Per 1998 census in rural areas this percentage is 98.80%, while in urban areas the percentage of Muslims is 89.83%. The second largest religion is Christianity, with 6.07% of the population, 0.94% in rural areas and 5.70% in the city.

'''Eastside Spirit and Pride (ESSP)''' is a club in [[East Los Angeles College]], founded by [[Dennis Sanchez]]. The club has been involved in East Los Angeles College, and it has also made contributions to the school as well as the surrounding community.

==Mission of the Organization==
The mission of ESSP is to assist students of [[East Los Angeles College]] to  realize their potential in successfully transferring to four year universities. ESSP raises funds to create scholarship for students.  In addition ESSP  has established an irrevocable sense of pride in the school and in the greater community, focusing on [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]]. In addition, ESSP seeks to instill a strong sense of self-esteem in students who have had to overcome great obstacles  to attend college.

==History of the Club and Its Contributions to East Los Angeles College==
Professor [[Dennis Sanchez]], an alumnus of the [[University of Southern California]] and [[San Francisco State University]] found his occupational satisfaction in coming to East Los Angeles College and serving as an English professor because he wanted to give back to the community. He felt that students in ELAC were equally diligent as students at other community colleges, yet they were compelled by their circumstances to overcome much more adversity and sorrows. Therefore, he established East Side Spirit and Pride so that students of the college could develop a veracious sense of pride in their community and heritage.

East Side Spirit and Pride was a major advocate for the restoration [[football team]] at ELAC when football had been eliminated due to budgetary constraints.

Professor Sanchez along with the East Side Spirit and Pride members instigated the idea of the creation of a [[marching band]],
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could help pervade a sense of high-spirits and joy regarding East Los Angeles College. ESSP collaborated with the President of the college, Ernest Moreno, for the achievement of this objective, making ELAC, one of only three colleges in the entire state of [[California]] with a marching band during the time. To this day, the marching band has played an integral role in the atmosphere of the college and regularly performs during special occasions, such as football games and the annual commencement ceremony.

==East Side Spirit and Pride Today==
Today, East Side Spirit and Pride involves dozens of students, faculty, and staff every semester.  In addition, ESSP has a board of directors of nineteen members most of whom are former ESSP members as well as graduates of East Los Angeles College. The club holds regular meetings on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. ESSP also regularly features motivational speakers, generally former students of East Los Angeles College who have now graduated from four year universities and sometimes local celebrities, including Chase Masterson, actress,  [[Luis J. Rodriguez]], a [[Mexican-American]] native of [[East Los Angeles (region)|East Los Angeles]] and famous author of the book ''[[Always Running: La Vida Loca, Gang Days in L.A.]]'', and congresswoman [[Judy Chu]] both honored at ESSP's annual scholarship dinner.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The club also routinely hosts tours to various neighboring universities, such as [[Cal State Dominguez Hills]], [[Cal State Fullerton]], [[Cal State Los Angeles]], [[UCLA]], [[University of Southern California|USC]], [[Occidental College|Occidental]] and [[Loyola Marymount University]], where students have the opportunity to frequent campus grounds and explore possible options for their higher education.

East Side Spirit and Pride also has weekly readings, known as ''Great Moments in Literature'', where professors and students read and openly discuss and analyze the meanings of various literary works, many by renowned authors and poets such as [[Robert Frost]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[William Shakespeare]], and [[E. A. Robinson]].

The club also has interactive and informative discussions concerning procedures and important things-to-know relating to transferring to four-year universities in [[California]], primarily the [[UCs]], [[CSUs]], and [[private universities]] such as [[University of Southern California|USC]].
The club consists of over fifty members, a board of directors of nineteen members, an associate board, a faculty/staff committee as well as chapters of trustees throughout Southern California.  The club has welcomed UCLA graduate and English professor Nancy Ramirez as co-sponsor of the club.  Also joining ESSP are parents and players from West Hills Baseball, CA, who have partnered to help with the ESSP scholarship dinner and golf tournament to help raise funds for ELAC students.

On March 15, 2014, a fundraising event will be sponsored by East Side Spirit and Pride, featuring special guest, [[Edward James Olmos]], alumni of [[East Los Angeles College]] and Academy Award nominee for his role in ''[[Stand and Deliver]]''.

==Partnership with Homeboy Industries==
[[File:East Side Spirit and Pride Organization.jpg|thumb|right|405px|The East Side Spirit and Pride Organization together with representatives of [[Homeboy Industries]] outside of the Los Angeles [[Dodger Stadium]]]]
In 2010, East Side Spirit and Pride partnered up with [[Father Greg Boyle]] and [[Homeboy Industries]] in an attempt to reach out to the surrounding community. Professor Dennis Sanchez teaches a class called Bridge to College at Homeboy Industries on a routine basis in addition to having ESSP members tutor members of Homeboy Industry.  In addition he takes members from Homeboy Industries on tours to East Los Angeles College and other colleges in the Los Angeles area. As a result, many students from Homeboy Industry have enrolled at East Los Angeles College and other community colleges in the greater Los Angeles area.  Proceeds from the ESSP Annual Scholarship Dinner and its lunch and golf tournament go to fund educational scholarships and grants for members of Homeboy Industries and other at-risk members of the community.

'''Environmentalism''' has occasionally been a topic '''in music''', primarily since the 1940s. However, the earliest songs including environmentalist topics can be traced back to the 19th century, earliest of which is "Woodman! Spare that Tree!" by [[George Pope Morris]] and [[Henry Russell (musician)|Henry Russell]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1395159/Environmental_Activism_in_Music|title=Environmental Activism in Music|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ecomusicology |Ecomusicologists]] (musicologists and ethnomusicologists focusing on music and environmental issues) and music educators are increasingly emphasizing the intersections of music and nature, and musicking for ecological activism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcat.org/title/eco-literate-music-pedagogy/oclc/975386833&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcat.org/title/current-directions-in-ecomusicology-music-culture-nature/oclc/1001724999&lt;/ref&gt;

This topic was significantly more relevant in music in the '40s after World War II and has continually progressed over time. There are many artists across the world that advocate environmentalism such as the [[Barenaked Ladies]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Cloud Cult]], [[Dave Matthews Band]], [[Don Henley]], [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]], [[Green Day]], [[Guster]], [[Jack Johnson (musician)|Jack Johnson]], [[KT Tunstall]], [[Metallica]], [[Moby]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Perry Farrell]], [[Phish]]. [[The Roots]], [[Sarah Harmer]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Thom Yorke]], [[Willie Nelson]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Grist Staff, "22 Jun 2007 15 Green Musicians and Bands."Grist, June 27, 2007. http://grist.org/article/musicians/ (accessed November 21, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coscarelli, .

In addition to being a topic of music, Environmentalism has been increasingly prevalent among artists and the music industry itself. An example is the push for CDs to be packaged in [[Paperboard|cardboard]] rather than [[plastic]]. Also, many music festivals such as [[Bonnaroo]] make significant efforts to be sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnaroo, "Greening and Green Activism." Last modified 2012.

==Popular music from the 1960s-2000s==
{{further|List of songs about the environment}}

In the 1960s and 1970s a growing amount of popular music inspired by the [[counterculture]] movement reflected anti-war sentiments of peace and harmony. "[[Big Yellow Taxi]]" by [[Joni Mitchell]] was a song about environmental degradation with lyrics such as "They paved Paradise, put up a parking lot". Her reference to [[DDT]] in the song is a reflection of the times as [[Rachel Carson]]'s 1962 book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' had brought the dangers of DDT into the spotlight. [[John Denver]], a country and folk singer often sang about the wilderness of [[Colorado]] with popular songs such as "[[Rocky Mountain High]]" and "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]".

Black Sabbath's song "War Pigs" is an anti-war song that was extremely influential to young Americans across the nation.  Many consider the wave of environmentalism in the era to be the foundation of metal music in the world.  A song titled "Blackened" by Metallica is another song that supports environmentalism as is said in the lyrics "Blackened is the end, winter it will send, throwing all you see, into obscurity."  This song says that if war and rampage continue, the earth around us will die.  Environmentalism is still prevalent today as it continues to shape our way of life and forms of music.

In 1995 singer [[Michael Jackson]] came out with the hit "[[Earth Song]]" which was about environmental and animal welfare.  The production of the music video had an environmental theme, showing images of animal cruelty, deforestation, pollution, poverty and war. Jackson and the world's people unite in a spiritual chant—"Earth Song"—which summons a force that heals the world. Using special effects, time is reversed so that life returns, war ends, and the forests regrow. The video closes with a request for donations to Jackson's [[Heal the World Foundation]].&lt;ref name = "george 48-50"&gt;George, p. 48–50 {{clarify|reason=more information needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="''HIStory'' on Film volume II"&gt;Michael Jackson ''HIStory'' on Film volume II VHS/DVD&lt;/ref&gt; The clip was shown infrequently in the United States.&lt;ref name="HIStory Volume 2 dvd"&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=michael jackson|chart=all}} |title=History on Film, Vol. 2 |work=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |accessdate=September 15, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506130502/{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=michael jackson|chart=all}} |archivedate=May 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a massive concert entitled [[Live Earth (2007 concert)]] was held across the world to raise awareness and provoke action on climate change. Smaller concerts with similar themes have also been held around the world. An example is the Earth Music Festival which was held in [[Australia]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Earth Music Festival, Last modified 2009. Accessed November 26, 2012. http://www.earthmusicfestival.com/.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 [[Disney]] created a campaign called [[Disney's Friends for Change]] which helped to promote an environmental message. A song called [[Send It On (Disney's Friends for Change song)|Send it On]] recorded by Disney singers [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Demi Lovato]], the [[Jonas Brothers]] and [[Selena Gomez]] was produced and the profits donated to environmental charity organizations. The song debuted at number nine on Billboard's [[Hot Digital Songs]] which led to it making into the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], issue dated August 29, 2009.&lt;ref name="digital"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2009-08-29/digital-songs|title=Digital Songs|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media, Inc]]|date=August 29, 2009|accessdate=August 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Send It On" debuted and peaked at number twenty in the Hot 100.&lt;ref name="billboard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2009-08-29/hot-100?begin=11&amp;order=position|title=Top 100 Music Hits, Top 100 Music Charts, Top 100 Songs &amp; The Top 100|date=August 29, 2009|accessdate=August 20, 2009|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="acharts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acharts.us/song/48868|title=Disney's Friends For Change - Send It On - Music Charts|publisher=aCharts.us|accessdate=August 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then fell to number twenty-one, and stayed on for three more weeks before falling off.&lt;ref name="billboard2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2009-09-05/hot-100?begin=21&amp;order=position|title=Top 100 Music Hits, Top 100 Music Charts, Top 100 Songs &amp; The Top 100|accessdate=August 27, 2009|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rock club in New York City called [[Wetlands Preserve]] served as both a performance venue and a hub for environmentalist activism from 1989-2001.&lt;ref&gt;McKinley Jr., James C. "Larry Bloch, Who Built the Wetlands Club, Dies at 59." ''New York Times'', sec. Region, Nov 03, 2012. https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/nyregion/larry-bloch-who-opened-wetlands-club-dies-at-59.html (accessed November 23, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NYRock, "NYC's Legendary Wetlands Preserve Rock Club Forced to Close Its Doors After Almost 13 Years."

==Music since World War II==

After a radioactive isotope ([[Strontium-90]]) was found in cows milk in 1959, the concern for the environmental effects of the [[nuclear arms race]] increased exponentially. This sparked songs about the invisibility of environmental effects like radioactive isotopes. In his song "Mack the Bomb," [[Pete Seeger]] wrote a comparison between a shark and Strontium-90, explaining that the threat of a shark is at least visible, unlike radioactive isotopes. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ingram|first=David|title=“My Dirty Stream”: Pete Seeger, American Folk Music, and Environmental Protest|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03007760601061456?needAccess=true|journal=Popular Music and Society|volume=31|issue=1|pages=21–36|doi=10.1080/03007760601061456}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, [[Malvina Reynolds]] also wrote a song called "[[What Have They Done to the Rain|What Have They Done to the Rain?]]", which was inspired by above-ground nuclear testing, and how it was putting Strontium-90 into the air, then into soil through rain, which is how it got into cows and their milk. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/MALVINA/mr183.htm|title=Song lyrics to What Have They Done to the Rain?, by Malvina Reynolds|website=people.wku.edu|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Pete Seeger]] released what is considered the first environmentalist album, entitled "[[God Bless the Grass]]" in 1966. The 1960s produced a large amount of environmental-focused songs, primarily due to the popularization of folk music and the musicians that penned many environmental protest songs, in that genre. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1395159/Environmental_Activism_in_Music|title=Environmental Activism in Music|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern classical music ==
While composers have often used nature as their inspiration, the period since [[World War II]] has seen an ever increasing amount of music in this regard. Composers such as [[John Cage]] and [[Olivier Messiaen]] began using patterns in nature as their materials in [[Musical Composition]].&lt;ref&gt;David Ingram, ""The clutter of the unkempt forest": John Cage, Music and American Environmental Thought," Amerikastudien / American Studies, 51, no. 4 (2006): 567-579, {{jstor|41158263}} (accessed November 20, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;KOZINN, Allan.

(accessed November 20, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; One example of Cage's use of environmental sounds is the piece Child of Tree. This work involves amplifying a cactus and pea pod shakers in addition to other instruments chosen by the performer.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Samuel. SZSolomon.com, "John Cage, Child of Tree (1975)." Accessed November 26, 2012. http://szsolomon.com/notes/cagetree.shtml.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[John Luther Adams]] writes music directly from his surroundings in [[Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;Gutierrez, . United States Artists, "USA Fellows Stories: John Luther Adams." Last modified 2006. Accessed November 23, 2012. http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/news/usa/usa_fellows_stories_john_luther_adams&lt;/ref&gt; He is an [[environmentalist]] who has written and discussed the role that artists can play in combating [[Global Warming]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams,. John Luther Adams, "Global Warming and Art." Last modified 2000. Accessed November 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of his music is the piece ''The Place Where You Go to Listen''. This work involves a sound and light installation that is "controlled by natural events occurring in real time."&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Alex. "Song of the Earth: A composer takes inspiration from the Arctic." The New Yorker, May 12, 2008.  http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/05/12/080512fa_fact_ross (accessed November 25, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Baltic Sea Festival]] was founded on the theme of preserving the environment. Countries surrounding the [[Baltic Sea]] are brought together to solve problems with the body of water. Music "serves as a good platform" in discussions of solutions which can only be solved jointly.&lt;ref&gt;Jönsson, Ann-Charlotte. "Classical music and environment at Baltic Sea Festival."

'''Fatted calf''' is a metaphor or symbol of festive celebration and rejoicing for someone's long-awaited return. It derives from the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]] in the [[New Testament]].  In biblical times, people would often keep at least one piece of livestock that was fed a special diet to fatten it up, thus making it more flavorsome when prepared as a meal.  Slaughtering this livestock was to be done on rare and special occasions.  Thus when the prodigal son returns, the father "kills the fatted calf" to show that the celebration is out of the ordinary.

In modern usage, "killing the fatted calf" can simply mean to celebrate in an exuberant manner, as used in the [[Elton John]] song "[[Bennie and the Jets]]".

{{nihongo|'''''Final Fantasy X-2'''''|ファイナルファンタジーX-2|Fainaru Fantajī Ten Tsū}} is a [[role-playing video game]] developed and published by [[Square (company)|Square]] for the [[PlayStation 2]], as the direct sequel to ''[[Final Fantasy X]]''. The game's story follows the character [[Yuna (Final Fantasy)|Yuna]] from ''Final Fantasy X'' as she seeks to resolve political conflicts in the [[fictional universe|fictional world]] of [[Spira (Final Fantasy)|Spira]] before they lead to war and to search for her lost love Tidus from ''Final Fantasy X''.

''Final Fantasy X-2'' set several precedents in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series aside from being the first direct sequel in video game form and the second sequel in the franchise, after the [[anime]] ''[[Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals]]''. It was the first game in the series to feature only three [[player character]]s, an all-female main cast, and early access to most of the game's locations. Additionally, it featured a variation of the [[Final Fantasy character classes|character classes]] system—one of the series' classic gameplay concepts—and is one of the few games in the series to feature multiple endings. Finally, it was the first game in the series that did not have musical contributions in it from longtime composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]].

The game was positively received by critics and was commercially successful. It sold 1.92 million copies in North America, and 5.29 million copies worldwide. ''Final Fantasy X-2'' was voted as the 32nd best game of all time by the readers of ''[[Famitsu]]''. The English version of the game won an award for "Outstanding Achievement in Character Performance" at the [[Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences]] in 2004. The game has attained a rating of 86% on [[GameRankings]] and an 85% rating on [[Metacritic]]. It was the final ''Final Fantasy'' game to be developed by Square before merging with Enix in April 2003. The game was re-released as a high-definition remaster for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Vita]] in 2013, together with ''Final Fantasy X'', under the title ''[[Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster]]''. It was also re-released for the [[PlayStation 4]] in May 2015&lt;ref name="PS4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/11/final-fantasy-x-x-2-hd-remaster-coming-to-ps4|title=Yes, Final Fantasy X / X-2 HD coming to PlayStation 4, |author=Luke Karmali|publisher=IGN.com|date=11 December 2014|accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Microsoft Windows]] in May 2016, and will be released on the [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[Xbox One]] in 2019. [[Square Enix]] announced in 2013 that the ''Final Fantasy X'' series has sold over 14 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name=Dec2013Sales&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jp.square-enix.com/company/ja/news/2013/html/cea4547d66edba7a424ff516c8715511.html |title=Final Fantasy X sales in October 2013 |publisher=[[Square Enix Japan]] |date=October 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==

Though a direct sequel to ''Final Fantasy X'', ''Final Fantasy X-2'' does not duplicate its predecessor's gameplay; instead, it innovates on traditional elements. Like pre-''Final Fantasy X'' installments, characters "level up" after a certain number of battles, by gaining pre-determined [[Attribute (role-playing games)|stat]] bonuses. The [[Conditional Turn-Based Battle|conditional turn-based battle]] system in ''Final Fantasy X'' has been replaced by a faster-paced variation of the ''Final Fantasy'' series' traditional active time battle (ATB) system, which was originally designed by [[Hiroyuki Ito]] and first featured in ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''. Whenever a random enemy is encountered, the ATB system is used. Under this enhanced version of the ATB, playable characters may interrupt an enemy while they are preparing to take action, instead of waiting for an enemy's turn to finish before attacking. Furthermore, it is possible for both characters and enemies to chain attacks together for greater damage.

=== Navigation and quests ===

Another departure from the gameplay of ''Final Fantasy X'' is in its world navigation system: players can visit almost every location in Spira from early in the game,&lt;ref name="gamespot"&gt;{{cite web | last=Shoemaker|first=Brad | year=2003 | title=Final Fantasy X-2 for PlayStation 2 Review | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/finalfantasyx2/review.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031204085535/http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/finalfantasyx2/review.html | archivedate=2003-12-04 | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate=2006-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; transported via the [[airship]] Celsius. This is a deviation from the overall ''Final Fantasy'' series, where the most efficient means of transportation is typically not obtained until late in the game.

[[File:FFX-2navigationexample.jpg|thumb|left|An example of navigation on the field map]]

These two changes allow players to choose a less linear storyline. Unlike ''Final Fantasy X'', in which a player's course through the game's world was largely straightforward, ''Final Fantasy X-2'' is almost entirely free form. The game consists of five chapters, with each location featuring one scenario per chapter. Put together, the five scenarios in one locale form a subplot of the game, called an "Episode". Only a few scenarios per chapter are integral to the game's central plot, and are marked on the world navigation system as "Hotspots" ("Active Links" in the Japanese version).&lt;ref name="gamespot" /&gt; By accessing only Hotspots, a player can quickly proceed through the game's story without participating in [[Quest (gaming)|sidequests]].

The game keeps track of the player's completed percentage of the storyline, increased by viewing the scenarios comprising each Episode. If 100% of the game is completed, an additional ending will be unlocked. The game features a fork in its plot, allowing the player to make a choice that changes what scenes they see and the number of percentage points they acquire afterward. It is impossible to see all of the game's content on a single playthrough, due to this fork in the storyline, although it is possible to achieve 100% storyline completion in a single playthrough. However, a 100% storyline completion can only be achieved through one of the two possible storylines. When the game is completed for the first time, it unlocks a [[New Game Plus]] option that allows the player to restart the game with all of the items, Garment Grids, dresspheres and storyline completion percentage achieved previously. However, all character levels are set back to one.

The field-map navigation system is largely unchanged from ''Final Fantasy X''; it is still dominantly [[3D computer graphics|three dimensional]] with mostly continuous locations. A few upgrades have been implemented, providing the player with extended interaction with the environment through jumping, climbing and rotating camera angles.

The game's sidequests include minor tasks and quests, optional [[boss (video games)|bosses]] and dungeons, and the most [[minigame]]s of any ''Final Fantasy'' at the time of its release.&lt;ref name="igndeveloperinterview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunham |first=Jeremy |year=2003 |title=Final Fantasy X-2 Developer Interview |url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/442/442025p1.html |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2006-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810062807/http://ps2.ign.com/articles/442/442025p1.html |archivedate=2012-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These minigames include Gunner's Gauntlet (a third-person/first-person [[shooter game]]) and [[Minigames of Final Fantasy#Sphere Break|Sphere Break]] (a [[Operation (mathematics)|mathematical]] coin game involving [[addition]] and [[multiplication]]), as well as the fictional underwater sport [[Minigames of Final Fantasy#Blitzball|blitzball]] originally featured in ''Final Fantasy X'' with a different control scheme. Director [[Motomu Toriyama]] has explained that one of the concepts at issue during development was providing a large variety of minigames, such that "if you bought ''Final Fantasy X-2'' you wouldn't need any other game".&lt;ref name="igndeveloperinterview" /&gt;

=== Dresspheres and the Garment Grid ===
{{details|Final Fantasy character jobs}}
[[File:FFX-2bossfight.JPG|thumb|A battle with an early boss, depicting the characters' default dresspheres]]
''Final Fantasy X-2'' reintroduces the series' classic character class system (seen previously in ''[[Final Fantasy III]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy V]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'') through the inclusion of dresspheres. Because the party never grows beyond three characters, switching characters during battle is unnecessary. Instead, the player can switch character classes, providing access to different abilities. The playable characters are allowed to equip one dressphere at a time, each providing different battle functions and abilities. Characters can learn new skills for each dressphere with the use of Ability Points (AP). AP is obtained by defeating enemies and by the use of items and abilities for that sphere. Abilities to be learned are chosen in the main menu. During battle, AP is given to that ability until it is learned. Each character can access as many as six dresspheres at a time, depending on the specific properties of the Garment Grid they are wearing. The Garment Grid is a placard featuring a geometric shape connected by nodes. These nodes are slots that can be filled with dresspheres, allowing characters to change character classes during their turn in battle. Most Garment Grids possess Gates that when passed through grant the user a complimentary [[buff (computer gaming)|buff]].

As with equipped items, Garment Grids often provide characters with a variety of enhancements and extra abilities. The game features diverse Garment Grids and dresspheres which can be discovered as the game progresses. While normal dresspheres can be used by all three playable characters, each character can acquire a dressphere that only they can use. These dresspheres can only be activated after a character has changed into all of the classes designated to her Garment Grid in a single battle. When a character activates one of these dresspheres, the other characters are replaced by two controllable support units.

=== Setting ===
Like the preceding game, ''Final Fantasy X-2'' is set in the fictional world of [[Spira (Final Fantasy)|Spira]], consisting of one large landmass divided into three subcontinents, surrounded by small tropical islands. It features diverse climates, ranging from the tropical Besaid and Kilika islands, to the temperate Mi'ihen region, to the frigid Macalania and Mt. Gagazet areas. Although predominantly populated by [[human]]s, Spira features a variety of races. Among them are the Al Bhed, a technologically advanced but previously disenfranchised sub-group of humans with distinctive green eyes and unique language.&lt;ref name="aftersalvage"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=December 20, 2001 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote= '''Rikku''': We're Al Bhed. Can't you tell? Wait, you're not an Al Bhed-hater, are you? / '''Tidus''': I don't even know what an Al Bhed ''is.'' / '''Rikku''': Where are you from? / '''Tidus''': Zanarkand. I'm a blitzball player. Star player of the Zanarkand Abes! / '''Rikku''': Did you...hit your head or something? / '''Tidus''': Um, ''you'' guys hit me. / '''Rikku''': Oh, right... Do you remember anything before that? / '''Tidus [voiceover]''': So I told her everything there was to tell about Zanarkand; about life there, blitzball, and Sin's attack...and about how Auron and I were engulfed in this light.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blame"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=December 20, 2001 |platform=PlayStation 2|level=Macalania |quote='''Wakka''': But you Al Bhed use the forbidden machina!

Still less human are the [[lion]]-like Ronso and the [[frog]]-like Hypello. A subset of Spira's sentient races are the "unsent", the strong-willed spirits of the dead that remain in corporeal form. In Spira, the dead who are not sent to the Farplane by a summoner come to envy the living and transform into "[[Four Fiends|fiends]]", the monsters that are encountered throughout the game;&lt;ref name="sending"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square EA |date=December 20, 2001 |platform=PlayStation 2|level=Kilika|quote='''Tidus''': What's a "sending"? Are we going somewhere? / '''Lulu''': You truly are clueless. Are you sure it's just your memory that's the problem? ... The dead need guidance. Filled with grief over their own death, they refuse to face their fate. They yearn to live on, and resent those still alive. You see, they envy the living. And in time, that envy turns to anger, even hate. Should these souls remain in Spira, they become fiends that prey on the living. Sad, isn't it? The sending takes them to the Farplane, where they may rest in peace.}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, unsent with strong attachments to the world of the living may retain their human form. While the setting of the original ''Final Fantasy X'' was decidedly somber, in ''Final Fantasy X-2'', the main characters were fitted with a jovial ''[[Charlie's Angels]]''-like motif. Whereas ''Final Fantasy X'' drew heavily on ancient Japanese culture and Asian settings,&lt;ref name="interviews"&gt;{{cite web | year=2001 | title=Behind The Game The Creators | url=http://www.square-enix-usa.com/games/FFX/btg/creators.html#1 | publisher=Square Enix North America | accessdate=2006-04-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410062859/http://www.square-enix-usa.com/games/FFX/btg/creators.html |archivedate=2009-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Final Fantasy X-2'' incorporated a number of elements from modern Japanese [[popular culture|pop culture]].&lt;ref name="igndeveloperinterview"/&gt;

Aesthetically, the world of Spira is essentially unchanged in the two years since ''Final Fantasy X'', and many locations return from the game. There are, however, major changes in the ideology of Spira's people. After Sin's defeat came the arrival of an era known as "the Eternal Calm". The priests of the Yevon religion chose to expose the truth about the order,&lt;ref name="truth"&gt;{{Cite book | year=2004 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy X-2: International+Last Mission Ultimania | page=583 | language=Japanese | publisher=DigiCube/Square Enix | isbn=4-7575-1163-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving the population to decide for themselves how to live in a world without that religion and without Sin. Advanced technology and the Al Bhed are now embraced by the population as a whole, which has begun to pursue leisures such as attending musical concerts and participating in the sport of [[Minigames of Final Fantasy#Blitzball|blitzball]]. Others have become hunters of ancient treasures, ranging from coins and machinery to [[Spira (Final Fantasy)#Spheres|spheres]] in forgotten caves and ruins. Those who pursue the latter are known as "sphere hunters", of which many groups have formed.

In the absence of Yevon, new groups have formed. Young people were especially quick to abandon Yevon and embrace machinery, while many of the older generation felt that cultural changes were happening too quickly. The most influential of the new groups are the progressive Youth League, led by Mevyn Nooj and seeking a break from the past, the New Yevon Party, led by a former priest named "Trema" until his disappearance and later by Praetor Baralai, which seeks more gradual change, and the neutral Machina League, led by Gippal. By the start of the game, there are rising tensions between the Youth League and New Yevon factions. Both groups have sought out High Summoner [[Yuna (Final Fantasy)|Yuna]]'s support, who has instead joined a sphere hunter group with her cousin in hopes of finding a way to bring back [[Tidus]], her lost love who vanished during the ending of ''Final Fantasy X''.&lt;ref name="rikkuadvice"&gt;'''Rikku:''' Well, look, I really want Yuna to go. / '''Wakka:''' She can't do that. / '''Rikku:''' Why not? / '''Wakka:''' Because she's booked solid for three months, ya!

Okay, maybe once things calm down, y'know? / '''Rikku:''' And what if they don't, Wakka? What then, huh? I don't believe it. After everything Yuna did for us! Why can't she just do what she wants to do now? Why? You know, every time I visited here, I wondered... why is it, that when everyone's out making their dreams happen and everyone's getting their chance, Yuna's dreams are on hold? / '''Wakka:''' Gee, it's not like... / '''Rikku:''' What do you know anyway, tubby? Yuna? / '''Yuna:''' I want... (I want to journey again. But... if I leave, I'll be disappointing everyone else.) I want... I'll go. Square Co.

=== Characters ===
{{main article|Characters of Final Fantasy X and X-2}}
The three main playable characters of ''Final Fantasy X-2'' are [[Yuna (Final Fantasy)|Yuna]], Rikku and Paine, whose team is abbreviated in-game as "YRP" ("YuRiPa" in the original Japanese version). Yuna and Rikku reprise their roles from ''Final Fantasy X'', and, though their personalities are much the same as before, Square decided that their appearances would be heavily altered to give a greater impression of activity. Furthermore, it was decided that the pervading cultural changes occurring in ''Final Fantasy X''{{'}}s world as they and others began trying to live positively would be reflected in the new clothing of these two characters. The character of Paine is a new creation designed for inclusion in ''Final Fantasy X-2'', to accommodate the game's intended [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] style revolving around a trio of female characters.&lt;ref name="igndeveloperinterview"/&gt; Her personality is far more cynical and emotionally distant than that of her teammates, and she keeps her past a secret from them for much of the game.

Several other major and supporting characters from ''Final Fantasy X'' appear in the game. Additionally, other new characters are introduced in ''Final Fantasy X-2'', such as the faction leaders and the Leblanc Syndicate, a group of sphere hunters who serve as the Gullwings' rivals for much of the game. The game's main antagonist is Shuyin, another new character.

=== Story ===
Two years after Sin's defeat, Yuna, Rikku and Paine recover Yuna's stolen Garment Grid from the Leblanc Syndicate in the first of several encounters in which they vie for spheres. The game is punctuated by a narration of Yuna addressing Tidus, as though she is recounting the events of the game to him as they occur.&lt;ref name="YunaToTidus"&gt;{{cite video game|title='''Final Fantasy X-2''' |developer=Square Co |publisher=[[Square Enix]] U.S.A. |date=2003-11-18 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]] |quote='''Yuna:''' It all began when I saw this sphere of you.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Gullwings discover an ancient sphere containing images of an enormous machina weapon called "Vegnagun" that was secretly buried beneath Bevelle. The weapon has enough power to threaten all of Spira,&lt;ref name="vegnagun"&gt;{{cite video game|title='''Final Fantasy X-2''' |developer=Square Co |publisher=[[Square Enix]] U.S.A. |date=2003-11-18 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]] |quote='''Nooj:''' Some advice: That...thing... The colossus you saw is known as Vegnagun. It possesses overwhelming destructive power. It must not be touched!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vegnagun2"&gt;{{cite video game|title='''Final Fantasy X-2''' |developer=Square Co |publisher=[[Square Enix]] U.S.A. |date=2003-11-18 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]] |quote='''Baralai:''' I know why you've come. You're here to destroy the weapon that threatens all of Spira: Vegnagun.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gullwings then join forces with the Leblanc Syndicate to investigate the underground areas of the city in an attempt to destroy the machine before it can be used by either side in the upcoming conflict. However, discovering a large tunnel recently dug into the floor of the weapon's chamber, they realize that Vegnagun has apparently moved to the Farplane, located at Spira's [[Planetary core|core]].

Disagreements between Spira's factions are soon punctuated further after the disappearance of Baralai, Nooj, and Gippal—the leaders of New Yevon, the Youth League and the Machine Faction respectively. Returning to the underground areas of Bevelle, the Gullwings discover the missing faction leaders discussing Vegnagun and learn that the machine's AI allows it to detect hostility and to respond by activating itself and fleeing.&lt;ref name="vegnagun4"&gt;{{cite video game|title='''Final Fantasy X-2''' |developer=Square Co |publisher=[[Square Enix]] U.S.A. |date=2003-11-18 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|quote='''Baralai''': The thing's more sensitive than its size would lead one to believe. It detects hostility, and in an instant, springs to life! Should one even think of harming it, it awakens like a frightened child.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player then learns that Paine had once been friends with all three men.&lt;ref name="paine"&gt;{{cite video game|title='''Final Fantasy X-2''' |developer=Square Co |publisher=[[Square Enix]] U.S.A. |date=2003-11-18 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]] |quote='''Paine:''' They're old friends.

Within the cave, the various squad candidates were swarmed by [[pyreflies]] and driven to kill one another. The only survivors were Paine, Baralai, Gippal, and Nooj. Soon after, Nooj was possessed by Shuyin shot his surviving comrades and left them to die, severing the friendship the group had with one another.&lt;ref name="despair"&gt;{{cite video game|title='''Final Fantasy X-2''' |developer=Square Co |publisher=[[Square Enix]] U.S.A. |date=2003-11-18 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|quote='''Paine:''' This is what destroyed the Squad.

Shuyin possesses Baralai's body, pursuing Vegnagun to the Farplane. Nooj and Gippal follow in pursuit, asking Yuna to keep things under control on the surface.&lt;ref name="aeons"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X-2|developer=Square Co |publisher=[[Square Enix]] U.S.A. |date=2003-11-18 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|quote='''Fayth:''' Yuna.

Shuyin expresses his anger that Spira's citizens have not yet come to understand the heartache that war can cause, and plans to use Vegnagun to destroy all of Spira.&lt;ref name="shuyin"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X-2 |developer=Square Co |publisher=[[Square Enix]] U.S.A. |date=2003-11-18 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|quote='''Shuyin:''' Lenne. We disappeared together, but when I awoke, I was alone. I looked for you for so long. While I wandered, I realized something: Spira hasn't really changed at all. Everyone's still fighting over nothing.  Still dying like they used to. A thousand years have passed, and they can't leave the hatred behind. I'm through waiting. I'll fix it. This world continues to fail us, and what's worse, I failed to protect you. Vegnagun will make that all go away. And we'll fade together again, together. Help me do it, Lenne.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The player learns that 1000 years before the game, Shuyin was a famous blitzball player in the high-tech metropolis of [[Locations in Spira#Geography|Zanarkand]], and the lover of a popular [[Final Fantasy character classes#Bard|songstress]] and [[Final Fantasy character classes#Summoner|summoner]]—Lenne.  Before he could use Vegnagun, Lenne begged him to stop. Shuyin yielded, but a group of Bevelle soldiers arrived a moment later and shot the couple.&lt;ref name="lenne2"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X-2 |developer=Square Co |publisher=[[Square Enix]] U.S.A. |date=2003-11-18 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|quote='''Paine:''' The man she loved, he struggled to save her.

The one person she wanted to tell...he never heard her words.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gullwings organize a concert to which everyone in Spira is invited, supporters of the Youth League and New Yevon alike. Additionally, the Songstress dressphere worn by Yuna is revealed to hold Lenne's memories, resulting in a sphere screen projecting them to everyone in attendance during the concert. Witnessing images of Shuyin and Lenne's last moments, Spira's citizens begin to understand the unproductive nature of their disagreements.&lt;ref name="lenne3"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy X-2 |developer=Square Co. |publisher=[[Square Enix]] U.S.A. |date=2003-11-18 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|quote='''Buddy:''' Lenne, huh? / '''Shinra:''' Yeah, the girl from the Songstress dressphere. ''[...]'' / '''Rikku:''' So, the reason Shuyin keeps calling Yuna "Lenne" is— / '''Paine:''' Because of that dressphere? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the factional fighting has ceased, Shuyin has nearly carried out his plan to destroy Spira with Vegnagun. Joining forces with the Leblanc Syndicate once again, the Gullwings make their way to the Farplane and find Gippal and Nooj already battling Vegnagun. Subsequently, the [[fayth]] once located in Bevelle appears before Yuna and thanks her as well. He then asks her if she would like to see "him" again. If the player replies with "Yes", and a sufficient percentage of the game's optional storyline has been completed, the fayth locates Tidus's scattered pyreflies and sends them to Besaid, where they reform; thus, when Yuna returns home, she is reunited with Tidus. Players who achieve 100% completion in addition to reviving Tidus will see an additional reunion scene in Zanarkand where the pair discuss whether he is truly real or still a dream.&lt;ref name="Reunion"&gt;{{cite video game|title='''Final Fantasy X-2''' |developer=Square Co |publisher=[[Square Enix]] U.S.A. |date=2003-11-18 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]] |quote='''Tidus:''' I got a theory.

And I'll cherish you. [...] / '''Yuna:''' Is that what the fayth told you? / '''Tidus:''' Nah, but I like it. [''Yuna playfully pushes Tidus into a pond''] '''Tidus:''' That's not cherishing! / '''Yuna:''' You didn't disappear.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Development of ''Final Fantasy X-2'' began in late 2001 in response to the success of ''Final Fantasy X'', particularly fan reaction to the ''Eternal Calm'' video included in the Japanese version of ''Final Fantasy X International''.&lt;ref name="igndeveloperinterview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="startdate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/26766/more-final-fantasy-x-2-details/|title=More Final Fantasy X-2 Details|last=Fox|first=Fennec|date=2002-10-23|publisher=[[GamePro]]|accessdate=2010-01-24|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607145223/http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/26766/more-final-fantasy-x-2-details/|archivedate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sequel"&gt;{{cite book | year=2001 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy X Ultimania Ω | page=191 | language=Japanese | publisher=DigiCube/Square Enix | isbn=4-88787-021-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in Japan shortly before the merger between [[Square Co.|Square]] and [[Enix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=IGN Staff | date=2002-11-29 | title=Square and Enix Meet the Press | publisher=IGN | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/378/378959p1.html | accessdate=2007-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's eventual name, ''X-2'', was initially not liked by the production team, but it was eventually accepted since the story was a direct continuation of ''X'' and thus could not be the next numbered title in the series.&lt;ref name="SilX2a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/03/18/square-enix-made-final-fantasy-x-2/|title=Why Square Enix Made Final Fantasy X-2|author=Spencer|publisher=Siliconera|date=2014-03-18|accessdate=2014-03-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329105331/http://www.siliconera.com/2014/03/18/square-enix-made-final-fantasy-x-2/|archivedate=2014-03-29|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kazushige Nojima]], the previous game's writer, was also skeptical about the creation of a sequel. Something he was particularly averse to originally was the happy ending, which he felt was wrong for the story.&lt;ref name="SilX2b"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/01/08/final-fantasy-x-writer-shares-thoughts-memories-series/|title=Final Fantasy X Writer Shares His Thoughts And Memories Of The Series|author=Sato|publisher=Siliconera|date=2014-01-08|accessdate=2014-03-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109183743/http://www.siliconera.com/2014/01/08/final-fantasy-x-writer-shares-thoughts-memories-series/|archivedate=2014-01-09|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production team was one third the size of the previous installment. This was because the team was already familiar with the material and it allowed them to give a hand-crafted feel to the game. In designing the game, a significant number of character models, enemies, and location designs from ''Final Fantasy X'' were reused. Character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]] has explained that this allowed the game to be developed in one year and at half the normal scope ''Final Fantasy'' titles are normally produced.&lt;ref name="models"&gt;{{cite web| author = GameSpot Staff| year= 2003| title = Square Enix considering Kingdom Hearts sequel| url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/finalfantasy7/news_6026421.html| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| accessdate = 2006-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maya (software)|Maya]] and [[Softimage]] 3D were the two main programs used to create the graphics.&lt;ref name="JapaneseGameGraphics"&gt;{{cite book| editor = ed. Rico Komanoya| title = Japanese Game Graphics: Behind the Scenes of Your Favorite Games| year = 2004| publisher = Harper Design International| location = [[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|NY]]| isbn = 0-06-056772-4| pages = 20–25| chapter = Final Fantasy X-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producer [[Yoshinori Kitase]] and director Motomu Toriyama have explained that the objective in mind when designing ''Final Fantasy X-2'' was to embrace the concept of change as the game's theme and establish a more upbeat atmosphere than its predecessor.&lt;ref name="igndeveloperinterview"/&gt; The reuse of the engine and locations from the original game meant that the team could spend most of their time focusing on the gameplay systems and plot.&lt;ref name="GRint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/exclusive-interview-final-fantasy-x-2/ |title=Exclusive interview: Final Fantasy X-2 |publisher=[[GamesRadar]] |date=2004-03-09 |accessdate=2016-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114122727/http://www.gamesradar.com/exclusive-interview-final-fantasy-x-2/ |archivedate=2013-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To portray the drastic change in Spira, the developers excluded summons, redesigned towns, and included vehicles. The low-flying vehicles were added to allow the player quicker access and mobility to the areas that were already available in the previous title.&lt;ref name="JapaneseGameGraphics"/&gt;

The ending of ''Final Fantasy X'' meant that the Aeon summoning system from the game could not be used in the sequel, necessitating the team to make a new gameplay system.&lt;ref name="GRint"/&gt; Because of the emphasis on a more optimistic setting, the game's dressphere system (inspired by the [[magical girl]] subgenre of [[anime]] and [[manga]]) was implemented, and the atmosphere of [[J-pop]] introduced right from the game's opening sequence. Additional allusions to popular culture in general were featured, such as the style of ''[[Charlie's Angels]].''&lt;ref name="igndeveloperinterview"/&gt; The dressphere system, along with having a lead cast of three non-"macho" girls were intended to keep the tone of the game light and lively. Lulu was excluded from the lead cast because, in addition to being married, her presence would have given her an "older sister" role to Yuna, rather than letting Yuna take the lead on discovering herself on her own.&lt;ref name="GRint"/&gt; Though work on the opening song and motion capture began early in development, the opening sequence was actually the last portion of the game to be completed.&lt;ref name="JapaneseGameGraphics"/&gt;

=== Music ===
{{main article|Music of Final Fantasy X-2}}
For ''Final Fantasy X-2'', regular series composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]] was replaced by [[Noriko Matsueda]] and [[Takahito Eguchi]] of ''[[The Bouncer (video game)|The Bouncer]]'' fame.&lt;ref name="igndeveloperinterview"/&gt; Among the game's more notable tracks are two vocalized songs: the J-pop-style "[[real Emotion/1000 no Kotoba|Real Emotion]]" and a more slowly-paced ballad, "[[Real Emotion/1000 no Kotoba|1000 Words]]". The Japanese versions of the songs are sung by [[Kumi Koda]], a Japanese music artist who also performed motion capture for the "Real Emotion" opening [[full motion video]]&lt;ref name="JapaneseGameGraphics"/&gt; and provided the voice of Lenne in the Japanese version of the game. The English versions of the songs are sung by [[Jade Villalon]] of [[Sweetbox]]. She released extended versions of the songs she sang as bonus tracks on the Japanese release of her album, [[Adagio (Sweetbox album)|Adagio]]. Koda also released her own English versions of the songs on her CD single ''[[Come with Me (Kumi Koda song)|Come with Me]]''. While similar, the lyrics of [[Koda Kumi]]'s versions differ from those sung by [[Jade Villalon]].

== Versions and merchandise ==

As with ''Final Fantasy X'', an expanded [[international version]] was produced for ''Final Fantasy X-2''. This version of the game, titled ''Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission'', introduces two new dresspheres, an additional "Last Mission" at a location called "Yadonoki Tower," and the option to capture numerous monsters and characters including Tidus, [[Āron|Auron]] and [[Seymour Guado|Seymour]] from ''Final Fantasy X''—as well as several supporting characters from both games—during battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Final Fantasy 10–2 | year=2005 | url=http://www.ffinsider.net/final-fantasy-10-2/ | publisher=Final Fantasy Insider | accessdate=2007-08-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319005254/http://ffinsider.net/final-fantasy-10-2/|archivedate=2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version was never released outside Japan, although the English voices were used for the main story in the International version (not in the Last Mission). Due to this change, parts of the Japanese subtitles were changed or altered to fit the voice-overs. This was detailed in the official strategy book for the International version (see below). In 2005, a compilation featuring ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' and ''Final Fantasy X-2'' was released in Japan under the title ''Final Fantasy X/X-2 Ultimate Box''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=アルティメットヒッツ | url=http://www.square-enix.co.jp/uh/ | publisher=Square Enix Japan | accessdate=2007-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several action figures, books and soundtracks were released by [[Square Enix]]. Among the books that were published were three ''Ultimania'' guidebooks, a series of [[artbook]]s/[[strategy guide]]s published by Square Enix in Japan. They feature original artwork from ''Final Fantasy X-2'', offer gameplay walkthroughs, expand upon many aspects of the game's storyline, and feature several interviews with the game's developers.&lt;ref name="multUlt"&gt;{{cite web |date=2001-08-20 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/08/20/final-fantasy-x-ultimania-guide |title=Final Fantasy X Ultimania Guide |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="revisedUlt"&gt;{{cite web|date=2009-04-01 |url=http://kotaku.com/5192919/final-fantasy-vii-ultimania-book-getting-revision |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wud6gRLK?url=http://m.kotaku.com/5192919/final-fantasy-vii-ultimania-book-getting-revision |archivedate=2011-03-03 |title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Book Getting Revision |publisher=Kotaku |last=Ashcraft |first=Brian |accessdate=2013-03-05 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three books in the series: ''Final Fantasy X-2 Ultimania'', ''Final Fantasy X-2 Ultimania Ω'', and ''Final Fantasy X-2: International+Last Mission Ultimania''.&lt;ref name="BSff102"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ultimania シリーズ［13］ |url=http://www.bent.co.jp/main/works/um13/naiyo_fr.htm |publisher=Studio BentStuff |accessdate=2013-03-01 |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307080947/http://www.bent.co.jp/main/works/um13/naiyo_fr.htm |archivedate=2012-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEgameguide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.square-enix.co.jp/magazine/gamebooks/ult/index.html |title=アルティマニアシリーズ　公式ページ {{!}} Square Enix Game Books Online |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Square Enix]] |accessdate=2014-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60kN5xRoI?url=http://www.square-enix.co.jp/magazine/gamebooks/ult/index.html |archivedate=2011-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar three-book series was produced for ''Final Fantasy X''.&lt;ref name="BSff10s"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ultimania シリーズ［7］ |url=http://www.bent.co.jp/main/works/um07/naiyo_fr.htm |publisher=Studio BentStuff |accessdate=2013-03-01 |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518062555/http://www.bent.co.jp/main/works/um07/naiyo_fr.htm |archivedate=2012-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BSff10b"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ultimania シリーズ［8］ |url=http://www.bent.co.jp/main/works/um08/naiyo_fr.htm |publisher=Studio BentStuff |accessdate=2013-03-01 |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409112910/http://www.bent.co.jp/main/works/um08/naiyo_fr.htm |archivedate=2010-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BSff10o"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ultimania シリーズ［9］ |url=http://www.bent.co.jp/main/works/um09/naiyo_fr.htm |publisher=Studio BentStuff |accessdate=2013-03-01 |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409112915/http://www.bent.co.jp/main/works/um09/naiyo_fr.htm |archivedate=2010-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaming peripheral company Hori produced PlayStation 2 controllers modeled after the Tiny Bee guns Yuna uses in ''Final Fantasy X-2''. These controllers were released only in Japan. They were re-released in a new silver box to coincide with the release of ''Final Fantasy X-2: International+Last Mission''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.play-asia.com/final-fantasy-x-2-tiny-bee-controller/13/7025w |title=Final Fantasy X-2 Tiny Bee Controller |publisher=Play-Asia |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also released a vertical stand for the console with a ''Final Fantasy X-2'' logo that lights up in blue color when plugged into a powered console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.play-asia.com/final-fantasy-x-2-vertical-stand/13/7025v |title=Final Fantasy X-2 Vertical Stand |publisher=Play-Asia |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, 2011, Square Enix announced that ''Final Fantasy X'' would be re-released in high-definition for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Vita]], in celebration of the game's 10 year anniversary. Yet rumors spread that it would also include its sequel ''Final Fantasy X-2'' &lt;ref name="FFX-2 HD 1"&gt;{{cite web | date=September 13, 2011 | title=Final Fantasy X HD Remake Coming to Vita and PS3| url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/119/1194253p1.html | work=IGN | publisher=News Corporation | accessdate=September 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, production of the game had started.

''Final Fantasy X-2 Last Mission'' was later announced to be remastered in HD and included as well.

Multimedia website [[IGN]] felt that the game's shift in tone is "part of what makes [it] so intriguing," labeling the storyline "a deep political drama" that "always manages to keep from taking things too seriously."&lt;ref name="ignreview"&gt;{{cite web | last=Dunham|first=Jeremy | date=2003-11-07 | title=Final Fantasy X-2 Review | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/458/458474p1.html | publisher=IGN | accessdate=2006-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also commented that the game "treats its history with intelligence"&lt;ref name="ignreview"/&gt; and "its returning characters...just as clever".&lt;ref name="ignreview"/&gt; Further positive reaction came from RPGamer, with one staff reviewer summarizing ''X-2'' as "a light-hearted fun game" that "may ... be the most enjoyable thing to come from the series in several years",&lt;ref name="rpgamer"&gt;{{cite web | last=Alley | first=Jake | year=2003 | title=Final Fantasy X-2 – Review | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ffx-2/reviews/ffx-2strev1.html | publisher=RPGamer | accessdate=2006-07-31 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930022326/http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ffx-2/reviews/ffx-2strev1.html | archivedate=2007-09-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while another regarded its battle system as innovative and "very simple to navigate".&lt;ref name="rpgamer2"&gt;{{cite web | last=Przestrzelski | first=Steve | year=2004 | title=Final Fantasy X-2 – Review | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ffx-2/reviews/ffx-2strev4.html | publisher=RPGamer | accessdate=2006-07-31 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202917/http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ffx-2/reviews/ffx-2strev4.html | archivedate=2007-09-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's stylistic changes from past ''Final Fantasy'' titles sparked negative comments, with some perceiving it as a change in the spirit of the franchise. Among these were the game's status as ''Final Fantasy''{{'}}s first direct sequel and the change from a tragic atmosphere in ''Final Fantasy X'' to a dominantly lighthearted tone in ''Final Fantasy X-2''.&lt;ref name="gamespot" /&gt; In their review, gaming website [[GameSpot]] commented that "Some of the missions ... come off as downright silly and a bit tacked on". Additionally, they felt that the game's non-linear style makes it "[lack] the singular narrative thrust of ''Final Fantasy X'' or other typical RPGs, and the storyline can feel a little nebulous and disjointed as a result". Moreover, GameSpot commented that "trivial minigames have been creeping into the Final Fantasy games at an alarming rate over the last few years, and in this regard, ''X-2'' is definitely the most egregious offender in the series". Despite these comments, they praised the battle system as a "welcome addition", while regarding its voice-overs and [[internationalization and localization|localizations]] as "outstanding".&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt;

Another aspect of the game that has attracted criticism is the reuse of graphical designs from ''Final Fantasy X''.&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1UP"&gt;{{cite web | author=1UP Staff | title=Final Fantasy X-2 Review | url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3112507 | publisher=[[1UP.com]] | accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="egm"&gt;{{cite web | last=Bettenhausen|first=Shane | title=Final Fantasy X-2 Review | url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3117623 | publisher=[[1UP.com]] | accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ignreview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rpgamer3"&gt;{{cite web | last=Raven | first=Red | year=2003 | title=Final Fantasy X-2 – Review | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ffx-2/reviews/ffx-2strev3.html | publisher=RPGamer | accessdate=2006-07-31 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BVVvWJ8v?url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ffx-2/reviews/ffx-2strev3.html | archivedate=2012-10-18 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer at RPGamer commented that "there is little question that the graphics in ''Final Fantasy X-2'' could rival just about any other RPG on the market ... [but] one does ''not'' get ... [the impression] that the graphics have been improved in any significant way since ''Final Fantasy X''",&lt;ref name="rpgamer3"/&gt; while GameSpot said "''X-2'' doesn't look that much better than ''X'' did two years ago".&lt;ref name="gamespot" /&gt; ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' regarded this reuse of [[Source code|code]] as "[tripping up] in the one area where ''Final Fantasy'' titles usually shine".&lt;ref name="egm"/&gt;

The game's soundtrack was met with mixed feelings, because ''Final Fantasy X-2''{{'}}s score was the first in the series without input from [[Nobuo Uematsu]],&lt;ref name="rpgfan"&gt;{{cite web | last=Mattich|first=Ryan | year=2003 | title=Final Fantasy X-2 – Review | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/finalfantasy10-2/ffx2.html | publisher=RPGFan | accessdate=2006-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; composer of all previous games in the main series, and because of the change to a distinct J-pop atmosphere.&lt;ref name="1UP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="egm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rpgamer3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="j-pop"&gt;{{cite web | author=Oda | year=2004 | title=Final Fantasy X-2 – J-pop Charlie's Angels!

Despite the negative comments it has received, ''Final Fantasy X-2''{{'}}s critical reception has been largely positive, with IGN summarizing it as "a brilliant and addictive romp through Spira that we're certainly glad to experience",&lt;ref name="ignreview"/&gt; and GameSpot commenting that it is "every bit as poignant, endearing, and engrossing as its forebears," with strengths that "ultimately make ... ''X-2''{{'}}s minor flaws forgivable".&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt; The game maintains an 85/100 approval rating on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="metacritic"&gt;{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy X-2 Reviews | url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/final-fantasy-x-2 | publisher=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=2006-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Floyd Cleveland Miller''' (March 20, 1912 &amp;ndash; June 4, 1988)&lt;ref&gt;[http://sortedbyname.com/pages/m202247.html MILLER, FLOYD C. thru MILLER, FLOYDE]&lt;/ref&gt; was a member of the [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA), who confessed in 1954 to having worked for the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] intelligence agencies.

Miller was born in [[South Bend, Indiana]] and attended school in [[Michigan]]. In 1934, he moved to New York and began writing soap operas for radio station WMCA. Miller joined the Communist Party of the CPUSA in 1936. That same year, Gregory Rabinowitz recruited him to do "opposition work," against rival political organizations. Miller's first year in the business was listening to a wiretap on [[Trotskyist]] leader, [[James P. Cannon|James Cannon]]'s home. Later, he was to [[infiltration tactics|infiltrate]] the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP) and become an activist, while sending reports to the CPUSA and [[OGPU|Soviet intelligence]]. The Trotskyists assigned him to the Sailors Union of the Pacific in 1941, and he became editor of the union's journal, in addition to writing on military affairs for the ''[[Fourth International]]'', a Trotskyist journal, during [[World War II]].  Miller's position gave the Communists a spy in the upper ranks of a rival union. Miller stated later, "My job as a [[Stalinist]] was to keep track of the sailing of all Trotskyite seamen so a Stalinist agent would be at the port and have surveillance on whatever Trotskyites entered the Soviet Union."

Miller's primary KGB contacts, as noted in [[Venona traffic]], were [[Joseph Katz]] and a woman he knew as [[Sylvia Getzoff]], also known as Rebecca Getzoff.

In the first half of 1944, Miller met in New York with [[Jack Soble]] who provided the KGB with microfilm of the page proofs of [[Leon Trotsky]]'s biography of [[Joseph Stalin]]. Miller carried the microfilm to Mexico for the SWP to present to [[Natalia Sedova]], Trotsky's widow.  While in Mexico, Miller spent six weeks living in the Trotsky household.  When he returned to New York, Miller delivered a written report to the KGB.

Miller confessed his covert activities to the [[FBI]] in 1954 and appeared as a witness in [[Robert Soblen]]'s espionage trial in 1961.  He testified that his 1944 Mexican assignment included investigating reports of a budding alliance between Trotskyists, [[anarchist]]s, and other radical groups in contact with French writer [[Victor Serge]], who was living in exile. Miller testified that he was introduced to [[Lucy Booker]], a courier between Miller and Soble in 1945. Reports on the Trotskyists were typed in Booker's residence. Soble informed Miller in 1945 that he was being transferred to another [[Agent handling|controller]], and it was then that he was introduced to Soblen. Miller's story is confirmed by numerous decrypted Venona documents.  Miller stated that he ceased activities for the KGB in 1945, and began writing children's books.

[[File:StateLibQld 1 165343 Gilbert Stephen Casey, labour organiser and agitator.jpg|thumb|Gilbert Stephen Casey (1924)]]
'''Gilbert Stephen Casey''' (1856 – 2 October 1946) was a [[trade unionist]], agitator of the early [[Australian labour movement]] and a [[utopian socialism|utopian socialist]].

== Personal life ==

Gilbert Stephen Casey was born in 1856 in [[County Clare]], Ireland, the son of Patrick Casey, a storeman, and his wife Susan (née O'Dea). With little formal education, Casey went to sea and came into contact with trade unionism. He probably immigrated to [[Queensland]], Australia, in October 1883 and worked as a seaman, bushworker, coalminer and wharflabourer.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

On 14 October 1883 Casey married his first wife, Alice Tighe (née Shile), who had already been married twice before. She left him in 1895 in [[New Australia]] and he then married Maria Antonia Sosa, a Paraguayan woman.

With Maria and their two sons, Casey raised cattle at ''La Novia'', "dabbled in sidelines{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}" at [[Asunción]], and wrote occasional letters and articles for the Australian Labor press. Casey was for many years the chief of police at ''New Australia'',&lt;ref name="adb"&gt;Sullivan, Rodney, [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/casey-gilbert-stephen-5528 'Casey, Gilbert Stephen (1856–1946)'], ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/casey-gilbert-stephen-5528/text9415 accessed 9 July 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; until he died on 2 October 1946 in [[New Australia]], Paraguay.

== Political life ==

In February 1886, Casey was associated with the ''Queensland Maritime Council'' through the ''Brisbane Wharf Labourers' Union'' which he helped form the previous year. In 1888 the council sent him on an organizing mission to [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]], [[Bundaberg]], [[Rockhampton]], [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]] and [[Townsville]]; there he helped to found the ''Townsville Trades and Labor Council'' (T.L.C.).

As a member of the ''Brisbane T.L.C.'', Casey became a trustee for the ''Trades Hall'' reserve, worked for the June 1889 reconstitution of the council into the ''Australian Labour Federation'' (A.L.F), and became a member of its central district council.

In December 1889, along with Thomas Glassey and Albert Hinchcliffe, Casey successfully went to and brought the bush unions into the A.L.F. Casey was appointed full-time{{Elucidate|reason=where? presumably the A.L.F|date=July 2011}} in April 1890 and in his first frenetic three months organized new unions and established [[Labour council|district councils]] of the A.L.F. at Maryborough, Rockhampton, [[Charters Towers, Queensland|Charters Towers]] and Townsville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71368302 |title=IN THE WORKER'S WORLD. |newspaper=[[The Worker (Brisbane)|The Worker]] |location=Brisbane |date=16 April 1940 |accessdate=26 May 2012 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1890 Casey was appointed the first chairman of the board of trustees of the ''[[The Worker (Brisbane)|Worker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article70862313 |title=BOARD OF TRUSTEES' ANNOUNCEMENTS. |newspaper=[[The Worker (Brisbane)|The Worker]] |location=Brisbane |date=1 March 1890 |accessdate=24 May 2012 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71416765 |title=FIRST "WORKER" BOARD OF TRUSTEES. |newspaper=[[The Worker (Brisbane)|The Worker]] |location=Brisbane |date=6 March 1950 |accessdate=24 May 2012 |page=17 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- After the first Australian banks and economy crisis of 1890 -- Extra German info? -- and the defeat of the Australian unions -- German slight POV? --&gt;Embroiled in the [[1890 Australian maritime dispute|1890 maritime strike]], and [[1891 Australian shearers' strike|1891 shearers' strike]], Casey preferred a [[general strike]] over Australia when more pragmatic union leaders wanted to negotiate a return to work, lest the defeats are turned into a rout. His extremism attracted attacks by anti-labor forces.

In the newspaper the ''Judge'', he was accused of incest and, in subsequent libel action, he was awarded [[contemptuous damages]] which did not cover costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article52345783 |title=PUBLIC MEETING. |newspaper=[[The Morning Bulletin]] |location=Rockhampton, Qld. |date=30 May 1891 |accessdate=26 May 2012 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article70863142 |title=SMOKE-HO. |newspaper=[[The Worker (Brisbane)|The Worker]] |location=Brisbane |date=4 April 1891 |accessdate=26 May 2012 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Barcaldine, Queensland|Barcaldine]], he was accused during the shearers' strike in 1891 of arson and jailed for two weeks before he was discharged without the charge being heard. &lt;!-- because of heart problems. {{Clarify|Is this a translation issue, or does the German page have another source|date=July 2011}} --&gt;

Casey was a self-proclaimed evangelist for the 'new unionism', believing it would radically transform existing society, which he saw as dominated by "those who rob legally, those who rob illegally and those who it pays to maintain the law".&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; After the failed shearers' strike in 1891, he found it hard to accept the A.L.F's support for the founding of the [[Australian Labor Party]] because he felt it would be easy prey for "wirepullers".&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; He became a fervent member of [[William Lane]]'s ''[[New Australia]] Co-operative Settlement Association'', which had set itself the goal to establish a utopia at ''New Australia'', South America. Casey donated his Brisbane home as a prize in a fund-raising raffle and left on 31 December 1893 with his wife with the second group of settlers on the ship ''Royal Tar Australia'' &lt;!-- more German alternate source --&gt; on the way to ''New Australia'' in [[Paraguay]].

He remained in the Australian ''colony of New Australia'' even after it split&lt;!-- with William Lane who went on to form another ''colony of Cosme'' -- more German alternate source --&gt;, returning to Australia briefly in 1894 to try to obtain further support for the colony. He was elected president of the ''Sociedad Co-operativa Colonizadora Nueva Australia'' in 1896, though the colony's income improved rapidly ''after'' his defeat in 1900. He was the police chief of ''New Australia'' until he died on 2 October 1946.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

'''Harsusi''' (Arabic: لغة حرسوسية also known as  Ḥarsūsī, Harsiyyet, Hersyet, or Harsi `Aforit) is a [[Semitic language]] of [[Oman]], spoken by the [[Harasis]] people. It is classified as a moribund language,&lt;ref name=morris&gt;Morris, M. 2007. "[http://www.al-bab.com/bys/articles/morris07.htm The pre-literate, non-Arabic languages of Oman and Yemen.]" Lecture conducted from Anglo-Omani and British-Yemeni Societies.&lt;/ref&gt; with an estimated 600-1000 speakers in [[Jiddat al-Harasis]], a stony desert in south-central [[Oman]]. It is closely related to [[Mehri language|Mehri]].&lt;ref name=peterson&gt;Peterson, J.E. "[http://jepeterson.net/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/Oman_Diverse_Society_Southern_Oman.pdf Oman's Diverse Society: Southern Oman.]" In: ''Middle East Journal'' 58.2, 254-269.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General information==
Harsusi first came to the attention of outside scholars in 1937, when it was mentioned by [[Bertram Thomas]] in his book ''Four Strange Tongues of South Arabia.''&lt;ref name=morris /&gt; While certain scholars have claimed that Harsusi is a dialect of the more widely spoken Mehri language,&lt;ref&gt;Maisel, S., and Shoup, J. 2009. ''[http://122.129.75.35/articles/0313344426.pdf Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Arab States Today: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Arab States.]'' Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; most maintain that they are mutually intelligible but separate languages .&lt;ref name=peterson /&gt; Harsusi, like all  the Modern South Arabian languages, is unwritten,&lt;ref name=morris /&gt; though there have been recent efforts to create a written form using an [[Arabic]]-based script.&lt;ref name=eades&gt;Eades, D. "[http://elar.soas.ac.uk/deposit/0314 The documentation and ethnolinguistic analysis of Modern South Arabian: Harsusi.]" ''Endangered Languages Archive''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Harasis people were for centuries the only human inhabitants of Jiddat al-Harasis, the language developed in relative isolation.&lt;ref&gt;Chatty, D. 2013. “[http://www.nomadsinoman.com/nomadic-life/articles/articles/negotiating-authenticity-and-translocality-in-oman-2013 Negotiating Authenticity and Translocality in Oman: The 'Desertscapes' of the Harasiis Tribe.]” In S. Wippel (ed.). ''Regionalizing Oman'' 6, 129-145. Springer Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as most Harasis children now attend Arabic-language schools and are literate in Arabic, Harsusi is spoken less in the home, meaning that it is not being passed down to future generations.&lt;ref name=morris /&gt; Though the discovery of oil in the area and the conservation project for the re-introduced [[oryx]] herd have provided many job opportunities for Harsusi men,&lt;ref name=peterson /&gt; these factors have also caused many Harasis to speak Arabic and Mehri in addition to or in place of Harsusi. These pressures led one researcher to conclude in 1981 that "within a few generations Harsusi will be replaced by Arabic, more specifically by the Omani Arabic standard dialect"&lt;ref&gt;Swiggers, P. 1981. “A Phonological Analysis of the Ḥarsūsi Consonants.” In: ''Arabica''  28.2/3, 358-361.&lt;/ref&gt; though this has not yet materialized.

[[UNESCO]] has categorised Harsusi as a language that is "definitely endangered".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), "[http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/en/atlasmap/language-id-1950.html Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]", 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human rights in [[Greece]]''' are observed by various organizations. The country is a signatory to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]] and the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]]. The [[Constitution of Greece|Greek constitution]] also guarantees fundamental human rights to all Greek citizens.

==Amnesty International==
According to Amnesty International's [http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/Regions/Europe-and-Central-Asia/Greece 2007 report] on Greece, there are problems in the following areas:
*Treatment of migrants and refugees.
*Treatment of [[conscientious objector]]s to [[Conscription in Greece|military service]].
*Failure to grant necessary protection to women victims of [[domestic violence]] or trafficking and [[forced prostitution]].
*The report also highlights cases involving arbitrary arrests in the context of the '[[war on terror]]' and Greece's conviction by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] for violating [[European Convention on Human Rights#Article 9 - right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion|Article 9]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] by convicting an [[Muslim minority of Greece#Grievances|unofficial]] [[mufti]] for 'usurping the function of a minister of a "known religion"'.&lt;ref&gt;[[ECHR]], 13 July 2006, [http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=806689&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ''Agga v. Greece (n°3)''], 32186/02&lt;/ref&gt;

==US State Department==

The US Department of State's [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2007/100562.htm 2007 report] on human rights in Greece identified the following issues:
*Cases of abuse by security forces, particularly of illegal immigrants and Roma.
*Overcrowding and harsh conditions in some prisons.
*Detention of undocumented migrants in squalid conditions.
*Restrictions and administrative obstacles faced by members of non‑Orthodox religions.
*Detention and deportation of unaccompanied or separated immigrant minors, including asylum seekers.
*Limits on the ability of ethnic minority groups to self-identify, and discrimination against and social exclusion of ethnic minorities, particularly Roma.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4450">The '''Huron Mountain Club''' is a private club whose land holdings in [[Marquette County, Michigan|Marquette County]], in the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]], constitute one of the largest tracts of [[primeval forest]] in the [[Great Lakes]] region. Formed circa 1890, the club consists of 50 dwellings clustered inside about {{convert|13000|acre|mi2 ha}} of private land, encompassing the [[Huron Mountains]] area. The club was founded to establish a remote hunting and fishing club for outdoor enthusiasts. The original charter limited membership to 50 partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pace |first=Emily |date=May 9, 2008 |title=Behind the Gates |quote=The club has a limit of 100 associates and 50 permanent member families who own cabins on the nearly 26,000 acres of land |url=http://www.uppermichiganssource.com/news/news_story.aspx?id=132343 |work=Upper Michigan's Source |location=Negaunee, MI |publisher=[[WLUC-TV]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323014538/http://www.uppermichiganssource.com/news/news_story.aspx?id=132343 |archivedate=March 23, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The property encompasses several lakes and approximately {{convert|10000|acre|mi2 ha}} of [[old-growth forest]].

Through its long association with the non-profit [[Huron Mountain Wildlife Foundation]], the Huron Mountain Club has been the site of a wide range of research in field biology and geology.

'''Karl Alexander Müller''' (born April 20, 1927) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[physicist]] and [[Nobel laureate]]. He received the [[Nobel Prize]] in Physics in 1987 with [[Georg Bednorz]] for their work in [[High-temperature superconductivity|superconductivity in ceramic materials]].

==Biography==
Müller was born in [[Basel]], Switzerland, on 20 April 1927, to Irma (née Feigenbaum) and Paul Müller. His family immediately moved to [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]], where his father was studying music. Alex and his mother then moved to [[Dornach]], near [[Basel]], to the home of his grandparents. Then they moved to [[Lugano]], in the [[Italian language|Italian]]-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], where he learned to speak Italian fluently. His mother died when he was 11.

In the spring of 1956 Müller married Ingeborg Marie Louise Winkler. They had a son, Eric, in the summer of 1957, and a daughter, Sylvia, in 1960. [http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F31540.php]

==Education==
After his mother’s death, Müller was sent to school at the Evangelical College in [[Schiers]], in the eastern part of Switzerland. Here he studied from 1938 to 1945, obtaining his baccalaureate (Matura).

Müller then enrolled in the Physics and Mathematics Department of the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] (ETH) in [[Zürich]]. He took courses by [[Wolfgang Pauli]], who made a deep impression on him. After receiving his [[Diplom]], he worked for one year, then returned to ETH for a PhD, submitting his thesis at the end of 1957.

==Career==
Müller joined the [[Battelle Memorial Institute]] in [[Geneva]], soon becoming the manager of a magnetic resonance group. During this time he became a [[lecturer]] at the [[University of Zürich]]. In 1963 he accepted an offer as a ''research staff member'' at the [[IBM Research|IBM Zürich Research Laboratory]] in [[Rüschlikon]], where he remained until his retirement. In parallel, he maintained his affiliation with University of Zurich where he was appointed professor in 1970. From 1972 to 1985 Müller was manager of the ZRL physics department. In 1982 he became an [[IBM Fellow]]. He received an honorary doctorate from [[Technical University of Munich]] and [[University of Geneva]]. In 1987 (before winning the Nobel Prize) he got an [[honorary degree]] (''laurea honoris causa'') in Physics from the [[University of Pavia]].

==Research==
[[File:Karl Alex Muller LANL.jpg|thumb|Müller in 2002]]

For his undergraduate diploma work, Müller studied under G. Busch. He worked on the [[Hall Effect]] in [[tin|gray tin]], a [[semimetal]].

Between his [[undergraduate degree]] and beginning his [[graduate student|graduate studies]], he worked for one year in the Department of Industrial Research at ETH on the [[Eidophor]] large-scale display system.

At [[IBM]] his research for almost 15 years centered on SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[strontium titanate]]) and related [[perovskite]] compounds. He studied their photochromic properties when doped with various [[transition metal|transition-metal]] [[ion]]s; their [[chemical bond|chemical binding]], [[ferroelectricity|ferroelectric]] and soft-mode properties; and the critical and multicritical phenomena of their structural [[phase transition]]s. Important highlights of this research have been published in a book written together with [[Tom Kool]] from the [[University of Amsterdam]] (publisher: [[World Scientific]]).

==Nobel Prize–winning work==
{{main| High-temperature superconductivity}}

In the early 1980s, Müller began searching for substances that would become superconductive at higher temperatures. The highest [[superconductivity|critical temperature]] (''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) attainable at that time was about 23 [[Kelvin|K]]. In 1983 Müller recruited Georg Bednorz to IBM, to help systematically test various oxides. A few recent studies had indicated these materials might superconduct. In 1986 the two succeeded in achieving superconductivity in [[lanthanum barium copper oxide]] (LBCO) at a temperature of 35 [[kelvin|K]]. Over the previous 75 years the critical temperature had risen from 11 K in 1911 to 23 [[Kelvin|K]] in 1973 where it had remained for 13 years. Thus 35 K was incredibly high by the prevailing standards of superconductivity research. This discovery stimulated a great deal of additional research in [[high-temperature superconductivity]], leading to the discovery of compounds such as [[BSCCO]] (''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 107 K) and [[YBCO]] (''T'''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 92 K).

They reported their discovery in the June 1986 issue of ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik B]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = J. G. Bednorz and K. A. Müller| title = Possible highT&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconductivity in the Ba−La−Cu−O system| journal = Z. Phys.

W. Chu|Paul Chu]] at the [[University of Houston]] had each independently confirmed their result. A couple of months later Chu achieved superconductivity at 93 K in [[YBCO]], triggering a stampede of scientific interest exemplified by the 1987 "[[Woodstock of physics]]", at which Müller was a featured presenter.&lt;ref name = "Chang"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/06/science/06supe.html|title=Physicists Remember When Superconductors Were Hot|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|date=March 6, 2007|work=New York Times|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 Müller and Bednorz were jointly awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in physics—the shortest time between the discovery and the prize award for any scientific Nobel.

For the [[Stop consonant|stops]] and [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] there is a four-way distinction in [[phonation]] between [[Tenuis consonant|tenuis]] {{IPA|/p/}}, [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] {{IPA|/b/}}, [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] {{IPA|/pʰ/}} and [[breathy voice]]d {{IPA|/bʱ/}} series. {{Harvtxt|Thakur|1975|pp=175–8}} lists as separate [[phoneme]]s aspirated correlates of {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/j/}}, {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/ɽ/}}, {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/ɭ/}}, but describes the aspiration as a voiceless [[Pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] friction. {{IPA|/n̪/}} is dental, but becomes alveolar if the next syllable contains a [[retroflex consonant]]. {{IPA|/ŋ/}} and {{IPA|/ɲ/}} are rare, but contrast with the other nasals word-medially between vowels. {{IPA|/ɳ/}}, {{IPA|/ɭ/}} and {{IPA|/ɽ/}}, together with their aspirated correlates, don't occur in  the beginning of words.{{sfn|Thakur|1975|p=180|ps = . An exception is the word {{IPA|[ɽəbɑːɳɑː]}} "to throw".}} The [[glottal stop]] occurs only between a vowel and {{IPA|/ɳ/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/r/}} or {{IPA|/l/}}, e.g. {{IPA|[kɑːʔɭ]}} "a trumpet", which contrasts with {{IPA|[kɑːɭ]}} "famine". The [[Voiceless pharyngeal fricative|pharyngeal fricative]] {{IPA|/ħ/}} historically derives from {{IPA|/s/}} and occurs word-finally, e.g. {{IPA|[ɡʱɑːħ]}} "grass", {{IPA|[biːħ]}} "twenty".{{sfn|Thakur|1975|p=181}}

The '''Limba''' language, ''Hulimba'', is an erstwhile [[Atlantic languages|Atlantic language]] of Sierra Leone. It is not closely related to other languages and appears to form its own branch of the [[Niger–Congo family]]. Dialects include ''Tonko, Sela, Kamuke'' (or ''Ke''), ''Wara-wara, Keleng, Biriwa,'' and ''Safroko''. The eastern variety, spoken primarily in [[Guinea]], is quite distinct. Limba has a system of [[noun class]]es, marked by an old, eroded set of prefixes augmented by a newer set of [[enclitic]]s.

==Sounds==

Like neighboring [[Temne language|Temne]], Limba has an unusual contrast among its consonants. It distinguishes [[dental consonant|dental]] and [[alveolar]], but the dental consonants are [[apical consonant|apical]] and the alveolar consonants are [[laminal consonant|laminal]], the opposite of the general pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{SOWL|42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==

===Noun classes===
Noun classes are distinguished by the form of the definite article (class particle) which follows the noun, and sometimes also by a prefix. Roughly, the following classes can be deduced from the examples given by Mary Lane Clarke:&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lane Clarke, ''A Limba–English Dictionary, or, Tampeň ta ka Taluň ta ka Hulimba ha in Huiňkilisi ha'', Houghton, New York, 1922, reprinted 1971 by Gregg International Publishers, Farnborough, England. {{page missing|date=August 2018}} This information is based on the '''Biriwa''' and '''Safroko''' dialects.&lt;/ref&gt;

A. Person Class
* Examples: 
* '''Wukọnọ wo''' - a Kono person; 
* '''sapiri wo''' - crowbar;
* '''kaň wo''' - the sun
Definite article (follows the noun): '''wo'''; pronoun ("he, she, it" as subject): '''wunde, wun'''

B. People Class
* Examples:
* '''Bikọnọ be''' - Kono people;
* '''sapiriň be''' - crowbars;
* ''' bia be''' - people, ancestors
Def. art.: '''be'''; pronoun: '''bende, ben'''

C. Language Class
* Examples:
* '''Hukọnọ ha''' - the Kono language;
* '''hutori ha''' - toe
Def. art.: '''ha'''; pronoun: -?- (presumably this is neuter according to class, and so on through the neuter classes)

D. Country Class

Def. art.: '''ka'''

E. Bodkins Class
* Examples:
* '''tatọli ta''' - bodkins;

* '''ňakeň ňa''' - countries
* '''ňatiň ňa''' - dogs
Def. art.: '''ňa'''

H. Arrival Class
* Examples:
* '''matebeň ma''' - calm (noun);

Def. art.: '''ma'''

I. Needles Class, plurals of H.
* Examples:
* '''masandi ma''' - needles;

Def. art.: '''ki'''

K. Bracelets Class, plurals of J.
* Examples: 
* '''ndambeň ki''' - yams;
* '''nbēni ki''' ("smothered b" as above) - bracelets;
* '''nbuliň ki''' (also with "smothered b") - windpipes
Def. art.: '''ki'''

L. Meat Class
* Examples:
* '''piňkari ba''' - gun, musket;
* '''bọňa ba''' ('''bọňa''' has "smothered b", as above) - path, way;
* '''bara ba''' - meat, flesh
Def. art.: '''ba'''

M. Boxes Class, plurals of L.
* Examples:
* '''piňkariň ba''' - guns, muskets;
* '''bọňeň ba''' ('''bọňeň''' also has "smothered b") - paths, ways;

* '''duba''' - ink (from Mandingo);
* '''kameci''' - late, brown rice

==Literature==
{{main|List of bisexual characters in literature}}
[[Virginia Woolf]]'s ''[[Orlando: A Biography]]'' (1928) is one of the earliest examples of bisexuality in literature. The story about a man who changes into a woman without a second thought, was based on the life of Woolf's then bisexual lover [[Vita Sackville-West]].  Woolf's used the gender switch to avoid the book being banned for homosexual content, and was successful for it.  Following Sackille-West's death, her son [[Nigel Nicolson]] would publish ''[[Portrait of a Marriage]]'', one of her diaries recounting her affair with a woman during her marriage to [[Harold Nicolson]].
Other early examples include works of [[D.H. Lawrence]], such as ''[[Women in Love]]'' (1920), and [[Colette]]'s ''[[Claudine à l'école|Claudine]]'' (1900–1903) series.

In more recent years, following a more [[culturally liberal]] perspective of sexuality, bisexuality has become more common in literature.  This includes the work of [[Bret Easton Ellis]], [[Anne Rice]], and [[Alice Walker]].

===Comic books===

In 1981, ''[[X-Men]]'' writer [[Chris Claremont]] intended the character [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] to be the lover of [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] teammate [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], a shape shifter, and had originally intended for Destiny and Mystique to be Nightcrawler's biological parents, with Mystique taking the form of a man for the conception; however, Marvel editors did not allow gay or bisexual characters at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2005/09/01/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-14/|title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed|last=|first=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=2006-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the series ''[[Wolverine: Origins]]'' introduced a son for popular superhero [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in the form of [[Daken]], his psychopathic bisexual son. In 2010, it was commented on by a writer for the character that for him all sexual conquest is about "control"; Daken regularly seduces male and females to suit his own ends.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=22198&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Peter David]] outed ''X-Men'' and ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' characters [[Rictor]] and [[Shatterstar]] as both [[bisexuality|bisexual]], in a portrayal of their on-panel kiss. Under [[Jeff Loeb]]'s run of ''[[X-Force]]'' in the [[1990s in comics|1990s]], the two characters had been hinted at as being more than friends. In ''X-Factor'' in 2010, David writes of the two bisexual men in a monogamous same sex relationship as two characters with very different needs; Rictor wanting a monogamous loving relationship, and Shatterstar wanting to explore his new world of sexual potential for the first time.&lt;ref name="cbr 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=24992|title=Peter David's "X-Factor": Earth Moving, Star Shattering|first=Chaos|last=Mckenzie|work=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2010-09-19|date=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
The British film ''[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (film)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]'' (1971) portrayed a bisexual male named Bob with a lover of each gender.  This was one of the earliest portrayals to be explicit on the subject of bisexuality, though a film versions of several novels involving bisexuality, such as ''[[Women in Love (film)|Women in Love]]'' (1969) and ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (1964), had been released earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emanuellevy.com/article.php?articleID=2834|title=Sunday, Bloody Sunday Review|last=|first=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film is told from the perspectives of the homosexual partner and the heterosexual partner. Critics of the time described Bob as "shallow", "callous", and "selfish".&lt;ref name="The Bisexual Option"&gt;{{cite book |last=Klein |first=Fritz |authorlink=Fritz Klein (sex researcher) |title=The Bisexual Option |publisher=[[Harrington Park Press]] |year=1993 |location=New York |isbn=1-56023-033-9 |oclc=27187013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the American [[Musical film|musical]] ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' was released as a film, featuring a bisexual protagonist.

[[1975 in film|1975]] saw the release of ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', a musical about a bisexual anti-hero. Memorable films from the 1980s involving bisexuality include the film adaptation of ''[[The Color Purple (1985 film)|The Color Purple]]'' (1985) and ''[[The Hunger (1983 film)|The Hunger]]'' (1983).

1992's ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' received controversy from the [[bisexual community]] for portraying a bisexual as a psychopathic killer.&lt;ref name="Bisexual Representations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glaad.org/programs/cim/birepresentations.php?PHPSESSID=8f0d8d7de0c08b2986df9e94a1b6aa41|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081008153309/http://glaad.org/programs/cim/birepresentations.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-10-08|title=Bisexual Representations|last=|first=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=2008-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It's not uncommon for film adaptations of bisexual-themed novels or plays to remove the bisexual content.&lt;ref name="Bisexual Representations" /&gt; This is seen in films such as ''[[Less Than Zero (film)|Less Than Zero]]'' (1987), ''[[Hair (film)|Hair]]'' (1979), ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]'' (1978) (affair between prisoners becomes fictionalized rape) and ''[[The Dreamers (film)|The Dreamers]]'' (2003).

In 1994, independent film ''[[Go Fish (film)|Go Fish]]'', features a [[lesbian-identified]] character who has sex with a man, and is challenged by a "jury" who question her sexual self-identity. In 1997, [[Kevin Smith]]'s ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' took on the question of sexual identity in a story about a lesbian-identified woman who falls in love with a man.

Bisexuality in film became increasingly common in the early 21st century, seen in studio-produced and high-profile independent films such as ''[[Wild Things (film)|Wild Things]]'' (1998), ''[[Y tu mamá también]]'' (2001), ''[[Kinsey (film)|Kinsey]]'' (2004), ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'' (2004), ''[[Brokeback Mountain (film)|Brokeback Mountain]]'' (2005, receiving numerous awards), ''[[Rent (film)|Rent]]'' (2005), [[Cloud Atlas (film)|Cloud Atlas]] (2012), and ''[[Call Me by Your Name (film)|Call Me by Your Name]]'' (2017, receiving numerous awards). In [[2007 in film|2007]], the musical ''[[Love Songs (2007 film)|Love Songs]]'' was released in [[France]] to considerable success and a [[Golden Palm]] nomination.

The 2008 documentary ''Bi the Way'', which aired on the [[LGBT]] cable TV network [[Logo (TV channel)|Logo]] in August 2009&lt;ref name="logo"&gt;"[http://www.logoonline.com/video/bi-the-way/1616890/playlist.jhtml Bi the Way]", Logo online, August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; followed the lives of five bisexual Americans ages 11 to 28. The movie talked about bisexuality in general and featured scientific studies, interviews with bisexual leaders and media portrayals.

==Television==
Bisexual characters appear in television series such as [[Karen Walker (Will &amp; Grace)|Karen Walker]] (portrayed by  [[Megan Mullally]]) in the US [[situation comedy]] ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'' (1998-2006, 2017-present),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afterellen.com/karen-walker-and-the-bisexual-straight-woman/06/2003/&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[All My Children]]'' (1970).  In a 1988 episode of NBC drama TV series ''[[Midnight Caller]]'', "[[After It Happened]]", a bisexual man is depicted as an [[AIDS]] [[Vector (epidemiology)|carrier]] who deliberately infects [[heterosexual|straight women]]. This episode proved highly controversial in the [[bisexual community]].

In 1990, a [[BBC]] mini-series adaptation of ''[[Portrait of a Marriage]]'' aired.  In 2001, another bisexual-themed miniseries aired called ''[[Bob and Rose]]'', written by ''[[Queer as Folk (UK)|Queer as Folk]]'' creator [[Russell T Davies]].  The mini-series is about a gay man who falls in love with a straight woman, and is based on the experience of a friend of Davies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/screen/story/0,6903,545464,00.html|title=''A Rose by any other name''|last=Davies|first=Russell|date=2001-09-02|publisher=|accessdate=2008-08-13 | work=The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main character in ''[[Strangers With Candy]]'', Jerry Blank is bisexual.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The characters [[Brittany Pierce]] and [[Santana Lopez]] (portrayed respectively by [[Heather Morris]] and [[Naya Rivera]]) from the musical TV series  ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' (2009–2015) are depicted as cheerleaders, who have dated other characters from both genders and even each other. Later on the show, Santana is revealed as a lesbian who was struggling and denying her sexuality, while Brittany is bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;http://dailytrojan.com/2011/03/21/glee-paves-way-for-serious-representation-of-gay-characters/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://themostrandomfandom.tumblr.com/post/8782558098/they-must-have-sensed-that-i-was-a-lesbian-on-naya&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Torchwood]]'' (2006), created by Russell T Davies, is a spin-off of long-running British science fiction television programme ''[[Doctor Who]]''.  The show is based in Cardiff, Wales, and deals with several LGBT themes, specifically bisexuality. Each of the main characters in ''Torchwood'' has same-sex encounters at some point in the first season,&lt;ref name="gay times"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davies has said that he hopes to defy audience expectations of [[monosexuality|monosexual]] characters:

{{quote|Without making it political or dull, this is going to be a very bisexual programme.  I want to knock down the barriers so we can't define which of the characters is gay. We need to start mixing things up, rather than thinking, 'This is a gay character and he'll only ever go off with men.&lt;ref name="gay times"/&gt;|Russel T. Davies}}

The lead male in the series, Captain [[Jack Harkness]] originated in parent series ''Doctor Who'', which is considered a family show, as opposed to ''Torchwood'''s adult orientation.  Davies has also described Jack  as [[omnisexual]]. Other bisexual characters in ''Torchwood'' are Jack's lovers [[Ianto Jones|Ianto]] and [[List of Torchwood characters#Captain John Hart|Captain John]], and Jack's colleague [[Toshiko Sato|Toshiko]].

The high rated [[MTV]] series, ''[[A Shot At Love With Tila Tequila]]'' (2007), is a bisexual [[reality show]].

The [[Showcase (U.S. TV channel)|Showcase]] series ''[[Lost Girl (TV series)|Lost Girl]]'' features a bisexual succubus as the main character and there are several bisexual characters and themes throughout the show including a bisexual love triangle.
In a 2008 ''[[New York Times]]'' interview, actor [[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]] revealed he is working on a television project called ''Bi-Coastal'' about "a guy with a wife and kids in California and a boyfriend in New York."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/06/theater/06mcge.html?8dpc=&amp;_r=3&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1218596404-GpRhqaBreKmsEu7JVLJb1Q|title=New York Times Interview|last=Mcgee|first=Celia|date=2008-07-06|publisher=|accessdate=2008-08-14 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] drama ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' features [[Callie Torres]], a bisexual main character portrayed by [[Sara Ramirez]]. The show portrays Callie's first experience with a woman and her realization that she is bisexual. She eventually goes on to marry fellow surgeon [[Arizona Robbins]].

The [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] television series ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' features a bisexual female doctor, [[Thirteen (House)|Remy "Thirteen" Hadley]], played by [[Olivia Wilde]], from season four onwards. The same network had earlier aired the television series ''[[The O.C.]]'', which for a time featured bisexual [[Alex Kelly (The O.C.)|Alex Kelly]] (also played by [[Olivia Wilde]]), the local rebellious hangout spot's manager, as a love interest of [[Marissa Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;["Games". Writer: Eli Attie; Director: Deran Sarafian. House. Fox. No. 9, season 4.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nickelodeon]] [[animated series]] ''[[The Legend of Korra]]'' features main protagonist [[Korra]], a teenage girl, as well as major character [[Asami Sato]], a young female industrialist. The two girls are both initially romantically interested in the same man, but after putting their feelings aside, they manage to become friends. Over the course of the series, their relationship is shown growing and developing, and eventually culminates in the final scene, which indicated the start of a romantic relationship between Korra and Asami. The series was lauded for its unprecedented representation of bisexuality in American children's television, as well as its portrayal of a same-sex relationship between bisexual women.&lt;ref name="IGN 24 December 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=IGN Staff|title=THE LEGEND OF KORRA: IGN EDITORS REACT TO THE ENDING AND KORRASAMI|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/24/the-legend-of-korra-ign-editors-react-to-the-ending-and-korrasami|accessdate=16 January 2015|work=[[IGN]]|date=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
In 2011, presenter and singer-songwriter [[Tom Robinson]] on [[BBC Radio 4]] explored the topic of bisexuality.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b014pw7d/Its_My_Story_Getting_Bi/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
[[David Bowie]]'s androgynous appearance and open bisexuality was reflected in some of his songs, in particular "[[John, I'm Only Dancing]]" (1972). The original video directed by [[Mick Rock]], featuring [[androgyny|androgynous]] dancers from [[Lindsay Kemp]]'s [[mime artist|mime]] troupe, was banned by ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.&lt;ref name="Strange Fascination"&gt;David Buckley (1999).

In 1995, [[Jill Sobule]]'s song "I Kissed a Girl" was met with considerable success. The song told the story of flirtation between two suburban female friends, both with male partners.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In 2003, [[Britney Spears]] staged a kiss with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] (who also kissed [[Christina Aguilera]] in the same performance) on an [[MTV Video Music Awards]] performance that would continue to fuel [[bisexual chic]], and at the time many news and tabloid outsources referred to it as "[[lesbian chic]]",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1477729/20030828/spears_britney.jhtml?headlines=true&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://extratv.warnerbros.com/dailynews/extra/09_03/09_02c.html&lt;/ref&gt; since it was clear from her impending marriage to [[Kevin Federline]] that Spears was certainly not a [[monosexual]] lesbian. The kiss is seen{{By whom|date=December 2015}} as a publicity stunt but helped to fuel the ever-growing trend. In November 2006, [[Paris Hilton]] appeared in public with her hand on Spears' left breast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playfuls.com/news_00001729_Britney_Spears_Groped_By_Paris_Hilton.html Playfuls.com - Play your life!&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Katy Perry]] released a song called "[[I Kissed a Girl]]", though it is unrelated to the Jill Sobule version. It was by received ''Billboard'' Top 40 success.  The song is about a girl's curiosity about kissing another girl, though she has a boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;http://perezhilton.com/2013-10-22-katy-perry-i-kissed-a-girl-bisexuality-w-magazine-5-years-later#sthash.TiQE6bI0.EuDhe7Kr.dpbs&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Lady Gaga]], who is openly bisexual, released her second single "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]", which is about fantasizing about women while in bed with a man.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.contactmusic.com/article/lady-gaga-poker-face-meaning-bisexuality-belvedere-performance_4009730&lt;/ref&gt; It received both critical and commercial success as well as vast praise from the [[bisexual community]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40897">{{Sociology}}
'''Military sociology''' is a subfield within [[sociology]]. It corresponds closely to C. W. Mills's summons to connect the individual world to broader social structures&lt;ref&gt;Crabb, Tyler and Segal, David. 2015. "Military Sociology" in ''Encyclopedia of Public Administration and Public Policy, Third Edition'', Taylor and Francis. pp. 2133-2138.  DOI: 10.1081/E-EPAP3-120053116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mills, C.W. The Sociological Imagination; Oxford University Press: New York, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;. Military sociology aims toward the systematic study of the military as a [[social group]] rather than as a [[Military organization]]. This highly specialized sub-discipline examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct group with [[coercion|coerced]] [[collective action]] based on shared [[Interest group|interests]] linked to survival in [[vocation]] and [[combat]], with purposes and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] that are more defined and narrow than within civil society. Military sociology also concerns [[civil-military relations]] and interactions between other groups or governmental agencies.

==Theory and methodology==
Military Sociology reflects the diversity of methods employed by sociology itself. These include large-scale data analysis, participant observation, social network analysis, survey research, social network analysis, comparative history, case studies etc.&lt;ref&gt;Crabb, Tyler and Segal, David. 2015. "Military Sociology" in ''Encyclopedia of Public Administration and Public Policy, Third Edition'', Taylor and Francis. pp. 2133.  DOI: 10.1081/E-EPAP3-120053116&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary military sociology==
Contemporary military sociology is primarily a result of the [[World War II]] and [[Cold War]] eras. These events initiated the systematic study of military sociology, though it stands to reason that the relationship between the military and society would predate these events. There are numerous topics within military sociology, and it is important to note that its scope is not exclusively limited to the military institution itself or to its members. Rather, military sociology encompasses areas such as [[civilian]]-military relations and the relationship between the military and other military groups or governmental agencies. Other topics within military sociology include:
# the dominant assumptions held by those in the military,
# changes in military members' willingness to fight,
# military unionization,
# military professionalism,
# the increased utilization of women,
# the military industrial-academic complex,
# the military's dependence on research, and
# the institutional and organizational structure of military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3719/is_200107/ai_n8977420 |title=Core Issues and Theory in Military Sociology |accessdate=14 July 2008 |publisher=Journal of Political and Military Sociology |last= Siebold |first= Guy |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military as a society==

===Military as an occupation===
There has been discussion about whether the military should be seen as more of an occupation rather than an institution. Although the military still retains institutional principles (patriotic values, historic traditions, etc.) the military is becoming oriented to the principles of business and [[economics]] and can be fairly categorized as a profession. This can be explored in relating to other professions in the grouping of power and compensation. There are different [[military rank|ranks]] within the military, granting some people more power. Many young people look to the military for compensation benefits and the opportunity to attend college without enormous loans. 

===Military as Profession===
Two leading scholars, [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] and [[Morris Janowitz]], influence the notion of military professionalism in military sociology. Huntington argued that there should be a high degree of autonomy within the military profession over military matters., because civilians did not possess the necessary corporate ness or expertise to oversee military matters. He called this objective control.&lt;ref&gt;Crabb, Tyler and Segal, David. 2015. "Military Sociology" in ''Encyclopedia of Public Administration and Public Policy, Third Edition'', Taylor and Francis. pp. 2133-2138.  DOI: 10.1081/E-EPAP3-120053116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, S.P. ''The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil–Military Relations''; Harvard University Press: Cambridge, MA, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; Janowitz, on the other hand, asserted that the role of the military in modern society was so complex, and with such high stakes that the duty of the professional soldier went well beyond the execution of violence. The elite of the military had an obligation to maintain stable international relations, and this required management expertise and political skills in addition to the classical military officer skillset. Janowitz was concerned that the military profession could become a self-perpetuating, self-serving clique. Therefore, it was important that the military be socially representative of the citizen it served.&lt;ref&gt;Crabb, Tyler and Segal, David. 2015. "Military Sociology" in ''Encyclopedia of Public Administration and Public Policy, Third Edition'', Taylor and Francis. pp. 2133-2138.  DOI: 10.1081/E-EPAP3-120053116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janowitz,M. ''The Professional Soldier: A Social and Political Portrait''; Free Press: Glencoe IL, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sam C. Sarkesian and Robert E. Connor, the military profession holds the view that it is a unique profession. There are six key elements that are paramount in shaping the character of the military profession.  These are listed as:
# The profession has a defined area of competence based on expert knowledge;
# there is a system of continuing education designed so as to maintain professional competence;
# the profession has an obligation to society and must serve it without concern for remuneration;
# it has a system of values that perpetuate professional character and establish and maintain legitimate relationships with society;
# there is an institutional framework within which the profession functions; and
# the profession has control over the system of rewards and punishments and is in a position to determine the quality of those entering the profession.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkesian, Sam C. and Robert E. Connor, Jr. ''The US Military Profession into the 21st Century''. Frank Cass Publishers; Portland, c.1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recruitment practices===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}

Perhaps no other institution places as much emphasis on procedures for [[wikt:assimilation|assimilating]] new members as does the armed forces. Assimilation involves the continuous process of [[recruitment]], selection, [[basic training|training]], and career development. Not only must the new recruit, officer, or enlisted officer learn new and difficult skills. He or she is also expected to master an elaborate code of professional behavior and etiquette, since membership in the military means participation in an organizational community which regulates behavior both on and off the "job". The American Military utilizes the [[Militia|citizen-soldier concept]] to gather military personnel from across the country. This term means the ability to quickly round up or call up troops for war or [[Military deployment|military tour]] at a virtual moment's notice. But once the assignment or tour is over, the military personnel are returned to civilian life.

According to [[Norman A. Hilman]] 2.5 million men were enlisted into military during the peacetime draft. During that rapid transitional period, many soldiers may have felt lost or confused by the differences in their previous life (civilian) and their new military life, which calls for a demand to conform to new orders that are expected to be followed without question. Although, there were many men and now women who have voluntarily joined in the armed forces, there are those who view joining the military and working for the government as selling out. The negative characterization of military life can be a real turn off for most people looking from the outside. Despite the negative thoughts about military life and the incentives of economic security, military recruitment practices changed from a means to help one's country into a way to attain an education back to a need to serve one's country, in recent years. Throughout its changes the enlisting numbers have not declined, they have stayed steady, if not increasing over the years.

===The effects of military life on dependants (and the influence of military dependent subcultures)===
A military family by definition is a unit that may consist of husband and wife and [[military brat|children]] (in many English-speaking countries, called [[military brat]]s, which is a term of respect and endearment, not an insult); with either the husband and/or wife as the primary military enlisted. The emotional [[Stress (biological)|stress]] that a partner can experience, before, during and after a soldier, sailor, marine or airman's deployment is perhaps just as bad mentally, as the one who is fighting in the military. Those whose husbands or wives were [[military deployment|deployed]] for the first time, rated their feelings about the whole experience as being very sad, and found it difficult to cope with the sudden absence of their loved one. However, women or men whose spouses have been deployed prior, coped with the present deployment with more positive reactions. They felt that they had a job to do away from home that was important and they and the rest of their family (children) had to be supportive and take care of things while the family member was away. Children begin taking on more adult responsibilities like: cooking, cleaning, getting groceries, etc. Despite the positive coping skills of some military families, some do not do well on their own coping with the long separation from their family and family members. Stressors and stress reactions of spouses vary over time. What is perceived as stressful before the deployment differs from what is perceived as stressful during and after the deployment.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}  Most deployments last 6–18 months, and during this time, the role that the members of the family believe they should hold changes.  This often makes it difficult for all members of the family.

Approximately one-fifth of all enlisted 18-year-olds and one-third of all junior personnel in the United States Army are married, compared to less than 5% of civilian 18-year-olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Military Family: A Practice Guide for Human Service Providers|last= Martin|first= James |author2=Leora Rosen |author3=Linette Sparacino|year= 2000|publisher= Praeger Publishers|isbn= 978-0-275-96540-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, young military families experience many of the same hardships that can accompany the start of a family in greater numbers than young civilian families.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Life In the U.S. Armed Forces|last= Baker|first= Anni|year= 2008|publisher= Praeger|isbn= 978-0-275-98982-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like young civilian families, young military families may also experience maturity issues, life inexperience, low incomes, and living away from home.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt; But these issues are compounded by the fact that young military families also experience special hardships not experienced by young civilian families.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt; For example, while many young families, both military and civilian, often endure difficulties, civilian families are more likely to have the support of family and friends which is less likely to be an option for military families (e.g. on a [[military base]] stationed in a foreign country).&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;

Another hardship experienced more commonly by military families (compared with civilian families) is frequent [[Relocation (personal)|relocation]]. Approximately 33% of military families relocate every year compared to only 5% of civilian families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Military Compensation in the Age of Two-Income Households: Adding Spouses' Earnings to the Compensation Policy Mix|last= Wardynski|first= 2. Casey|year= 2000|publisher= Rand|location= Santa Monica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special planning must be undertaken by families in which both parents are on active duty, as either could be (re)deployed at any time.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt; (Planning for this contingency can be especially difficult.) In other military families with only one active-duty-parent, the other parent is less likely to stay at home with children as in the past.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt; Rather, they are more likely to find employment and/or attend college, and therefore find constant relocations more stressful due to the commitments to working and studying, respectively.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;

Military families have the option of living at the parents’ place of employment.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt; For families living in an on-base house, they must follow the rules of the base command and the housing office on how to maintain their property and are afforded little privacy.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt; In short, they may experience pressure to conform to the base’s standards of behavior.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt; Some families may opt not to live on base, but off-base housing is usually more expensive and can be inconvenient.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;

===Stress and military service===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}

De Soir suggests there are seven stages in the way partners of married personnel experience stress before, during and after deployment.&lt;ref&gt;p.213, Moelker and van der Kloet&lt;/ref&gt;

;Initial Shock and Protest: This period usually lasts about two weeks. In this stage family members are upset and angry at the news of deployment. This is usually a time of heightened emotions. In the past many families were only given a month's notice to get ready for deployment, but recently many families have been given a year or more of notice of deployment, which might make the stressful time of anticipation even worse. Many recent reports suggest the ideal preparation time for deployment would be 3–5 months.

;Disengagement and Alienation: During the last days prior to departure, couples enter this stage. They experience periods of distancing because of their feelings uncertainty about the future of the mission, but also during that stage, a lot of latent problems or concern may surface that could add more potential stress, such as arguments and confessions that can't be address fully in those last moments before a person's deployment. These moments create a lot of emotional distress.

;Emotional Disorganization: Shortly after the family member has been deployed, there are feelings of sadness and it is possible that symptoms of [[clinical depression]] may begin, along with issues with [[sleep disorder|sleeping]] and problems getting back into the rhythm of life ([[eating disorder]]s). These issues last for about six weeks, perhaps longer, especially, if the deployment doesn't go well or there are reports of bad news to the family. The best way to get family and spouses over this period, is for the deployed personnel to contact their family as soon as they arrive at their destinations as soon as military authority permits. This can help the family feel less stress over the deployment duration. Constant contact is a key part to decreasing a stressful family life.

;Recovery and Stabilization: Usually after six weeks the family will fall back into a more distressed family pattern, and recover by becoming accustomed to the situation of a missing family member who has been deployed. Starting and maintaining a daily routine at this stage is the best way to keep the mind off of what the deployed may be doing or where the deployed may be at this point. The involvement of "home front groups" are essential to military families who need to share and enjoy time with others who have military spouses and partners deployed for long periods of time. Seeking [[support group]]s are one of many ways people cope with stressful issues.

===Age as a factor===
{{Globalize|date=September 2010}}
In the United States, almost half of the enlisted force is below 25 for both men and women&lt;ref name="primary" /&gt; with the average age being 27.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/prhome/poprep2001/chapter3/chapter3_1.htm Chapter 3 - Age]&lt;/ref&gt; The trend of youth is perpetuated by the fact that most people enter into the service at 18 years of age&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/prhome/poprep2001/chapter3/chapter3_1.htm &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] http://www.defenselink.mil/prhome/poprep2005/appendixb/b_01.html&lt;/ref&gt; and leave after only a few years.&lt;ref name="primary" /&gt; This creates a situation in which those with college experience are underrepresented in military as they only make up 8.5% of the military force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/prhome/poprep2002/chapter2/c2_education.htm Chapter 2 - Education]&lt;/ref&gt; Youth inclusion in armed conflict is not a new concept or one restricted to large well organized forces such as the United States military. In various societies over time, youth has been prized in armed conflict. Such instances include the [[Dinka people|Dinka]] of the [[Sudan]], boys who received spears as an [[initiation rite]] between sixteen and eighteen years of age, the nineteenth-century [[Cheyenne]] who joined their first war parties when they were about fourteen, and the female warriors of [[Dahomey]] who were recruited between nine and fifteen.&lt;ref name="youth" /&gt; During the [[American Civil War]], it has been estimated that between 250,000 and 420,000 soldiers under 18 years of age served in Union and Confederate armies, which yields somewhere between 10 and 20 percent of recruits.&lt;ref name="youth"&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/prhome/poprep2002/chapter2/c2_education.htm &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Cite book|author= Rosen, David |year=2005 | title=Armies of the Young |publisher=Greenwood Press | location =Connecticut |isbn= 0-313-22900-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these earlier periods youth was not looked upon in the context of innocence as it is framed today, rather children were seen as naturally existing with adults, as they frequently coexisted with them through apprenticeships and other work. It was not until formal education became more widespread that a change in attitudes towards youth develop, and consequently a prolongation of the perceived youth period.&lt;ref name="youth" /&gt;

===Religion in the military===
{{see also|Religious symbolism in the United States military}}
In the past, all U.S. [[service academies]] required attendance to religious services which in 1972 was found to be unconstitutional by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals]] for the [[District of Columbia]] Circuit in [[Anderson v. Laird]]. Despite this, the Naval Academy still has prayer before meals and attendance is required at these meals. This has caused some students at the Naval Academy to seek legal help from the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]. A comparable practice of pre-meal prayers for compulsory meals at the [[Virginia Military Institute]] was found unconstitutional by the [[4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]] in [[Mellen v. Bunting]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://pewresearch.org/pubs/890/religion-in-the-military|title= Organized Religion’s Role in the Military|accessdate= 2008-07-22|author= |last= Merriam|first= Jesse|date= July 8, 2008|publisher= Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious spectrum of the United States military is comparable to that of the general population. In comparison with the nearest available age group, a demographic of 20- to 39-year-olds that make up eighty percent of the military, there are slight variations. Mainline Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Muslims, and Buddhists are underrepresented, but other Christian religions (such as the Christian and Missionary Alliance, Church of God, Seventh Day Adventists, Assemblies of God, and others) disproportionately overrepresented, at nearly three times the percentage in the applicable demographic. Those reporting atheism or no religion are very slightly overrepresented. None of these differences account for more than a 10% spread, Christians self-identifying as Protestant only constituting the largest discrepancy. The data and other studies suggest that servicemembers may be less likely to identify with mainstream religious organizations than the country's general population.&lt;ref name=primary/&gt;

===Minorities in the military===
Throughout history non-indigenous members of minority groups have been absorbed into military service. Examples of this practice in ancient armies include Hannibal's use of Ethiopian soldiers, the Roman [[Auxilia]], the Byzantine Empire's recruitment of the Middle Eastern population, and the Ottoman Empire's use of religious minorities through the [[Millet system]]. In these cases where military service was voluntary, minorities saw it as an opportunity to progress socially in the society, and perhaps achieve citizenship for themselves and by extension, to their children. For most of the history of minority groups in military organizations, minorities were often segregated from the dominant racial group by forming separate contingents for such groups. This was true in ancient military organizations, but also in a more recent historical context through the French-Canadian regiments of Canada during [[World War I]], and [[World War II]], the British army and their conscription of various minority groups from their conquests during colonialism, and the segregation of minority groups into Caucasian commanded, minority composed, regiments during similar time periods as mentioned previously. In the case of the United States, African-American participation in the military after World War II was high due to the better treatment afforded African-Americans in the military by Caucasian members. With the end of job exclusion by 1954 reenlistment rates increased on average until they were close to double that of Caucasian servicemen. A similar situation arose in the United Kingdom with minority participation, but both situations saw a sharp disparity in upper rank distribution, as both had, and to a lesser extent, still have a disproportionately low level of upper ranked minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= Young, Warren |year=1982 | title=Minorities and the military |publisher=Greenwood Press | location =Connecticut |isbn= 0-313-22900-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in the military===
{{Main|Women in the military}}
Military and gender issues is a diverse and plural field within military sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Fasting, Kari and Trond Svela Sand eds., (2010). "Gender and Military Issues - A Categorized Research Bibliography." ''Moving Soldiers - Soldaten i bevegelse'' 01/2010. {{ISSN|1891-8751}}. [http://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/99263/01%20Gender%20and%20Military.pdf?sequence=1]&lt;/ref&gt; The roles of women can include being the transmitter of cultural values to children, reproducers of boundaries and active militants in national struggles. Women have served in the military throughout history. Women's military recruitment rejects the idea that 'women should be protected'. Recruitment is very important in Latin America, Israel, Nicaragua, Rwanda and Northern Ireland. In Turkey, the wife of the chief commander represents the mother of the military family. Some states in the developing world are [[egalitarian]] and many women are recruited into the military to achieve the modern ideal. With women's customary role as a nurturer and mother, the increased equality and inclusion of women in the military could change the reason for war or [[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]] of wars.&lt;ref&gt;Toktas, Sule.

[[Sexual assault in the United States military]] is an issue for military women. The 2012 Pentagon survey found approximately 26,000 women and men were sexually assaulted. Of those, only 3,374 cases were reported. In 2013, a new Pentagon report found that 5,061 troops reported cases of assault. Many people are optimistic that this 50% increase in reports is indicative of victims "growing more comfortable in the system." Of these reported, however, only 484 cases went to trial, and only 376 resulted in convictions.

During [[World War II]] women served in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corp (WAAC) which was later renamed [[Women's Army Corps]] (WAC). In addition, there was [[WAVES]], or Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Services.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

[[Jane Addams]] and [[Cynthia Enloe]] have been identified as women who have contributed key ideas to military sociology &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.routledge.com/Sociology-and-Military-Studies-Classical-and-Current-Foundations/Soeters/p/book/9781138739536] Soeters, Joseph. 2018. Sociology and Military Studies: Classical and Current Foundations. New York, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;. Addams's influence stems from her feminist perspectives on peace and its influence on peacekeeping&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319506449 Shields, Patricia]. 2017.

Ralston] (Ed.), ''A Bold New World: Essays on Philosophical Pragmatism and International Relations'' (pp. 87–110). New York: Lexington Books. &lt;/ref&gt;. Enloe's influence is traced to her feminist view of the military.

===Homosexuality and the military===
{{Main|Homosexuality in the military}}
[[Homosexual]]s were not recruited into the U.S. military from [[World War II]] to the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] presidency. In 1993, the Clinton administration began the policy of "[[Don't ask, don't tell|Don't ask, Don't tell, Don't pursue]]", meaning that military personnel will be neither compelled ("Don't ask") nor allowed ("Don't tell") nor harassed ("Don't pursue") to disclose or discuss their [[sexual identity]] while serving in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= Yoshino, Kenji |year=2006 | title=Covering: The Hidden Assault on Our Civil Rights |publisher=Random House | location =New York |isbn= 0-375-50820-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Don't ask, Don't tell, Don't pursue" policy actually had the effect of increasing discharges due to homosexuality from 617 in 1994 to 1,273 in
2001.&lt;ref&gt;Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, “Conduct Unbecoming: The Tenth Annual Report on ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, Don’t Pursue, Don’t Harass,’” (March 24, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates have been made that in 2000 there were 1 million gay and lesbian veterans in the U.S. population as based on census information.&lt;ref&gt;Gary J. Gates, Gay Men and Lesbians in the U.S. Military: Estimates From Census 2000 (Washington, DC: Urban Institute Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexual women with partners reported higher rates of military service than other women, while homosexual male veterans served for a similar amount of time as heterosexual male veterans.&lt;ref name=primary&gt;David R. Segal and Mady Wechsler Segal (2004) "America’s Military Population" Population Bulletin Vol. 59, No.4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military Science===
Recently there has been interest in how the modern militaries have constructed their knowledge.  Military science in modern armed forces has taken on the aura of a hard science when it is arguably a combination of hard science, sociology ("soft science"), and military history (the humanities).  Postmodern deconstructions of the assumptions behind modern military science can be effective in revealing how modern militaries have socially constructed their reality.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Paparone (2013), ''The Sociology of Military Science,'' NY: Bloomsbury.  Also, Chris Paparone (2017) "How we fight: A critical exploration of US military doctrine." Organization 24, no. 4: 516-533. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Military and society==

===Political control of the military===
In the modern relationship between the military and the state, the state relies on the military to protect it from external threats as well as violence between various internal groups. Concurrently, the military draws so-called 'violent resources' from the state and from society. Such resources can include money, technology, raw materials, and manpower. The relationship has changed somewhat from the 16th and 17th centuries, however, where internal centers of power and specific sectors of society (e.g., skilled builders or [[guild]]s) were somewhat more autonomous than the rest. These sectors were not under the direct control of the sovereign power and could avoid feeding resources to the state. This meant that pre-modern militaries were 1) somewhat weaker than the modern version due to a lack of state-funded resources but also 2) powerful sectors of society that controlled certain privately funded resources and which could raise their own mercenary forces if needed.
As this system began to evolve, states started to exert more control over society by exploiting 'existential fears' which led to the creation of various [[bureaucratic]] methods including mass conscription, [[tax system]]s, and territorial centralization. The result is that various civil sectors began to work exclusively for the state, which in turn desired a stronger military, and which used these sectors to extract more resources and more manpower for exclusive military use. This 'modern' military now was reliant on the state for its very existence, whereas, in pre-modern times, the military could be the tool of various autonomous sectors of society.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Yagil. &lt;nowiki&gt;"&lt;/nowiki&gt;Controlling the Invisible: The Deficient Political Control of the Modern Military&lt;nowiki&gt;"&lt;/nowiki&gt;. ''Center for Studies of Social Change''(1995). Columbia International Affairs Online. Pittsburgh University Lib., Pittsburgh, PA. 14 July 2008.[http://www.ciaonet.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military's use of research and industry===
Burkard Schmitt a Research Fellow for the [[European Union Institute for Security Studies|EU Institute for Security Studies]] identifies two types of research. [[Pure research]] is done from the bottom-up with no specific demand and are long term oriented. Capability research is done from the top down, most research of this type is defined for mostly military use with a specific goal in mind.&lt;ref name=security&gt;Schmitt, Burkard. The European Union and Armaments: Getting a bigger bang for the Euro. ''Institute for Security Studies, August 2003.'' [http://www.iss.europa.eu/uploads/media/cp063e.pdf www.iss-eu.org]. 23 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Europe
Few European countries have had significant investments in research and technology. National sensitivities and defense companies that are hesitant to share research findings has long hindered research in Europe. This is beginning to change with the formation and strengthening of the [[European Union|EU]] and the [[Common Security and Defence Policy]] (CSDP). The EU is currently implementing its "Agenda for advanced research relating to global security" which is crucial to the future of European security. The idea in Europe is that research should be undertaken by all member states. A goal for member states and something to aid future research is a "harmonization" of military requirements.&lt;ref name=security/&gt;
;United States
The American model for research is based on the old German standard, which the Americans emulated starting from the founding of the [[American Chemical Society]] in 1876. The use of research and industry to develop new and more deadly [[chemical weapon|chemical]] and [[biological weapon]]s is an intriguing aspect of the modern military. German universities were involved in early chemical gas development for use in World War I. German universities "carefully cultivated the ideal of science as an emphatically value-free activity; they bestowed upon their wards the right and the duty to serve the interests of knowledge and to brush aside other interests with which the welfare of scientific pursuits might clash." American universities also had chemical labs, [[Harvard University]] began work on [[poison gas]] in 1917. By World War I, the chemical industry began to influence politics because of the great interdependence between industry, military and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Zygmunt, Bauman (2000). ''Modernity and the Holocaust.'' New York: Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of research that is done relates to the U.S. economy, which includes [[Military budget of the United States|the largest military budget in the world]]. This has created a strong link between military, the state, and corporate America. This has been called the "[[military industrial complex]]", but the military has also dominated large university science departments. This concept is the military industrial academic complex, or MIA.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, C. Wright(1956). ''The Power Elite.'' New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ouled Naïl''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|uː|l|ɛ|d|_|ˈ|n|aɪ|l}}; {{lang-ar|أولاد نايل}}) are a tribe and a tribal confederation living in the [[Ouled Naïl Range]], [[Algeria]]. They are found mainly in [[Bou Saâda]], [[M'Sila]] and [[Djelfa]], but there is also a significant number of them in [[Ghardaïa Province]], beyond their ancestral region.

==Origins==
The [[oral lore]] of the Ouled Naïl people claims ancient [[Arab]] descent from tribes that arrived in the area about a thousand years ago. Some traditions trace their ancestry to the [[Banu Hilal]] of [[Hejaz]], who came to the highlands through [[El Oued]], [[Ghardaia]],&lt;ref&gt;Nouvelle géographie universelle: la terre et les hommes, Volume 11 Par [[Elisée Reclus]] (1830-1905), p.552&lt;/ref&gt; while others claim that they are direct descendants of [[Idris I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vc0OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA329&amp;dq=Ouled+Na%C3%AFl+Idris&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=tbamTKPXK4H_8Aab0oT_AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Revue africaine|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Traditional lifestyle==
[[File:Wled Nayel Dress.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional women dress of the interior side of Algeria]]

The Ouled Naïl are seminomadic or [[nomadic]] people living in the highlands of the range of the [[Saharan Atlas]] to which they gave their name. The town of [[Djelfa]] has been traditionally an important market and trade centre for the Ouled Naïl, especially for their cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algeria.com/blog/a-different-perspective-of-algeria|title=A Different Perspective of Algeria -  English blog - By Algeria Channel|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town has cold and long winters with temperatures averaging 4&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Sah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alger-roi.fr/Alger/titteri/textes/6_titteri_atlas_saharien.htm|title=geographie de l'afrique du nord,le titteri des francais,atlas saharien;alger-roi.fr|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years [[Djelfa Province]] has become one of the most populated provinces of Algeria with a population of 1,164,870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azititou.wordpress.com/2013/04/02/djelfa-une-wilaya-steppique-en-pleine-mutation/|title=Djelfa : Une wilaya steppique en pleine mutation.|work=L'ALGERIE, SES COUTUMES, SA CULTURE, ET SES TRADITIONS.|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ouled Naïl have traditionally reared cattle as nomads in their mountain grasslands, as well in the northern [[Hodna]] region and the Dayas in the south. When they are nomadic they live in black-and-red striped tents, but they also used to live in ''dechra'', or non fortified villages, or in [[ksar|ksour]], fortified ones. Cereal cultivation is possible in the mountain heights, although with rather irregular results. They rarely were able to cultivate [[date palm]]s in the heights but obtained dates from other areas by trading, especially in [[Bou Saâda]] located at the feet of the northern end of the mountain range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alger-roi.fr/Alger/documents_algeriens/monographies/pages/20_pays_ouled_nail.htm|title=le pays des ouled-nail,algerie,documents algeriens,venis;alger-roi.fr|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the harsh conditions of the dry and cold highlands where they live, this ethnic group has managed to fare fairly well in their traditional environment along the centuries. However, the odd years of [[drought]] and years with prolonged, cold winters are disastrous for the Ouled Nail; in 1944, and again in 1947, when weather conditions were especially rough, about 50% of their livestock died and [[famine]]s followed.&lt;ref name="Sah"/&gt;

===Dances and songs===
The Ouled Naïl tribe originated a style of music, sometimes known as [[Bou Saâda]] music after the town near their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yvHRckOz5g|title=YouTube|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[belly dancing]], the term refers to a style of dance originated by the Ouled Naïl, noted for their way of dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belly-dance.org/ouled-nail.html |title=Ouled Nail |publisher=Belly-dance.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jasminjahal.com/articles/99_06.html |title="The Ouled Nail of Algeria", by Jasmin Jahal, June 1999 |publisher=Jasminjahal.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although their primary roles and activities in their rural milieu were connected with animal farming, most women trained in the art of dance and song from childhood. Thus for Ouled Naïl females the practice of leaving their ancestral home and settling in a nearby desert town as entertainers was common. This was especially so in times of disaster and famine, when a woman had relative freedom to fend for herself in order to survive, save money and improve her future economic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thewordcollector2.tumblr.com/post/30441674149/enshrouded-by-mystery-tribes-of-algeria-part-2|title=Enshrouded by Mystery- Tribes of Algeria (Part 2)|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gildedserpent.com/cms/2009/08/16/andreadanc4dowries2/#axzz3B5IGI59r|title=Gilded Serpent, Belly Dance News &amp; Events , » Dancing for Dowries, Part 2:|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Exotic" representations==

The 1956 edition of the [[Michelin Guide]] devotes only a few lines to the Ouled Naïl mountain region; Djelfa is not even mentioned and the Ouled Naïl people are "mere [[courtesan]]s and [[Oriental dance]]rs".&lt;ref name="Sah"/&gt; 
French colonialist representations of the Ouled Naïl concentrated almost exclusively on women who temporarily left their home and settled in some nearby town.&lt;ref&gt;Marnia Lazreg, ''The Eloquence of Silence: Algerian Women in Question''. p. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of the highland tribes to which they belonged were specialised in prostitution&lt;ref name="musee"/&gt; and only some Ouled Naïl women became dancers. Still, the exuberance of their ornaments and the exoticism of their costumes added to the general fascination.&lt;ref name="musee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museehistoirevivante.com/expovirtuelle/Algerie/ImgAlg/Chapitre3/FemmesAlg/popOuled14.htm |title=Algérie 1830-1962 - le musée de l'Histoire vivante |publisher=Museehistoirevivante.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Auguste Maure]], an orientalist photographer that lived in [[Biskra]] was active from 1860 to 1907 and took many photographs of landscapes and cities of south Algeria ([[El Kantara]], [[Sidi Okba]], [[Chetma]], [[Tilatou]], [[Tolga, Algeria|Tolga]], [[Touggourt]]). The female members of the Ouled Naïl tribe, wearing the traditional colorful costumes and covered by jewels, were often represented on Maure photographs which were appreciated by tourists.

'''Pardes Hanna Agricultural High School''' ({{lang-he|בית הספר התיכון החקלאי פרדס חנה}}) established in 1935 by the Palestine Farmers Association, is one of the oldest [[Agricultural education|agricultural high schools]] in [[Israel]]. It was the first agricultural high school in Israel that allowed students to prepare for [[matriculation]] exams, while similar schools in the country concentrated only on teaching agricultural skills, with very little general education.
[[File:Haklai-a-c1.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The 7-9 grades building at the Pardes Hanna Agricultural High School]]
[[File:Pardes Hanna Ag School morning milking.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Morning milking at the school's dairy farm]]
The school was established originally for the children of farmers from [[Pardes Hanna-Karkur]] and the vicinity, but soon it attracted students from farming families all over Israel. The school also operated a [[boarding school]] on the grounds.

In 2003 the school had 1,647 students in grades 7-12 and employed 160 teachers. The school's yard was among the largest yards of any school in Israel and includes a commercial egg laying [[chicken coop]], a [[Dairy farming|dairy farm]], a [[Nursery (horticulture)|nursery]], and a horse [[stable]]. The school also owns large [[citrus]] and [[Avocado]] orchards that allow students to conduct studies in fruit production. All the work in the different agricultural fields is conducted by the students, under the guidance of professional guides, and it is a part of every students course of studies at the school. All students must take one matriculation exam in an agricultural field of study. Until the end of the 20th century all student had the opportunity of getting a [[tractor]] [[driver's licence]] as part of their studies, a program that was stopped due to budget cuts.

After a long budget crisis, bringing to the closing of the boarding school and reduction of much of the agricultural educational activities, in 2010 the school was transferred to the administration of the [[Branco Weiss]] schools network.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brancoweiss.org.il&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the school's graduates are [[Moti Kirschenbaum]], [[Avraham Katz-Oz]] the former Agricultural Minister, [[Elazar Granot]], and General [[Aharon Yariv]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4471">The sociologist [[Max Weber]] formulated a [[three-component theory of stratification]] in which he defined '''party class''' as a group of people (part of a society) that can be differentiated on the basis of their [[Political party|affiliations with other engaged members in the political domain]].

==Summary==

Unlike [[communities]], where problems arise and are solved by those within the group, [[parties]] are formed when individuals seek out support beyond their immediate spatial environment. Status groups such as communities, or groups of individuals in similar class situations, become parties only when their means of mobilizing and assembling in pursuit of power becomes structured. A teachers' union is one example of a party drawn from a collective communal body. While the party does not necessarily represent the will of each individual member, it forms on the basis of rational collective interests and the assignment of outside individuals to protect those interests.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max (1967). "Class, Status, Party". ''From Max Weber'', 180–195.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, when taxpayers in a geographic region mobilize to vote against support for allocation of resources to local schools, the teachers' union may enter the political realm to protect the interests of its members. These pursuits are thought{{By whom|date=August 2016}} to be rational in that they only represent the demands of the members insofar as they relate to the reason for that party's congregation. While all members of the same union may support protection of local wildlife, those interests would be pursued via a separate party.

Unlike power formed on the basis of [[wealth]] or [[Social status|status]], parties tend to most successfully aggregate and mobilize when their members represent a range of environments and social statuses. While a party's objective may ultimately be the protection of financial capital or the status of its members, parties initially form to represent a range of group interests. A party's political program represents both the key issues that party members decide on once congregated, and pull issues aimed at attracting members who share detached but similar interests.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max (1967)."Politics as a Vocation". ''From Max Weber'', 77–128.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the [[nonprofit]] [[Habitat for Humanity]] may use political leverage to obtain funding from the local government, but the homebuilding it provides in low-income neighborhoods draws grassroots support for the organization's efforts. While parties always seek to maintain political leverage, the local environment provides the human capital with which to mobilize those demands.

According to Weber, parties can form in unintended directions and pursue ends that are not initially part of their intended purpose. In ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'', Weber argued that the [[Protestant]] religion, initially formed as a spiritual institution, became the ethic that underlay the transition into capitalism. The initial pro-capitalist political parties that formed in Europe reflected the desire to prove success in spiritual life via the accumulation of capital, which became the pinnacle of “worldly calling”. As he argued of rationality in general, parties become the formally sanctioned, bureaucratic extension of emotional authority as society transitions into modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max (2003). ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''&lt;/ref&gt; Parties form primarily in democratic societies because of the ideological differences that can arise between individuals in the same geographic region.

==Issues with party power==

As more contemporary theorists have noted, parties tend to become overburdened with demands as they grow larger and lose focus on initial key issues. One example, pursued by Doug McAdams in his writing Political Process and the Development of Black Insurgency, was the Civil Rights Movement. Although the movement initially succeeded and made enormous social and political impact due to its rational and centered goals, the movement began to weaken throughout the 1970s due in part to irreconcilable views touted by its various leaders and sects.&lt;ref&gt;McAdams, Doug. 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7751">{{Economic systems sidebar|coordination}}
In [[economics]], a '''price system''' is a component of any [[economic]] system that uses [[prices]] expressed in any form of [[money]] for the [[Economic value|valuation]] and distribution of goods and services and the [[factors of production]]. Except for possible remote and primitive communities, all modern societies use price systems to allocate resources, although price systems are not used exclusively for all resource allocation decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/475822/price-system | title = Price system | author = [[George J. Stigler]], [[William J. Baumol]] | work = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | accessdate =2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A price system may be either a [[regulated market|fixed price system]] where [[Administered price|prices are administered]] by a government body, or it may be a [[free price system]] where prices are left to float "freely" as determined by supply and demand uninhibited by regulations. A mixed price system involves a combination of both administered and unregulated prices.

== History ==
Price systems have been around as long as there has been [[money]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} 

The price system has evolved into the system of global [[capitalism]] that is present in the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110728152736/http://www.technocracy.org/archives/185-langan I Am The Price System R. B. Langan Great lakes Technocrat  April 1944, # 66.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union and other [[Communist state]]s with a centralized [[planned economy]] maintained controlled price systems. Whether the ruble or the dollar is used in the economic system, the criterion of a price system is the use of money as an arbiter and usual final arbiter of whether a thing is done or not. In other words, few things are done without consideration for the monetary costs and the potential making of a profit in a price system.

=== Debate on socialism ===
{{See also|Socialist calculation debate}}
The American economist [[Thorstein Veblen]] wrote a seminal tract on the development of the term as discussed in this article: ''The Engineers and the Price System''.&lt;ref&gt;Harbinger Edition, 1963. LCCCN 63-19639. First Published as a series of essays in [[The Dial]] (1919) then as a book in 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/Theorists/Veblen/Papers/Engineers.htm Full Text (HTML)]&lt;/ref&gt; Its chapter VI, ''A Memorandum on a Practicable Soviet of Technicians'' discusses the possibility of [[socialist]] revolution in the United States comparable to that then occurring in Russia (the Soviets had not yet at that time become a state (USSR formed in 1922)).

The original conception of socialism involved the substitution of money as a unit of calculation and monetary prices as a whole with [[calculation in kind]] (or valuation based on natural units), with business and financial decisions replaced by engineering and technical criteria for managing the economy. Fundamentally, this meant that socialism would operate under different economic dynamics than those of capitalism and the price system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bockman|first= Johanna |title= Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism|publisher= Stanford University Press|year= 2011|month= |isbn= 978-0-8047-7566-3|page = 20|quote= According to nineteenth-century socialist views, socialism would function without capitalist economic categories - such as money, prices, interest, profits and rent - and thus would function according to laws other than those described by current economic science. While some socialists recognized the need for money and prices at least during the transition from capitalism to socialism, socialists more commonly believed that the socialist economy would soon administratively mobilize the economy in physical units without the use of prices or money.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1930s, the economists [[Oskar Lange]] and [[Abba Lerner]] developed a comprehensive model of a socialist economy that utilized a price system and money for the allocation of [[capital good]]s. In contrast to a free-market price system, "socialist" prices would be set by a planning board to equal the [[marginal cost]] of production to achieve [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] Pareto efficiency. Because this model of socialism relied upon money and administered prices as opposed to non-monetary calculation in physical magnitudes, it was labelled "market socialism". In effect, Oskar Lange conceded that calculations in a socialist system would have to be performed in value terms with a functioning price system rather than using purely natural or engineering criteria as in the classic concept of socialism.&lt;ref name="Revisiting the Socialist Calculation Debate"&gt;''Revisiting the Socialist Calculation Debate: The role of markets and finance in Hayek's response to Lange's challenge'', by Auerbach, Paul and Sotiropoulos, Dimitris. 2012. Kingston University London, Economics Discussion Paper 2012-6, pp. 1-2: "He readily acceded to the need for efficiency calculations to be made in value terms rather than using purely natural or engineering criteria, but claimed that these values could emerge along lines consistent with neoclassical value theory, without the need for a market in capital goods and without private ownership over the means of production."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hayek===
{{details|Price signal}}
[[Austrian School]] economist [[Friedrich Hayek]] argued that a free price system allowed economic coordination via the [[price signal]]s that changing prices send, which is regarded as one of his most significant and influential contributions to economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Skarbek | first = David | title = F. A. Hayek's Influence on Nobel Prize Winners | journal = [[Review of Austrian Economics]] | volume = 22 | number = 1 | date = March 2009 | url = http://www.davidskarbek.com/papers/HayekNobel.pdf }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[The Use of Knowledge in Society]]" (1945), Hayek wrote, "The price system is just one of those formations which man has learned to use (though he is still very far from having learned to make the best use of it) after he had stumbled upon it without understanding it. Through it not only a [[division of labor]] but also a coördinated utilization of resources based on an equally divided knowledge has become possible. The people who like to deride any suggestion that this may be so usually distort the argument by insinuating that it asserts that by some miracle just that sort of system has spontaneously grown up which is best suited to modern civilization. It is the other way round: man has been able to develop that division of labor on which our civilization is based because he happened to stumble upon a method which made it possible. Had he not done so, he might still have developed some other, altogether different, type of civilization, something like the "state" of the termite ants, or some other altogether unimaginable type."&lt;ref name="Hayek45"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.kysq.org/docs/Hayek_45.pdf |author=[[Friedrich Hayek]] |title=The Use of Knowledge in Society |date=September 1945 |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=35 |number=4 |page=528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9730">'''Puukkojunkkari''' (or ''häjy'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''knivjunkare'', translated to [[English language|English]] as '''knife-fighter'''&lt;ref&gt;Ylikangas, Heikki: ''Major fluctuations in crimes of violence in Finland - A historical analysis'', Scandinavian Journal of History, volume 1, issue 1-4 1976, pp. 81-103&lt;/ref&gt;; literal translation: "'''knife junker'''") was a term used of troublemakers who were active in the [[Southern Ostrobothnia]] region of [[Finland]] in the 19th century. Fights among puukkojunkkaris were common, and often resulted in [[homicide]]; one could even get stabbed at a [[funeral]]. Puukkojunkkaris usually made trouble at [[wedding]]s, stole [[horse]]s and circulated among towns and villages. They also participated in [[gambling]], [[Theft|thievery]] and courtship with women. The most notorious puukkojunkkaris lived in towns near the [[Lapuanjoki]] river, such as [[Alahärmä]]. The first homicides happened in the 1790s, but the famous "golden age" of puukkojunkkaris lasted from the 1820s to the 1880s.

==Puukkojunkkaris as social phenomenon==

Puukkojunkkaris were present in all society classes. They included both free houseowners and farm servants. The houseowners were often gang leaders. Puukkojunkkaris were often feared and respected, and fought for their honour. The code of [[honour]] disallowed fear and respected fighting. Puukkojunkkaris were often difficult to prosecute because few people dared testify against them. Puukkojunkkaris also received admiration and respect because they dared to stand up against society and authorities.	&lt;ref&gt;Paulaharju 1947, p. 284–305, Pietiläinen 1999, p. 303–316, Kallio 1982, p. 256-263, Kallio 2009, p. 9, 154–167,186. &lt;/ref&gt;

Many attempts have been made to explain the rise of puukkojunkkaris. In the 19th century, the living standard in Ostrobothnia rose, and because of this, weddings became grandiose events with lots of [[alcoholic beverage]]s. Young men in Ostrobothnia did not often get a chance to inherit their own farm in their home town and earn their own wealth, which led to frustration. &lt;ref&gt;Ylikangas 1976, p. 289-294.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of young men’s rebellion==

Reino Kallio’s theory of knife-fighters is based on the idea of a counter reaction caused by social control that has been taken too far. He sees youth’s violent behaviour as a protest-like rebellion against the pressure exercised by the power structure; particularly against local laws and parish discipline. The resistance that started as little more than slight mischief became branded as troublemakers and led to a path towards serious crimes. This was particularly due to the fact that parish discipline, which was stricter than general law, lowered the threshold of crime. At the time, there were many new ways of youngsters spending their free time, such as wandering around outdoors at night, which was considered a breach against the curfew and a threat to the existence of class society. Therefore, district courts started punishing people for curfew at night – as well as for other breakages against parish discipline. &lt;ref&gt;Kallio 1982, p. 234-239, Rajala 2004, p. 28-29, Kallio 2009, p. 154-156.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamentalist church and religious revivalist movements in the 18th and 19th centuries, such as pietism, also had a negative view towards young people’s leisure activities due to moral reasons. This led to competition between different religious groups, first leading to tighter church discipline and then to parish discipline. The situation was brought to a head by the labour shortage due to tar and peatland burning cultivation that brought more tension to the working conditions, while the rich, house-owning population competed with each other, building baronial, 1.5 to 2 storeys high residential buildings. By invoking general regulations, masters could avoid disciplinary conflicts with their children or hirelings when there was labour shortage. Furthermore, increased drinking caused both problems to families and conflicts inside communities.

The disciplinary regulations that were normally confirmed by the governor limited and regulated in detail the already scarce free time that youngsters had: in addition to curfew at night, the celebration of dances, the publication of the banns of marriage and weddings, gatecrashing, moving, gathering, the use of spirits, cardplaying as well as general noisemaking and loitering. Because the young age groups usually took care of the heaviest physical work, conditional fines were introduced in the 19th century to prevent days off. In Lapua, Laihia and Mustasaari, not only hirelings, but also house-owners and crofters were banned from having free days.

At worst, parish discipline even led to group criminalisation of young people, as was the case in Kauhava and Vähäkyrö in the 1770s and 1780s, in Vöyri in the 1820s and 1830s, and in the greater parishes of Laihia and Lapua a couple of decades later. Parish discipline was implemented as group punishments, and they were only taken to court in certain parishes in southern Ostrobothnia, not elsewhere in Finland – except for a few possible exceptions. All in all, troublemaking was based on the background of a long-term crisis caused by a radical socio-economic change, which triggered youth violence due to the parish discipline managed and maintained by authorities. Finally, the emerged culture of violence also started feeding itself.

The model that Mr. Kallio used for the first time in his thesis in 1982 has also been called the youth rebellion theory. Its main sources include court minutes and document material from local archives. The theory approaches the stigmatisation theory that the internationally known sociologist, Mr. [[Anthony Giddens]], considers to be one of the most important criminal theories. According to this theory, criminal behaviour is not a characteristic of an individual or a group, but rather an interactive process between criminals and non-criminals. The theory is based on the concept that no deed is criminal in itself, but the definition of crime constitutes a part of the exercise of power. An individual stigmatised as criminal is discriminated by authorities, which supports criminal behaviour and displacement from the mainstream population. A similar view can indirectly also be seen in the drama Pohjalaisia (Ostrobothnians).

==Execution of parish laws and regulations==

In the central parishes of both Finnish and Swedish-speaking southern Ostrobothnia, those who defended parish laws and regulations particularly directed their aims for power towards young working population, such as house-owners’, crofters’ and independent workers’ children, as well as soldiers and servants, who were in a socially subordinate position. Hundreds of them were fined for violations against parish discipline during the last three decades under the Swedish reign, so it was at the same time the first large-scale youth problem in the Finnish society that we know of.

On the local level, order was maintained by masters and, as trustees, mainly village aldermen and lay members of the courts, whose duty was to inform authorities of any violations against rules. Aldermen were sometimes even fined for neglecting their order maintaining duties. Many rural police chiefs also aimed at catching those guilty of violations against general order, and taking them to court. In the worst cases of public disorder, rural police chiefs had to call Russian armed forces, i.e. Cossacks, for help – one of them was even killed at a wedding in Lapua in 1862. Maintenance of order, and repetitive criminalisation after that, led to their displacement from the community. As a result, some of them considered themselves criminals, acted accordingly and even boasted of their criminal “heroic deeds”, which were sometimes also directed at rural police chiefs, priests and trustees. Santeri Alkio describes disturbances aimed at the last-mentioned group in his novel Puukkojunkkarit (Knife-fighters).

'''Reddiar''' (also spelt as '''Reddiyar)''' is a [[Telugu language|Telugu]] speaking caste title of farming and mercantile [[social group]] of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. 

Reddiars, [[Reddy]], Reddappa are considered and believed to come from the same origins and they spread across the lands of Southern and [[Central India]]. Political scientist [[Christophe Jaffrelot]] notes that, Reddiyars are the landlord caste originated from Telugu Country&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=tDN0MinxMigC&amp;pg=PA447&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Rise of the Plebeians?: The Changing Face of the Indian Legislative Assemblies|last=Jaffrelot|first=Christophe|last2=Kumar|first2=Sanjay|date=2012-05-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136516610|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said they are patrons/Financial supporters of local temples in Tamil Region. The origin of the Reddys (Reddiars) has been linked to the Rashtrakutas and till date the Reddys in India are spread across the same area of Rasthrakuta dynasty, although opinions vary. The names have been believed to be derived according to the regions they are spread across. Reddy ayyagaru(iygaru-Head) in AndhraPradesh and Telangana, Reddiar (Reddy+ar)in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Reddie, Reddappa (Reddy + appa- signifying respect) in Karnataka and Rayalaseema.

The Panta Reddiars, The Kanjam Reddiars, The Muduguveraya Reddiars moved from Andhra region in the search of rich black soil regions for cultivation and settled near Pondicherry. (In People of India/Indian Communities, Oxford University Press).

The Migration of the Reddys/Reddiars to areas of Chennai, Kanchipuram, Vellore and Northern Tamil Nadu is assumed to occur during the [[Reddy dynasty]] expansion till Kanchipuram areas.&lt;ref name="Pollock2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sheldon I.

==Origins==

Anavota Reddy (1335-1364 CE) of [[Reddy dynasty]] extended the dominion of the kingdom to Rajahmundry on the north, Kanchi on the south and Srisailam on the west. In a battle at Vallioor, Reddiapuram army defeated Travancore army in the 14th century.&lt;ref name="-page 94 History of Travancore from the earliest times"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shungoonny Menon|first=P|title=History of Travancore from the earliest times|year=1998|publisher=Asian Educational Services|location=Madras|isbn=9788120601697|pages=523|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxsrz7DAPxIC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an information Board at the entrance of the Vallioor Murugan Temple it is stated that 14th century vallioor War - Reddiapuram army defeated Travancore Army at vallioor Battle. After this war Reddiyars settled at Samugarengapuram, Seelathikulam and all over Tirunelveli Region in the 14th century.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

A mural at the Tiruppudaimaruthur temple in Tirunelveli district in Tamil Nadu, shows the emissaries of the Vijayanagara king Achyutadeva Raya serving an ultimatum to the Travancore ruler Bhoothala Veera Udaya Marthanda Varma to pay tributes to him and return the Pandya territory to Sri Vallabhan.

They have their origin in Vannipuranam.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

They migrated from Andhra Pradesh and Orissa to Tamil Nadu particularly to Madurai District at the period of Thirumalai Nayakkar rule.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Amongst the Tamil Sanjeeve Reddy diaspora==
[[File:Kondavid-drug. Signed 'W.R.'.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Water colour painting - Kondavidu fort, Reddy Kingdom.]]
Through emigration, there are now many Reddiars in the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] communities of United States, South Africa, Singapore, Australia, United Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}. The title does not generally mark the person as a Telugu but as an ethnic Tamil along with [[Naidu]] or Naidoo, [[Pillai (title)|Pillai]], [[Gounder]] and [[Chetty]] as surnames used in the [[Tamil diaspora]].

==Reddy versus Reddiars==

Though The Origin is thought tobe same with little arguments, Reddys predominantly speak Telugu and follow Telugu cultural festivals like [[Ugadi]] and follow all other Andhra norms. Whereas Reddiars who came to the Tamil region speak both Tamil for business and Telugu at home and identify and follow Telugu cultural norms.

'''Samuel Richard "Sandy" Berger''' (October 28, 1945&amp;nbsp;– December 2, 2015) was an American [[Political consulting|political consultant]] who served as the [[National Security Advisor (United States)|United States National Security Advisor]] for [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] from March 14, 1997, until January 20, 2001. Before that he served as the [[Deputy National Security Advisor (United States)|Deputy National Security Advisor]] for the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]] from January 20, 1993, until March 14, 1997.

==Early life==
Berger was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Millerton, New York]], where his parents ran an [[Surplus store|Army-Navy store]].&lt;ref&gt;edited by Louis Sandy Maisel, Ira N. Forman, Donald Altschiller, Charles Walker Bassett [https://books.google.com/books?id=7g1jaWlsY24C&amp;pg=PA309&amp;lpg=PA309&amp;dq=Sandy+Berger#v=onepage&amp;q=Sandy%20Berger&amp;f=false Jews in American Politics: Introduction by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman]; accessed March 31, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from Webutuck High School in 1963, earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[government]] from [[Cornell University]] in 1967, and his earned [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/June03/Berger.reunion.03.html Profile], Cornell.edu; accessed March 31, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/EOP/NSC/html/bergerbio.html Berger biography], clinton4.nara.gov; accessed March 31, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cornell.edu/stories/1996/12-26|title=Samuel R. Berger, Cornell University alumnus, is appointed national security adviser by President Bill Clinton|date=December 6, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At Cornell, Berger was a member of the [[Quill and Dagger]] society with [[Paul Wolfowitz]] and [[Stephen Hadley]]. Opposed to the [[Vietnam War]], Berger began working for [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[George McGovern]]'s presidential campaign in 1972. While there, he met [[Bill Clinton]], forming a friendship that lasted for decades. Berger later urged Clinton to run for President of the United States.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;Ahrens, Frank, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/iraq/keyplayers/berger022498.htm "The Reluctant Warrior"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', February 24, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the McGovern campaign, Berger gained experience working in a variety of government posts, including serving as Special Assistant to [[Mayor of New York City]] [[John Lindsay]] and Legislative Assistant to U.S. Senator [[Harold Hughes]] of [[Iowa]] and Congressman [[Joseph Resnick]] of [[New York (state)|New York]]. He was also Deputy [[Director of Policy Planning]] for the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] from 1977 to 1980 under [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Cyrus Vance]] during the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter administration]].&lt;ref name=stonebridgebio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stonebridge-international.com/bios/bio01.html |title=Web Page Under Construction |website=Stonebridge-international.com |date= |access-date=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the State Department, Berger went on to join the law firm [[Hogan &amp; Hartson]] where he helped expand the firm's [[international law]] practice. As a partner, he opened the firm's first two international offices, in [[London]] and [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; "Sandy Berger", [[Nancy Pelosi]] said in 1997, "was the point-man at&amp;nbsp;... Hogan &amp; Hartson&amp;nbsp;... for the trade office of the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]]. He was a lawyer-[[Lobbying|lobbyist]]."&lt;ref name=pelosi&gt;[[Nat Hentoff|Hentoff, Nat]], [http://users.aol.com/beachbt/genchi.txt "Dinner With Gen. Chi"], ''Washington Post'', January 26, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinton administration==

Clinton was in the [[Pentagon building|Pentagon]] to meet with the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and his national security team for a Gulf region update. Berger is seated to Cohen's left.]]
Berger served as Senior Foreign Policy Advisor to [[Governor of Arkansas|Governor]] Clinton during the campaign, and as Assistant Transition Director for National Security of the 1992 Clinton-Gore Transition. Berger served eight years on the National Security Council staff, first from 1993 - 1997 as [[Deputy National Security Advisor|deputy national security advisor]], under [[Anthony Lake]], whom Berger had recommended for the role, and then succeeding Lake as [[Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs]] from 1997 to 2001.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Berger was a central figure in formulating the [[foreign policy of the Clinton Administration]], and played an integral role advancing the administration's self-described objectives of advancing "democracy, shared prosperity, and peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clinton5.nara.gov/WH/Accomplishments/eightyears-10.html |title=The Clinton Presidency: A Foreign Policy for the Global Age |website=Clinton5.nara.gov |date= |access-date=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In President Clinton's words, "Nobody was more knowledgeable about policy or smarter about how to formulate it.  He was both great in analyzing a situation and figuring out what to do about it. His gifts proved invaluable time and time again, in Latin America, the Balkans, Northern Ireland, and the Middle East."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clintonfoundation.org/press-releases/statement-president-clinton-and-secretary-clinton-passing-sandy-berger |title=Statement from President Clinton and Secretary Clinton on the Passing of Sandy Berger |publisher=Clinton Foundation |date=2015-12-02 |access-date=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key achievements during Berger's NSC tenure included the 1995 peso recovery package in Mexico, [[NATO enlargement]], [[Operation Desert Fox]], the [[Dayton Accords]] that ended the killing in Bosnia, the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia]] that stopped the ethnic cleansing in [[Kosovo]], the [[Good Friday Agreement]] that helped bring about peace in Northern Ireland, and the administration's policy of engagement  with the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="timesbio"&gt;Apple Jr., R. W., [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70F15F8345C0C768EDDA10894D1494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fB%2fBerger%2c%20Samuel%20R%2e "A Domestic Sort With Global Worries"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 25, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In a March 2005 oral history interview at the [[Miller Center of Public Affairs|University of Virginia's Miller Center]], Berger noted, "I think during the '90s we took China from outside the international system and brought it inside the international system, partly through trade, and economics, and otherwise."&lt;ref name="Samuel R. Berger—Miller Center"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://millercenter.org/oralhistory/interview/samuel-r-berger|title=Samuel R. Berger—Miller Center|website=Millercenter.org|date=|access-date=2015-12-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222083243/http://millercenter.org/oralhistory/interview/samuel-r-berger|archivedate=December 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 4, 1999, in what South Asia expert Bruce Reidel called Berger's "finest hour,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bruce Riedel |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/12/02/farewell-sandy-berger-the-clinton-man-who-stopped-armageddon.html |title=Farewell, Sandy Berger, the Clinton Man Who Stopped Armageddon |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=1999-07-04 |access-date=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berger advised President Clinton through a pivotal negotiation with Pakistan's prime minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] to pull that country's troops back from [[Kashmir]], averting a potentially cataclysmic nuclear war with India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Raymond E Vickery, Jr|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/special/the-man-who-helped-end-the-kargil-war/20151215.htm|title=The Man Who Helped End The Kargil War|publisher=rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berger also advised the President regarding the Khobar Towers bombing and responses to the terrorist [[1998 United States embassy bombings|bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania]]. In the final years of the Clinton administration, combating terrorism was the paramount foreign policy priority; Berger said in his March 2005 oral history interview at UVA's Miller Center, "I said to [[Condoleezza Rice]] during the transition...that the number-one issue that she would deal with as national security advisor was terrorism in general and [[al-Qaeda]] specifically."&lt;ref name="Samuel R. Berger—Miller Center" /&gt;

===Controversies===

====Stock ownership====
In November 1997, Berger paid a $23,000 [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] penalty to settle [[conflict of interest]] allegations stemming from his failure to sell his [[stock]] of [[Amoco]] Corporation as ordered by the [[White House]]. Berger was advised by the White House to sell the stock in early 1994. He said he had planned to sell the stock, but then forgot. He denied knowingly participating in decisions in which he had a financial interest. With no evidence that Berger intended to break the law, the [[United States Department of Justice]] determined a civil penalty was adequate for a "non-willful violation" of the conflict of interest law.&lt;ref name=conflict&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/11/10/email/berger |title=AllPolitics - Berger Agrees To Pay Penalty - Nov. 10, 1997 |website=Cnn.com |date= |access-date=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chinese nuclear espionage====
[[Image:Clinton berger albright.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Sandy Berger with President Clinton and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Madeleine Albright]].]]
In 1999, Berger was criticized for failing to promptly inform President Clinton of his knowledge that the [[People's Republic of China]] had managed to acquire the designs of a number of U.S. [[nuclear warhead]]s. Berger was originally briefed of the [[espionage]] by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) in April 1996, but did not inform the president until July 1997.&lt;ref name=nukeespionage&gt;Gerth, Jeff and Risen, James, [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0B17F73E5C0C7A8CDDAD0894D1494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fB%2fBerger%2c%20Samuel%20R%2e "China Stole Nuclear Secrets From Los Alamos, U.S. Officials Say"], ''New York Times'', March 6, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Timeseditorial&gt;[http://taiwansecurity.org/News/NYT-990306.htm "The White House and China"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004858/http://taiwansecurity.org/News/NYT-990306.htm |date=September 27, 2007 }}, ''The New York Times'', April 9, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[Republican party (United States)|Republicans]], including then presidential hopeful [[Lamar Alexander]], called for Berger's resignation. They accused him of ignoring the allegations of Chinese espionage. "For his unwillingness to act on this serious matter, Mr. Berger should resign", Alexander said. "If he does not, he should be relieved of his duties by President Clinton."&lt;ref name="resign"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/US/9903/10/nuclear.secrets.02/ "Clinton's security adviser takes heat for China nuclear scandal"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218002357/http://www.cnn.com/US/9903/10/nuclear.secrets.02/ |date=December 18, 2007 }}, ''CNN''.com, March 11, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; President Clinton rejected the calls: "The record is that we acted aggressively," Clinton said. "Mr. Berger acted appropriately."&lt;ref name=rejectcalls&gt;Gerstenzang, James and Drogin, Bob, "Clinton Defends Response In China Espionage Case", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', March 12, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I asked DOE to widen and deepen its investigation, to intensify as they were planning their [[counterintelligence]] efforts to brief the [[United States Congress|Congress]]. Within several weeks the [[FBI]] had opened up a full investigation on the prime suspect. So I took the actions that I believe were appropriate. I get an awful lot of threat information every day. I have to make a judgment as to what I brief the president on and what I don't. In 1997, when this was clearly a pattern and a systemic problem, I thought it was essential for the president to know — Sandy Berger, May 29, 1999.&lt;ref name=bergertranscript&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/europe/jan-june99/berger_5-27.html Transcript], [[PBS NewsHour|NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]], ''PBS'', May 27, 1999; retrieved May 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Unauthorized removal and destruction of classified material====
[[Image:National Archives.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The National Archives building in [[Washington, D.C.]].]]
On July 19, 2004, it was revealed that the [[United States Department of Justice]] was investigating Berger for unauthorized removal of [[classified information|classified documents]] in October 2003 from a [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] reading room prior to testifying before the [[9/11 Commission]].  The documents were five classified copies of a single report commissioned from [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]] covering internal assessments of the Clinton Administration's handling of the unsuccessful [[2000 millennium attack plots]]. An associate of Berger said Berger took one copy in September 2003 and four copies in October 2003, allegedly by stuffing the documents into his socks and pants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith|first=Jeffrey|date=21 February 2007|title=Berger Case Still Roils Archives, Justice Dept.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/20/AR2007022001344.html|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|access-date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/LAW/04/01/berger.plea|work=CNN|title=Sandy Berger to plead guilty on documents charge|date=April 1, 2005|access-date=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berger subsequently lied to investigators when questioned about the removal of the documents.&lt;ref name=Turley&gt;[[Jonathan Turley|Turley, Jonathan]] (June 25, 2013) [https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/06/24/snowdens-russia-chase-reveals-double-standard-column-/2453817/ Snowden's Russia chase reveals double standard], ''[[USA Today]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2005, Berger pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material from the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=Turley1&gt;[[Jonathan Turley|Turley, Jonathan]] (June 25, 2013) [https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/06/24/snowdens-russia-chase-reveals-double-standard-column-/2453817 "Snowden's Russia chase reveals double standard"], ''[[USA Today]]''; accessed December 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berger was fined $50,000,&lt;ref name=bergerpleads1&gt;Sherman, Mark, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2005/04/01/national/w111624S64.DTL "Berger Pleads Guilty to Taking Materials"], ''[[Associated Press]]'' via SFGate.com, April 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; sentenced to serve two years of [[probation]] and 100 hours of community service, and stripped of his security clearance for three years.&lt;ref name=Turley /&gt;&lt;ref name=contradicts&gt;Margasak, Larry, [https://www.theguardian.com/uslatest/story/0,,-6334264,00.html "GOP Contradicts Justice Department"], ''[[Associated Press]]'', January 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The Justice Department initially said Berger only stole copies of classified documents and not originals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washtimes.com/national/20050909-122225-2387r.htm|title=Berger fined for taking papers|first=Jerry|last=Seper|publisher=[[The Washington Times]]|date=September 9, 2005|access-date=December 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the House Government Reform Committee later revealed that an unsupervised Berger had been given access to classified files of original, uncopied, uninventoried documents on terrorism. During the House Government Reform Committee hearings, Nancy Kegan Smith — who was the director of the presidential documents staff at the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] — acknowledged that she had granted Berger access to original materials in her office.&lt;ref&gt;R. Jeffrey Smith.

On December 20, 2006, Inspector General Paul Brachfeld reported that Berger took a break to go outside without an escort. "In total, during this visit, he removed four documents ... Mr. Berger said he placed the documents under a trailer in an accessible construction area outside Archives 1 (the main Archives building)". Berger acknowledged having later retrieved the documents from the construction area and returned with them to his office.&lt;ref name=theft1&gt;Lichtblau, Eric, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/21/washington/21berger.html "Report Details Archives Theft by Ex-Adviser"], ''New York Times'', December 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theft2&gt;Margasak, Larry, [http://apnews.myway.com/article/20061220/D8M4R7DO0.html "Report Says Berger Hid Archive Documents"], Apnews.myway.com, December 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 2007, Berger relinquished his license to practice law as a result of the Justice Department investigation. Saying, "I have decided to voluntarily relinquish my license. ... While I derived great satisfaction from years of practicing law, I have not done so for 15 years and do not envision returning to the profession. I am very sorry for what I did, and I deeply apologize." By giving up his license, Berger avoided cross-examination by the Bar Counsel regarding details of his thefts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20070516-113137-9942r.htm |title=Clinton aide forfeits law license in Justice probe |publisher=Washington Times |date= |access-date=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the Clinton Administration, Berger became chairman of [[Stonebridge International]], an international advisory firm he co-founded in 2001 which focused on aiding companies in their expansion into emerging markets such as [[Brazil]], China, [[India]], and [[Russia]].&lt;ref name=stonebridgebio /&gt; Stonebridge International merged in 2009 with The Albright Group, a similar firm founded by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, to form [[Albright Stonebridge Group]].

In late 2003, Berger was called to testify before the [[9/11 Commission]] regarding steps taken against [[terrorism]] during his tenure and the information he provided to his successor, Condoleezza Rice. At the time, Berger was also acting as an informal foreign policy advisor to Senator [[John Kerry]] during his campaign for the presidency. He quit his advisory role after controversy arose regarding his preparations for testifying before the September 11 committee.&lt;ref name=quitskerry&gt;{{cite web|last=Hancock |first=David |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/07/19/national/main630625.shtml |title=Sandy Berger Quits Kerry Team |publisher=CBS News |date=2004-07-19 |access-date=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''stoning of Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow''' was a public execution carried out by the [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] militant group on October 27, 2008 in the southern port town of [[Kismayo]], [[Somalia]]. Initial reports stated that the victim, Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow, was a 23-year-old woman found guilty of adultery. However, Duhulow's father and aunt stated that she was 13 years old, under the age of marriage eligibility, and that she was arrested and [[Stoning|stoned]] to death after trying to report that she had been raped. The execution took place in a public stadium attended by about 1,000 bystanders, several of whom attempted to intervene but were shot by the militants.&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7708169.stm|title=Stoning victim 'begged for mercy'|date=November 4, 2008|work=BBC News|accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AM"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/somalia-girl-stoned-was-child-13-20081031|title=Somalia: Girl stoned was a child of 13|date=October 31, 2008|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|accessdate=September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/rape-victim-stoned-dead-20081103-5h04.html|work=[[The Age]]|title=Rape victim stoned dead|date=November 4, 2008|accessdate=September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Amnesty International]], Al-Shabaab had formally charged Duhulow with adultery.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7708169.stm|publisher=''BBC News''|title=Stoning victim 'begged for mercy'|date=November 4, 2008|accessdate=September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1991, the government of then President of Somalia [[Siad Barre]] was overthrown by a coalition of armed factions.&lt;ref name="Fox News"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,445962,00.html|work=[[Fox News]]|title=Amnesty International Denounces Stoning Death of 13-Year-Old Somali Girl|date=November 2, 2008|accessdate=September 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Islamic Courts Union]] (ICU) took control of the southern half of Somalia in 2006, imposing [[Shari'a]] law.&lt;ref name="AJ"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2008/11/2008111201216476354.html|work=[[Al-Jazeerah]]|title=Somali fighters stone 'rape victim'|date=November 2, 2008|accessdate=September 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[Transitional Federal Government]] (TFG) assisted by Ethiopian troops re-captured the capital [[Mogadishu]], largely driving the ICU's leaders out of the country. [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]], the ICU's militant and youth branch, subsequently took up irregular warfare and [[guerrilla tactics]] against the allied forces.&lt;ref name="Fox News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AJ"/&gt; In 2008, the group was designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, which launched missile strikes against the militants early in the year.&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Freeman|first=Colin|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3407535/Somali-Taliban-behind-stoning-of-13-year-old-girl-gets-funding-from-Britain.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=Somali "Taliban" behind stoning of 13-year-old girl gets funding from Britain|date=November 8, 2008|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several thousand local civilians were killed by the militants during the height of the insurgency between December 2006 and October 2008. In the months leading up to Duhulow's execution, Al-Shabaab had been gaining strength, as it had seized control of the [[Port of Kismayo]], essentially shut down  Mogadishu's [[Aden Adde International Airport]], and dismantled pro-government roadblocks.&lt;ref name="Fox News"/&gt;

==Incident==
Duhulow and her family moved to the southern city of [[Kismayo]], Somalia from the Hagardeer refugee camp in [[Dadaab]], Kenya in July 2008.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/world/africa/05somalia.html?_r=0|title=Rape Victim Stoned to Death in Somalia Was 13, U.N. Says|date=November 4, 2008|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=139}} According to one of her teachers, Muno Mohamed Osman, who had taught Duhulow for a few months and did not remember her well, she struggled during class and "didn't look mentally fit[...] She was always in trouble with students, teachers[...] She was just a child."{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=139}} Three months after her arrival in Kismayo, Duhulow was reportedly raped by three armed men while travelling on foot to visit her grandmother in Mogadishu in October 2008.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;{{sfn|Benson and Stangroom|2012|p=173}} Her aunt took her to a police station to report the incident to the Al-Shabaab Islamist militia in Kismayo, which at the time controlled the city's court system. They were asked to return to the station a few days later, having been told that two suspects had been apprehended. Duhulow was subsequently arrested by the insurgents under charges that she had "chatted up" the men and committed adultery.{{sfn|Benson and Stangroom|2012|p=173}} She was then sentenced to death by stoning. The militant tribunal asserted that Duhulow had come to it with an admission of guilt, and that she was repeatedly asked to reconsider her confession but that she instead insisted that she wanted Sharia law and the attendant punishment to be applied.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; One militant, Sheik Hayakalah, stated that "the evidence came from her side and she officially confirmed her guilt[...] She told us that she was happy with the punishment under Islamic law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/girl-13-stoned-death-somalia-1-000-watch-charged-adultery-rape-article-1.337577|title=Girl, 13, stoned to death in Somalia as 1,000 watch; charged with adultery after rape|date=November 1, 2008|work=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; No attempts were made by the insurgent group to apprehend Duhulow's purported attackers.&lt;ref name="Howden"/&gt;

==Execution==
On October 27, 2008, during the afternoon, several militants transported Duhulow to a public stadium in Kismayo containing around 1,000 people.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Howden"&gt;{{cite web|last=Howden|first=Daniel|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/dont-kill-me-she-screamed-then-they-stoned-her-to-death-1003462.html|title='Don't kill me,' she screamed. Then they stoned her to death|date=November 9, 2008|work=[[The Independent Weekly|The Independent]]|accessdate=September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reportedly struggled with the insurgents and at one point screamed, "What do you want from me[...] I'm not going, I'm not going. Don't kill me."&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Four militants subsequently forced Duhulow into a dug out hole, burying her up to the neck.&lt;ref name="Howden"/&gt; Around 50 militants participated in the ensuing execution, throwing rocks at her head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pollitt|first=Katha|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124485147|title=The Nation: US Ranks 31 In The Global Gender Gap|date=March 9, 2010|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to witnesses, nurses were then instructed to verify whether Duhulow was still alive.&lt;ref name="Howden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGreal"/&gt; After ten minutes, she was dug out of the hole and two nurses confirmed that she was still alive, after which point Duhulow was put back in the hole and the stoning resumed. Although many witnesses to the event were too afraid of the armed militants to intervene, several bystanders attempted to save her. The insurgents responded by opening fire on them, in the process killing an eight-year-old boy.&lt;ref name="AM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Howden"/&gt; An Al-Shabaab spokesman later apologized for the child's death, and pledged that the shooter would be punished.&lt;ref name="AM"/&gt;

==Impact==
In December 2008, Nada Ali of [[Human Rights Watch]] (HWR) cited Duhulow as an example of females in the parts of south-central Somalia that were at the time under insurgent control who had little recourse to fair trials and health services. She stated, "Aisha's horrific death is likely to discourage rape victims from reporting rape or seeking justice from the Islamist insurgents." Ali also urged the [[United Nations Security Council]] to form an international investigative commission to inquire into the worst crimes reportedly committed against civilians during the conflict.&lt;ref name="Ali"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/12/09/and-what-about-somali-women|title=And what about Somali women?|date=December 9, 2008|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|accessdate=September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBC journalist Debi Goodwin wrote, "To the world, Aisha became a symbol of the dangers of extremism."{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=139}} On October 27, 2010, a "2nd Annual Memorial Lecture" was held by the Newcastle Amnesty Group to commemorate the second anniversary of Duhulow's death.{{sfn|Dickinson|2012|p=131}} That same year, Associate Professor Susanne Scholtz dedicated her book, ''Sacred Witness: Rape in the Hebrew Bible'' (2010), to her great-aunt, the rape victims in the Congo, and Duhulow, saying, "I honor Aisha and what she had to endure in her young life."{{sfn|Scholtz|2010|p=XII}}

==Responses==

===Al-Shabaab===
The Al-Shabaab militia prohibited journalists from taking pictures of the stoning, but allowed them to document the event.&lt;ref name="BBC2"/&gt; Militants initially reported that the stoning victim was a woman who had confessed to adultery. Witnesses and local journalists estimated her age at 23 based on her appearance.&lt;ref name="AM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGreal"&gt;{{cite web|last=McGreal|first=Chris|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/03/somalia-rape-amnesty|title=Somalian rape victim, 13, stoned to death|date=November 2, 2008|work=The Guardian|accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, [[Amnesty International]] reported that Duhulow's father had told them that she was only 13, under the age of marriage eligibility, and that she was arrested and executed after trying to report that she had been raped.&lt;ref name="BBC2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGreal"/&gt; Her aunt, who had taken her to the police to report the alleged assault, reiterated the father's statement regarding her age.{{sfn|Benson and Stangroom|2012|p=173}} A human rights activist in the area subsequently informed [[BBC News]] that he had received death threats from Al-Shabaab for allegedly disseminating false information on the incident. However, he denied any involvement with the Amnesty International press release.&lt;ref name="BBC2"/&gt;

===International organizations===
Notable reactions by international organizations immediately after the Duhulow incident included:
&lt;!-- N.B. Per [[WP:NOTDIRECTORY]], a few significant reactions only. --&gt;
*Amnesty International's Somalia Campaigner David Copeman said, "This was not justice, nor was it an execution. This child suffered a horrendous death at the behest of the armed opposition groups who currently control Kismayo. This killing is yet another human rights abuse committed by the combatants to the conflict in Somalia, and again demonstrates the importance of international action to investigate and document such abuses, through an International Commission of Inquiry."&lt;ref name="AM"/&gt;
*Christian Balslev-Olesen, [[UNICEF]] Representative for Somalia, said in response to the killing, "This is a tragic and deplorable incident. A child was victimized twice — first by the perpetrators of the rape and then by those responsible for administering justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=28809#.UiUWK2Xn_IU|title=Somalia: UNICEF speaks out against stoning death of 13-year-old rape victim|date=November 4, 2008|work=UN News Center|accessdate=September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNICEF also cited the incident as an example of the vulnerability that females in the conflict-stricken parts of Somalia were at the time faced with. The killing was the first public execution to take place in the country in two years.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=David|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1081214/Somali-girl-pleaded-mercy-Islamists-stoned-death-raped.html|title=Somali girl 'pleaded for mercy' before Islamists stoned her to death for being raped|date=November 5, 2008|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Radhika Coomaraswamy]], [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations]] and Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, said, "The incident highlights the extreme nature of violence against children and women in Somalia which has been heightened by the increasing lawlessness. It is the duty of the international community and the local authorities to stop these violations and to ensure better protection for children. No efforts should be spared."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/31612|title=Somali stoning victim was a mere child, not an adulterous woman|date=November 7, 2008|work=[[Afrol]]|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Global Campaign to Stop Killing and Stoning Women released a statement urging people to "write a letter to the representatives of Somalia, the African Union, and various UN human rights offices to encourage them to take action by investigating this murder, bringing the perpetrators to justice, and denouncing the actions of these insurgents".&lt;ref name="Rodriguez"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Julie|url=http://fnewsmagazine.com/2008/11/somali-rape-victim-stoned-disabled-women-face-greater-risk-of-abuse/|title=Somali Rape Victim Stoned, Disabled Women Face Greater Risk of Abuse|date=November 20, 2008|work=FNews Magazine|accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local reactions===
Mohamed Abdullahi, director of the Somali Community Initiative in the United Kingdom, said that many Somali immigrants in the UK had been sympathetic to Al-Shabaab in the previous years and had sent funds to it. He further said, "Over here in Britain, they are not seeing the violence that they are fuelling, or realising that al-Shabaab has some very hardline policies. Many people here were shocked to hear about the stoning incident, and said that it was not Islamic. In that case, they should think twice about sending money."&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;

The African newspaper ''Maghrebia'' reported that the incident drew outrage in the [[Maghreb]] region of Northwest Africa. Bassima Hakkaoui, a Moroccan Islamist Justice and Development Party MP, commented, "In principle, the state has laws which specify which party is supposed to give judgement, along with the nature of the crime. It defies logic to hand down a death sentence to a woman who has been raped." Islamic educationalist Hamid Baalla agreed, saying, "You cannot describe people who resort to such actions as Muslim. These people are radicals and extremists."&lt;ref name="Touahri"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Touahri|first1=Sarah|last2=Arfaoui|first2=Jamel|last3=Jameh|first3=Said|url=http://magharebia.com/en_GB/articles/awi/reportage/2008/11/07/reportage-01|title=Maghreb citizens outraged by stoning of raped Somali girl|date=November 7, 2008|work=Maghrebia|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was described as "inhumane, barbarous" by Moroccan Organization for Human Rights President Amina Bouayache and as "an act of terrorism towards the Somali people, particularly women" by women's rights activist Hind Mbarki.&lt;ref name="Touahri"/&gt;

The stoning was equally condemned in [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]], where head of the Mounia Association for the Protection of Single Women Zakia Gawaou described the situation as unacceptable.&lt;ref name="Touahri"/&gt; Muslim scholar Houssine Mohamed stated, "Adultery, in Aisha's case, was not voluntary. She was a victim of rape, as is the case of many young girls and women in Algeria who are raped by extremists. Therefore, sentencing her to death cannot be related to Islam."&lt;ref name="Touahri"/&gt; Khadija Cherif, President of the Tunisian Association of Democratic Women, said, "We condemn violence against women for whatever reason or purpose, especially violence that denies human beings of their right to live."&lt;ref name="Touahri"/&gt; Sofiene Ben Hmida, a member of the Tunisian League for the Defence of Human Rights, remarked, "This is an act committed by people who are living outside history. The danger doesn't lie with those people, but with those who just watch what they do without confronting them strongly and firmly."&lt;ref name="Touahri"/&gt; Iqbal Gharbi, professor of Sharia and Religious Principles at Zeitouna University, called the incident an "act of barbarism worthy of denunciation".&lt;ref name="Touahri"/&gt;

[[Image:Suburbia by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|300px|A suburban [[land use planning|land use]] pattern in the US]]

'''Suburbanization''' is a population shift from central [[urban area]]s into [[suburb]]s, resulting in the formation of [[urban sprawl|(sub)urban sprawl]]. Sub-urbanization is inversely related to [[urbanization]], which denotes a population shift from [[rural area]]s into urban centres.

Many residents of metropolitan regions work within the central urban area, and choose to live in satellite communities called [[suburb]]s and commute to work via automobile or mass transit.  Others have taken advantage of technological advances to work from their homes.  These processes often occur in more economically developed countries, especially in the [[United States]], which is believed to be the first country in which the majority of the population lives in the suburbs, rather than in the cities or in rural areas. Proponents of containing urban sprawl argue that sprawl leads to [[urban decay]] and a concentration of lower income residents in the [[inner city]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbanfutures.org/abstract.cfm?id=56 "Slow Growth and Urban Sprawl: Support for a New Regional Agenda?,"] Juliet F. Gainsborough, Urban Affairs Review, vol. 37, no. 5 (2002): 728-744.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

In the United States, suburbanization began to occur in mass amounts after World War II, when soldiers returned home from war and wanted to live in houses outside of the city. During this time America had a prosperous postwar economy, there was more leisure time available and an increased priority in creating a family unit. Throughout the years, the desire to separate work life and home life has increased, causing an increase in suburban populations. Suburbs are built for particular groups of people and around certain industries like restaurants, shopping, and entertainment which allows suburban residents to travel less and interact more in the suburban area. Suburbs in the United States have also evolved by increases in technology, which allows residents to work from home rather than commute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Suburbanization|editor-last=Benson|editor-first=Sonia|encyclopedia=UXL Encyclopedia of U.S History|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=1498–1501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent developments in communication technology, such as the spread of [[broadband]] services, the growth of [[e-mail]] and the advent of practical home [[video conferencing]], have enabled more people to work from home rather than commuting.  Although this can occur either in the city or in the suburbs, the effect is generally decentralizing, which works against the largest advantage of the centre city, which is easier access to information and supplies due to centralization.  Similarly, the rise of efficient package expresses delivery systems, such as [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], which take advantage of computerization and the availability of an efficient air transportation system, also eliminates some of the advantages that were once to be had from having a business located in the city. Industrial, warehousing, and factory land uses have also moved to suburban areas. Cheap telecommunications remove the need for company headquarters to be within quick [[courier]] distance of the warehouses and ports. Urban areas suffer from traffic congestion, which creates costs in extra driver costs for the company which can be reduced if they were in a suburban area near a highway. As with residential, lower property taxes and low land prices encourage selling industrial land for profitable [[brownfield]] redevelopment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[https://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/censr-4.pdf US Census Bureau (2002). ''Demographic Trends in the 20th Century'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Suburban areas also offer more land to use as a buffer between industrial and residential and retail space to avoid [[NIMBY]] sentiments and [[gentrification]] pressure from the local community when residential and retail is adjacent to industrial space in an urban area. Suburban municipalities can offer tax breaks, [[industrial park|specialized zoning]], and regulatory incentives to attract industrial land users to their area, such as [[City of Industry, California]]. The overall effect of these developments is that businesses as well, and not just individuals, now see an advantage to locating in the suburbs, where the cost of buying land, renting space, and running their operations, is cheaper than in the city. This continuing dispersal from a single city center has led to other recent phenomena in American suburbs, the advent of [[edge city|edge cities]] and [[exurbs]], arising out of clusters of office buildings built in suburban commercial centers on shopping malls and higher density developments.  With more and more jobs for suburbanites being located in these areas rather than in the main city core that the suburbs grew out of, traffic patterns, which for decades centered on people commuting into the center city to work in the morning and then returning home in the evening, have become more complex, with the volume of intra-suburban traffic increasing tremendously. By 2000, half of the US population lived in suburban areas.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Suburbanization in Eastern Europe==

In many countries of Europe, sometimes cities became seen as dangerous or very expensive areas to live, while the suburbs were seen as safe places to live and raise a family. There are periods of opposite developments like [[urbanization]].

During Communism, most socialist countries in the Eastern Bloc were characterized by under-urbanization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Murray | first1 = P. | last2 = Szelenyi | first2 = I. | year = 1984 | title = The city in the transition to socialism | url = | journal = International Journal of Urban and Regional Research | volume = 8 | issue = 10| pages = 90–107 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.1984.tb00415.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; which meant that industrial growth occurred well in advance of urban growth and was sustained by rural-urban commuting. City growth, residential mobility, land and housing development were under tight political control. Consequently, sub-urbanization in post-communist Europe is not only a recent but also a particular phenomenon. The creation of housing and land markets and state withdrawal from housing provision have led to the development of privatized modes of housing production and consumption, with an increasing role for private actors and, particularly, for households. Yet, the regulatory and institutional frameworks indispensable to a market-driven housing system – including housing finance – have remained underdeveloped, particularly in south-eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Tsenkova, S. (2009). Housing Policy Reforms in Post-Socialist Europe: Lost in Transition. Heidelberg: Physica-Verlag&lt;/ref&gt; This environment has undoubtedly stimulated housing self-provision.&lt;ref name="usj.sagepub.com"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Soaita | first1 = A.

[[File:Post-communist suburbanization in the Pitesti, Romania (2009).JPG|thumbnail|left|Post-communist suburbanization in Pitesti, Romania]]
Long-suppressed urbanization and a dramatic housing backlog resulted in extensive peri-urban growth in Tirana (Albania), which during the 1990s doubled the size of the city whereas war refugees put pressure on cities of former Yugoslavia. Elsewhere processes of suburbanization seemed dominant, but their pace differed according to housing shortages, available finance, preferences and the degree of 'permitted' informality. The process was slow in Prague during the 1990s and more apparent after 2000, when housing affordability improved. Conversely, Slovenian and Romanian suburban developments visibly surrounded cities/towns during the 1990s. Nonetheless, socialist legacies of underdeveloped infrastructure and the affordability crisis of transition differentiate post-socialist suburbs from their Western counterparts.&lt;ref name="usj.sagepub.com"/&gt;

Various degrees of informality characterized suburban housing from illegal occupation of public land ([[Tirana]]), [[illegal construction]] on agricultural private land ([[Belgrade]]) to the unauthorized but later legalized developments in [[Romania]]. Suburban housing displayed a chaotic/unplanned character, especially in south-eastern Europe, where the state retains a degree of illegitimacy. Excepting scattered for-profit housing, much of the new detached suburban houses seem self-developed. Allegedly, owner-building has become a household strategy to adapt to recession, high and volatile inflation, to cut construction costs and, finally, to bridge access to housing. The predominantly owner-built feature of most suburban housing, with the land often obtained at no cost through restitution policies or illegal occupation, allowed a mix of low-/middle-income households within these developments.&lt;ref name="usj.sagepub.com"/&gt;

==Tijuana==

Tijuana has experienced a strong wave of suburbanization from its urban core beginning in 2006.  Historically, Tijuana city, with 1/4 the area covering 80 square miles, contained well over 95% of the total population of the municipality, and it was the poor relegated to living outside the city.  Despite good highways, however, there was little incentive to move out of the city.  However, with a huge escalation of the [[Mexico drug war]] violence, middle class city residents and property developers along with retail chains began building suburban communities and sold them as a way to isolate themselves and their children from the negative effects.  This led to a historic movement to communities outside the urban core, as evidenced by both the type of middle class housing developments and 2010 INEGI census figures.

==Effects on psychological health==

Historically, it was believed that living in highly urban areas resulted in [[social isolation]], disorganization, and psychological problems, while living in the suburbs was supposed to be better to overall [[happiness]], due to lower population density, lower crime, and a more stable population.  A study based on data from 1974, however, found this not to be the case, finding that people living in the suburbs had neither greater satisfaction with their neighborhood nor greater satisfaction with the quality of their lives as compared to people living in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adams | first1 = Richard E. | year = 1992| title = Is happiness a home in the suburbs?: The influence of urban versus suburban neighborhoods on psychological health | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112409008/abstract | journal = Journal of Community Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 353–372 | doi=10.1002/1520-6629(199210)20:4&lt;353::aid-jcop2290200409&gt;3.0.co;2-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suburbanization and drug abuse ==
Pre-existing disparities in the demographic composition of suburbs pose problems in drug consumption and abuse. This is due to the disconnection created between drug addiction and the biased outward perception of suburban health and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/03/even-healthy-looking-suburbs-are-dying-from-drugs/521136/|title=The Suburbs That Are Sicker Than They Look|work=CityLab|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in drug mortality rates of suburban and urban spaces is sometimes fueled by the relationship between the general public, medical practitioners, and the pharmaceutical industry. These affluent individuals, who are living in the suburbs often have an increased means of obtaining otherwise expensive and potent drugs such as opioids and narcotics through valid prescriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sunrisehouse.com/research/rates-drug-use-urban-suburban-rural/|title=Rates of Drug Use: Urban, Suburban, &amp; Rural {{!}} Sunrise House|work=Sunrise House|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the combination of demographic and economic features created as a result of suburbanization has increased the risk of drug abuse in suburban communities. Heroin in suburban communities has increased in incidence as new heroin users in the United States are predominantly white, suburban men and women in their early twenties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/new-face-heroin-young-white-suburban-study-finds-n115671|title=New Face of Heroin Is Young, White and Suburban, Study Finds|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents and young adults are at an increased risk of drug abuse in suburban spaces due to the enclosed social and economic enclaves that surburbanization propagates. The ''New England Study of Suburban Youth'' found that the upper middle class suburban cohorts displayed an increased drug use when compared to the natural average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luthar|first=Suniya S.|last2=Small|first2=Phillip J.|last3=Ciciolla|first3=Lucia|date=February 2018|title=Adolescents from upper middle class communities: Substance misuse and addiction across early adulthood|journal=Development and Psychopathology|volume=30|issue=1|pages=315–335|doi=10.1017/S0954579417000645|issn=1469-2198|pmid=28558858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shift in demographics and economic statuses caused by suburbanization has increased the risk of drug abuse in affluent American communities and changed the approach to drug abuse public health initiatives. When addressing public health concerns of drug abuse with patients directly, suburban health care providers and medical practitioners have the advantage of treating a demographic of drug abuse patients that are better educated and equipped with resources to recover from addiction and overdose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170325/MAGAZINE/303259990|title=The increase in heroin users coming to the hospital reflects current trends in drug abuse.|work=Modern Healthcare|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disparity of treatment and initiatives between suburban and urban environments in regard to drug abuse and overdose is a public health concern. Although suburban healthcare providers may have more resources to address drug addiction, abuse, and overdose, preconceived ideas about suburban lifestyles may prevent them from giving proper treatment to patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170325/MAGAZINE/303259990|title=The increase in heroin users coming to the hospital reflects current trends in drug abuse.|work=Modern Healthcare|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the increasing incidence of drug abuse in suburban environments, the contextual factors that affect certain demographics must also be considered to better understand the prevalence of drug abuse in suburbs; for example, adolescents and their relationship with social groups in school and other socializing forces that occur as a result of suburbanization impact drug abuse incidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LUTHAR|first=SUNIYA S.|last2=D'AVANZO|first2=KAREN|date=1999|title=Contextual factors in substance use: A study of suburban and inner-city adolescents| journal=Development and psychopathology|volume=11|issue=4|pages=845–867 |pmc=3535189|pmid=10624729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic impacts==
The economic impacts of suburbanization have become very evident since the trend began in the 1950s. Changes in infrastructure, industry, [[real estate development]] costs, fiscal policies, and diversity of cities have been easily apparent, as "making it to the suburbs", mainly in order to own a home and escape the chaos of urban centers, have become the goals of many American citizens. These impacts have many benefits as well as side effects and are becoming increasingly important in the planning and revitalization of modern cities.

=== Impact on urban industry ===
[[File:Highway 401.png|thumbnail|Sprawling Freeway near Toronto, Canada with a suburbanized industry area in the background. Note the far distances from office buildings compared to a downtown. Many office buildings in suburban industry areas are set up on large irrigated campus, versus downtowns that have close buildings and very little greenery.]]

The days of industry dominating the urban cores of cities are diminishing as population [[decentralization]] of urban centers increases. Companies increasingly look to build industrial parks in less populated areas, largely for more modern buildings and ample parking, as well as to appease the popular desire to work in less congested areas. Government economic policies that provide incentives for companies to build new structures and lack of incentives to build on [[Brownfield land]] also contribute to the flight of industrial development from major cities to surrounding suburban areas. As suburban industrial development becomes increasingly more profitable, it becomes less financially attractive to build in high-density areas. Another impact of industry leaving the city is the reduction of [[buffer zone]]s separating metropolitan areas, industrial parks and surrounding suburban residential areas. As this land becomes more economically relevant, the value of such properties very often increases, causing many undeveloped landowners to sell their land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Opp|first1=Susan M.|last2=Herberle|first2=Lauren|title=Local Sustainable Urban Development in a Globalized World|date=June 28, 2008|publisher=Routledge|location=Florence, Kentucky|isbn=0754649946}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Soule|first=David|title=Urban Sprawl: A Comprehensive Reference Guide|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=London|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consequences on infrastructure ===

As America continues to sprawl, the cost of the required water lines, sewer lines, and roads could cost more than $21,000 per residential and non-residential development unit, costing the American government $1.12&amp;nbsp;trillion over the next twenty five years. Along with the costs of infrastructure, existing infrastructure suffers, as most of the government's money that is dedicated to improving infrastructure goes to paying for the new necessities in areas further out from the urban core. As a result, the government will often forgo maintenance on previously built infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sprawl Costs: Economic Impacts of Unchecked Development|year=2005|publisher=Island Press|pages=63|author1=Anthony Downs |author2=Barbara McCann |author3=Sahan Mukherji |author4=Robert Burchell }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact on real estate development costs ===
For residential properties, suburbanization allows for home prices to decrease, so people can drive until they can find an area in which they can afford to buy a home. However, these homes may lack certain things such as parks and access to public transit. Also, the prices of homes in downtown center usually decrease as well to compete with the inexpensive homes in the suburbs. One of the main benefits of living in the suburbs is that one gets a much larger piece of land than one would in the city. Therefore, as the size of lots increases, the supply of housing is more limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sprawl Costs: Economic Impacts of Unchecked Development|year=2005|publisher=Island Press|pages=71–72|author1=Anthony Downs |author2=Barbara McCann |author3=Sahan Mukherji |author4=Robert Burchell }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is to mean that as city growth patterns increase the population increases leading to suburbanisation which hence leads to the under development of real estate since it is a business.

=== Fiscal impact ===
The fiscal deficit grows as a result of suburbanization, mainly because in less densely populated areas, property taxes tend to be lower. Also, because of the typical spread pattern of suburban housing, the lack of variety of housing types, and the greater distance between homes, real estate development and public service costs increase, which in turn increase the deficit of upper levels of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sprawl Costs: Economic Impacts of Unchecked Development|year=2005|publisher=Island Press|pages=80–81|author1=Anthony Downs |author2=Barbara McCann |author3=Sahan Mukherji |author4=Robert Burchell }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect on urban diversity ===
As the trend of suburbanization took hold, many of the people who left the city for the suburbs were white. As a result, there was a rise in black home ownership in central cities. As white households left for the suburbs, housing prices in transition neighborhoods fell, which often lowered the cost of home ownership for black households. This trend was stronger in older and denser cities, especially in the northeast and Midwest, because new construction was generally more difficult. As of the 2010 Census, minorities like African Americans, Asian Americans and Indo-Americans have become an increasing large factor in recent suburbanization. Many suburbs now have since 1990 large minority communities in suburban and commuter cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Leah Platt |last1=Boustan |first2=Robert A. |last2=Margo |year=2013 |title=A Silver Lining to White Flight?

'''&lt;big&gt;Environmental Impacts&lt;/big&gt;'''

With the growth of suburbanization and the spread of people living outside the city this can cause negative impacts on the environment. Suburbanization has been linked to the increase in vehicle mileage, increase land use, and increase in residential energy consumption. From these factors of suburbanization, it has then caused a degradation of air quality, increase usage of natural resources like water and oil, as well as increased amounts of greenhouse gas. With the increased use of vehicles to commute to and from the work place this causes increased use of oil and gas as well as an increase in emissions. With the increase in emissions from vehicles, this then can cause air pollution and degrades the air quality of an area. Suburbanization is growing which causes an increase in housing development which causes an increase in [[land consumption]] and available land. Suburbanization has also been linked to increase in natural resource use like water to meet residents' demands and to maintain suburban lawns. Also, with the increase in technology and consumptions of residents there is an increase in energy consumption by the amount of electricity used by residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahn|first=Matthew E|year=2000|title=The Environmental Impact of Suburbanization|url=|journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management|volume=19|issue=4|pages=569–586|via=|doi=10.1002/1520-6688(200023)19:4&lt;569::aid-pam3&gt;3.3.co;2-g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suburbanization has negative social impacts on many groups of people, including children, adolescents, and the elderly.  Children who are affected by suburbanization, or urban sprawl, are commonly referred to as "cul-de-sac kids."  Because children living in a suburb cannot go anywhere without a parent, they are unable to practice being independent.  Teenagers that are unable to be independent experience a lot of boredom, isolation, and frustration.  These feelings have even led to an increase in rates of teenage suicide and school shootings in suburban areas.  Despite these issues with young people, suburbia was still intended for young families.  The elderly in suburbia experience social isolation once they lose their license to drive.  In order to leave their home the elderly need to be able to afford a chauffeur or be willing to ask relatives to drive them around.  This has resulted in upper-class elderly moving to retirement communities.  Both the wealthy elderly and those who still live in suburbs are largely separated from all other groups of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Suburban nation : the rise of sprawl and the decline of the American Dream|last=Andres|first=Duany|publisher=|others=Plater-Zyberk, Elizabeth, Speck, Jeff|year=|isbn=9780865477506|edition=10th anniversary |location=New York|pages=|oclc=555656296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founder Alan Schubert==
The Pride Center grew out of the initial vision of founder Alan Schubert, one of the earliest public leaders of [[Fort Lauderdale]]'s gay and lesbian community. Schubert died of cancer on June 1, 2016. He was 70 years old. Schubert's legacy includes the Pride Center where the main building bears his name and a long history of financial support and bringing community resources together on behalf of causes that included "the Broward Gay and Lesbian Youth Group, the Child Care Connection, the Jewish AIDS Network, Broward Public Library, Human Rights Campaign, Center One and Tuesday's Angels."&lt;ref name="sflagn6816"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Pride Center Founder Dies: Cancer claims Alan Schubert|url=http://southfloridagaynews.com/Local/pride-center-founder-dies.html|publisher=South Florida Gay News|date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his death, The Pride Center said: Alan Schubert's "impact on this community and beyond is immeasurable. In 1993, Schubert--philanthropist and gay pioneer--conceived the idea for the then Gay and Lesbian Community Center of South Florida. Alan determined that a safe community center in Fort Lauderdale could assist existing and new groups serving the LGBTQ communities."&lt;ref name="sflagn6816"/&gt;

==Housing for LGBT Seniors==
In August 2016, a partnership between the Pride Center and [[Carrfour Supportive Housing]] secured financing to develop, build and operate [[South Florida]]'s first [[supportive housing]] community that will significantly serve [[LGBT|gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender]] seniors.&lt;ref name="herald061216"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mask|first=Carina|title=The future of senior housing for the LGBTQ community|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/gay-south-florida/palette-magazine/article82490457.html|publisher=Miami Herald|date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mhn082616"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Samantha|title=First Affordable LGBT Senior Housing to Rise in South Florida|url=https://www.multihousingnews.com/post/first-affordable-lgbt-senior-housing-to-rise-in-south-florida/|publisher=Multi Housing News|date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sfbw082816"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Carrfour plans affordable housing at Pride Center in Wilton Manors|url=http://sfbwmag.com/2016/08/carrfour-plans-affordable-housing-at-pride-center-in-wilton-manors/|publisher=South Florida Business &amp; Wealth|date=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrfour's competitive application for [[tax credit]]s won funding from Florida Housing Finance Corporation for "housing credit and gap financing for [[affordable housing]] developments for persons with a [[disability|disabling condition]]," providing the financing needed to begin construction of The Residences at Equality Park as an initial 48-unit apartment complex on the Pride Center's campus at North Dixie Highway and Northeast 20th Drive in [[Wilton Manors]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="sentinel0823"&gt;{{cite web|last=Owers|first=Paul|title=Affordable housing project in Wilton Manors will cater to LGBT seniors|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/business/realestate/fl-lgbt-housing-wilton-manors-20160823-story.html|publisher=South Florida Sun Sentinel|date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="realdeal082316"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kallergis|first=Katherine|title=Carrfour, the Pride Center team up for LGBT senior housing in Broward|url=http://therealdeal.com/miami/2016/08/23/carrfour-the-pride-center-team-up-for-lgbt-senior-housing-in-broward/|publisher=South Florida Real Estate News|date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sflabiz082316"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bandell|first=Brian|title=Developer reveals plans for LGBT-focused senior housing community|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/news/2016/08/23/developer-reveals-plans-for-lgbt-focused-senior.html|publisher=South Florida Business Journal|date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effort to create affordable, supportive housing in Wilton Manors began in 2012 when City Commissioner Tom Green proposed development of [[affordable housing]] for the community's primarily [[LGBT]] seniors.&lt;ref name="pcvoicew16"&gt;{{cite web|last=Boo|first=Robert|title=Home Sweet Home: Center explores paths to affordable senior housing on campus|url=http://www.pridecenterflorida.org/wpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/VOICE-Winter2016_FINAL_small-2.pdf|publisher=Pride Center Voice|date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="herald05022016"&gt;{{cite web|last=Borg|first=Jeff|title=Welcome to South Florida's gayborhoods|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/gay-south-florida/palette-magazine/article69828057.html|publisher=Miami Herald|date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, the proposal won unanimous support from the City Commission to create "12,346 square feet of retail space and 130 affordable housing units" within The Pride Center's five-acre campus.&lt;ref name="pride center"&gt;[http://www.pridecenterflorida.org] - Pride Center Florida Official Website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sflagaynews2015"&gt;{{cite web|last=d'Oliveira|first=Michael|title=Senior Residences Planned for Equality Park|url=http://southfloridagaynews.com/Wilton-Manors-Gazette/senior-residences-planned-for-equality-park.html|publisher=South Florida Gay News|date=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pride Center formally partnered with Carrfour to pursue funding, develop and operate the housing complex.&lt;ref name="mfexec082016"&gt;{{cite web|last=Croce|first=Brian|title=Senior LGBT Development on Tap for South Florida - Carrfour Supportive Housing has been selected to build 48 affordable apartments on The Pride Center's campus|url=http://www.multifamilyexecutive.com/design-development/senior-lgbt-development-on-tap-for-south-florida_o|publisher=Multi Family Executive|date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''urban planner''' is a professional who practices in the field of [[urban planning]]. 

An urban planner may focus on a specific area of practice and have a title such as city planner, town planner, regional planner, long-range planner, transportation planner, infrastructure planner, environmental planner, parks planner, physical planner, health planner, planning analyst, urban designer, community development director, economic development specialist or other similar combinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planning Specializations|url=https://www.planning.org/choosingplanning/specializations/|website=Choosing the Planning Profession|publisher=American Planning Association|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Job Titles - Urban and land use planners (NOC 2153-A)|url=https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/job_titles-eng.do;jsessionid=755C0BE610A7CF0F664ADE37A76DE867.imnav4?area=9219&amp;lang=eng&amp;noc=2153&amp;backurl=%2Freport-eng.do%3Farea%3D9219%26lang%3Deng%26noc%3D2153|website=National Occupational Classification 2011 -ESDC|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An international association of planning professionals - ISOCARP - was established in 1965 in the Netherlands and currently has about 700 members in more than 80 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Home - ISOCARP|url = http://isocarp.org/|website = ISOCARP|access-date = 2018-10-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Home - Wikipedia/ISOCARP|url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISOCARP|website = Wikipedia|access-date = 2018-10-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibilities==
{{see also|Planning permission}}
The responsibilities of an urban planner vary between [[jurisdictions]], and sometimes within jurisdictions. The following is therefore a general description of the responsibilities of an urban planner, of which an urban planner may well typically practice two or more of. An urban planner may also specialize in one responsibility only.
 
===Land use planning===

Urban planners specializing in [[land use planning]] are predominantly concerned with the regulation of [[land use]], [[Land development|development]] and [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]], with the intent of achieving the desired urban planning outcome.

Regulation of land use and development is achieved via the drafting and adoption of planning instruments designed to influence the land use and built form goals of the jurisdiction. The planning instruments take the form of legislation and policy, and have a wide variety of terms across jurisdictions including [[Primary and secondary legislation|acts and regulations]], rules, [[Code of law|codes]], schemes, plans, policies, and manuals; and often a combination of some of these. The planning instruments often spatially zone land or reserve the land for certain purposes, presented in the form of a [[Zoning|zoning map or plan]]. The urban planner is tasked with preparing planning instruments and zoning plans. Further, given urban development is rarely static and the goals of urban planning change from time to time, the urban planner will be responsible for continuously maintaining planning instruments and zoning plans to ensure they are kept up-to-date.

Consultation with the community and other stakeholders is generally desired by urban planners in most jurisdictions when planning instruments are prepared and updated. The level of consultation will vary depending on the project.

The urban planner will also be responsible for implementing the planning instruments. This is achieved through a permit process, where the proponent of a proposed development, a change in land use, or the proposed subdivision of an allotment will be required to obtain a permit, approval, licence, or consent for the proposed development or change of use. An urban planner will be tasked with considering the proposal and determining whether it complies with the intent and the specific provisions of the applicable planning instruments and zoning plans. Depending on the jurisdiction, the urban planner may have authority to determine the proposal; otherwise the planner will present a recommendation to the decision-maker, often a panel of non-planners (for example, the elected council of a local government).

While concerned with future development, an urban planner will occasionally be responsible for investigating development or land use which had been undertaken without authorization. In many jurisdictions urban planners can require that unauthorized land use cease and unauthorized development is returned to its predevelopment condition; or alternatively retrospectively approve the unauthorized development or land use.

===Strategic urban planning===

In order to plan effectively for long term development and growth, an urban planner will be responsible for the preparation of a strategic plan (also known in different jurisdictions by names such as [[development plan]], [[Core strategy document|core strategy]], [[Comprehensive planning|comprehensive plan]], planning strategy, [[structure plan]], etc.). Strategic urban planning sets the high-level goals and growth principles for a jurisdiction, which will in turn inform the preparation and amendment of the legal planning instruments within that jurisdiction.

===Regional planning===
{{main|Regional planning}}
Regional planning deals with the planning of land use, infrastructure and settlement growth over a geographical area which extends to a whole city or beyond. In this sense, the urban planner's role is to consider urban planning at a macro scale. Regional planning is not concerned with planning at the local (neighborhood) level.

===Heritage and conservation===

An urban planner may be responsible for identifying, protecting and [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conserving / restoring]] buildings and places which are identified by a community as having [[cultural heritage]] significance. This may include the task of compiling and maintaining a [[heritage register]], finding and making available incentives for encouraging conservation works, and the consideration of proposals to redevelop or use a heritage-listed place.

===Urban renewal===

As urban areas decline, an urban planner may be tasked with preparing a plan for the redevelopment of an urban area. Such plans are not limited to an individual development site, but rather encompass a locality or district over which an urban renewal (or redevelopment) plan is prepared.

Urban renewal often relies on obtaining funding from government sources to assist in the regeneration of an area; the funding may be used for a variety of purposes such as improvement of public roads, parks and other public spaces, development of infrastructure, and acquisition of land. The urban planner will be responsible for costing an urban renewal plan and obtaining funding for infrastructure works necessary to implement the urban renewal plan.

The urban planner for an urban renewal project will need to liaise closely with stakeholders during the preparation and implementation of the plan, including government agencies, landowners and community groups.

===Master planning===

A master plan will be prepared for many [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] development projects. The purpose of a master plan is to plan for the ultimate spatial layout of the land uses for a future development area. A master plan will consider the required infrastructure to service the development and determine the need and location of urban amenities including commercial and industrial land, community facilities, schools, parks, public transport, major roads, and land uses, both within and outside the master plan area, and consider the staging of development of a master planned area.

The urban planner will be responsible for coordinating the various professional consultant inputs, and to lay out the master plan infrastructure and land uses. It will often be necessary for the urban planner to consult with landowners and government agencies affected by the master plan.

===Transportation planning===

An urban planner may be responsible for planning for [[transport]] facilities and infrastructure in urban and inter-regional areas.

===Economic development===

An urban planner's responsibility may extend to economic development. In this sense, an urban planner may be responsible for identifying opportunities for [[economic growth]], and encourage [[investment]] in an area.

===Environmental planning===

An urban planner may be concerned with the impact of land use, development and subdivision on the [[Natural resource|natural environment]] including land, water, flora, and fauna, to achieve [[sustainable]] outcomes.

===Urban design===

An urban planner will develop the design of public spaces (streets, squares, parks, etc.) and the relationship between built form and public spaces. Depending on the country and planner's training they may work with other design professionals such as civil engineers, architects or landscape architects to complete and construct the design.

===Infrastructure planning===

An urban planner may be required to plan for the future provision of [[public works]] [[infrastructure]] such as [[water supply]], [[sewerage]], [[electricity]], [[telecommunications]], and [[transport]] infrastructure, and community infrastructure including [[schools]], [[hospitals]] and [[parks]].

==Education and training==

''See [[Urban planning education]] for a discussion of this topic.''

Urban Planning as a profession is a relatively young discipline. Few government agencies restrict or license the profession. As a result, a number of other related disciplines actively claim to have the training, expertise and professional scope to practice urban planning. While organizations such as the [[American Planning Association]], the [[Canadian Institute of Planners]] and the [[Royal Town Planning Institute]] certify professional planners, others in related fields like [[Landscape Architecture]] also claim to have professional autonomy in urban planning. Efforts internationally have attempted to define the role of urban planners through licensure acts. The State of [[New Jersey]] licenses Professional Planners. The Canadian Provinces of Ontario and Alberta protect the title of [[Registered Professional Planner]] to only those who have an accredited CIP education and experience or equivalent.

==Urban planners by nation==

===Canada===

Urban planners in Canada usually hold bachelor's degrees in planning or a master's degree, typically accredited as an M.Pl, MUP (Master of Urban Planning) MCP (Master of City Planning), MScPl, MES (Master of Environmental Studies) or simply an MA.

===Greece===

Urban planners in [[Greece]] typically graduate from  [[Engineering]] faculties. [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] and [[University of Thessaly]] are the two universities that provide undergraduate studies in [[urban planning]] in [[Greece]].

===India===

Though planning is not a recognized profession under Indian law, the profession began in 1941 with the [[School of Planning and Architecture]] as a Department of Architecture of Delhi College of Engineering now the [[Delhi Technological University]]. It was later integrated with the School of Town and Country Planning which was established in 1955 by the [[Government of India]] to provide facilities for rural, urban and regional planning. On integration, the school was renamed as School of Planning and Architecture in 1959. Today, it is one of the premier schools of pursuing planning studies at bachelor, masters and post doctorate levels.

The [http://itpi.org.in/content/default.aspx Institute of Town Planners, India] (ITPI), set up on the lines of the [[Royal Town Planning Institute]] in [[London]] is the body representing planning professionals in India. A small group formed itself into an Indian Board of Town Planners which after three years of continuous work formed the ITPI. The institute, which was established in July 1951, today, has a membership of over 2800, apart from a sizable number of student members, many of whom have qualified Associateship Examination (AITP) conducted by ITPI. As of 2012, the institute has 21 regional chapters across India.
School of Planning and Architecture(SPA),Delhi is one of the premier institute in dissemination knowledge of Architecture and Planning in India. It was established in 1941.In 1979, the Government of India, through the then Ministry of Education and Culture, conferred on the School of Planning and Architecture the status of "Deemed to be a University"(http://spa.ac.in/Home.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f)
[[School of Planning and Architecture-Bhopal]] (M.P.)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spabhopal.ac.in/&lt;/ref&gt; and School of Planning and Architecture-Vijayawada established in year 2008 by Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India.
Centre for Environment Planning and Technology (CEPT) University [http://cept.ac.in] in Ahmedabad and Malaviya National Institute of Technology (NIT) Jaipur, Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology (N.I.T) in Bhopal along with NIT Patna are one of the pioneering Institutes in India where urban planning is taught.

===Israel===

The [[Israel Planners Association]] was founded in 1965. Urban planning is taught by the [[Technion]] [http://architecture.technion.ac.il/en/ Faculty of Architecture and Urban Planning] in [[Haifa]] and the [http://curs.net.technion.ac.il/ Center for Urban and Regional Studies].

===Mexico===

Urban planners in Mexico typically graduate from an Architecture background provided by major universities in the country. Most of such degrees can be awarded at Masters' graduate studies, although there are also bachelor's degrees available.

===New Zealand===

A planner brings professional expertise and knowledge to the development and implementation of policy in the interests of productive, liveable and sustainable environments. Planners support communities and provide leadership in making informed choices about the consequences of human actions and in bridging the gap between the present and the future. Planners must consider and balance a range of strategic, policy, technical, legal, administrative, community and environmental factors in their contributions to informed decision-making.

Planners are employed in diverse public and private roles. They use their knowledge and experience in various institutional and community settings to provide leadership, undertake research, solve problems, evaluate alternatives and outcomes, manage change, and envision, advise on and enact desirable future directions.

In applying their expertise, planners must be aware of and responsive to cultural, social, economic, environmental, ethical and political values. In New Zealand, these include the bicultural mandate for planning, including the partnership relationships established by the Treaty of Waitangi/te Tiriti o Waitangi, and New Zealand’s increasingly multicultural society.

A key attribute of a planner is the ability to work across disciplinary and institutional boundaries and to integrate knowledge from a range of disciplines within the distinctive framework of the discipline of planning.

A professional planner is someone who has gained a professional qualification through tertiary study, continues to learn post qualification, undertakes continuing professional development, is a member or is working towards becoming a member of the [http://www.planning.org.nz/ New Zealand Planning Institute (NZPI)], contributes to the planning profession, and is committed to upholding the principles and ethical practices of the planning profession.

For a list of NZPI recognized degrees, [http://www.planning.org.nz/Category?Action=View&amp;Category_id=647 click here]. 

===Nigeria===

In [[Nigeria]], the [[Nigerian Institute of Town Planners]] (NITP) and the [[Town Planners Registration Council]] (TOPREC) are the leading bodies tasked with the responsibility of improving the training, education and professional practice of planning in Nigeria.

To be a town planner in Nigeria, first must complete a degree in Urban and regional planning or a relevant discipline and then complete a final year in the form of a masters in Urban and regional planning  which must be accredited by the [[Town Planners Registration Council]] (TOPREC ), or a four-year degree encapsulating all aspects. they can then become eligible to be a member of the [[Nigerian Institute of Town Planners]] (NITP), but must first complete two years work based training, to be a full member, and subsequently register and sit for the TOPREC professional examination, to become a registered town planner.

===South Africa===

The [[South African Council for Planners]] ([http://www.sacplan.org.za SACPLAN]) is the statutory Council of nominated members appointed in terms of the Planning Profession Act, 2002 (Act 36 of 2002) by the Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform (Department of Rural Development and Land Reform) to regulate the Planning Profession(Planning is both the organizational process of creating and maintaining a plan) in terms of the Act. The Planning Profession Principles applies to all registered planners. The SACPLAN through the Act assures quality in the planning profession through the identification of planning profession work that only registered planners can undertake. The functions of the SACPLAN are contained in Section 7 of the Act. The powers and duties of the SACPLAN are contained in Section 8 of the Act. The Act further prescribes a Professional Code of Conduct for registered planners &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacplan.org.za|title=SACPLAN - SACPLAN|author=Administrator|work=sacplan.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

Those wishing to be a town or country planner, in the [[United Kingdom]], first must complete a degree in a relevant discipline and then complete a final year in the form of a masters in town and country planning   which must be accredited by the [[Royal Town Planning Institute]] (RTPI), or a four-year degree encapsulating all aspects. they can then become eligible to be a member of the RTPI, but must first complete two years work based training, to be a full member.

Town planners in the UK are responsible for all aspects of the built environment, wherever you are within the UK a town and country planner will have at sometime planned the built aspects of the environment. They (Local Planning Authorities) grant planning permission (consent) to individuals, private builders and corporations and also aid local government with their decisions.

===United States===
Planners in the U.S. typically complete an undergraduate or graduate degree from a university offering the program of study.  Professional certification is only offered through the [[American Institute of Certified Planners]] (AICP), a branch of the [[American Planning Association]].  To gain AICP certification, a planner must meet specific educational and experience requirements, as well as pass an exam covering the nature and practice of the discipline.  Although AICP certification is not required to be a practicing planner, it does serve as a means in which a planner can verify his or her professional expertise.

===Palestine===
Planners in Palestine took responsibility after the Palestinian Authority took governance in the West Bank and Gaza- Palestine. Planners have been trained by a Norwegian consultants As Plan Viak at the very beginning as part of the institutional capacity training project funded by the Norwegian Government. Both Birzeit and Alanjah Universities run bachelor and master degree in planning and planners could specialized in different fields.

A '''volunteer fire department''' ('''VFD''') is a [[fire department]] composed of [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s who perform fire suppression and other related [[emergency service]]s for a local jurisdiction.

Volunteer firefighters contrast with career firefighters, who work full-time and receive a full salary. Some volunteer firefighters may be part of a [[combination fire department]] that employs both full-time and volunteer firefighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.owlvfd.org/recruitment.aspx|title=OWL - Recruitment|website=www.owlvfd.org|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://crfr.us/|title=Colorado River Fire Rescue {{!}} Serving Rifle, Silt,  New Castle, CO|website=crfr.us|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some communities, the definition of a volunteer firefighter includes those who receive some pay for being [[On call shift|on call]] and/or attending emergencies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kelowna.ca/city-services/emergency-services/fire-department/paid-call-volunteer|title=Paid on call (volunteer) - City of Kelowna|accessdate=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; known in other countries as [[Retained firefighters|"retained" firefighters]]. Volunteer and retained firefighters are expected to be on call to respond to [[Emergency telephone number|emergency calls]] for long periods of time, and are summoned to the [[fire station]] when their services are needed. They are also expected to attend other non-emergency duties as well (training, fundraising, equipment maintenance, etc.).

== International ==
The earliest firefighting organizations were made up volunteers. The first large organized force of firefighters was the Corps of [[Vigiles]], established in [[ancient Rome]] in 6 AD.

=== Argentina ===
The first volunteer fire department in Argentina was Bomberos Voluntarios de La Boca (La Boca Volunteer Firemen) founded on June 2, 1884, by Italian immigrant Tomas Liberti in the neighborhood of [[La Boca]], [[Buenos Aires]]. June 2 is the Day of Volunteer Firefighters. The Argentina Federation of Volunteer Firefighters was founded in 1954. In 2018, 80% of the country is covered by volunteers.

=== Australia ===
Throughout Australia there are many volunteer firefighting agencies which are set up by the individual states or territories. New South Wales is serviced by two statutory firefighting authorities. These are the New South Wales Rural Fire Service ([[New South Wales Rural Fire Service|NSWRFS]]) and [[Fire and Rescue NSW]]. Fire and Rescue NSW has firefighting and rescue responsibilities for the major cities, metropolitan areas and several other towns in NSW. It also has the responsibility for all land based [[HAZMAT]] incidents as well as inland waterway based  [[HAZMAT]] incidents.  The NSWRFS is the volunteer firefighting service in NSW and consists of over 70,000 volunteers and has responsibility for over 90% of the land area in NSW. Although most of this is bush and grass land, the NSWRFS also serve smaller and regional communities that are not covered by Fire and Rescue NSW. Despite some overlapping in firefighting coverage/resources by both services, the NSWRFS does not provide rescue or HAZMAT services in the State.

In Victoria, there are three main fire fighting organisations, Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board ([[Metropolitan Fire Brigade (Melbourne)|MFB]]), Country Fire Authority ([[Country Fire Authority|CFA]]) and The Department of Environment, Water, Land, and Planning ([[Department of Environment, Water, Land, and Planning, Victoria|DEWLP]]). The CFA is a volunteer and community based fire and emergency services organisation that is made up of around 61,000 members. Of these members, some 59,000 are volunteers. Their roles range from fire, rescue, HAZMAT, to non-operational support roles.

In Western Australia, fire fighting is organised by the [[Department of Fire and Emergency Services]] (DFES) together with Local Councils. DFES operate the Volunteer Fire and Rescue Service Brigades (VFRS) and some Bush Fire Service Brigades (BFS), while the remainder of the Bush Fire Service Brigades are trained by DFES, but operated and administrated by the Council of the associated area. VFRS Brigades are generally more involved in Structural Fire fighting, Asset Protection and Road Crash Rescue depending on their location, whereas the BFS Brigades are generally more involved in Wildfire Fighting. In Western Australia there is an estimated 31,000 BFS Members among 585 Brigades,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfes.wa.gov.au/aboutus/operationalinformation/pages/bushfireservice.aspx/ FESA Bush Fire Service Page]&lt;/ref&gt; and 2,000 VFRS Members among 88 Brigades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfes.wa.gov.au/aboutus/operationalinformation/Pages/volunteerfireandrescueservice.aspx/ DFES Volunteer Fire and Rescue Service Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Australia, there are two legislated fire fighting organisations. The South Australian Metropolitan Fire Service (SAMFS) and the South Australian Country Fire Service (SACFS). The SACFS is staffed by approximately 13,500 volunteer fire fighters and around 120 paid employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfs.sa.gov.au/site/about.jsp CFS :: About]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Austria, Germany and Switzerland ===
Volunteer fire departments (''Freiwillige Feuerwehr'') provide the majority (97% of all German fire fighters) of Austria's and [[German fire services|Germany's]] [[Civil defense|civil protection services]], alongside other volunteer organizations like the [[Technisches Hilfswerk|Germany Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW)]], voluntary ambulance services and emergency medical or rescue services like [[German Red Cross]] or [[Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe]]. In most rural fire departments, the staff consists only of volunteers. The members of these departments are usually on-call 24/7 and working in other professions.

The alarm can be performed by different alarm systems, such as by sirens or pager. In Germany, the alarm via radio pager is on the frequencies of the [[:de:BOS-Funk|BOS]] radio. In Austria, the fire departments have their own frequencies.

In medium-sized cities and communities, fire departments will often be partially staffed by career firefighters. They ensure the rapid availability of some of the department's fire apparatus, with the remaining apparatus staffed and brought to the scene of the emergency by volunteers as soon as they arrive at the department.

Larger cities, typically those with 100,000 inhabitants or more, will operate fire departments staffed entirely by career firefighters. However, they also typically have several volunteer fire departments, who are called upon in case of larger emergencies.

Municipalities are the support of volunteer fire departments. Additional funding may include, for example, contributions from support organizations, donations made in fundraising or income from various events.

===Canada===
Volunteer fire departments are mostly found in rural and remote areas of Canada, with 127,000 such firefighters across the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firefightingincanada.com/content/view/2136/213/&lt;/ref&gt; Most urban and larger fire services began as volunteer service and evolved into full-time members. Volunteer departments are necessary for areas that cannot afford to staff a full-time department.

=== Chile ===
[[Chile]] is the only country in the world in which all firefighters are unpaid. The local fire departments are part of the National Board of Firefighters (''Junta Nacional de Bomberos''). Since the [[Great Fire of Valparaíso]] in April 2014 a long debate has been going on whether firefighters should be paid.

=== Finland ===
In [[Finland]] the firefighting in the countryside mostly depends on volunteer fire departments, nearly always with a contract with the regional emergency authorities (or, formerly and in [[Åland]], the municipality). There are volunteer fire departments also in cities, but there with a minor role.

=== Indonesia ===
In [[Indonesia]], the city with the biggest number of volunteer fire brigades is [[Banjarmasin]], [[South Kalimantan]] province. The city is also sometimes nicknamed "''kota seribu pemadam kebakaran''" (The city with a thousand of fire brigades). Access of water is also relatively easy as rivers are easily founded at the city to be the source of water for fire fighting. The need of more fire brigades in the city emerged when people realized the very frequent incidents of fire, especially [[structure fire]] because houses are traditionally made out of wood, and also hence the hot temperature near the equator, fire incidents are common, thus many people made and become volunteer fire brigades to assist the existing government fire brigade (the ''Dinas Pemadam Kebakaran''). These volunteer fire brigades are paid [[Indonesian rupiah|Rp]] 0.000,- but in some cases, some people give them money for charitable reasons.

=== Republic of Ireland ===
The [[Auxiliary Fire Service]] (AFS) in the [[Republic of Ireland]] is a branch of the national [[Civil Defence Ireland|civil defence]] organisation. The service is usually only called upon for flooding incidents, emergency water supply and large-scale incidents where the resources of front-line fire brigades are stretched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Dublin Civil Defence | url=http://www.dublincivildefence.com/services.php | title=Irish Auxiliary Fire Service | date=2008-06-29 | access-date=2008-12-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206033553/http://www.dublincivildefence.com/services.php | archive-date=2008-12-06 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nicaragua ===
In [[Nicaragua]] there are three different groups of firefighters, one ruled by the Direccion General de Bomberos 18 fire station which has government support and the other two Federación de Cuerpos de Bomberos de Nicaragua Benemeritos with 8 fire station and  Asociacion civil Cuerpo de BOMBEROS Voluntarios de Nicaragua 24 fire station are volunteers firefighters around the Country.

=== Peru ===
Peru's ''bomberos'' are all unpaid volunteers that put out fires, clear up hazardous materials, aid in natural disasters, and bring the sick to hospitals, in a 150-year tradition. Citizens apply to enter a training program they must pay for with their own money. There they’ll learn how to put out fires, provide first aid and use specialized equipment. If they complete the program they enter a probation period where they have to prove they are capable of dealing with real-life emergencies.

===Poland===
[[State Fire Service]] ({{lang-pl|Państwowa Straż Pożarna}}) is a professional firefighting service that covers whole territory from their stations in cities and towns. In rural areas however, local inhabitants may create a [[Voluntary Fire Service]] (''Ochotnicza Straż Pożarna'') under proper law. Such volunteer fire service may receive a financial help from the government for the equipment and staff training. In certain areas of Poland almost every village has a volunteer fire service because members of such enjoy high respect in their community. On the other hand, volunteer fire service is fully integrated with the emergency system. Any call to fire emergency number is routed to the nearest State Fire Service station which firstly deploys the nearest volunteer fire service and later aids them with the state forces.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the [[United Kingdom]], the only autonomous volunteer fire service is the [[Peterborough Volunteer Fire Brigade]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambsfire.gov.uk/peterborough-volunteers-850.aspx Peterborough Volunteers]&lt;/ref&gt; which is contracted to provide operations for [[Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service]]. Other voluntary fire brigades existed in the past, but no others have existed since the disbanding of the [[Auxiliary Fire Service]] in 1968.
It is standard for smaller, rural stations to be manned by '''retained firefighters''', who are part-time firefighters who live or work in the vicinity of a fire station and spend long periods of time on call. There are some voluntary units that are part of a regular fire service, such as the Borth Voluntary Fire Unit is under the command of [[Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mawwfire.gov.uk/English/Area/Ceredigion-Command/Pages/Borth.aspx Borth - Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scottish Fire and Rescue Service]] and [[North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service]] also have some volunteer-operated stations.

=== United States ===
[[File:Demorest-Firefighter.JPG|thumb|A volunteer firefighter stands to the edge of a road.]]
According to the [[National Fire Protection Association]], 69 percent of firefighters in the [[United States]] are volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;National Fire Protection Association. [http://www.nfpa.org/~/media/files/research/nfpa%20reports/fire%20service%20statistics/osfdprofile.pdf The U.S. Fire Service]. Accessed 2012 U.S. Fire Experience Survey.&lt;/ref&gt; The Volunteer Firefighter Alliance represents Volunteer Firefighters across the U.S., as well the [[National Volunteer Fire Council]] represents the fire and emergency services on a national level, providing advocacy, information, resources, and programs to support volunteer first responders. The NVFC includes 49 state-based firefighter associations such as the Firemen's Association of the State of New York (FASNY), which provides information, education and training for the volunteer fire and emergency medical services throughout [[New York State]].

Volunteer firefighters go through some or all of the same training as career personnel do; this too varies between jurisdictions. When volunteers join a department, they often sign up for firefighting classes and other certifications that teach them what they need to know to become a volunteer firefighter. Examples of these certifications include Firefighter I, Firefighter II, [[S-130/S-190]], [[Emergency Medical Responder]], and [[Emergency Medical Technician]]. Some departments also require recruits to complete a certain amount of in-house training. During this time, often called the probationary period, the recruit is known as a [[probationary firefighter]], or "probie". Once the probationary period is complete, the member is eligible to become a full firefighter.

In the United States, the Department of Labor classifies volunteer firefighters as firefighters that receive no compensation or nominal fees up to 20% of the compensation a full-time firefighter would receive in the same capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Managing Volunteer Firefighters for FLSA Compliance: A Guide for Fire Chiefs and Community Leaders|url=http://www.vcos.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/FLSAManual_Small.pdf|publisher=International Association of Fire Chiefs|accessdate=11 October 2012|author=Dodge, G|author2=Mullarkey, M |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DOL allows volunteer firefighters to receive benefits such as worker's compensation, health insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, pension plans, length of service awards, and property tax relief. DOL-defined volunteer firefighters may be paid nominal fees on a per call basis, per shift basis, or various service requirements, but may not be compensated based on productivity such as with an hourly wage.

The terms "part paid" and "paid on-call" refer to firefighters that are receiving some compensation less than the compensation a full-time firefighter would receive. It may often refer to volunteer firefighters that do not qualify as volunteers under the United States Department of Labor. They may also volunteer time for training, public education, fund-raising, and other non-emergency department related activities.

In late 19th and early 20th century American slang, volunteer firefighters were referred to as "[[:wikt:Vamp|vamps]]", though the origin of this is obscure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/search?searchType=dictionary&amp;q=Vamp&amp;_searchBtn=Search "Vamp", Oxford English Dictionary];  retrieved 30 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial support==
[[File:Demorest-fire.jpg|thumb|right|Two [[Demorest, Georgia]] volunteer fire fighters respond to an emergency call.]]
A VFD may be financially supported by taxes raised in a city, town, county, fire district, or other governmental entity, as well as corporate and other private donations, federal grants, and other assistance from auxiliary members, or firefighters' associations.

With these funds the VFD acquires and operates the firefighting apparatus, equips and trains the firefighters, maintains the firehouse, and possibly also covers insurance, worker's compensation, and other post-injury or retirement benefits.  A VFD (or its governing entity) may also contract with other nearby departments to cover each other in a [[mutual aid (emergency services)|mutual aid]] (or automatic aid) pact as a means for assisting each other with equipment and manpower, when necessary.

==Expanded duties==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
Depending upon the location and availability of other services, a VFD may be responsible for controlling [[structure fire]]s as well as [[bushfire|forest fires]].  Because it may be the only emergency services department for some distance, a rural VFD may also be fortunate to include [[community first responder]]s, [[emergency medical technician]]s, Hazardous Materials response, and other specially qualified rescue personnel.  Law enforcement officers may also be trained in these related duties and overlap with the VFD.  The VFD may also have duties as the local [[fire inspector]]s, [[arson investigator]]s, and as [[fire safety]] and [[fire prevention|prevention]] education, in addition to being the local [[civil defense]] or [[disaster relief]] liaison.

==Emergency response==
[[File:2008-08-22 Swepsonville fire truck rushing.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Swepsonville, North Carolina|Swepsonville]] Volunteer Fire Department responding to a call.]]

A volunteer fire department is normally reached the same way as other emergency services, such as by calling [[9-1-1]] or [[1-1-2]].  A central dispatcher then calls out the VFD, often through equipment such as [[pager]]s, [[radio]]s, or loud signals, such as a [[fire siren]].  Average response times are longer than with full-time services because the members must come from different distances to the station or to the incident.  Such departments often have a fixed number of firefighters on staff at any given point in time, which sometimes equals the minimal numbers recommended. Some states allow the use of [[Length of service award program|Length of Service Award Programs (LOSAPS)]] to provide these volunteer departments with a tool to assist in recruiting and retaining members. LOSAPS are simple programs that can be implemented with minimal taxpayer expense.

Some volunteer fire departments allow the use of [[Courtesy lights]] or emergency lights and sirens by its members.  In most states that allow both lights and sirens, this is a red light and siren that gives the responding member the same privileges as other emergency vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lrc.ky.gov/krs/189-00/920.pdf Kentucky State Law 189.920]&lt;/ref&gt;  In other jurisdictions, this may be a green or blue light without a siren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs4.asp?DocName=062500050HCh%2E+12+Art%2E+II&amp;ActID=1815&amp;ChapAct=625%26nbsp%3BILCS%26nbsp%3B5%2F&amp;ChapterID=49&amp;ChapterName=VEHICLES&amp;SectionID=59744&amp;SeqStart=121100000&amp;SeqEnd=122900000&amp;ActName=Illinois+Vehicle+Code%2E | title=(625 ILCS 5) Illinois Vehicle Code}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of such equipment varies from fire district to fire district based on need for fast response, distance that members live from the fire station, the size and amount of other traffic in the fire district as well as local and state law.  Some departments restrict or prohibit use of such emergency lights, even when allowed by state law, due to the [[Courtesy lights#Danger|increased risk]] of traffic accidents involving volunteers responding in emergency mode.  In some states, volunteer firefighters and EMTs are eligible to receive specialty license plates for personal vehicles that identify them as trained emergency services personnel.

==Training==
[[File:Vehicle extrication demonstration and training.jpg|thumb|Volunteer firefighters participate in a [[vehicle extrication]] demonstration and training at a volunteer fire department open house]]
Operational volunteer fire department members receive some form of training, either in a formal or informal setting, depending on the state and regulatory authority. The level and type of basic and specialty training varies across the country.  The [[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA) has several published standards for fire fighter qualifications and training, including Standard for Fire Service Professional Qualifications Accreditation and Certification Systems, and Fire Fighter Professional Qualifications.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |last= |first=  |url=http://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=1001 |title=NFPA 1001 Standard for Fire Fighter Professional Qualifications |publisher=National Fire Protection Association |accessdate=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; These standards apply to both volunteer and career fire fighters.

New members are referred to as "recruits," "rookies," "probies" (short for "probationary"), or even "red hats" in some departments that require the recruit to wear special gear or markings (such as a red helmet in some departments) to denote their ranking.  Some departments allow (or even require) new recruits to ride along on fire apparatus as observers before undergoing the rigors of further fire training.

Fire fighters typically progress through formal Fire Fighter I and Fire Fighter II training in accordance with national standards.

Specialty training can include wildland firefighting, technical rescue, swift water rescue, hazardous materials response, vehicle extrication, [[firefighter assist and search team|FAST team]], fire instructor, fire officer and others.

==Open house==
A VFD may hold an "open house" at their station. The event serves many purposes including demonstration, training, drill, fundraising and recruitment. There is no particular format for the VFD open house. It can be formal or informal. The goal is to get public involvement in the VFD efforts. It is recommended that the open house should include demonstrations of equipment and [[Show and tell (education)|show and tell]]. This allows the public to understand how the volunteers are organized in their local community and it is used as a [[public relations]] tool. The combination of demonstrations and drills allow the public and prospect volunteers to see volunteer fire fighters in action while they are participating in the practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recruitment Techniques Part 1|url=http://www.volunteerfd.org/recruitment/articles/245140|publisher=VolunteerFD.org|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wadawida''' (pronounced more like vadavida) are a subgroup of the [[Taita people]] of South Eastern [[Kenya]] in East Africa. These Bantu speaking people are in origin and language more related to the [[Taveta people|Taveta]] (Tuweta) people of Kenya, and the Pare who live at the Pare Mountains, [[Chagga]] who live on the slopes of [[Kilimanjaro]] and Sambaa people of Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. 

These tribes together with the Waluguru form a group of some closely related in origin; Bantu speaking tribes who occupy the [https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/2085/ Ancient Eastern Arc Mountains]. These are some ancient ranges of Mountains that have now become a very important part of safaris in Tanzania. Many travellers now include hiking tours to these mountains especially in the Tanzania part.

The Wadawida people or Taita as they are commonly referred, are believed to have moved into their present Taita Hills as early as the 18th century.

The '''Ye'kuana''', also called '''Ye'kwana, Ye'Kuana, Yekuana, Yequana, Yecuana, Dekuana, Maquiritare, Makiritare, So'to''' or '''Maiongong''', are a [[Cariban]]-speaking tropical rain-forest tribe who live in the [[Caura River (Venezuela)|Caura River]] and [[Orinoco River]] regions of [[Venezuela]] in [[Bolivar State]] and [[Amazonas (Venezuelan state)|Amazonas State]]. In [[Brazil]], they inhabit the northeast of [[Roraima]] State.
In Venezuela, the Ye'kuana live alongside their former enemies, the [[Sanumá]] ([[Yanomami]] subgroup).

When the Ye'kuana wish to refer to themselves, they use the word '''So'to''', which can be translated as "people", "person". '''''Ye’kuana''''', in turn, can be translated as "canoe people", "people of the canoes"&lt;ref&gt;[http://yekuana.chez.com/OURWORLD/OUR%20WORLD.htm Ye'kuana – Our World]&lt;/ref&gt; or even "people of the branch in the river".

They live in communal houses called ''Atta'' or ''ëttë''. The circular structure has a cone-shaped roof made of palm leaves. Building the atta is considered a spiritual activity in which the group reproduces the great cosmic home of the Creator. 

The first reference to the Ye'kuana was in 1744 by a [[Jesuit]] priest called Manuel Román.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

The [[Alto Orinoco-Casiquiare Biosphere Reserve]] was established{{by whom?|date=April 2017}} in 1993 with the objective of preserving the traditional territory and lifestyle of the [[Yanomami]] and Ye'kuana peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|ref= {{harvid|Alto Orinoco-Casiquiare – UNESCO}}

 |url= http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=VEN+01&amp;mode=all |accessdate= 2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are some 6,250 Ye'kuana in Venezuela, according to the 2001 census, with some 430 in Brazil.  

[[Jean Liedloff]] came into contact with the Ye'kuana in the 1950s, while working as a photographer for Italian diamond-hunters, and in subsequent personal visits. She based her book ''[[The Continuum Concept]]: In Search of Happiness Lost'' on their way of life, particularly the upbringing of their children. Liedloff noted the stark contrast between the treatment of Western and Ye'kuana infants, who are normally held "in-arms" 24 hours a day by their mothers and by other familiar adults and children who take care of them.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Zafimaniry''' are a sub-group of the [[Betsileo people|Betsileo]] [[ethnic groups of Madagascar|ethnic group of Madagascar.]] They live in the forested mountains of the southern central highlands southeast of [[Ambositra]], between the neighboring Betsileo and [[Tanala]] peoples. There are approximately 100 Zafimaniry villages, which support a population of approximately 25,000. The Zafimaniry speak a dialect of the [[Malagasy language]], which is a branch of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian language group]] which comes from the [[Barito languages]], that are spoken in southern [[Borneo]].

They are known for their [[Architecture of Madagascar#Zafimaniry traditions|woodcarving knowledge and art]], which was added in 2003 to [[UNESCO]]'s list of the world's [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|Intangible Cultural Heritage]]. This style of woodworking was once common throughout [[Madagascar]] but has decreased because of deforestation. Their art is considered by historians to provide insight into the applied arts of the past in Madagascar.

==Ethnic identity==
There are an estimated 25,000 Zafimaniry in Madagascar today.&lt;ref name=zafi/&gt; The Zafimaniry are descendants of both the [[Betsimisaraka people|Betsimisaraka]] and [[Tanala]] ethnic groups, but are differentiated from both primarily by the nature of the damp and cold mountain forests where they settled.{{sfn|Bloch|1995|p=89}}  In former Zafimaniry areas where the forest has been lost and terraced rice cultivation has begun, these communities are considered [[Betsileo people|Betsileo]] by the "real" Zafimaniry who still live in forests and maintain their traditional way of life.{{sfn|Bloch|1995|p=90}}

==History==
[[File:Ethnic groups of Madagascar Map.png|thumb|left|200px|Distribution of Malagasy ethnic groups. Zafimaniry are classified as Betsileo.]]
The Zafimaniry people migrated to the dense forests of southeastern Madagascar in the 18th century due to increasing deforestation in other parts of the island.&lt;ref name=zafi&gt;{{cite web| title= The Woodcrafting Knowledge of the Zafimaniry |publisher = UNESCO | year = 2008 | url= http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/woodcrafting-knowledge-of-the-zafimaniry-00080 |accessdate= 23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zafimaniry villages were among those targeted for retaliation by French soldiers during the [[Malagasy Uprising|1947 Uprising]] against colonial rule, leading many villagers to flee to the forest where they lived nomadically for two years.{{sfn|Breyer|2007|p=86}} The Zafimaniry community was not particularly involved in the uprising but suffered disproportionately because their villages were located along the route taken by major instigator communities in the southeast to reach French encampments in the central highlands, leading the French to believe the Zafimaniry were complicit. As French forces "secured" various portions of Zafimaniry territory, they arrested the local inhabitants and sent them to concentration camps,{{sfn|Breyer|2007|p=87}} sometimes burning down the villages as well.{{sfn|Breyer|2007|p=86}}

==Society==
[[File:Ifasina - Zafimaniry Betsileo village in Madagascar.jpg|thumb|Zafimaniry village]]
Zafimaniry society is comparatively less hierarchical than that of the [[Merina people]].{{sfn|Astuti|Parry|Stafford|2007|p=357}} This has historically manifested as an opposition to centralized government.{{sfn|Breyer|2007|p=86}} They are generally non-violent and place a high degree of value on civility and politeness, as well as gentleness in regards to disciplining children.{{sfn|Bloch|1999|p=178}}

The climate of Zafimaniry country is highland rainforest, where the weather is often cold and damp.{{sfn|Kull|2004|p=151}} The area sits at an altitude of 1,000-1,800 meters and the weather is usually cloudy, resulting in only around 100 rain-free days per year (2,000-3,000&amp;nbsp;mm of rain received annually).{{sfn|Kull|2004|pp=41-42}} The largest Zafimaniry town is Antoetra, with a population of around 1000.&lt;ref name = RButler/&gt; There are 17 larger Zafimaniry villages,{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2014|p=198}} and around 100 in total,&lt;ref name=zafi/&gt; although only Antoetra is accessible by car.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2014|p=198}}

===Family affiliation===
Monogamous marriage and family life are seen as central to the stability of society. The value placed on this vision of family is symbolically represented in the construction and decorations of Zafimaniry homes.{{sfn|Astuti|Parry|Stafford|2007|p=191}} Zafimaniry women tend to marry much earlier than men and become mothers at a young age. By contrast, young men have an extended adolescence during which time they engage in "young men's activities" like hunting and long-distance trading.{{sfn|Bloch|1999|p=182}} Young people's pairings are fluid and even a formal marriage can end without complications; it is the birth of children that serves to cement a relationship.{{sfn|Bloch|1993|p=115}} Parents are considered more successful as adults when they are able to raise a larger number of children. Older family members (''raiamandreny'') are respected leaders in the community and set an example of harmonious communal living by speaking calmly and politely with reference to proverbs and the respect due to ancestors.{{sfn|Bloch|1999|p=180}}

===Class affiliation===
The Zafimaniry historically had a slave class, and although slavery officially ended with French colonization in 1896 (but did not truly end in practice until the mid-1930s),{{sfn|Morris|1980|p=121}} the Zafimaniry still identify descendants of this group as members of the slave class.{{sfn|Morris|1980|p=118}} These members of the slave class, who at most made up 10% of the total population and were generally captives (including foreigners) and disgraced Zafimaniry, were never dispersed throughout Zafimaniry country or owned by individual masters. Rather, they were clustered in just two villages that had a historic role as hosting a sort of court where disputes were resolved,{{sfn|Morris|1980|p=119}} the largest being Antetezandrotra.{{sfn|Morris|1980|p=124}} They served these administrative units by fetching salt from the coast and other such errands but otherwise lived daily lives more or less indistinguishable from the free Zafimaniry. Nonetheless, these two groups do not intermarry.{{sfn|Morris|1980|p=119}} Slaves had no access to land unless it was granted to them by a free Zafimaniry, and this tended to be the exhausted land that free people had allowed to go fallow, where sweet potatoes might still manage to grow.{{sfn|Morris|1980|p=120}}

The free Zafimaniry class is expected to marry other Zafimaniry in order to form social alliances that will provide them with access to new land for cultivation. Since the descendants of slaves could not marry free Zafimaniry to access land, they often choose a spouse from former slave castes in the areas where they migrate for seasonal wage labor. Consequently the descendants of slaves have more relatives outside of Zafimaniry country and are better able to send their children to live with relatives to attend higher quality schools outside Zafimaniry country; the descendants of Zafimaniry slaves are therefore better educated on average than the free Zafimaniry.{{sfn|Morris|1980|p=127}}

===Religious affiliation===
Originally, Zafimaniry culture did not have a well defined religion.{{sfn|Bloch|2010|p=161}} Traditional beliefs revolved around respect for ancestors and for ''Zanahary'', translated by European missionaries as "God", but representing an indifferent and ever-present force akin to fate or destiny, and manifested through the forces of nature.{{sfn|Bloch|1995|p=95}} Beginning in the late 1800s, members of the London Missionary Society began converting free Zafimaniry villages to Protestantism. Jesuit missionaries also conducted heavy outreach to the Zafimaniry in the mid-1930s, particularly including members of the recently freed slave class, who became the primary Catholic converts.{{sfn|Morris|1980|p=122}}

==Culture==
[[File:Zafimaniry house.JPG|thumb|Traditional Zafimaniry wooden house]]
The Zafimaniry are celebrated for their woodworking skills. Their homes are built entirely of wood without using nails. Houses and all other wooden household items including furniture, tombs and tools are decorated with symbolic geometric patterns that blend Arab and Austronesian influences.&lt;ref name = RButler/&gt; Unlike most other ethnic groups in Madagascar, the Zafimaniry place a much greater importance on building houses, rather than tombs, that are durable and well decorated.{{sfn|Bloch|2010|p=151}} Fire is applied to harden wood used for the fabrication of blowpipes and arrows.{{sfn|Domenichini-Ramiaramanana|1983|p=275}} The woodworkers use over 20 types of trees, each with their own specific properties and uses. Their woodworking style was formerly widespread across Madagascar but has largely died out and is now largely preserved only among this ethnic group. In 2008, Zafimaniry woodworking was inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.&lt;ref name=zafi/&gt;

It is also believed that the Zafimaniry have retained other original Malagasy cultural practices and beliefs that have died out in other parts of the island. For example, there is an association between the circumcision ceremony and death; the child to be circumcised is ritualistically measured for his coffin before the operation is carried out.{{sfn|Domenichini-Ramiaramanana|1983|p=465}} They also practice the ancient tradition of erecting tall standing stones to commemorate an ancestor or an important event in the ancestor's life.{{sfn|Nielssen|2011|p=118}}  Traditional clothing was made of beaten bark cloth.{{sfn|Bloch|1993|p=116}}

===Funeral rites===
The dead are entombed in wooden tombs placed in the forest.{{sfn|Morris|1980|p=120}}  Ritualized wrestling matches, which often resemble a form of dance, take place at Zafimaniry funeral ceremonies.{{sfn|Domenichini-Ramiaramanana|1983|p=505}}

===Dance and music===
The ''lokanga'' is a musical instrument much favored among the Zafimaniry. Its shape is symbolic of a coffin.{{sfn|Domenichini-Ramiaramanana|1983|p=465}}

==Language==
The [[Malagasy language]] is spoken by Zafimaniry as it is by the rest of the Malagasy ethnic groups. Their dialect is nearly identical to that of the Betsileo, who border them to the west.{{sfn|Bloch|1995|p=91}}

==Economy==
Historically, all community members were woodworkers. However, heavy deforestation has reduced the availability of wood, diminishing the viability of livelihoods based on this skill. In recent years the Zafimaniry villages have increasingly promoted tourism to generate income, but this new form of livelihood is increasingly changing the nature of the communities who were formerly somewhat secluded.&lt;ref name = RButler&gt;{{cite web | last = Butler | first = Rhett | title = Zafimaniry Villages of the Ambositra in Madagascar |publisher = WildMadagascar.org | url = http://www.wildmadagascar.org/conservation/parks/journal/zafimaniry-ambositra.html | year = 2008 | accessdate = 22 February 2017 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism allows them to sell wooden carved handicrafts to passing hikers,{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2014|p=199}} and they also sell these items to suppliers who resell them in larger towns like nearby [[Ambositra]].&lt;ref name=zafi/&gt; The Catholic former slave class largely monopolized the sale of wooden handicrafts to tourists until the 1970s because the mass production of these items was first organized by local Catholic converts with support from the church; although most Zafimaniry are now involved in this sector, the Catholic ex-slaves still dominate in terms of production, distribution and sale. Zafimaniry also harvest wood from the forest for sale.  Most tour guides who organize tourist visits to Zafimaniry villages are from the former slave village of Antetezandrotra.{{sfn|Morris|1980|pp=123-124}}

The Zafimaniry primarily grow maize and beans and have been traditionally reliant on ''tavy'' (slash-and-burn agriculture).&lt;ref name = RButler/&gt; The average Zafimaniry man spends 22 days a year on clearing agricultural land through tavy, while the remainder of his time can be dedicated to other income earning activities like wood carving or migrating to find seasonal work elsewhere.{{sfn|Kull|2004|p=152}} Maize, which was probably adopted by the Zafimaniry around 200 years ago, is now their staple crop. Fields are burned each year at the start of the planting season, and are cultivated for four to ten years before their fertility is depleted and they are left fallow for around five years before being planted again. As a field becomes less fertile, maize and bean cultivation is abandoned in favor of potatoes and sweet potatoes. Cassava is the last crop to be grown in a field before it is allowed to go fallow During the fallow period, the Zafimaniry use the fields for other purposes, such as for grazing cattle, growing medicinal plants, and growing non-food plants, bushes and trees for fibers and construction material.{{sfn|Kull|2004|p=151}} After seventy years of this fertile-fallow cycle, the Zafimaniry stop cultivating the land plot entirely and allow it to become permanently fallow pasture land.{{sfn|Kull|2004|p=160}}  They supplement their corn, taro and beans with wild products gathered in the surrounding forests, particularly including honey and crayfish.{{sfn|Morris|1980|p=118}}

Recent efforts to introduce intensified crop production with an emphasis on rice grown year after year in the same field, have been somewhat successful.&lt;ref name = RButler/&gt; Rice cultivation in this historically cold region has been made easier in recent decades due to global warming.{{sfn|Bloch|1995|p=90}} This is largely due to the exhaustion of Zafimaniry land for traditional swidden agriculture, which has forced the Zafimaniry to find a way to adopt rice cultivation despite the unadapted nature of the mountainous terrain where they live. The terrain and climate require highly complex terracing and irrigation systems that the local population lacks the knowledge to build, so they are required to hire Betsileo specialists to construct their paddies. Most cash income the Zafimaniry use is invested in the construction of terraces for rice cultivation.{{sfn|Morris|1980|p=124}}
