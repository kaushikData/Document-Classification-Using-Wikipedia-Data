'''Alfred Poling''' (born January 22, 1957) better known by the [[ring name]] '''911''', is an American retired [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], best known for his time with [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) between 1994 and 1996.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career===
Poling was trained as a wrestler by [[Larry Sharpe (wrestler) | Larry Sharpe]]. He debuted in 1990, wrestling on the [[independent circuit]] under the [[ring name]] "Al the Sledgehammer".&lt;ref name="iwatapings1990"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1softball.com/WBS/WrestlingBookingSheet291.htm |title=The Wrestling Booking Sheet - Issue #291 |first=Steve |last=Appenrodt |date=1999-08-30 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ytiwasledgehammer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7gHi_sgkAw |title=IWA Championship Wrestling - Derrick Dukes vs Al The Sledgehammer |first=Rob |last=Russen |year=1990 |accessdate=2013-08-30|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994-1996)===
Poling achieved his greatest national exposure in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|Eastern Championship Werstling]] (ECW) in the mid-1990s. He debuted in ECW as an unnamed "handler" to [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] on the January 18, 1994 episode of ''[[ECW Hardcore TV|Eastern Championship Wrestling]]'' by defeating [[Chad Slivenski|Chad Austin]]. He joined [[Paul Heyman]]'s [[Dangerous Alliance]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#stable|stable]] with Sabu and [[Tazz|The Tazmaniac]]. His [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]] was as an enforcer of the "extreme" attitude; he was named '''911''' at ''The Night The Line was Crossed'' on February 5, where he defeated Chad Austin in a rematch. As part of his monstrous persona, he would frequently perform the [[chokeslam]] on others with little provocation, which made him quickly [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#over|popular]] with the crowd as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/11/24/pf-729421.html|title=SLAM! Speaks: What we miss about ECW|author=SLAM Wrestling staff|publisher=SLAM Wrestling|accessdate=February 16, 2015|date=November 25, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his first title shot in ECW at ''When Worlds Collide'', where he challenged [[Mikey Whipwreck]] for the [[ECW World Television Championship|ECW Television Championship]] but got disqualified after chokeslamming the [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]].  He would then enter a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|rivalry]] with [[Curtis Hughes|Mr. Hughes]], whom he defeated at [[Hardcore Heaven (1994)|Hardcore Heaven]]. On August 27, at the [[NWA World Title Tournament]], 911 participated in the [[ECW tournaments#NWA World Heavyweight Championship Tournament|namesake tournament]] for the vacant [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], where he defeated [[Doink the Clown]] in the quarter-final after four chokeslams, before losing to [[2 Cold Scorpio]] in the semi-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hardcore History: The Extremely Unauthorized Story of ECW|author=Williams, Scott E.|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc|year=2013|chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He closed the year by defeating [[The Pitbulls]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|handicap match]] at [[Holiday Hell (1994)|Holiday Hell]]. Poling received the ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]'' [[PWI Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] award due to his enormous popularity in ECW for the year 1994.

Poling had two big matches in 1995, scoring wins over [[Ron Simmons]] at [[Hostile City Showdown (1995)|Hostile City Showdown]] and [[Jim Steele (wrestler)|Jim Steele]] at ''Barbed Wire, Hoodies and Chokeslams''. At the [[House Party (1996)|1996 House Party]] [[List of ECW supercards and pay-per-view events|event]], 911 teamed with [[Rey Mysterio|Rey Misterio, Jr.]] to defeat [[The Eliminators]] in a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types|tag team match]], which would turn out to be his last match in ECW. He got involved in a brawl with [[Tazz|Taz]] after the match and a feud evolved between the two, but it was scrapped as Poling left the promotion by early 1996 after a falling out backstage with Paul Heyman over the former's treatment of the ring crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hardcore History: The Extremely Unauthorized Story of ECW|author=Williams, Scott E.|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc|year=2013|chapter=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===World Championship Wrestling (1996-1997)===
Poling wrestled in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in 1996 and 1997, under the names Tombstone,&lt;ref name="nt19961223"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= WCW Monday Nitro|series= WCW Monday Nitro|serieslink= WCW Monday Nitro|station= TNT (TV channel)|airdate= 1996-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sledge Hammer&lt;ref name="sn19970215"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= WCW Saturday Night|series= WCW Saturday Night|serieslink= WCW Saturday Night|station= TBS (TV channel)|airdate= 1997-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Big Al.&lt;ref name="sn19970111"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= WCW Saturday Night|series= WCW Saturday Night|serieslink= WCW Saturday Night|station= TBS (TV channel)|airdate= 1997-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sn19970412"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= WCW Saturday Night|series= WCW Saturday Night|serieslink= WCW Saturday Night|station= TBS (TV channel)|airdate= 1997-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sn19970510"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= WCW Saturday Night|series= WCW Saturday Night|serieslink= WCW Saturday Night|station= TBS (TV channel)|airdate= 1997-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poling did not portray the Big Al who feuded with [[Tank Abbott]] in WCW in early 2000.

===Return to ECW===
In 1998, Poling returned to ECW at [[UltraClash (1998)|UltraClash]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, [[chokeslam]]ming [[Bill Wiles]]. Poling was then accompanied by manager Judge Jeff Jones, who proclaimed 911 to be the true giant of professional wrestling. They were then interrupted by [[Spike Dudley]] and had an [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#impromptu match|impromptu match]], which 911 lost in [[Squash (professional wrestling)|under a minute]].

===Independent circuit===
Throughout the late 1990s, 911 appeared with the [[New Jersey]] based [[Jersey All Pro Wrestling]] promotion, winning the [[JAPW Heavyweight Championship]] on two occasions. He made an appearance at [[Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling]] ''A War Renewed'' on June 29th, 2002 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, interfering on the behalf of [[Tod Gordon]] and [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]], delivering a chokeslam to [[Sandman (wrestler)|Sandman]] (who had just been betrayed by his partner, [[Bill Alfonso]]). At ''[[Hardcore Homecoming]]'' in 2005 he chokeslammed both [[Danny Doring]] and [[Roadkill (wrestler)|Roadkill]].&lt;ref name=oww/&gt; He wrestled at New York Wrestling League in 2008.

In [[Hawaiian mythology]], '''ʻAikanaka''' (or '''ʻAi Kanaka''', '''ʻAikane''') is a [[Human|mortal]] chief who married [[Lona (mythology)|Lona]], the [[moon goddess]]. They lived happily together in her palace until he died of old age.&lt;ref&gt;''Pacific mythology: an encyclopedia of myth and legend'' by [[Jan Knappert]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Academic Dictionary Of Mythology'' by [[Ramesh Chopra]]&lt;/ref&gt;

His name means "man eater".

ʻAikanaka also married [[hina (goddess)|Hinahanaiakamalama]] (according to the Ulu [[genealogy]]). She bore him sons [[Hemā (mythology)|Hemā]] and Puna.&lt;ref&gt;E.R. Tregear, Maori-Polynesian Comparative Dictionary (Lyon and Blair: Lambton Quay), 1891.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Lona and Hinahanaiakamalama are [[lunar deity|lunar goddesses]], so it is likely that they are the same person, and ʻAikanaka is married to just one woman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha Warren Beckwith]], pp. 214-25&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ulu genealogy, ʻAikanaka was born ca. 746.

'''Al pastor''' (from [[Spanish language|Spanish]], "shepherd style"), also known as '''tacos al pastor''', is a dish developed in central Mexico that is based on [[shawarma]] spit-grilled [[meat]] brought by [[Lebanese immigration to Mexico|Lebanese immigrants to Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;David Sterling, "The Lebanese Connection," ''Yucatan: A Culinary Expedition''. http://www.los-dos.com/culinary-expedition/verarticulo.php?IdArticulo=258&lt;/ref&gt; Being derived from shawarma, it is also similar to the Turkish [[döner kebab]] and the Greek [[Gyro (food)|gyros]]. In contrast to döner kebab and shawarma however, tacos al pastor are pork based. In some places of northern Mexico, as in [[Baja California]], this [[taco]] is called '''taco de [[adobada]]'''. A similar dish from [[Puebla]] with different spices is '''tacos árabes'''.&lt;ref name="Peterson 2015"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://la.eater.com/2015/3/26/8294151/tacos-arabes-boyle-heights-taco-truck-review-photos |title=These Massive Tacos Árabes in Boyle Heights Pack a Punch |last=Peterson |first=Lucas |date=26 March 2015 |website=[[Eater.com]] LA |access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Dönerci, 1855.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The earliest known photo of meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie, aka [[Doner kebab|döner]], by [[James Robertson (photographer)|James Robertson]], 1855, [[Ottoman Empire]]]]

A wave of mainly Christian [[Lebanese Mexicans|Lebanese immigration to Mexico]] took place in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the 1960s, Mexican-born progeny of Lebanese immigrants began opening their own restaurants and combining their heritage with Mexican cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-05-07/thank-ottoman-empire-taco-youre-eating|title=Thank the Ottoman Empire for the taco al pastor|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Grilling a vertical spit of stacked meat slices and cutting it off as it cooks was developed in the 19th century in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkey]].&lt;ref name="Zeit 1996-05-10"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zeit.de/1996/20/Doener-Fieber_sogar_in_Hoyerswerda |title=Döner-Fieber sogar in Hoyerswerda |author=Eberhard Seidel-Pielen |date=May 10, 1996 |website=ZEIT ONLINE |publisher= |language=German |trans-title=Doner fever even in Hoyerswerda |accessdate=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kiple"&gt;Kenneth F. Kiple, Kriemhild Coneè Ornelas, eds., ''Cambridge World History of Food'', Cambridge, 2000. {{ISBN|0-521-40216-6}}. Vol. 2, p. 1147&lt;/ref&gt; This is [[döner kebab]], which is the origin of tacos al pastor, Middle Eastern [[shawarma]], and Greek [[gyros]].

==Preparation==
[[Pork]] is marinated in a combination of dried [[Chili pepper|chilies]], [[spice]]s and [[pineapple]]. In some places, [[achiote]] is also added, and then slowly cooked with a gas flame on a vertical [[rotisserie]] called a ''trompo'' (lit: [[Top|spinning top]]), very similar to how shawarma is cooked, with a piece of fresh onion and a pineapple on top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mexconnect.com/mex_/recipes/puebla/kgtacos2.html|title=Wrap It Up: A Guide To Mexican Street Tacos - Part 2: Nighttime Tacos : Mexico Cuisine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ready, the meat is then thinly sliced off the spit with a large knife. It is served on small [[tortilla]]s, with finely chopped [[onion]]s, [[cilantro]], and occasionally a small slice of pineapple, and usually topped with some [[lemon]] or [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] juice and hot [[Salsa (sauce)|salsa]]. This meat is a common ingredient in not just [[taco]]s, but also [[gringas]], [[alambre]]s, [[Huarache (food)|huaraches]], [[torta]]s, [[burrito]]s and [[pizza]].

[[file:01 Tacos al Pastor.jpg|Plate of tacos al pastor|thumb|left]]

==Varieties==
In some places of northern Mexico, such as [[Nuevo León]], [[Durango]] and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], these are usually called ''tacos de trompo'' if served on [[corn tortilla]]s, and ''[[gringas]]'' if they are served with cheese on [[wheat tortilla]]s.

A similar dish is called ''tacos árabes'', which originated in [[Puebla]] in the 1930s from [[Arab Mexican]] cuisine. Tacos árabes use shawarma-style meat carved from a spit, but are served in a [[pita]]-style bread called ''pan árabe''. These tacos have been brought by [[Mexican Americans|Mexican immigrants to the United States]] in the past few years and have become popular in cities, such as Chicago and Los Angeles, two of the largest Mexican/Mexican-American population centers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;David Hammond, "Perfection on a Spit," ''Chicago Reader'', November 8, 2007.http://www.chicagoreader.com/features/stories/restaurants/071108/&lt;/ref&gt;

A non-pork version featuring chicken marinated in the "al pastor" style was brought "back" to the Middle East in the early 2000s, and sold as "shawarma mexici". It is essentially a chicken shawarma made in the Middle Eastern style (wrapped with garlic mayonnaise, [[dill pickle]], and [[french fries]] in a thin [[flatbread]]).

==Claude==
[[File:Claude Askew in Serbian uniform.jpg|thumb|left|Claude Askew in Serbian uniform, unsigned photograph, c. 1916]]

Claude was born on 27 November 1865 at No. 4 Holland Park, Kensington in London and christened '''Claude Arthur Cary'''. He was the second son and youngest of five children of Fanny Georgiana Charlotte Askew (née Browne 1830–1900) and Rev. John Askew, M.A. (1804–1881).&lt;ref name="hisbirth" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 2 December 1865, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Claude's older sisters and brother were: Amy Ellen Cary Askew (10 June 1857 – 29 April 1945), Isabel Emily Florence Askew (16 November 1858 – 30 October 1928), Mabel Fanny Mary Askew (23 February 1861 – 21 August 1941), and Hugh Henry John Percy Cary Askew (18 September 1862 – 14 April 1949).

Claude was educated at Eton College (1879–1883), "... and there wrote a play in blank verse...." &lt;ref name="Adrian" /&gt; It was probably during this period — certainly after 1877 and before 1883 — when Claude was taken on a holiday to [[Vevey]] (between [[Montreux]] and [[Lausanne]]) on [[Lake Geneva]], where he met the future King [[Peter I of Serbia]] – then in exile in [[Geneva]]. "I was a small boy, spending my holidays with my people at Vevy on the Lake of Geneva, and at the hotel we struck up an acquaintance with Prince [[Peter I of Serbia|Peter Karageorgevitch]].  He was then in the prime of life, tall, dark, handsome—not yet married." He wrote this many years later recalling this childhood encounter when he met up with him once more – this time with his wife Alice and during the much darker circumstances of the 'Great Serbian Retreat' during [[World War I]] (see below). "At Koshumlja to-day we saw the King. Curiously enough, this was the first time that I have come across him since I have been in [[Serbia]], though Alice has seen him at [[Topola]]. He is a fine old man, and neither trouble, sickness, nor age has bowed him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=186–187|last1=Askew|first1=Alice|last2=Askew|first2=Claude|title=The Stricken Land: Serbia As We Saw It|date=1916|publisher=Dodd, Mead|location=New York|url=http://theworldwar.pastperfect-online.com/35156cgi/mweb.exe?request=record;id=202D36BA-466F-4FE6-98B2-983262855500;type=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Stricken Land: Serbia As We Saw It|url=https://archive.org/details/strickenlandserb00aske|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alice==
Alice was born on 18 June 1874 at No. 3 Westbourne Street, near Hyde Park in London, England; and christened '''Alice Jane de Courcy''' on 5 August 1874 at the church of St. Michael and All Angels in Paddington, London. She was the eldest daughter of Jane Leake (née Dashwood 1844–1912) and Henry Leake (1829–1899), who following his retirement from the British army, was granted the honorary rank of Lt-Colonel.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 20 June 1874, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 11 January 1882, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of her birth he was a Captain, on half pay, late of the [[70th (Surrey) Regiment of Foot]]. She had two younger siblings: Henry Dashwood Stucley Leake (17 Feb 1876 – 2 June 1970),&lt;ref&gt;GRO Birth certificate – registered 25 April 1876&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Certified Copy of an Entry of Death – General Register Office (GRO) – registered 2 June 1970&lt;/ref&gt; and Frances Beatrice Levine Leake (27 May 1878 – 29 Aug 1884).&lt;ref&gt;GRO Birth certificate – registered 22 June 1874&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GRO Death certificate – registered 30 August 1884&lt;/ref&gt;

She began writing "for her own amusement" before her marriage, did have one short story published under her own name alone (or rather initials), "A. J. de C. L." = '''Alice Jane de Courcy Leake''': 'A Modern-Day Saint', which appeared in 1894 in ''[[Belgravia (magazine)|Belgravia]]'' of London.&lt;ref name=Adrian /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Belgravia'': A London Magazine, Volume 85 (September to December 1894), London: F.V. White &amp; Co., 14, Bedford Street, Strand, W.C.,1894, pp. 279–287.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and partnership==
Alice and Claude were married on 10 July 1900, at Christ Church, Lancaster Gate, London.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 13 July 1900, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Certified Copy of an Entry of Marriage – General Register Office (GRO)&lt;/ref&gt;
:A PICTURESQUE WEDDING:  “There was a large and fashionable congregation on Tuesday afternoon at Christ Church, Lancaster Gate, to witness the marriage of Mr. Claude Arthur Cary Askew, second son of the late Rev. John Askew, M.A., to Miss Alice Jane de Courcey Leake, only surviving daughter of the late Lieut.-Colonel Henry Leake, late 44th and 70th Regiments, and of Mrs. Leake, 3, Westbourne Street, Hyde Park.  The bridegroom, who is the proprietor of the Anglo-American Exchange, of London, New York, and Paris, has a host of friends and acquaintances among American visitors now in London, many of whom were present at the ceremony. ....” &lt;ref&gt;Newspaper clipping with neither the name of the newspaper nor the date it was published, under the heading: A PICTURESQUE WEDDING. "This clipping is among the family artifacts now in my possession – previously in that of my aunt, Alice Askew's youngest child, G.M.A." —R.C.A.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after their marriage, Alice and Claude Askew began writing together and the first novel under their joint names, ''[[The Shulamite]],'' was published in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Alice &amp; Claude Askew, ''The Shulamite'', Chapman &amp; Hall, London, 1904&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards Claude, together with [[Edward Knoblock]], wrote a stage adaptation of it, which was first produced in 1906 at the [[Savoy Theatre]], London starring [[Lena Ashwell]], and a little later with Miss Ashwell in the same role in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', 3 June 1906 'The Stage Abroad'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, A.E.: ''Edwardian Theatre'', Arthur Barker Ltd., London, 1951, pp. 119, 154&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 Paramount Pictures produced a silent film version with the title ''[[Under the Lash]]'' starring [[Gloria Swanson]], and directed by [[Sam Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0012790/ ''Under the Lash'' at IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple went on to publish "a large number of novels and serial stories".&lt;ref name=death /&gt;

[[File:Alice Askew in Serbian nurse's uniform.jpg|thumb|200px|left|alt=A|Alice Askew in Serbian nurse's uniform, unsigned photograph, c. 1916.]]

In 1915, during the First World War, both Alice and Claude Askew traveled to [[Serbia]] as part of a relief effort with a British field hospital that would be attached to the Second Serbian Army. They were also Special Correspondents for the British newspaper ''[[Daily Express]]''. As Claude himself describes their role: "As for Alice and myself, we went out essentially as writers, though we were prepared to turn our hands to odd jobs if called upon to do so.  We had assisted Dr. Hartnell Beavis in London with the formation of the unit, the raising of funds, and the collection of stores. It was the reports in the English Press of the terrible state into which Serbia had fallen during the winter of 1914–1915 that first inspired us to work for that gallant little country."  He wrote this in their personal account of their experiences and impressions accompanying the Serbian army on its famous 'Great Retreat' across the mountains from [[Prishtina]] to [[Lezhë|Alessio]], during the winter of 1915–16, which was published in 1916 under the title: ''The Stricken Land: Serbia As We Saw It.''&lt;ref&gt;Askew, 1916, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The authors had spent some six months in Serbia before the retreat and wrote with sympathy and real knowledge of Serbia and the Serbian character.&lt;ref name=death /&gt; Claude Askew  was given the honorary commission of a major in the Serbian army.&lt;ref&gt;Askew, 1916, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 'Great Serbian Retreat' (see: [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|Serbian Campaign]]), when the bulk of the Serbian army had been evacuated to the Greek island of [[Corfu]], Alice and Claude both returned to England, which they reached by April 1916. By sometime in May, after finishing and arranging the publication of ''The Stricken Land'', Claude was back with the Serbian army – now at Salonika (as [[Thessaloniki]] was then called in English), where he was working out of its Press Bureau.  But Alice remained in London to give birth to her third child, who was born towards the end of July 1916.  She was also spending the time in England soliciting support for the relief work with Serbia.  But in October she also returned to the theatre of war and was with her husband Claude in Salonika until about the end of April of the following year, when she went to Corfu to work with the Serbian Red Cross there, under Colonel Borissavljevitch.&lt;ref&gt;Letter, dated 22 March 1917, which Claude Askew wrote to his niece in London, with the return address: "Press Bureau, Headquarters, Serbian army, Salonica", in which he wrote: "Alice left this part of the world about three weeks ago.  She has gone to Corfu where she is busy working for Colonel Borissavljevitch, President of the Serbian Red Cross – her address is care of him.  I was anxious for her, in those days of submarines, until I heard she had safely arrived – that was by telegram – I have no letter from her yet, but it takes as long for a letter to get here from Corfu as from England.  If I can get leave, which is very doubtful, I may join her later on for a month, but one cannot see into the future and all sorts of things may happen out here." "This letter is among the family artifacts now in my possession – previously in that of G.M.A." —R.C.A.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Alice askew grave.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Alice Askew's tombstone]]

Sometime between at least September and October 1917, Alice and Claude were on leave in Italy – perhaps in Rome to meet up with their two older children.&lt;ref&gt;Letter, dated 19 July 1917, which Alice Askew wrote to her friend, Miss Mildred Watson in London, with the return address (in French):"Care of Colonel Borissavljevitch, President Serbian Red Cross, Corfu", in which she wrote: "I am hoping to see Geoffrey &amp; Joan, last October makes it nearly nine months since I saw the children &amp; I am longing to have them with me for a month. I have been given a month’s leave to go to Rome in the hope of meeting them there." "This letter is among the family artifacts now in my possession – previously in that of G.M.A." —R.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; Then they set out to return to Corfu. During the night of 5–6 October 1917 (or possibly the 4th) when they were traveling on the Italian steamer ''Città di Bari'' from [[Taranto]] to Corfu, it suffered a torpedo attack by the German submarine, [[SM UB-48]] "about 37 miles from Paxo" (or [[Paxoi]]) and was sunk.&lt;ref name=news /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pietrigrandeguerra.it/voci-e-volti-dal-fronte-2/affondamenti-navi-grande-guerra-1917-1918/ Affondamenti navi Grande Guerra 1917-1918] Web site on Italian ships sunk during the First World War - this page covering the period 1917-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavocedelmarinaio.com/2016/10/4-10-1917-il-triste-epilogo-del-piroscafo-citta-di-bari/ '4.10.1917, il triste epilogo del piroscafo Città di Bari'] Web site in Italian containing the story by Prof. Giovanni Vernì – LA VERA STORIA del triste epilogo del piroscafo “Città di Bari”, silurato dal SMG tedesco UB48 - "The True Story" of the sinking of the ''Città di Bari'' including the recollections of a survivor.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/1286.html Ships hit during WWI - Citta Di Bari] Web site on "all the German U-boats of both World Wars" - this page showing the ''Città di Bari'' as one of the ships hit during WWI.&lt;/ref&gt; Both drowned in the incident.&lt;ref name=death /&gt;&lt;ref name=probate /&gt; Claude's body was never recovered, but on 29 October the body of a woman was "found on the seashore at Porto Karboni on the island of [[Korčula]]" by a local fisherman. The next day it was examined by the authorities and, from various letters and telegrams that were found about her person, identified as that of the "well-known English lady writer Alice Askew of London."&lt;ref&gt;Translation of an original document sent "To the Imperial Royal District Authorities (Bezirkshauptmannschaft), Korčula (Curzola), Velaluka, 6 November 1917 ...

"This English translation and what appears to be the original document, hand-written (in Croatian), signed and sealed – or possibly an equally hand-written, signed and sealed copy of it – are among the family artifacts now in my possession – previously in that of G.M.A." —R.C.A.&lt;/ref&gt; Alice Askew was then buried that same day 30 October 1917 at Porto Karboni. And a stone cross was erected there, bearing the following inscription: ALICE ASKEW / {{smallcaps|englezka spisateljica / donesena morem 29 / a pokopana / komissionalno / 30 oktobra 1917}} - (roughly translated from the original Croatian: "ALICE ASKEW / English writer / delivered up from the sea 29 / and buried / by commission / 30 October 1917").&lt;ref&gt;Fazinić, Neven ing., Korčula, Croatia: ''Kameni Križevi Na Otoku Korčuli'' (Stone crosses on the island of Korčula) – article with photographs, dated 06.10.2006, that was originally accessed on [http://www.ikorcula.net/korcula_info/prikazi/kameni-krizevi-na-otoku-korculi.htm ikorcula.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously – on 21 October 1917, a memorial service for Alice and Claude Askew was held at the Serbian Church in Corfu, attended by a large number of both Serbian and British officials. It was conducted by the Archbishop of Serbia, "who paid an eloquent and touching tribute to the benevolent work of Major and Mrs. Askew, to whom, he said, the Serbian people owed eternal gratitude".&lt;ref&gt;"Imperial and Foreign News Items" in ''[[The Times]]'', 23 October 1917, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alice and Claude Askew were survived by one son and two daughters.

'''Antonio de Marco Soto''' (born January 7, 1986), best known as '''Antonio''' "'''Tony'''" '''DeMarco''', is a Mexican [[professional boxer]] who held the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[lightweight]] title from 2011 to 2012. He is a cousin of former two-weight world champion [[Humberto Soto]].&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright, Anson (2011).

==Professional career==

===Lightweight===
DeMarco claimed an interim belt after he dominated [[Jose Alfaro]] for 10 rounds before a stoppage was called. Demarco won every round before dropping Alfaro three times in the 10th round. Demarco's unbeaten streak is 15-0-1 with 10 knockouts, including 12 consecutive wins, since losing a six-round, majority decision to Anthony Vasquez in February 2006. He lined himself up to face the monster-punching full WBC titlist, [[Edwin Valero]].&lt;ref&gt;Christ, Scott. (2011-08-31) [http://www.badlefthook.com/2009/10/31/1109416/antonio-demarco-dominates-jose Antonio DeMarco dominates Jose Alfaro, stops him in 10]. Bad Left Hook. Retrieved on 2009-08-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

DeMarco's first chance at being world champion was unsuccessful after he was stopped by the late [[Edwin Valero]] of [[Venezuela]] to retain his WBC Lightweight belt. After absorbing 9 rounds of punishment, DeMarco's trainer advised the referee to stop the fight. DeMarco later stated, “I'm a Mexican fighter, I never wanted to quit but my trainer saw that Edwin was just a better fighter.” When the fight ended, Valero was eight points up on the scorecards of all three judges.&lt;ref&gt;http://ringtv.craveonline.com/blog/122905-valero-stops-demarco-looks-to-bigger-and-better-challenges-&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael, Dan.

DeMarco rebounded with a second-round TKO victory over Daniel Attah. In his following fight, he defeated Reyes Sanchez by unanimous decision to win the WBC Silver Lightweight title.

===WBC lightweight champion===
On October 15, 2011, DeMarco stopped former two division champion [[Jorge Linares]] in the 11th round to claim the vacant [[List of lightweight boxing champions#WBC|WBC Lightweight title]].

On September 8, 2012, Demarco stepped into the ring to make his second world title defense against John Molina, Jr. In round 1 DeMarco landed his straight left hand onto Molina's face and sent Molina back. As DeMarco had Molina hurt and up against the ropes, the referee jumped in and called a stop to the bout, only 44 seconds into the fight.

===Light welterweight===

====DeMarco vs. Vargas====
On November 22, 2014, Antonio DeMarco attempted to win his third world title in the junior welterweight division. DeMarco faced former olympian and current (Regular) [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Junior Welterweight Champion [[Jesse Vargas]]. This fight took place at [[The Venetian Macao]] in [[Macau]], [[Special Administrative Regions|SAR]] on the undercard of [[Manny Pacquiao vs. Chris Algieri]] on HBO PPV.

'''Walter Archibald Annan''' (23 March 1877 – 1949) was a Scottish professional [[association football|footballer]] in the years prior to [[World War I]]. A [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full back]], he made over 170 appearances in [[the Football League]].&lt;ref name="Joyce"&gt;{{cite book |   first=Michael|last=Joyce |   title=Football League Players' Records 1888 – 1939|   publisher=Tony Brown |   year=2004|   isbn=1-899468-67-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He featured prominently in [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]]'s successes in the first decade of the 20th century under manager [[Harry Thickett]]. He also played for [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], and [[Port Vale F.C.|Burslem Port Vale]]. He helped Bristol City to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title in 1905–06, a second-place finish in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1906–07, and also played in the [[FA Cup]] final in [[1909 FA Cup Final|1909]].

==Career==
Born in [[Carnwath]], [[Lanarkshire]],&lt;ref name="census"/&gt; he was the youngest of 13 children&lt;ref name="Special pact"/&gt; born to Walter Annan, a colliery manager, and his wife Marion (''née'' Storry).&lt;ref name="birth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1881 Scotland Census&lt;/ref&gt; A lifelong [[Teetotalism|teetotal]]ler,&lt;ref name="Special pact"/&gt; Annan joined local club West Calder in August 1899, before moving onto Edinburgh club [[St Bernard's F.C.|St Bernard's]] in May 1900. No Scottish league appearances are recorded for either club.&lt;ref name="DykesLamming"&gt;{{cite book|first=Garth|last=Dykes|first2=Doug |last2=Lamming|title=All the Lads Complete Who's Who of Sunderland AFC|publisher=Polar|year=1999|isbn=1-899538-14-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1902 he moved to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] of [[the Football League]]. He made a solitary appearance at right back in 2–1 win over [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] on 4 April 1903, in a season when Sunderland finished third, only a single point behind champions [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].&lt;ref name="DykesLamming" /&gt; In January 1904 he moved on to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], and made his league debut for the "Blades" at left back in a 2–0 defeat at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 9 January 1904. He made a total of nine appearances at full back, deputising for [[Harry Thickett]] and Boyle in [[1903–04 Football League|1903–04]]. Annan made 18 appearances in [[1904–05 Football League|1904–05]], as United finished sixth in the First Division.

Annan followed manager Harry Thickett to [[Ashton Gate Stadium|Ashton Gate]] for £200 in April 1905.&lt;ref name="WoodsEdwards"&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Woods|first2=Leigh |last2=Edwards |title=Bristol City FC The First 100 years|publisher=Redcliffe Press |year=1997|isbn=1-900178-26-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] finished as [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] champions in [[1905–06 Football League|1905–06]], Annan was ever-present with 38 appearances at right-back, and formed a notable defensive full back partnership with [[Joe Cottle]]. Ever present again for a second successive season in [[1906–07 Football League|1906–07]], City finished the campaign as runners-up in the First Division. Annan played just 13 games in [[1907–08 Football League|1907–08]] as new signing [[Bob Young (footballer, born 1886)|Bob Young]] was preferred at right-back. In [[1908–09 Football League|1908–09]], Annan replaced Young as the regular right-back, making 26 appearances and playing in all 10 [[FA Cup]] ties, including the [[1909 FA Cup Final]] – City lost the final 1–0 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|Crystal Palace]]. He made a further 28 appearances in [[1909–10 Football League|1909–10]], and was again replaced by Bob Young in the later stages of the season. Annan did not feature in the City team in the [[1910–11 Football League|1910–11]] season, as Bristol City were relegated back to the Second Division.&lt;ref name="Woods"&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Woods|title=Bristol Babe The First 100 years of Bristol City FC|publisher=Yore Publications |year=1994|isbn=1-874427-95-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final league match of the season, a 1–0 defeat to Everton on 29 April 1911, was awarded as a joint benefit for [[Arthur Spear]] and Archie Annan, although neither played in the game.&lt;ref name="WoodsEdwards"/&gt;

In July 1911, Annan moved onto [[Port Vale F.C.|Burslem Port Vale]].&lt;ref name="kent"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Jeff|title=Port Vale Personalities|publisher=Witan Books|page=7|year=1996|isbn=0-9529152-0-0|id= {{ASIN|0952915200|country=ca}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut at the [[Athletic Ground (Cobridge)|Athletic Ground]] in a 1–0 win over [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic Reserves]] on 4 September, but injured himself in a match against [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] twelve days later.&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt; He failed to hold onto his first team place upon his recovery, and was released at the end of the [[1911–12 in English football|1911–12]] season, after picking up a Central League runners-up medal.&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt;

Annan was appointed manager of Welsh [[Southern Football League]] club [[Mid Rhondda F.C.|Mid Rhondda]] in July 1911, where he was assisted by former Bristol City colleagues Joe Cottle and [[Bill Demmery]]. He subsequently returned to Bristol City in March 1921 and spent five years as coach at the club. He was later a police constable stationed at St George in [[Bristol]].&lt;ref name="WoodsEdwards"/&gt;

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] affirms the prospect of '''life after death''' extensively while not defining everything about it. The [[soul]] on death is said to recognize the value of its deeds and begin a new phase of a conscious relationship with God though negative experiences are possible. Others have noted the religion's stances on the [[afterlife]].

== Death, dying, the soul and the afterlife ==

===Teachings and beliefs===
The [[soul]] is not considered to be subject to natural law - rather it is subject to spiritual law as a covenant between man and God and it takes identity at the conception of the embryo, but not "in" the body, rather, associated with it like light to a mirror.&lt;ref name="Abib"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Taherzadeh, Adib |authorlink= Adib Taherzadeh |year= 1976 |title= The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, Volume 1 |publisher= George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK|isbn= 0-85398-270-8| url =http://www.peyman.info/cl/Bahá'í/Others/ROB/V1/p071-083Ch06.html#p72 |pages = 72–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heaven]] is a soul being close to God, not a place but a condition, as it undergoes an eternal spiritual evolution.&lt;ref name="hatcher1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hatcher | first = John S.|title =How Different Religions View Death and Afterlife | editor-last = Johnson | editor-first =Christopher J. |editor2-last = McGee |editor2-first =Marsha G.|publisher =The Charles Press | edition =2nd| origyear = 1986 | year = 2009|pages = 14–30, also Q&amp;A pp. 266–300 |chapter = Bahá'í Faith (2nd chapter) | chapterurl = | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=pvHgQAAACAAJ | isbn = 9780914783855}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone who learns and applies virtues and guidance of God "goes to" heaven. [[Hell]] is similarly being far from God, not a place, but of failing to understand and apply virtues and guidance from God. Progress from even the worst condition is possible even in the next world but not until the individual fundamentally overcomes rejecting Godly virtues. Labels we call ourselves by and theologies we claim to adhere to are not as important as the reality of spiritual virtues like courage, justice, love, understanding, etc., actually expressed by choice in our lives.&lt;ref name="hatcher1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Musmumian1"&gt;{{cite book | title =The Handbook of Near-Death Experiences: Thirty Years of Investigation | editor-last = Holden | editor-first =Janice Miner |editor2-last = Greyson |editor2-first =Bruce| editor3-last = James |editor3-first = Debbie| publisher =Greenwood Publishing Group | date =Jun 22, 2009 | pages = 159–183 | chapter =World Religions and Near-Death Experiences | chapterurl =| last = Masumian | first = Farnaz | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=9MdUPgAACAAJ | isbn = 978-0-313-35864-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of the spiritual life reaches a milestone whether in this life or the next in developing the "spirit of faith"&lt;ref name="Abib" /&gt; a gift of the Holy Spirit, which then continues to grow in the individual's soul. But if our ability to express Godly virtues is conditional so is our condition in the afterlife - there is a spectrum of achievement so a purgatory-like environment is possible for those who have not well embraced Godly virtues and those that have not largely rejected them. Indeed, the next world's life is sometimes delineated in stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Stockman| first = Robert | title =Heaven | work =Draft of The Bahá'í Encyclopedia| publisher =Bahai-Library.com | url =http://bahai-library.com/stockman_heaven| accessdate = 2013-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Momen| first = Moojan | title ='Abdu'l-Bahá's Commentary on the Qur'ánic Verses Concerning the Overthrow of the Byzantines: The Stages of the Soul | journal = Lights of Irfan; Papers Presented at the ‘Irfán Colloquia and Seminars | volume =2 | issue = | pages =99–118 | year =2001| url =http://irfancolloquia.org/28/momen_byzantines| accessdate = 2013-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís believe a significant purpose of revelation is to guide the spiritual development of the individual and that accepting the prophet of God is important as a significant chance at advancing the conditional achievement of discovering the virtues themselves and expressing them.&lt;ref name="hatcher1" /&gt; If one succeeds in achieving these to a superlative degree then that person will be of benefit to all mankind from the afterlife&lt;ref name="hatcher1" /&gt; while those who are far from God have no power to affect the living any more.&lt;ref name="Abib" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hatcher3"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Hatcher| first =William S. | title =The Concept of Spirituality | journal =Bahá'í Studies | volume =11 | issue = | pages = | publisher =Ottawa: Association for Bahá'í Studies | year = 1982 | url =http://bahai-library.com/hatcher_bw18_spirituality| accessdate = 2013-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= Smith|first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith|title= burial, "death and afterlife", evil, evil spirits, sin |year= 2000|publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1|pages= 96–97, 118–119, 135–136, 322–323 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, evil is not viewed as a power in the next world - people who are evil are described as "atrophied" and "enfeebled"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=`Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink=`Abdu'l-Bahá |origyear=1912 |year=1995 |title=Paris Talks|edition=Hardcover |publisher=Bahá'í Distribution Service |isbn=1-870989-57-0|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PT/pt-31.html.utf8#gr7| pages = 96–99 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that accounts of "possession" are about people who have yielded to their own darker passions and baser nature.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

Even though heaven is a condition more than a place it is still described as a realm where those who are close to God also are close to each other.&lt;ref name="Moshe"&gt;{{cite web| last =Sharon | first = Moshe | authorlink =Moshe Sharon | title =Death and Dying in the Bahá’í Faith| work =Chair in Bahá'í Studies Publications | publisher =The Hebrew University of Jerusalem | date =Jan 13, 2011 | url =https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:pu2yj-NUMtYJ:www.hum.huji.ac.il/upload/_FILE_1294940501.doc+&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESh9IEX1RyP2gRTTKBUs67cOjtFw66_boJIIYFGkqsQqDVmR4Qa9xLFpUyzEGjKZLDktFJXqiruWIVI8VOwbHDUlrWOpdDwUcXUkN9jmVgUpbh7pBaxVvn0fJkR35Jqf6C-_CD1Q&amp;sig=AHIEtbSPu9gw2kkIAZs1216rli6YegzJeg|format = Word doc | accessdate = 2013-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in the afterlife one encounters the prophets of old and other historical people. While the individual experiences dramatic changes from birth and the stages of life in this world then death and life beyond, Bahá'ís hold it is the same soul, the same sense of identity, through the dramatic changes of circumstances. However the worlds of the womb, life in this world and the life beyond are actually interwoven. It's not like moving to a distant place - the afterlife is also "here", unseen by those living on earth. Life in this world affects that one and life in that one affects this. Death is about the letting go of the physical frame and its requirements and has no real identity itself.

[[Judgement Day]] is perceived to be about the time after a new Revelator when the followers of the former dispensation are judged/tested.&lt;ref name="hatcher1" /&gt; If they are affirmed they are "raised" or "return" (not as individuals but as types of people, like John the Baptist was the return of Elijah but not Elijah himself.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Buck | first = Christopher | title =Paradise and paradigm: key symbols in Persian Christianity and the Baha’i Faith | publisher =State University of New York Press, Albany | year =2009 | pages =90–1, 189 | url =http://bahai-library.com/pdf/b/buck_paradise_paradigm.pdf | isbn =0-7914-4061-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circumstances of mass "[[resurrection]]" in the last days refers to when the process will be world embracing rather than in one country or people or another. This is also one of many reasons why Bahá'ís do not believe in the literal return to earth of the same individual soul as is believed by those who hold to reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Bayat | first = Sateh |author2=Vafa Bayat | title =A Bahá'í Understanding of Reincarnation in Relation to the World's Faiths | journal =Lights of Irfan; Papers Presented at the ‘Irfán Colloquia and Seminars | volume =6 | issue = | pages = 21–46 | year =2004 | url =http://irfancolloquia.org/53/bayat_reincarnation | accessdate = 2013-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus this Judgement Day is not the same as the judgement that happens after death but there too there is a judgement and the reality behind the words one lived by are measured. Rewards for correctly applying virtues and punishments for incorrectly doing so are settled but ongoing learning still takes place starting in the last moments of earthly life. Bahá'ís believe we will know and converse with those we have known as well as those who have already died.

Expressing information about the afterlife is inherently limited in this life.&lt;ref name="Musmumian1" /&gt; It is explained that the next life is fundamentally different in many ways from this life. The parallel is made comparing life in the womb with this life and the changes after birth to the changes after death. Realities of the latter are not available even as concepts in the former - they are ineffable. The idea of a body in the next world is still present but it is a heavenly body. There is a realm of lights and reunion with deceased associates. God will be witnessed as if it were a sun in the sky but there is no night. The sanctity of human nature is affirmed when it reflects the light of God and the truths of existence become known and a basic fear of death is overcome and a universal acceptance of the religions as coming from one source.

===Laws and rules===
Among the specific rules Bahá'ís are to try to follow concerning death are, depending on the civil law of their country:&lt;ref name="hatcher1" /&gt;

* No [[cremation]] or [[embalming]]. It is not a harm to the soul itself but the body is to be respected, not destroyed or harmed in general. Donation to science is allowed if the other rules can be followed.
* [[Suicide]] is seen as a rejection of God's plan for humans and is forbidden to followers of the religion. The religion teaches that the souls of adherents can "suffer spiritually" if they commit suicide, but recommends that bereaving families be comforted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* There are no mourning rituals specified but there is a shared prayer for the dead to be read for Bahá'ís.
* There is a ring with an inscription Bahá'ís should wear when buried and the body wrapped in a shroud. The inscription should read (in whatever translation of language) “I came forth from God and return unto Him, detached from all save Him, holding fast to His Name, the Merciful, the Compassionate.”&lt;ref name="Moshe" /&gt;
* Interment of the body should be in a coffin.&lt;ref name="Moshe" /&gt;
* Burial should take place no more than an hour's travel from the place of death.
* The appropriate marker on the gravestone is a nine-pointed star and or the word Bahá'í. Other inscriptions are allowed but not required.
* Bahá'í-run funerals for non-Bahá'ís require none of these requirements.
* Infants who die are under the mercy and bounty of God.

Mourning, the distress and pain of the loss of contact with friends and kin for Bahá'ís is, aside from cultural issues and norms in society, characterized as another stage of life - a temporary condition that will be changed someday just as someday the infant in the womb comes into the material world through birth and into the company of family and friends.&lt;ref name="hatcher1" /&gt; Not avoiding the sense of loss, Baha'u'llah emphasizes the sense of mystery in death, pointing out that though he has shared some aspects of death and afterlife:&lt;blockquote&gt;"“The Mysteries of man’s physical death and of his return have not been divulged, and still remain unread… Were they to be revealed, they would evoke such fear and sorrow that some would perish, while others would be so filled with gladness as to wish for death, and beseech, with unceasing longing, the one true God – exalted be His Glory – to hasten their end.”&lt;ref name="Moshe" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; As this is not apparent to anyone, instead we struggle with the fact of death.&lt;ref name="Moshe" /&gt;

Bahá'ís do allow for cultural norms of societies they live in. For example, among the indigenous of [[Bahá'í Faith in Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]] Christian missionaries had openly opposed traditional funerary art and performances while the Bahá'ís encouraged their production as a form of worship. Thus while [[Nalik culture|Nalik]] Bahá'ís are regarded by other Naliks as arbiters of traditional knowledge and practices, the Christian missions and their followers are seen as antagonistic to [[kastom]].&lt;ref name="were"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Were |first = Graeme | title =Thinking through images:''Katom'' and the coming of the Bahá'ís to Northern New Ireland, Papua New Guinea | journal =Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute |volume =11 | issue = | pages =659–676 |year =2005 | url =http://www.nhbahais.com/BahaiPapers/newguinea.pdf | accessdate = 2013-01-01 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9655.2005.00256.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'ís view prayers in this world as of use to those who have passed on as are indeed their prayers for us still living in this world.&lt;ref name="Moshe" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Esselmont |first =John Ebenezer | authorlink =John Esslemont | editor-last =Right Rev.

=== Impressions of a Bahá'í point of view on death and the afterlife ===
[[A Practical Reference to Religious Diversity for Operational Police and Emergency Services]] is designed to offer guidance to police and emergency services personnel on how religious affiliation can affect their contact with the public. The second edition published in 2002 in Australia mentioned norms that could be expected of Bahá'ís in the case of dying or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Practical Reference to Religious Diversity for Operational Police|publisher=Australasian Police Multicultural Advisory Bureau|edition=2nd|year=2002|pages=|url=http://www.apmab.gov.au/guide/religious2/religious_guide.pdf|isbn=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050619070219/http://www.apmab.gov.au/guide/religious2/religious_guide.pdf|archivedate=19 June 2005|page =18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that Bahá'ís believe in life after death, holding that the [[soul]] is created at the moment of conception and will retain its individuality in an eternal realm. The body, which is compared to the lamp holding the light of the soul during its time in this world, should be treated with dignity. Embalming is not to take place unless required by law. The body should be transported as little as possible after death, and interment must take place within an hour's travel time from the city or town where death occurs. Cremation is forbidden. From its scriptures it is said that "the soul is a sign of God, a heavenly gem whose reality the most learned of men hath failed to grasp, and whose mystery no mind, however acute, can ever hope to unravel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink=Bahá'u'lláh |year=1976 |title=Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-187-6|pages=158–163|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-82.html#gr1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These points are noted in other sources as well.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal| last = Siriwardena | first =A.

Therefore be thou not disconsolate, do not languish, do not sigh, neither wail nor weep; for agitation and mourning deeply affect his soul in the divine realm.

Therefore, lament not, O Mother, and be not grieved; I am not of the lost, nor have I been obliterated and destroyed. I have shaken off the mortal form and have raised my banner in this spiritual world. Following this separation is everlasting companionship.

=== Bahá'í literature ===

== Near-death experiences ==

===Literature===
In addition to outlining scriptural references examining the afterlife some have specifically examined parallels between the statements in the scriptures and scholarly statements about stages of [[Near-death experience]]s, notably:

* ''Light After Death''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Bryson | first = Alan | title =Light After Death | publisher =Sterling Publishers Pvt.

Across 112 pages he outlines chapters on realm of light, being of light, reunion, universal knowledge, ineffability, the soul, immortality, the transformation of values that results and compares these with scriptural references of the religion.
* ''The Purpose of Physical Reality''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hatcher | first =John S. | title =The Purpose of Physical Reality| chapter =The Eternal Consequences of our Physical Performance: Hell, Heaven, or "None of the Above" | chapterurl =https://books.google.com/books?id=vnTPWaMN_RMC&amp;pg=PA187|publisher =Bahá'í Publishing Trust | year = 2005 | origyear =1987 | pages = - 187–218 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=vnTPWaMN_RMC |isbn = 9781931847230}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1987 and revised in 2005 has a chapter to this purpose: "The Eternal Consequences of our Physical Performance: Hell, Heaven or "None of the Above". Across 31 pages in his chapter he outlines sections on fear of death, passage to the next world, the effects of NDE on contemporary attitudes about the afterlife, dissociation of soul and body, awareness of other souls, the ineffable nature of the experience, the purpose of life, negative experiences in the afterlife, accountability, a loving and forgiving God, self-judgment, and bewildered ones again discussing and comparing each subject with Bahá'í scriptural references.
* ''The Handbook of Near-Death Experiences: Thirty Years of Investigation'' has a chapter, "World Religions and Near-Death Experiences" by Farnaz Masumian, which reviews across religions. About 4 and a half pages are spent on the Bahá'í Faith's comparisons.&lt;ref name="Musmumian1" /&gt;

Many qualities reported by NDErs find parallels in Bahá'í writings&lt;ref name="Musmumian1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="musmumian2"&gt;{{cite book| last =Masumian| first = Farnaz | title =Life After Death: A Study of the Afterlife in World Religions | chapter =The Bahá'í Faith | chapterurl =https://books.google.com/books?id=dI1WEwE2W90C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA89#v=onepage | publisher =Kalimat Press | edition = illustrated, reprint | year = 2002 | pages =87–111 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=dI1WEwE2W90C | isbn = 9781890688271 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hatcher2"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hatcher | first =John S. | title =The Purpose of Physical Reality| chapter =The Eternal Consequences of our Physical Performance: Hell, Heaven, or "None of the Above" | chapterurl =https://books.google.com/books?id=vnTPWaMN_RMC&amp;pg=PA187|publisher =Bahá'í Publishing Trust |year = 2005 | origyear =1987 | pages = - 187–218 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=vnTPWaMN_RMC |isbn = 9781931847230}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the quality of the experience being ineffable, having a heavenly body, a realm of light, meeting others, reviewing one's life, and meeting a superlative being of light. Additionally the kinds of positive transformation the NDErs report also find parallels in the values Bahá'ís are encouraged to seek&lt;ref name="Musmumian1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="musmumian2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hatcher2" /&gt; - a new appreciation of knowledge and learning, the importance of love, an absence of fear of death, the importance of physical life on earth, a belief in the sanctity of human nature, and an emphasis on manifesting such positive attributes as love, justice, selfless service, unity, and peace - something viewed by NDErs and Bahá'ís as being important to all religions and rising above specifics of doctrines and sectarianism. Negative experiences of NDErs are also paralleled in Bahá'í writings&lt;ref name="hatcher2" /&gt; - the effect of suicide, the prospect of "limbo" for "breaking the rules", that when taking the chance to learn from mistakes is important and that the life review includes facing the negative deeds done, even of hellish experiences.

In a paper describing patterns of understanding spiritual dreams and visions by Necati Alkan, [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], a key authority in the Bahá'í Faith, sometimes separates dreams and visions into three categories: true, interpretative, and confused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The second can be decoded for the truth, and the third only reflect "the strife and contention" of the experiencer. According to `Abdu'l-Bahá, the work of decoding the second type is like, in Necati Alkan words, "if you add any colour to a white cloth, it will accept it; but if you add blue to a yellow cloth, it will become green and the truth is distorted. In order to have the true colour, one needs to remove the added colour." Indeed, sometimes `Abdu'l-Bahá notes such experiences can mean the opposite of what they seem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Personal presentations ===

In addition to general reviews of the statements of scriptures and comparisons of them with near death experiences in general there are a few individuals who have had their experiences published and shared.

==== Others mentioned in relation to the religion ====

In addition to the above, two others have reported NDEs and have some relationship to the religion. In Atwater's more recent book ''Near-Death Experiences, the Rest of the Story: What They Teach Us about Living and Dying and Our True Purpose''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Atwater | first =P. M. H. | title =Near-Death Experiences, the Rest of the Story: What They Teach Us about Living and Dying and Our True Purpose | publisher =Hampton Roads Publishing| year = 2011 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=zyAttorNyXMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA257 | isbn = 9781571746511}}&lt;/ref&gt; on p.&amp;nbsp;257 Atwater records an anecdote of another reference to the religion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is my opinion," said Teri, "that Michael has been living with the aftereffects since childhood. One afternoon he called me and asked if I wanted to go to church with him. I said no, but I would love to take him to [[Bahá'í House of Worship (Wilmette, Illinois)|
Bahá'í Temple in Wilmette]]. After climbing the stairs to the Temple together we walked in a circle, reading inscriptions over the doors. Over one set of doors, facing East, we paused to read, "Ye are the fruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch.' I looked up at Michael as tears welled in his eyes. I could feel his pain and frustration. It was the kind of frustration that comes with the knowledge of having crossed over, of having been 'there', of having returned from the threshold of death carrying his message for mankind with a remote memory of 'the other side'."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nina Lembcke Holte Harvey has been interviewed by Warren Odess-Gillett on "A Bahá'í Perspective" for [[WXOJ-LP]] about her NDEs in her childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title =Nina Lembcke Holte Harvey| episodelink =| url =http://www.bahaipodcast.com/assets/mp3/abp-246.mp3| series =A Bahá'í Perspective| credits =Warren Odess-Gillett| station =WXOJ-LP|location=Northampton MA| airdate =October 29, 2011| season =7|number =27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief Albert Isaac of [[Aishihik]] is recorded as having identified a near death experience of his in 1957 with the Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Echevarria| first = Lynn | title =A new skin for an old drum: changing contexts of Yukon Aboriginal Bahá'í storytelling| journal =Northern Review| volume =29 | issue =Fall 2008| pages = 39–55 | year =2008 | url =http://bahai-library.com/echevarria_aboriginal_bahai_storytelling |accessdate = 2013-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bedgebury Forest Woman''' refers to an unknown female decedent who was found in [[Bedgebury Forest]], [[Kent]], [[England]] on 23 October 1979. Despite multiple investigations, an arrest and a trial the woman has never been identified.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/7056796.stm|title=New appeal over 1979 forest death|last=|first=|date=2007-10-22|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery of the victim ==
The body was found by a woman riding on horseback through [[Bedgebury Forest]] on Tuesday, 23 October 1979.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite episode|series=[[Crimewatch]]|station=BBC One|date=December 1984|time=23m40s}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forest floor was dry as the weather had been dry and sunny for a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.london-weather.eu/article.118.html|title=London Weather - 1979 Cool.

== Description of the victim ==
The severity of the injuries to the woman’s head and body prevented identification.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/may/06/2|title=Man, 75, in court over 1979 killing|last=Mcleod|first=Maurice|date=2000-05-06|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woman was aged between 30 and 35, she was quite short at 5ft 1in and she had a thin build.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She had brown eyes and straight shoulder-length hair which she had kept in its natural, dark-brown colour&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The victim was wearing black shoes, a distinctive floral dress, a black polo neck jumper&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and a yellow blouse&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;. The police stated that the black and white patterned dress was the clue that was most likely to lead to the discovery of her identity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The dress was found to have been homemade from furniture fabric.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It had been altered on multiple occasions; once to the [[hem]] and another to the chest area.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite episode|series=[[Crimewatch]]|station=BBC One|date=December 1994|time=27m00s}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dress had been purchased at a [[Charity shop|charity]], or [[Second-hand shop|second hand]] shop.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Police believed that the victim was very poor&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and possibly from the [[Northern England|north]] of England.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

The autopsy revealed that the victim had an [[ectopic pregnancy]] which had been present for 4-6 weeks and bleeding for 2-3 weeks.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite episode|series=[[Crimewatch]]|station=BBC One|date=December 1984|time=24m40s}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victim would have been in severe pain and may have visited a doctor suspecting [[appendicitis]] as the pain would have occurred on her right side.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; [[Stretch marks]] on her stomach indicated that she had probably given birth to at least one child.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The victim’s [[molars]] were very worn down and she had [[Wisdom tooth|wisdom teeth]] which indicated that she was at least 30 years old.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; There was no evidence that the victim had ever visited a [[dentist]] in her life.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The victim had prominent, visibly decayed teeth.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite episode|series=[[Crimewatch]]|station=BBC One|date=February 1999|time=22m10s}}&lt;/ref&gt; No [[nicotine]] staining was found on the victim’s hands, teeth or lungs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Additionally, the victim’s lungs did not exhibit the carbon deposits typical of a city-dweller, indicating that she probably lived in the countryside.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Police believe the woman was of no fixed address and was a regular [[hitchhiker]] along the [[M1 motorway|M1]] and [[M6 motorway|M6]] motorways and may have had a connection with the [[Vale of Evesham]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; There was a possibility that she may have been working as a [[prostitute|sex worker]], operating from [[Spitalfields]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases-int/462ufuk.html|title=The Doe Network: 462UFUK|website=www.doenetwork.org|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Initial investigation ==
After the discovery the police searched the missing persons databases at [[New Scotland Yard]] and the UK [[Social services|Social Services]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hospitals and doctors surgeries were also polled for persons who matched the description of the woman.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A large poster campaign was launched throughout the UK and Europe.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; All of these investigative efforts failed to produce a match to the woman's identity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Subsequent events ==

=== Crimewatch 1984 ===
In December 1984 the victim was featured on an episode of the [[BBC]] TV program, [[Crimewatch]]. Police appealed for the persons that made, or altered the black and white dress to come forward.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Reopening of the case ===
In October 1998 the case was reopened after an investigation by [[forensic scientists]] on archived evidence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The victim's case was highlighted in the national media as one of a number of such cases that had been reopened due to a new DNA technique that enabled the generation of DNA profiles from much smaller samples than had been previously possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The size of these samples was described as being as small as a single blood cell, or a flake of skin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Arrest ===
In January 1999 the first arrest in the case was made.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Harry J R Pennells (b. q1 1925)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?r=152477583:3115&amp;d=bmd_1537384567|title=Harry J R Pennells|last=|first=|date=|website=Free BMD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, then 75, of [[Ticehurst]], [[East Sussex]] was charged with the victim’s murder.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pennells, who was 54 at the time of the murder&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; was a retired lorry driver&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and had worked for Henley’s Transport who were based in [[Kent]] at the time of the murder.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Pennells had originally been questioned by police a few days after the discovery of the body.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He had been interviewed three times between 1979 and 1980&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and was one of a number of suspects.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He had not been charged following the initial investigation,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; however, after specks of blood found in his lorry in 1979 were re-examined and linked to the victim police were able to make their arrest.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Pennells was subsequently bailed and a report was sent to the [[Crown Prosecution Service]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Crimewatch 1999 ===
On 22 February 1999 the victim’s case was featured on Crimewatch for a second time.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It was revealed that after the original Crimewatch appeal in 1984 the person who made the black-and-white dress had made contact. The woman, who was from [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] stated that she had given the dress to a charity shop in [[Evesham]], [[Worcestershire]] after which, police could not trace it.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It appeared to have been subsequently altered to shorten the length, remove the zip from the back and add a black lace ruff to the collar. An appeal was made for the person who made these alterations to come forward.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; 

=== Trial ===
The trial started on 4 May 2000 at [[Maidstone]] [[Crown Court]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Pennells was accused of picking up the victim at [[Spitalfields Market Constabulary|Spitalfields Market]] on 19 October 1979,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; taking her in his lorry to a delivery in [[Keighley]], [[West Yorkshire]], then back to drop her off in South London on the morning of the 20th October&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and beating the victim to death with a wooden stake.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Pennells told the court that he had picked up a female hitchhiker.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He admitted that the hitchhiker may have been the victim, but that he had dropped her off alive and was innocent of her murder.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

Witnesses called by the prosecution stated that they had seen a woman matching the victims description in Bedgebury Forest on 21 October 1979 which was the day after the murder was suspected to have happened according to some estimates.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Two witnesses who were at the [[Keighley|Keighley]] lorry depot stated that they saw, and spoke to, a young woman who was with Pennells.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Staff at the Henley Transport's [[Rochdale]] depot also stated that they saw Pennells with a woman who was similar to an artist's impression made of the victim.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Samples of blood and flakes of hair found in a sleeping bag on the passenger seat of the lorry matched the DNA profile of the victim.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, particles of foam from a mattress in the cab of the lorry were found on the victim's dress.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

The trial lasted for four weeks, after which Pennells was found not guilty&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in an unanimous decision made after the jury deliberated for 1 hour and 15 minutes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Subsequent appeals to identify the victim ===
In October 2007 the charity missing persons appealed to the public for someone to come forward and identify the woman.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Béla Ferenc Dezső Blaskó''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈbeːlɒ ˈfɛrɛnt͡s ˈdɛʒøː ˈblɒʃkoː|lang}}; 20 October 1882 – 16 August 1956), better known as '''Bela Lugosi''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|g|oʊ|s|i|}}; {{IPA-hu|ˈluɡoʃi|lang}}), was a [[Hungarian-American]] actor famous for portraying [[Count Dracula]] in the [[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|1931 film]] and for his roles in other [[horror films]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

After playing small parts on the stage in his native Hungary, Lugosi got his first role in a film in 1917. He had to leave the country after [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|the failed Hungarian Communist Revolution of 1919]]. He acted in several films in [[Weimar Germany]] before arriving in the United States as a seaman on a merchant ship.

In 1927, he appeared as Count Dracula in a Broadway adaptation of [[Bram Stoker]]'s [[Dracula|novel]]. He later appeared in the classic 1931 film ''Dracula'' by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]. Through the 1930s, he occupied an important niche in popular horror films, with their East European setting, but his Hungarian accent limited his repertoire, and he tried unsuccessfully to avoid typecasting.

Meanwhile, he was often paired with [[Boris Karloff]], who was able to demand top billing. To his frustration, Lugosi, a charter member of the American [[Screen Actors Guild]], was increasingly restricted to minor parts, kept employed by the studio principally so that they could put his name on the posters. Among his pairings with Karloff, he performed major roles only in ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'' (1934), ''[[The Raven (1935 film)|The Raven]]'' (1935), and ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939); even in ''The Raven'', Karloff received top billing despite Lugosi performing the lead role. By this time, Lugosi had been receiving regular medication for [[sciatica|sciatic neuritis]], and he became addicted to [[morphine]] and [[methadone]]. This drug dependence was noted by producers, and the offers eventually dwindled to a few parts in [[Ed Wood]]'s low-budget films—most notably ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''. Lugosi, who was married five times and had one son, [[Bela G. Lugosi|Bela George]], died of a heart attack on August 16, 1956.

==Early life==
[[File:Bela Lugosi 18.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Lugosi at age 18]]
Lugosi, the youngest of four children,&lt;ref name=monsters-universal-studios&gt;{{cite book|author1=Osborn, Jennifer (editor)|author2=Milano, Roy (photo captions)|year=2006|title=Monsters: A Celebration of the Classics from Universal Studios|publisher=Del Ray Books, imprint of Random House, Inc.|location=New York, NY|page=38|isbn=0-345-48685-4}} Referenced information is from an essay in the book written by his son Bela G. Lugosi.&lt;/ref&gt; was born Béla Ferenc Dezső Blaskó in Lugos, [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (now [[Lugoj]], [[Romania]]) to [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] father István Blaskó, a banker, and [[Serbian people|Serbian]]-born mother Paula de Vojnich.&lt;ref&gt;"United States Census, 1930," database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XCJB-Z61 : accessed 20 May 2018), Bela Lugosi, Los Angeles (Districts 0001-0250), Los Angeles, California, United States; citing enumeration district (ED) ED 47, sheet 9A, line 4, family 193, NARA microfilm publication T626 (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 2002), roll 133; FHL microfilm 2,339,868.&lt;/ref&gt; He later based his last name on his hometown.&lt;ref name=monsters-universal-studios/&gt; He and his sister Vilma were raised in a [[Roman Catholic]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rhodes|first=Gary|title=Lugosi: His Life in Films, on Stage, and in the Hearts of Horror Lovers|year=1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?visbn=0-7864-0257-1&amp;id=Aueo3mOrIKIC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38|isbn=0-7864-0257-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 12, Lugosi dropped out of school.&lt;ref name=monsters-universal-studios/&gt; He began his acting career in 1901 or 1902. His earliest known performances are from provincial theatres in the 1903–04 season, playing small roles in several plays and [[operetta]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Lennig, ''The Immortal Count'', University Press of Kentucky, 2003, p. 21; {{ISBN|978-0-8131-2273-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] plays and other major roles. After moving to [[Budapest]] in 1911, he played dozens of roles with the National Theatre of Hungary between 1913–19. Although Lugosi would later claim that he "became the leading actor of Hungary's Royal National Theatre", almost all his roles there were small or supporting parts.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Lennig, ''The Immortal Count'', University Press of Kentucky, 2003, pp. 25–26, 28–29; {{ISBN|978-0-8131-2273-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], he served as an infantryman in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] from 1914–16, rising to the rank of [[Rank_insignia_of_the_Austro-Hungarian_armed_forces#Officers_and_officials|Lieutenant]]. He was awarded the [[Wound Medal (Austria-Hungary)|Wound Medal]] for wounds he suffered while serving on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Russian front]].&lt;ref name=monsters-universal-studios/&gt;

Due to his activism in the actors' union in Hungary during the [[Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918–1920)|revolution of 1919]], he was forced to flee his homeland.&lt;ref name=monsters-universal-studios/&gt; He went first to [[Vienna]] before settling in [[Berlin]] (in the Langestrasse), where he continued acting.&lt;ref name=monsters-universal-studios/&gt; He took the name "Lugosi" in 1903 to honor his birthplace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-franklin-ruehl-phd/halloween-facts-history-_b_1074357.html|title=15 Intriguing Halloween-Related Factoids!|date=3 November 2011|work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually travelled to [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] as a crewman aboard a [[Merchant vessel|merchant ship]].&lt;ref name=monsters-universal-studios/&gt;

==Career==

===Early films===
Lugosi's first film appearance was in the movie ''[[The Colonel (1917 film)|Az ezredes]]'' (''The Colonel'', 1917). When appearing in [[Cinema of Hungary|Hungarian]] [[silent film]]s, he used the stage name '''Arisztid Olt'''.&lt;ref name="mank"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/607553826 |title=Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff : the expanded story of a haunting collaboration, with a complete filmography of their films together |last=Mank |first=Gregory W. |publisher=McFarland &amp; Co., Publishers |year=2009 |isbn=9780786434800 |location=Jefferson, N.C. |pages=22–23 |oclc=607553826}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lugosi made 12 films in Hungary between 1917 and 1918 before leaving for Germany. Following the collapse of [[Béla Kun]]'s [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] in 1919, [[political left|leftists]] and [[trade union]]ists became vulnerable. Lugosi was proscribed from acting due to his participation in the formation of an actors' [[labor union|union]]. In exile in [[Weimar Republic]] Germany, he began appearing in a small number of well-received films, among them adaptations of the [[Karl May]] novels ''[[On the Brink of Paradise|Auf den Trümmern des Paradieses]]'' (''On the Brink of Paradise'') and ''[[Caravan of Death (film)|Die Todeskarawane]]'' (''The Caravan of Death''), opposite the [[Jewish]] actress [[Dora Gerson]] (who died in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]).

Lugosi left Germany in October 1920, intending to emigrate to the United States, and entered the country at [[New Orleans]] in December 1920. He made his way to [[New York City|New York]] and was inspected by immigration officers at [[Ellis Island]] in March 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Passenger list of the S.S.

On his arrival in America, the {{convert|6|ft|1|in|m|adj=on}},&lt;ref name="mank"/&gt; {{convert|180|lb|kg|adj=on}} Lugosi worked for some time as a laborer, and then entered the theater in New York City's Hungarian immigrant colony. With fellow Hungarian actors he formed a small [[repertory|stock company]] that toured Eastern cities, playing for immigrant audiences. Lugosi acted in several Hungarian plays before breaking out into his first English [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play, ''The Red Poppy'', in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hollywood Gothic|last = Skal|first = David|publisher = Faber and Faber Inc|year = 2004|isbn = 9780571211586|location = New York City|pages = 124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three more parts came in 1925–26, including a five-month run in the comedy-fantasy ''The Devil in the Cheese''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=50322 Bela Lugosi profile], ibdb.com; accessed 1 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, he appeared as an Arab Sheik in ''Arabesque'' which premiered in [[Buffalo, New York]] at the Teck Theatre before moving to Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beladraculalugosi.wordpress.com/bela-lugosi-on-the-on-stage/ Bela Lugosi premieres in Buffalo, New York]&lt;/ref&gt; His first American film role came in the 1923 melodrama ''[[The Silent Command]]''.

&lt;!--[[File:Bela Lugosi as Dracula, anonymous photograph from 1931, Universal Studios.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Lugosi as [[Dracula]]]]--&gt;
Lugosi was approached in the summer of 1927 to star in a [[Broadway theatre]] production of ''[[Dracula (1924 play)|Dracula]]'', which had been adapted by [[Hamilton Deane]] and [[John L. Balderston]] from [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1897 [[Dracula (novel)|novel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Rhodes|first1=Gary Don|title=Lugosi: his life in films, on stage, and in the hearts of horror lovers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aueo3mOrIKIC&amp;pg=PA169|format=[[Google Books]]|accessdate=18 February 2009|year=1997|page=169|chapter=Stage Appearances}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Horace Liveright]] production was successful, running for 261 performances before touring the United States to much fanfare and critical acclaim throughout 1928 and 1929. In 1928, Lugosi decided to stay in California when the play ended its West Coast run. His performance had piqued the interest of [[Fox Film]], and in 1929 he appeared in the studio's silent film ''[[The Veiled Woman]]''. He also appeared in the film ''[[Prisoners (1929) film|Prisoners]]'' (considered [[Lost film|lost]]), which was released in both silent and [[Sound film|talkie]] versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lennig|first1=Arthur|title=Immortal count : the life and films of bela lugosi.|date=2010|publisher=Univ Pr Of Kentucky|location=Lexington|isbn=0813126614}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prisoners (1929)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020291/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_75|website=IMDb|publisher=IMDb.com, Inc.|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, with no other film roles in sight, he returned to the stage as Dracula for a short West Coast tour of the play. Lugosi remained in California where he resumed his film work under contract with Fox, appearing in early talkies often as a [[Villain|heavy]] or an "exotic [[Sheikh|sheik]]". He also continued to lobby for his prized role in the film version of ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0402729/?ref_=nm_flmg_slf_24|title=Biography (TV Series):  Bela Lugosi: Hollywood's Dark Prince|website=IMDb|publisher=IMDb.com, Inc.|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his critically acclaimed performance on stage, Lugosi was not [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]' first choice for the role of Dracula when the company optioned the rights to the Deane play and began production in 1930.{{Efn|group=notes|name=rumour|A persistent rumor asserts that director [[Tod Browning]]'s long-time collaborator [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] was Universal's first choice for the role, and that Lugosi was chosen only due to Chaney's death shortly before production. This is questionable because Chaney had been under long-term contract to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] since 1925, and had negotiated a lucrative new contract just before his death.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Chaney and Browning had worked together on several projects (including four of Chaney's final five releases), but Browning was only a last-minute choice to direct the movie version of ''Dracula'' after the death of director [[Paul Leni]], who had originally been slated to direct.}} Different prominent actors were considered before Browning cast Lugosi for the role, but the film was a hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/84310/12-surprising-facts-about-bela-lugosi|title=12 Surprising Facts About Bela Lugosi|date=2016-08-16|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typecasting===
[[File:Irene Ware and Bela Lugosi in The Raven.jpg|thumb|left|[[Irene Ware]] and Lugosi in ''[[The Raven (1935 film)|The Raven]]'' (1935)]]

Through his association with ''Dracula'' (in which he appeared with minimal makeup, using his natural, heavily accented voice), Lugosi found himself [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as a [[horror film|horror]] villain in films such as ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'', ''[[The Raven (1935 film)|The Raven]]'', and ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' for Universal, and the independent ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]''. His accent, while a part of his image, limited the roles he could play.

Lugosi did attempt to break type by auditioning for other roles. He lost out to [[Lionel Barrymore]] for the role of [[Grigori Rasputin]] in ''[[Rasputin and the Empress]]''; [[C. Henry Gordon]] for the role of Surat Khan in ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936 film)|Charge of the Light Brigade]]'', and [[Basil Rathbone]] for the role of Commissar Dimitri Gorotchenko in ''[[Tovarich (film)|Tovarich]]'' (a role Lugosi had played on stage).&lt;ref name="Bela Lugosi In Person"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaffenberger|first1=Bill|last2=Rhodes|first2=Gary|title=Bela Lugosi In Person|date=2015|publisher=BearManor Media|isbn=1593938055|url=https://www.amazon.com/Bela-Lugosi-Person-William-Kaffenberger/dp/1593938055/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played the elegant, somewhat hot-tempered General Nicholas Strenovsky-Petronovich in ''[[International House (1933 film)|International House]]''.

Regardless of controversy, five films at Universal — ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'', ''[[The Raven (1935 film)|The Raven]]'', ''[[The Invisible Ray (1936 film)|The Invisible Ray]]'', ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'', ''[[Black Friday (1940 film)|Black Friday]]'' (plus minor cameo performances in 1934's ''[[Gift of Gab (1934 film)|Gift of Gab]]'') and two at [[RKO Pictures]], ''[[You'll Find Out]]'' and ''[[The Body Snatcher (film)|The Body Snatcher]]'' — paired Lugosi with [[Boris Karloff]]. Despite the relative size of their roles, Lugosi inevitably got second billing, below Karloff. There are contradictory reports of Lugosi's attitude toward Karloff, some claiming that he was openly resentful of Karloff's long-term success and ability to get good roles beyond the horror arena, while others suggested the two actors were — for a time, at least — good friends. Karloff himself in interviews suggested that Lugosi was initially mistrustful of him when they acted together, believing that the Englishman would attempt to upstage him. When this proved not to be the case, according to Karloff, Lugosi settled down and they worked together amicably (though some have further commented that Karloff's on-set demand to break from filming for mid-afternoon tea annoyed Lugosi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mank|first1=Gregory William|title=Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff : the expanded story of a haunting collaboration, with a complete filmography of their films together|date=2009|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co., Publishers|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=0786434805|pages=237–238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karloff also insinuated that his iconic rival could not act, claiming Lugosi had "never learned his trade". Universal did cast Lugosi in a couple of heroic parts, as in ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'' after Karloff had been accorded the more colorful role of the villain, ''[[The Invisible Ray (1936 film)|The Invisible Ray]]'', and a romantic role in the adventure serial ''[[The Return of Chandu]]'', but his typecasting problem appears to have been too entrenched to be alleviated by those films.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Of course, Karloff had a leg up on Lugosi simply by being a native English speaker; Lugosi had to learn English as a second language, and was never able to shed his heavy accent.
[[File:Béla Lugosi-Angelo Rossitto in Scared to Death.jpg|thumb|With [[Angelo Rossitto]] in ''[[Scared to Death]]'' (1947)]]
Lugosi addressed his plea to be cast in non-horror roles directly to casting directors through his listing in the 1937 ''Players Directory'', published by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], in which he (or his agent) calls the idea that he is only fit for horror films "an error."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mallory. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Universal_Studios_Monsters.html?id=ZHhOPgAACAAJ ''Universal Studios Monsters: A Legacy of Horror''], 2009, Universe, p. 63. {{ISBN|978-0-7893-1896-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career decline===
[[File:LugosiDevilBat1.jpg|thumb|right|Lugosi in ''[[The Devil Bat]]'' (1940)]]
A number of factors began to work against Lugosi's career in the mid-1930s. Universal changed management in 1936, and because of a British ban on horror films, dropped them from their production schedule; Lugosi found himself consigned to Universal's non-horror [[B-movie|B-film]] unit, at times in small roles where he was obviously used for "name value" only. Throughout the 1930s, Lugosi, experiencing a severe career decline despite popularity with audiences (Universal executives always preferred his rival Karloff), accepted many leading roles from independent producers like [[Nat Levine]], [[Sol Lesser]], and [[Sam Katzman]]. These low-budget thrillers indicate that Lugosi was less discriminating than Karloff in selecting screen vehicles, but the exposure helped Lugosi financially if not artistically. Lugosi tried to keep busy with stage work, but had to borrow money from the [[Actors Fund of America]] to pay hospital bills when his only child, Bela George Lugosi, was born in 1938.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Historian John McElwee reports, in his 2013 book ''Showmen, Sell It Hot!'', that Bela Lugosi's popularity received a much-needed boost in August 1938, when California theater owner Emil Umann revived ''Dracula'' and ''Frankenstein'' as a special double feature. The combination was so successful that Umann scheduled extra shows to accommodate the capacity crowds, and invited Lugosi to appear in person, which thrilled new audiences that had never seen Lugosi's classic performance. "I owe it all to that little man at the Regina Theatre," said Lugosi of exhibitor Umann. "I was dead, and he brought me back to life." Universal took notice of the tremendous business and launched its own national re-release of the same two horror favorites. The studio then rehired Lugosi to star in new films.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The first was Universal's ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939), when he played the character role of [[Igor (fictional character)|Ygor]], a mad blacksmith with a broken neck, in heavy makeup and beard. The same year saw Lugosi making a rare appearance in an A-list motion picture: he was a stern commissar in [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s comedy ''[[Ninotchka]]'', starring [[Greta Garbo]] and directed by [[Ernst Lubitsch]]. He was effective in this small but prestigious character role, and it could have been a turning point for the actor, but within the year, he was back on Hollywood's [[Poverty Row]], playing leads for Sam Katzman. These horror, comedy and [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] B-films were released by [[Monogram Pictures]]. At Universal, he often received star billing for what amounted to a supporting part. ''[[The Gorilla (1939 film)|The Gorilla]]'' (1939) had him playing [[double act|straight man]] to [[Patsy Kelly]].
[[File:Invisible Ghost (1941) 1.jpg|thumb||left|Lugosi (center) with [[Polly Ann Young]] and [[Clarence Muse]] in ''[[The Invisible Ghost]]'' (1941)]]

Ostensibly due to injuries received during military service, Lugosi developed severe, chronic [[sciatica]]. Though at first he was treated with pain remedies such as [[asparagus]] juice, doctors increased the medication to [[opiate]]s. The growth of his dependence on [[analgesic]] drugs, particularly [[morphine]] and, after 1947 when it became available in America, [[methadone]], was directly proportional to the dwindling of screen offers. He was finally cast in the role of [[Frankenstein's monster]] for Universal's ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'' (1943), but Lugosi had no dialogue. Lugosi's voice had been dubbed over that of [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]], from line readings at the end of ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' (1942).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bela-Lugosi|title=Bela Lugosi {{!}} Hungarian-American actor|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lugosi played Dracula for a second and last time on film in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

''Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein'' was Bela Lugosi's last "A" movie. For the remainder of his life he appeared — less and less frequently — in obscure, low-budget features. From 1947-50, he performed in [[summer stock]], often in productions of ''Dracula'' or ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (play)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'', and during the other parts of the year made personal appearances in a touring "spook show", and on early commercial television.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In September 1949 [[Milton Berle]] invited Lugosi to appear in a sketch on ''[[Texaco Star Theatre]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/9-27-1949/episode/670241/summary.htmlTexaco Star Theater Episode Guide], tv.com; accessed 1 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Lugosi memorized the script for the skit, but became confused on the air when Berle began to ad lib.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weaver|first=Tom|title=Science Fiction and Fantasy Film Flashbacks: Conversations with 24 Actors, Writers, Producers and Directors from the Golden Age|publisher=McFarland|year=2004|page=160|isbn=0-7864-2070-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His only television dramatic role was on the anthology series ''[[Suspense (U.S. TV series)|Suspense]]'' on October 11, 1949, in an adaptation of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s ''[[The Cask of Amontillado]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Actors' Television Credits, 1948–1988, James Robert Parrish and Vincent Terrace''&lt;!--publishing info, ISSN/ISBN, year needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, while in [[England]] to play a six-month tour of ''Dracula'', Lugosi co-starred in a [[Low culture|lowbrow]] film comedy, ''[[Mother Riley Meets the Vampire]]'' (also known as ''Vampire over London'' and ''My Son, the Vampire''). Following his return to the United States, he was interviewed for television, and reflected wistfully on his typecasting in horror parts: "Now I am the [[Bogeyman|boogie man]]." In the same interview he expressed a desire to play more comedy, as he had in the Mother Riley [[farce]]. Independent producer Jack Broder took Lugosi at his word, casting him in a jungle-themed comedy, ''[[Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla]]'' co-starring nightclub comedians [[Duke Mitchell]] and [[Sammy Petrillo]], whose act closely resembled that of [[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Stage and personal appearances===
While Lugosi enjoyed a lively career on stage with plenty of personal appearances, as film offers declined, he became more and more dependent on live venues to support his family. Bela took over the role of Jonathan Brewster from Boris Karloff for ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (play)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]''. Bela had also expressed interest in playing Elwood P. Dowd in ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'' to help himself professionally. He also made plenty of personal appearances to promote his horror image and/or an accompanying film.&lt;ref name="Bela Lugosi In Person"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaffenberger|first1=Bill|last2=Rhodes|first2=Gary|title=No Traveler Returns: The Lost Years of Bela Lugosi|date=2012|publisher=BearManor Media|isbn=1593932855|url=https://www.amazon.com/No-Traveler-Returns-Years-Lugosi/dp/1593932855/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ed Wood and final projects===
[[File:PlanNine 08.jpg|thumb|Lugosi in Ed Wood's ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1959)]]
Late in his life, Bela Lugosi again received star billing in films when ambitious filmmaker [[Ed Wood]], a fan of Lugosi, found him living in obscurity and near-poverty and offered him roles in his films, such as an anonymous narrator in ''[[Glen or Glenda]]'' and a [[Victor Frankenstein|Dr. Frankenstein]]-like [[mad scientist]] in ''[[Bride of the Monster]]''. During [[post-production]] of the latter, Lugosi decided to seek treatment for his [[drug addiction]], and the premiere of the film was said to be intended to help pay for his hospital expenses. According to [[Kitty Kelley]]'s biography of [[Frank Sinatra]], when the entertainer heard of Lugosi's problems, he helped with expenses and visited Lugosi at the hospital. Sinatra would recall Lugosi's amazement at his visit, since the two men had never met before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelley|first=Kitty|title=His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1987|page=248|isbn=0-553-26515-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an impromptu interview upon his exit from the treatment center in 1955, Lugosi stated that he was about to go to work on a new Ed Wood film, ''The Ghoul Goes West''. This was one of several projects proposed by Wood, including ''The Phantom Ghoul'' and ''Dr. Acula''. With Lugosi in his famed Dracula cape, Wood shot impromptu test footage, with no storyline in mind, in front of [[Tor Johnson]]'s home, a suburban graveyard, and in front of Lugosi's apartment building on Carlton Way. This footage ended up in ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'', which was mostly filmed after Lugosi's death. Wood hired [[Tom Mason]], his wife's [[chiropractor]], to double for Lugosi in additional shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lostmag.com/issue18/lugosi.php|title=Bela Lugosi's Legacy|last=Nuzum|first=Eric|work=Lost|accessdate=2008-10-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917071843/http://www.lostmag.com/issue18/lugosi.php|archivedate=17 September 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mason was noticeably taller and thinner than Lugosi, and had the lower half of his face covered with his cape in every shot, as Lugosi sometimes did in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]''.

Following his treatment, Lugosi made one final film, in late 1955, ''[[The Black Sleep]]'', for Bel-Air Pictures, which was released in the summer of 1956 through [[United Artists]] with a promotional campaign that included several personal appearances. To Lugosi's disappointment, however, his role in this film was that of a [[Muteness|mute]], with no dialogue.&lt;ref name="Bela Lugosi: Dreams and Nightmares"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rhodes|first1=Gary|last2=Sheffield|first2=Richard|title=Bela Lugosi: Dreams and Nightmares|date=2007|publisher=Collectables Press|isbn=0977379817|url=https://www.amazon.com/Bela-Lugosi-Rhodes-Richard-Sheffield/dp/0977379817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Lugosi Béla színművész és első felesége, Szmik Ilona. Fortepan 8777.jpg|thumb|With his first wife, Ilona Szmik, in 1917]]
In 1917, Lugosi married Ilona Szmik. The couple divorced in 1920, reputedly over political differences with her parents. In 1921, he married Ilona von Montagh, and divorced in 1924. In 1929, Lugosi took his place in Hollywood society and scandal when he married wealthy [[San Francisco]] resident Beatrice Weeks, widow of [[Weeks and Day|architect Charles Peter Weeks]]. She filed for divorce four months later, citing actress [[Clara Bow]] as the "other woman".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Lennig, ''The Immortal Count'', University Press of Kentucky, 2003, p. 68; {{ISBN|978-0-8131-2273-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 1931, Lugosi became a naturalized United States citizen. In 1933, he married 19-year-old Lillian Arch, the daughter of Hungarian immigrants. They had a child, [[Bela G.

Lugosi married Hope Lininger, his fifth wife, in 1955; they remained married until his death. She had been a fan, writing letters to him when he was in the hospital, recovering from addiction to [[Demerol]]. She would sign her letters "A dash of Hope". She died in 1997 at age 77.

==Death==

Lugosi was buried wearing one of the "Dracula" cape costumes in the [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California]].

==California Supreme Court decision on personality rights==
{{Main|Lugosi v. Universal Pictures}}

In 1979, the ''[[Lugosi v. Universal Pictures]]'' decision by the [[California Supreme Court]] held that Lugosi's [[personality rights]] could not pass to his heirs, as a [[copyright]] would have. The court ruled that under California law any rights of publicity, including the right to his image, terminated with Lugosi's death.{{Efn|group=notes|name=ruling|California's descendibility statute for rights of publicity, Civil Code Section 990, was enacted in 1988, and Lugosi's estate now licenses the commercial use of his name and image.

==Legacy==
In [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', Lugosi is portrayed by [[Martin Landau]], who received the 1994 [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for the performance. According to [[Bela G. Lugosi]] (his son), [[Forrest Ackerman]], [[Dolores Fuller]] and Richard Sheffield, the film's portrayal of Lugosi is inaccurate: In real life, he never used profanity, owned small dogs, or slept in coffins. And contrary to this film, Bela did not struggle performing on ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]''.&lt;ref name="Bela Lugosi: Dreams and Nightmares"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rhodes|first1=Gary|last2=Weaver|first2=Tom|title=Ed Wood's Bride of the Monster|date=2015|publisher=BearManor Media|isbn=1593938578|url=https://www.amazon.com/Woods-Bride-Monster-Gary-Rhodes/dp/1593938578/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Lugosi projects were featured on the television show ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. The 1942 film ''[[The Corpse Vanishes]]'' appeared in episode 105; the serial ''[[The Phantom Creeps]]'' appeared throughout season two, and the Ed Wood production ''[[Bride of the Monster]]'' in episode 423.
An episode of ''[[Sledge Hammer!]]'' titled "Last of the Red Hot Vampires" was an homage to Bela Lugosi; at the end of the episode, it was dedicated to "Mr. Blasko".

In 2001, [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast ''There Are Such Things'' by [[Steven McNicoll]] and Mark McDonnell. Focusing on Lugosi and his well-documented struggle to escape from the role that had typecast him, the play went on to receive the Hamilton Dean Award for best dramatic presentation from the Dracula Society in 2002.

A statue of Lugosi was erected on one of the corners of the [[Vajdahunyad Castle]] in [[Budapest]].

The Ellis Island Immigration Museum in [[New York City]] features a live 30-minute play that focuses on Lugosi's illegal entry into the country and then his arrival at Ellis Island to enter the country legally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ellisisland.org/genealogy/ellis_island_visiting.asp|title=Visiting the Ellis Island Immigration Museum|publisher=ellisisland.org|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bela Lugosi star on HWF.JPG|thumb|left|Lugosi's star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]]
The cape Lugosi wore in ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' (1931) survives today in the ownership of Universal Studios.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The theatrical play ''Lugosi - the Shadow of the Vampire'' ({{Lang-hu|Lugosi - a vámpír árnyéka}}) is based on Lugosi's life, telling the story of his life as he became typecast as Dracula and as his drug addiction worsened. He was played by one of Hungary's most renowned actors, [[Ivan Darvas]].

[[Andy Warhol]]'s 1963 silkscreen ''The Kiss'' depicts Lugosi from ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' about to bite into the neck of co-star [[Helen Chandler]], who played [[Mina Harker]]. A copy sold for $798,000 at [[Christie's]] in May 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=1787949 Andy Warhol (1928–1987): The Kiss (Bela Lugosi)], christies.com; accessed 1 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lugosi was also the subject of "[[Bela Lugosi's Dead]]", the first single by the English band [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]]. Released in August 1979, it is often considered to be the first [[gothic rock]] record.

Lugosi's star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] is mentioned in "[[Celluloid Heroes]]", a song performed by [[The Kinks]] and written by their lead vocalist and principal songwriter, [[Ray Davies]]. It appeared on their 1972 album ''[[Everybody's in Show-Biz]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

A fan of the occult, Lugosi's haunted mirror is on display at [[Zak Bagans]]' haunted museum in Las Vegas, Nevada.

The '''Bion''' satellites ({{lang-ru|Бион}}), also named '''Biocosmos''',{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} were a series of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] (later [[Russia]]n) [[biosatellite]]s. They were part of the [[Kosmos (satellite)|Kosmos satellites]].

== Bion space program ==
=== Bion precursor flights and Bion flights ===
The Soviet biosatellite program began in 1966 with [[Kosmos 110]], and resumed in 1973 with [[Kosmos 605]]. Cooperation in space ventures between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] was initiated in 1971, with the signing of the [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]] in Science and Applications Agreement (which included an agreement on space research cooperation). The Soviet Union first offered to fly US experiments on a Kosmos biosatellite in 1974, only a few years after the termination (in 1969) of the [[Biosatellite program|U.S. biosatellite program]]. The offer was realized in 1975 when the first joint U.S./Soviet research were carried out on the [[Kosmos 782]] mission.

The Bion spacecraft were based on the [[Zenit (satellite)]] and launches began in 1973 with primary emphasis on the problems of radiation effects on human beings. Launches in the program included [[Kosmos 110]], [[Kosmos 605|605]], [[Kosmos 690|690]], [[Kosmos 782|782]], plus [[Nauka module]]s flown on [[Zenit-2M#Zenit 2M|Zenit-2M]] reconnaissance satellites. 90&amp;nbsp;kg of equipment could be contained in the external Nauka module.

The Soviet/Russian Bion program provided U.S. investigators a platform for launching Fundamental Space Biology and biomedical experiments into space. The Bion program, which began in 1966, included a series of missions that flew biological experiments using primates, rodents, insects, cells, and plants on a biosatellite in near-earth orbit. [[NASA]] became involved in the program in 1975 and participated in 9 of the 11 Bion missions.&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundamentalbiology.arc.nasa.gov/science/SC_SFpast.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070802081905/http://www.fundamentalbiology.arc.nasa.gov/science/SC_SFpast.html|archivedate=2007-08-02|title=Past Programs: Bion Biosatellite Program|publisher=NASA|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA ended its participation in the program with the Bion 11 mission launched in December 1996. The collaboration resulted in the flight of more than 100 U.S. experiments, one-half of all U.S. Life Sciences flight experiments accomplished with non-human subjects.&lt;ref name=NASA/&gt;

The missions ranged from five days (Bion 6) to around 22 days (Bion 1 and Kosmos 110).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~cliched/space/spacecraft/bion/bion.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227114941/http://home.earthlink.net/~cliched/space/spacecraft/bion/bion.html|archivedate=2007-02-27|title=Bion|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bion-M ===
In 2005 the Bion program was resumed with three new satellites of the modified Bion-M type – the first flight was launched April 19, 2013 from [[Baikonur]] cosmodrome, [[Kazakhstan]].
The first satellite of the new series [[Bion-M1]] featured an aquarium  by the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Проведение исследований в области космической биологии в условиях микрогравитации на космическом аппарате "Бион-М" №1|url=http://www.roscosmos.ru/main.php?id=400|publisher=Roscosmos.ru|accessdate=2 September 2012|quote=[http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;u=http://www.roscosmos.ru/main.php%3Fid%3D400 Research in the field of space biology in microgravity on the spacecraft "Bion-M" № 1 (Google translation)]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920044804/http://roscosmos.ru/main.php?id=400|archivedate=September 20, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and carried 45 [[mice]], 18 [[Mongolian gerbil]]s, 15 [[gecko]]s, [[snail]]s, [[fish]] and [[micro-organism]]s into orbit for 30 days before re-entry and recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalspace.ru/main.php?id=2&amp;nid=19971|title=Государственная корпорация по космической деятельности РОСКОСМОС -|website=Federalspace.ru|accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://at.theaustralian.com.au/link/3255005a02d230e2013ba7bd68a7bcea?domain=theaustralian.com.au|title=Russia retrieves mice, newts from space|date=May 19, 2013|website=At.theaustralian.com.au|accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the gerbils died due to a hardware failure, but condition of the rest of the experiments, including all geckos, was satisfactory.

'''''Blenheim''''' was built in 1834 at [[Jarrow]], England. She made three voyages [[transportation (punishment)|transporting]] [[convicts]] to Australia. She also carried emigrants to New Zealand. 

==Convict ship==

'''Breastfeeding difficulties''' refers to problems that arise from [[breastfeeding]], the feeding of an [[infant]] or young [[child]] with [[milk]] from a woman's [[mammary gland|breasts]].  Although babies have a [[sucking reflex]] that enables them to suck and swallow milk, and although human [[breast milk]] is usually the best source of [[nutrition|nourishment]] for human infants,&lt;ref name="Picciano_2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Picciano M |title=Nutrient composition of human milk |journal=Pediatr Clin North Am |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=53–67 |year=2001 |pmid=11236733 |doi=10.1016/S0031-3955(05)70285-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are circumstances under which breastfeeding can be problematic, or even, in rare instances, [[contraindicated]].

Difficulties can arise both in connection with the act of breastfeeding and with the health of the nursing infant.

== Breastfeeding problems==
While breastfeeding difficulties are not uncommon, putting the baby to the breast as soon as possible after birth helps to avoid many problems. The policy of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] on breastfeeding says, "delay weighing, measuring, bathing, needle-sticks, and eye prophylaxis until after the first feeding is completed."&lt;ref name="Gartner_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Gartner LM | title=Breastfeeding and the use of human milk | journal=Pediatrics | year=2005 | pages=496–506 | volume=115 | issue=2 | url=http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;115/2/496 | doi=10.1542/peds.2004-2491 | pmid=15687461 | display-authors=etal | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826121341/http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics%3B115/2/496 | archivedate=2007-08-26 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many breastfeeding difficulties can be resolved with proper hospital procedures, properly trained nurses and hospital staff, speech pathologists and lactation consultants.&lt;ref name="Newman_2000"&gt;{{cite book | author = Newman J | authorlink = Jack Newman (doctor) |author2= Pitman T | title = Dr. Jack Newman's guide to breastfeeding | publisher = HarperCollins Publishers | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-00-638568-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source of information is the volunteer-based breastfeeding promotion organization, [[La Leche League]].

A variety of factors and conditions can interfere with successful breastfeeding:

*[[Premature birth|Premature babies]] can have difficulties coordinating their sucking reflex with breathing. They may need to be fed more frequently because their stomachs tend to be smaller, and they may get sleepier during feedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-challenges/breastfeeding-baby-health-problem/#3|title=Breastfeeding a baby with a health problem {{!}} womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Premature infants unable to take enough calories by mouth may need [[Enteral feeding|enteral or gavage feeding]] - inserting a feeding tube into the stomach to provide enough breast milk or a substitute. This is often done together with [[Kangaroo care]] (prolonged skin-to-skin contact with the mother) which makes later breastfeeding easier. For some suckling difficulties, such as may happen with cleft lip/palate, the baby can be fed with a [[Haberman Feeder]].
*[[Dysphoric milk ejection reflex]] (D-MER) is a newly recognized condition affecting lactating women that is characterized by an abrupt dysphoria, or negative emotions that occur just before milk release and continuing not more than a few minutes. Preliminary testing tells us that D-MER is treatable and preliminary research tells us that inappropriate dopamine activity at the time of the milk ejection reflex is the cause of D-MER.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d-mer.org|accessdate=2010-09-10|publisher=d-mer.org|title=d-mer.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low milk supply===
{{main|Low milk supply}}
*Primary lactation failure: occurs when the mother has a condition incompatible with full milk production, for example breast hypoplasia, breast reduction surgery, or bilateral mastectomy.
*Secondary lactation failure: milk production that is low due to preventable factors, such as formula supplementation, poor milk transfer by the baby, or unrelieved breast engorgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jmwh.2007.05.005 | volume=52 | issue=6 | title=Recognizing and Treating Delayed or Failed Lactogenesis II | year=2007 | journal=Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health | pages=588–594 | author=Hurst N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breast pain ===
Pain often interferes with successful breastfeeding. It is cited as the second most common cause for the abandonment of exclusive breastfeeding after perceived low milk supply.&lt;ref name=Woolridge_1986&gt;{{cite journal |author=Woolridge M |title=Aetiology of sore nipples |journal=Midwifery |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=172–76 |year=1986 |pmid=3643398 |doi=10.1016/S0266-6138(86)80042-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inverted nipples===
[[Inverted nipples|Inverted or retracted nipples]] sometimes make attachment to the breast difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Challenge: Inverted, flat, or very large nipples |url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-challenges/common-breastfeeding-challenges |website=Common breastfeeding challenges |publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services. Office on Women's Health |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mothers need additional support to feed their babies. Treatment is started after the birth of the baby. The nipple is manually stretched out several times a day. A pump or a plastic syringe is used to draw out the nipple and the baby is then put to the breast.

=== Engorgement ===
''[[Breast engorgement]]'' is the sense of breast fullness experienced by most women within 36 hours of delivery. Normally, this is a painless sensation of "heaviness". Breastfeeding on demand is the primary way of preventing painful engorgement.

When the breast overfills with milk it becomes painful. Engorgement comes from not getting enough milk from the breast. It happens about 3 to 7 days after delivery and occurs more often in first time mothers. The increased blood supply, the accumulated milk and the swelling all contribute to the painful engorgement.&lt;ref name=Hill_1994&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hill P, Humenick S |title=The occurrence of breast engorgement |journal=J Hum Lact |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=79–86 |year=1994 |pmid=7619260 |doi=10.1177/089033449401000212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engorgement may affect the areola, the periphery of the breast or the entire breast, and may interfere with breastfeeding both from the pain and also from the distortion of the normal shape of the areola/nipple. This makes it harder for the baby to latch on properly for feeding. Latching may occur over only part of the areola. This can irritate the nipple more, and may lead to ineffective drainage of breast milk and more pain. Engorgement may begin as a result of several factors such as nipple pain, improper feeding technique, infrequent feeding or infant-mother separation.

To prevent  or treat engorgement, remove the milk from the breast, by breastfeeding, expressing or [[Breast pump|pumping]]. Gentle massage can help start the milk flow and so reduce the pressure. The reduced pressure softens the areola, perhaps even allowing the infant to feed. Warm water or warm compresses and expressing some milk before feeding can also help make breastfeeding more effective. Some researchers have suggested that after breastfeeding, mothers should pump and/or apply cold compresses to reduce swelling pain and vascularity even more. One published study suggested the use of "chilled cabbage leaves" applied to the breasts. Attempts to reproduce this technique met with mixed results.&lt;ref name=Nikodem_1993&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nikodem V, Danziger D, Gebka N, Gulmezoglu A, Hofmeyr G |title=Do cabbage leaves prevent breast engorgement? A randomized, controlled study |journal=Birth |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=61–64 |year=1993 |pmid=8240608 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-536X.1993.tb00418.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s or [[paracetamol]] (acetominophen) may relieve the pain.

=== Nipple pain ===
Sore [[nipples]] (nipple pain, or thelalgia) are probably the most common complaint after the birth. They are generally reported by the second day after delivery but improve within 5 days.&lt;ref name=Ziemer_1990&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ziemer M, Paone J, Schupay J, Cole E |title=Methods to prevent and manage nipple pain in breastfeeding women |journal=West J Nurs Res |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=732–43; discussion 743–44 |year=1990 |pmid=2275191 |doi=10.1177/019394599001200603}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pain beyond the first week, severe pain, cracking, fissures or localized swelling is not normal. The mother should see a doctor for further evaluation. Sore nipples, a common cause of pain, often come from the baby not latching on properly. Factors include too much pressure on the nipple when not enough of the areola is latched onto and an improper release of suction at the end of the feeding. Improper use of breast pumps or topical remedies can also contribute.&lt;ref name=Cable_1997&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cable B, Stewart M, Davis J |title=Nipple wound care: a new approach to an old problem |journal=J Hum Lact |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=313–18 |year=1997 |pmid=9429367 |doi=10.1177/089033449701300417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nipple pain can also be a sign of infection.&lt;ref name="Amir_2006"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1159/000292031 | author = Amir L |author2=Garland S|author3=Dennerstein L|author4=Farish S | title = Candida albicans: is it associated with nipple pain in lactating women? | journal = Gynecol Obstet Invest | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages =30–34 | publisher = Karger | year = 1996 | pmid = 8821881}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the baby bites the nipple it can also be painful.

=== Candidiasis ===
Symptoms of [[candidiasis]] of the breast include pain, [[pruritus|itching]], burning and redness, or a shiny or white patchy appearance.&lt;ref name=Wiener&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiener|first1=Sharon|title=Diagnosis and management of Candida of the nipple and breast.|journal=Journal of midwifery &amp; women's health|date=March–April 2006|volume=51|issue=2|pages=125–28|pmid=16504910|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/527409_3|doi=10.1016/j.jmwh.2005.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The baby could have a white tongue that does not wipe clean. Candidiasis is common and may be associated with infant [[candidiasis|thrush]].

Both mother and baby must be treated to get rid of this infection.&lt;ref name="Wiener" /&gt; First-line therapies include [[nystatin]], [[ketaconazole]] or [[miconazole]] applied to the nipple and given by mouth to the baby.&lt;ref name="Wiener" /&gt; Strict cleaning of clothing and breast pumps is also required to eradicate the infection.&lt;ref name="Tanguay_1994"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tanguay K, McBean M, Jain E |title=Nipple candidiasis among breastfeeding mothers. Case-control study of predisposing factors |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=40 |issue= |pages=1407–13 |year=1994 |pmid=8081120 |pmc=2380126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another non-prescription treatment of candidia is gentian violet.&lt;ref name="Wiener" /&gt; It usually works, and relief is rapid. It is messy, and will stain clothing. The baby's lips will turn purple, but the purple will disappear after a few days.

=== Milk stasis ===
Milk stasis is when a milk duct is blocked and cannot drain properly. This may affect only a part of the breast and is not associated with any infection. It can be treated by varying the baby's feeding position and applying heat before feeding. If it happens more than once, further evaluation is needed.

=== Mastitis ===
{{Main|Puerperal mastitis}}
Mastitis is an [[inflammation]] of the breast. It causes local pain (''dolor''), redness (''rubor''), swelling (''tumor''), and warmth (''calor''). Later stages of mastitis cause symptoms of systemic [[infection]] like fever and nausea. It mostly occurs 2–3 weeks after delivery but can happen at any time.&lt;ref name=Kinlay_1998&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Evans M, Heads J |title=Incidence of mastitis in breastfeeding women during the six months after delivery: a prospective cohort study |journal=Med J Aust |volume=170 |issue=4 |page=192 |year=1999 |pmid=10078195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically results from milk stasis with primary or secondary local, later systemic [[infection]]. Infectious organisms include ''[[Staphylococcus]] sp.'', ''[[Streptococcus]] sp.'' and ''[[E. coli]]''. Continued breastfeeding, plenty of rest and adequate fluid supply is the best treatment for light cases.

===Overactive let-down===
{{main|Overactive let-down}}
Overactive let-down (OALD) is the forceful ejection of milk from the breast during breastfeeding. The forceful spray of milk can cause the baby to consume too much milk too quickly as well as to swallow air during the period of rapid swallowing following the let-down.

===Raynaud's of the nipple===
{{main|Raynaud's of the nipple}}

Very rarely, nipple pain can be caused by [[vasospasm]] of the nipple. In essence, blood does not flow properly to the nipple which causes the nipple to blanch. This can be caused by trauma to the nipple through early breastfeeding or candidal infection of the nipple. The pain is intense during the latch stage and in between breastfeeding sessions there is a throbbing pain when the nipple is blanched. The nipple can be massaged to help blood flow return to reduce pain, as well as avoiding cold. In some instances, heart medication, nifedipine, is used to help the blood flow return to the nipple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kernerman|first=Edith|title=Vasospasm and Raynaud's Phenomenon|url=http://www.breastfeedinginc.ca/content.php?pagename=doc-V-RP|work=Centre for Breastfeeding Education|access-date=2012-10-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318172036/http://www.breastfeedinginc.ca/content.php?pagename=doc-V-RP#|archive-date=2012-03-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infant health problems ==
Infants with classic [[galactosemia]] cannot digest lactose and therefore cannot benefit from breast milk.&lt;ref name="CDC_Contra" /&gt; Breastfeeding might harm the baby also if the mother has untreated pulmonary [[tuberculosis]], is taking certain medications that suppress the [[immune system]].&lt;ref name="CDC_Contra" /&gt; has [[human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]],&lt;ref name="CDC_Contra"&gt;{{cite web | title = When should a mother avoid breastfeeding? | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = 2006-08-26 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/disease/contraindicators.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Unicef_HIV"&gt;{{cite web | title = HIV and Infant Feeding | publisher = Unicef | url = http://www.unicef.org/programme/breastfeeding/hiv.htm | accessdate = 2006-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or uses potentially harmful substances such as [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and [[amphetamine]]s.&lt;ref name=Gartner_2005 /&gt; Other than cases of acute poisoning, no environmental contaminant has been found to cause more harm to infants than lack of breastfeeding. Although [[heavy metals]] such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]] are dispersed throughout the environment and are of concern to the nursing infant, the neurodevelopmental benefits of human milk tend to override the potential adverse effects of neurotoxicants.&lt;ref name=Mead/&gt;

===Weak sucking reflex===
Artificial teats (nipples) or [[Pacifier|dummies (pacifiers)]] can suppress the sucking reflex in infants. In addition, when a baby is put to the breast for shorter periods of time, milk production decreases. The time spent sucking by the infant on the pacifier or artificial teat reduces the time on the breast.&lt;ref name="Sanches_2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sanches MTC |title= Clinical management of oral disorders in breastfeeding |journal=J Pediatr (Rio J) |volume=80 |issue=5 Suppl |pages=S155–62 |year=2004 |doi=10.1590/S0021-75572004000700007 | pmid=15583766}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marmet_2000"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Marmet C |author2=Shell E|author3=Aldana S | title=Assessing infant suck dysfunction: case management | journal=Journal of Human Lactation | volume=16 | issue=4 | pages= 332–36 | year=2000 | pmid=11188682 | doi=10.1177/089033440001600409}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JaafarHo2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaafar|first1=Sharifah Halimah|last2=Ho|first2=Jacqueline J|last3=Jahanfar|first3=Shayesteh|last4=Angolkar|first4=Mubashir|last5=Jaafar|first5=Sharifah Halimah|title=Effect of restricted pacifier use in breastfeeding term infants for increasing duration of breastfeeding|year=2016|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007202.pub4 |pmid=27572944|issue=8|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|page=CD007202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not safe for mothers with active, untreated [[tuberculosis]] to breastfeed until they are no longer contagious.&lt;ref name=Gartner_2005 /&gt; According to the American Academy of Pediatrics 2006 Redbook: {{cquote|Women with tuberculosis who have been treated appropriately for 2 or more weeks and who are not considered contagious may breastfeed. Women with tuberculosis disease suspected of being contagious should refrain from breastfeeding or any other close contact with the infant because of potential transmission through respiratory tract droplets (see Tuberculosis, p 678). ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' rarely causes mastitis or a breast abscess, but if a breast abscess caused by ''M. tuberculosis'' is present, breastfeeding should be discontinued until the mother no longer is contagious.}}

In areas where BCG vaccination is the standard of care, the [[WHO]] provides treatment recommendations and advises mothers to continue breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="WHO_Tub"&gt;[http://www.who.int/child-adolescent-health/New_Publications/NUTRITION/Breastfeeding_Tub.pdf The WHO] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107232833/http://www.who.int/child-adolescent-health/New_Publications/NUTRITION/Breastfeeding_Tub.pdf |date=November 7, 2006 }} on Breastfeeding and maternal tuberculosis; acquired 2006-08-19&lt;/ref&gt; TBC may be congenital, or perinatally acquired through airborne droplet spread.&lt;ref name="Nemir_1985"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nemir R, O'Hare D |title=Congenital tuberculosis.

==== HIV ====
{{main|Breastfeeding by HIV infected mothers}}
Research published in the [[The Lancet|Lancet]]&lt;ref name="Coovadia_2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Coovadia, HM |author2=Rollins, NC |author3=Bland, RM |author4=Little, K |author5=Coutsoudis, A |author6=Bennish, ML |author7=Newell, M |title= Mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 infection during exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months of life: an intervention cohort study|journal=The Lancet |volume=369|issue=9567 | pages=1107–16 |year=2007|doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60283-9 |pmid=17398310}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6507309.stm Breastfeeding alone cuts HIV risk]&lt;/ref&gt; has highlighted a lower risk of HIV transmission with exclusive breastfeeding by HIV positive mothers (4% risk), compared to [[breastfeeding#Mixed feeding|mixed feeding]] (10-40% risk). Research on the timing of HIV transmission in 2000 revealed that a "substantial transmission occurs early during breastfeeding," concluding that 75% of all breast milk transmission had occurred within the first 6 months during a randomized control trial in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nduati R | year = 2000 | title = Effect of Breastfeeding and Formula Feeding on Transmission of HIV-1, A Randomized Clinical Trial | url = | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 283 | issue = 9| pages = 1167–74| doi=10.1001/jama.283.9.1167|display-authors=etal | pmid=10703779}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research is of particular importance in developing countries where [[infant formula]] is not widely available or safe to prepare. In fact, the World Health Organization recommended breastfeeding in 1987 and 1992 for seropositive and seronegative women in areas where [[malnutrition]] and [[infectious diseases]] are the major cause of infant mortality.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization.  ''Statement from the Consultation on Breast-feeding/Breast Milk and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)''. Geneva, Switzerland: WHO; 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Global Programme on AIDS. Consensus statement from the WHO/UNICEF consultation on HIV transmission and breast-feeding. ''Weekly Epidemiol Rec''. 1992; 67:177–179.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 UNAIDS issued a recommendation that women in [[developing countries]] consider the risks and benefits of each feeding practice on an individual level; they recommended women make an informed choice about infant feeding.&lt;ref&gt;Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS. HIV and infant feeding. ''Wkly Epidemiol Rec''. 1996; 71:289–291.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the days before the AIDS epidemic was clearly understood, some researchers pointed to the need to increase breastfeeding rates and pointed to the risks of formula feeding, citing increased rates of marasmus and diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;Jelliffe, D, Jelliffe, E Feeding Young Infants in Developing Countries:  Comments on the Current Situation and Future Needs. ''Studies in Family Planning'' (1978). Vol 9, No. 8: 227–229&lt;/ref&gt; D Jelliffe and E Jelliffe also criticized the marketing of infant formulas by US companies to resource-poor countries, something they termed "comerciogenic malnutrition." A more recent article from 1992 describes how the health of an infant can be compromised by water, which in many resource-poor countries holds the risk of environmental pathogens that are not present in breastmilk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.an.21.100192.001131 |author1=Dettwyler K |author2=Fishman C | year = 1992 | title = Infant Feeding Practices and Growth | url = | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 171–204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmission of drugs and toxins===
{{Main|Breastfeeding and medications}}

==== Medications ====
The vast majority of over the counter and prescription medicines are compatible with breastfeeding, but there are some that might be passed onto the child through the milk.&lt;ref name="AAP_CoD"&gt;{{cite journal | author = American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Drugs | title = The Transfer of Drugs and Other Chemicals Into Human Milk | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 108 | issue = 3 | pages =776–789 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11533352 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tobacco smoke====
{{See also|Women and smoking#Unique gender differences and health effects for Females}}
If one does continue [[tobacco smoking]] after giving birth, however, it is still more beneficial to [[breastfeed]] than to completely avoid this practice altogether. There is evidence that breastfeeding offers protection against many [[infectious diseases]], especially diarrhea. Even in babies exposed to the harmful effects of nicotine through breast milk, the likelihood of acute respiratory illness is significantly diminished when compared to infants whose mothers smoked but were formula fed.&lt;ref name="menella"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mennella JA | year = 2007 | title = Breastfeeding and Smoking: Short-term Effects on Infant Feeding and Sleep | url = | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 120 | issue = 3| pages = 497–502 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1542/peds.2007-0488 | pmid=17766521 | pmc=2277470}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless, the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the risks of nicotine exposure.

The main concern about smoking and breastfeeding is that infants may have smoking-induced reductions to the milk iodine content.&lt;ref name="menella"/&gt;  Smoking can adversely affect the [[lactation]] process by decreasing milk production and altering the milk composition. Smoking reduces daily milk output by roughly 250–300&amp;nbsp;mL.  Not only will this be problematic on a daily basis for not producing enough milk, it will also cause the mother to wean her baby early.&lt;ref name="najdawi"&gt;Najdawi, F and Faouri, M 1999. Maternal smoking and breastfeeding. Eastern
Mediterranean Health Journal. 5(3): 450-456&lt;/ref&gt;  The altered milk composition also caused infants to exhibit daily behaviors such as [[colic]] and crying which can promote early weaning, again something that is not beneficial to the infant.&lt;ref name="menella"/&gt;

Also, the nicotine obtained from smoking travels through a woman into her breast milk, thus giving nicotine to her child.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/news/speeches/06272006a.html U.S. Surgeon General's Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806133133/http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/news/speeches/06272006a.html# |date=2011-08-06 }} ([http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/secondhandsmoke/report/chapter5.pdf Chapter 5]; pp.  180–194).&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy use of [[cigarette]]s by the mother (more than 20 per day) has been shown to reduce the mother's milk supply and cause vomiting, [[diarrhea|diarrhoea]], rapid heart rate, and restlessness in breastfed infants. [[Sudden Infant Death Syndrome]] (SIDS) is more common in babies exposed to a smoky environment.&lt;ref name=Gunn_2000&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gunn A, Gunn T, Mitchell E |title=CLINICAL REVIEW ARTICLE: Is changing the sleep environment enough?

==== Other substance abuse ====
With respect to alcohol, the American Academy of Pediatrics states that when breastfeeding, "moderation is definitely advised" and recommends waiting for 2 hours after drinking before nursing or pumping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/fetal-alcohol-spectrum-disorders-toolkit/Pages/Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx#ques24| title = Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Toolkit Frequently Asked Questions | author = American Academy of Pediatrics |access-date = 15 Nov 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 review found that "even in a theoretical case of binge drinking, the children would not be subjected to clinically relevant amounts of alcohol [through breastmilk]", and would have no adverse effects on children as long as drinking is "occasional".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid = 24118767 |doi = 10.1111/bcpt.12149 |volume = 114 |issue = 2 |title = Alcohol and breastfeeding. |date = Feb 2014 |journal = Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol |pages = 168–73 |author=Haastrup MB, Pottegård A, Damkier P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the mother consumes too much caffeine, it can cause irritability, sleeplessness, nervousness and increased feeding in the breastfed infant. Moderate use (one to two cups per day of coffee, tea, or cola) usually produces no effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/files/documents/your-guide-to-breastfeeding.pdf|title=Your Guide to Breastfeeding|last=Office of Women's Health.|first=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|date=|website=www.womenshealth.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breastfeeding mothers are advised to restrict or avoid caffeine if her baby reacts negatively to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Things-to-Avoid-When-Breastfeeding.aspx|title=Things to Avoid When Breastfeeding|website=HealthyChildren.org|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cigarette smoking is thought to increase the effects of caffeine in the baby.&lt;ref name=Lawrence&gt;{{cite book | last = Lawrence | first = Ruth A |author2=Lawrence, Robert M | title = Breastfeeding: A Guide for the Medical Profession |page=369 | edition = 5th | publisher = C.V. Mosby | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-8151-2615-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cannabis====
[[Cannabis]] is listed by the American Association of Pediatrics as a compound that transfers into human breast milk. Research demonstrated that certain compounds in marijuana have a very long half-life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aap.org/policy/0063.html American Association of Pediatrics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192603/http://www.aap.org/policy/0063.html |date=September 27, 2007 }} on cannabis (see table 2); acquired 2006-08-19&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diet ==
An exclusively breastfed baby depends on breast milk completely so it is important for the mother to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and especially a good diet.&lt;ref name=Tamborlane&gt;Tamborlane, et al. The Yale Guide to Children's Nutrition. Yale University Press. 1997. p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Consumption of 1500–1800 calories per day could coincide with a weight loss of 450&amp;nbsp;grams (one pound) per week.&lt;ref name=LL_FAQ_Diet&gt;{{cite web| title = How can I lose weight safely while breastfeeding?| work = | publisher = La Leche League International| url = http://www.lalecheleague.org/FAQ/diet.html| date = 2006-08-29| accessdate = 2007-02-12| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070220081636/http://www.lalecheleague.org/FAQ/diet.html#| archive-date = 2007-02-20| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While mothers in [[famine]] conditions can produce milk with highly nutritional content, a malnourished mother may produce milk with decreased levels of several micronutrients such as iron, zinc, and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Mead&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.116-a426 |author=Mead MN |title=Contaminants in human milk: weighing the risks against the benefits of breastfeeding |journal=Environ Health Perspect |volume=116 |issue=10 |pages=A426–34 |year=2008 |pmid=18941560 |url=http://www.ehponline.org/members/2008/116-10/focus.html |pmc=2569122 |access-date=2008-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106182431/http://www.ehponline.org/members/2008/116-10/focus.html# |archive-date=2008-11-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She may also have a lower supply than well-fed mothers.

There are no foods that are absolutely contraindicated during breastfeeding, but a baby may show sensitivity to particular foods that the mother eats.

== Workplaces ==
Many mothers have to return to work a short time after their babies have been born. If their employers and fellow employees do not support mothers in breastfeeding (for example, providing a private breastfeeding room containing a fridge where mothers can express and safely store breastmilk), mothers might stop breastfeeding. This is not ideal for their infants. A Cochrane review assessed the effects of workplace interventions to support and promote breastfeeding among mothers returning to work after the birth of their babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abdulwadud |first1=OA |last2=Snow |first2=ME |title=Interventions in the workplace to support breastfeeding for women in employment. |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=17 October 2012 |volume=10 |pages=CD006177 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006177.pub3 |pmid=23076920}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review authors comprehensively searched in 2012 for studies addressing this question but found no eligible studies.

===Film===
Chucky made his first appearance in the 1988 film ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]''. In the film, [[serial killer]] Charles Lee Ray ([[Brad Dourif]]) uses a voodoo ritual to transfer his soul into a Good Guy doll in an effort to escape capture. Now living in the form of the animated doll, Chucky (voiced by [[Brad Dourif|Dourif]]) is given to young [[Andy Barclay]] ([[Alex Vincent (actor)|Alex Vincent]]) and begins terrorizing the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Tom Holland (Director)|title=Child's Play|medium=DVD|location=United States|publisher=United Artists|date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chucky made his second appearance in the 1990 sequel, ''[[Child's Play 2]]''.

==Concept and creation==
{{expand section|date=October 2017}}

===Design===
''[[Child's Play (1988)|Child's Play]]'' creator and co-writer [[Don Mancini]] explained that Chucky draws heavily from the [[My Buddy (doll)|My Buddy]] dolls: "In my original script, he was originally called Buddy, and we couldn't use it because of the 'My Buddy' doll. The director went out and got a 'My Buddy' doll, a [[Raggedy Ann]], a Raggedy Andy and one of those life-size baby infants. What I told [designer] [[Kevin Yagher]] was, I wanted something similar to a My Buddy doll. I described "Buddy" in my original script, now "Chucky", as wearing red-buttoned overalls, red sneakers, striped sweater, with red hair, blue eyes, and freckles. Kevin went off and sketched many designs of Chucky, until the final was picked. Yagher then built the first doll from those sketches and my details".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chucky: Making a Nightmare|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XS_lW3Mkl9U}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coercion''' ({{IPAc-en|k|oʊ|ˈ|ɜr|ʒ|ən|,_|-|ʃ|ən}}) is the practice of forcing another party to act in an involuntary manner by use of [[threat]]s or force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coercion|title=Definition of coercion|work=Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves a set of various types of forceful actions that violate the [[free will]] of an individual to induce a desired response, for example: a bully demanding lunch money from a student or the student gets beaten. These actions may include [[extortion]], [[blackmail]], [[torture]], threats to induce favors, or even [[sexual assault]]. In law, coercion is codified as a [[duress]] crime. Such actions are used as leverage, to force the victim to act in a way contrary to their own interests. Coercion may involve the actual infliction of physical pain/injury or psychological harm in order to enhance the [[credibility]] of a threat. The threat of further harm may lead to the [[co-operation|cooperation]] or [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] of the person being coerced.

==Overview==
The purpose of coercion is to substitute one's aims to those of the victim. For this reason, many social philosophers have considered coercion as the polar opposite to [[Political freedom|freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wg1dvc2lfcEC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=%22The+purpose+of+coercion+is+to+substitute+one's+aims+to+those+of+the+victim.+For+this+reason,+many+social+philosophers+have+considered+coercion+as+the+polar+opposite+to+freedom%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20purpose%20of%20coercion%20is%20to%20substitute%20one's%20aims%20to%20those%20of%20the%20victim.%20For%20this%20reason,%20many%20social%20philosophers%20have%20considered%20coercion%20as%20the%20polar%20opposite%20to%20freedom%22&amp;f=false|title=Textbook on Legal Language and Legal Writing|last=Bhatia|first=Prof Dr K. L.|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Universal Law Publishing|isbn=9788175348943|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various forms of coercion are distinguished: first on the basis of the ''kind of injury'' threatened, second according to its ''aims'' and ''scope'', and finally according to its ''effects'', from which its legal, social, and ethical implications mostly depend.

===Physical===
Physical coercion is the most commonly considered form of coercion, where the content of the conditional threat is the [[use of force]] against a victim, their relatives or property. An often used example is "putting a gun to someone's head" (''at gunpoint'') or putting a "knife under the throat" (''at knifepoint'' or cut-throat) to compel action or the victim gets killed or injured. These are so common that they are also used as metaphors for other forms of coercion.

Armed forces in many countries use [[firing squad]]s to maintain [[discipline]] and intimidate the masses, or opposition, into submission or silent [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]]. However, there also are nonphysical forms of coercion, where the threatened injury does not immediately imply the use of force. Byman and Waxman (2000) define coercion as "the use of threatened force, including the limited use of actual force to back up the threat, to induce an adversary to behave differently than it otherwise would."&lt;ref&gt;Byman, Daniel L.; Waxman, Matthew C.: ''Kosovo and the Great Air Power Debate'', ''[[International Security]]'', Vol. 24, No. 4 (Spring, 2000), pp. 5–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Coercion does not in many cases amount to destruction of property or life since compliance is the goal.

===Psychological===
In [[psychological coercion]], the threatened injury regards the victim's relationships with other people. The most obvious example is ''[[blackmail]]'', where the threat consists of the dissemination of damaging information. However, many other types are possible e.g. "[[emotional blackmail]]", which typically involves threats of rejection from or disapproval by a peer-group, or creating feelings of guilt/obligation via a display of anger or hurt by someone whom the victim loves or respects. Another example is [[coercive persuasion]].

Psychological coercion – along with the other varieties – was extensively and systematically used by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] during the "Thought Reform" campaign of 1951–1952. The process – carried out partly at "revolutionary universities" and partly within prisons – was investigated and reported upon by [[Robert Jay Lifton]], then Research Professor of Psychiatry at Yale University: see Lifton (1961). The techniques used by the Chinese authorities included a technique derived from standard [[group psychotherapy]], which was aimed at forcing the victims (who were generally intellectuals) to produce detailed and sincere ideological "confessions". For instance, a professor of [[formal logic]] called Chin Yueh-lin – who was then regarded as China's leading authority on his subject – was induced to write: "The new philosophy [of [[Marxism-Leninism]]], being scientific, is the supreme truth" [Lifton (1961) p.&amp;nbsp;545].

'''Francoise Isabella "Francine" Agazarian''' (née Andre; 8 May 1913 &amp;ndash; 1999) was a World War II spy working with the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE).

==SOE Work==
Francine Agazarian landed in France by [[Westland Lysander|Lysander]] aircraft on 17 March 1943, along with [[Claude de Baissac]] and [[France Antelme]].&lt;ref&gt;Marucs Binney, ''The Women Who Lived for Danger: The Women Agents of SOE in the Second World War'', London, Hodder and Stoughton, 2002.  {{ISBN|0-340-81840-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was joining her husband [[Jack Agazarian]] and the [[SOE F Section networks|Prosper]] as a courier.  It was deemed unusual a married couple working on the same network; after the war Francine clarified the situation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although in the same network, my husband and I were not working together; as a radio operator he worked alone and transmitted from different locations every day. I was only responsible to Prosper (Francis Suttill) whom we all called Francois . He liked to use me for special errands because, France being my native land, I could get away from difficulties easily enough, particularly when dealing with officialdom.

Francois was an outstanding leader, clear-headed, precise, confident. I liked working on his instructions, and I enjoyed the small challenges he was placing in front of me. For instance calling at town halls in various districts of Paris to exchange the network's expired ration cards (manufactured in London) for genuine new ones. Mainly I was delivering his messages to his helpers: in Paris, in villages, or isolated houses in the countryside. From time to time I was also delivering demolition material received from England. And once, with hand-grenades in my shopping bag, I travelled in a train so full that I had to stand against a German NCO. This odd situation was not new to me. I had already experienced it for the first time on the day of my arrival on French soil, when I had to travel by train from Poitiers to Paris. A very full train also. I sat on my small suitcase in the corridor, a uniformed German standing close against me. But, that first time, tied to my waist, under my clothes, was a wide black cloth belt containing bank-notes for Prosper, a number of blank identity cards and a number of ration cards; while tucked into the sleeves of my coat were crystals for Prosper's radio transmitters; the crystals had been skilfully secured to my sleeves by Vera Atkins herself, before my departure from Orchard Court. My .32 revolver and ammunition were in my suitcase. The ludicrousness of the situation somehow eliminated any thoughts of danger.

In any case, I believe none of us in the field ever gave one thought to danger. Germans were everywhere, especially in Paris; one absorbed the sight of them and went on with the job of living as ordinarily as possible and applying oneself to one's work.

Because I worked alone, the times I liked best were when we could be together, Prosper (Francis Suttill), Denise (Andrée Borrel), Archambaud (Gilbert Norman), Marcel (Jack Agazarian) and I, sitting round a table, while I was decoding radio messages from London; we were always hoping to read the exciting warning to stand by, which would have meant that the liberating invasion from England was imminent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/SOEprosper.htm Prosper Network] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507083059/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/SOEprosper.htm |date=2008-05-07 }}, spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk; accessed 19 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the network appeared to be close to being broken by the Germans, Francine and Jack returned to England by Lysander on 16 June 1943; arriving on that flight were [[Diana Rowden]], [[Cecily Lefort]] and [[Noor Inayat Khan]]. Of the five, only Francine would survive the war. Jack returned to France, but was arrested on 30 July 1943 after falling for a German trap. He was tortured by the Gestapo for six months at Fresnes Prison and eventually sent to the [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]] where he was kept in solitary confinement and executed on 29 March 1945.

Francine Agazarian was Mentioned in Dispatches for her actions in France; her husband was also Mentioned in Dispatches and was posthumously awarded the Légion d'honneur and Croix de Guerre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.specialforcesroh.com/showthread.php?31654-Agazarian-Francoise-Isabella-(Francine)&amp;highlight=agazarian Francine Agazarian's entry in the Special Forces Roll of Honour], specialforcesroh.com; accessed 19 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guardian (James Hudson)''', also known as '''Weapon Alpha''' and '''Vindicator''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], the character made his first appearance in [[Uncanny X-Men|''The X-Men'']] #109 (February 1978) which was co-plotted by Byrne and his long-time collaborator [[Chris Claremont]]. He was designed to be the Canadian equivalent of [[Captain America]], hence his costume markings are modeled after the [[Canadian flag]]. Guardian is often confused with [[Captain Canuck]], another Canadian-themed superhero with similar costume and superpowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comicvine.com/forums/battles-7/captain-canuck-vs-guardian-1476768/ |title=Captain Canuck vs Guardian - Battles - Comic Vine |website=Comic Vine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character is the leader of [[Alpha Flight]].

==Concept and creation==
Guardian was a fan character, created by John Byrne years before he did any professional work in comics.&lt;ref name="back29"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nickerson |first=Al |title=Claremont and Byrne: The Team that Made the X-Men Uncanny |journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=29 |page=5 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |date=August 2008 |location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was originally called "the Canadian Shield", after [[Canadian Shield|the rock formation]], but when Byrne introduced the character in ''X-Men'' this name was rejected by publisher [[Marvel Comics]] because of their fictional organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Byrne then suggested "Guardian", but this was also rejected due to the numerous extant Marvel characters under that name, so ''X-Men'' scripter Chris Claremont came up with Weapon Alpha and later Vindicator.&lt;ref name="back29"/&gt; These names were used for the character's initial appearances in ''X-Men'' #109, 120-121, and 139-140. Byrne disliked both these names,&lt;ref name="back29"/&gt; and when he was assigned the writing and penciling of the newly launched ''Alpha Flight'' comic, he quickly had "Vindicator" change names to his earlier suggestion, "Guardian." 

==Fictional character biography==
James MacDonald Hudson was born in [[London, Ontario]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/universe/Guardian_%28James_Hudson%29 |title=marvel.com/universe/Guardian |publisher=Marvel.com |date=2006-10-25 |accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a leading petrochemical engineer and scientist for the Am-Can Corporation developing a [[powered armor|powered exoskeleton suit]]. When he learns that his work will be used for American military purposes, Hudson raids his workplace, steals the prototype suit and destroys the plans. He leaves the suit to be recovered (albeit without the vital control helmet, which he built before coming to the company) and fully expects to be sued and arrested for his actions.

However, Hudson's girlfriend, [[Vindicator (comics)|Heather MacNeil]], uses political connections in the [[Canadian government]] to persuade Am-Can to waive the charges against him. As a result, [[Department H]] is formed, a secret branch of the Canadian Department of National Defence, and Hudson is named as head of operations. Inspired by the debut of the [[Fantastic Four]], James Hudson planned to create a superhero team for Canada.&lt;ref name="X-Men #109"&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #109&lt;/ref&gt; He started out with a prototype superhero team called [[The Flight]] which had [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] as one of its members.&lt;ref&gt;''Alpha Flight Special'' vol. 2 #1 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his prototype team the Flight, Hudson forms [[Alpha Flight]] as a superhero team for the Canadian government and develops his exoskeleton into a battle suit. As Weapon Alpha, Hudson sought to capture Wolverine, who had left Canada and joined the [[X-Men]]. He accidentally injured [[Moira MacTaggert]] in the process.&lt;ref name="X-Men #109"/&gt; He then led Alpha Flight in battle against the X-Men to capture Wolverine.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' #120-121&lt;/ref&gt; After that mission failed, he made no further attempts to forcibly return Wolverine to Canada.

With the cancellation of Department H and its funding, Alpha Flight is temporarily disbanded. Hudson laments this for a time, but then is called to action by the arrival of the [[Great Beasts|Great Beast]] [[Tundra (Marvel Comics)|Tundra]]. He sets out alone, but Heather takes it upon herself to summon the rest of Alpha Flight, plus two recently "gold-striped" members. The team defeats Tundra, and then summarily decides to reform, albeit without direct Government support.&lt;ref&gt;''Alpha Flight'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Hudson and Alpha Flight retain their security clearances and status as RCMP Auxiliaries. They have a series of adventures, both as a team and as individuals. Early on, Hudson expresses a lack of confidence in himself, but he slowly gains some over time. For example, his initial reaction to the imposing creature the [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]] has him expressing fear. Nevertheless, he confronts the creature "like a super-hero borne"&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' #140&lt;/ref&gt;.

Though Hudson and his wife initially struggle as any Canadian middle-class couple do, he is soon offered a plum job with the large corporation Roxxon in New York City. Relocated to New York, Hudson is almost immediately trapped and set upon by an evil incarnation of [[Omega Flight]] and an old foe: his old boss from Am-Can, [[Jerry Jaxon]]. The battle is soon joined by the rest of Alpha Flight, though it does not end well for Hudson. Although seemingly killed when his battle suit explodes due to the strain of energizing a multiple teleportation matrix system (thanks to Jaxon), he is in fact transported to Jupiter's moon, [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. There he meets an alien race known as the Q`wrrlln. In their attempts to heal Hudson, the Q`wrrlln integrate his battle suit into his body, fusing it to his biological and nervous systems.&lt;ref&gt;''Alpha Flight'' #25&lt;/ref&gt; (This is originally posed as a ruse by [[Delphine Courtney]] to confuse and deceive Heather Hudson and the surviving members of Alpha Flight.&lt;ref&gt;''Alpha Flight'' #26&lt;/ref&gt;)

Hudson eventually returns to Earth and takes the name Vindicator, leaving the title of "Guardian" (and position of leadership) with his wife, Heather. Again, Hudson's time with the team is cut short when the Q'wrrlln summon him (and a select group of heroes) to protect their planet against [[Galactus]]. As before, Hudson seemingly perishes when his suit detonates while transporting the heroes back home. However, during the explosion Hudson is transported to an alternate dimension. After some time, he eventually returns to Earth.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

While again working for Department H, Hudson becomes caught up in the plans of its new director, General Jeremy Clarke. Scientists working for Clarke clone Hudson, steal his memories, and attempt to shoot his body into outer space. The plan does not succeed, though, as Hudson crash lands in [[Antarctica]].{{issue|date=July 2013}}

A seemingly de-aged Hudson reappears to the members of Alpha Flight. This is in fact the clone created by Department H. The original Hudson is eventually found by [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] in Antarctica. After his return he once again becomes team leader while the clone becomes leader of [[Beta Flight]]. Later, both Hudsons are captured by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]], and the clone is killed in the escape.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #143&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with several other members of Alpha Flight, Hudson attempts to return a clutch of [[Plodex]] eggs to their homeworld. However, an accident brings temporal copies of most of the original Alpha Flight from a time before Hudson's first "death" to the present. This group, including James Hudson, takes up the role of Alpha Flight while the original ones are helping to rebuild the Plodex homeworld.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

Alpha Flight (Sasquatch, [[Major Mapleleaf|Major Mapleleaf II]], [[Puck (comics)|Puck Jr.]], Guardian, [[Vindicator (comics)|Vindicator]], [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], and [[Puck (comics)|Puck]]) is brutally attacked by [[Xorn|The Collective]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #16&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the deaths of Guardian, Vindicator, Shaman, and Puck. Their bodies are left in the [[Yukon Territory]] as the Collective continues on to the United States.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

The Guardian suit was worn by [[Michael Pointer (comics)|Michael Pointer]] during his run in [[Omega Flight]] before joining [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]'s [[Dark X-Men]] as Weapon Omega.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Guardian (alongside Vindicator, [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], and [[Marrina Smallwood]]) are among the heroes that return from the dead following what happened to the death realms. He reunites Alpha Flight to fight the Great Beasts.&lt;ref&gt;''Chaos War: Alpha Flight''&lt;/ref&gt; James Hudson remains among the living after the defeat of the Chaos King.&lt;ref&gt;''Chaos War #5''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Formerly, Guardian used a skin-tight technological "battle suit" composed of steel mesh which served as an exoskeleton; it allowed him to fly, fire energy blasts and had a personal force field for defense. The suit design stems from a geological/oil-exploration exo-suit designed by Hudson during his early career. The original suit was clunky, over-large and awkward, though it did have an energy beam "weapon" system, ostensibly used for drilling/tunneling. The skin-tight suit is considered to be a later, possibly 2nd or 3rd generation, evolution of the original design. The battle suit is cybernetically controlled and contains a high resolution navigation system. The battle suit permits flight by directing beams of force towards the ground, propelling the wearer forward at up to Mach 1.

Guardian could cause the battle suit computers to trigger and release gravitons, canceling the Earth's rotation relative to himself, propelling himself forward at up to about 1000 miles per hour (at the equator). This effect would suspend his positioning relative to the Earth's electromagnetic field while the planet rotated, allowing him to travel West at high speed depending on his [[latitude]] positioning.

When he returned from space, the technology of the suit that formerly existed as a separate part of him was incorporated into his body. The alien Q`wrrlln converted James Hudson into a cyborg incorporating much of his battle suit; some of his mechanical parts were visible on the surface of his body. As a result, his powers were greatly enhanced. Hudson's cyborg brain was half-organic (portions of his original brain) and half-mechanical. Hudson could control his mechanical systems by mental command, though he was vulnerable to being controlled by the Q`wrrlln through the mechanical portion of his brain. With great effort the human portion of his brain could override this control.

Guardian's power suit allows for:
*increased strength and durability;
*[[cybernetic]] link-up and hacking abilities;
*advanced weapons systems, including (but not limited to) [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] pulse projectors, beams of concussive energy from the gauntlets, bolts of plasma, [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] beams, and a graviton beam;
*increased intelligence due to the fusion of his battle suit to his neural network;
*increased speed, reaching [[Mach number|Mach]] 1;
*ability to create and travel through a wormhole.
* the ability to lock himself relative to the Earth's electromagnetic field. Essentially, he cancels out the effects of the Earth's rotation upon himself. This allowed him to apparently "vanish", while actually being whisked westward at the speed of the planet's rotation.
*the creation of a protective force field that dampens inertia and absorbs energy;
*force shields that also deflect outside pressure, such as in the ocean depths;

Hudson has earned a Ph.D. in engineering. He is a brilliant engineer, inventor, and a good battle strategist and leader.

==Other versions==
*On [[Marvel Zombies (series)|Earth-2149]], a zombified Guardian can be seen attacking the X-Men alongside zombified versions of Alpha Flight. He is killed when [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] scalps him with a metal blade. His body can later be seen being examined by [[Reed Richards]] on the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]].
*On Earth-3240, where the Cold War never ended, Guardian was Heather Hudson's second husband. (Her previous husband was [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]], whom she had killed while under the control of Weapon X.) This Guardian has much the same powers as the [[Earth-616]] Guardian.
* On [[Ultimate Marvel|Earth 1610]], the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]] version of Hudson is a non-powered Gulf war veteran and sheriff of Port St. Lucie, Florida, and was acquainted with [[Ultimate Wolverine|Wolverine]], who also introduced him to his wife Heather. Wolverine entrusted him with raising his son from Magda a.k.a. "The Witch of [[Wundagore]]". Hudson named him ''James Hudson'' (which later became James Howlett, after James discovered his true father). James eventually manifested a healing factor and claws in ''[[Ultimate Comics: X]]''.

==In other media==

===Television===
* Hudson appears in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' animated series under the code name Vindicator, voiced by [[Barry Flatman]]. He conspired with the head of Alpha Flight to force Wolverine's return to Canada so they can conduct experiments on how he was able to survive the [[Adamantium|adamantium]] bonding process and, if possible, extract the adamantium from his skeleton, regardless of the possibility of killing Wolverine. He felt heavily betrayed by Wolverine leaving Alpha Flight and used that as justification for his actions. He also deceived his team into believing he was bringing Wolverine back to the team. Throughout his battle with Logan, he was able to use his force field to protect himself from Wolverine's claws. However, when it failed, he was at Logan's mercy. Wolverine told him that the only reason he was still breathing after the battle is that he loved Vindicator's wife Heather. He also threatened that, if he or Alpha Flight came after him again, all bets were off.

===Video games===
* Guardian also appears as an NPC in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]]. He and Vindicator are encountered in an abandoned Weapon X facility. He has special dialogue with Wolverine.
* Guardian appears as a playable character in ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad Online]]''.

===Toys===
*In 2008, Hasbro released an action figure of Guardian in its Marvel Legends line which was exclusive to Walmart.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3573">The '''Hydroxy/Aromatic Amino Acid Permease (HAAAP) Family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42 TC# 2.A.42]) is a member of the large [[APC Superfamily|Amino Acid-Polyamine-OrganoCation (APC) Superfamily]] of secondary carriers. Members of the HAAAP family all function in amino acid uptake. Homologues are present in a large number of [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] and [[Gram-positive bacteria]], with at least one member classified from archaea ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42.1.7 TC# 2.A.42.1.7], ''[[Thermococcus barophilus]]'')''.''

==Structure==
Proteins of the HAAAP family possess 403-443 amino acyl residues and exhibit eleven putative or established transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs).  These proteins exhibit topological features common to the eukaryotic [[AAAP Family|amino acid/auxin permease (AAAP) family]] ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.18 TC# 2.A.18]). These proteins also exhibit limited sequence similarity with some of the AAAP family members. A phylogenetic relationship has been proposed between members of the HAAAP family and APC family since they exhibit limited sequence similarity with one another.

As of early 2016, there is no crystal structural data available for members of the HAAAP family in [[Protein Data Bank|RCSB]].

==Members of the HAAAP Family==
The HAAAP family includes three well-characterized aromatic amino acid:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; symport permeases of ''E. coli'': a high affinity tryptophan-specific permease, Mtr ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42.1.2 TC# 2.A.42.1.2]), a low affinity tryptophan permease, TnaB ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42.1.3 TC# 2.A.42.1.3]), and a tyrosine-specific permease, TyrP ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42.1.1 TC# 2.A.42.1.1]), as well as two well-characterized hydroxy amino acid permeases, the serine permease, SdaC ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42.2.1 TC# 2.A.42.2.1]), of ''E. coli'', and the threonine permease, TdcC ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42.2.2 TC# 2.A.42.2.2]), of ''E. coli''.  

SdaC of ''E. coli'' (TC# 2.A.42.2.1) is also called DcrA, and together with a periplasmic protein DcrB (P37620), has been reported to play a role in phage DNA uptake in conjunction with an outer membrane receptor of the OMR family ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.B.14 TC# 1.B.14]). Thus, FhuA (TC #1.B.14.1.4) transports phage T5 DNA while BtuB ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.B.14.3.1 TC# 1.B.14.3.1]) transports phage C1 DNA (Samsonov et al., 2002). DcuB is a putative lipoprotein found only in enteric bacteria. 

All members of the HAAAP family can be found in the [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42.2 Transporter Classification Database].

==Transport Reaction==
The generalized transport reaction catalyzed by proteins of the HAAAP family is:

Amino acid (out) + nH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → Amino acid (in) + nH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in).

'''Harold Edward Welsh''' (May 5, 1896 &amp;ndash; May 20, 1943) was a politician in [[Ontario]], Canada. He was a [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] from 1936 to 1943 who represented the eastern Ontario riding of [[Hastings East (provincial electoral district)|Hastings East]].

==Background==
The son of William Frederick Welsh and Caroline Mabel Oatwater, he was born in [[Moira, Ontario]] and was educated at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name="normandin"&gt;{{cite book |title=Canadian Parliamentary Guide, 1939 |year=1939 |last=Normandin |first=A L}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a country doctor, living in [[Roslin, Ontario|Roslin]] and also served as [[coroner]] for [[Hastings County, Ontario|Hastings County]] and as medical officer of health for Huntingdon, Thurlow and Tyendinaga townships.&lt;ref name="cmaj"&gt;{{cite book |pmc=1827826 |title=Canadian Medical Association Journal |publisher=Canadian Medical Association |page=68 |date=July 1943 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="normandin"/&gt;

==Politics==
Welsh was elected to the assembly in 1936, defeating Liberal candidate Dr. Harold A. Boyce in a bitterly contested by-election held following the death of [[James Ferguson Hill]]. Liberal amendments altering the distribution of school taxes between public and Roman Catholic schools were a crucial issue in the by-election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Canadian Catholic Historical Association |url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/colleges/st_pauls/ccha/Back%20Issues/CCHA2002/Meehan.htm |title=The East Hastings By-Election of 1936 and the Ontario Separate School Tax Question |volume=68 |year=2002 |last=Meehan |first=Peter |pages=105–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welsh died in office; he drowned while fishing in [[Algonquin Provincial Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gRw_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VE8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6274,5411706 |page=2 |newspaper=Windsor Daily Star |title=Bitter By-election Recalled by Drowning |date=May 21, 1943 |accessdate=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Hindu Succession Act, 1956''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the Parliament of India enacted to amend and codify the law relating to [[Intestacy|intestate]] or unwilled succession, among Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs.&lt;ref name=hsa&gt;[http://chanda.nic.in/htmldocs/elibrary-new/e%20Library/hindu%20succession%20act-1956.pdf HINDU SUCCESSION ACT, 1956]&lt;/ref&gt; The Act lays down a uniform and comprehensive system of inheritance and succession into one Act. The Hindu woman's limited estate is abolished by the Act. Any property possessed by a Hindu female is to be held by her absolute property and she is given full power to deal with it and dispose it of by will as she likes. Parts of this Act was amended in 2005 by the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005.&lt;ref name=hsa2/&gt;

== Applicability ==

===As per religion===
This Act is applicable to the following:&lt;ref name=hsa/&gt;

* any person who is a [[Hindu]] by religion in any of its forms or developments including a Virashaiva, a [[Lingayatism|Lingayat]] or follower of the [[Brahmo Samaj|Brahmo]], [[Prarthana Samaj|Prarthana]] or [[Arya Samaj]];
* any person who is Buddhist, Sikh by religion; and
* to any other person who is not a Muslim, Christian, Parsi or Jew by religion unless it is proved that the concerned person would not have been governed by the Hindu Law or by any custom or usage as part of that law in respect of any of the matters dealt with herein if this Act had not been passed.

Explanation as to who shall be considered as Hindus, Buddhists, Jains or Sikhs by religion has been provided in the section:
* any child, legitimate or illegitimate, both of whose parents are Hindus, Buddhists, Jains or Sikhs by religion;
* any child, legitimate or illegitimate, one of whose parents is a Hindu, Buddhist, Jain or Sikh by religion and who is brought up as a member of the tribe, community, group or family to which such parent belongs or belonged;
* any person who is convert or re-convert to the Hindu, Buddhist, Jain or Sikh religion.

A person shall be treated as a Hindu under the Act though he may not be a Hindu by religion but is, nevertheless, a person to whom this Act applies by virtue of the provisions contained in this section.

=== As per tribe ===
However it has been provided that not withstanding the religion of any person as mentioned above, the Act shall not apply to the members of any Scheduled Tribe within the meaning of clause (25) of article 366 of the [[Constitution of India]] unless the [[Government of India|Central Government]], by notification in the ''Official Gazette'', otherwise directs.

== In the case of males ==
The property of a Hindu male dying intestate, or without a will, would be given first to heirs within Class I. If there are no heirs categorized as Class I, the property will be given to heirs within Class II. If there are no heirs in Class II, the property will be given to the deceased's agnates or relatives through male lineage. If there are no agnates or relatives through the male’s lineage, then the property is given to the cognates, or any relative through the lineage of males or females.

There are two classes of heirs that are delineated by the Act.

'''Class I''' heirs are sons, daughters, widows, mothers, sons of a pre-deceased son, widows of a pre-deceased son, son of a, pre-deceased sons of a predeceased son, and widows of a pre-deceased son of a predeceased son.

If there is more than one widow, multiple surviving sons or multiples of any of the other heirs listed above, each shall be granted one share of the deceased’s property. Also if the widow of a pre-deceased son, the widow of a pre-deceased son of a pre-deceased son or the widow of a brother has remarried, she is not entitled to receive the inheritance.

'''Class II''' heirs are categorized as follows and are given the property of the deceased in the following order:
# Father
# Son's / daughter's son
# Son's / daughter's daughter
# Brother
# Sister
# Daughter's / son's son
# Daughter's / son's daughter
# Daughter's / daughter's son
# Daughter's /daughter's daughter
# Brother's son
# Sister's son
# Brother's daughter

== In the case of females ==
Under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956,&lt;ref name=hsa/&gt; females are granted ownership of all property acquired either before or after the signing of the Act, abolishing their "limited owner" status. However, it was not until the 2005 Amendment that daughters were allowed equal receipt of property as with sons. This invariably grants females property rights.

The property of a Hindu female dying intestate, or without a will, shall devolve in the following order:
# upon the sons and daughters (including the children of any pre-deceased son or daughter) and the husband,
# upon the heirs of the husband.
# upon the father and mother
#upon the heirs of the father, and
# upon the heirs of the mother.

== Certain exceptions ==
Any person who commits murder is disqualified from receiving any form of inheritance from the victim.

If a relative converts from Hinduism, he or she is still eligible for inheritance. The descendants of that converted relative, however, are disqualified from receiving inheritance from their Hindu relatives, unless they have converted back to Hinduism before the death of the relative.

== Amendment ==
[[The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005]],&lt;ref name=hsa2&gt;[http://www.hrln.org/admin/issue/subpdf/HSA_Amendment_2005.pdf THE HINDU SUCCESSION (AMENDMENT) ACT, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; amended Section 4, Section 6, Section 23, Section 24 and Section 30 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. It revised rules on coparcenary property, giving daughters of the deceased equal rights with sons, and subjecting them to the same liabilities and disabilities. The amendment essentially furthers equal rights between males and females in the legal system.

In [[genetic algorithm]]s, '''inheritance''' is the ability of modeled objects to [[mating|mate]], [[mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutate]] (similar to [[biology|biological]] [[mutation]]), and propagate their problem solving [[gene]]s to the next [[generation]], in order to produce an evolved solution to a particular problem. The [[selection (genetic algorithm)|selection]] of objects that will be inherited from in each successive generation is determined by a [[fitness function]], which varies depending upon the problem being addressed.&lt;ref name="Stuart Norvig 1995"&gt;Russell, Stuart J.; Norvig, Peter (1995). ''[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]''. Englewood Heights, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

The traits of these objects are passed on through [[chromosome]]s by a means similar to biological [[reproduction]]. These chromosomes are generally represented by a series of [[gene]]s, which in turn are usually represented using [[binary number]]s. This propagation of traits between generations is similar to the inheritance of [[phenotypic trait|traits]] between generations of biological [[organism]]s. This process can also be viewed as a form of [[reinforcement learning]], because the [[evolution]] of the objects is driven by the passing of traits from successful objects which can be viewed as a [[reinforcement|reward]] for their success, thereby promoting beneficial traits.&lt;ref name="Stuart Norvig 1995" /&gt;

== Process ==
Once a new generation is ready to be created, all of the individuals that have been successful and have been chosen for reproduction are randomly paired together. Then the traits of these individuals are passed on through a combination of [[crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]] and mutation.&lt;ref name="Stuart Norvig 1995" /&gt; This process follows these basic steps:

# Pair off successful objects for mating.
# Determine randomly a crossover point for each pair.
# Switch the genes after the crossover point in each pair.
# Determine randomly if any genes are mutated in the child objects.

After following these steps, two child objects will be produced for every pair of parent objects used. Then, after determining the success of the objects in the new generation, this process can be repeated using whichever new objects were most successful. This will usually be repeated until either a desired generation is reached or an object that meets a minimum desired result from the fitness function is found.

While crossover and mutation are the common [[genetic operator]]s used in inheritance, there are also other operators such as regrouping and colonization-extinction.&lt;ref&gt;Akbari, Ziarati (2010). "A multilevel evolutionary algorithm for optimizing numerical functions" IJIEC 2 (2011): 419&amp;ndash;430  [http://growingscience.com/ijiec/Vol2/IJIEC_2010_11.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Example ===
Assume these two strings of bits represent the traits being passed on by two parent objects:

* Object 1: 1100011010110001
* Object 2: 1001100110011001

Now, consider that the crossover point is randomly positioned after the fifth bit:

* Object 1: 11000 | 11010110001
* Object 2: 10011 | 00110011001

During crossover, the two objects will swap all of the bits after the crossover point, leading to:

* Object 1: 11000 | 00110011001
* Object 2: 10011 | 11010110001

Finally, mutation is simulated on the objects by there being zero or more bits flipped randomly. Assuming the tenth bit for object 1 is mutated, and the second and seventh bits are mutated for object 2, the final children produced by this inheritance would be:

* Object 1: 1100000111011001
* Object 2: 1101110010110001

'''Isaako Aaitui''' (born January 25, 1987) is an [[American football]] [[nose tackle]] who is currently a free agent. He was originally signed by the [[Miami Dolphins]] as an [[undrafted free agent]] in 2011. He played [[college football]] at [[UNLV Rebels football|UNLV]].

==Early years==
Aaitui attended Faga'itua High School in Pago Pago, where he played [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[volleyball]] and [[Association football|soccer]] in addition to [[high school football|football]] prior to graduating in 2006.&lt;ref name="UNLVBio"&gt;{{cite web | title = Player Bio: Isaako Aaitui | work = UNLVRebels.com | url = http://www.unlvrebels.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/aaitui_isaako00.html | accessdate = 17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College career==
After redshirting at [[UNLV Rebels football|UNLV]] in 2006, Aaitui made his Rebels debut in 2007, appearing in seven games and recording 10 tackles (two for a loss).&lt;ref name="UNLVBio"/&gt; He started nine of 12 games played as a sophomore in 2008, totaling 32 tackles (14 solo), leading the team with seven tackles for a loss and tying for the team lead with two sacks.&lt;ref name="UNLVBio"/&gt;

Aaitui started 10 of 12 games at defensive tackle as a junior in 2009, recording 31 tackles and 2.5 tackles for a loss.&lt;ref name="UNLVBio"/&gt; He closed out his collegiate career with 27 tackles (5 for a loss), 1.5 sacks, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery and a blocked kick.&lt;ref name="UNLVBio"/&gt;

==Professional career==

===First stint with Dolphins===
After going undrafted in the [[2012 NFL Draft]], Aaitui did not attend training camp and did not sign with a team until joining the [[practice squad]] of the [[Miami Dolphins]] on October 5, 2011.&lt;ref name="PracticeSquad"&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins sign OT Will Barker away from Buccaneers; make practice squad moves | work = Phins-Spotlight.com | url = http://www.phins-spotlight.com/2011/10/dolphins-sign-ot-will-barker-away-from.html | accessdate = 17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained on the practice squad the rest of his rookie season and was re-signed to a future contract in January 2012.&lt;ref name="FutureDeal"&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins re-sign seven to future contracts | work = Phins-Spotlight.com | url = http://www.phins-spotlight.com/2012/01/dolphins-sign-seven-to-future-contracts.html | accessdate = 17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaitui's attempt to make the Dolphins' roster in 2012 was documented on the [[Home Box Office|HBO]] series ''[[Hard Knocks (TV series)|Hard Knocks: Training Camp with the Miami Dolphins]]''.&lt;ref name="HardKnocks"&gt;{{cite web | title = Hard Knocks' Isaako Aaitui waived by Jets after injury | work = NFL.com | url = http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000058465/article/hard-knocks-isaako-aaitui-waived-by-jets-after-injury | accessdate = 17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He came up just short of earning a roster spot and was waived by the team during final cuts, with the organization hoping to retain him on the practice squad.&lt;ref name="HardKnocks"/&gt;

===New York Jets===
After being waived by the Dolphins, Aaitui made his first NFL roster when he was claimed by the [[New York Jets]] on September 2.&lt;ref name="HardKnocks"/&gt; However, he suffered a [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|torn ACL]] and [[Medial knee injuries|MCL]] in his first practice with the Jets and was subsequently waived two days later.&lt;ref name="HardKnocks"/&gt;

===New Orleans Saints===
After spending the 2012 season out of football with a knee injury, Aaitui signed a two-year contract with the [[New Orleans Saints]] in May 2013.&lt;ref name="Saints"&gt;{{cite web | title = New Orleans Saints Agree To Terms With DT Isaako Aaitui | work = NewOrleansSaints.com | url = http://www.neworleanssaints.com/news-and-events/article-1/New-Orleans-Saints-Agree-To-Terms-With-DT-Isaako-Aaitui/155a78ec-3b5f-410f-b886-f41588c7c650 | accessdate = 17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was once again waived during final cuts on August 31.&lt;ref name="SaintsWaived"&gt;{{cite web | title = Saints Roster Cuts 2013: Saints Waive Isaako Aaitui | work = CanalStreetChronicles.com | url = http://www.canalstreetchronicles.com/2013/8/31/4680182/saints-roster-cuts-2013-isaako-aaitui | accessdate = 17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second stint with Dolphins===
Aaitui was re-signed by the Dolphins on September 17, 2013 to provide depth at the defensive tackle position due to an injury to [[Paul Soliai]].&lt;ref name="RejoinsDolphins"&gt;{{cite web | title = With Soliai sidelined, Dolphins bring back Isaako Aaitui, Al Lapuaho | work = FinNation.com | url = http://finnation.com/soliai-sidelined-dolphins-bring-back-isaako-aaitui-al-lapuaho/ | accessdate = 17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to the active roster on October 19 after the release of [[Marvin Austin]].&lt;ref name="DolphinsPromotion"&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins promote DT Isaako Aaitui to the 53-man roster | work = The Sun Sentinel | url = http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/dolphins-blog/sfl-dolphins-promote-dt-isaako-aaitui-to-the-53man-roster-20131019,0,3339645.story | accessdate = 17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaitui made his NFL debut the following day, participating in 19 defensive snaps in the team's home loss to the [[Buffalo Bills]].&lt;ref name="NFLDebut"&gt;{{cite web | title = Bills vs Dolphins final look: Miami defensive snap counts | work = ThePhinsider.com | url = http://www.thephinsider.com/2013/10/23/4947176/bills-vs-dolphins-final-look-miami-defensive-snap-counts | accessdate = 17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Washington Redskins===
Aaitui signed with the [[Washington Redskins]] practice squad on December 16, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kring-Schreifels|first1=Jake|title=More On New Redskin Isaako Aaitui|url=http://blog.redskins.com/2014/12/16/more-on-new-redskin-isaako-aaitui/|publisher=Redskins.com|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed a [[futures contract]] on December 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=WashingtonPost.com|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/football-insider/wp/2014/12/29/redskins-sign-eight-players-to-futures-contracts/|title=Redskins sign eight players to futures contracts|first=Mike|last=Jones|date=December 29, 2014|accessdate=2014-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="112723">This section of the [[list of rampage killers]] contains those cases that either occurred mostly within a single household, or where most of the victims were members of a single family not related to the perpetrator. Cases where the primary motive for the murders was to facilitate or cover up another felony, like robbery, are not included.

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* In all cases the perpetrator is not counted among those killed or injured.

All abbreviations used in the table are explained [[#Abbreviations and footnotes|below]]. &lt;!--Additions should be made 1) in order of # of fatalities, and 2) # injured--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2823">The '''Maes–Garreau law''' is the statement that "most favorable predictions about future technology will fall within the Maes–Garreau point", defined as "the latest possible date a prediction can come true and still remain in the lifetime of the person making it".&lt;ref name="kk"&gt;Kevin Kelly: [http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2007/03/the_maesgarreau.php The Maes–Garreau Point] March 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, it relates to predictions of a [[technological singularity]] or other radical future technologies.&lt;ref name="kk"/&gt; 

It has been referred to as a "law of human nature",&lt;ref&gt;Michael Marshall, Five laws of human nature, New Scientist, 17 December 2009 https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18301-five-laws-of-human-nature.html&lt;/ref&gt; although Kelly's evidence is anecdotal.

==Origin==
[[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], editor of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, created the law in 2007 after being influenced by [[Pattie Maes]] at [[MIT]] and [[Joel Garreau]] (author of ''[[Radical Evolution]]'').&lt;ref name="kk"/&gt;

In 1993, Maes listed a number of her colleagues at MIT that had publicly predicted [[mind uploading]] (the replication of a human brain on a computer), and noted that the innovations were generally slated to occur approximately 70 years after the birth of the predictor. As quoted by her colleague Rodney Brooks:&lt;ref name="kk"/&gt;

{{quote|She took as many people as she could find who had publicly predicted downloading of consciousness into silicon, and plotted the dates of their predictions, along with when they themselves would turn seventy years old. Not too surprisingly, the years matched up for each of them. Three score and ten years from their individual births, technology would be ripe for them to download their consciousnesses into a computer. Just in the nick of time! They were each, in their own minds, going to be remarkably lucky, to be in just the right place at the right time.}}

==Failed attempts to verify Maes-Garreau==
The [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]] released a paper detailing a much larger set of AI predictions of 95 predictions extracted from a database of 257 AI predictions, which finds a broad array of estimates significantly before and after a predictor's estimated longevity, thus contradicting the law. MIRI states a stronger rule as being "Maes-Garreau": "the predictor expects AI to be developed at the exact end of their life."&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Stuart, and Kaj Sotala. 2012.

{{Molecular nanotechnology}}

'''Molecular nanotechnology''' ('''MNT''') is a technology based on the ability to build structures to complex, atomic specifications by means of [[mechanosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-drexler.com/d/06/00/Nanosystems/glossary/glossary_n.html#Nanotechnology |title=Nanosystems Glossary |publisher=E-drexler.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is distinct from [[Nanomaterials|nanoscale materials]].  Based on [[Richard Feynman]]'s vision of miniature factories using nanomachines to build complex products ([[self-replicating machine|including additional nanomachines]]), this advanced form of [[nanotechnology]] (or ''molecular manufacturing''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wise-nano.org/w/Doing_MM |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051108122214/http://wise-nano.org/w/Doing_MM |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-11-08 |title=Doing MM |publisher=Wise Nano |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2010-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) would make use of positionally-controlled mechanosynthesis guided by [[molecular machine]] systems. MNT would involve combining physical principles demonstrated by [[biophysics]], [[chemistry]], other nanotechnologies, and the [[Biological machine|molecular machinery of life]] with the systems engineering principles found in modern macroscale factories.

==Introduction==

While conventional chemistry uses inexact processes obtaining inexact results, and biology exploits inexact processes to obtain definitive results, molecular nanotechnology would employ original definitive processes to obtain definitive results. The desire in molecular nanotechnology would be to balance molecular reactions in positionally-controlled locations and orientations to obtain desired chemical reactions, and then to build systems by further assembling the products of these reactions.

A roadmap for the development of MNT is an objective of a broadly based technology project led by [[Battelle Memorial Institute|Battelle]] (the manager of several U.S. National Laboratories) and the [[Foresight Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foresight.org/cms/press_center/282 |title=Foresight Institute press release |publisher=Foresight.org |date=2008-01-29 |accessdate=2010-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923024525/http://foresight.org/cms/press_center/282 |archivedate=2010-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The roadmap was originally scheduled for completion by late 2006, but was released in January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peterson |first=Christine |url=http://www.foresight.org/nanodot/?p=2478#more-2478 |title=Nanodot: Nanotechnology News and Discussion » Blog Archive » Nanotechnology Roadmap launch: Productive Nanosystems Conference, Oct 9-10 |publisher=Foresight.org |date=2007-05-08 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nanofactory Collaboration&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory |title=Nanofactory Collaboration |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a more focused ongoing effort involving 23 researchers from 10 organizations and 4 countries that is developing a practical research agenda&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/Challenges.htm |title=Nanofactory Technical Challenges |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically aimed at positionally-controlled diamond mechanosynthesis and diamondoid nanofactory development. In August 2005, a task force consisting of 50+ international experts from various fields was organized by the [http://www.crnano.org/ Center for Responsible Nanotechnology] to study the societal implications of molecular nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crnano.org|title=Global Task Force on Implications and Policy |publisher=Crnano.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projected applications and capabilities==

===Smart materials and nanosensors===
One proposed application of MNT is so-called [[smart material]]s.  This term refers to any sort of material designed and engineered at the [[nanometer]] scale for a specific task. It encompasses a wide variety of possible commercial applications.  One example would be materials designed to respond differently to various molecules; such a capability could lead, for example, to artificial drugs which would recognize and render inert specific [[viruses]].  Another is the idea of [[Self-healing material|self-healing structures]], which would [[Regeneration (biology)|repair]] small tears in a surface naturally in the same way as self-sealing tires or human skin.

A MNT nanosensor would resemble a smart material, involving a small component within a larger machine that would react to its environment and change in some fundamental, intentional way.  A very simple example: a photosensor might passively measure the incident light and discharge its absorbed energy as electricity when the light passes above or below a specified threshold, sending a signal to a larger machine.  Such a sensor would supposedly cost less and use less power than a conventional sensor, and yet function usefully in all the same applications &amp;mdash; for example, turning on parking lot lights when it gets dark.

While smart materials and nanosensors both exemplify useful applications of MNT, they pale in comparison with the complexity of the technology most popularly associated with the term: the replicating [[nanorobot]].

===Replicating nanorobots===

MNT nanofacturing is popularly linked with the idea of [[swarm intelligence|swarm]]s of coordinated nanoscale robots working together, a popularization of an early proposal by [[K. Eric Drexler]] in his [[Engines of Creation|1986 discussions of MNT]], but [http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/Nanosystems/toc.html superseded in 1992]. In this early proposal, sufficiently capable nanorobots would construct more nanorobots in an artificial environment containing special molecular building blocks.

Critics have doubted both the feasibility of self-replicating [[nanorobot]]s and the feasibility of control if self-replicating nanorobots could be achieved: they cite the possibility of [[mutation]]s removing any control and favoring reproduction of mutant pathogenic variations.  Advocates address the first doubt by pointing out that the first macroscale autonomous machine replicator, made of [[Lego blocks]], was built and operated experimentally in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.23.4.htm |title=3.23.4 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While there are sensory advantages present at the macroscale compared to the limited sensorium available at the nanoscale, proposals for positionally controlled nanoscale mechanosynthetic fabrication systems employ dead reckoning of tooltips combined with reliable reaction sequence design to ensure reliable results, hence a limited sensorium is no handicap;  similar considerations apply to the positional assembly of small nanoparts.  Advocates address the second doubt by arguing that [[bacterium|bacteria]] are (of necessity) evolved to evolve, while nanorobot mutation could be actively prevented by common [[Error-correction|error-correcting]] techniques. Similar ideas are advocated in the Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/guidelines/index.html |title=Molecular Nanotechnology Guidelines |publisher=Foresight.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a map of the 137-dimensional replicator design space&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.1.9.htm |title=5.1.9 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; recently published by Freitas and Merkle provides numerous proposed methods by which replicators could, in principle, be safely controlled by good design.

However, the concept of suppressing mutation raises the question: How can design evolution occur at the nanoscale without a process of random mutation and deterministic selection? Critics argue that MNT advocates have not provided a substitute for such a process of evolution in this nanoscale arena where conventional sensory-based selection processes are lacking.  The limits of the sensorium available at the nanoscale could make it difficult or impossible to winnow successes from failures.  Advocates argue that design evolution should occur deterministically and strictly under human control, using the conventional engineering paradigm of modeling, design, prototyping, testing, analysis, and redesign.

In any event, since 1992 [http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/Nanosystems/toc.html technical proposals for MNT] do not include self-replicating nanorobots, and recent ethical guidelines put forth by MNT advocates prohibit unconstrained self-replication.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/MMDangerous.pdf |title=N04FR06-p.15.pmd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical nanorobots===

One of the most important applications of MNT would be medical [[nanorobotics]] or [[nanomedicine]], an area pioneered by [[Robert Freitas]] in numerous books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanomedicine.com |title=NanomedicineBookSite |publisher=Nanomedicine.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/NanoPubls.htm |title=NanoPubls |publisher=Rfreitas.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ability to design, build, and deploy large numbers of medical nanorobots would, at a minimum, make possible the rapid elimination of disease and the reliable and relatively painless recovery from physical trauma.  Medical nanorobots might also make possible the convenient correction of genetic defects, and help to ensure a greatly expanded lifespan.  More controversially, medical nanorobots might be used to [[Human enhancement|augment natural human capabilities]]. One study has reported on the conditions like tumors, [[arteriosclerosis]], [[blood clots]] leading to stroke, accumulation of scar tissue and localized pockets of infection can be possibly be addressed by employing medical nanorobots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/Conferences/MNT8/Papers/Rubinstein/|title=NanoRobot for Treatment of Various Medical Problems|website=www.foresight.org|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saadeh|first=Yamaan|last2=Vyas|first2=Dinesh|date=June 2014|title=Nanorobotic Applications in Medicine: Current Proposals and Designs|journal=American journal of robotic surgery|volume=1|issue=1|pages=4–11|doi=10.1166/ajrs.2014.1010|issn=2374-0612|pmc=4562685|pmid=26361635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility fog===

[[Image:Foglet.jpg|thumb|Diagram of a 100 micrometer foglet]]
Another proposed application of molecular nanotechnology is "[[utility fog]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discuss.foresight.org/~josh/Ufog.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111094117/http://discuss.foresight.org/%7Ejosh/Ufog.html |archivedate=2006-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; in which a cloud of networked microscopic robots (simpler than [[Molecular assembler|assembler]]s) would change its shape and properties to form macroscopic objects and tools in accordance with software commands.  Rather than modify the current practices of consuming material goods in different forms, utility fog would simply replace many physical objects.

===Phased-array optics===

Yet another proposed application of MNT would be [[phased-array optics]] (PAO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phased-array.com |title=Phased Array Optics |publisher=Phased-array.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this appears to be a problem addressable by ordinary nanoscale technology. PAO would use the principle of phased-array millimeter technology but at optical wavelengths.  This would permit the duplication of any sort of optical effect but virtually.  Users could request holograms, sunrises and sunsets, or floating lasers as the mood strikes.  PAO systems were described in BC Crandall's ''Nanotechnology:  Molecular Speculations on Global Abundance'' in the [[Brian Wowk]] article "Phased-Array Optics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phased-array.com/1996-Book-Chapter.html |title=Phased Array Optics |publisher=Phased-array.com |date=1991-10-03 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential social impacts==

[[Molecular manufacturing]] is a potential future subfield of nanotechnology that would make it possible to  build complex structures at atomic precision.&lt;ref name="Foresight nano FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions - Molecular Manufacturing|url=http://www.foresight.org/nano/whatismm.html|website=foresight.org|accessdate=19 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426045511/http://www.foresight.org/nano/whatismm.html|archivedate=26 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular manufacturing requires significant advances in nanotechnology, but once achieved could produce highly advanced products at low costs and in large quantities in nanofactories weighing a kilogram or more.&lt;ref name="Foresight nano FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; When nanofactories gain the ability to produce other nanofactories production may only be limited by relatively abundant factors such as input materials, energy and software.&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;

The products of molecular manufacturing could range from cheaper, mass-produced versions of known high-tech products to novel products with added capabilities in many areas of application. Some applications that have been suggested are advanced [[smart materials]], nanosensors, medical nanorobots and space travel.&lt;ref name="Foresight nano FAQ"/&gt; Additionally, molecular manufacturing could be used to cheaply produce highly advanced, durable weapons, which is an area of special concern regarding the impact of nanotechnology.&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chris Phoenix|author2=Mike Treder|editor1-last=Bostrom|editor1-first=Nick|editor2-last=Cirkovic|editor2-first=Milan M.|title=Global catastrophic risks|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-857050-9|chapter=Chapter 21: Nanotechnology as global catastrophic risk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Being equipped with compact computers and motors these could be increasingly autonomous and have a large range of capabilities.&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;

According to Chris Phoenix and Mike Treder from the [[Center for Responsible Nanotechnology]] as well as Anders Sandberg from the [[Future of Humanity Institute]] molecular manufacturing is the application of nanotechnology that poses the most significant [[global catastrophic risk]].&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Sandberg xrisk"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sandberg |first1=Anders |title=The five biggest threats to human existence |url=http://theconversation.com/the-five-biggest-threats-to-human-existence-27053|website=http://theconversation.com/ |accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several nanotechnology researchers state that the bulk of risk from nanotechnology comes from the potential to lead to war, arms races and destructive global government.&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sandberg xrisk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drexler|first1=Eric|title=A Dialog on Dangers |url=http://www.foresight.org/Updates/Background3.html#DangerDialog|website=foresight.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several reasons have been suggested why the availability of nanotech weaponry may with significant likelihood lead to unstable arms races (compared to e.g. nuclear arms races): (1) A large number of players may be tempted to enter the race since the threshold for doing so is low;&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; (2) the ability to make weapons with molecular manufacturing will be cheap and easy to hide;&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; (3) therefore lack of insight into the other parties' capabilities can tempt players to arm out of caution or to launch preemptive strikes;&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drexler|first1=Eric|title=ENGINES OF DESTRUCTION  (Chapter 11)|url=http://e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Chapter_11.html|website=http://e-drexler.com/|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (4) molecular manufacturing may reduce dependency on international trade,&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; a potential peace-promoting factor;&lt;ref name="Tomasik promote compr"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomasik|first1=Brian|title=Possible Ways to Promote Compromise|url=http://foundational-research.org/publications/possible-ways-to-promote-compromise/#Democracy_trade_and_social_stability|website=http://foundational-research.org/|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (5) [[wars of aggression]] may pose a smaller economic threat to the aggressor since manufacturing is cheap and humans may not be needed on the battlefield.&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;

Since self-regulation by all state and non-state actors seems hard to achieve,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dangers of Molecular Manufacturing|url=http://www.crnano.org/dangers.htm|website=crnano.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; measures to mitigate war-related risks have mainly been proposed in the area of [[Multilateralism|international cooperation]].&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "crnano int control"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Need for International Control|url=http://www.crnano.org/int_control.htm|website=crnano.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; International infrastructure may be expanded giving more sovereignty to the international level. This could help coordinate efforts for arms control.&lt;ref name="Tomasik co-op vs arms race"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomasik|first1=Brian|title=International Cooperation vs. AI Arms Race|url=http://foundational-research.org/publications/international-cooperation-vs-ai-arms-race/#Nanotech_arms_races|website=foundational-research.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; International institutions dedicated specifically to nanotechnology (perhaps analogously to the International Atomic Energy Agency [[IAEA]]) or general arms control may also be designed.&lt;ref name = "crnano int control"/&gt; One may also jointly make [[Differential technological development|differential technological progress]] on defensive technologies, a policy that players should usually favour.&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; The Center for Responsible Nanotechnology also suggest some technical restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technical Restrictions May Make Nanotechnology Safer|url=http://www.crnano.org/restrictions.htm|website=crnano.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improved transparency regarding technological capabilities may be another important facilitator for arms-control.&lt;ref name="Tomasik promote compr 2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomasik|first1=Brian|title=Possible Ways to Promote Compromise|url=http://foundational-research.org/publications/possible-ways-to-promote-compromise/#Transparency_social_capital_and_karma|website=http://foundational-research.org/|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[grey goo]] is another catastrophic scenario, which was proposed by [[K. Eric Drexler|Eric Drexler]] in his 1986 book ''[[Engines of Creation]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Apocalypse 2012 |last= Joseph |first= Lawrence E. |year= 2007 |publisher= Broadway |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-7679-2448-1 |page= 6 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been analyzed by Freitas in "Some Limits to Global Ecophagy by Biovorous Nanoreplicators, with Public Policy Recommendations" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.foresight.org/nano/Ecophagy.html&lt;/ref&gt; and has been a theme in mainstream media and fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3788673.stm| title=Nanotech guru turns back on 'goo'| publisher= BBC News|accessdate=2012-03-30|first=Paul|last=Rincon|date=2004-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hapgood |first=Fred |date=November 1986 |title=Nanotechnology: Molecular Machines that Mimic Life |url=http://metamodern.com/b/wp-content/uploads/docs/OMNI_TINYTECH.pdf |journal=Omni |accessdate=19 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This scenario involves tiny self-replicating robots that consume the entire biosphere using it as a source of energy and building blocks.  Nanotech experts including Drexler now discredit the scenario. According to  [[Chris Phoenix (nanotechnologist)|Chris Phoenix]] a "So-called grey goo could only be the product of a deliberate and difficult engineering process, not an accident".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leading nanotech experts put 'grey goo' in perspective|url=http://www.crnano.org/PR-IOP.htm|website=crnano.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of nano-biotech, a different scenario called [[green goo]] has been forwarded. Here, the malignant substance is not nanobots but rather self-replicating biological [[organism]]s engineered through nanotechnology.

===Benefits===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nanotechnology (or molecular nanotechnology to refer more specifically to the goals discussed here) will let us continue the historical trends in manufacturing right up to the fundamental limits imposed by physical law. It will let us make remarkably powerful molecular computers. It will let us make materials over fifty times lighter than steel or aluminium alloy but with the same strength. We'll be able to make jets, rockets, cars or even chairs that, by today's standards, would be remarkably light, strong, and inexpensive. Molecular surgical tools, guided by molecular computers and injected into the blood stream could find and destroy cancer cells or invading bacteria, unclog arteries, or provide oxygen when the circulation is impaired.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nanotechnology will replace our entire manufacturing base with a new, radically more precise, radically less expensive, and radically more flexible way of making products. The aim is not simply to replace today's computer chip making plants, but also to replace the assembly lines for cars, televisions, telephones, books, surgical tools, missiles, bookcases, airplanes, tractors, and all the rest. The objective is a pervasive change in manufacturing, a change that will leave virtually no product untouched. Economic progress and military readiness in the 21st Century will depend fundamentally on maintaining a competitive position in nanotechnology.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the current early developmental status of nanotechnology and molecular nanotechnology,  much concern surrounds MNT's anticipated impact on [[economics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/NoninflationaryPN.pdf |title=N20FR06-p._.pmd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://lifeboat.com/ex/corporate.cornucopia&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[law]]. Whatever the exact effects, MNT, if achieved, would tend to reduce the [[scarcity]] of manufactured goods and make many more goods (such as food and health aids) manufacturable.

MNT should make possible [[Nanomedicine|nanomedical]] capabilities able to cure any medical condition not already cured by advances in other areas. Good health would be common, and poor health of any form would be as rare as [[smallpox]] and [[scurvy]] are today. Even [[cryonics]] would be feasible, as [[cryopreserved]] tissue could be fully repaired.

===Risks===
Molecular nanotechnology is one of the technologies that some analysts believe could lead to a [[technological singularity]].
Some feel that molecular nanotechnology would have daunting risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crnano.org/dangers.htm |title=Nanotechnology: Dangers of Molecular Manufacturing |publisher=Crnano.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It conceivably could enable cheaper and more destructive conventional [[weapon]]s.  Also, molecular nanotechnology might permit [[weapons of mass destruction]] that could self-replicate, as [[virus (biology)|virus]]es and [[cancer]] cells do when attacking the human body. Commentators generally agree that, in the event molecular nanotechnology were developed, its [[self-replication]] should be permitted only under very controlled or "inherently safe" conditions.

A fear exists that nanomechanical robots, if achieved, and if designed to self-replicate using naturally occurring materials (a difficult task), could consume the entire planet in their hunger for raw materials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/Ecophagy.htm |title=Some Limits to Global Ecophagy |publisher=Rfreitas.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply crowd out natural life, out-competing it for energy (as happened historically when [[blue-green algae]] appeared and outcompeted earlier life forms).  Some commentators have referred to this situation as the "[[grey goo]]" or "[[ecophagy]]" scenario.  [[K. Eric Drexler]] considers an accidental "grey goo" scenario extremely unlikely and says so in later editions of ''Engines of Creation''.

In light of this perception of potential danger, the [[Foresight Institute]], founded by Drexler, has prepared a set of guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/guidelines/current.html |title=Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology |publisher=Foresight.org |date=2006-04-06 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the ethical development of nanotechnology.  These include the banning of free-foraging self-replicating pseudo-organisms on the Earth's surface, at least, and possibly in other places.

==Technical issues and criticism==
The feasibility of the basic technologies analyzed in ''Nanosystems'' has been the subject of a formal scientific review by U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and has also been the focus of extensive debate on the internet and in the popular press.

===Study and recommendations by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences===

In 2006, U.S. National Academy of Sciences released the report of a study of molecular manufacturing as part of a longer report, ''A Matter of Size: Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative''&lt;ref name="nanotechnology1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11752.html |title=A Matter of Size: Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative |publisher=Nap.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study committee reviewed the technical content of ''Nanosystems'', and in its conclusion states that no current theoretical analysis can be considered definitive regarding several questions of potential system performance, and that optimal paths for implementing high-performance systems cannot be predicted with confidence. It recommends experimental research to advance knowledge in this area:

:"Although theoretical calculations can be made today, the eventually attainable range of chemical reaction cycles, error rates, speed of operation, and thermodynamic efficiencies of such bottom-up manufacturing systems cannot be reliably predicted at this time. Thus, the eventually attainable perfection and complexity of manufactured products, while they can be calculated in theory, cannot be predicted with confidence. Finally, the optimum research paths that might lead to systems which greatly exceed the thermodynamic efficiencies and other capabilities of biological systems cannot be reliably predicted at this time. Research funding that is based on the ability of investigators to produce experimental demonstrations that link to abstract models and guide long-term vision is most appropriate to achieve this goal."

===Assemblers versus nanofactories===
A section heading in Drexler's ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' reads&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Cover.html |title=Engines of Creation - K. Eric Drexler : Cover |publisher=E-drexler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Universal Assemblers", and the following text speaks of multiple types of [[Assembler (nanotechnology)|assemblers]] which, collectively, could hypothetically "build almost anything that the laws of nature allow to exist." Drexler's colleague [[Ralph Merkle]] has noted that, contrary to widespread legend,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/impact/impossible.html#Fear |title=How good scientists reach bad conclusions |publisher=Foresight.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drexler never claimed that assembler systems could build absolutely any molecular structure. The endnotes in Drexler's book explain the qualification "almost": "For example, a delicate structure might be designed that, like a stone arch, would self-destruct unless all its pieces were already in place. If there were no room in the design for the placement and removal of a scaffolding, then the structure might be impossible to build. Few structures of practical interest seem likely to exhibit such a problem, however."

In 1992, Drexler published ''Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/Nanosystems/toc.html |title=Nanosystems TOC |publisher=E-drexler.com |date=2002-11-01 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; a detailed proposal for synthesizing stiff covalent structures using a table-top factory. [[Diamondoid]] structures and other stiff covalent structures, if achieved, would have a wide range of possible applications, going far beyond current [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] technology. An outline of a path was put forward in 1992 for building a table-top factory in the absence of an assembler. Other researchers have begun advancing tentative, alternative proposed paths &lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; for this in the years since Nanosystems was published.

===Hard versus soft nanotechnology===
In 2004 [http://www.softmachines.org/wordpress/ Richard Jones] wrote Soft Machines (nanotechnology and life), a book for lay audiences published by [[Oxford University]]. In this book he describes radical nanotechnology (as advocated by Drexler) as a deterministic/mechanistic idea of nano engineered  machines that does not take into account the nanoscale challenges such as [[wetness]], [[Adhesion|stickiness]], [[Brownian motion]], and high [[viscosity]]. He also explains what is soft nanotechnology or more appropriatelly [[biomimetic]] nanotechnology which is the way forward, if not the best way, to design functional nanodevices that can cope with all the problems at a nanoscale. One can think of soft nanotechnology as the development of nanomachines that uses the lessons learned from biology on how things work, chemistry to precisely engineer such devices and stochastic physics to model the system and its natural processes in detail.

===The Smalley-Drexler debate===
{{main|Drexler–Smalley debate on molecular nanotechnology}}

Several researchers, including Nobel Prize winner [[Richard Smalley|Dr. Richard Smalley]] (1943–2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&amp;ARTICLEID_CHAR=F90C4210-C153-4B2F-83A1-28F2012B637|date=September 2001| journal=Scientific American| title=Of Chemistry, Love and Nanobots| first= Richard E.| last= Smalley|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0901-76| volume=285| pages=76–77| bibcode=2001SciAm.285c..76S}}&lt;/ref&gt; attacked the notion of universal assemblers, leading to a rebuttal from Drexler and colleagues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imm.org/SciAmDebate2/smalley.php |title=Debate About Assemblers — Smalley Rebuttal |publisher=Imm.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually to an exchange of letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html |title=C&amp;En: Cover Story - Nanotechnology |publisher=Pubs.acs.org |date=2003-12-01 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smalley argued that chemistry is extremely complicated, reactions are hard to control, and that a universal assembler is science fiction. Drexler and colleagues, however, noted that Drexler never proposed universal assemblers able to make absolutely anything, but instead proposed more limited assemblers able to make a very wide variety of things. They challenged the relevance of Smalley's arguments to the more specific proposals advanced in ''Nanosystems''.  Also, Smalley argued that nearly all of modern chemistry involves reactions that take place in a [[solvent]] (usually [[water]]), because the [[small molecules]] of a solvent contribute many things, such as lowering [[binding energies]] for transition states.  Since nearly all known chemistry requires a solvent, Smalley felt that Drexler's proposal to use a high vacuum environment was not feasible.  However, Drexler addresses this in Nanosystems by showing mathematically that well designed [[catalysts]] can provide the effects of a solvent and can fundamentally be made even more efficient than a solvent/[[enzyme]] reaction could ever be. It is noteworthy that, contrary to Smalley's opinion that enzymes require water, "Not only do enzymes work vigorously in anhydrous organic media, but in this unnatural milieu they acquire remarkable properties such as greatly enhanced stability, radically altered substrate and [[enantiomeric]] specificities, molecular memory, and the ability to catalyse unusual reactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Enzymatic catalysis in anhydrous organic solvents.|date=April 1989 | pmid=2658221 | doi=10.1016/0968-0004(89)90146-1|volume=14|journal=Trends Biochem Sci|pages=141–4 | last1 = Klibanov | first1 = AM}}"{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC397741/pdf/pnas00350-0138.pdf|title=Enzymatic catalysis in anhydrous organic solvents|date=April 1989 | pmc=397741|pmid=3858815|volume=82|journal=Proc.

===Redefining of the word "nanotechnology"===
For the future, some means have to be found for MNT design evolution at the nanoscale which mimics the process of biological evolution at the molecular scale. Biological evolution proceeds by random variation in ensemble averages of organisms combined with culling of the less-successful variants and reproduction of the more-successful variants, and macroscale engineering design also proceeds by a process of design evolution from simplicity to complexity as set forth somewhat satirically by [[John Gall (author)|John Gall]]: "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.  . . . A complex system designed from scratch never works and can not be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a system that works." &lt;ref name="JohGall"&gt;
Gall, John, (1986) Systemantics: How Systems Really Work and How They Fail, 2nd ed. Ann Arbor, MI : The General Systemantics Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A breakthrough in MNT is needed which proceeds from the simple atomic ensembles which can be built with, e.g., an STM to complex MNT systems via a process of design evolution. A handicap in this process is the difficulty of seeing and manipulation at the nanoscale compared to the macroscale which makes deterministic selection of successful trials difficult; in contrast biological evolution proceeds via action of what Richard Dawkins has called the "blind watchmaker"
&lt;ref name = "Dawkins"&gt;
Richard Dawkins, The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design, W. W. Norton; Reissue edition (September 19, 1996)
&lt;/ref&gt; 
comprising random molecular variation and deterministic reproduction/extinction.

At present in 2007 the practice of nanotechnology embraces both stochastic approaches (in which, for example, [[supramolecular chemistry]] creates waterproof pants) and deterministic approaches wherein single molecules (created by stochastic chemistry) are manipulated on substrate surfaces (created by stochastic deposition methods) by deterministic methods comprising nudging them with [[scanning tunneling microscope|STM]] or [[Atomic force microscope|AFM]] probes and causing simple binding or cleavage reactions to occur. The dream of a complex, deterministic molecular nanotechnology remains elusive.  Since the mid-1990s, thousands of surface scientists and thin film technocrats have latched on to the nanotechnology bandwagon and redefined their disciplines as nanotechnology.  This has caused much confusion in the field and has spawned thousands of "nano"-papers on the peer reviewed literature.  Most of these reports are extensions of the more ordinary research done in the parent fields.

===The feasibility of the proposals in ''Nanosystems''===
{{Multiple image

|footer = Top, a molecular propellor. Bottom, a molecular [[planetary gear]] system. The feasibility of devices like these has been questioned.}}

The feasibility of Drexler's proposals largely depends, therefore, on whether designs like those in ''Nanosystems'' could be built in the absence of a universal assembler to build them and would work as described. Supporters of molecular nanotechnology frequently claim that no significant errors have been discovered in ''Nanosystems'' since 1992. Even some critics concede&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softmachines.org/wordpress/index.php?p=50#comment-523 |title=Blog Archive » Is mechanosynthesis feasible? The debate moves up a gear |publisher=Soft Machines |date=2004-12-16 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "Drexler has carefully considered a number of physical principles underlying the 'high level' aspects of the nanosystems he proposes and, indeed, has thought in some detail" about some issues.

Other critics claim, however, that ''Nanosystems'' omits important chemical details about the low-level 'machine language' of molecular nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/drexler.html |title=Smalley |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanotech-now.com/Atkinson-Phoenix-Nanotech-Debate.htm |title=Atkinson |publisher=Nanotech-now.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softmachines.org/wordpress/index.php?p=70 |title=Moriarty |publisher=Softmachines.org |date=2005-01-26 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softmachines.org/wordpress/?p=175 |title=Jones |publisher=Softmachines.org |date=2005-12-18 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also claim that much of the other low-level chemistry in ''Nanosystems'' requires extensive further work, and that Drexler's higher-level designs therefore rest on speculative foundations.  Recent such further work by Freitas and Merkle &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/Publications.htm |title=Nanofactory Collaboration Publications |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is aimed at strengthening these foundations by filling the existing gaps in the low-level chemistry.

Drexler argues that we may need to wait until our conventional [[nanotechnology]] improves before solving these issues: "Molecular manufacturing will result from a series of advances in molecular machine systems, much as the first Moon landing resulted from a series of advances in liquid-fuel [[rocket]] systems. We are now in a position like that of the [[British Interplanetary Society]] of the 1930s which described how multistage liquid-fueled rockets could reach the Moon and pointed to early rockets as illustrations of the basic principle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softmachines.org/PDFs/Moriarty_Phoenix_1.pdf |title=Moriarity Correspondence |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Freitas and Merkle argue &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/index.htm#NeedFund |title=Nanofactory Collaboration |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a focused effort to achieve diamond mechanosynthesis (DMS) can begin now, using existing technology, and might achieve success in less than a decade if their "direct-to-DMS approach is pursued rather than a more circuitous development approach that seeks to implement less efficacious nondiamondoid molecular manufacturing technologies before progressing to diamondoid".

To summarize the arguments against feasibility:  First, critics argue that a primary barrier to achieving molecular nanotechnology is the lack of an efficient way to create machines on a molecular/atomic scale, especially in the absence of a well-defined path toward a self-replicating assembler or diamondoid nanofactory. Advocates respond that a preliminary research path leading to a diamondoid nanofactory is being developed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

A second difficulty in reaching molecular nanotechnology is design.  Hand design of a gear or bearing at the level of atoms might take a few to several weeks. While Drexler, Merkle and others have created designs of simple parts, no comprehensive design effort for anything approaching the complexity of a Model T Ford has been attempted.  Advocates respond that it is difficult to undertake a comprehensive design effort in the absence of significant funding for such efforts, and that despite this handicap much useful design-ahead has nevertheless been accomplished with new software tools that have been developed, e.g., at Nanorex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nanoengineer-1.com/content/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=40&amp;Itemid=50 |title=Nanorex, Inc. - Molecular Machinery Gallery |publisher=Nanoengineer-1.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latest report ''A Matter of Size: Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative''&lt;ref name="nanotechnology1"/&gt; put out by the National Academies Press in December 2006 (roughly twenty years after Engines of Creation was published), no clear way forward toward molecular nanotechnology could yet be seen, as per the conclusion on page 108 of that report: "Although theoretical calculations can be made today, the eventually attainable
range of chemical reaction cycles, error rates, speed of operation, and thermodynamic
efficiencies of such bottom-up manufacturing systems cannot be reliably
predicted at this time. Thus, the eventually attainable perfection and complexity of
manufactured products, while they can be calculated in theory, cannot be predicted
with confidence. Finally, the optimum research paths that might lead to systems
which greatly exceed the thermodynamic efficiencies and other capabilities of
biological systems cannot be reliably predicted at this time. Research funding that
is based on the ability of investigators to produce experimental demonstrations
that link to abstract models and guide long-term vision is most appropriate to
achieve this goal." This call for research leading to demonstrations is welcomed by groups such as the Nanofactory Collaboration who are specifically seeking experimental successes in diamond mechanosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/DMS.htm |title=Diamond Mechanosynthesis |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Technology Roadmap for [[Productive nanosystems|Productive Nanosystems]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/roadmaps |title=Technology Roadmap for Productive Nanosystems |publisher=Foresight.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims to offer additional constructive insights.

It is perhaps interesting to ask whether or not most structures consistent with physical law can in fact be manufactured.  Advocates assert that to achieve most of the vision of molecular manufacturing it is not necessary to be able to build "any structure that is compatible with natural law." Rather, it is necessary to be able to build only a sufficient (possibly modest) subset of such structures—as is true, in fact, of any practical manufacturing process used in the world today, and is true even in biology. In any event, as [[Richard Feynman]] once said, "It is scientific only to say what's more likely or less likely, and not to be proving all the time what's possible or impossible."&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikiquote:Richard Feynman]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existing work on diamond mechanosynthesis===

There is a growing body of peer-reviewed theoretical work on synthesizing diamond by mechanically removing/adding hydrogen atoms &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Papers/TemelsoHAbst.pdf High-level Ab Initio Studies of Hydrogen Abstraction from Prototype Hydrocarbon Systems].

Freitas, Allis and Merkle. ''J. Comput. Theor. Nanosci.'' Vol. 4, 2007, in press.&lt;/ref&gt; (a process known as [[mechanosynthesis]]). This work is slowly permeating the broader nanoscience community and is being critiqued.  For instance, Peng et al. (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Papers/JCTNPengFeb06.pdf |title=03CTN01-003 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in the continuing research effort by Freitas, Merkle and their collaborators) reports that the most-studied mechanosynthesis tooltip motif (DCB6Ge) successfully places a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; carbon [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] on a C(110) [[diamond]] surface at both 300&amp;nbsp;K (room temperature) and 80&amp;nbsp;K ([[liquid nitrogen]] temperature), and that the silicon variant (DCB6Si) also works at 80&amp;nbsp;K but not at 300&amp;nbsp;K. Over 100,000 CPU hours were invested in this latest study.  The DCB6 tooltip motif, initially described by Merkle and Freitas at a Foresight Conference in 2002, was the first complete tooltip ever proposed for diamond mechanosynthesis and remains the only tooltip motif that has been successfully simulated for its intended function on a full 200-atom diamond surface.

The tooltips modeled in this work are intended to be used only in carefully controlled environments (e.&amp;nbsp;g., vacuum). Maximum acceptable limits for tooltip translational and rotational misplacement errors are reported in Peng et al. (2006) -- tooltips must be positioned with great accuracy to avoid bonding the dimer incorrectly.  Peng et al.

More importantly, the vibrational footprints of a DCB6Ge tooltip mounted on a 384-atom handle and of the same tooltip mounted on a similarly constrained but much larger 636-atom "crossbar" handle are virtually identical in the non-crossbar directions.

A working [[nanofactory]] would require a variety of well-designed tips for different reactions, and detailed analyses of placing atoms on more complicated surfaces. Although this appears a challenging problem given current resources, many tools will be available to help future researchers: [[Moore's law]] predicts further increases in computer power, [[Fabrication (semiconductor)|semiconductor fabrication]] techniques continue to approach the nanoscale, and researchers grow ever more skilled at using [[protein]]s, [[ribosome]]s and [[DNA]] to perform novel chemistry.

==Works of fiction==
*In ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' by [[Neal Stephenson]], diamond can be built directly out of carbon atoms. All sorts of devices from dust-size detection devices to giant diamond zeppelins are constructed atom by atom using only carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and chlorine atoms.
*In the novel ''Tomorrow'' by Andrew Saltzman ({{ISBN|1-4243-1027-X}}), a scientist uses [[nanorobotics]] to create a liquid that when inserted into the [[bloodstream]], renders one nearly [[wikt:invincible|invincible]] given that the microscopic machines repair tissue almost instantaneously after it is damaged.
*In the [[roleplaying game]] ''[[Splicers]]'' by [[Palladium Books]], humanity has succumbed to a "nanobot plague" that causes any object made of a non-[[precious metal]] to twist and change shape (sometimes into a type of [[robot]]) moments after being touched by a human.  The object will then proceed to attack the human.  This has forced humanity to develop "biotechnological" devices to replace those previously made of metal.
* On the television show ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', the [[Nanites]] (voiced variously by [[Kevin Murphy (actor)|Kevin Murphy]], [[Paul Chaplin (actor)|Paul Chaplin]], [[Mary Jo Pehl]], and [[Bridget Jones (actor)|Bridget Jones]]) – are self-replicating, bio-engineered organisms that work on the ship, they are microscopic creatures that reside in the Satellite of Love's computer systems. (They are similar to the creatures in ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Evolution (TNG episode)|Evolution]]", which featured "nanites" taking over the ''Enterprise''.) The Nanites made their first appearance in season 8. Based on the concept of [[nanotechnology]], their comical ''[[deus ex machina]]'' activities included such diverse tasks as instant repair and construction, hairstyling, performing a Nanite variation of a [[flea circus]], conducting a microscopic war, and even destroying the Observers' planet after a dangerously vague request from Mike to "take care of [a] little problem". They also ran a [[microbrewery]].
* In the novel "Prey" by Michael Crichton, self replicating nanobots create autonomous nano-swarms with predatory behaviors. The protagonist must stop the swarm before it evolves into a grey goo plague.

Maybury was kidnapped, [[rape]]d, and murdered on 6 November 1984,&lt;ref name=fresh&gt;{{cite news |first=Keith |last=Moor | authorlink = Keith Moor|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/sixyearold-kylie-mayburys-1984-melbourne-cup-day-kidnap-and-rape-and-murder-faces-fresh-investigation-by-victoria-police/story-fni0ffnk-1227113797961?nk=e81654b585dbbae1a39713a6c74263cd |title=Six-year-old Kylie Maybury’s 1984 Melbourne Cup Day kidnap, and rape and murder, faces fresh investigation by Victoria Police |newspaper=[[Herald Sun]] |date=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the date of the 1984 [[Melbourne Cup#Public holiday|Melbourne Cup Day]]; and she was nicknamed in the Melbourne tabloid newspaper ''[[The Sun News-Pictorial]]'' as the '''''Cup Day Girl'''''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sun News-Pictorial'', 8 November 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 30 years after her death, in June 2016 [[Victoria Police]] arrested and charged Gregory Keith Davies with the abduction, rape, and murder of Maybury. Davies later pleaded guilty to the murder and rape of Maybury and in December 2017 he was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] with a non-[[parole]] period of 28 years.

==Abduction and murder==
&lt;mapframe text="Modern-day map of Preston, Victoria" width=250 height=250 zoom=17 latitude=-37.73802 longitude=145.01212/&gt;
Maybury lived with her younger sister and their mother in Gregory Grove.&lt;ref name=fresh/&gt;

On the afternoon of 6 November 1984, Maybury had been sent to a [[convenience store]] on Plenty Road to buy a bag of sugar, which she bought at around 5:30 pm. She was last seen going home, carrying a bag of sugar, and looking as if she were lost.&lt;ref name="fresh"/&gt;&lt;ref name=canberra&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article122527072 |title=Body of girl, 6, found in gutter. |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times|The Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 – 1995)]] |location=ACT |date=8 November 1984 |accessdate=28 December 2014 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother and neighbour went looking for her at around 6:00 pm,&lt;ref name="fresh"/&gt; when a woman approached them saying that she'd seen a girl being driven away in a white Holden station wagon.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silvester|first1=John|title=Kylie Maybury's killer trapped by mix of new-age science, old-fashioned policing|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/kylie-mayburys-killer-trapped-by-mix-of-newage-science-oldfashioned-policing-20170529-gwfe06.html|accessdate=21 December 2017|work=The Age|date=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maybury's body was found in the gutter of Donald Street at about 00:45 that night by a fire brigade electrician, Neil Rickwood, but had not been there when police searched Donald Street at 7:30 pm.&lt;ref name="fresh"/&gt;

She had died of [[asphyxia]]tion while being raped and had suffered severe internal injuries, including [[vaginal trauma]]. The [[autopsy]] found that [[diazepam]], a strong sedative, was in her body, suggesting that she had been drugged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rosemary |last=Mullaly |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&amp;dat=19860123&amp;id=kcwzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=U5UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6758,4146460 |title=Murdered girl might have been drugged, coroner finds |newspaper=[[The Age]] |date=23 January 1986 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Maybury's murder received significant media coverage. 

Maybury was interred at [[Fawkner Crematorium and Memorial Park]]. Her uncle, Mark Maybury, was a suspect in the case; he committed suicide in 1987. He was later found to be innocent of the crime, and is buried in the same cemetery as Maybury.&lt;ref name="fawkner"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fresh/&gt; Her grandfather, John Moss, was similarly a suspect, committing suicide in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silvester|first1=John|title=Kylie Maybury, 6, was murdered on a family errand: 32 years later police swoop|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/kylie-maybury-6-was-murdered-on-a-family-errand-32-years-later-police-swoop-20160609-gpfny0.html|accessdate=1 December 2017|work=The Age|date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, Victorian Police focused their attention on Robert Arthur Selby Lowe, who had murdered Melbourne schoolgirl [[Murder of Sheree Beasley|Sheree Beasley]].&lt;ref name=fresh/&gt; Shortly before Maybury's murder, Lowe had been interviewed by police about offensive behaviour to young girls near Preston.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  [[DNA profiling]] later proved that Lowe was not responsible for Maybury's murder.&lt;ref name=fresh/&gt; Victoria Police began a new investigation into the murder among other cold cases in 2014, after media interest in the case led to numerous suspects being reported to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moor|first1=Keith|title=Fresh probes into 63 cold case murders|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/cold-case-files-victoria-police-secretly-starts-fresh-investigations-into-63-unsolved-murders/news-story/45ab429f8a2222e67fa31c31dc7e6dbe?nk=402e4020e57038fb7086c1198f56ec97-1512095837|accessdate=1 December 2017|work=The Herald Sun|date=7 December 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charges, committal and sentencing===
In June 2016, a 73-year-old man, Gregory Keith Davies, was charged with the false imprisonment, rape and murder of Maybury, with a [[committal hearing]] for the case scheduled for May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-09/kylie-maybury-case-man-arrested-over-1984-abduction-murder/7496190 |title=Kylie Maybury death: Gregory Keith Davies charged with murder, rape of Preston girl in 1984 |publisher=ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |date=9 June 2016 |accessdate=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-29/mother-of-murdered-girl-to-be-questioned-about-valium-court/7888376 |title=Kylie Maybury's mother to be quizzed about 'murdered' girl's access to Valium |publisher=ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |date=29 September 2016 |accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Davies was interviewed by police two days after the murder during the original investigation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 1970, he had bludgeoned a teenage girl with a hammer and told police he intended to rape her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bucci, Nino|title=Kylie's Killer Attacked 14 Years Earlier|work=The Age|location=Melbourne|date=31 May 2017|page=1 |via=[[EBSCOhost]] |url=http://www.search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=anh&amp;AN=DOC6V5KCOHYC3A1KCR6MNJM&amp;site=ehost-live |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of the attack on Maybury, Davies lived in the area with his mother,&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kylie Maybury's killer 'a marked man' as family describes anguish after 6yo's death|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-27/kylie-mayburys-killer-gregory-keith-davies-a-marked-man/9197284|accessdate=1 December 2017|work=ABC News|date=27 November 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; and drove a white Holden,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; but was removed from the investigation without giving a DNA sample because he gave an alibi.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; 

On 29 May 2017, Davies pleaded guilty to one charge of murder and one of rape, with the false imprisonment charge being taken into consideration.&lt;ref name="plea"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooper|first1=Adam|title=Gregory Davies pleads guilty to murder of six-year-old Kylie Maybury 30 years ago|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/man-pleads-guilty-to-murder-of-kylie-maybury-30-years-ago-20170529-gwf7zp|accessdate=29 May 2017|work=The Age|date=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Davies was remanded into custody until a plea hearing on 21 September.

===Other legal matters involving Davies===
Earlier in his life Davies was convicted of another sex crime;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and, according to a relative, Davies spent years jailed for other sex crimes against children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Moor, Keith |title=Kylie’s Murderer Molested Others, Relative Says |work=Herald Sun |location=Melbourne |date=1 June 2017 |page=2 |via=[[EBSCOhost]] |url=http://www.search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=anh&amp;AN=9X9DHSNEWSMMGLSTRY000276439779&amp;site=ehost-live |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the publicity of Maybury's rape and murder, several children told their parents that Davies had sexually assaulted them, but the charges against Davies were dropped as prosecutors suggested that it would be too hard for the children to testify in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Moor, Keith |title=Killer’s Sick Abuse in Van |work=Herald Sun |location=Melbourne |date=21 December 2017 |page=10 |via=[[EBSCOhost]] |url=http://www.search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=anh&amp;AN=9X9DHSNEWSMMGLSTRY000355171852&amp;site=ehost-live |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasry J revealed in the sentencing proceedings that in May 1968 Davies was placed on a three-year good [[Fidelity bond|behaviour bond]] for [[larceny]], [[fraud]], and uttering. In February 1971 he was tried in the Victorian Supreme Court on the charge of attempted murder and wounding with intent to cause [[grievous bodily harm]], the victim being a 14-year-old girl. Davies was acquitted on the basis on [[insanity]], yet ordered to be detained [[At Her Majesty's pleasure|at the Governor's pleasure]] and was released from custody on 3 November 1982. During this ten-year period in custody, Davies did not undergo any psychiatric treatment. In 1993 Davies was convicted on a number of [[burglar]]y, theft, and dishonesty charges; in 1996 he was convicted of charges involving [[indecent assault]] and gross indecency charges for which he served time in custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=The Queen v Gregory Keith Davies|court=VSC|year=2017|num=800|pinpoint=10:15|courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neil R. MacCallum''' (15 May 1954 &amp;ndash; 9 November 2002) was a [[Scottish nationalist]] political activist and poet.

Born in [[Edinburgh]], MacCallum studied at Firrhill High School and [[Napier College]] before working for the [[Lothian Health Board]].&lt;ref name="scotsman" /&gt;  In this role, he joined the [[NALGO]] trade union and served for a while as a [[shop steward]].&lt;ref&gt;Linda Anderson, Bob Bright and Jon Kimber, ''General Election Guide 1983'', p.225 (BBC Data)&lt;/ref&gt;  He joined the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) while young, and attended the 1972 [[Plaid Cymru]] conference with a group of friends from the SNP, drawing attention by playing the [[bagpipes]] at the event.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;Peter D. Wright, "[http://scotsindependent.scot/oldsitearchive/scotind/features/maccallum_neil.htm Neil R MacCallum]", ''[[Scots Independent]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

MacCallum was elected to [[Edinburgh City Council]] in 1977, representing Wester Hailes.  He lost his seat in 1980, but was elected as Assistant National Secretary of the SNP, then National Secretary the following year.&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;"[http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/neil-maccallum-1-629520 Neil MacCallum]", ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 21 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  While Secretary, he chaired the SNP Commission of Inquiry into the party's structures, and it was he who convinced party leader [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] to include [[Alex Salmond]] as a member.&lt;ref&gt;David Torrance, ''Salmond: Against The Odds''&lt;/ref&gt;  He also stood as a candidate in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]] in [[Edinburgh South (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh South]], taking fourth place with 5.0% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/ge83/i08.htm  UK General Election results June 1983]", ''Richard Kimber's Political Science Resources''&lt;/ref&gt;  He stood down in 1986, following ill health, and was succeeded by his assistant, [[John Swinney]].&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;

MacCallum also wrote poetry in [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]], his work first appearing in "Out of Charity" in 1973, and from the late 1980s, he published compilations of other poetry in the language.  In the 1990s, he became active in the [[Scots Language Society]] and served on the board of the [[Scottish Poetry Library]], and acted as arts correspondent for the ''[[Scots Independent]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref name="scotsman" /&gt;

In later life, MacCallum suffered with depression and problematic drinking, and went missing on several occasions.  In November 2002, he fell into the [[Union Canal (Scotland)|Union Canal]] and died later the same day from [[hypothermia]].&lt;ref name="scotsman" /&gt;

The pool was alleged to have been in operation from [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|2009]] (the year in which the Saints won [[Super Bowl XLIV]]) to [[2011 New Orleans Saints season|2011]].

League commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] responded with some of the most severe sanctions in the league's 92-year history, and among the most severe punishments for in-game misconduct in North American professional sports history. Defensive coordinator [[Gregg Williams]] was suspended indefinitely, though this would be overturned the following year. Head coach [[Sean Payton]] was suspended for the entire [[2012 NFL season|2012 season]]—the first time since [[Chuck Fairbanks]] in 1978 that a head coach had been suspended. General manager [[Mickey Loomis]] was suspended for the first eight games of the 2012 season. Assistant head coach [[Joe Vitt]] was suspended for the first six games of the 2012 season. The Saints organization was penalized with a $500,000 fine and forced to forfeit their second-round draft selections in [[2012 NFL Draft|2012]] and [[2013 NFL Draft|2013]]. In May 2012, four current and former Saints players were suspended after being named as ringleaders in the scandal, with linebacker [[Jonathan Vilma]] also being suspended for the entire 2012 season.&lt;ref name="ESPNplayers"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7881761/nfl-bans-four-players-new-orleans-saints-bounty-roles|title=Jonathan Vilma banned one year|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, former commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] overturned all sanctions against the players in December 2012 after finding that despite the players being "very much involved", the coaches and the Saints organization were primarily responsible for the scandal.&lt;ref name=Tagliabuevacate/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Gregg Williams at Tulane Commencement 2010.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Saints defensive coordinator [[Gregg Williams]]]]
The NFL has long frowned upon bounties, or "non-contract bonuses" as it officially calls them;  but an underground culture of bounties is alleged to exist, with teams, it is claimed,  [[turning a blind eye]] to the practice.  The league constitution specifically forbids payment of bonuses based on performances against an individual player or team, as well as bonuses for on-field misconduct; the NFL holds that such practices undermine the integrity of the game, and also would allow teams to use such payments to circumvent the [[salary cap]]. The [[collective bargaining agreement]] with the [[NFL Players Association]] also forbids this practice, as does the standard NFL player contract.&lt;ref name=NFLStatement/&gt; Every year, the NFL sends a memo reiterating this ban to every team before training camp opens. However, according to many former players, bounty systems of some sort have been around the NFL for decades, with the percentage of players participating non-scientifically estimated to be between 30 and 40 percent.&lt;ref name=Freeman2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/17595418/saints-took-common-practice-of-a-bounty-system-to-new-dangerous-level|title=Saints took common practice of bounties to new, dangerous level|last=Freeman|first=Mike|publisher=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=2012-03-05|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020180352/http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/17595418/saints-took-common-practice-of-a-bounty-system-to-new-dangerous-level|archivedate=2012-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   According to these players, such bounty programs were usually informal and often between players only, more with intent at locker-room braggadocio than systemic malice.  What would draw attention to the Saints' bounty program was the alleged practice of methodically organizing such a concept at the coaches' level, with the primary intent to systematically and routinely injure opposing star players.

After the Saints defeated the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in the [[2009–10 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: New Orleans Saints 31, Minnesota Vikings 28 (OT)|NFC Championship Game]], several Vikings players and coaches claimed that the Saints were deliberately trying to hurt Vikings quarterback [[Brett Favre]]. The Vikings were particularly angered when Saints defensive end [[Bobby McCray]] and defensive tackle [[Remi Ayodele]] knocked Favre to the ground with a high-low hit. McCray hit Favre below the knees, briefly knocking Favre out of the game with an ankle injury. No penalty was called on the play, though NFL vice president of officiating [[Mike Pereira]] said one should have been called, saying it was "the type of hit we don't want." Vikings coach [[Brad Childress]] later said that there were at least 13 instances where he felt the Saints deliberately went after Favre. Later, [[CBSSports.com]] NFL columnist Clark Judge said several Vikings assistants told him they believed McCray was acting on direct orders from Williams, with at least one being so outraged that he threatened to "punch [Williams] in the face" the next time they met.&lt;ref name=ClarkJudge&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/17546706/saints-team-officials-involved-in-bounty-program-should-pay-dearly|title=Saints, team officials involved in bounty program should pay dearly|last=Judge|first=Clark|publisher=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vikings owner [[Zygi Wilf]] even went as far as to complain to the league about what happened to Favre, though no action was taken at the time.&lt;ref name=Seifert&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/39041/saints-shots-at-brett-favre-were-no-secret|title=Saints' shots at Favre were no secret|last=Seifert|first=Kevin|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Favre took such a severe beating that Vikings punter [[Chris Kluwe]] and placekicker [[Ryan Longwell]] wondered during the game if someone had put a bounty on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/39907/chris-kluwe-ban-jonathan-vilma-for-life|title=Chris Kluwe: Ban Jonathan Vilma for life|last=Seifert|first=Kevin|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Favre's agent, Bus Cook, later said that he also felt the Saints were deliberately trying to knock Favre out of the game, and claimed that several hits on [[Arizona Cardinals]] quarterback [[Kurt Warner]] in the divisional round a week earlier crossed the line as well.&lt;ref name=ESPNBounty&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7638603/new-orleans-saints-defense-had-bounty-program-nfl-says|title=NFL: Saints defense had 'bounty' fund|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It initially appeared that Cook's argument was strengthened by the fact that Warner was knocked out of that game with a chest injury (although he later returned), and retired two weeks later. However, Warner later said that the hit which knocked him out was legal, and had nothing to do with his decision to retire.&lt;ref name=Warner&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcwest/post/_/id/59989/warner-saints-hit-legal-not-career-ending|title=Warner: Saints hit legal, not career-ending|last=Bando|first=Sal|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==

[[File:Roger Goodell at Super Bowl 43.jpg|thumb|right|100px|NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]]]]
In the 2010 offseason, an anonymous player told NFL officials that the Saints had targeted Favre and Warner as part of a bounty program administered by Williams; the NFL's security department found the allegations credible enough to open an investigation. However, the players and team officials interviewed all denied that any bounty program existed, and the player who made the initial report subsequently recanted his allegations.&lt;ref name=NFLStatement/&gt;&lt;ref name=King&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/peter_king/03/02/saints.bounties/index.html|title=Saints looking at severe punishment for bounty system|last=King|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter King (sportswriter)|publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFL began investigating the Saints in 2010 in response to allegations of deliberate attempts to injure players during the [[2009–10 NFL playoffs|2009–10 playoffs]], but the investigation stalled until late in the 2011 season. On March 2, 2012, the NFL announced that it had evidence that [[defensive coordinator]] [[Gregg Williams]] had created the program soon after his arrival in 2009, and alleged that "between 22 and 27 Saints players" were involved.&lt;ref name=NFLStatement&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2012/03/full_nfl_statement_into_bounty.html|title=Full NFL statement on bounty investigation|author=[[National Football League]]|date=2012-03-02|accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams and the players pooled their own money to pay out performance bonuses. It also asserted that head coach [[Sean Payton]] tried to cover up the scheme, and that he and general manager [[Mickey Loomis]] failed to shut it down when ordered to do so by team owner [[Tom Benson]]. Since then, Williams has been accused of operating similar schemes during his tenure as defensive coordinator of the [[Tennessee Titans|Tennessee Oilers/Titans]] and [[Washington Redskins]] and as head coach of the [[Buffalo Bills]]; the NFL briefly investigated these allegations but elected to focus on the Saints.

==Whistleblower==

In 2012, ESPN reported that former New Orleans Saints defensive assistant Mike Cerullo contacted the NFL regarding a bounty program after the 2009 postseason. &lt;ref name=Barr1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/8744952/mike-cerullo-former-new-orleans-saints-assistant-sends-letter-former-nfl-commissioner-paul-tagliabue|title=Mike Cerullo: I've been 'vilified'|last=Barr|first=John|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cerullo was released after the 2009 postseason for poor performance and lying about personal leave according to the New Orleans Saints.&lt;ref name=Katzenstein1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2017/12/sean_payton_mike_cerullo.html|title=Sean Payton: NFL hiring of bounty whistleblower Mike Cerullo 'unbelievable'|last=Katzenstein|first=Josh|publisher=[[NOLA.com]]|date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cerullo testified that he kept track of payments and pledges made. Cerullo also states in the article, "I was angry for being let go from the Saints". In the summer of 2017, the NFL hired Mike Cerullo as Director of Football Administration. &lt;ref name=Katzenstein2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2017/12/sean_payton_mike_cerullo.html|title=Sean Payton: NFL hiring of bounty whistleblower Mike Cerullo 'unbelievable'|last=Katzenstein|first=Josh|publisher=[[NOLA.com]]|date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Findings revealed==
Late in the 2011 season, the NFL received what it called "significant and credible new information" that suggested there was indeed a "bounty" program in place.&lt;ref name=NFLStatement/&gt; League officials, convinced that this information was irrefutable evidence a program was indeed in place, alerted Benson of their findings just before the Saints' first-round playoff game against the [[Detroit Lions]].&lt;ref name=KingOutofBounds&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/1009529/62/2|title=Way out of Bounds|last=King|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter King (sportswriter)|publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation continued during the [[2011–12 NFL playoffs|2011–12 playoffs]] and continued through the 2012 offseason.

On March 2, 2012, [[ESPN]]'s [[Adam Schefter]] reported that the NFL had indeed found evidence of a bounty program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:7638694|title=Saints D Kept Bounty Fund|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, the NFL announced it had obtained irrefutable proof of a bounty pool dating back to the 2009 season, based on a review of 18,000 documents. It determined that Williams had initiated the fund soon after he arrived in New Orleans in 2009, in hopes of making the defense more aggressive. Between 22 and 27 Saints defensive players were involved. The players and Williams contributed their own cash to the pot, and received cash payments based on their performance in the previous week's game. For instance, a [[special teams|special teamer]] who downed a kick returner inside the receiving team's 20-yard-line earned $100. Players could also be fined for mental mistakes and penalties. Players also received "bounties" for "cart-offs" (plays in which an opponent was removed from the field on a stretcher or cart) and "knockouts" (plays that resulted in a player being unable to return for the rest of the game). Players usually earned $1,000 for "cart-offs" and $1,500 for "knockouts" during the regular season, though they were encouraged to put their winnings back into the pot in order to raise the stakes as the season went on. Payments were known to double or even triple during the playoffs.&lt;ref name=NFLStatement/&gt;&lt;ref name=KingOutofBounds/&gt;&lt;ref name=NFLPenalties&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d827c15b2/article/nfl-announces-management-discipline-in-saints-bounty-matter|title=NFL announces management discipline in Saints' 'bounty' matter|work=NFL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFL sent a confidential and detailed memo to all 32 teams detailing its findings. It revealed that the Saints had not only targeted Warner and Favre during the 2009 playoffs, but had also targeted [[Green Bay Packers]] quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] and [[Carolina Panthers]] quarterback [[Cam Newton]] during the 2011 regular season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcsouth/post/_/id/32684/nfl-saints-targeted-cam-newton|title=NFL: Saints targeted Cam Newton|last=Yasinskas|first=Pat|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to that memo, Saints linebacker [[Jonathan Vilma]] offered $10,000 cash to any teammate who knocked Favre out of the NFC Championship Game.&lt;ref name=King/&gt; Another source told CBSSports.com's Mike Freeman that [[Reggie Bush]]'s agent at the time, Michael Ornstein, was closely involved in the scheme from the beginning. Ornstein contributed $10,000 to the pot in 2009, and an undisclosed amount in 2011.&lt;ref name=Freeman1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mike-freeman.blogs.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/6264363/35066335|title=NFL memo details more Saints bounty accusations|last=Freeman|first=Mike|publisher=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=2012-03-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306043855/http://mike-freeman.blogs.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/6264363/35066335|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After later investigations in the 2012 offseason, the NFL also found evidence that the Saints put a bounty on then-[[Seattle Seahawks]] quarterback, [[Matt Hasselbeck]] during their 2011 wild-card playoffs game.

The league found that Payton not only knew about the scheme, but tried to cover it up during both league investigations. During the 2010 investigation, Payton told Williams and Vitt to "make sure our ducks are in a row" when the league interviewed them. Before the start of the 2011 season, Payton received an email from Ornstein detailing the broader lines of the scheme. In that same email, Ornstein offered $5,000 to anyone who knocked Rodgers out of the 2011 season opener. Payton initially denied knowing that this email existed, but subsequently admitted that in fact he had read it.&lt;ref name=KingOutofBounds/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freeman1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2012/03/mike_ornsteins_association_wit.html|title=Mike Ornstein's association with New Orleans Saints and bounty scandal a perplexing situation|last=Duncan|first=Jeff|publisher=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPNPenaltyAnnouncement&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7718136/sean-payton-new-orleans-saints-banned-one-year-bounties|title=NFL hammers Saints for bounties|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Benson was informed of the league's findings, he called in Payton and Loomis and ordered the program shut down immediately. However, they did not do so. Loomis had been interviewed during the 2010 investigation as well, and had stated that he knew of no such scheme and would stop it immediately if it was taking place. The league also found that Vitt, whom Payton had assigned to monitor Williams (the two reportedly didn't get along very well), also knew about the broader lines of the scheme and even witnessed Williams handing out payments to players. However, Vitt failed to tell anyone about it.&lt;ref name=NFLStatement/&gt;&lt;ref name=NFLPenalties/&gt;

The NFL found that Payton and Loomis' [[misfeasance]] amounted to "conduct detrimental" to the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82757bcd/article/nfl-says-saints-created-bounty-program-from-20092011|title=NFL says Saints created 'bounty' program from 2009–2011|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFL found no club money had been used to fund the bounty pool, and praised Benson for doing what he could to shut down the slush fund. Nonetheless, it found the Saints organization as a whole guilty of conduct detrimental to the league as well due to Williams and the players' maintenance of the bounty pool, as well as Loomis and Payton's failure to act "in a responsible manner" to stop it.&lt;ref name=NFLPenalties/&gt;&lt;ref name=KingMarch5&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/peter_king/03/05/offseason/index.html|title=As bounty fallout continues, Goodell to make example of Saints|last=King|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter King (sportswriter)|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[Chicago Bears]] players and fans believe that the Bears were targets of this program during the second game of the 2011 season, a 30–13 loss to the Saints. Quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] was sacked six times, and nearly lost his voice when a Saints player kicked him in the throat. Later in the game, offensive tackle [[Frank Omiyale]] yanked a Saints defender off Cutler when he saw what he later called "some dirty stuff."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright |first=Michael C. |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/bears/post/_/id/4675326/bears-wonder-if-saints-targeted-them |title=Bears wonder if Saints targeted them |publisher=[[ESPN|ESPN Chicago]] |date= |accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] quarterback [[Josh Freeman]] reported that the Saints' tendency toward illegal hits was common knowledge among the Tampa Bay coaching staff. Preparations for Saints games included warnings to offensive players to keep their knees protected, especially on plays near the sidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Stroud, Rick.

In June 2012, the league revealed that it possessed a [[ledger]] detailing the weekly earnings of the players, which are earned for cart-offs ($1000) and "whacks" ($400) and deducted for "mental errors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Cole|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--sources--new-orleans-saints-kept-a--ledger--detailing-weekly-earnings-in-bounty-scandal.html|title=Sources: New Orleans Saints kept a 'ledger' detailing weekly earnings in bounty scandal|publisher=Sports.yahoo.com|date=2012-06-27|accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82982f9f/article/report-saints-ledger-shows-cartoffs-worth-1k?module=HP11_headline_stack|title=Report: Saints Ledger Shows Cart-offs Worth 1K|publisher=NFL.com|date=June 1, 2012|accessdate=2012-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on July 26, 2012, Vilma and seven witnesses from the Saints testified in front of a federal judge in New Orleans that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell got his facts wrong in the bounty scandal."Everybody was sworn in under oath in front of a judge with the risk of perjury and jail time if we were lying, and categorically denied there was a bounty," Vilma said in a text message to ESPN's [[Ed Werder]]. "Seven people testified, 2 sworn affidavits (one by Drew Brees) all saying the same thing. I ask that you and ESPN report the facts. No more bias or b.s. or hearsay. I gave you facts that you can report if so choose."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8202975/new-orleans-saints-linebacker-jonathan-vilma-testifies|title=New Orleans Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma testifies|work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tulane University Sports Law Program Director Gabe Feldman (who attended the hearing in court) said, "Clearly the judge, by her questions, indicated she thinks Goodell overstepped his authority, and this case was always going to be about if he executed his power fairly... The NFL's retort is that with all due deference, you don't get to second guess (commissioner Roger Goodell). Judges only have limited jurisdiction over arbitration issues."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2012/07/new_orleans_saints_linebacker_39.html|title=New Orleans Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma does not receive restraining order, still hopeful for favorable ruling|work=NOLA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saints All-Pro quarterback Drew Brees made a somewhat controversial tweet on June 20, 2012 stating, "If NFL fans were told there were "weapons of mass destruction" enough times, they'd believe it. But what happens when you don't find any????" Brees immediately issued another statement to clarify, "My WMD comment has nothing to do with politics or our brave military. Merely an analogy to show how media influences public perception." He went on to say, "I apologize if the WMD comment offended anyone. Especially our military. There is no one I respect more than our service men and women."&lt;ref name="klopman1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/20/drew-brees-wmd-tweet-apologizes-saints-bounty_n_1613163.html|work=Huffington Post|first=Michael|last=Klopman|title=NFL Star Apologizes For Controversial 'WMD' Tweet|date=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other allegations against Williams==
Shortly after the Saints' bounty system came to light, four former [[Washington Redskins]] players, as well as a coach, told ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that Williams operated a similar system while he was the Redskins' defensive coordinator from 2004 to 2007. The players said that Williams paid his crew thousands of dollars for aggressive play, with the biggest payouts—as much as $8,000—coming for "kill shots" that knocked opposing players out of games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins/washington-redskins-offered-bounties-for-big-hits-under-former-assistant-coach-gregg-williams/2012/03/02/gIQAH0RlnR_story.html|title=Washington Redskins offered bounties for big hits under former assistant coach Gregg Williams|last=Maske|first=Mark|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' NFL analyst [[Matt Bowen (American football)|Matt Bowen]], who played for the Redskins at the time, later wrote in one of his regular columns that the bounty pool was funded by fines for mistakes made during practice and in games, and insisted similar systems operated on other teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-0304-bowen-nfl--20120304,0,4015992.column|title=Bounties part of game across the NFL|last=Bowen|first=Matt|authorlink=Matt Bowen (American football)|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 4, ''The Post'' reported that the NFL was investigating the allegations against Williams with the Redskins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins/nfl-to-investigate-redskins-over-bounty-allegations/2012/03/03/gIQAwS9XpR_story.html|title=NFL to investigate Redskins over bounty allegations under Gregg Williams|last=Maske|first=Mark|work=The Washington Post|date=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several former Bills players subsequently told ''[[The Buffalo News]]'' of a similar system during Williams' tenure as Bills' head coach from 2001 to 2003. However, they didn't agree on whether there were rewards for intentionally injuring players. [[Coy Wire]], a safety during Williams' tenure, said that Williams gave bonuses for hits that left opponents seriously injured, and two other players said that bonuses were also awarded for "knockouts." However, linebacker [[Eddie Robinson (linebacker)|Eddie Robinson]], who played for Williams in Houston and Tennessee as well as in Buffalo, acknowledged an incentive pool but said he never heard Williams favor deliberately injuring other players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/bills-nfl/article747663.ece|title=Bills had bounty system under Gregg Williams, players say|last=Graham|first=Tim|publisher=[[The Buffalo News]]|date=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruben Brown]], a guard for the Bills during Williams's time as coach there, denied there was any sort of bounty system in place in Buffalo,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wgrz.com/news/article/158807/37/Ruben-Brown-says-Bills-Didnt-Run-Bounty-System Ruben Brown says Bills didn't run bounty system] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120918070810/http://www.wgrz.com/news/article/158807/37/Ruben-Brown-says-Bills-Didnt-Run-Bounty-System |date=2012-09-18 }}.

Former NFL coach [[Tony Dungy]] later told [[Profootballtalk.com]] he was certain that Williams operated a similar bounty system while he was defensive coordinator of the Oilers/Titans from 1997 to 2000. He also believes that Williams put a bounty on [[Indianapolis Colts]] quarterback [[Peyton Manning]] during Super Bowl XLIV, and targeted Manning on several occasions while with the Titans. The revelation of the bounty system also caused renewed speculation about a 2006 game between the Redskins and Colts, in which Manning was knocked down by a high-low hit from the Redskins' [[Phillip Daniels]] and [[Andre Carter]] and appeared to lose some feeling in his neck. While Dungy didn't speculate at the time about whether the Redskins targeted Manning on that play, he believes that hit ultimately caused the neck problems that sidelined Manning for the entire 2011 season and led to his departure for the [[Denver Broncos]] afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/03/02/dungy-titans-had-a-bounty-on-peyton-manning|title=Dungy: Titans had a bounty on Peyton Manning|last=Florio|first=Mike|publisher=[[Profootballtalk.com]]/[[NBC Sports]]|date=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former safety [[Ryan Clark (American football)|Ryan Clark]], who played under Williams in Washington from 2004–2005 and himself was fined by the NFL $40,000 for a helmet-to-helmet hit against [[Baltimore Ravens]] tight end [[Ed Dickson]] during the 2011 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7212307/ryan-clark-pittsburgh-steelers-fined-40k-takes-jab-roger-goodell|title=Ryan Clark of Pittsburgh Steelers fined $40K, takes jab at Roger Goodell|publisher=Espn.go.com|date=2011-11-10|accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; defended Williams, saying that he never ran a bounty program with the Redskins and has yet to see one during his time in the NFL.

==Aftermath==
Williams, who left after the season to become defensive coordinator of the [[St. Louis Rams]], was summoned to NFL headquarters after the investigation concluded in mid-February. He initially denied any involvement, but recanted and admitted everything in a meeting with Goodell.&lt;ref name=KingOutofBounds/&gt; After the story broke, Williams issued a statement calling his involvement "a terrible mistake." Williams said that he knew all along the slush fund broke the rules, and that "I should have stopped it" rather than get further involved.&lt;ref name=ESPNBounty/&gt; Goodell said in a statement that he found it "particularly disturbing" that the Saints were deliberately trying to injure other players. He said that players and coaches involved in the scheme could face fines or suspensions, and the Saints could be docked picks in the [[2012 NFL Draft]] and future drafts.&lt;ref name=NFLStatement/&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPNBounty/&gt;

Benson issued a statement on the Saints' Website saying, "I have been made aware of the NFL’s findings relative to the “Bounty Rule” and how it relates to our club. I have offered and the NFL has received our full cooperation in their investigation. While the findings may be troubling, we look forward to putting this behind us and winning more championships in the future for our fans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neworleanssaints.com/news-and-events/article-1/Statement-From-Saints-Owner-Tom-Benson/76e57e46-fa7a-4594-b522-ae05a60b8a4b |title=Statement From Saints Owner Tom Benson |publisher=[[New Orleans Saints]]|date=2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBSSports.com's Pat Kirwan [[Twitter|tweeted]] that within hours of the NFL releasing its report, lawyers for several players were already telling him that their clients were considering legal action against the Saints and Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2012/3/2/2840419/new-orleans-saints-bounty-program-lawsuits/in/2604084|title=Players Injured By New Orleans Saints Could Take Legal Action|last=McCauley|first=Kevin|publisher=[[SB Nation]]|date=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[San Francisco 49ers]] quarterback [[Steve Young]], who has a law degree from [[J.

However, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|10th Circuit Court of Appeals]] disagreed, saying that "the general customs of football" do not include deliberately attempting to injure opposing players.&lt;ref name=FoxLegal&gt;{{cite news|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/gregg-williams-new-orleans-saints-bounty-issue-may-have-legal-implications-for-nfl-030812|title=Bounty issue could be NFL legal problem|last=Perez|first=A.

On April 5, documentary filmmaker [[Sean Pamphilon]] released audio of a meeting Williams held with his defense before their 2012 divisional playoff game against the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. In a profanity-laced speech, Williams instructed his players to deliberately try to injure several 49ers players. He ordered his men to try to knock out running back [[Kendall Hunter]], even if it meant hitting him out of bounds. He specifically directed them to try to [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|tear]] wide receiver [[Michael Crabtree]]'s [[anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]], injure tight end [[Vernon Davis]]' ankles and go after kick returner [[Kyle Williams (wide receiver)|Kyle Williams]] specifically because he had a history of concussions. He also appeared to put a bounty on quarterback [[Alex Smith]]; according to Pamphilon, after Williams told his men to hit Smith in the chin, "then he rubs his thumb against his index and middle fingers – the cash sign – and says, ''I got the first one. I got the first one. Go get it. Go lay that motherfucker out.''" Pamphilon, who was doing a documentary on [[Steve Gleason]] and his fight against Lou Gehrig's Disease, released the audio to [[Yahoo!

The Saints were also fined $500,000—the maximum fine permitted under the league constitution, and had to forfeit their second-round draft picks in 2012 and 2013 (their first-round pick in 2012 had already been traded to the [[New England Patriots]], and therefore, could not be forfeited; after the penalty; the Saints' first pick in the [[2012 NFL Draft]] is a third-rounder)&lt;ref name=NFLPenalties/&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPNPenaltyAnnouncement/&gt; He also gave the league's clubs until March 30, 2012 to certify in writing that they do not have bounty programs.

In a statement, Goodell said that the NFL would not tolerate "conduct or a culture" that put player safety at risk. He also said that the fact that the scheme went on for three years demanded that "a strong and lasting message must be sent that such conduct is totally unacceptable and has no place in the game."&lt;ref name=NFLPenalties/&gt; He was particularly upset that those involved had lied about the scheme on two separate investigations, and had denied that there was ever a bounty program in place. In an interview with [[NFL Network]]'s [[Rich Eisen]], Goodell said that the threat to player safety, as well as the fact the Saints lied about it, demanded significant punishment. "I don't think you can be too hard on people that put at risk our players' health and safety," Goodell told Eisen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d827c28ff/article/goodell-sounds-off-on-saints-bounty-penalties|title=Commissioner Goodell says NFL was misled in 'bounty' probe|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reiterated this in an interview later that day with ESPN's Schefter, saying that the fact those involved "continued to mislead" the league about it was a significant factor in the sanctions. "You have to be accountable and responsible in the NFL," Goodell said. Goodell also implied that Payton would have faced significant punishment in any event, since his contractual obligation to supervise his assistants meant that he at least should have known about the scheme. He also said that there would be zero tolerance for payments for in-game performance in the future, saying that payments for good play eventually escalate to bounties for deliberately injuring players.&lt;ref name=GoodellSchefter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=7719075|title=Goodell talks punishments|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Schefter said on ESPN's [[SportsCenter]] that league officials felt Payton was at least as guilty as Williams, despite initial focus on Williams' role as the mastermind in the scheme.

On March 30, Payton, Vitt and Loomis appealed their suspensions, and the Saints also appealed the fine and loss of draft picks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/18164762/saints-payton-to-appeal-yearlong-suspension-on-friday|title=Saints, Payton, GM Loomis, assistant Vitt appealing bounty penalties|publisher=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Payton, Vitt and Loomis met with Goodell on April 5. After that meeting, Vitt's lawyer, David Cornwell, said that Payton and Loomis met with Williams before the divisional playoff game and ordered him to shut down the bounty program immediately. Cornwell contended that Williams was a "rogue coach," and the recently released audio of his meeting with the defense only proved it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8281b86a/article/attorney-for-saints-joe-vitt-says-gregg-williams-went-rogue|title=Attorney for Saints' Joe Vitt says Gregg Williams went 'rogue'|last=Wyche|first=Steve|publisher=NFL.com|date=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodell denied the appeals on April 9, meaning that Payton's suspension began as of April 16. However, depending on the Saints' cooperation and that of the individuals involved, Goodell could restore the Saints' second-round pick in 2013 (though the Saints would still lose a lower-round pick), as well as reduce the fine on the Saints and restore Payton, Vitt and Loomis' lost pay. However, all appeals were denied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7792405/nfl-upholds-suspension-new-orleans-saints-sean-payton-mickey-loomis-joe-vitt|title=NFL denies Saints' appeals|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Players===
The NFLPA requested that the league should hold off on any punishments for the players until it conducts its own investigation.&lt;ref name=ESPNPenaltyAnnouncement/&gt; Goodell told Schefter, however, that he would hand down punishments to the players involved very soon once he gets feedback from the NFLPA.&lt;ref name=GoodellSchefter/&gt;

Hours after the sanctions were announced, Kluwe went on [[KSTP (AM)|KSTP]] in the Twin Cities and demanded that any players involved in the scheme be severely punished, and that the NFLPA let it be known that "there's no place in the league for that kind of behavior." He even went as far as to call for Vilma—the only player specifically named as being involved in the scheme in the NFL's initial announcements—to be banned from the league for life.&lt;ref name=Zulgad&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.1500espn.com/sportswire/Zulgad_Chris_Kluwe_thinks_Jonathan_Vilma_should_be_banned_from_NFL032212|title=Chris Kluwe thinks Jonathan Vilma should be banned from NFL|last=Zulgad|first=Judd|publisher=[[KSTP (AM)]]|date=2012-03-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324203456/http://www.1500espn.com/sportswire/Zulgad_Chris_Kluwe_thinks_Jonathan_Vilma_should_be_banned_from_NFL032212|archivedate=2012-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sentiments were echoed a day later by Vikings center [[John Sullivan (American football)|John Sullivan]], who told [[KFXN-FM]] in the Twin Cities that any Saint who deliberately tried to hurt Favre in that game should get a lifetime ban. Sullivan called the Saints' treatment of Favre "despicable" and "the exact opposite of sportsmanship," and even called for the league to take some sort of action against players involved in that game who had since retired, such as McCray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/39950/john-sullivan-saints-were-despicable|title=John Sullivan: Saints were "despicable"|last=Seifert|first=Kevin|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 2012, the NFL suspended four then-current or former Saints players for their involvement in the bounty scandal:
* Vilma was suspended for the entire [[2012 NFL season]].&lt;ref name="ESPNplayers" /&gt;
* Former Saints defensive tackle [[Anthony Hargrove]] was suspended for eight games.
* Saints defensive end [[Will Smith (American football)|Will Smith]] was suspended for four games.
* Former Saints linebacker [[Scott Fujita]] (then with the [[Cleveland Browns]], now retired) was suspended for three games.

Vilma's suspension took effect immediately, while the other three players are allowed to attend training camp. In announcing the suspensions, Goodell said that while a large number of players took part in the program, he chose to suspend those players who "were in leadership positions at the Saints; contributed a particularly large sum of money toward the program; specifically contributed to a bounty on an opposing player; demonstrated a clear intent to participate in a program that potentially injured opposing players; sought rewards for doing so; and/or obstructed the 2010 investigation." The NFL determined that Vilma and Smith helped Williams start the bounty program. Hargrove lied to league officials during the 2010 investigation, but later signed a letter to the NFL admitting that he was active participant in the scheme. He also told at least one other player that the Saints had put a bounty on Favre in the 2009 NFC title game. Fujita, who left the team for the Browns immediately after the Saints won [[Super Bowl XLIV]], pledged "a significant amount of money" into the bounty program.&lt;ref name=NFLPlayerPenalties&gt;[http://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/5-2-12-saints-players1.pdf NFL announcement of player sanctions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, Goodell had indicated that he was going to come down hard on the players involved, telling Eisen that they "enthusiastically embraced" the scheme. "They are on the field, so so I don't think they are absolved from any responsibility because of that," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8288d646/article/goodell-new-orleans-saints-players-embraced-bounties|title=Goodell: New Orleans Saints players 'embraced' bounties|last=Hanzus|first=Dan|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFLPA released a statement calling the suspensions unjustified, claiming that Goodell had not furnished them with any evidence supporting the sanctions.&lt;ref name="ESPNplayers" /&gt; The union lodged a formal grievance on May 4, contending that since the suspensions were for on-field misconduct, the players' appeals should be heard by [[Ted Cottrell]] and [[Art Shell]], whom the collective bargaining agreement designates as the hearing officers for on-field sanctions. It also contended that since the alleged conduct took place before the most recent CBA was signed in August, Goodell should have deferred to NFL [[special master]] [[Stephen B. Burbank|Stephen Burbank]] in ruling on the players' actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/18964180/union-bounty-grievance-goodell-has-no-authority-to-punish-hear-appeals|title=Union bounty grievance: Goodell has no authority to punish, hear appeals|publisher=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodell issued the suspensions as part of his power to sanction any "conduct detrimental to the integrity and public confidence in the NFL," a violation of Article 46 of the CBA. This provision is normally used to sanction off-field conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2012/05/new_orleans_saints_suspended_p.html|title=New Orleans Saints suspended players' appeals face uphill battle: expert|last=Varney|first=James|work=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a league source told CBSSports.com's Judge that it also gives Goodell the power to rule on in-game conduct if he feels that it runs counter to the integrity of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/18964610/legal-expert-union-may-be-fighting-losing-battle-in-bounty-grievances|title=Legal expert: Union may be fighting losing battle in bounty grievances|last=Judge|first=Clark|publisher=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 2012, [[Jonathan Vilma]] and seven witnesses from the Saints testified in front of a federal judge in New Orleans that Goodell got his facts wrong in the bounty scandal. "Everybody was sworn in under oath in front of a judge with the risk of perjury and jail time if we were lying, and categorically denied there was a bounty," Vilma said in a text message to ESPN's Ed Werder. "Seven people testified, 2 sworn affidavits (one by Drew Brees) all saying the same thing. I ask that you and ESPN report the facts. No more bias or b.s. or hearsay. I gave you facts that you can report if so choose."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Tulane University Sports Law Program Director Gabe Feldman (who attended the hearing in court) said, "Clearly the judge, by her questions, indicated she thinks Goodell overstepped his authority, and this case was always going to be about if he executed his power fairly... The NFL's retort is that with all due deference, you don't get to second guess (commissioner Roger Goodell). Judges only have limited jurisdiction over arbitration issues."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

All four players appealed their suspensions. On September 7, 2012, the Burbank appeals panel vacated the suspensions imposed on the four, and the NFL confirmed that the ruling reinstated them in time for their first games of the 2012 season two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chase|first=Chris|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2012/09/saints-players-have-suspensions-lifted-are-available-for-season-opener/1#.UEpk6rKPUl8|title=Saints bounty players have suspensions lifted, are available for season opener|work=USA Today|accessdate=7 September 2012|date=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after the fifth game of the season, on October 9, 2012, the league re-issued the suspensions without any changes or reductions; the players' appeals continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brooks|first=Matt|title=Report: NFL re-issues bounty suspensions for Saints players|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2012/10/09/nfl-re-issues-bounty-suspensions-for-saints-players/|work=The Washington Times|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 27, 2012, former league commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] postponed the bounty appeals hearing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000085951/article/nfl-postpones-new-orleans-saints-bounty-appeals-hearing|title=NFL postpones New Orleans Saints bounty appeals hearing|publisher=NFL|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; expecting to set a new schedule on October 29, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000085952/article/paul-tagliabue-postpones-bounty-appeals-hearing|title=Paul Tagliabue postpones bounty appeals hearing|publisher=NFL|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 11, with three games left in the regular season, Tagliabue vacated the players' suspensions, saying in his ruling, "I affirm Commissioner Goodell's factual findings as to the four players. I conclude that Hargrove, Smith and Vilma—but not Fujita—engaged in 'conduct detrimental to the integrity of, and public confidence in, the game of professional football ..." He laid primary responsibility for the scandal on Williams and Payton.&lt;ref name=Tagliabuevacate&gt;[http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8736662/paul-tagliabue-vacates-new-orleans-players-bounty-penalties Paul Tagliabue vacates penalties]. [[ESPN]], 2012-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Had the suspensions of Vilma and Hargrove been upheld, they would have been the longest for an on-field incident in modern NFL history, topping the previous record set in [[2006 NFL season|2006]], when then-Titans defensive end [[Albert Haynesworth]] was given a five-game suspension for stomping on the head of [[Dallas Cowboys]] offensive lineman [[Andre Gurode]].

Vilma played the final 11 games of the 2012 season for the Saints; Smith played all 16. Fujita played the first four games of the season for the Browns before suffering a season-ending (and ultimately, career-ending) neck injury;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/season-over-browns-lb-scott-163452126--nfl.html|title=Season, maybe career, over for Browns' Fujita|publisher=[[Yahoo!

Nonetheless, the loss of Payton, combined with the distractions caused by the scandal, proved too much for the Saints to overcome. After finishing 13–3 and reaching the Divisional round of the playoffs a year earlier, they finished 7–9 and missed the playoffs.

==Media reaction==
The behavior detailed in the report was almost universally condemned in the press. In an editorial, New Orleans' local paper ''[[The Times-Picayune]]'' called the revelations "an embarrassment for one of the most successful and beloved sports organizations of recent years," and that they were "particularly hard to take for (Saints') fans" in light of the Saints' rebound after [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/opinions/index.ssf/2012/03/bounty_program_scandal_is_a_bl.html|title=Saints 'bounty program' is a black eye for a beloved franchise|work=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESPN columnist [[Gregg Easterbrook]] claimed that the Saints' behavior threatened the very integrity of the sport since high school and youth players have long emulated what they see in the NFL. He also claimed that NFL Network yanked its planned replay of the 2009 NFC Championship Game due to concern that fans might look more closely for late hits that should have been called.&lt;ref name=Easterbrook /&gt;

Most of the players who were the targets of questionable hits by the Saints, including Favre and Warner, claimed the bounties were merely part of the game.&lt;ref name="FoxLegal" /&gt; However, several former players interviewed by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' said that while payments for good hits and sacks were indeed considered part of the game, bounties for intentionally injuring opponents violated an unwritten code. One of those interviewed, [[Junior Seau]], bluntly said that such practices crossed the line into threatening a person's livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1195696/index.htm|title=The Conscience Of The Locker Room|last=Trotter|first=Jim|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Seau would commit [[suicide]] less than two months after the interview was published; it was discovered after his death that he suffered from [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE) as a result of the numerous head injuries Seau suffered during his 20-year NFL career.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/8830344/study-junior-seau-brain-shows-chronic-brain-damage-found-other-nfl-football-players|title=Study: Junior Seau's brain shows chronic brain damage found in other NFL football players|publisher=ESPN.com|date=January 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seau's sentiments were echoed by Hall of Fame quarterback [[Fran Tarkenton]]. In an op-ed for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Tarkenton wrote that he played against the likes of [[Mean Joe Greene]], [[Ray Nitschke]] and [[Dick Butkus]], and none of them even considered deliberately trying to hurt him. He also said that he discussed the issue with several players from his era, and they unanimously agreed that players who put bounties on opponents were "cowards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203370604577265522200050922|title=Football's Bounty Hunters Must Be Clipped|last=Tarkenton|first=Fran|authorlink=Fran Tarkenton|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin Seifert, who blogs on the [[NFC North]] for ESPN.com, wrote that neither he nor most Vikings fans were surprised at the discovery of the bounty program. Seifert argued that even before the findings were revealed, it was obvious that the Saints were determined to inflict a severe beating on Favre, even if it meant breaking the rules. The only difference in Seifert's mind was that he no longer believed the Saints were out of control. Rather, he wrote, they were acting as "part of a larger mentality" instilled by Williams.&lt;ref name=Seifert/&gt;

Speculation quickly abounded about how severely Goodell, who has made player safety and the overall integrity of the game a point of emphasis during his six years as commissioner, would punish Williams and the Saints. In his weekly "Monday Morning Quarterback" column on March 5, ''SI''{{'}}s [[Peter King (sportswriter)|Peter King]] wrote that he believed Williams faced at least an eight-game suspension, and that Payton and Loomis would almost certainly be suspended as well. He also argued that Goodell would have no choice but to come down hard on the Saints, given that the league was facing numerous lawsuits brought by former players who suffered head injuries. Given the circumstances, King said, Goodell had a lot of incentive to "issue a string of suspensions the likes of which the league has never seen."&lt;ref name=KingMarch5/&gt; In an article written for the March 12 edition of ''SI'', King wrote that league officials were so outraged that they were likely to hand down penalties similar to the season-long bans [[Paul Hornung]] and [[Alex Karras]] received in 1963 for gambling.&lt;ref name=KingOutofBounds/&gt; Freeman wrote that his sources in the league office had told him that the players, Williams, Payton and Loomis would all face suspensions of at least six games, as well as heavy fines. Freeman's sources also said that Payton's sanctions were likely to dwarf those handed down to the [[New England Patriots]]' [[Bill Belichick]] in the wake of the [[2007 National Football League videotaping controversy|2007 "Spygate"]] affair. He also believed that Goodell was going to use the scandal to "end the practice of bounty football forever," much like the penalties imposed against the Patriots after "Spygate" effectively ended the longstanding practice of illicit videotaping.&lt;ref name=Freeman2/&gt;

After the sanctions were announced, CBSSports.com's [[Gregg Doyel]] wrote that the severity of the punishments handed down to Williams, Payton and Loomis proved that Goodell was truly sincere in his desire to "take the thuggishness out of the NFL." Doyel also said that while many players had chafed at what they saw as Goodell's heavy-handed approach to discipline, he was actually standing up for their safety in the Saints' case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/17950395/long-seen-as-their-enemy-goodell-comes-down-decisively-for-players|title=Long seen as their enemy, Goodell comes down decisively for players|last=Doyel|first=Gregg|authorlink=Gregg Doyel|publisher=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pereira, now an analyst for Fox Sports, wrote that based on his experience in the league office, he wasn't surprised that Goodell came down hard on the Saints. He recalled that Goodell was always upset when officials didn't penalize hits on defenseless players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/Roger-Goodell-New-Orleans-Saints-Bountygate-proves-commitment-to-player-safety-032212|title=Goodell shows commitment to player safety|last=Pereira|first=Mike|authorlink=Mike Pereira|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]|date=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revelation of Williams' pregame speech was also greeted with revulsion. ESPN NFL analyst and former [[Dallas Cowboys]] safety [[Darren Woodson]] said that much of Williams' speech was standard pregame rhetoric. According to Woodson, when Williams called for his men to "attack the head" of running back [[Frank Gore]], he was saying that the 49ers' offense would be rendered ineffective if they managed to shut Gore down. However, Woodson felt that several parts of Williams' speech—particularly his calls to go after Crabtree's ACL and target Williams specifically because he had concussions in the past—went too far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:7778213|title=Williams Crossed the Line|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; His former teammate, NFL Network analyst [[Michael Irvin]], said that he "almost threw up" when he heard Williams tell his men to go after Crabtree's ACL, saying that players are taught from youth football onward to "never take out a man's knees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/videos/new-orleans-saints/09000d5d8281da6d/Michael-Irvin-s-thoughts-on-Saints-bounties|title=Michael Irvin's thoughts on Saints' bounties|publisher=[[NFL Network]]|date=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox Sports' Mark Kriegel argued that the tape proved Williams was "woefully underpunished," especially since he made the speech after being alerted that the NFL had reopened its investigation. He called for Goodell to ban him from the league for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/Gregg-Williams-New-Orleans-Saints-Bountygate-must-be-banned-for-life-040512|title=Ban Williams from NFL for good|last=Kriegel|first=Mark|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]|date=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NFL Network analyst [[Michael Lombardi (sportscaster)|Michael Lombardi]] wrote that the scandal happened in part because during Williams' previous stops as a defensive coordinator, the head coaches under which he worked—Fisher, [[Joe Gibbs]] and Payton—essentially ceded him complete authority over the defense. Lombardi claimed that as a result, Williams operated essentially as "an independent contractor." Lombardi argued that such a situation is "never fully sustainable," as it can easily lead to the head coach losing control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82821ba1/article/williams-independentcontractor-status-fueled-rogue-mentality|title=Williams' independent-contractor status fueled rogue mentality|last=Lombardi|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Lombardi (sportscaster)|publisher=[[NFL.com]]|date=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the media outcry, an independent study speculated that Saints' players may have pretended to participate off the field but not put the tactics into action on the field. "If the Saints tended to injure more players, then teams that played them would tend to list more injuries the following week. To test whether the Saints injured more players than a typical team, one need only compare the number of players added to injury reports after a Saints game to the league-wide average. Did the New Orleans Saints injure more players? The data-driven answer is a resounding 'no.' The Saints appear to have injured far fewer players over the 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons. The numbers are striking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aei.org/article/economics/the-saints-aint-sinners/|title=The Saints ain't sinners|last1=Hassett|first1=Kevin|authorlink=Kevin Hassett|last2=Veuger|first2=Stan|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Owney''' (ca. 1887 – June 11, 1897), was a [[Border terrier]] adopted as the first unofficial postal [[mascot]] by the [[Albany, New York]], post office about 1888. The Albany mail professionals recommended the dog to their [[Railway Mail Service]] colleagues, and he became a nationwide mascot for 9 years (1888–97).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=2&amp;cmd=1&amp;id=236 |title=French Republic Owney tag |accessdate=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled throughout the 48 contiguous United States and voyaged around the world traveling over 140,000 miles in his lifetime as a mascot of the Railway Post Office and the [[United States Postal Service]]. He is best known for being the subject of commemorative activities, including a 2011 U.S. [[postage stamp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://about.usps.com/postal-bulletin/2011/pb22314/html/info_006.htm |title=Stamp Announcement 11-33: Owney the Postal Dog|date=July 27, 2011| publisher= U.S. Postal Service|accessdate=November 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Story==
[[File:OwneyDog.jpg|thumb|right|Owney's [[Taxidermy|preserved]] body is on display at the Smithsonian [[National Postal Museum]] (NPM) in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]

===Unofficial mascot===
Owney belonged to a clerk at the Albany post office who would often come with him to work.  Owney seemed to love the smell of the [[mail bag]]s and would sleep on the bags. The clerk quit the Albany post office but knew that Owney was happier at the post office with the mail bags.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian podcast Sidedoor, episode 14. https://www.si.edu/sidedoor/ep-14-many-lives-owney-dog&lt;/ref&gt;

Owney usually slept on the mail bags and when they were moved, Owney went with them. He was considered to be good luck by postal railway clerks, since no train he ever rode on was in a wreck.&lt;ref name="Pope"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/pdf/Postmasters_Advocate_Owney_article-2011-04.pdf |date=April 2011 |work=Postmasters Advocate |format=PDF |first1=Nancy A., Historian National Postal Museum |last1=Pope |title=The Post Office's Best Friend: Owney the Mail Dog |pages=46–52 |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a welcome addition in any [[railway post office]]; he was a faithful guardian of railway mail and the bags it was carried in, and would not allow anyone other than mail clerks to touch the bags.&lt;ref name="Pope" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cushing"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/storyofourpostof00cush/storyofourpostof00cush_djvu.txt |last1=Cushing |first1=Marshall |title=The Story of Our Post Office: The Greatest Government Department in all its Phases |location=Boston, Massachusetts |page=84 |publisher=A. M. Thayer &amp; Co |year=1893 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was an important duty and Owney was well-situated for it, as the Albany train station was a key division point on the [[New York Central]] railroad system, one of the two largest railroads in the U.S. at that time. Mail trains from Albany rolled eastward to [[Boston]], south to [[New York City]], and westward to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Cleveland]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Chicago]], and points further west. As a contemporary book recounted: "The terrier 'Owney' travels from one end of the country to the other in the postal cars, tagged through, petted, talked to, looked out for, as a brother, almost. But sometimes, no matter what the attention, he suddenly departs for the south, the east, or the west, and is not seen again for months."&lt;ref name="Cushing" /&gt; In 1893 he was feared dead after having disappeared, but it turned out he was involved in an accident in Canada.&lt;ref name="Cushing" /&gt;
[[File:Owney with tags.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Owney with some of his dog tags]]
[[File:Illustration of Owney on Mail Sack.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Owney on mail pouch]]
As Owney's trips grew longer, the postal clerks at Albany became concerned that the dog be identified, and, if necessary returned to them. They bought a [[dog collar]] with a metal tag that read: "Owney, Post Office, Albany, New York". To this collar, the various railway post offices that saw Owney added individual [[Pet tag|dog tags]]. The collar and tags made the mixed-breed terrier the unofficial mascot of the U.S. Railway Mail Service, and as shown by the 2011 postage stamp issued in his honor, his identifications became an essential element of his identity.&lt;ref name="Pope" /&gt;

Owney received tags everywhere he went, and as he moved they jingled like [[sleigh bell]]s.&lt;ref name="NPM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2c1f_owney.html |title=Owney, Mascot of the Railway Mail Service |publisher=National Postal Museum |accessdate=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received from Winnona Kilbridge of the Los Angeles Kennel Club a medal for "Best Traveled Dog" of 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Wales, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Owney received in 1894 from a Mr. William Winter Wagner of Chicago a "Globe Trotter" medal.&lt;ref&gt;Wales, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; His collection of tags grew so large that [[United States Postmaster General]] [[John Wanamaker]] gave him a coat to display them all.&lt;ref name="Stamp" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/museum/1d_Wanamaker_Portrait.html |publisher=Smithsonian Institution, National Postal Museum |title=Former Object of the Month: John Wanamaker Portrait |first1=Nancy A. |last1=Pope |date=March 2007|accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wanamaker also announced that Owney was then the Official Mascot of the Rail Mail Service.&lt;ref&gt;Wales, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; It is said to be impossible to know how many dog tags and medals Owney received. Despite the jacket, the mass became impossible for the small dog to carry. Clerks would remove tags and forward them to Albany or Washington D.C. for safekeeping. One source suggests that 1,017 medals and tokens were bestowed upon the mascot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.madisoncountycourier.com/2011/07/24/owney-the-postal-dog/ |title=Owney the Postal Dog |first1=Bob |last1=Betz |date=July 24, 2011 |work=[[Madison County Courier]] |location=Hamilton County, New York |accessdate=July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these tags did not survive; the National Postal Museum currently has 372 Owney tags in its collections.&lt;ref name="Pope" /&gt; Other Owney tokens, trinkets, and medals are also in the NPM collection and are displayed there.&lt;ref name="Pope" /&gt;

One of Owney's services "Above and Beyond the Call of Duty" reported is when he stayed behind to protect a [[mail pouch]] that had accidentally fallen out of a wagon during a delivery route he was on. When the clerks returned to the main Post Office after the deliveries, not only was a bag of mail missing but so was Owney. They backtracked their steps and eventually found Owney lying on top of the mailbag. Owney guarded the mail pouch until someone from the Post Office showed up.&lt;ref&gt;Wales, pp. 14–17&lt;/ref&gt;

===International mail===
One of his more famous trips was to [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. There the postmaster kept him in a kennel. A demand was sent to Albany, New York for payment for the $2.50 that was incurred in feeding him. The sum was collected, and Owney was sent back home.&lt;ref name="Rees"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Jerry |last1=Rees |first2=Stephen Michael |last2=Schwartz |url=http://www.npm.si.edu/owneyebook/ |title=Owney: Tales from the Rails |publisher=National Postal Museum Smithsonian Institution |year=2011 |format=[[E-book]]|accessdate=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Universal Postal Union]] was created by treaty in 1874 to standardize the shipping and handling of international mail; adherence to this pact by an increasing number of countries around what was then called the "civilized world" made it possible to extend Owney's horizons a bit. In 1895, the terrier enjoyed an [[Circumnavigation|around-the-world trip]], riding with mail bags aboard trains and steamships. Starting from Tacoma, Washington, on August 19, he traveled for four months throughout Asia and across Europe, before returning to New York City on December 23 and from thence to Albany.&lt;ref name="Pope" /&gt;&lt;ref name="postalmuseum.si.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/owneystampart/index.html |title=Art of the Stamp: Owney the Postal Dog |publisher=Smithsonian Institution/National Postal Museum |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return during Christmas week, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that he visited Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East.&lt;ref name="lat-1895dec25"&gt;{{cite news |title=Owney's Travels.: On the Home-stretch of a Round-the World Tour|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 25, 1895 |page=1 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/163785236/ |publisher=[[ProQuest]] |accessdate=October 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another report claimed the [[Emperor of Japan]] awarded the dog two passports and several medals bearing the [[Japanese coat of arms]]. Owney’s triumphant return to American shores was covered by newspapers nationwide.&lt;ref name="Wogan"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thebark.com/content/owney-will-travel-mail-again-updated |title=Owney Will Travel with the Mail Again: Railway Mail Service mascot gets his own stamp |first1=Lisa |last1=Wogan |work=The Bark |date=July 8, 2011 |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roanoke"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95079481/1896-07-24/ed-1/seq-6/ |title=Owney the Dog, He Has Traveled Almost Around the World |work=[[The Roanoke Times|The Roanoke Daily Times]] |location=Roanoke, Virginia |date=July 24, 1896 |page=6, col. 1–2 |accessdate=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owney became world famous after the trip, even though he broke no speed records in doing it.&lt;ref name="Pope" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roanoke" /&gt;

===Death and honors===

As Owney aged, Post Office management came to believe that his traveling days were over. Mail clerk J. M. Elben, of St. Louis, agreed to take him in,&lt;ref name="Pope" /&gt; and the influential Chicago manager of the Railway Mail Service, using insulting language to refer to the "mongrel cur", asked his employees not to allow him to ride on future mail trains.&lt;ref name="Pope" /&gt; Owney had by this time traveled more than {{convert|143,000|mi|km}} in his lifetime.&lt;ref name="Pope" /&gt;&lt;ref name="postalmuseum.si.edu" /&gt; Unnamed St. Louis letter carriers appear to have passively-aggressively resisted this executive guidance, and in summer 1897 Owney boarded a mail train one final time. The exact details of the incident which led to his death are unclear, but according to the National Postal Museum website, "Owney rode the train one last time before he died." Newspapers around the country carried the story of Owney's death. They reported that Owney had been ill and had become aggressive in his old age. In June 1897, after allegedly attacking a postal clerk and a U.S. Marshal in Toledo, Ohio, Owney was shot and killed on the orders of the local postmaster.&lt;ref name="Pope" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Dog Owney Dead at Last|newspaper=[[The News Tribune|Tacoma Daily News]]|date=12 June 1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roadside"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/3624 |title=Owney, Stuffed Dog Postal Mascot |publisher=[[Roadside America]] |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicago Tribune]] termed it "an execution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.toledogazette.wordpress.com/2011/07/26/owney-the-famous-postal-dog-met-his-tragic-demise-in-toledo/ |title=Owney the famous postal dog met his tragic demise in Toledo |first1=Lou |last1=Hebert |location=Toledo, Ohio |publisher=[[Toledo Gazette]] |date=July 26, 2011 |accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary accounts suggest that a postal clerk in Toledo chained Owney to a post in the corner of a basement at a post office in Toledo, which was not his normal treatment. And that clerk called in a reporter for the local paper to get a story. Owney may not have been used to that treatment and that may have contributed to his aggression. Whatever the reason, it is not disputed that Owney was put down in Toledo on 11 June 1897.

Owney's death made public that a gap existed between the workplace attitudes of U.S. postal clerks and their management, with the deceased dog serving as a focus of this gap. The 1890s were a foundational decade for the new discipline of [[scientific management]], with consultants like [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] seeking to help managers reduce what they saw as industrial inefficiencies by examining workers' "wasted time" and "slacking". Postal clerks used Owney's death, and the expressions of sadness contained in press [[obituaries]] in honor of the dog, to make a statement: "Postal clerks refused to bury their beloved mascot. Clerks across the country asked that the dog receive the honor they considered he was due by being preserved and presented to the Post Office Department's headquarters."&lt;ref name="Porter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsdesk.si.edu/snapshot/owney-the-dog |title=Smithsonian Snapshot: Owney the Dog, 1911 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |first1=Jessica |last1=Porter |accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owney's remains were preserved and sent for [[taxidermy]].&lt;ref name="Pope" /&gt; In 1904, Owney's effigy was displayed by the Postal Service at the [[St. Louis World's Fair]]. A commemorative [[silver spoon]] was commissioned by Cleveland, Ohio postal workers and fashioned by [[Webb C. Ball|"Webb C. Ball Co. Cleveland.O."]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=2&amp;cmd=1&amp;id=168017&amp;pg=1&amp;mode=2&amp;tid=2032209&amp; |first1= Nancy A. |last1=Pope |publisher=National Postal Museum |date=April 4, 2006|title=Owney Silver Spoon |accessdate=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owney is the subject of an exhibit at the [[Smithsonian]] Museum.&lt;ref name="Roadside" /&gt;&lt;ref name="childs"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/Owney-the-Mail-Dog.html |first1=Arcynta Ali |last1=Childs |work=[[Smithsonian magazine]] |date=September 2011 |title=Owney the Mail Dog |accessdate=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent there in 1911, and has been called one of the museum's "most interesting" artifacts.&lt;ref group="upper-alpha"&gt;The Smithsonian has 137 million artifacts, works of art and specimens in its collection. {{cite web |url=http://newsdesk.si.edu/snapshot/owney-the-dog |title=Smithsonian Snapshot: Owney the Dog, 1911 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |first1=Jessica |last1=Porter |accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Porter" /&gt; His remains deteriorated over the intervening century, and were (along with associated artifacts) given an extensive makeover in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/owney-the-mail-service-mascot-gets-makeover-and-his-own-stamp/2011/07/21/gIQAFnmDXI_story.html |title=Owney the mail service mascot gets makeover and his own stamp |first1=Lauren |last1=Abdel-Razzaq |publisher=Washington Post |date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="upper-alpha"&gt;The National Postal Museum is rated "worth a detour". {{cite web |url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/3624 |title=Owney, Stuffed Dog Postal Mascot |publisher=[[Roadside America]] |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the Smithsonian's employees opined the makeover a success, and called its culmination "the big reveal".&lt;ref name="Blasco"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postalmuseumblog.si.edu/2011/07/the-big-reveal-owney-the-dog-emerges-from-his-makeover.html |date=July 21, 2011 |title=The Big Reveal: Owney the Dog Emerges from his "Makeover" |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |first1=Erin |last1=Blasco |accessdate=July 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 27, 2011, the [[United States Postal Service]] issued a [[forever stamp]] honoring Owney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stamps.org/cac/owney/index.htm |title=Owney Resource Page |publisher=[[American Philatelic Society]] |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/aroundthemall/2011/07/honoring-owney-the-legendary-post-office-pup/?onsite_source=relatedarticles&amp;onsite_medium=internallink&amp;onsite_campaign=SmithMag&amp;onsite_content=Honoring%20Owney,%20the%20Legendary%20Post%20Office%20Pup |title=Honoring Owney the Postal Pup |publisher=Smithsonian.com |date=July 27, 2011 |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beyondtheperf.com/stamp-releases/owney-postal-dog |title=Owney the Postal Dog{{ndash}} First Day of Issue |date=July 27, 2011 |location=Washington, DC 20066 |accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artist [[Bill Bond (artist)|Bill Bond]] said he wanted to render the dog "in a spirited and lively" presentation, and that he wound up working from the mounted remains, as numerous trips to dog parks left him uninspired.&lt;ref name="Stamp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beyondtheperf.com/content/owney-postal-dog-globe-trotting-mascot-railway-mail-service |title=Owney the Postal Dog: Globe-Trotting Mascot of the Railway Mail Service |date=July 27, 2011 |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owney was also honored locally at the Albany, New York post office.&lt;ref name="Grondahl"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Owney-the-postal-dog-officially-has-his-day-1603732.php |title=Owney the postal dog officially has his day |first=Paul |last=Grondahl |location=Albany, New York |work=[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]] |date=July 27, 2011 |accessdate=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stamp was also central to an [[augmented reality]] [[Mobile app|app]] for [[MS Windows|Windows]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPhone]], [[iPad 2]] and [[iPod Touch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/owneyapp/faq-si.html |title=Owney |format=[[3D computer graphics|3-D]] [[Augmented reality|AR]] App for [[MS Windows|Windows]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPhone]], [[iPad 2]] and [[iPod Touch]] |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like his contemporary Australian counterpart{{mdash}} [[Bob the Railway Dog]] active from 1881–1894&lt;ref name="Sargent"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/bob-the-railway-dog-icon-of-australian-history.htm |title=Bob the railway dog: icon of Australian history |first1=Josephine |last1=Sargent |date=7 October 2011 |work=[[Australian Geographic]] |accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mdash}} he was the subject of poetry. One was from a clerk in Detroit:

:Owney is a tramp, as you can plainly see.
:Only treat him kindly, and take him 'long wid ye."&lt;ref name="Pope" /&gt;

Another was penned by a clerk in Minnesota:

:"On'y one Owney, and this is he;
:the dog is aloney, so let him be."&lt;ref name="Pope" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Owney has been the main character in five hard cover books, and one e-book published by the National Postal Museum (of the Smithsonian Institution) in 2012 titled, ''Owney: Tales from the Rails'', written by [[Jerry Rees]] with songs by [[Stephen Michael Schwartz]] and illustrations by [[Fred Cline]]. The book is narrated and songs are performed by [[Trace Adkins]].&lt;ref name="Rees" /&gt; http://www.npm.si.edu/owneyebook/

A '''peripheral nerve interface''' is the bridge between the [[peripheral nervous system]] and a [[computer interface]] which serves as a bi‐directional information [[transducer]] recording and sending signals between the human body and a [[machine processing|machine processor]]. Interfaces to the nervous system usually take the form of electrodes for stimulation and recording, though chemical stimulation and sensing are possible.&lt;ref name= "Warren"&gt;Grill, W. M., Norman, S. E., &amp; Bellamkonda, R. V. (2009). Implanted neural interfaces: biochallenges and engineered solutions. Annual review of biomedical engineering, 11, 1–24. doi:10.1146/annurev-bioeng-061008-124927&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this area is focused on developing peripheral nerve interfaces for the restoration of function following disease or injury to minimize associated losses. Peripheral nerve interfaces also enable electrical stimulation and recording of the peripheral nervous system to study the form and function of the peripheral nervous system. Many researchers also focus in the area of [[neuroprosthesis]], linking the human nervous system to [[Bionic hand#In medicine|bionics]] in order to mimic natural [[sensorimotor coupling|sensorimotor control]] and function.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"&gt;Donaldson PEK (1983). The Cooper cable: An Implantable Multiconductor cable for neurological prostheses. Med Biol Eng Comput 21:371-374&lt;/ref&gt; Successful implantation of peripheral nerve interfaces depend on a number of factors which include appropriate [[indication (medicine)|indication]], [[Perioperative| perioperative testing]], [[Differentiated instruction|differentiated planning]], and functional training.&lt;ref name="NavarroReview"&gt;Navarro, X., Krueger, T. B., Lago, N., Micera, S., Stieglitz, T., &amp; Dario, P. (2005). A critical review of interfaces with the peripheral nervous system for the control of neuroprostheses and hybrid bionic systems. Journal of the peripheral nervous system : JPNS, 10(3), 229–58. doi:10.1111/j.1085-9489.2005.10303.x&lt;/ref&gt; Typically [[microelectrode]] devices are implanted adjacent to, around or within the nerve trunk to establish contact with the peripheral nervous system. Different approaches may be used depending on the type of signal desired and attainable.

==Function==
The primary purpose of a [[neural interface]] is to enable two-way exchange of information with the nervous system for a sustained period of time to enable effective and high density stimulation and recording. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is responsible for relaying information from the brain and spinal cord to the extremities of the body and back. The function of a peripheral nerve interface is to assist the nervous system when peripheral nerve function is compromised. To supplement the roles of the nervous system, interfaces need to augment motor function as well as discern sensory information. The feasibility of peripheral nerve stimulation to achieve a desired motor output has been demonstrated and is one of the major driving forces for this area of research.&lt;ref name="Bhadra"&gt;Bhadra N, Peckham PH. 1997. Peripheral nerve stimulation for restoration of motor function. J. Clin. Neurophysiol. 14:378–93&lt;/ref&gt;  Information throughout the nervous system is exchanged primarily through [[action potential]]s. These signals occur at varying numbers and intervals dependent on both the [[neuroanatomy|neuroanatomical]] and [[neurochemical]] make up of the individual and localized region. Information may be either introduced or read out by inducing or recovering action potentials from the body. Successful development and implementation of a peripheral nerve interface would allow for both the introduction of information to the nervous system, and extraction of information from the nervous system.

==Problems and limitations==
Problems and limitations in peripheral nerve interfacing are both biophysical and biological in nature. These challenges&lt;ref name= "Warren" /&gt; include:
*Fidelity of the interface in terms of functional resolution
*Relatively weak, noise-ridden electrical signals causing a challenging interface design constraint
*Interface implantation-associated injury to nerve fibers of interest
*Stability of the interface over time due to inflammation
*Managing inadvertent consequences such as pain or false sensory/motor stimulation due to physical movement or inflammation-associated triggering of neural activity

==Application==

Res. 22:299–304 3.&lt;/ref&gt; restoration of motor function following [[spinal cord injury]] or [[stroke]],&lt;ref name= "Stein"&gt;Stein RB, Peckham PH, Popovic DB, eds. 1992.

==Types==
A wide variety of electrode designs have been researched, tested, and manufactured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6552092&amp;isnumber=6551989|title=M.

Research in this area seeks to address issues centered around peripheral nerve/tissue damage, access to efferent and afferent signals, and selective recording/stimulation of nerve tissue. Ideally peripheral nerve interfaces are optimally designed to interface with biological constraints of [[nerve fiber|peripheral nerve fibers]], match the [[list of materials properties#Mechanical properties|mechanical]] and [[list of materials properties#Electrical properties|electrical properties]] of the surrounding tissue, [[biocompatibility|biocompatible]] with minimal immune response, high [[sensor resolution#Resolution|sensor resolution]], are minimally [[Invasiveness|invasive]], and chronically stable with low [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s. Strongest signals are recorded from [[Node of Ranvier|nodes of ranvier]]. Peripheral nerve interfaces may be divided into extraneural and intrafascular categories.

===Epineurial electrode interface===
Epineurial electrodes are fabricated as longitudinal strips holding two or more contact sites to interface with peripheral nerves. These electrodes are placed on the nerve and secured by suturing to the epineurium. The suturing process requires delicate surgery and can be torn from the nerve if excessive motion creates tension. Since the electrode is sutured to the epineurium it is unlikely to damage the nerve trunk.

===Helicoidal electrode interface===
Helicoidal electrodes are placed cirumjacent to the nerve and are made of flexible platinum ribbon in a helical design. This design allows the electrode to conform to the size and shape of the nerve in attempts to minimize mechanical trauma. The structural design causes low selectivity. Helicoidal electrodes are currently used for FES stimulation of the [[vagus nerve]] to control intractable [[epilepsy]], [[sleep apnea]], and to treat depressive syndromes.

===Book electrode interface===
The book electrode consists of a silicone rubber block with slots. Each slot contains three platinum foils which function as electrodes, anode electrodes and one cathode. The spinal roots of the nerve are placed into these slots and the slots are then covered with a flap made of silicone and fixed with silicone glue. This electrode is mostly used to interrupt reflex circuits of the dorsal sacral roots and to control bladder function. Book electrodes are still considered very bulky.

'''Peter Spencer Connor''' (September 4, 1932 - March 8, 1966) was a [[United States Marine Corps]] staff sergeant who [[Posthumous recognition|posthumous]]ly received the [[Medal of Honor]] for absorbing the blast of his faulty-timered [[grenade]] rather than tossing it and risking nearby comrades in February 1966 in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].

==Biography==
Connor was born on September 4, 1932, in Orange, New Jersey. He attended elementary and high school in South Orange, New Jersey, graduating from [[Columbia High School (New Jersey)|high school]] in 1950.

Enlisting in the U.S. Marine Corps on February 5, 1952, he completed [[recruit training]] with the 2nd Recruit Training Battalion, [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island]], South Carolina. He was promoted to private first class upon graduation from Recruit Training in April 1952, and transferred to the West Coast, where he joined the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry Training Regiment. He joined the 1st Replacement Battalion after completing his advanced infantry training.

Arriving in [[Korea]] in August 1952, he was assigned as a [[fire team]] leader and radioman in the Third Platoon, Company B, [[1st Battalion 5th Marines|1st Battalion, 5th Marines]], [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]]. He was promoted to corporal in April 1953, while overseas.

Upon his return to the United States in October 1953, Corporal Connor served as a squad leader and [[platoon guide]] with Company B, [[1st Battalion 8th Marines|1st Battalion, 8th Marines]], [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd Marine Division]] at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune]], North Carolina, until released from active duty on February 4, 1955.

While on inactive duty, he was a member of the [[Marine Forces Reserve|Ready Reserve]] with the 4th and 1st Marine Corps Reserve and Recruitment Districts, and with 7th Rifle Company, USMCR, Lake Denmark, Dover, New Jersey. He was discharged from the Marine Corps Reserve in May 1961 to reenlist in the regular Marine Corps. Promoted to sergeant that same month, he was assigned as platoon guide with Casual Company, Headquarters Battalion, and with Company A, Schools Demonstration Troops, Marine Corps Schools, Quantico, Virginia.

Transferred to the West Coast in July 1962, he served as a platoon guide with Company B, [[1st Battalion 5th Marines|1st Battalion, 5th Marines]], 1st Marine Division at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]]. In November 1963, his unit was sent overseas and redesignated as Company F, [[2nd Battalion 3rd Marines|2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines]], [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]]. He served first as a [[platoon guide]], but prior to the unit's return the next November, he was assigned as a [[platoon sergeant]]. Upon the unit's return to Camp Pendleton, it was redesignated as Company B, [[1st Battalion 1st Marines|1st Battalion, 1st Marines]], 1st Marine Division. Sergeant Connor was promoted to staff sergeant on May 1, 1965 and that August his unit was again sent overseas, where it became a part of the 3rd Marine Division. Sergeant Connor was transferred, while overseas, to Company F, [[2nd Battalion 3rd Marines|2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines]], 3rd Marine Division and served as a platoon sergeant. He was serving with this unit when it was assigned to the 1st Marine Division in the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]]. It was during this period that Sergeant Connor's actions earned him the Medal of Honor. He was [[wounded in action]] on February 25, 1966 and [[killed in action|died of those wounds]] while on board the {{USS|Repose|AH-16|6}} on March 8, 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shulimson|first=Jack|title=U.S. Marines in Vietnam: An Expanding War 1966|publisher=History and Museums Division, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps|year=1982|url=https://archive.org/details/AnExpandingWar|isbn=978-1494285159|page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''STAFF SERGEANT PETER S. CONNOR'''&lt;br/&gt;
UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS
&lt;/center&gt;
for service as set forth in the following CITATION:

:For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action against enemy [[Viet Cong]] forces at the risk of his life above and beyond the call duty while serving as Platoon Sergeant of the Third Platoon, Company F, Second Battalion, Third Marines, Third Marine Division (Reinforced), [[Fleet Marine Force]], in Quang Ngai Province, [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]] on 25 February 1966. Leading his platoon on a [[search and destroy]] operation in an area made particularly hazardous by extensive cave and tunnel complexes, Sergeant Connor maneuvered his unit aggressively forward under intermittent enemy [[small arms|small-arms]] fire. Exhibiting particular alertness and keen observation, he spotted an enemy spider hole emplacement approximately fifteen meters to his front. He pulled the pin from a fragmentation grenade intending to charge the hole boldly and drop the missile into its depths. Upon pulling the pin he realized that the firing mechanism was faulty, and that even as he held the safety device firmly in place, the fuze charge was already activated. With only precious seconds to decide, he further realized that he could not cover the distance to the small opening of the spider hole in sufficient time, and that to hurl the deadly bomb in any direction would result in death or injury to some of his comrades tactically deployed near him. Manifesting extraordinary gallantry and with utter disregard for his personal safety, he chose to hold the grenade against his own body in order to absorb the terrific explosion and spare his comrades. His act of extreme valor and selflessness in the face of virtually certain death, although leaving him mortally wounded, spared many of his fellow Marines from death or injury. His gallant action in giving his life in the cause of freedom reflects the highest credit upon the Marine Corps and the [[United States Navy|United States Naval Service]].&lt;ref name=MOH_USMC&gt;"SSgt Peter S.

'''Philosophy of love''' is the field of [[social philosophy]] and [[ethics]] that attempts to [[explanation|explain]] the nature of [[love]].&lt;ref name="Singer2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Irving Singer|title=Philosophy of Love: A Partial Summing-Up|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4o3aGVUb85gC|accessdate=14 September 2012|date=31 March 2009|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-19574-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current theories==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}

There are many different theories that attempt to [[explanation|explain]] what [[love]] is, and what function it serves. It would be very difficult to explain love to a hypothetical person who had not himself or herself experienced love or being loved. In fact, to such a person love would appear to be quite strange if not outright irrational behavior. Among the prevailing types of theories that attempt to account for the existence of love there are: [[psychology|psychological]] theories, the vast majority of which consider love to be very healthy behavior; there are [[Evolutionary theory|evolutionary theories]] that hold that love is part of the process of [[natural selection]]; there are [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritual theories]] that may, for instance consider love to be a gift from God; there are also theories that consider love to be an unexplainable mystery, very much like a [[mysticism|mystical experience]].

===Classical roots===
Setting aside [[Empedocles]]'s view of [[Eros]] as the force binding the world together,&lt;ref&gt;Erotic, in Richard Gregory, ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (1987) p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; the roots of the classical philosophy of love go back to [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]''.&lt;ref name="Secomb2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Linnell Secomb|title=Philosophy and Love: From Plato to Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-CsfVa8imMC|accessdate=14 September 2012|date=1 June 2007|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-2368-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's Symposium digs deeper into the idea of love and bringing different interpretations and points of view in order to define love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://society-for-philosophy-in-practice.org/journal/pdf/4-3%2006%20Amir%20-%20Plato%20Love.pdf|title=Plato's theory of love: Rationality as Passion|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its riches, we may perhaps single out three main threads that would continue to reverberate through the centuries that followed.
#The idea of two loves, one heavenly, one earthly. As [[Uncle Toby]] was informed, over two millennia later, "of these loves, according to [[Marsilio Ficino|Ficinus]]'s comment on [[Francisco Vallés|Valesius]], the one is ''rational'' - the other is ''natural'' - the first...excites to the desire of philosophy and truth - the second, excites to desire, simply".&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Sterne, ''The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy'' (1976) p. 560-1&lt;/ref&gt;
#Aristophanes's conception of mankind as the product of the splitting in two of an original whole: [[Freud]] would later draw on this myth - "everything about these primaeval men was double: they had four hands and four feet, two faces"&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; - to support his theory of the [[repetition compulsion]].
#Plato's [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]] theory of love - "mounting upwards...from one to two, and from two to all fair forms, and from fair forms to fair actions, and from fair actions to fair notions, until from fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty".&lt;ref&gt;B. Jowett trans, ''The Essential Plato'' (1999) p. 746&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] by contrast placed more emphasis on philia (friendship, affection) than on eros (love);&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) p. 377-9&lt;/ref&gt; and the dialectic of friendship and love would continue to be played out into and through the [[Renaissance]],&lt;ref&gt;William C. Carroll ed., ''The Two Gentlemen of Verona'' (2004) p. 3-23&lt;/ref&gt; with Cicero for the Latins pointing out that "it is love (''amor'') from which the word 'friendship' (''amicitia'') is derived"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Carroll, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Lucretius]], building on the work of [[Epicurus]], had both praised the role of Venus as "the guiding power of the universe", and criticised those who become "love-sick...life's best years squandered in sloth and debauchery".&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius, ''On the Nature of the Universe'' (1961) p. 27 and p. 163-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Petrarchism===
Among his love-sick targets, [[Catullus]], along with others like [[Héloïse d'Argenteuil|Héloïse]], would find himself summoned in the 12C to a Love's Assize.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Waddell, ''The Wandering Scholars'' (1968) p. 20 and p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; From the ranks of such figures, and perhaps also under [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic]] influences, would emerge the concept of [[courtly love]];&lt;ref&gt;K. Clark, ''Civilisation'' (1969) p. 64-5&lt;/ref&gt; and from that [[Petrarch]]ism would form the rhetorical/philosophical foundations of [[romantic love]] for the early modern world.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gallic scepticism===
Alongside the passion for merging that marked Romantic love,&lt;ref&gt;Irving Singer, ''The Philosophy of Love'' (2009) p. 40M&lt;/ref&gt; a more sceptical French tradition can be traced from [[Stendhal]] onwards. Stendhal's theory of [[Crystallization (love)|crystallization]] implied an imaginative readiness for love, which only needed a single trigger for the object to be imbued with every phantasised perfection.&lt;ref&gt;Irving Singer, ''The Nature of Love'' (2009) p. 360-1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Proust]] went further, singling out absence, inaccessibility or [[jealousy]] as the necessary precipitants of love.&lt;ref&gt;G. Brereton, ''A Short History of French Literature'' (1954)  p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] would almost parody the tradition with his saying that "love is giving something you haven't got to someone who doesn't exist".&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Phillips (psychologist)|Adam Phillips]], ''On Flirtation'' (1994) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; A [[post-Lacanian]] like [[Luce Irigaray]] would then struggle to find room for love in a world that will "reduce the [[Other_(philosophy)#Sex and gender|other]] to the same...emphasizing eroticism to the detriment of love, under the cover of sexual liberation".&lt;ref&gt;Luce Irigaray, ''Sharing the World'' (2008) p. 49 and p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

{{expand section|date=October 2012}}
#Given what [[Max Weber]] called the intimate relationship between religion and sexuality,&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, ''The Sociology of Religion'' (1971) p.236&lt;/ref&gt; the role of the [[lingam]] and [[yoni]] in India, or of [[yin and yang]] in China, as a structuring form of cosmic polarity based on the male and female principles,&lt;ref&gt;Carl Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) p. 81 and p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; is perhaps more comprehensible. By way of [[maithuna]] or sacred intercourse,&lt;ref&gt;Sophy Hoare, ''Yoga'' (1980)  p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tantra]] developed a whole tradition of sacred sexuality,&lt;ref&gt;Margo Anand, ''The Art of Sexual Ecstasy'' (1990) p. 38-47&lt;/ref&gt; which led in its merger with [[Tantric Buddhism|Buddhism]] to a view of sexual love as a path to enlightenment: as [[Saraha]] put it, "That blissful delight that consists between lotus and vajra...removes all defilements".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in E. Conze, ''Buddhist Scriptures'' (1973) p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pokémon Ultra Sun''''' and '''''Ultra Moon'''''{{efn|{{Nihongo|''Pokémon Ultra Sun'' and ''Ultra Moon''|ポケットモンスター ウルトラサン・ウルトラムーン|Poketto Monsutā Urutora San・Urutora Mūn|"Pocket Monsters: Ultra Sun &amp; Ultra Moon"}}}} are [[role-playing video game]]s developed by [[Game Freak]], published by [[The Pokémon Company]] and [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo 3DS]]. The games were released worldwide on 17 November 2017. Announced in June 2017, the titles are enhanced versions of [[Pokémon Sun and Moon|''Pokémon Sun'' and ''Moon'']] with a modified storyline, similar to previous "upper versions" like ''[[Pokémon Yellow|Yellow]]'', [[Pokémon Crystal|''Crystal'']], ''[[Pokémon Emerald|Emerald]]'', and ''[[Pokémon Platinum|Platinum]]''. The games are the second installments in the [[Pokémon (video game series)#Seventh generation (2016–2017)|seventh generation]] of the main ''Pokémon'' RPGs for the [[Nintendo 3DS]].

The games are set in the [[Hawaii]]-based Alola region with an alternate storyline and introduce several new characters, Pokémon, forms, and gameplay features. As with previous titles in the series, the game follows a young trainer in a Pokémon-training journey across the region. The games feature new forms of the [[Legendary Pokémon]] [[Necrozma]] as version mascots.{{efn|Known as Dusk Mane Necrozma and Dawn Wings Necrozma, respectively fusions with the Pokémon Solgaleo featuring in ''Ultra Sun'' and Lunala featuring in ''Ultra Moon''.}}

The game received positive reception, with critics praising the additional features included over ''Sun'' and ''Moon''. By the end of 2017, the game had sold over seven million copies worldwide.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|Gameplay of Pokémon}}
Similar to previous games in the series, the games are [[role-playing video games]] with [[Adventure game|adventure]] elements. While set in an alternate Alola region, the mechanics and graphics remain largely the same as [[Pokémon Sun and Moon|''Pokémon Sun'' and ''Moon'']], with the primary differences being its modified storyline now including the Ultra Recon Squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2017/10/17/pokemon-ultra-sun-moon-isnt-a-sequel-has-a-different-main-story-with-other-worlds-to-visit/|title=Pokémon Ultra Sun &amp; Moon Isn’t A Sequel, Has A Different Main Story With Other Worlds To Visit - Siliconera|date=2017-10-17|work=Siliconera|access-date=2017-11-01|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107023855/http://www.siliconera.com/2017/10/17/pokemon-ultra-sun-moon-isnt-a-sequel-has-a-different-main-story-with-other-worlds-to-visit/|archivedate=2017-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player character designs are different with the first games, though they remain customizable.&lt;ref name="wwg" /&gt; "Global Missions", where players across the world work towards a collective goal, also made a return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tapsell|first1=Chris|title=Pokémon Ultra Sun Ultra Moon Global Missions - rewards, how to register and Global Mission targets explained|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-12-15-pokemon-ultra-sun-ultra-moon-global-missions-rewards-targets-how-to-register-4930|accessdate=2 January 2018|work=Eurogamer|date=15 December 2017|language=en-UK|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103073039/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-12-15-pokemon-ultra-sun-ultra-moon-global-missions-rewards-targets-how-to-register-4930|archivedate=3 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ultra Sun'' and ''Ultra Moon'' introduce new Ultra Beasts: Stakataka, Blacephalon{{efn|Stakataka only appears in ''Ultra Moon'' while Blacephalon only appears in ''Ultra Sun''}} and Poipole (which evolves into Naganadel).&lt;ref name="fo"/&gt; In addition, there are new forms for the [[Legendary Pokémon]] [[Necrozma]], dubbed "Dusk Mane" and "Dawn Wings" forms, which are achieved by absorbing Legendary Pokémon [[Solgaleo]] and [[Lunala]], respectively (similar to Black/White Kyurem from ''Black 2'' and ''White 2'' and Lusamine's mutated form from the original ''Sun'' and ''Moon''). These forms act as cover mascots for the games. Also, a new Lycanroc form, Dusk Lycanroc, is added. Players can now travel around the Alola Region to collect Totem Stickers, which allow the player to receive a Totem Pokemon. Three new activities are added: Mantine Surf, which allows the player to surf across the region's seas; Alola Photo Club, which allows the player to take pictures of their player character with Pokémon in various poses; and Ultra Warp Ride, which allows the player to travel through varying Ultra Wormholes and encounter Ultra Beasts in their own worlds, as well as finding Legendary Pokémon from every game in the Pokémon franchise, and an increased chance for shiny pokemon to appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Valens|first1=Ana|title=Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon trailer shows off new features|url=https://dotesports.com/general/pokemon-ultra-sun-moon-trailer-17558|accessdate=23 September 2017|work=Dot Esports|date=22 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027074550/https://dotesports.com/general/pokemon-ultra-sun-moon-trailer-17558|archivedate=27 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mewtwo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoffer|first1=Christian|title=Mewtwo is Catchable in Pokemon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, Other Details Revealed|url=http://comicbook.com/gaming/2017/10/17/pokemon-ultra-sun-ultra-moon-story-details-legendaries/|accessdate=30 October 2017|work=WWG|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022233842/http://comicbook.com/gaming/2017/10/17/pokemon-ultra-sun-ultra-moon-story-details-legendaries/|archivedate=22 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Z-Moves are available for multiple Pokémon, including [[Solgaleo]], [[Lunala]], [[Lycanroc]] and [[Mimikyu]] and [[Necrozma]].&lt;ref name="rdex"/&gt; A new upgrade to the [[Rotom]] Pokédex adds Roto-Loto, which allows the player to use boosts (akin to O-Powers from the previous generation), and Z-Rotom Power, which allows the player to use Z-Moves a maximum of twice per battle.&lt;ref name="rdex"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knezevic|first1=Kevin|title=Pokemon Ultra Sun And Moon Let You Use Two Z-Moves Per Battle|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-ultra-sun-and-moon-let-you-use-two-z-moves/1100-6454011/|accessdate=30 October 2017|work=GameSpot|date=12 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107021829/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-ultra-sun-and-moon-let-you-use-two-z-moves/1100-6454011/|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plot===
{{see also|Pokémon Sun and Moon#Plot}}
Similar to ''Sun'' and ''Moon'', the player character is an eleven-year-old moving to Melemele Island in Alola with their mother. During their travels in Alola following the region's traditional island challenges, they complete trials which involve battles with powerful Pokémon (known as Totem Pokémon) and have numerous encounters with a villainous group known as Team Skull (led by a man named Guzma), a more charitable one known as the Aether Foundation (led by a woman named Lusamine), and a group called the Ultra Recon Squad, who came from a different dimension, the Ultra Megalopolis, where Necrozma has stolen its light. Much of the story revolves around two Legendary Pokémon: a Cosmog, nicknamed Nebby, who evolves into a Solgaleo (in ''Ultra Sun'') or Lunala (in ''Ultra Moon''); and Necrozma, who attempts to seize the light from Alola.

During the climax, Lusamine uses Nebby to create a wormhole to the Ultra Megalopolis, where she and Guzma attempt to fight Necrozma for the sake of the Ultra Recon Squad. However, they fail and are thrown back into their dimension later on in the story, with Necrozma following them. Necrozma fights Nebby, now a Solgaleo in Ultra Sun or Lunala in Ultra Moon, and wins. Necrozma then absorbs the Legendary Pokémon, becoming its Dusk Mane or Dawn Wings forms in the respective versions, and unleashes the Ultra Beasts upon Alola before fighting the player. After the player defeats it, Necrozma escapes into the Ultra Megalopolis, taking the world's light with it while the player, with the help of the Ultra Recon Squad, travels on a Lunala in Ultra Sun or Solgaleo in Ultra Moon through Ultra Space to reach the Ultra Megalopolis. There, the player battles Necrozma, this time in its true form (Ultra Necrozma), for the fate of the world and to rescue Nebby. The player defeats it once more, bringing light back to Alola.

As with traditional Pokémon games, the player has rivals: Hau, a friendly boy who joins the player during his journey, and Gladion, the estranged son of Lusamine. After completing these trials, the player proceeds to battle a newly established Elite Four and later defeats Hau to become Alola's first Pokémon League Champion.

In the post-game, the player encounters Team Rainbow Rocket, a dimensionally displaced group based on [[Team Rocket]] from [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Red,'' ''Blue'']], and [[Pokémon Yellow|''Yellow'']]. The aforementioned group seizes control of the Aether Foundation's headquarters and takes Lusamine hostage. The player stages a counterattack alongside a reformed Guzma, Lillie (who had been Nebby's caretaker before its evolution), and former Team Plasma leader Colress. Battling through villainous team leaders from the past games (Maxie and Archie from [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Ruby'', ''Sapphire'']], and [[Pokémon Emerald|''Emerald'']]; Cyrus from [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'', ''Pearl'']], and [[Pokémon Platinum|''Platinum'']], Lysandre from [[Pokémon X and Y|''X'' and ''Y'']], and Ghetsis from [[Pokémon Black and White|''Black'', ''White'']], [[Pokémon Black 2 and White 2|''Black 2'', and ''White 2'']]), the player finally encounters Giovanni, who leads Team Rainbow Rocket and has a [[Mewtwo]] at his disposal. After the player's victory, Giovanni vanishes, wondering "what new world shall [he] unleash [his] evil schemes upon".

Shigeru Ohmori, one of the game's producers, stated that ''Ultra Sun'' and ''Ultra Moon'' were worked on by younger staff members while veterans worked on the upcoming ''Pokémon'' game for the [[Nintendo Switch]], although some more experienced members, such as [[Shigeki Morimoto]] were assigned to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dayus|first1=Oscar|title=Pokemon For Switch Is Helped By Ultra Sun And Moon, Says Dev|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-for-switch-is-helped-by-ultra-sun-and-moon/1100-6454169/|accessdate=23 October 2017|work=GameSpot|date=20 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020205946/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-for-switch-is-helped-by-ultra-sun-and-moon/1100-6454169/|archivedate=20 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that [[Game Freak]] was treating ''Ultra Sun'' and ''Ultra Moon'' as the "culmination of our work with the 3DS system". The development team of 80 was approximately half that of [[Pokémon Sun and Moon|''Pokémon Sun'' and ''Moon'']] despite ''Ultra Sun'' and ''Ultra Moon'' having a script twice as long as ''Sun'' and ''Moon''.&lt;ref name="last"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Skrebels|first1=Joe|title=Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon Will Be the Last Pokemon RPGs for 3DS|url=http://ign.com/articles/2017/10/19/ultra-sun-and-ultra-moon-will-be-the-last-pokemon-rpgs-for-3ds|accessdate=23 October 2017|work=IGN|date=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201040246/http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/19/ultra-sun-and-ultra-moon-will-be-the-last-pokemon-rpgs-for-3ds|archivedate=1 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mewtwo" /&gt; In a separate interview, Ohmori also described an idea to develop the ''Ultra'' installments formed late during the development of ''Sun and Moon'', with the titles intended to take advantage of the momentum gained by the [[Pokémon]] series following the massively successful release of the mobile game ''[[Pokémon Go]]''. Game director Kazumasa Iwao was in charge of the battle systems in ''Sun'' and ''Moon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Webster|first1=Andrew|title=How Pokémon Go helped shape the upcoming Ultra Sun and Moon on Nintendo 3DS|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16466536/pokemon-ultra-sun-moon-interview-nintendo|accessdate=2 November 2017|work=The Verge|date=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107013501/https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16466536/pokemon-ultra-sun-moon-interview-nintendo|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-game, the game included a tribute to former Nintendo CEO [[Satoru Iwata]], mentioning his part in the development of [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Gold'' and ''Silver'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Osborn|first1=Alex|title=Pokemon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon Hide a Lovely Satoru Iwata Reference|url=http://ign.com/articles/2017/11/23/pokemon-ultra-sun-and-ultra-moon-hide-a-lovely-satoru-iwata-reference|accessdate=2 January 2018|work=IGN|date=23 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103074408/http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/11/23/pokemon-ultra-sun-and-ultra-moon-hide-a-lovely-satoru-iwata-reference|archivedate=3 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game received its first patch in December 2017, fixing several bugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoffer|first1=Christian|title=Pokemon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon Gets an Update to Fix Bugs|url=http://comicbook.com/gaming/2017/12/08/pokemon-ultra-sun-ultra-moon-update/|accessdate=2 January 2018|work=WWG|date=8 December 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103072825/http://comicbook.com/gaming/2017/12/08/pokemon-ultra-sun-ultra-moon-update/|archivedate=3 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion and release==
''Ultra Sun'' and ''Ultra Moon'' were revealed in a [[Nintendo Direct|Pokémon Direct]] on 6 June 2017. Initial clerical errors in the Pokémon website showed that the games' release date for the [[Nintendo Switch]] were "TBA", although [[The Pokémon Company]] later clarified that the games were exclusive to the [[Nintendo 3DS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hernandez|first1=Patricia|title=Pokémon Ultra Sun and Moon Only Announced For 3DS Later This Year [Update]|url=https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ultra-sun-and-moon-coming-only-to-3ds-later-thi-1795847363|accessdate=28 November 2017|work=Kotaku|date=6 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125050155/https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ultra-sun-and-moon-coming-only-to-3ds-later-thi-1795847363|archivedate=25 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar with its predecessor, the game's files were leaked in the internet before its official release, allowing software pirates to play the full game and data miners to find previously unannounced information including a new form for Necrozma, a new Ultra Beast, a new Mythical Pokémon and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frank|first1=Allegra|title=Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon dataminers leak new, rare Pokémon|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/8/16623448/pokemon-ultra-sun-ultra-moon-new-legendary-pokemon-ultra-beasts|accessdate=8 November 2017|work=Polygon|date=8 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108182349/https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/8/16623448/pokemon-ultra-sun-ultra-moon-new-legendary-pokemon-ultra-beasts|archivedate=8 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than a week before the game’s release, the mobile game ''[[Pokémon Go]]'' released an update which enables its players to customize their ingame avatars in the style of player characters from ''Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon'', marking the first time the app had been used to promote a main series game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frank|first1=Allegra|title=Pokémon Go update brings a little Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon into the game|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/13/16646420/pokemon-go-update-free-costumes-ultra-sun-ultra-moon|accessdate=14 November 2017|work=Polygon|date=13 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114093517/https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/13/16646420/pokemon-go-update-free-costumes-ultra-sun-ultra-moon|archivedate=14 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ultra Sun and Moon'' received "generally favorable" reviews according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MetaSun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MetaMoon"/&gt; Casey Defreitas in her ''[[IGN]]'' review remarked that the games were "full of smart improvements".&lt;ref name="ignrev"/&gt; Other reviewers made similar points, with Kallie Plagge at ''[[GameSpot]]'' noting that despite similarities with ''Sun'' and ''Moon'', "Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon make enough changes to stand apart as the definitive version of the seventh generation games".&lt;ref name="gspot"/&gt; On the other hand, Allegra Frank of ''[[Polygon]]'' criticized that the aforementioned changes were only present at the end, with the bulk of the gameplay being the same as its predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frank|first1=Allegra|title=Are Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon worth the return trip?|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/17/16657974/pokemon-ultra-sun-and-ultra-moon-pre-review-should-i-play|accessdate=28 November 2017|work=Polygon|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=17 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202122721/https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/17/16657974/pokemon-ultra-sun-and-ultra-moon-pre-review-should-i-play|archivedate=2 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Posttraumatic stress disorder|Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]] (PTSD) is a [[cognitive disorder]], which comes about after overcoming a [[Traumatic event (psychological)|traumatic event]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Toward the Predeployment Detection of Risk for PTSD|url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.10101519|journal = American Journal of Psychiatry|date = 2011-01-01|issn = 0002-953X|pages = 9–11|volume = 168|issue = 1|doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.10101519|first = Douglas L.|last = Delahanty|pmid=21205813}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a disease, which is extremely common to those participating in a sport at an elite level.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bullying, psychiatric pathology and suicidal behavior : International Journal of Adolescent Medicine and Health|url = http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/ijamh.2013.25.issue-3/ijamh-2013-0065/ijamh-2013-0065.xml|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these athletes feel like they have come to the end of their journey as an [[athlete]], and then try and slot themselves back into mainstream society, or after they have had to overcome a large hurdle within their chosen sport. These athletes develop feelings of alienation, [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], flashbacks or [[hyperarousal]], and generally become evident after a couple of months after stopping or after the specific event has concluded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is a common sense of confusion between the difference of PTSD and a normal response to trauma. If an athlete injures himself or herself in a horrific way, it is normal for them to go through some adversity before overcoming the injury.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Early childhood factors associated with the development of post-traumatic stress disorder: results from a longitudinal birth cohort|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0033291706009019|journal = Psychological Medicine|date = 2007-02-01|issn = 1469-8978|pmc = 2254221|pmid = 17052377|pages = 181–192|volume = 37|issue = 02|doi = 10.1017/S0033291706009019|first = Karestan C.|last = Koenen|first2 = Terrie E.|last2 = Moffitt|first3 = Richie|last3 = Poulton|first4 = Judith|last4 = Martin|first5 = Avshalom|last5 = Caspi}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may develop small [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]], have bad dreams, or feel like they can't get the traumatic experience out of their mind, however, depending on the athlete’s mental ability, or how determined they are within their chosen sport, these symptoms can be lifted in time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Along with this, those athletes who are weaker mentally are the ones who tend to not be able to recover themselves and fall into the category of PTSD.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are many therapies which can help reduce ones deterioration of PTSD, some including, psychologist sessions, various medications, [[art therapy]] or social engagement etc.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== History ==

There are many sports which are fairly dangerous and involve threatening activities, especially during competition. There is always the chance of athletes getting [[injured]] while competing or during [[training]] which is exactly the reason why a [[psychologist]] would eventually encounter a patient who is a serious athlete and is in need of their assistance to [[rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitate]] their PTSD.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Citation|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDAOZqfMca4|accessdate = 2015-09-04|title = Norman Triplett and the Birth of Sport Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychology as a general occupation has dated back to times of 1878, and around 1897 the first psychologist specialising in sport was established, by the name of Dr. Norman Triplett. Ever since, sport psychologists were helping different athletes, in the mental aspect of their game, in order for them to reach their optimum potential.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

PTSD became first evident due to those individuals who suffered extremely horrible experiences from war. Society noticed that those who took part in war, or had family members who took part in war, became distant from themselves and suffered terribly and found it very difficult to cope with the tragedies. Researchers took note of this and aimed to evaluate the situation and come to a conclusion with how to rehabilitate these victims, and while doing this they determined that these people had post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = When trauma tips you over: PTSD Part 1|url = http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/allinthemind/when-trauma-tips-you-over-ptsd-part-1/3426554|website = Radio National|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after this new found disorder was established it made it far more clearer for those sport psychologists to treat their [[patient|clients]], as prior to the discovery of PTSD, sports psychologists, had to come up with alternative options to rehabilitate their clients who were experiencing PTSD. These psychologists often took their clients to play different sports, completely different from their own in aim to treat them in the most comfortable way possible.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
There are many extreme and less extreme symptoms for PTSD, some which need [[Medications|medication]] to calm them down and others which can be solved in easier ways.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Behavioral interventions for trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder.|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayrecord&amp;uid=2008-06147-001|website = APA PsycNET|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

some of these include:

- The athlete reliving [[Traumatic experience|traumatic events]], or reliving peeks of their career - these events are relived through memories taking over through strong images within nightmares. these nightmares have such strong effects that they can cause athletes to have many physical and emotional reactions, like [[sweating]], hot and cold flushes, racing heart, tightening of the chest, snowballing worries, obsessive thinking, compulsive behaviour, [[Panic attack|panic]], or [[heart palpitations]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Behavioral activation in the treatment of comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder. - Free Online Library|url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Behavioral+activation+in+the+treatment+of+comorbid+posttraumatic...-a0221920130|website = www.thefreelibrary.com|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- The athlete being more alert or annoyed - as athletes are experiencing these flashbacks, this can cause them to miss vital sleeping hours, which in turn, results in them having a lack of concentration and be irritated. Along with this athletes could also become startled easier and always be on the lookout for signs of danger.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

- Avoiding reminders of the event: the athlete, if is encountered with an injury to trigger their PTSD, they involuntary ignore and block off certain reminders of the event. These reminders could be people, activities, feelings associated with the event, or places which remind them of their accident; they do this to ensure no painful memories become stronger.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

- The athlete becomes emotionally numb: Once an athlete either retires from their sport or has a major injury, they can develop a [[lethargic]] lifestyle and lose interest in day-to-day activities, become cut off and detached from family and friends and become emotionally flat and numb.

Also, alongside these symptoms it is also very common for these specific symptoms to lead to other mental disorder such as [[Depression (clinical)|depression]], [[Alcoholism|alcohol]] and [[drug user|drug use]] and [[anxiety disorder]]s. Once an athlete reaches this stage it is then vital for them to seek assistance if they are not already doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PsycNET - Option to Buy|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;uid=2000-02835-001|website = psycnet.apa.org|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;]

- The athlete could also suffer from [[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] too much head trauma from practice and the games just like [[Kansas City Chiefs]] player [[Jovan Belcher]] who killed himself and girlfriend on December 1, 2012

== Treatment ==

There are many available ways to treat people with PTSD, with most people resulting to [[psychologist]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s as a preferred option, this is mainly because this is the most comfortable solution. Psychologists offer the option for an individual to open up, in an environment filled with positive vibes in order for them to determine the roots of their issues.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Psychological treatments for chronic post-traumatic stress disorder|url = http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/190/2/97|journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry|date = 2007-02-01|issn = 0007-1250|pmid = 17267924|pages = 97–104|volume = 190|issue = 2|doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.106.021402|first = Jonathan I.|last = Bisson|first2 = Anke|last2 = Ehlers|first3 = Rosa|last3 = Matthews|first4 = Stephen|last4 = Pilling|first5 = David|last5 = Richards|first6 = Stuart|last6 = Turner}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the option of [[art therapy]], this was created by a man called [[Adrian Hill]], in 1942 and is one of the earliest forms of treatment.  This treatment is very beneficial to those with an open mind, it involves individuals to speak to a psychologist specialising in art, and the two both either paint, sculpt or any other forms of [[art]]. Another form of treatment, is treatment through medications; these medications aim to enhance their moments of happiness and reduce their moments of stress and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = WHAT IS ART THERAPY?|url = http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:zOmJGargKM4J:www.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/9585_019726ch1.pdf+&amp;cd=8&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=au&amp;client=safari|website = webcache.googleusercontent.com|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these medications include [[fluoxetine]], [[paroxetine]], [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), [[benzodiazepine]]s and [[glucocorticoid]]s. Obviously resulting to medications is a last resort, but unfortunately this type of therapy can be the matter of rehabilitating someone, meaning that the don’t have to live with these PTSD symptoms for the remainder of their life which is not a preferred way of life.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

There are obviously many other treatment options, with [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], [[interpersonal psychotherapy]] and [[Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing]] being some of the more popular options, all these involve an individual changing the way they think about their disease and experiences in life.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Etiology ==
Athletes may sometimes hide the severity of an injury in order to continue participating in their sport.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sport psychology support to an athlete undergoing treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: A case study|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259194177_Sport_psychology_support_to_an_athlete_undergoing_treatment_for_Post-Traumatic_Stress_Disorder_A_case_study|website = ResearchGate|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mdedge.com/psychiatry/article/64764/depression/playing-through-pain-psychiatric-risks-among-athletes|title=Playing through the pain: Psychiatric risks among athletes|website=www.mdedge.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This denial of the severity of an injury could lead to an early [[retirement]] in order for the athlete to refrain from sustaining permanent physical damage. Retirement at an earlier time than expected could lead an athlete to experience feelings such as [[Social alienation|alienation]], distress or uselessness.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mental health following traumatic physical injury: An integrative literature review - Injury|url = http://www.injuryjournal.com/article/S0020-1383(12)00064-2/abstract|website = www.injuryjournal.com|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which an athlete identifies with their sport may have an impact on their emotional response to a traumatic injury. &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Individuals who identify strongly as athletes may be at increased risk for psychopathology such as depression or PTSD after sustaining an injury.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

An example of an athlete who experienced this is Tiaina Baul "Junior" Seau Jr.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
[[Junior Seau]] was an American [[National Football League draft|NFL]] player, and is a typical example{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} of an individual with PTSD. He was born on January 19, 1969 and died on May 2, 2012. Seau was a very beneficial asset to the teams that he played for; throughout his career he played for [[San Diego Chargers]] from 1990 to 2002, [[Miami Dolphins]] from 2003–2005 and [[New England Patriots]] from 2006–2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx7jMgQyBQM|accessdate = 2015-09-04|title = OTL: Mind Control -- Study of Junior Seau's Brain}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played linebacker for all three teams and had extensive experience in this role, despite many injuries throughout his career.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Suicide, Personality Alterations, and Dementia in Athletes: A Call for Change and Reform|url = http://www.experts.com/Articles/Athletes-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-Suicide-Personality-Alterations-Dementia-Call-for-Change-By-Michael-Perrotti|website = www.experts.com|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his career at the NFL he developed differences in his personality, due to brain injury; these changes consisted of impaired self-control and regulation, sensitive emotionally and also he was not able to socialise as he once was able to, which then led to alienation, something which was a strong opposite to his original personality. From there he developed [[insomnia]] and committed suicide via a self-inflicted gunshot to his heart.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

He produced numerous paintings and drawings of [[London]]'s topography during the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Gallery1951"&gt;{{cite book|title=London Pictures: A Selection of Paintings from the Permanent Collection of the Corporation of London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9gNNAAAAYAAJ|year=1951|publisher=[[Guildhall Art Gallery]]|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Canterbury]] in 1781&lt;ref name="Harleian" /&gt; as the second son of [[Jacob Schnebbelie]], a [[Confectionery|confectioner]] who later became a noted antiquarian draughtsman employed by the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]].&lt;ref name="Nichols" /&gt;

When Jacob died at the age of only 31, leaving his family in poverty, Robert took up his father's profession and continued his work drawing old buildings in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Landscapes of Retrospection: The Magoon Collection of British Drawings and Prints, 1739-1860|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cnzqAAAAMAAJ|year=1999|publisher=[[Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center]], [[Vassar College]]|isbn=978-0-9644263-3-7|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; He displayed artistic talent from an early age; in 1795 his mother Caroline wrote to [[John Bowyer Nichols]], one of the editors of the ''[[Gentleman's Magazine]]'' and a benefactor of the family following Jacob's untimely death, to say that she was "taking the liberty of sending you my son, Robert with a few Sketches of his own performance for your inspection".

The adult Schnebbelie occasionally exhibited works at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] between 1803 and 1821. Engravings based on his drawings were widely published; he made the drawings for many of the plates in [[Robert Wilkinson (cartographer)|Robert Wilkinson]]'s ''Londina Illustrata'' (1808–1825), David Hughson's ''Description of London'' and the ''Gentleman's Magazine'', among others.&lt;ref name=DNB00&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle =Schnebbelie, Jacob|first =Freeman Marius |last = O'Donoghue |volume = 49|quote=''sources:'' [''Gent.

Schnebbelie was described posthumously by John Bowyer Nichols as being "of rather weak intellect, and very capricious in the employment of his time." The death of his mother was said to have affected him to the point that he was "scarcely able to take care of himself."&lt;ref name="Nichols" /&gt; He died in a state of acute poverty in [[Camden Town]] in 1847.&lt;ref name="MoL" /&gt; Nichols wrote that "to the horror of his few friends, his body was found in a lodging, almost destitute of furniture, after having been some days dead; and it was too evident that his death was hastened by privation."&lt;ref name="Nichols"&gt;{{cite book|title=Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century: Consisting of Authentic Memoirs and Original Letters of Eminent Persons; and Intended as a Sequel to the Literary Anecdotes |volume=VIII|last=Nichols|first=John Bowyer|authorlink=John Bowyer Nichols|publisher=J.B.

The '''Space Mirror Memorial''', which forms part of the larger '''Astronauts Memorial''', is a [[National Memorial]] on the grounds of the [[John F. Kennedy Space Center]] Visitor Complex on [[Merritt Island, Florida]].  It is maintained by the Astronauts Memorial Foundation, whose offices are located in the NASA Center for Space Education next door to the Visitor Complex. The memorial was designed in 1987 by Holt Hinshaw Pfau Jones, and dedicated on May 9, 1991, to remember the lives of the men and women who have died in the various space programs of the [[United States]], particularly those of [[NASA]]. The Astronauts Memorial has been designated by the [[U.S. Congress]] "as the national memorial to astronauts who die in the line of duty" (Joint Resolution 214, 1991).

In addition to 20 NASA career [[astronaut]]s, the memorial includes the names of a [[U.S. Air Force]] [[X-15]] test pilot, a U.S. Air Force officer who died while training for a then-classified military space program, a civilian [[spaceflight participant]] who died in the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]], and an Israeli astronaut who was killed in the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]].

==Memorial elements==
[[Image:space mirror sts107.jpg|right|thumb|Two panels show the names of the crew of [[STS-107]]'s [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']]]]
The primary feature of the memorial is the Space Mirror, a flat expanse of polished black granite, 42.5 feet high by 50 feet wide, divided into 90 smaller panels. The names of the 24 astronauts who have died are scattered over the mirror, with names of astronauts who died in the same incident grouped on the same panel, or pairs of adjacent panels. The names are cut completely through the surface, exposing a translucent backing, and filled with translucent acrylic, which is then backlit with a combination of reflected sunlight (when available) and floodlights, causing the names to glow, and appear to float in a reflection of the sky.

Near the Space Mirror is a granite wall, bearing pictures and brief biographies of those listed on the Mirror. The Space Mirror Memorial was designed by Wes Jones of Holt Hinshaw Pfau Jones and was commissioned after he won an international design competition.

===Defunct sun tracking mechanism ===
The memorial as built incorporated motors and [[jackscrew]]s to constantly track the sun across the sky in both pan and tilt axes.  Parabolic reflectors on the back side of the mirror would then direct the sunlight through the acrylic panels to brilliantly illuminate the honorees' names with sunlight.  Supplemental floodlights were used when the sun was inadequate.

In 1997, the tracking system failed, allowing part of the monument to strike a steel beam on an adjacent platform.  Insurance paid US$375,000 for repair work, but later, the mechanism again ground to a halt, due to further problems with the slewing ring.&lt;ref name="flatoday"&gt;Ash, J.: "Memorial Repairs Delayed Indefinitely", ''Florida Today'', January 23, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimated repairs were on the order of US$700,000, and the Astronauts Memorial Foundation unanimously decided the money would be better spent on educational programs instead. The floodlights were repositioned and are kept burning 24 hours a day to illuminate the memorial.&lt;ref name="flatoday"/&gt;

==Memorial funding==
The Space Mirror Memorial was to be partially funded by the sales of "[[Space Shots (trading cards)|Space Shots]]" trading cards. An agreement for 25% of Space Shots profits, in exchange for guaranteeing a $160,000 loan.&lt;ref name=LAtimes1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clary|first1=Mike|title=As the Space Mirror turns, focus is on funds : Amid structural problems at the Astronauts Memorial, a probe of its financing is launched.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-19/news/mn-633_1_space-mirror|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A projected $400,000 was owed to the Foundation, which was never paid.&lt;ref name=Ocala1&gt;{{cite web|title=Auditors tracking Challenger tag funds|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19940125&amp;id=PW9RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7QcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6865,3269625&amp;hl=en|website=Ocala Star-Banner|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Space Mirror Memorial and the Astronauts Memorial Foundation are funded in part by a specialty [[vehicle registration plate]] issued by the state of [[Florida]].  Called the ''Challenger'' plate, it was first issued in 1987, and was the first specialty plate issued by the state.  The third edition, introduced in 2004, includes ''Columbia'' in the text, and is now termed the ''Challenger/Columbia'' plate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flhsmv.gov/dmv/specialtytags/miscellaneous/challenger_columbia.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
The memorial cost US$6.2 million.&lt;ref name="flatoday"/&gt; License plates brought in $377,000 in 2009.&lt;ref name="ft101121"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Jeff |last=Schweers |title=Space nonprofit CEOs pay unusually high |url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20101121/NEWS01/11210334/Space-nonprofit-CEO-s-pay-unusually-high |publisher=Florida Today |location=Melbourne, Florida |pages=1A |date=21 November 2010 |id= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124025510/http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20101121/NEWS01/11210334/Space-nonprofit-CEO-s-pay-unusually-high |archivedate=November 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honorees ==
Only those killed during [[human spaceflight]] missions or during training for such missions sponsored by the United States are eligible for inclusion in the memorial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amfcse.org/Default.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; For a comprehensive list of space disasters, see [[List of space disasters]].

The people honored on the memorial are:

*[[Theodore Freeman]], one of the "[[Astronaut Group 3]]" recruits from 1963, died in a [[T-38 Talon|T-38]] training accident on October 31, 1964.
*[[Elliot See]] and [[Charles Bassett]] were killed in a [[1966 NASA T-38 crash|T-38 accident]] on February 28, 1966, when their aircraft crashed into McDonnell Building 101 on a foggy day.  They were originally slated to be the crew of [[Gemini 9]].  Bassett was another Group 3 recruit, whereas See was an [[Astronaut Group 2]] recruit from 1962.
*[[Gus Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[Roger Chaffee]] were in the [[Apollo 1]] capsule for [[Apollo 1#Plugs-out test|plugs-out test]] on January 27, 1967, when a short circuit ignited flammable materials in the pressurized pure-oxygen atmosphere.  The astronauts died of carbon monoxide poisoning before ground crews could reach them.  Grissom, one of the "[[Mercury Seven]]" astronauts, had flown twice before.  White conducted the first US [[spacewalk]] on [[Gemini 4]].  Chaffee, a rookie, was a Group 3 recruit.
*[[Clifton Williams]] died in a T-38 training crash on October 5, 1967.  Another Group 3 recruit, he was in the Apollo astronaut rotation, and would have been on the crew of [[Apollo 12]].  He was also memorialized by a fourth star on the official Apollo 12 mission badge.
*[[Michael J. Adams]] died in an [[X-15]] crash on November 15, 1967.  He was not a NASA astronaut recruit, but made the memorial by virtue of having earned the [[Astronaut Badge]] according to the [[USAF]] standard by reaching just over [[Kármán line#Controversy|50 miles in altitude]] on his fatal flight.  He was also in the [[United States Air Force]]'s [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] program.
*[[Robert Henry Lawrence Jr.|Robert H. Lawrence Jr.]], died on December 8, 1967, when the [[F-104]] he was an instructor pilot for a flight test trainee crashed and his ejection seat parachute failed to open.  He was in the [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] program at the time, and could have been among the first African-American astronauts had he survived to take NASA's offer for all under-35 MOL candidates to join their space program when MOL was scrapped in 1969.
*On January 28, 1986, the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] broke apart 73 seconds after liftoff on mission [[STS-51-L]] due to a defect in one of the solid rocket boosters.  All seven crew members—[[Dick Scobee|Francis "Dick" Scobee]], [[Michael J. Smith (astronaut)|Michael J. Smith]], [[Ronald McNair]], [[Gregory Jarvis]], [[Judith Resnik]], [[Ellison Onizuka]], and [[Christa McAuliffe]]—died.  Scobee, McNair, Resnik, and Onizuka had flown before.  McAuliffe was participating via the [[Teacher in Space Project]].
*[[Sonny Carter|M. L. "Sonny" Carter]] died on April 5, 1991, in the crash of [[Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 2311]]. Carter was a passenger traveling on NASA business.  He had flown on [[STS-33]] and was in training for [[STS-42]] at the time.
*On February 1, 2003, the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] disintegrated on re-entry at the end of mission [[STS-107]] due to damage during ascent.  The crew was [[Rick Husband]], [[William C. McCool]], [[David M. Brown]], [[Kalpana Chawla]], [[Michael P. Anderson]], [[Laurel Clark]] and [[Ilan Ramon]].  Husband, Chawla and Anderson were veterans. Ramon was a pilot in the [[Israeli Air Force]].

==Astronauts Memorial Foundation==
The president of the Astronaut Memorial Foundation was [[Stephen Feldman]] from 1999 to 2012. He was paid $303,000 annually. This was criticized as being the highest among 100 of Brevard County non-profits. His salary represented 18.3 percent of the fund's $1.8 million budget in fiscal year 2009. He defended his salary by saying that he was the sole fundraiser and the chief financial officer for the foundation.&lt;ref name="ft101121"/&gt;

[[Thad Altman]] became President and CEO of the Astronauts Memorial Foundation in August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astronautsmemorial.org/uploads/2/1/4/4/21442530/amf_president_named.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Board of Directors include Eileen Collins - Chairman, Jack Kirschenbaum - Vice Chairman, Gregory H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1561">The '''Spoliation Advisory Panel''' advises the United Kingdom Government on claims for cultural property looted during the Nazi era. 

The Panel is designated by the Secretary of State under Section 3 of the [[Holocaust (Return of Cultural Objects) Act 2009]] to advise on claims made by former owners or their heirs (or in some cases, states or public bodies) for the return of, or compensation for the loss of, items that have come into the effective possession of institutions in the UK, for example artworks in the national collections. It deals with cases where the objects were allegedly lost through seizure or forced sales during the Nazi era, or through looting or other unlawful transactions during the Second World War. It provides non-binding recommendations for return or for [[ex gratia]] payments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lootedart.com/MFEU4P88744_print;Y LootedArt.com description of Panel]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Panel was established in February 2000 by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport as an advisory [[non-departmental public body]] under the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] (DCMS). It was chaired by Sir [[David Hirst (judge)|David Hirst]] until April 2010, when it was reconstituted as a group of expert advisers and Sir [[Donnell Deeny]], a member from the outset, took over as chairman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/cultural_property/3296.aspx/ Spoliation Advisory Panel home page], DCMS website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Family of Man''''' was an ambitious&lt;ref&gt;The Family of Man is "one of the most ambitious and challenging projects, photography has ever attempted. It was conceived as a mirror of the universal elements and cmotions in the everydayness of life and demonstrates that the art of photography is a dynamic process of giving form to ideas and of explaining man to man". Steichen quoted in {{Citation | author1=United States. American Embassy.

It was first shown in 1955 from January 24 to May 8 at the New York MoMA, then toured the world for eight years to record-breaking audience numbers.

According to Steichen, the exhibition represented the "culmination of his career."&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Modern Art, New York.

More than 9 million people viewed the exhibit, which is still in excess of the audience for any photographic exhibition since.The photographs included in the exhibition, which is still on display, focus on the commonalities that bind people and cultures around the world and the exhibition itself served as an expression of [[Humanist photography|humanism]] in the decade following World War II.&lt;ref name="MoMa Archives"&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Steichen at The Family of Man, 1955|url=http://www.moma.org/learn/resources/archives/archives_highlights_06_1955|publisher=MoMA|accessdate=15 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125045308/http://www.moma.org/learn/resources/archives/archives_highlights_06_1955|archivedate=25 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recently-formed [[United States Information Agency]] was instrumental in touring the photographs throughout the world in five different versions for seven years, under the auspices of the Museum of Modern Art International Program.&lt;ref&gt;founded in 1952 to develop and tour circulating exhibitions, including United States Representations at international exhibitions and festivals, one-person shows, and group exhibitions.

}}'''Copy 5:''' Following a bilateral agreement between the USA and USSR, in 1959 the American National Exhibition was to be held in Moscow and the Russians were to have the use of New York City's [[New York Coliseum|Coliseum]]. This Moscow trade fair at [[Sokolniki Park]] was the scene of Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and United States Vice President [[Richard Nixon]]'s '[[Kitchen Debate]]' over the relative merits of communism and capitalism. ''The Family of Man'' was a late inclusion not originally envisaged in MoMA's itinerary. With a grant to the Museum of $15,000 (less than half of what it requested) and funding from the plastics industry for the radical pre-fabricated translucent pavilion design to house it, a fifth copy of the show was salvaged from what was left from Beruit and Scandinavia showings, augmented with new prints.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Moscow, in the context of a trade show 'supermarket' meant to demonstrate lavish [[consumerism]], and a [[multimedia]] display assembled by [[Charles and Ray Eames|Charles Eames]], the collection's overtones of peace and human brotherhood symbolized a lifting of the overhanging danger of an [[Nuclear warfare|atomic war]] for [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] citizens in the midst of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name="White 1959"&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Ralph K.|date=Winter 1959|title=Reactions to Our Moscow Exhibit: Voting Machines and Comment Books|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|series=4|volume=23|pages=461–470|doi=10.1086/266900}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This meaning seemed to be grasped especially by Russian students and intellectuals.&lt;ref name="White 1959" /&gt; Recognising the importance of the Moscow exhibition as "the high spot of the project"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/953971378|title=Steichen : a life in photography|last=Edward.|first=Steichen,|isbn=9781135462840|oclc=953971378}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steichen attended its opening and made copious photographs of the event.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==An innovative exhibit==
The physical installation and layout of the Family of Man exhibition aimed to enable the visitor to read this as a [[photo-essay]]&lt;ref name="Turner, Fred 2012"&gt;Turner, Fred (2012) 'The Family of Man and the Politics of Attention in Cold War America' in Public Culture 24:1 Duke University Press. {{DOI|10.1215/08992363-1443556}}&lt;/ref&gt; about human development and cycles of life affirming a common human identity and destiny against the contemporary [[Cold War]] threats of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]].

Architect [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]] designed a series of temporary walls among the existing structural columns&lt;ref&gt;"Family of Man, Exhibition Installation at Museum of Modern Art by Paul Rudolph". ''Interiors'' (April 1955): 114-17.&lt;/ref&gt; guiding visitors past the images,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2004675273/|title=Family of Man exhibit, Museum of Modern Art, New York City.

(1998).  The power of display : a history of exhibition installations at the Museum of Modern Art. MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts p.240&lt;/ref&gt; encouraging them to pause at those which attracted their attention. HIs layout was accommodated as closely as possible, using his display features, in the international venues which varied considerably from the original space at MoMA.

Open spaces within the layout required viewers to make their own decisions about their passage through the exhibition, and to gather to discuss it. The layout and placement of prints and their variation in size encouraged the bodily participation of the audience, who would have to bend to examine a small print displayed below eye level and then to step back to view a mural image, and to negotiate both narrow and expansive spaces.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The prints range in size from 24 x 36&amp;nbsp;cm to 300 x 400&amp;nbsp;cm and were made by his assistant Jack Jackson,&lt;ref&gt;Osman, C. (1991). LETTERS. ''The British Journal of Photography'', 139(6831), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of the contemporary images, from the negative supplied to Steichen by each photographer. Also included were copies of historical images including a [[Mathew Brady|Matthew Brady]] civil war documentation and a [[Lewis Carroll]] portrait.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Blown-up, often mural scale images, angled, floated or curved, some inset into other floor-to-ceiling prints, even displayed on the ceiling (a canted view of a silhouetted axeman and tree), on posts like finger-boards (in the final room), and the floor (for a [[Ring a Ring o' Roses|Ring o' Roses]] series), were grouped together according to diverse themes. Repeated prints of Eugene Harris' portrait of a Peruvian flute-player forming a coda, or acting as 'Pied Piper' to the audience in the opinion of some reviewers,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Katherine Hoffman (2005) Sowing the seeds/setting the stage: Steichen, Stieglitz and The Family of Man , History of Photography, 29:4, 320-330, DOI: 10.1080/03087298.2005.10442814&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sollors, Werner (2018) "''The Family of Man'': Looking at the Photographs Now and Remembering a Visit in the 1950s" in {{Citation | author1=Hurm, Gerd, 1958-, (editor.) | author2=Reitz, Anke, (editor.) | author3=Zamir, Shamoon, (editor.) | title=The family of man revisited : photography in a global age | publication-date=2018 | publisher=London I.B.Tauris | isbn=978-1-78672-297-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to Steichen himself, expressing "a little bit of mischief, but much sweetness—that's the song of life."&lt;ref&gt;'Portfolio', 357, Eric J. Sandeen, 'The International Reception of ''The Family of Man, History of Photography'' 29, no. 4, (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Lighting intensities varied throughout the series of ten rooms in order to set the mood.

The exhibition opened with an entrance archway papered with a blow-up of a crowd in London by Pat English framing [[Wynn Bullock|Wyn Bullock]]'s Chinese landscape of sunlight on water into which was inset an image of a truncated nude of a pregnant woman in an evocation of [[creation myth]]s. Subjects then ranged in sequence from lovers, to childbirth, to household, and careers, then to death and on a topical portentous note, the hydrogen bomb (an image from LIFE magazine of the test detonation ''Mike,'' [[Operation Ivy]], [[Enewetak Atoll]], October 31, 1952) which was the only full-colour image; a room-filling backlit 1.8m x 2.43m Eastman [[Reversal film|transparency]], replaced for the travelling version of the show with a different view of the same explosion in black and white.

Finally, full cycle, visitors returned once more to children in a room in which the last picture was [[W. Eugene Smith]]'s iconic 1946 ''A Walk to Paradise Garden''. As the centrepiece of the exhibition a hanging sculptural installation of photographs including Vito Fiorenza's [[Sicily|Sicilian]] family group and [[Carl Mydans]]' of a Japanese family (both from nations which were recent enemies of the Allies in WW2), another from [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland]] by [[Nat Farbman]] and a rural family of the United States by [[Nina Leen]], encouraged circulation to view double-sided prints and invited reflection on the universal nature of the family beyond cultural differences.

Photos were chosen according to their capacity to communicate a story, or a feeling, that contributed to the overarching [[narrative]]. Each grouping of images builds upon the next, creating an intricate story of human life. The design of the exhibition built on trade displays and Steichen's 1945 ''Power In The Pacific'' exhibition which was designed by [[G. E. Kidder Smith|George Kidder Smith]] for MoMA, Steichen's commissioning of [[Herbert Bayer]] for the presentation of his curatorship of other exhibitions and his own long history of initiation of innovative exhibits dating back to his association with [[291 (art gallery)|Gallery 291]] early in the century.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph L. Harley, Jr., 'Edward Steichen's Modernist Art-Space', ''History ofPhotography'' 14:1 (Spring 1990), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 Steichen elaborated on the special opportunities offered by the exhibition format;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the cinema and television, the image is revealed at a pace set by the director. In the exhibition gallery, the visitor sets his own pace. He can go forward and then retreat or hurry along according to his own impulse and mood as these are stimulated by the exhibition. In the creation of such an exhibition, resources are brought into play that are not available elsewhere. The contrast in scale of images, the shifting of focal points, the intriguing perspective of long- and short- range visibility with the images to come being glimpsed beyond the images at hand —all these permit the spectator an active participation that no other form of visual communication can give.&lt;ref&gt;Steichen, E. (1963). ''A life in photography''. Garden City, N.Y: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Texts used in the exhibition and book ==
The enlarged prints by the multiple photographers were displayed without explanatory captions, and instead were intermingled with quotations by, among others, [[James Joyce]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Lillian Smith (author)|Lillian Smith]], and [[William Shakespeare]], chosen by photographer and social activist [[Dorothy Norman]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation | author1=Hurm, Gerd, 1958-, (editor.) | author2=Reitz, Anke, (editor.) | author3=Zamir, Shamoon, (editor.) | title=The family of man revisited : photography in a global age | publication-date=2018 | publisher=London I.B.Tauris | isbn=978-1-78672-297-3 | page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Sandburg]], Steichen's brother-in-law, 1951 recipient of the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] and known for his biography of [[Abraham Lincoln]], wrote an accompanying poetic commentary also displayed as text panels throughout the exhibition and included in the publication, of which the following are a sample;

{{quote|There is only one man in the world and his name is All Men. There is only one woman in the world and her name is All Women. There is only one child in the world and the child's name is All Children.

People! flung wide and far, born into toil, struggle, blood and dreams, among lovers, eaters, drinkers, workers, loafers, fighters, players, gamblers. Here are ironworkers, bridge men, musicians, sandhogs, miners, builders of huts and skyscrapers, jungle hunters, landlords, and the landless, the loved and the unloved, the lonely and abandoned, the brutal and the compassionate — one big family hugging close to the ball of Earth for its life and being. Everywhere is love and love-making, weddings and babies from generation to generation keeping the Family of Man alive and continuing.

If the human face is "the masterpiece of God" it is here then in a thousand fateful registrations. Often the faces speak that words can never say. Some tell of eternity and others only the latest tattings. Child faces of blossom smiles or mouths of hunger are followed by homely faces of majesty carved and worn by love, prayer and hope, along with others light and carefree as thistledown in a late summer wing. Faces have land and sea on them, faces honest as the morning sun flooding a clean kitchen with light, faces crooked and lost and wondering where to go this afternoon or tomorrow morning. Faces in crowds, laughing and windblown leaf faces, profiles in an instant of agony, mouths in a dumbshow mockery lacking speech, faces of music in gay song or a twist of pain, a hate ready to kill, or calm and ready-for-death faces. Some of them are worth a long look now and deep contemplation later.}}

==A popular publication==
Jerry Mason (1914–1991) contemporaneously edited and published a complimentary book&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author1=Steichen, Edward | author2=Steichen, Edward, 1879-1973, (organizer.) | author3=Sandburg, Carl, 1878-1967, (writer of foreword.) | author4=Norman, Dorothy, 1905-1997, (writer of added text.) | author5=Lionni, Leo, 1910-1999, (book designer.) | author6=Mason, Jerry, (editor.) | author7=Stoller, Ezra, (photographer.) | author8=Museum of Modern Art (New York, N.Y.) | title=The family of man : the photographic exhibition | publication-date=1955 | publisher=Published for the Museum of Modern Art by Simon and Schuster in collaboration with the Maco Magazine Corporation | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/10809600 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the exhibition through Ridge Press,&lt;ref&gt;Parr, Martin &amp; Badger, Gerry (2006).

The pivot of the world : photography and its nation. MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1950s, and reprinted in large format for its 40th anniversary, and in its various editions has sold more than four million copies. Most images from the exhibition were reproduced with an introduction by [[Carl Sandburg]], whose prologue reads, in part:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first cry of a baby in Chicago, or Zamboango, in Amsterdam or Rangoon, has the same pitch and key, each saying, "I am! I have come through! I belong! I am a member of the Family. Many the babies and grownup here from photographs made in sixty-eight nations round our planet Earth. You travel and see what the camera saw. The wonder of human mind, heart wit and instinct is here. You might catch yourself saying, 'I'm not a stranger here.' &lt;ref&gt;Museum of Modern Art, New York. The Family of Man: The greatest photographic exhibition of all time—503 pictures from 68 countries—created by Edward Steichen for the Museum of Modern Art. New York, Maco Magazine Corporation, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, an omission from the book, highly significant and contrary to Steichen's stated pacifist aim, was the image of a hydrogen bomb test explosion; audiences of the time were highly sensitive to the threat of universal nuclear annihilation.&lt;ref&gt;Withey, S. B. 1954. Survey of Public Knowledge and Attitudes Concerning Civil Defense. Ann Arbor: Survey Research Center, Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt; In place of the huge colour transparency to which a space was devoted in the MoMA exhibition, and the black-and-white mural print that toured countries other than Japan, only this quotation of [[Bertrand Russell]]'s anti-nuclear warning, in white type on a black page, appears in the book;&lt;ref&gt;Orvell, Miles 'Et in Arcadia Ego: ''The Family of Man'' as a Cold War Pastoral' in Hurm, Gerd, 1958-, (editor.); Reitz, Anke, (editor.); Zamir, Shamoon, (editor.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] The best authorities are unanimous in saying that a war with hydrogen bombs is quite likely to put an end to the human race [...] There will be universal death — sudden for only a minority, but for the majority a slow torture of disease and disintegration.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Robert McDaniels.jpg|right|150px|Robert McDaniels, lynched April 13, 1937, in [[Duck Hill, Mississippi]]]] Absent also from the book, and removed by week eleven of the initial MoMA exhibition, was the distressing photograph of the aftermath of a [[Lynching of Roosevelt Townes and Robert McDaniels|lynching]], of a dead young African American man, tied to a tree with his bound arms tautly tethered with a rope that stretches out of frame.&lt;ref&gt;Zamir, Shamoon, 'Structures of Rhyme, Forms of Participation: ''The Family of Man'' as Exhibition', in Hurm, Gerd, 1958-, (editor.); Reitz, Anke, (editor.); Zamir, Shamoon, (editor.)

For most purchasers, this was their first encounter with a book that gave priority to the photographic image over text.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2015, to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the inaugural exhibition,  MoMA reissued the book as a hardcover edition, with the original jacket design from 1955 and [[duotone]] printing from new copies of all of the photographs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.momastore.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=10001&amp;catalogId=10451&amp;productId=217958&amp;promoCode=8H104&amp;categoryId=11486&amp;parent_category_rn=26683&amp;cm_mmc=MoMA-_-Other-_-Publications-_-NA MoMA bookshop site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225113418/https://www.momastore.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=10001&amp;catalogId=10451&amp;productId=217958&amp;promoCode=8H104&amp;categoryId=11486&amp;parent_category_rn=26683&amp;cm_mmc=MoMA-_-Other-_-Publications-_-NA |date=2016-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steichen's stated objective was to draw attention, visually, to the universality of human experience and the role of photography in its documentation. The exhibition brought together 503 photos from 68 countries, the work of 273 photographers (163 of whom were Americans)&lt;ref&gt;Jay, Bill (1989) "The Family of Man A Reappraisal of 'The Greatest Exhibition of All Time'. ''Insight'', Bristol Workshops in Photography, Rhode Island, Number 1, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; which, with 70 European photographers, means that the ensemble represents a primarily Western viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Gresh (2005) The European roots of The Family of Man, History of Photography, 29:4, 331-343, DOI: 10.1080/03087298.2005.10442815&lt;/ref&gt; That forty were women photographers can in some part be attributed to Joan Miller's contribution to the selection.

[[Dorothea Lange]] assisted her friend Edward Steichen in recruiting photographers&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Fred (2012).  'The Family of Man and the Politics of Attention in Cold War America', in Public Culture 24:1 Duke University Press {{DOI|10.1215/08992363-1443556}}&lt;/ref&gt; using her [[Farm Security Administration|FSA]] and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' connections who in turn promoted the project to their colleagues. In 1953 she circulated a letter; "A Summons to Photographers All Over the World," calling on them to;

&lt;blockquote&gt;show Man to Man across the world. Here we hope to reveal by visual images Man's dreams and aspirations, his strength, his despair under evil. If photography can bring these things to life, this exhibition will be created in a spirit of passionate and devoted faith in Man. Nothing short of that will do.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothea Lange, letter, January 16, 1953, quoted in Szarkowski, "The Family of Man," 24.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The letter then listed topics that photographs might cover and these categories are reflected in the show's final arrangement. Lange's work features in the exhibition.

Steichen and his team drew heavily on ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' archives for the photographs used in the final exhibition,&lt;ref&gt;Alise Tlfentale (2015) in Šelda Pukīte (editor) and Latvian National Museum of Art and Luxembourg National Museum of History and Art.  ''Edvards Steihens. Fotografija: Izstades katalogs (Edward Steichen. Photography:  Exhibition catalogue)''. Neputns Publishing House and Latvian National Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt; seventy-five by Abigail Solomon-Godeau's count, more than 20% of the total (111 out of 503), while some were obtained from other magazines; ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' was represented by nine, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' (7), ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'' (seven, all by Homer Page), ''[[Ladies' Home Journal|Ladies Home Journal]]'' (4); ''[[Popular Photography]]'' (3), and others ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'', ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]], [[Harper's Bazaar]], [[Time (magazine)|Time]],'' the British ''[[Picture Post]]'' and the French ''Du'', by one. From picture agencies American, Soviet, European and international, which also supplied the above magazines, came about 13% of the content, with [[Magnum Photos|Magnum]] represented by 43 of the pictures, [[Rapho (agency)|Rapho]] with thirteen, [[Black Star (photo agency)|Black Star]] with ten, [[PIX Publishing|Pix]] with seven, [[Sovfoto]], which had three and Brackman with four, with around half a dozen other agencies represented by one photo.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Citation | author1=Solomon-Godeau, Abigail | author2=Parsons, Sarah (Sarah Caitlin), 1971-, (editor.) | title=Photography after photography : gender, genre, history | publication-date=2017 | publisher=Durham Duke University Press | page=57 | isbn=978-0-8223-6266-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steichen  travelled internationally to collect images, through 11 European countries including France, Switzerland, Austria and Germany.&lt;ref name="Gresh, Kristen 2005"&gt;Gresh, Kristen. 2005. "The European Roots of 'The Family of Man' ". History of Photography 29, (4): 331-343&lt;/ref&gt; In total, Steichen procured 300 images from European photographers, many from the [[Humanist photography|humanist group]], which were first shown in the ''Post-War European Photography'' exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1953.&lt;ref name="Gresh, Kristen 2005" /&gt; Due to the incorporation of this body of work into the 1955 ''The Family of Man'' exhibition, ''Post-War European Photography'' is thought of as a preview to ''The Family of Man''.&lt;ref name="Gresh, Kristen 2005" /&gt; The international tour of the definitive 1955 exhibition was sponsored by the now defunct [[United States Information Agency]], whose aim was to counter [[Cold War]] [[propaganda]] by creating a better world image of American policies and values.&lt;ref name="Gresh, Kristen 2005" /&gt;

Though most photographers were represented by a single picture, some had several included; Robert Doisneau, Homer Page, Helen Levitt, Manuel Álvarez Bravo, Bill Brandt, Édouard Boubat, Harry Callahan (with two), Nat Farbman (five of Bechuanaland, and more from ''Life''),  Robert Frank (four), Bert Hardy and Robert Harrington (three). Steichen himself supplied five photos, while his assistant Wayne Miller had thirteen chosen; by far the greatest number.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Reception and criticism ==
Photography, said Steichen, "communicates equally to everybody throughout the world. It is the only universal language we have, the only one requiring no translation."&lt;ref&gt;Edward Steichen, "Photography: Witness and Recorder of History," Wisconsin Magazine of History 41, no. 3 (1958): 160.&lt;/ref&gt; When the exhibition opened most reviewers loved the show, embracing the idea of this 'universal language', and lauding Steichen as a sort of author and the exhibition as a text or essay. Photographer [[Barbara Morgan (photographer)|Barbara Morgan]], in [[Aperture (magazine)|Aperture]], connected this concept with the show's universalising theme;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In comprehending the show the individual himself is also enlarged, for these photographs are not photographs only — they are also phantom images of our co-citizens; this woman into whose photographic eyes I now look is perhaps today weeding her family rice paddy, or boiling a fish in coconut milk. Can you look at the polygamist family group and imagine the different norms that make them live happily in their society which is so unlike — yet like — our own? Empathy with these hundreds of human beings truly expands our sense of values.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Morgan, "The Theme Show: A Contemporary Exhibition Technique," in n.a., "The Controversial Family of Man," Aperture 3, no. 2 (1955)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Roland Barthes]] however was quick to criticise the exhibition as being an example of his concept of myth - the dramatization of an ideological message. In his book [[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]], published in France a year after the exhibition in Paris in 1956, Barthes declared it to be a product of "conventional humanism," a collection of photographs in which everyone lives and "dies in the same way everywhere ." "Just showing pictures of people being born and dying tells us, literally, nothing."&lt;ref&gt;Roland Barthes, "La grande famille des hommes" ("The Great Family of Man"), in Mythologies (Paris: Éditions du Seuil, 1957), 173–76; English translation edition: Roland Barthes, "The Great Family of Man," Mythologies, translated by Annette Lavers (St Albans, Hertfordshire: Picador, 1976), 100-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other noteworthy reactions, both positive and negative, have been proffered in social/cultural studies and as part of artistic and historical texts. The earliest critics of the show were, ironically, photographers, who felt that Steichen had downplayed individual talent and discouraged the public from accepting photography as art. The show was the subject of an entire issue of [[Aperture (magazine)|Aperture]]; "The Controversial 'Family of Man'"&lt;ref&gt;Aperture, vol. 3, no. 2, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walker Evans]] disdained its "human familyhood [and] bogus heartfeeling"&lt;ref&gt;Walker Evans, "Robert Frank," US Camera 1958 (New York: US Camera Publishing Corporation, 1957), 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Phoebe Lou Adams complained that "If Mr. Steichen's well-intentioned spell doesn't work, it can only be because he has been so intent on [Mankind's] physical similarities that...he has utterly forgotten that a family quarrel can be as fierce as any other kind."&lt;ref&gt;Phoebe Lou Adams, "Through a Lens Darkly." Atlantic Monthly, no. 195 (April 1955), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics complained that Steichen merely transposed the magazine photo-essay from page to museum wall; in 1955 Rollie McKenna likened the experience to a ride through a funhouse,&lt;ref&gt;"Good photographs speak for themselves. Steichen would be the first to agree, but somehow he and Paul Rudolf (sic), a gifted Florida architect, designed a display so elaborate that the photographs become less important than the methods of displaying them [...] Pictures of children throughout the world playing ring-around-a-rosy are contorted into trapezoids and mounted on a circular metal construction. In another instance a man is chopping wood high in a tree top. This undistinguished photograph has been mounted horizontally over the spectator's head. To see it properly he has to get in the same position as the photographer who took the picture, on his back! [...] Photographs grow from pink and lavender poles, dangle from the ceiling, lie on the floor, protrude from the wall. Some, happily, just hang. In case the point has not yet been made, toward the end of the exhibit there is a group of nine portraits arranged around---yes, a mirror. Alongside is a quote from Bertrand Russell. " ... for the majority it is a slow torture of disease and disintegration." wrote Rollie McKenna, in his review of "The Family of Man," New Republic, 14 March 1955, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Russell Lynes]] in 1973 wrote that Family of Man "was a vast photo-essay, a literary formula basically, with much of the emotional and visual quality provided by sheer bigness of the blow-ups and its rather sententious message sharpened by juxtaposition of opposites — wheat fields and landscapes of boulders, peasants and patricians, a sort of 'look at all these nice folks in all these strange places who belong to this family.'"&lt;ref&gt;Russell Lynes, Good Old Modern: An Intimate Portrait of the Museum of Modern Art (New York: Atheneum, 1973), 325.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob Deschin, photography critic for [[The New York Times]], wrote, "the show is essentially a picture story to support a concept and an editorial achievement rather than an exhibition of photography."&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Deschin quoted in {{Citation | author1=Szarkowski, John | author2=Museum of Modern Art (New York, N.Y.) | title=Mirrors and windows : American photography since 1960 | publication-date=1978 | page=16| publisher=Museum of Modern Art ; Boston : distributed by New York Graphic Society | isbn=978-0-87070-475-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an optic of struggle,&lt;ref&gt;Lopate, Phillip (2009). Notes on Sontag. Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J. ; Woodstock p.205&lt;/ref&gt; echoing Barthes, [[Susan Sontag]] in [[On Photography]] accused Steichen of sentimentalism and oversimplification: ' ... they wished, in the 1950s, to be consoled and distracted by a sentimental humanism. ... Steichen's choice of photographs assumes a human condition or a human nature shared by everybody." Directly quoting Barthes, without acknowledgement,&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; she continues; "By purporting to show that individuals are born, work, laugh, and die everywhere in the same way, "The Family of Man" denies the determining weight of history - of genuine and historically embedded differences, injustices, and conflicts.'&lt;ref&gt;Sontag, S. (1977) On Photography. Penguin (Harmondsworth), UK&lt;/ref&gt;

Others attacked the show as an attempt to paper over problems of race and class, including Christopher Phillips, [[John Berger]], and [[Abigail Solomon-Godeau]], who in her 2004 essay, while describing herself as among "those who intellectually came of age as postmodernists, poststructuralists, feminists, Marxists, antihumanists, or, for that matter, atheists, this little essay of Barthes's efficiently demonstrated the problem — indeed the bad faith — of sentimental humanism", concedes that "as photography exhibitions go, it is perhaps the ultimate "bad object" for progressives or critical theorists", but "good to think with.".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Abigail Solomon-Godeau, "'The Family of Man': Den Humanismus für ein postmodernes Zeitalter aufpolieren" ("'The Family of Man': Refurbishing Humanism for a Postmodern Age"), in "The Family of Man," 1955–2001: Humanismus und Postmoderne; eine Revision von Edward Steichens Fotoausstellung ("The Family of Man," 1955–2001: Humanism and Postmodernism; a Reappraisal of the Photo Exhibition by Edward Steichen), ed. Jean Back and Viktoria Schmidt- Linsenhoff (Marburg, Germany: Jonas, 2004), 28–55&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these critics, including Solomon-Godeau who openly admits it,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; it should be noted, had not viewed the exhibition but were working from the published catalogue which notably excludes the image of the atomic explosion.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While ''The Family of Man'' was being exhibited there at its last venue in 1959 several pictures were torn down in [[Moscow]] by the Nigerian student Theophilus Neokonkwo. An Associated Press report of the time&lt;ref&gt;"Student Arrested for Slashing Photographs in THE FAMILY OF MAN in Moscow." The Associated Press report read: “Moscow, August 6, All. A medical student from Nigeria has been arrested by Soviet Police for slashing four photographs in the U.S. Exhibition. The Nigerian was arrested Wednesday after he cut up pictures from the photographic series, 'The Family of Man’ which he clearly disliked. One picture showed an African dance. Another was a large tattooed face. A third was a hunter holding up a deer. The fourth showed African lips drinking water from a gourd. Exhibition officials withdrew the damaged pictures and said an effort will be made to restore them.”&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that his actions were in a protest at colonialist attitudes to black races&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Kaplan, Louis | title=American exposures : photography and community in the twentieth century | publication-date=2005 | publisher=University of Minnesota Press | isbn=978-0-8166-4569-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, other critics defended the exhibition, referring to the political and cultural environment in which it was staged. Among these were [[Fred Turner (author)|Fred Turner]],&lt;ref name="Turner, Fred 2012"/&gt; Eric J. Sandeen,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Eric J. Sandeen, Picturing an Exhibition: "The Family of Man" and 1950s America (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Blake Stimson&lt;ref&gt;Blake Stimson (2006), The Pivot of the World: Photography and Its Nation. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Walter L. Hixson.&lt;ref&gt;Parting the Curtain: Propaganda, Culture and the Cold War, 1945 – 1961 (St Martin's Press: New York, 1997), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, a compilation of essays&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Hurm, Gerd, 1958-, (editor.) | author2=Reitz, Anke, (editor.) | author3=Zamir, Shamoon, (editor.) | title=The family of man revisited : photography in a global age | publication-date=2018 | publisher=London I.B.Tauris | isbn=978-1-78672-297-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by contemporary critics supported by newly translated writings contemporary to the exhibition's appearances collected and edited by [[Gerd Hurm]], Anke Reitz and Shamoon Zamir presents a revised reading of Steichen's motivations and audience reactions, and a reassessment of the validity of Roland Barthes' influential criticism in "La grande famille des hommes" in his ''Mythologies''.

== Tributes, sequels and critical revisions ==

In the years since ''The Family of Man'', several exhibitions stemmed from projects directly inspired by Steichen's work and others were presented in opposition to it. Still others were alternative projects offering new thoughts on the themes and motifs presented in 1955. These serve to represent artists', photographers' and curators' responses to the exhibition beside those of the cultural critics, and to track the evolution of reactions as societies and their self-images change.

=== World Exhibition of Photography ===
[[File:Catalogue of the 1965 Weltausstellung der Fotographie (World Exhibition of Photography.jpg|thumb|Catalogue of the 1965 Weltausstellung der Fotographie (World Exhibition of Photography)]]

Following ''The Family of Man'' by 10 years, the 1965 ''Weltausstellung der Fotographie'' (World Exhibition of Photography) was based on an idea by Karl Pawek and, supported by the German magazine ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'',  toured the world.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Hellmut (1965). Zur "Weltausstellung der Photographie". : Ansprache zur Eröffnung der Weltausstellung der Photographie in der Akademie der Künste am 11. Juli 1965. Akademie der Künste, Berlin&lt;/ref&gt; It presented 555 photographs by 264 authors from 30 countries, outweighing the numbers in Steichen's exhibition.  In the preface to the catalogue entitled 'Die humane Kamera' ('The human camera'), [[Heinrich Böll|Heinrich Boll]] wrote: "There are moments in which the meaning of a landscape and its breath become felt in a photograph. The portrayed person becomes familiar or a historical moment happens in front of the lens; a child in uniform, women who search the battlefield for their dead. They are moments in which crying is more than private as it becomes the crying of mankind. Secrets are not revealed, the secret about human existence becomes visible."

The exhibition, wrote Pawek, 'would like to keep alive the spirit of Edward Steichen's wonderful ideas and of his memorable collection, ''The Family of Man''.'.&lt;ref&gt;Pawek, K. The Language of Photography: The Methods of this Exhibition. In World Exhibition of Photography (1964) &amp; Pawek, Karl &amp; Wilhelm, Peter Jürgen (1964). ''World Exhibition of Photography : 555 photos by 264 photographers from 30 countries on the theme What is man?''. Gruner + Jahr, Hamburg&lt;/ref&gt; His exhibition posed the question 'Who is Man?' in 42 topics. It focussed on issues that were sublimated in ''The Family of Man'' by the idea of universal brotherhood between men and women of different races and cultures. Racism, which in Steichen's show was represented by a lynching scene (replaced in the European showings by an enlargement of the famous picture of the Nürnberg trial), is confronted in the ''Weltausstellung der Fotographie'' section VIII Das Missverständnis mit der Rasse (Misunderstandings about Race) by the black man in the photograph by [[Gordon Parks]] who seems to view from his window two scenes of attacks on black people (photographed by [[Charles Moore (photographer)|Charles Moore]]). Another photograph by Henri Leighton shows two children walking together in public holding hands, one black, one white. Though reference to the content of the older exhibition in the new is evident, the unifying idealism of The Family of Man is here replaced with a much more fragmented and sociological one.&lt;ref name="Jean Back 1997"&gt;Jean Back (1997)  Identities and Differences: Four Historical and Contemporary Approaches Towards The Family Of Man. In Di Felice, Paul &amp; Stiwer, Pierre &amp; Galerie Nei Liicht &amp; Casino Luxembourg (1997).  The 90's : a family of man? : images de l'homme dans l'art contemporain. Casino Luxembourg : Café-Crème, Luxembourg&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition met with rejection by the press and functionaries in the photographic profession in Germany and Switzerland, and was described by Fritz Kempe, board member of a prominent photo company, as "tasty fodder to stimulate the aggressive instincts of semi—intellectual young men.".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Pawek in introduction to Stern (Hamburg) (1968). Die Frau : 2. Weltausstellung der Photographie, 522 Photos aus 85 Ländern von 236 Photographen. Gruner + Jahr, Hamburg&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it went on to tour 261 art museums in 36 countries and was visited by 3,500,000 people.

=== 2nd World Exhibition of Photography ===
[[File:Cover of Stern (Hamburg) (1968). Die Frau 2 Weltausstellung der Photographie.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of Stern (Hamburg) (1968). ''Die Frau: 2 Weltausstellung der Photographie'']]

In 1968, a second ''Weltausstellung der Fotographie'' (2nd World Exhibition of Photography) was devoted to images of women&lt;ref&gt;Stern (Hamburg) (1968). Die Frau : 2. Weltausstellung der Photographie, 522 Photos aus 85 Ländern von 236 Photographen. Gruner + Jahr, Hamburg&lt;/ref&gt; with 522 photographs from 85 countries by 236 photographers, of whom barely 10% were female (compared to 21% for ''The Family of Man''), though there is evidence of the effect of feminist consciousness in images of men in domestic environments cleaning, cooking and tending babies. In his introduction, Karl Pawek writes: "I had approached the first exhibition with my entire theological, philosophical and sociological equipment. 'What is Man'?; the question had to awaken ideological ideas. [...] I also operated from a philosophical point of view when presenting the[se] photos. As far as woman was concerned, the theme of the second exhibition, I knew nothing. There I was, without any philosophy about woman. Perhaps woman is not a philosophical theme. Perhaps there is only mankind, and woman is something unique and special? Thus I could only hold on to what was concrete in the pictures."

=== The Family of Children ===
[[UNESCO]] named 1977 The Year of Children and in response the book ''The Family of Children'' was dedicated to Steichen by editor Jerry Mason, and imitated the original catalogue in its layout, in the use of quotations and in the colours used on the cover.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Jerry (1977). The Family of children. Grosset &amp; Dunlap, New York&lt;/ref&gt;  As for Steichen's show there was a call-out for imagery but 300,000 entries were received compared to the 4 million at the MoMA show, resulting in a selection of 377 photos by 218 participants from 70 countries.

===The Family of Man 1955-1984===
Independent curator [[Marvin Heiferman]]'s ''The Family of Man 1955·1984'' was a floor to ceiling collage of over 850 images and texts from magazines. newspapers and the art world shown in 1984 at  PSI, The Institute for Art and Urban Resources Inc. (now [[MoMA PS1]]) Long Island City N.Y.&lt;ref&gt;Shelley Rice: photographic installation, an overview. In sfcamerawork quarterly, v.12 n.1 Spring 1985&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abigail Solomon-Godeau]] described it as a reexamination of the themes of the 1955 show and critique of Steichen's arrangement of them into a 'spectacle';

&lt;blockquote&gt;...a grab bag of imagery and publicity ranging from baby food and sanitary napkin boxes to hard-core pornography, from detergent boxes to fashion photography, a cornucopia of consumer culture much of which, in one way or another, could be seen to engage the same themes purveyed in ''The Family of Man''. In a certain sense, Heifferman's [sic] riposte to Steichen's show made the useful connection between the spectacle of the exhibition and the spectacle of the commodity, suggesting that both must be understood within the framing context of late capitalism.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Oppositions: We are the world, you are the third world ===
In 1990 the second Rotterdam Biennale lead exhibition was ''Oppositions: We are the world, you are the third world - Commitment and cultural identity in contemporary photography from Japan, Canada. Brazil, the Soviet Union and the Netherlands''&lt;ref&gt;1990). Oppositions : commitment and cultural identity in contemporary photography from Japan, Canada, Brazil, the Soviet Union and the Netherlands. Uitgeverij, Rotterdam&lt;/ref&gt; The cover of the catalogue imitates the layout and colour of the original but replaces the famous image of the little flute player by Eugene Harris with six images, four photographs of young women from different cultural backgrounds and two excerpts from paintings. In the exhibit scenes of a endangered ecology and the threat to cultural identity in the global village predominate, but there are intimations that nature and love may prevail, despite everything artificial that surrounds it, notably so in family life.&lt;ref name="Jean Back 1997"/&gt;

=== New Relations. The Family of Man Revisited ===
In 1992 the American critic and photographer [[Larry Fink (photographer)|Larry Fink]] published a collection of photographs under the heading of ''New Relations. The Family of Man Revisited'' in the Photography Center Quarterly.&lt;ref&gt;Center Quarterly (Woodstock, New York: Photography Center) no. 50 (1991). "It's All Relative" [re: Larry Fink, "New Relations The Family of Man Revisited": 4-17&lt;/ref&gt; His approach updated Steichen's vision by integrating aspects of human existence which Steichen had omitted both because of his wish for coherence and of his innermost convictions. Fink provides only the following commentary: "Rather than a fawn pretence to anthropological/sociologic analysis of the events depicted; rather than categorise and choose democratically for social relevance.| took the path of least resistance and most reward. I simply selected quality images with the belief that the path of strong visual energies would visit equal strong social presences". He concludes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The show is a compendium of visual hints. It is not an answer or even a full question, but cognitive clues....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== family, nation, tribe, community: SHIFT ===
[[File:Cover of the exhibition catalogue 'family, nation, tribe, community, SHIFT'.jpeg|thumb|left|Cover of the exhibition catalogue 'family, nation, tribe, community, SHIFT' 1996.]]

In September/October 1996 the NGBK ([[New Society for Visual Arts|Neue Gesellschaft fur Bildende kunst Berlin]]- New Society for the Visual Arts Berlin) in the context of 'Haus der Kulturen der Welt (HKW)' (House of World Cultures Berlin) conceived and organised the project ''family, nation, tribe, community: SHIFT'' with direct reference to the historical MoMA exhibition. In the catalogue, five authors; [[Ezra Stoller]], [[Max Kozloff]], Torsten Neuendorff, Bettina Allamoda and [[Jean Back]] analyse and comment on the historical model and twenty-two artists offer individual approaches around the following themes: Universalism/Separatism, Family/Anti-family, Individualisation, Common Strategies, Differences. The works are predominantly from artist photographers rather than photojournalists; Bettina Allamoda, [[Aziz + Cucher]], [[Los Carpinteros]], [[Alfredo Jaar]], Mike Kelley, [[Edward Kienholz|Edward]] and [[Nancy Reddin Kienholz]], Lovett/Codagnone, Loring McAlpin, [[Christian Philipp Müller]], Anna Petrie, [[Martha Rosler]], Lisa Schmitz, STURTEVANT, [[Mitra Tabrizian|Mitra Tabizian]] and Andy Golding, [[Wolfgang Tillmans]], Danny Tisdale, Lincoln Tobler, and [[David Wojnarowicz]] reflect major contemporary issues: identity, the information crisis, the illusion of leisure, and ethics. In his introduction to the exhibition, Frank Wagner writes that Steichen had offered a vision of an harmonious, neat and highly structured world which, in reality, was complex, often unintelligible and even contradictory, but by contrast, this Berlin exhibition highlights 'first' and 'third' world tensions and is eager to concentrate on a variety of attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Family, Nation, Tribe, Community SHIFT: Zeitgenössische künstlerische Konzepte im Haus der
Kulturen der Welt (Berlin: Neue Gesellschaft für Bildende Kunst HGBK, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 90s: A Family of Man? ===
[[File:The 90s, A Family of Man? images of mankind in contemporary art.jpg|thumb|The 90s, A Family of Man?: Images of mankind in contemporary art]]

The following year Enrico Lunghi directed the exhibition ''The 90s: A Family of Man?: images of mankind in contemporary art'', held 02.10.-30.11.1997 in Luxembourg, Steichen's birthplace and by then the repository of the archive of a full version of his ''The Family of Man.'' Aside from their understanding of Steichen's efforts to present commonalities amongst the human race, curators Paul di Felice and Pierre Stiwer interpret Steichen's show as an effort to make content of Museum of Modern Art accessible to the public in an era when it was regarded as the elitist supporter of 'incomprehensible' abstract art. They point to their predecessor's success in having his show embraced by a record audience and emphasise that dissenting voices of criticism were heard only amongst 'intellectuals'. However, Steichen's success, they caution, was to manipulate the message of his selected imagery; 'After all,' they write, 'wasn't he the artistic director of Vogue and Vanity Fair ... ?'.&lt;ref&gt;Paul di Felice, Pierre Stiwer (1997) Catalogue réalisé à l'occasion de L'Exposition "The 90s: A Family of Man?" au Casino Luxembourg, Forum d'art contemporain et à la Galerie Nei Liicht de Dudelange en octobre-novembre I997, co-édité par Casino Luxembourg-Forum d'art contemporain et Café-Créme absl., traductions Marie-Jo Decker, Jean-Paul Junck, Pierre Stiwer. Imprimerie Centrale Luxembourg. Dépôt légal octobre I997 {{ISBN|2-919893-07-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They proclaim their desire to retain the exhibiting artists' 'autonomy' while not posing their work as the antithesis of Steichen's concept, but to respect, and echo, its arrangement while 'raising questions' as indicated by the question mark in their quotation of the original title. The exhibition and catalogue 'quote' from Steichen, setting pages of the book of his exhibition with their quotations around groupings of images (in monochrome) beside the works of contemporary artists (predominantly in colour) collected in themes used in the original, though the correlation fails for some contemporary ideas, which digital imaging, installation and montage works effectively convey. The thirty-five artists include [[Christian Boltanski]], [[Nan Goldin]], [[Inez and Vinoodh|Inez van Lamsweerde]], [[Orlan]] and [[Wolfgang Tillmans]].

=== Reconsidering The Family of Man ===
The [[Photographic Society of America|Photographic Society of America (PSA)]] drew on their archives to stage ''Reconsidering The Family of Man'' during April and May 2012. They based the display on the concept of Steichen's original exhibit but concentrated on his sub-theme of the passage from birth to death. From the close to 5,000 photographs in the PSA collection, a selection of 50 was made for their show. One work in common with the original exhibition was [[Ansel Adams]]' ''Mount Williamson from Manzanar'' which in ''The Family of Man'' was presented at mural scale, while the PSA used a vintage,11 "x 14" Adams print from their collection, displaying it wilh a first edition copy of ''The Family of Man'' publication opened to a double-page spread of Adams photograph.&lt;ref&gt;Burris, J. (2012, 04). The PSA print collection and reconsidering the family of man at artspace. ''PSA Journal, 78'', 18-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Family of the Invisibles ===
As part of the 2015-2016 France-Korea year, curators of the [[Centre national des arts plastiques]] (Cnap) and the Fonds Régional d’Art Contemporain of Aquitaine (Frac Aquitaine), Pascal Beausse (Cnap), Claire Jacquet (Frac Aquitaine), and Magali Nachtergael, Assistant Professor at the [[Sorbonne University|Sorbonne]], collaborated to produce the exhibition ''The Family of the Invisibles'' at the [[Seoul Museum of Art]] (SeMA) and the Ilwoo Space in Seoul, from 5 April to 29 May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.institutfrancais-seoul.com/portfolio-item/exposition-the-family-of-the-invisibles/ Exhibition anouncement on the Institut Francais, Seoul website]&lt;/ref&gt; The show was devoted to invisible and minority figures, their demands for identity, and the possibility of reconfiguring a politics of representation to the ideal of giving a place to each member of the human community as represented in more than 200 emblematic photographs. The works  from the 1930s to 2016, drawn from the Cnap and Frac Aquitaine collections were selected on the principle of Roland Barthes' deconstruction identified by the curators in his ''Mythologies'' and in ''Camera Lucida'', the latter being treated as a visual manifesto for minorities. The exhibition was presented in the Seoul Museum of Art in four sections, culminating in provocative contemporary photography including the 2009 series of of deceased migrants wrapped in cloth in ''Les Proscrits'' ('The Outcasts') by Mathieu Pernot, and [[Sophie Calle]]’s 1986 ''Les Aveugles'' in which she photographed those things that her blind subjects described as the most beautiful. The “Prologue” of the exhibition at the Ilwoo Space, provided a critical and historical counterpoint. Texts by Pascal Beausse, Jacqueline Guittard, Claire Jacquet and Magali Nachtergael, Suejin Shin (Ilwoo Foundation) and Kyung-hwan Yeo (SeMA) were presented in a catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;Preface: Kim Hong-Hee, Lee Myonghi.

=== Permanent installation, Chateau Clervaux, Luxembourg ===
The permanent installation of the exhibition today at Chateau Clervaux in Luxembourg follows the layout of the inaugural exhibition at MoMA in order to recreate the original viewing experience, though necessarily it is adapted to the unique space of two floors of the restored Castle. Since the 2013 restoration it now incorporates a library (that includes some of the catalogues of the sequel exhibitions above) and contextualises ''The Family of Man'' with historical material and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Anke Reitz (2018) 'Re-exhibiitng ''The Family of Man'': Luxembourg 2013', in Hurm, Gerd, 1958-, (editor.); Reitz, Anke, (editor.); Zamir, Shamoon, (editor.)

'''Thomas James Reeves''', born in [[Thomaston, Connecticut]], December 9, 1895, was a [[United States Navy|US Navy]] radioman who became the namesake of the [[destroyer escort]] {{USS|Reeves|DE-156|6}}. Reeves was killed during the [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, and [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] received the [[Medal of Honor]].

==Military service==
Thomas Reeves enlisted in the [[United States Naval Reserve]] as Electrician third class on July 20, 1917. Released from duty July 21, 1919, he was recalled to active duty and was transferred to the regular Navy April 16, 1920 and served until discharged August 21, 1921. On October 12, 1921 he re-enlisted in the Navy making it his career.

Advanced through the rates to chief radioman, Reeves was serving in the [[battleship]] {{USS|California|BB-44}} when the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]], December 7, 1941. During that attack the mechanized ammunition hoists in the battleship were put out of commission. Reeves "... on his own initiative, in a burning passageway, assisted in the maintenance of an ammunition supply by hand to the antiaircraft guns until he was overcome by smoke and fire which resulted in his death." For his distinguished conduct, RMC Reeves [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] received the [[Medal of Honor]].

==Namesake==
In 1943, the [[destroyer escort]] {{USS|Reeves|DE-156}} was named in his honor.

"'''When Flanders Failed'''" is the third episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on October 3, 1991. In the episode, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] makes a wish for [[Ned Flanders]]'s new [[left-handed]] store to go out of business. The wish comes true and gets the Flanders family into financial troubles. Ned is forced to sell his possessions, and Homer gleefully buys many of his things. When finding out that Ned's house is to be [[Repossession|repossessed]], Homer feels guilty and decides to get the store back in business by telling all the left-handed citizens about it. Meanwhile, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] takes [[karate]] lessons but quits after discovering that it is not as interesting as he had expected it to be.

The episode was written by [[Jon Vitti]] and directed by [[Jim Reardon]]. It had an unusual amount of animation glitches because the animation studio was training a new group of animators. The episode features cultural references to [[playwright]] [[William Shakespeare]] and the film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''. The title of the episode is a reference to the title of the poem "[[In Flanders Fields]]". Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 13.9, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.

==Plot==
[[Ned Flanders|Ned]] invites the [[Simpson family]] to a barbecue party and announces his plans to open a store for left-handed people; The [[Leftorium]]. During the pulling of a [[Furcula|wishbone]], [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], who has been constantly jealous of the material success of Ned and his family, wishes for The Leftorium to be a failure and go out of business. Homer frequently checks in on Ned to ensure that business is going poorly and is happy to see precisely that happening. When Homer sees left-handed citizens struggling with items made for right-handed people, he thinks about informing them about The Leftorium, but decides not to. Eventually the store does indeed close due to lack of business, plunging the Flanders' into debt and misery. Ned is forced to sell his possessions, and Homer gleefully buys many of Ned's things. Homer starts to regret what he did, but when he goes to return Ned's possessions, he finds Ned's house repossessed and the family living in their car. Homer wrestles with the guilt his wish has brought, and tells Ned to open the store for one final day. He then tells all the left-handed residents of Springfield about The Leftorium, and they all travel to the store and buy things. It is implied that the increase in customers helps Ned keep the store open and get his house back.

In a [[subplot]], [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] begins taking [[karate]] lessons at [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Akira|Akira]]'s karate school. On his first lesson, he finds that karate is quite boring, so he decides to skip each lesson in order to play video games at the mall arcade. Whenever he is questioned by his family and friends about the techniques he has learned, he refers to the "[[Touch of Death]]", an ability he saw in one of the arcade games he played. He proceeds to terrorize his sister [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] into doing his will by threatening her with the technique. His actions catch up to him when Lisa prods him to defend her from the school bullies and reclaim her saxophone. He ends up being [[Debagging|pantsed]] and hung by his underwear from the basketball hoop rim by the bullies, as Lisa (having reclaimed her saxophone) wistfully notes that sometimes two wrongs do make a right.

==Production==
[[Image:Mikereiss.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Mike Reiss]] said he remembers "When Flanders Failed" as the episode with "a thousand mistakes in it".&lt;ref name="Reiss"/&gt;]]
The episode was written by [[Jon Vitti]] and directed by [[Jim Reardon]]. It featured an unusual amount of animation glitches because the animation studio in [[Korea]] was training a new group of animators, and this episode was one of their first efforts.&lt;ref name="Reardon"&gt;{{cite video |people=Reardon, Jim |date=2003 |title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "When Flanders Failed" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Show runner]] [[Mike Reiss]] said he will always remember it as the episode "that came back animated with a thousand mistakes in it and was just a complete and utter mess."&lt;ref name="Reiss"&gt;{{cite video |people=Reiss, Mike |date=2003 |title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "When Flanders Failed" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reardon said there was "literally a mistake in every other scene" when the episode came back from Korea. Several scenes had to be re-animated in the United States because of these glitches, but according to Reardon, "you can still see the lesser ones that got through, such as line quality problems particularly in the first act."&lt;ref name="Reardon"/&gt; Though it aired in season three, "When Flanders Failed" was produced during [[The Simpsons (season 2)|the previous season]]. It was recorded in spring 1991 when the previous season came to an end, and was scheduled to air in autumn that year. The staff therefore had more time to fix the glitches during the summer.&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt;

"When Flanders Failed" features the second appearance of the character Akira, voiced by [[Hank Azaria]]. He was previously seen in the season two episode "[[One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish]]", where he is a waiter at a Japanese restaurant.&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt; It is revealed in this episode that the characters Ned Flanders, [[Moe Szyslak]] and [[Montgomery Burns]] are left-handed, just like ''The Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]].&lt;ref name="Jean"&gt;{{cite video |people=Jean, Al |date=2003 |title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "When Flanders Failed" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Simpsons'' writer [[George Meyer]] came up with the idea of The Leftorium when the creators were trying to figure out what Ned's failed business would be. The inspiration came from a friend of Meyer's who opened a left-handed store that was quickly forced to close down due to lack of business.&lt;ref name="Vitti"&gt;{{cite video |people=Vitti, Jon |date=2003 |title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "When Flanders Failed" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast, "When Flanders Failed" finished 29th in the ratings for the week of September 30 – October 6, 1991, with a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 13.9, equivalent to approximately 12.8&amp;nbsp;million viewing households.

In December 2002, "When Flanders Failed" was utilized in a [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]] [[Sunday School]] class, to stimulate a discussion among both children and adults, about why unfortunate things happen to good people. Phil Brown, the teacher of the class, said the reason they used episodes of ''The Simpsons'' was "to get something that would get the kids excited and be more than just a traditional Sunday School lecture series."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sunday School Classes Learn From 'The Simpsons' |last=Kincaid |first=Jenny |date=December 5, 2002 |work=[[The Roanoke Times]] |pages=S8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Kirk Baird of the ''[[Las Vegas Sun]]'' named it the fifth best episode of ''The Simpsons'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2002/aug/19/dohlightful-the-simpsons-steadily-approaches-tv-mi/ |title=D'ohlightful: The Simpsons’ steadily approaches TV milestone |last=Baird |first=Kirk |date=August 19, 2002 |work=[[Las Vegas Sun]] |accessdate=2009-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Central Michigan Life]]'' called it an "instant classic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.www.cm-life.com/media/storage/paper906/news/2003/09/05/Lifeline/8216simpsons8217.Classic.8216identity8217.Gains.Personality.With.Bonus.Features-2490777.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20071109013230/http://media.www.cm-life.com/media/storage/paper906/news/2003/09/05/Lifeline/8216simpsons8217.Classic.8216identity8217.Gains.Personality.With.Bonus.Features-2490777.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 9, 2007 |title='Simpsons' classic, 'Identity' gains personality with bonus features |date=August 5, 2003 |work=[[Central Michigan Life]] |accessdate=2009-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pete Oliva of ''[[North Texas Daily]]'' said the episode "proves that it is possible to laugh and cry at the same time without being able to control either response."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.www.ntdaily.com/media/storage/paper877/news/2003/08/29/UndefinedSection/Simpsons.Third.Box.Set.Charming.FeatureFilled-1888369.shtml |title=Simpsons' third box set charming, feature-filled |last=Olivia |first=Pete |date=August 29, 2003 |work=[[North Texas Daily]] |accessdate=2009-07-02 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict said "When Flanders Failed" shows that even if ''The Simpsons'' is not dealing with famous celebrities or "high profile places", the writers can still "wring uproarious comedy out of their cast of regulars. Flanders is a special creation in the canon of humor, a regular guy who is funny because of how hyper-normal he is compared to his Neanderthal neighbors. The focus on people who are left-handed, and the whole idea of being a lefty, is an unusual basis for a television show. But then again, nothing about ''The Simpsons'' is ever common."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsonsseason3.php |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season |last=Gibron |first=Bill |date=December 15, 2003 |publisher=DVD Verdict |accessdate=2009-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629194944/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsonsseason3.php |archivedate=June 29, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hock Guan Teh of DVD Town also praised the writers, stating that they "are able to craft a downtrodden tale for the perpetually clueless Flanders family that serves to illustrate how dark emotions can eventually be overcome by Homer's guilt.

Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 3.5/5 rating and commented that "perhaps it is not profound in its examination of jealousy causing people to behave irrationally, but it handles the topic in a serious manner while not compromising the show's humor. The side story with Bart stems from [[Bartmania|the era]] of the series when Bart was the big star, but it still has some funny bits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/displaylegacy.php?ID=6129 |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season |last=Meyers |first=Nate |date=June 23, 2004 |publisher=Digitally Obsessed |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: "Mean Homer equals Funny Homer, so 'When Flanders Failed' presents an above average show. He seems unusually crude here, which makes him amusing. The subplot with Bart and his karate class also adds good material, especially when he threatens to turn the 'Touch of Death' on Lisa. Another sappy finish slightly mars this one, but it remains generally solid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonthree.shtml |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season (1991) |last=Jacobson |first=Colin |date=August 21, 2003 |publisher=DVD Movie Guide |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimberly Potts of [[AOL]] named it tenth best episode of the show and commented: "Schadenfreude is the theme of this tight episode about Homer's joy at the failure of Flanders' Leftorium store. There are few times Homer is more shamelessly smug than he was while imitating Flanders and using Ned's yard sale grill, and we haven't even mentioned Bart's 'Touch of Death' subplot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://television.aol.com/feature/the-simpsons/4 |title='The Simpsons' Best Episodes: No. 10 – 6 |accessdate=2009-09-03 |work=|publisher=[[AOL]] |author=Potts, Kimberly |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Winston-Salem Journal]]'''s Tim Clodfelter called it an "outstanding" episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Toons For Big Folks, Too |last=Clodfelter |first=Tim |date=August 22, 2003 |work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]] |pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1725">'''Æthelstan''' ([[floruit]] 940&amp;ndash;970) was an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] nobleman. He served as an [[Ealdorman]] in southern [[Mercia]] in the reigns of Kings [[Eadwig of England|Eadwig]] and [[Edgar of England|Edgar]]. He is referred to as '''Æthelstan Rota''' (Æthelstan the Red) in one charter, and is so known to distinguish him from [[Æthelstan Half-King]], and another Æthelstan ([[floruit|fl.]] 940&amp;ndash;949), who were Ealdormen in the same period.

Æthelstan rose to prominence in the reign of King Eadwig; [[Æthelflæd of Damerham]], second wife of Eadwig's father King [[Edmund I of England|Edmund]], and thus Eadwig's stepmother, was married to this Æthelstan. Æthelflæd was a woman of considerable influence, and not merely as a relict of King Edmund; her father Ælfgar is described as a ''dux'' and Ealdorman of Essex.  

Æthelstan appears to have had lands in [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Oxfordshire]]. He is a frequent witness to charters of Kings Eadwig and Edgar. The ''Life of Saint Dunstan'' records a vision by a nobleman named Æthelstan and [[Dunstan]]'s interpretation of it as presaging the death of the king and ill times to come. It is not known whether this Æthelstan or Æthelstan Half-King is the Æthelstan referred to.
