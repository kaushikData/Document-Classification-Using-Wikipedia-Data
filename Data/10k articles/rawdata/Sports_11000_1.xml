==Overview==
The stadium was inaugurated in 1952 by a football match played between Accra XI and Kumasi XI.
Originally known as the Accra Sports Stadium, the stadium was renamed after Ohene Djan, the country's first Director of Sports, in 2004 after renovations. Its renaming was quite controversial and opposed by  the Ga people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/SportsArchive/artikel.php?ID=80345 |title=Ohene Djan Did Not Warrant Honour - Adjin Tettey |accessdate=2007-04-06 |date=28 April 2005 |author=Ghanaian Chronicle |work=Sports news |publisher=Ghana Home Page}}
&lt;/ref&gt; There has been ongoing controversy about the name of the stadium. On June 16, 2011, the name 'Ohene Djan Stadium' on the stadium building was changed to 'Accra Sports Stadium' without any official announcement by the Accra Metropolitan Assembly supported by the National Democratic Congress Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/SportsArchive/artikel.php?ID=211396 |title=Ohene Djan Stadium renamed Accra Sports Stadium |accessdate=2011-06-19 |date=2011-06-17 |publisher=Ghana Home Page }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been reverted.

As a designated venue of some of the [[2008 African Cup of Nations]] matches, the stadium was rebuilt, upgraded and modernized to meet [[FIFA]] standards. Work on the stadium was completed in October 2007. It was inaugurated with a four-nations tournament that Ghana won (the Zenith Cup).

The stadium is also the home of one of Africa's most popular clubs, [[Accra Hearts of Oak SC|Hearts of Oak]] as well as [[Great Olympics]], but [[Ghana national football team|Ghana's national team]] matches are sometimes played there.

During the [[2000 African Cup of Nations]] in [[Ghana]] and [[Nigeria]], the stadium hosted 9 matches,&lt;ref name=stadium&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/sport/football/africa/cup_of_nations/accra.stm |title=Accra National Stadium |accessdate=2007-04-06 |work=Cup of Nations Venue Guide |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also the venue of the [[1978 African Cup of Nations|1978 final]].

'''Aerobic gymnastics''' or '''sport aerobics''' is a competitive sport originating from traditional [[aerobics]] in which complex, high-intensity movement patterns and elements of varying difficulty are performed to music.

==Nature of the game==

The performance area is {{convert|7|m}} square for juniors or {{convert|10|m}} square for adults and for aero dance and step.

In International competition there are 7 different events: Individual Women, Individual Men, Mixed Pairs, Trios, Group (five athletes), Step and Dance (both eight athletes). The last four are regardless of the Genders of the athletes.

The performances are made up of four groups of elements.   The routine must be performed entirely to music. 

In the competition, there are specific requirements regarding the outfit, the number of elements performed, the number of lifts performed, the number of elements performed on the floor and much more.  

Performances are scored in the following areas:  artistry, execution, difficulty and the chair of the judges panel determines the final score deductions based on deductions that change with each code of points. If the combined scores are the same, the tiebreaker is the team with higher execution scores.   

The long-term ultimate goal of the sport of aerobic gymnastics is to be included in the Olympic Games.

==Competitive aerobic gymnastics==

=== FIG aerobics ===
The competitive aerobic gymnastics are governed by the [[Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique]] (FIG). The FIG designs the Code of Points and regulates all aspects of international elite competition. Within individual countries, gymnastics is regulated by national federations. In 1995, the FIG recognised sport aerobics as a new competitive gymnastics discipline, organised judges and coaches courses and launched the 1st [[Aerobic Gymnastics World Championships]]  in Paris (34 countries). In 1997, the IWGA ([[International World Games Association]]) included Aerobic Gymnastics in its programme of the 5th [[World Games]] ([[Lahti]], [[Finland]]).&lt;ref name=figHistory&gt;[http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/vsite/vcontent/page/custom/0,8510,5187-188589-205811-44714-283047-custom-item,00.html Federation Internationale de Gymnastique]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705113142/http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/vsite/vcontent/page/custom/0%2C8510%2C5187-188589-205811-44714-283047-custom-item%2C00.html |date=5 July 2009 }} History of Aerobic Gymnastics with the FIG:  &lt;/ref&gt; Since 1999 The European Union of Gymnastics has been conducting Aerobic European Gymnastics Championships in all uneven years.&lt;ref name=UEG&gt;[http://www.ueg-gymnastics.com/commstore/commstore2.pl/93fa6128715b50e9/en/default.html?k=88&amp;block_id=head,P3,content&amp;P1=47&amp;P2=47&amp;P3=disciplines&amp;P4=5&amp;P10=47&amp;P9=88 European Union of Gymnastics]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} History of Aerobic Gymnastics&lt;/ref&gt; Leading nations who have provided World Medallists are: [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Chile]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[New Zealand]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]] and [[Spain]].&lt;ref name = figHistory/&gt;

=== National Aerobic Championships ===
The '''National Aerobic Championships''' is a competition of aerobic gymnastics started in 1984 in the United States. Founded by Sport Fitness International, it was the first major championships in the sport predating the [[Aerobic Gymnastics World Championships]] by 11 years. From 1988 onwards the individual events were separated by gender.  The sport became popular around the world after it gained popularity in the USA when major championships were aired on ESPN during the height of the fitness movement in the USA.  

== In Popular Culture ==
The sport was added in the biannual [[Idol Star Athletics Championships]] for Lunar New Year, 2017 as a male team equivalent to the female individual rhythmic gymnastics, and the scores are given in accordance to FIG Standards. [[Seventeen (band)|Seventeen]] (9.8 Technical+9.3 Execution-0.0 Penalty) and [[Astro (South Korean band)|ASTRO]] (9.75+9.45-0.1) both scored 19.10 out of 20.00, but since ASTRO scored higher in Execution, ASTRO won the inaugural event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/5qzllz/isac_idol_star_athletics_championships/|title=ISAC (Idol Star Athletics Championships) Performances and Results 2017 Seollal Special • r/kpop|website=reddit|language=en|access-date=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== FISAF aerobics ===
The [[Federation of International Sports, Aerobics and Fitness]] (FISAF) is an international [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] "umbrella organization" active in over 40 countries.  It is self-described as "the largest [[physical fitness|fitness]] industry organisation in the world" and "the largest instructor certification agency in the world".

[[Image:Ballet shoes in fifth position.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Leather ballet shoes, with feet shown in [[Glossary of ballet#Positions of the feet|fifth position]]]]
A '''ballet shoe''', or '''ballet slipper''', is a lightweight shoe designed specifically for ballet dancing. It may be made from soft leather, canvas, or satin, and has flexible, thin soles. Traditionally, women wear pink shoes and men wear white or black shoes. Tan colored slippers—which are unobtrusive and thus give the appearance of dancing barefoot—are worn in modern ballets and sometimes modern dancing by both men and women. 

All dancers typically wear ballet slippers at the beginning of a ballet class, whereas female dancers may change into [[pointe shoes]] for centre work and performance.

Ballet shoes must fit very closely to the foot, for safety and to retain maximum flexibility.

==Construction==
Ballet shoes traditionally have a leather sole which does not reach all the way to the edges of the shoe. A modern development is the split sole, which provides greater flexibility and emphasizes the shape of the foot when pointed. They are usually made from soft leather, canvas or satin. [[Leather]] shoes are long-lasting. [[Canvas]] shoes are less expensive but wear faster than average leather ballet shoes. [[Satin]] shoes are often used for performances but can wear out very quickly. 

Shoes are secured with the use of [[Elastomer|elastic]], most often with a single band across the arch of the foot, or with two bands that cross in an "X" shape at the top of the arch. In the case of double band shoes, some ballet slipper manufacturers will attach one end of each band to the shoe as part of the production process, and leave it to the purchaser to attach the free ends of the bands for optimal fit.

== History ==
Women began to dance ballet in 1682, twenty years after King [[Louis XIV of France]] ordered the founding of the [[Paris_Opera#The_Opera_under_Louis_XIV|Royal Academy of Dance]]. At that time, the standard women's ballet shoe had [[heel (shoe)|heel]]s. Mid 18th century dancer [[Marie Camargo]] of the [[Paris Opéra Ballet]] was the first to wear a non-heeled shoe. After the [[French Revolution]], heels were completely eliminated from standard ballet shoes, as they still are.

'''[[Barbados]]''' first competed at the '''[[Summer Olympic Games]]''' in [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], and has participated in each Games since then, missing only the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] by participating in the [[American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics|American-led boycott]] of those games. The country's only Olympic medal to date is a bronze won by sprinter [[Obadele Thompson]] in the men's 100 metres at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]].

Barbados competed as part of the [[West Indies Federation]] in [[British West Indies at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960]]. Barbadian athlete [[James Wedderburn (athlete)|James Wedderburn]] was part of the 4 × 400 m relay team which won the bronze medal that year.

Barbados has never competed in the [[Winter Olympic Games]] ([[List of participating nations at the Winter Olympic Games|list]]).

'''FC Minsk Stadium''' is a [[Association football|football]] stadium in [[Minsk]], [[Belarus]]. It is a home ground of [[FC Minsk]]. The stadium holds 3,000 people.

== History ==
The stadium was built at the same location as former '''Kamvolschik Stadium''', which was most recently used for lower leagues, youth and reserve teams matches. By mid-2000s it had been largely abandoned and was slowly decaying. In the past, the stadium was used for [[Belarusian SSR]] league games and as an occasional substitute pitch for [[Belarusian Premier League]] and [[Belarusian Cup]] games by various clubs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sb.by/sport/article/bylem-poroslo.html Abandoned stadiums in Minsk]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern use ==
In 2011 Kamvolschik Stadium was demolished. The new '''FC Minsk Stadium''' was built between 2012 and 2015&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressball.by/pbonline/football/78272 FC Minsk building new stadium]&lt;/ref&gt; and opened in May 2015. Since then it was used primarily as a home venue by [[FC Minsk]], as well as their [[FC Minsk (women)|women's team]]. Additionally, the stadium hosted [[FC Minsk (women)|FC Minsk women's team]] [[UEFA Women's Champions League]] home maches as well as [[UEFA Youth League]] matches by FC Minsk youth squad.

== History ==

'''John Bryant''' (born c. 1717, probably at [[Bromley]], [[Kent]]; died 23 July 1772, probably at Bromley) was an English [[professionalism|professional]] [[cricket]]er who played in top-class matches through the 1740s and 1750s. He was mainly associated with [[Bromley Cricket Club]] and [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]]. Although information about his career is limited by a lack of surviving data, he is known to have made nineteen [[single wicket cricket|single wicket]] and thirteen [[first-class cricket|first-class]] appearances between 1743 and 1756. His brother was [[James Bryant (Kent cricketer)|James Bryant]].

==Earliest mentions==
The first definite mention of John Bryant is in the single wicket "threes" match at the Artillery Ground on Monday, 11 July 1743. The six players involved were stated by the ''London Evening Post'' to be "the best in England".&lt;ref name="ASW"&gt;Ashley-Cooper&lt;/ref&gt; They were [[William Hodsoll]], [[John Cutbush (cricketer)|John Cutbush]] and [[Val Romney]] playing as Three of Kent; and [[Richard Newland (cricketer)|Richard Newland]], [[William Sawyer (cricketer)|William Sawyer]] and John Bryant playing as Three of [[All-England Eleven|All-England]]. Hodsoll and Newland were the captains. Kent won by 2 runs. The crowd was "computed" (''sic'') to be 10,000. A return match was arranged at [[Sevenoaks Vine]] on Wednesday, 27 July, but it did not come off.&lt;ref name="ASW"/&gt;

==Cricket career==
During the next three seasons, the Bryants were regularly involved in top-class matches, both first-class and single wicket. In 1747, they played for Kent against [[Non-international England cricket teams|All-England]] in the biggest match of the season.&lt;ref name="ASW"/&gt; In early August 1747, there were two single wicket matches at the Artillery Ground which were organised by the [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond|2nd Duke of Richmond]]. In the first, three of his employees [[Stephen Dingate]], [[Joseph Rudd]] and [[Pye (Sussex cricketer)|Pye]] defeated [[Little Bennett]], [[Tall Bennett]] and [[William Anderson (18th-century cricketer)|William Anderson]]. In the second, the same threes were to play again but in a "fives" match with the two Bryants added to the Duke's team and with [[Tom Faulkner]] and one of [[Joe Harris (cricketer)|Joe]] or [[Joe Harris (cricketer)|John Harris]] to their opponents. The result of the second game is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;McCann, p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;

1748 was the great year of single wicket, which has never been more popular before or since. There were five matches in which both Bryants took part and one which featured John only.&lt;ref&gt;From Lads to Lord's – 1748.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1749, the brothers were "given men" playing for [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] against All-England and then both played for Colchin's invitation XI against [[Stephen Dingate]]'s team.&lt;ref name="ASW"/&gt; There was a tri-series of matches between Kent and Surrey in 1750 with the brothers both playing for Kent, who won the first and third matches of the series, the decider by 1 wicket. Later in the season, they played for [[Dartford Cricket Club|Dartford]] as given men against [[Addington Cricket Club|Addington]], Dartford winning the match by 6 runs, and then for Dingate's "fives" team in a tri-series against [[Tom Faulkner]]'s side.&lt;ref name="ASW"/&gt;

James Bryant made his last known appearances in 1751 while John continued until 1756. He is not known to have played for Bromley again and the later mentions of him are as a given man for both Dartford and [[London Cricket Club|London]]. He was last recorded on Monday, 6 September 1756 playing for Darford against London at the Artillery Ground.&lt;ref&gt;Waghorn, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 23 July 1772.

'''Lewes''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|uː|i|s}}) is the [[county town]] of [[East Sussex]] and formerly all of [[Sussex]]. It is a [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] and is the centre of the [[Lewes (district)|Lewes local government district]]. Its population is now around 17,000. The settlement is a traditional market town and centre of communications and in 1264, it was the site of the [[Battle of Lewes]].  The town's landmarks include [[Lewes Castle]], the remains of [[Lewes Priory]], Bull House (the former home of [[Tom Paine]]), Southover Grange and public gardens, and a 16th century timber-framed [[Wealden hall house]] known as [[Anne of Cleves House]]. Other notable features of the area include the [[Glyndebourne]] festival, the [[Lewes Bonfire]] and the [[Lewes Pound]].

==History==

[[Archaeological]] evidence points to [[prehistoric]] dwellers in the area. Scholars think that the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlement of ''Mutuantonis'' was here, as quantities of artefacts have been discovered in the area. The [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxons]] built a castle, having first constructed its [[Motte-and-bailey|motte]] as a defensive point over the river; they gave the town its name.&lt;ref name=gazetteer&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/entry_page.jsp?text_id=739550&amp;word=NULL |title=Descriptive Gazetteer entry for Lewes |accessdate=21 September 2008 |last=Wilson |first=John Marius |date=1870{{ndash}}72 |work=Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales |publisher=Great Britain Historical GIS Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]], [[William the Conqueror]] rewarded [[William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey]], with the [[Rape of Lewes]], a swathe of land along the River Ouse from the coast to the Surrey boundary. He built [[Lewes Castle]] on the Saxon site; and he and his wife, [[Gundred]] also founded the [[Lewes Priory|Priory of St Pancras]], a [[Cluniac]] monastic house, in about 1081. Lewes was the site of a [[Mint (coin)|mint]] during the Late [[Anglo-Saxon]] period and thereafter a [[History of the English penny (1066-1154)|mint]] during the early years after the [[Normans|Norman]] invasion. In 1148 the town was granted a charter by King Stephen. The town became a port with docks along the [[River Ouse, Sussex|Ouse River]].

The town was the site of the [[Battle of Lewes]] between the forces of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] and [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] in the [[Second Barons' War]] in 1264, at the end of which de Montfort's forces were victorious. The battle took place in fields now just west of [[Landport]]. (Professor David Carpenter gave a lecture about the [[Battle of Lewes]] at Lewes Town Hall in the summer of 2010; it can be heard at the following website.&lt;ref&gt;http://cdn1.libsyn.com/radiolewes/battle_of_lewes_lecture.m4a?nvb=20100925185416&amp;nva=20100926190416&amp;t=070f9293a3062edb7a32d&lt;/ref&gt; )

At the time of the [[Marian Persecutions]] of 1555–1557, Lewes was the site of the execution of seventeen [[Protestant]] [[martyr]]s, who were burned at the stake in front of the Star Inn. This structure is now the Town Hall. A memorial to the martyrs was unveiled on Cliffe Hill in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Kevin|title=Martyrs remembered in day of speeches|url=http://www.sussexexpress.co.uk/news/nostalgia/kevin-gordon-martyrs-remembered-in-day-of-speeches-1-6154141|work=Sussex Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 17th and 18th centuries, Lewes developed as the county town of East Sussex, expanding beyond the line of the town wall. It was an active port and developed related iron, brewing, and ship building industries.

In 1846 the town became a railway junction, with lines constructed from the north, south and east to two railway stations. The development of [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]] ended Lewes's period as a major port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/sussex/vol7/pp7-19|title=The borough of Lewes: Introduction and history - British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Crimean War]], some 300 Finns serving in the Russian army captured at [[Battle of Bomarsund|Bomarsund]] were imprisoned at Lewes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bomarsundssallskapet.ax/bomarsund_oolannin_sota.htm|title=Oolannin sota|publisher=Bomarsundssällskapet r.f.|language=Finnish|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewes became a [[borough]] in 1881.

==Governance==

The name Lewes is also the name of the [[Lewes (UK Parliament constituency)|parliamentary constituency]] and the local [[Lewes (district)|district council]] as well as Lewes Town Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewes-town.co.uk/ |title=Lewes Town Council |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515225740/http://www.lewes-town.co.uk/ |archivedate=15 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewes is also where the [[East Sussex]] County Council has its main offices, located at County Hall in St Anne’s Crescent. [[Lewes (district)|Lewes District Council]] is administered from offices in Southover House on Southover Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewes.gov.uk/ |title=Lewes District Council |publisher=Lewes.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=1 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125161456/http://www.lewes.gov.uk/ |archivedate=25 November 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lewes Town Council is based in the Town Hall on Lewes High Street.

For many years, Lewes was dominated by the Conservatives, both at local and national levels. In 1991, however, the Liberal Democrats won the District Council for the first time, and the constituency returned a Liberal Democrat MP for the first time in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-13315062|title=Liberal Democrats lose Lewes to Conservatives|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Conservatives won control of the District Council in 2011, and strengthened this position in 2015. They also won back the parliamentary seat in the 2015 election with [[Maria Caulfield]] defeating the incumbent Liberal Democrat of 18 years, [[Norman Baker]] by 1,083 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-england-32615494|title=Norman Baker loses Lewes while Greens' Caroline Lucas re-elected|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In organisational terms, Lewes became one of the non-county boroughs within the then Sussex, East county under the Local Government Act 1933. In 1974, Lewes District Council was formed on 1 April 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, and was a merger of the former borough of Lewes along with Newhaven and Seaford urban districts and Chailey Rural District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewes.gov.uk/council/3726.asp |title=Armorial Bearings (Coat Of Arms) |first=Lewes District |last=Council |website=www.lewes.gov.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710054652/http://www.lewes.gov.uk/council/3726.asp |archivedate=10 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The election in 2015 was the first time in which Green Councillors had been elected to the Lewes District Council, all from the wards in the town of Lewes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/12941316.Green_Party_makes_historic_win_with_first_councillors_in_history_voted_to_sit_on_Lewes_District_Council/|title=Green Party makes historic win with first councillors in history voted to sit on Lewes District Council|work=The Argus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lewes Councillor elected to the District Council, Ruth O'Keeffe, was elected as Chairman of the Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewes.gov.uk/news/23299.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710083640/http://www.lewes.gov.uk/news/23299.asp |archivedate=10 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of Lewes became a [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] with the title of town;&lt;ref name="Lewes Town Council"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewes-tc.gov.uk/|title=Lewes Town Council|year=2007|publisher=Lewes Town Council|page=1|accessdate=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are three wards, Bridge, Castle and Priory, each being served by six councillors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escis.org.uk/Directory/All_local_areas/Government_and_Local_Services/East_Sussex_Town_Councils/Lewes_Town_Council_Councillors/1 |title=List of Councillors, 2008 |publisher=Escis.org.uk |date= |accessdate=1 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716123152/http://www.escis.org.uk/Directory/All_local_areas/Government_and_Local_Services/East_Sussex_Town_Councils/Lewes_Town_Council_Councillors/1 |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewes Town Council is one of the 300 largest of the roughly 9,800 parish councils in England and Wales, with expenditure budgeted at just over £1 million. In the 2015 elections for Lewes Town Council, the Green Party were the largest party with 9 seats. But, they lost a seat to an Independent in a by-election and then split. There are now 6 Liberal Democrats, 5 Greens, 4 Independents and 3 Independent Green members of Council. The Mayor for 2017/18 is Councillor Michael Chartier and the Deputy Mayor is Janet Baah, both Liberal Democrats.

The representation from Lewes wards at local government levels, as at the latest elections (2015 for the Town and District Councils and 2017 for the County Council), is as follows.

On 31 March 2009 Hilary Benn, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, announced his decision to confirm the designation of the [[South Downs National Park]], which came into being exactly one year later and includes the town of Lewes within its boundaries.

==Geography==
{{quote|''You can see Lewes lying like a box of toys under a great amphitheatre of chalk hills ... on the whole it is set down better than any town I have seen in England.''|[[William Morris]]  (1834-1896)}}

{{wide image|Lewes wiki.jpg|850px|Panoramic view of Lewes}}

Lewes is situated on the [[Greenwich Meridian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dolan|first=Graham|title=The Greenwich Meridian|url=http://www.thegreenwichmeridian.org/tgm/location.php?i_latitude=50.873169&amp;i_type=|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a gap in the [[South Downs]], cut through by the [[River Ouse, Sussex|River Ouse]], and near its confluence with the Winterbourne Stream. It is approximately seven miles north of [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]], and an equal distance north-east of [[Brighton and Hove|Brighton]].

The South Downs rise above the river on both banks. The High Street, and earliest settlement, occupies the west bank, climbing steeply up from the bridge taking its ancient route along the ridge; the summit on that side, 2.5&amp;nbsp;miles (4&amp;nbsp;km) distant is known as Mount Harry. On the east bank there is a large [[chalk]] [[cliff]] Cliffe Hill that can be seen for many miles, part of the group of hills including [[Mount Caburn]], Malling Down (where there are a few houses in a wooded area on the hillside, in a development known as Cuilfail) and Golf Hill (home to the Lewes Golf Club). The two banks of the river are joined by Willey's Bridge (a footbridge), the Phoenix Causeway (a recent concrete road bridge, named after the old Phoenix Ironworks) and Cliffe Bridge (an 18th century replacement of the [[mediaeval]] crossing, widened in the 1930s and now semi-pedestrianised).

The High Street runs from Eastgate to West-Out, forming the spine of the ancient town. Cliffe Hill gives its name to the one-time village of Cliffe, now part of the town. The southern part of the town, Southover, came into being as a village adjacent to the Priory, south of the Winterbourne Stream. At the north of the town's original wall boundary is the St. John's or Pells area, home to several 19th century streets and the Pells Pond. The [[Pells Pool]], built in 1860, is the oldest freshwater ''lido'' in England. The Phoenix Industrial Estate lies along the west bank of the river and contains a number of light industrial and creative industry uses, as well as car parks and a fire station. A potential regeneration project, "The North Street Quarter", for the area would be the largest in Lewes since the South Malling residential area was developed in the 1950s and 1960s and in the South Downs since it became a National Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southdowns.gov.uk/planning/planning-applications/north-street-quarter-lewes/ |title='North Street Quarter Lewes'; |publisher=South Downs National Park Authority |accessdate=24 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malling lies to the east of the river and had 18th and 19th century houses and two notable breweries. Road engineering and local planning policy in the 1970s cleared many older buildings here to allow the flow of traffic; the main road route east from the town now goes along Little East Street, across the Phoenix Bridge and through the Cuilfail Tunnel to join the A27.

The town boundaries were enlarged twice (from the original town walls), in 1881 and 1934. They now include the more modern housing estates of Wallands, South Malling (the west part of which is a previously separate village with a church dedicated to St. Michael), Nevill, Lansdown and Cranedown on the Kingston Road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=56908 "The borough of Lewes: Introduction and history"], ''A History of the County of Sussex'': Volume 7 (1940), pp. 7-19, Accessed: 19 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Countryside walks can be taken starting from several points in Lewes. One can walk over Mount Caburn to the village of [[Glynde]] starting in Cliffe, traverse the [[Lewes Brooks]] (an [[RSPB]] reserve) from Southover, walk to [[Kingston near Lewes]] also from Southover, head up Landport Bottom to Mount Harry and [[Blackcap, East Sussex|Black Cap]] along the edge of the old Lewes Racecourse, or wander up along the Ouse to [[Hamsey Place]] from the Pells. The [[South Downs Way]] crosses the Ouse just south of Lewes at Southease and hikers often stop off at the town.

===Natural sites and events===

Three [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] lie within the parish: [[Lewes Downs]], [[Lewes Brooks]] and [[Southerham Works Pit]]. Lewes Downs is a site of [[biological]] interest, an isolated area of the South Downs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=SSSI Citation — Lewes Downs |publisher=Natural England |url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1002952.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=12 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030112238/http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1002952.pdf |archivedate=30 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewes Brooks, also of biological importance, is part of the floodplain of the [[River Ouse, Sussex|River Ouse]], providing a habitat for many invertebrates such as water beetles and snails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=SSSI Citation — Lewes Brooks |publisher=Natural England |url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1003002.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=12 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030112240/http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1003002.pdf |archivedate=30 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Southerham Works Pit is of [[geological]] interest, a disused [[chalk]] pit displaying a wide variety of fossilised fish remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; The Railway Land nature reserve is on the east side of the town next to the Ouse, and contains an area of woodland and marshes, which now includes the Heart of Reeds, a sculpted reed bed designed by local land artist Chris Drury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heart of Reeds |website=The Railway Land Project |url=http://railwaylandproject.org/Heart%20of%20Reeds |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515131810/http://www.railwaylandproject.org/Heart%20of%20Reeds |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 May 2009 |accessdate=3 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Winterbourne stream, a tributary of the Ouse, flows through it. This stream flows most winters and dries up in the summer, hence its name. It continues through Lewes going through the Grange Gardens and often travelling underground. The Heart of Reeds is one of the sites in [[East Sussex]] and [[Kent]] home to the [[marsh frog]], an introduced species. It is popular with pond-dippers and walkers. A centre for the study of environmental change is due to be built at the entrance to the nature reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://railwaylandproject.org/ |title='&amp;#39;Railway Land Project'&amp;#39; |publisher=Railwaylandproject.org |date=28 July 2011 |accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 December 1836, an [[Lewes avalanche|avalanche]] occurred in Lewes, the worst ever recorded in Britain. A large build-up of snow on the nearby cliff slipped down onto a row of cottages called Boulters Row (now part of South Street). About fifteen people were buried, and eight of these died. A [[public house|pub]] in South Street is named ''The Snowdrop'' in memory of the event.

On 21 August 1864, Lewes experienced an [[earthquake]] measuring 3.1 on the [[Richter magnitude scale]].

In October 2000 the town suffered major [[flood]]ing during an intense period of severe weather throughout the United Kingdom. The commercial centre of the town and many residential areas were devastated. In a government report into the nationwide flooding, Lewes was officially noted the most severely affected location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.private-eye.co.uk/covers.php?showme=1013 The flooded railway station featured on the cover of that week's ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'' with the caption "Your Rains Tonight"]&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of the devastation, the Lewes Flood Action group formed, to press for better flood protection measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewes-flood-action.org.uk/ |title=Lewes Flood Action Website |publisher=Lewes-flood-action.org.uk |date= |accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious buildings==
{{See also|List of places of worship in Lewes (district)}}

===Church of England===

* St. Michael's is located at the top of the High Street and like St. Peter's in nearby [[Southease]] it has a round tower (with a shingled spire). Its length runs along the street rather than away from it and the cemetery is separated from the High Street by stone walls with iron railings on top. Next to it is a building which is used upstairs as a [[Sunday school]].
* Further west is St. Anne's,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crsbi.ac.uk/ed/sx/lewsa/index.htm Details of Church of St. Anne, Lewes from Corpus of Romanesque Sculpture in Britain and Ireland]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a quiet church surrounded by its graveyard, which gives its name to the street it is on.
* [[Church of St John sub Castro, Lewes|St John sub Castro]] ([[Latin language|Latin]] for St. John-under-the-Castle) is the northernmost church in the old town. The surrounding town quarter is called St. John's. The church's boundaries are actually protected on one side by the Town Walls, although originally St. John's was a small [[Saxon architecture|Saxon]] building. It was destroyed in the 19th century but the main door was kept and used as an east door for the large new church, built in 1839 by George Cheeseman&lt;ref name="buildings1"&gt;''The Buildings of England: Sussex'' - [[Ian Nairn]], [[Nikolaus Pevsner]]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[flint]] and [[brick]]. In the graveyard there is a [[Russian Memorial, Lewes|memorial]] to the Finnish prisoners kept in the old naval prison in the 19th century. St. John's Church Hall is a couple of streets away in Talbot Terrace.
* In Cliffe there is St. Thomas à Becket's, where the [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] Community also worship.
* In Southover, St John the Baptist's is located on Southover High Street. The nave incorporates the [[hospitium]] of the [http://www.lewespriory.org.uk/ Priory of St Pancras].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Bamber |url=http://www.southover.org.uk/history/history2.htm |title=Southover Church Website - Who We Were |publisher=Southover.org.uk |date= |accessdate=18 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323020511/http://www.southover.org.uk/history/history2.htm |archivedate=23 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbouring it is Church End and down the road at St. James Street [[cul-de-sac]], the Church Hall. In its grounds is the Southover War Memorial, which is distinct from the main [[Lewes War Memorial]].
* St. Michael, South Malling dates from 1628 and was once in a village of its own. The development of the suburbs has connected South Malling to Lewes although the church maintains its village setting by the River Ouse, with the neighbouring rectory.

====Deconsecrated====

* All Saints' is next to the site of a [[Priory]] of [[Grey Friars]] ([[Franciscan]] monks) the only relic of which is an archway at the end of the church boundary wall, which is on the line of the town wall. The medieval tower survives, abutting a later brick nave by [[Amon Wilds]] (1806)&lt;ref name="buildings1"/&gt; and 19th century Gothic style chancel.

The [[Roman Catholic]] church is dedicated to St. Pancras in memory of the Priory and is a red-brick building over the street from St. Anne's.

=== Non-conformist ===
* The [[Religious Society of Friends]] (finished 1784) is a Quaker meeting house next to the former All Saints' Church (now an arts centre) on Friar's Walk.
* The [[Jireh Chapel]], off Malling Street, is a Grade I listed building,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eastsussex.gov.uk/yourcouncil/agendasreportsminutes/countycouncil/reports/CC25Jul2000ReportOfScrutinyCommitteeForEnhancingTheEnvironment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; being a rare survivor of its type dating from 1805. It now houses the [[Lewes Free Presbyterian Church]].
* Westgate Chapel is a 16th century building located in a yard at the top of the High Street (Grade 2 listed). So called because of its position at the old West Gate of the town wall, the Chapel first officially opened for worship as Westgate Meeting in 1700 as English Presbyterian but soon joined by an Independent congregation. Its liberal stance allowed it to become a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church by 1820 (when the congregation of [[Southover General Baptist Chapel]] joined) and is still a Unitarian chapel today.
* Eastgate Chapel is a very different building; a neo Norman design of 1843 in dark flint, it originally had a pepper pot dome but this was removed in favour of a traditional spire in case traffic vibrations below made it fall off. A modern extension was added to the church.
* [http://www.christ-church-lewes.org Christ Church], a modern (1953) building, serves a united congregation of [[United Reformed Church]] and [[Methodist]] worshippers.
* [[Southover General Baptist Chapel]] was built in Eastport Lane in 1741. The congregation's views moved towards Unitarianism, and in the 19th century they joined Westgate Chapel. The building has been a house since 1972, but had various religious and secular uses before that.

==Demography==

In 2001 the service industries were by far the biggest employers in Lewes: over 60% of the population working in that sector. A little over 10% are employed in manufacturing, mostly in the smaller industrial units, particularly those in the Mallings Business Centre.

The town is a net daytime exporter of employees with a significant community working in London and Brighton whilst it draws in employees of the numerous local government and public service functions on which its local economy is strongly dependent.

An important part of the town’s economy is based on tourism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewes.gov.uk/Files/ldscs_october_2007_11.pdf|archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20090727002156/http://www.lewes.gov.uk/Files/ldscs_october_2007_11.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 July 2009|title=Lewes Town Profile|author=|date=|website=webarchive.org.uk|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the town's many historic attractions and its location.

As referenced in the governance section, the town is also where three tiers of local government have their headquarters, and the head office of [[Sussex Police]] is also in Lewes.&lt;ref name="Non-emergency enquiries"&gt;"[https://www.sussex.police.uk/contact-us/non-emergency-enquiries Non-emergency enquiries]."

{{main|Lewes Bonfire}}
The town's most important annual event is the [[Lewes Bonfire]] celebrations on 5 November, [[Guy Fawkes Night]]. In Lewes this event not only marks the date of the uncovering of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] in 1605, but also commemorates the memory of the seventeen Protestant martyrs [[Burned at the stake|burnt at the stake]] for their faith during the [[Marian Persecutions]]. The celebrations, which controversially involve burning an effigy of [[Pope Paul V]], who was pope during the martyrdoms, are the largest and most famous bonfire night celebrations in the country.&lt;ref name=Writers2009 &gt;{{cite news |title=Tonight’s the night: bonfires and fireworks |author=Times Writers |date=5 November 2009 |newspaper=Times |url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article6903456.ece |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewes Bonfire Council"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewesbonfirecouncil.org.uk/ |title=Lewes Bonfire Council |publisher=Lewes Bonfire Council |date= |accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:Harveys Brewery (Lewes).jpg|thumb|left|[[Harveys Brewery]] in the centre of Lewes]]
The Lewes Chamber of Commerce represents the traders and businesses of the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leweschamber.org.uk/ |title=Lewes Chamber of Commerce |publisher=Leweschamber.org.uk |date= |accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town has been identified as unusually diversified with numerous specialist, independent retailers, counter to national trends toward 'chain' retailers and large corporate retail outlets.

Lewes Farmers' Market, one of the first in the UK, was started in the 1990s by Common Cause Co-operative Ltd&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commoncause.org.uk |title=Common Cause Cooperative |publisher=Commoncause.org.uk |date= |accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a popular re-invention of Lewes as a market town. The Farmers' Market takes place in pedestrianised Cliffe High Street on the first and third Saturdays of every month, with local food producers coming to sell their wares under covered market stalls. A weekly food market in the Lewes Market Tower was established in July 2010 by Transition Town Lewes to allow traders to sell local produce. Occasionally French traders from the [[Twin Town]] of [[Blois]] attend, vending on Cliffe Bridge.

From 1794 beers, wines and spirits were distributed from Lewes under the ''Harveys'' name, and the town is today the site of [[Harvey &amp; Son]]'s brewery celebrated as one of the finest ale producers in England.

In September 2008, Lewes launched its own currency, the [[Lewes Pound]], in an effort to increase trade within the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/7605639.stm |title=Lewes launches its own currency |publisher=BBC News |date=9 September 2008 |accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4744116.ece The Times: Town's pound note bucks the downturn] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Lewes Pound is equal to £1. Like the similar [[local currency]] in [[Totnes]], the initiative is part of the [[Transition Towns]] movement. The Lewes Pound and the [[Transition Towns]] movement have received criticism for a failure to address the needs of the wider Lewes population, especially lower socio-economic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Joanna Simmons |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/nov/01/consumeraffairs-communities |title=Lewes Pound - sparkler or damp squib? |work=The Guardian |date= 1 November 2008|accessdate=1 August 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such local currency initiatives have been more widely criticised in light of limited success stimulating new spending in local economies and as an unrealistic strategy to reduce carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harford |first=Tim |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2190116/ |title=The Undercover Economist on Local Currency |publisher=Slate.com |date=3 May 2008 |accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lewes Pound can be exchanged for the same amount of [[pounds sterling]] in several shops in Lewes and can be spent in a wide range of local businesses. Many of the notes were sold on [[eBay]] at a higher amount. Early numbers and sequenced notes fetched very high prices from foreign collectors.

==Landmarks==

[[File:Lewes Castle towers.JPG|thumb|right|Lewes Castle]]
The town is the location of several significant historic buildings, including [[Lewes Castle]], the remains of [[Lewes Priory]], Bull House (the former home of [[Tom Paine]]), Southover Grange and public gardens, and a 16th century timber-framed [[Wealden hall house]] known as [[Anne of Cleves House]] because it was given to her as part of her divorce settlement from [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], though she never lived there. Anne of Cleves House and the castle are owned and maintained by the [[Sussex Archaeological Society]] (whose headquarters are in Lewes). The Round House, a secluded former [[windmill]] in Pipe Passage, was owned by the writer [[Virginia Woolf]].

The steep and cobbled Keere Street is home to many historic buildings, including a [[timber framed]] antiquarian bookshop. The gardens of the buildings on the east side of the street border the old Town Walls. The [[George IV of England|Prince Regent]] once drove his [[carriage]] down the street, and a sign at the bottom commemorates this event.

[[File:The Fifteenth Century Bookshop.JPG|thumb|right|The Fifteenth Century Bookshop, on the corner of High Street and Keere Street]]
The ancient street pattern survives extensively as do a high proportion of the medieval building plots and oak framed houses, albeit often masked with later facades. The 18th century frontages are notable and include several, like Bartholomew House at the Castle Gate, that are clad in [[mathematical tile]]s which mimic fine brick construction. Numerous streets of 18th and 19th century cottages have survived cycles of '[[slum clearance]]' as models of attractive town housing.

At the highest point of the old town the [[Portland stone]] and [[Coade stone]] facade of the [[Lewes Crown Court|Crown Court]] (1808–12, by [[John Johnson (architect, born 1732)|John Johnson]]), the brick Market Tower and florid [[Lewes War Memorial]] mark the historic centre, although trade has tended to concentrate on the lower land in modern times. At the lowest part of the town, by the river, [[Harvey &amp; Son]]'s Brewery, 'The Cathedral of Lewes' is an unspoilt 19th century tower brewery and is the only one of the town's five original major breweries still in use. Nearby Fitzroy House&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Plaque on Fitzroy House| url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/1308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[George Gilbert Scott]] designed building, constructed as a library in memory of Lewes MP [[Henry Fitzroy (statesman)]] in 1862 and now a private residence. The railway station is the other important monument of the industrial era.

[[File:Thomas Paines Lewes home.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Bull House: Thomas Paine's home]]
Southover Grange is a [[Listed building|grade II* listed]] Tudor manor house built in 1572 with [[Caen limestone]] taken from the ruins of [[Lewes Priory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1192300 | title=SOUTHOVER GRANGE - 1192300 - Historic England | publisher=[[Historic England]] | accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house and its gardens were bought by Lewes District Council and opened to the public in 1945. The house is now owned by [[East Sussex County Council]], and it is currently being refurbished into a wedding venue, registry office and community facility. The east wing is leased to an art shop and the Window café (open in spring and summer). The Grange gardens are divided by the Winterbourne stream and contain formal bedding displays, a wildflower area, a knot garden and some notable trees, including a large [[Magnolia grandiflora]], a [[mulberry tree]] dating perhaps to the 17th century and a [[tulip tree]] planted by [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. The gardens are open to the public during daylight hours all year round.
[[Image:Keere Street, Lewes.JPG|thumb|right|Keere Street]]

Pelham House dates back to the 16th century and features architecture of all subsequent eras and a private landscaped garden facing the Downs. It now serves as an independent hotel. The Shelleys, also now a hotel, is likewise of some antiquity with a private garden and family associations with [[Percy Shelley]].

The centre of Lewes is notable for a consistently high calibre of regional vernacular architecture and variety of historic construction materials and techniques. A comprehensive survey of all historical plaques was conducted in 2013 by a local civic society, the Friends of Lewes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://friendsoflewes.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/lewes_plaques_and_photos_asj_150124.pdf |publisher=Friends of Lewes |title=Lewes Historical Plaque |access-date=4 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204122826/https://friendsoflewes.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/lewes_plaques_and_photos_asj_150124.pdf |archive-date=4 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinctive feature of the centre of Lewes is the network of alleyways or 'twittens' which run north-south on either side of the High Street and date back to Anglo-Saxon times. According to the Dictionary of the Sussex dialect and collection of provincialisms in use in the county of Sussex published in Lewes in 1875. "Twitten is a narrow path between two walls or hedges, especially on hills. For example, small passageways leading between two buildings to courtyards, streets, or open areas behind". Some twittens (eg Broomans Lane, Church Twitten, Green Lane, Paine's Twitten) remain flint-wall-lined pedestrian thoroughfares, others (eg Watergate Lane, St Andrew's Lane and renamed Station Street (formerly St Mary's Lane)) are now narrow usually one-way roads. The most notable of all Lewes' twittens is Keere Street. A weekly Sunday morning run up and down all the twittens on the south side of the High Street - the so-called Twitten Run - has operated in the town since November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://friends-of-lewes.org.uk/2012/10/30/kim-clark-lewes-street-names-and-twittens/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public sculpture==

===Historic===

With [[Eric Gill]]'s move to Ditchling, the artistic community there gave rise to other sculptors in the Lewes district such as his nephew [[John Skelton (sculptor)|John Skelton]] and [[Joseph Cribb]]. Skelton's studio in [[Streat]] has continued as an educational and artist's workshop since his death in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skeltonworkshops.co.uk/|title=Skelton Workshops|work=Skelton Workshops}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Gill]] and [[Jacob Epstein]] conceived ''a great scheme for doing some collossal figures together'' around 1910 for a modern Stonehenge on 6 acres of land at Asheham House, [[Beddingham]], south-east of Lewes. [[William Rothenstein]] agreed to buy the lease but the scheme failed.&lt;ref&gt;Vorticism and Abstract Art in the First Machine Age, Volume 1, By Richard Cork p.117&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Perry Warren]] first saw Lewes House in 1889 and with his partner John Marshall they were prodigious collectors of fine antique sculpture there. [[Eric Gill]] was introduced to Warren by [[Roger Fry]] and the stone carving Ecstasy purchased, which is now in the [[Tate Gallery]] collection. [[William Rothenstein]] suggested that Warren might like to acquire [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]'s new sculpture ''[[The Kiss (Rodin sculpture)|The Kiss]]'' and after several visits, in 1904 the Lewes ''Kiss'' arrived at Lewes House. In 1906 Rodin requested that Warren lend ''The Kiss'' to an important exhibition in Regent Street, London. This made it famous in Britain for the first time. ''The Kiss'' was returned to the stables at Lewes House, where it remained until 1914 until offered to Lewes Town Council. It was placed in the Town Hall, at the South End of the Assembly Room on 2 December 1914. Early in 1915, ''The Kiss'' was wrapped in canvas and marked off with a guard rail. The Town Council returned the statue, saying only that the room did 'not lend itself to such a noble piece of statuary.' On 26 February 1917, ''The Kiss'' was once more taken to the stable block where it was to remain until Warren's death in 1928. After a short period on loan to Cheltenham, ''The Kiss'' was purchased in 1953 by public subscription and is now one of the Tate's most popular attractions.

It returned on loan to Lewes in 1999 for the exhibition ''Rodin in Lewes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hqinfo.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/jm-archive-rodin-in-lewes.html|title=The Generalist|work=hqinfo.blogspot.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present day===
''The Helmet'' (1964), by [[Enzo Plazzotta]] stands in the grounds of Lewes Priory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicsculpturesofsussex.co.uk/object?id=75|title=Object Details|work=publicsculpturesofsussex.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Cuilfail Spiral'' (1983) by [[Peter Randall-Page]] sits on the roundabout at the north end of the Cuilfail Tunnel; made of 7 pieces of Portland limestone. The ''Magnus Inscription'', (c. 1200) sits in the East wall of St John Sub Castro on the Junction of Abinger Place and Lancaster Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicsculpturesofsussex.co.uk/object?id=246|title=Object Details|work=publicsculpturesofsussex.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Janus Head'' (1997) by [[John Skelton (sculptor)|John Skelton]] and ''Lewes Group'' (2010) by [[Jon Edgar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sussexexpress.co.uk/news/local/lewes-set-to-host-giant-sculpture-by-jon-edgar-1-4880608|title=Lewes set to host giant sculpture by Jon Edgar|work=sussexexpress.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; sit in Southover Grange Gardens.

==Transport==

[[File:LewesStation Big.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lewes railway station]], looking east. South Downs in the distance]]
Lewes, from its inception, has been an important transport hub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=56908 |title=‘’British History Online‘’ |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |date=22 June 2003 |accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its site as a bridging point was probably originally a ford: today the main routes avoid the town centre. The [[A27 road|A27 trunk road]] taking traffic along the south coast between [[Eastbourne]] and [[Southampton]] passes to the south of the town. The [[A26 road|A26]] from [[Maidstone]] to Newhaven; and the [[A275 road|A275]] (the London road) both come in from the north. The [[Brighton &amp; Hove (bus company)|Brighton &amp; Hove]] bus company and [[Compass Travel]] serve the town. The bus station was closed for a while but reopened in late 2008.

[[Lewes railway station]] was originally the junction for six routes. The town still enjoys hourly fast trains from [[London]]. The two erstwhile rural rail routes to the north, linking to [[East Grinstead]] and [[Uckfield]] respectively, are both now closed, but the [[East Coastway Line]], connecting Brighton with Eastbourne and [[Hastings]], and the branch to [[Seaford, East Sussex|Seaford]] remain.

The [[Vanguard Way]], a [[long-distance trail|long-distance footpath]] from London to Newhaven, passes through countryside east of the town. The [[South Downs Way]] also passes close to Lewes, crossing the Ouse at [[Southease]], some four miles south of the town. A festival celebrating and encouraging walking and cycling, the Lewes Hike and Bike Festival, was created in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leweshikeandbike.co.uk/ |title=‘’Lewes Hike and Bike Festival‘’ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609024101/http://www.leweshikeandbike.co.uk/ |archivedate=9 June 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western Road and Southover School, despite being separate schools, are housed in linked buildings. The original Southover buildings are of red brick in the Queen Anne style, dating back to the early 20th century. The additions to it now forming the Western Road buildings date from after 1945. The two schools share a field.

==Notable people==
{{Main|List of people from Lewes, East Sussex}}
Among the many notable former residents of Lewes is [[Thomas Paine]] (1737–1809), who was employed as an [[HM Customs and Excise|excise officer]] in the town for a time from 1768 to 1774 when he emigrated to the American colonies. The Paine association sits at the centre of a radical tradition that is represented today by writers working in the town.{{Citation needed|reason=who?|date=April 2009}}

The sciences and natural enquiry are represented by [[Gideon Mantell]] who is credited with the first discovery and identification of fossilised dinosaur ([[iguanodon]]) teeth. Lewes doctor [[Richard Russell (doctor)|Richard Russell]] popularised the resort of [[Brighton]].

Lewes is the birthplace of 16th century madrigalist [[Nicholas Yonge]]. In the 1960s it was home to [[Charlie Watts]] of the [[Rolling Stones]], as it is now to other musicians, notably [[Herbie Flowers]], [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]] and [[Tim Rice-Oxley]] from [[Keane (band)|Keane]].

[[Daisy Ashford]] lived at Southdown House, 44 St Anne’s Crescent from 1889 to 1896 where she wrote ''[[The Young Visiters]]''. [[Edward Perry Warren]], an eccentric American collector, lived in Lewes House. In 1919 [[Virginia Woolf]] briefly owned – but never lived in – the Round House, a windmill in Pipe Passage, before moving to her final home, [[Monk's House]] in [[Rodmell]]. Diarist [[John Evelyn]] spent his boyhood at Southover Grange.

==Crime==
The fact that Lewes has a [[Lewes Crown Court|Crown Court]], and a [[Lewes (HM Prison)|prison]], is reflected by the fact that many notorious people have been connected with the town. During the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] in Ireland several prominent figures involved in it were in Lewes Prison, including  [[Éamon de Valera]]  (1882&amp;ndash;1975); [[Thomas Ashe]] (1885–1917); [[Frank Lawless]] (1871–1922); and [[Harry Boland]] (1887–1922). Others have included [[George Witton]] (1874–1942) involved in shooting prisoners during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]].

Lewes [[Assize Court|assizes]] saw many important trials. In 1949 [[serial killer]] [[John George Haigh]] was sentenced to death. In 1956 suspected serial killer [[John Bodkin Adams]] had his committal hearing in Lewes before being sent to the [[Old Bailey]], London for trial. He was subsequently tried and convicted in Lewes in 1957 for [[fraud]], lying on [[cremation]] forms and obstructing a police search. An early case was that of [[Percy Lefroy Mapleton]] (1860–1881) hanged for murder and the subject of the first composite picture on a [[wanted poster]].

==Twin towns==

Lewes is twinned with [[Waldshut-Tiengen]], Germany, since 1974 and with [[Blois]], France, since 1963, although informal links between these two towns began in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lewes Twinning Association|url=http://lewestwinning.weebly.com/history.html|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

One theory has it that the name '''Lewes''' comes from the plural form of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] "Hlaew", which means "hill".&lt;ref name=Whynne&gt;{{cite book | last=Whynne-Hammond | first=Charles | year=2007 | title=English Place-namesExplained | isbn=978-1-85306-911-6 | publisher=Countryside Books | page=229 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This refers to the hills of the [[South Downs]] or ancient burial mounds within the area; but ''A Dictionary of British Place Names''&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Mills (2011)|''A Dictionary of British Place Names'', A.D.Mills, O.U.P.&lt;/ref&gt; says that it derives "From the rare [[Old English|OE]] word ''lǣw'' ‘wound, incision’, here used in a topographical sense ‘gap’."

The '''Mt. Van Hoevenberg Olympic Bobsled Run''' is a venue for [[bobsleigh]], [[luge]] and [[skeleton (sport)|skeleton]] located at the [[Lake Placid Olympic Sports Complex]] in [[Lake Placid, New York]], [[United States]]. This venue was used for the [[1932 Winter Olympics|1932]] and [[1980 Winter Olympics]] and for the only winter [[Goodwill Games]] in 2000.  The third and most recent version of the track was completed in 2000 with the track hosting both the first [[FIBT World Championships]] and [[FIL World Luge Championships]] done outside of Europe, doing so in [[FIBT World Championships 1949|1949]]&lt;ref name=bob&gt;[http://sports123.com/bob/mw-2.html Bobsleigh two-man world championship medalists since 1931] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091333/http://sports123.com/bob/mw-2.html |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[FIL World Luge Championships 1983|1983]].&lt;ref name=luge&gt;[http://sports123.com/lug/mw-s.html FIL World Luge Championships men's single results since 1955] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218194001/http://sports123.com/lug/mw-s.html |date=2007-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010 the bobsled track was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

== History ==
[[File:Olympic Bobsled Run Lake Placid2.jpg|thumb|[[Works Progress Administration]] poster from the late 1930s to advertise public access to the [[bobsled]] run from the [[1932 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, New York]]]]
The bobsled track was built in 1930.&lt;ref name="nrhpreg"&gt;{{cite web |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Mt. Van Hoevenberg Olympic Bobsled Run |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/feature/weekly_features/OlympicBobsledRun.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |date=January 2009 |author=Kathleen LaFrank and Philip G. Wolf|publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=2010-05-16}} (46 pages, with maps and 10 photos from 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Park Service:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Carved out of wilderness and surrounded by forested land on all sides, the one and one-half mile long Olympic Bobsled Run was constructed in 1930 and built specifically for the 1932 Winter Olympic Games. The course was designed by Stanislaus Sentzytsky, a renowned German course designer, who designed a course that was radically different from its European counterparts. The Lake Placid course was longer, steeper, and featured a more pronounced drop in curves than European runs, which allowed for steadier driving and faster speeds than those obtained on prior bobsled events. After the American team won two gold medals and one silver in 1932, bobsledding, previously unknown in America, captivated the country’s interest, and U.S. teams dominated the sport until 1956. Although portions of the course have been retired, parts of the original Olympic Bobsled Run continue to be used for training and recreation.&lt;ref name=highlight&gt;{{cite web|title=Weekly Highlight 19 February 2010 Mt. Van Hoevenberg Olympic Bobsled Run, Essex County, New York | url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/feature/weekly_features/10_02_19_OlympicBobsledRun.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Mt. Van Hoevenberg Olympic Bobsled Run, the structure was listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]] on February 4, 2010.&lt;ref name="newlistings2010feb19"/&gt; The listing was announced as the featured listing in the [[National Park Service]]'s weekly list of February 19, 2010.&lt;ref name="featured"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/nrlist.htm |title=Weekly List Actions |accessdate=2010-05-16 |work= |publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[1932 Winter Olympics]], bobsleigh racing took place at the steep hill where the Intervales [[ski jumping|ski jump]] would eventually be located.&lt;ref name=owg32&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1932/1932w.pdf 1932 Winter Olympic Games official report.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410085042/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1932/1932w.pdf |date=2008-04-10 }} pp. 30, 39-41, 50-1, 157-66.&lt;/ref&gt; The attendees were delighted by the speeds of the [[bobsled]]s though several teams crashed during the run, sending two members of one team to the hospital as a result.&lt;ref name=owg32 /&gt; The Intervales track only lasted one season (1929–30).&lt;ref name=owg32 /&gt; Led by [[Henry Homburger]], the first track was surveyed and constructed during 1929-30 at [[Mount Van Hoevenberg]], located in the [[Whiteface Mountain]] area though it was in spite of protests of using state-owned lands for construction of the facility for environmental reasons.&lt;ref name=owg32 /&gt; After construction took place during August–December 1930, the track opened for use on [[Christmas]] Day 1930. This track was {{convert|2366|m|ft}} long with 26 curves with a vertical drop of {{convert|228|m|ft}}, and an average grade of 9.6%.&lt;ref name=owg32 /&gt;

After the 1932 games, the first {{convert|829|m|ft}} and ten curves of the track were eliminated, shortening the track's length to {{convert|1537|ft}} with 16 curves, and an average grade of 9.3%.&lt;ref name=bunk&gt;[http://www.bunksplace.com/hot%20runnings.html Bunksplace.com information on bobsleigh history: 1890-present.] - Accessed 15 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, the track became the first venue outside of Europe to host the [[FIBT World Championships]]&lt;ref name=bob /&gt; though it would start with tragic results when [[Belgium|Belgian]] bobsledder [[Max Houben]] was killed during a practice run off of "Shady" curve prior to the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,853670-1,00.html ''TIME'' magazine 7 March 1949 article about the Lake Placid, NY bobsleigh track that took Houbon's life] - Accessed 29 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Belgian team withdrew as a result.

It would be another [[FIBT World Championships 1961|twelve years]] before the track hosted another world championship following safety improvements to the track.&lt;ref name=bob /&gt; By this time, track officials had established a relationship with the [[International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation]] ([[FIBT]]).&lt;ref name=owg80a&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1980/orw1980v1.pdf 1980 Winter Olympic Games official report - Volume 1.] pp. 57-66. {{en icon}} &amp; {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sergio Zardini]]'s fatal crash at the "Zig-Zag curves" on 22 February 1966 would lead to further safety improvements.&lt;ref name=bunk /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,835216,00.html "The Deadly Zig-Zag". ''TIME''. 4 March 1966] - Accessed August 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[FIBT World Championships|world bobsleigh championships]] of [[FIBT World Championships 1969|1969]], [[FIBT World Championships 1973|1973]], and [[FIBT World Championships 1978|1978]], many race officials of those championships would serve on the organizing committee for the [[Bobsleigh at the 1980 Winter Olympics|bobsleigh part]] of the [[1980 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name=owg80a /&gt; In 1978 actual construction took place during September 1978-February 1979 with the creation of a [[reinforced concrete]], artificially [[refrigeration|refrigerated]] bobsleigh track.&lt;ref name=owg80a /&gt; The bobsleigh track was approved for competition in December 1979.&lt;ref name=owg80a /&gt; In fall 1977, a separate [[Luge at the 1980 Winter Olympics|luge track for the 1980 Games]], the first one in the [[United States]], was constructed with completion in time for the test competition in February 1979. During preparations for the 1980 Games, a combined two-man bobsleigh and luge track was considered, but abandoned to high cost and the track was redesigned with permission from the [[International Luge Federation]] (FIL).&lt;ref name=owg80a /&gt; Following the 1980 games, both tracks hosted their respective [[FIBT World Championships 1983|world championships]] &lt;ref name=bob /&gt; in [[FIL World Luge Championships 1983|1983]].&lt;ref name=luge /&gt; The 1932 track continued to be used strictly for passenger riding after the new combined track was sanctioned.

Skeleton racing debuted during the 1990s with the bobsleigh part of the track hosting the world championships in [[FIBT World Championships 1997|1997]].&lt;ref name=skeleton&gt;[http://sports123.com/ske/mw.html FIBT men's skeleton world championships results since 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111059/http://sports123.com/ske/mw.html |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1990s, parts of both tracks were demolished to make way for a new track that was constructed for the 2000 Winter Goodwill Games that was completed in January 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodwillgames.com/2000/2000_venuesMtVanHoev.html List of venues on Mt. Van Hoevenberg for the 2000 Winter Goodwill Games] - Accessed 16 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The track has been part of the [[Lake Placid Olympic Sports Complex]] since the end of the 1980 Winter Olympics as part of the [[Olympic Regional Development Authority]] (ORDA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orda.org/newsite/about.php About ORDA.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orda.org/newsite/togo/olympicsportscomplex.php ORDA profile on Lake Placid Olympic Sports Park.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, it has hosted the [[Chevrolet|Chevy]] [[Geoff Bodine]] Bobsled Challenge, an annual event which has [[NASCAR]] drivers take a run down the track to benefit the [[Bo-Dyn Bobsled Project]] (co-created by the former NASCAR driver and [[1986 Daytona 500]] winner) in use by the United States since the start of the [[1994 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name=bodine&gt;[http://www.bodynbobsled.com/ Bo-Dyn Bobsled Project official website]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the competition took place between NASCAR and the [[National Hot Rod Association]] (NHRA) which was won by [[Jeg Coughlin Jr.]] (NHRA) won the event.&lt;ref name=bodine /&gt; The 2010 event took place at the track 8–10 January with [[Melanie Troxel]] on the NHRA becoming the first woman to competes in the event.&lt;ref name=bodine /&gt;

In 2009, the track became the first to host bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton world championships in the same year in a non-Winter Olympic year (The [[Utah Olympic Park bobsleigh/luge/skeleton track|bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track]] in [[Park City, Utah]] was the first to do so for the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in neighboring [[Salt Lake City]]).&lt;ref name=wface&gt;[http://www.whiteface.com/facilities/osc_bob.php Whiteface.com information about the track.] - accessed 3 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6174">'''Performance Medicine''' is a sub-speciality of [[Clinical medicine|clinical]] and [[diagnostic medicine]] that is focussed on the optimisation of emotional, mental, and emotional well-being and performance. It is a new and innovative medical speciality that merges the goals of internal medicine, anti-ageing medicine, functional medicine, sports medicine and preventative health care. 

Performance medicine differs fundamentally from other areas of medicine by focusing on the healthy non-injured individual that is at low risk of sub-clinical or clinical disease. This population of individuals responds poorly to the current medical paradigm&lt;ref&gt;M. Roy, M. Levasseur, Y. Couturier, B. Lindström, and M. Généreux, “The relevance of positive approaches to health for patient-centered care medicine,” Preventive Medicine Reports, vol. 2, pp. 10–12, Jan. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;. It uses the principles of evidence-based medicine not to treat disease, but optimise function to reacher higher levels of well-being and performance&lt;ref&gt;B. S. McEWEN, “Stress, Adaptation, and Disease: Allostasis and Allostatic Load,” Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, vol. 840, no. 1, pp. 33–44, Feb. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;. This is the medical analog to the field of [[Positive psychology|positive psychology]], which uses the scientific principles of psychology not to treat mental disease, but to increase life satisfaction.

The aims of Performance medicine are to increase the bodies ability to resist, postpone or prevent disease and/or injury.&lt;ref&gt;[[Preventive medicine]]&lt;/ref&gt; and maximise human performance in terms of adaptive capacity, endurance,&lt;ref&gt;[[Endurance]]&lt;/ref&gt; and physical fitness,&lt;ref&gt;[[Physical fitness]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Performance medicine physicians aim to measure the capacity and interaction of the bodies functional systems over time and to modify exposure to environmental factors in such a way that an individuals health is optimised by operating at the "sweet spot" where both performance and longevity are maximimised. This is achieved through an increased [[adaptive capacity]], which is the bodies ability to turn [[stressors]] into growth opportunities.


'''The goals of performance medicine have been summarised and include the following:
'''
# a focus on maintaining and increasing an individuals adaptive capacity throughout adult life
# the maximisation of an individuals [[Metabolic pathway|metabolic efficiency]]
# the adoption of strategies that increase an individuals resistance to disease and postpone or [[Preventive medicine|prevent disease]] where possible


== Improving Well-Being ==
An organisms adaptive capacity determines its ability to adapt to new stressors&lt;ref&gt;B. S. McEwen, “Chapter 5 - Central Role of the Brain in Stress and Adaptation: Allostasis, Biological Embedding, and Cumulative Change,” in Stress: Concepts, Cognition, Emotion, and Behavior, G. Fink, Ed. San Diego: Academic Press, 2016, pp. 39–55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McEwen BS, “Allostasis and the epigenetics of brain and body health over the life course: The brain on stress,” JAMA Psychiatry, vol. 74, no. 6, pp. 551–552, Jun. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;. Performance Medicine aims to increase an individuals adaptive capacity via functional improvements of the immune system, nervous system, hormonal system, and digestive system&lt;ref&gt;B. S. Oken, I. Chamine, and W. Wakeland, “A systems approach to stress, stressors and resilience in humans,” Behavioural Brain Research, vol. 282, pp. 144–154, Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;. This increase adaptive capacity increases the ability of the individual to deal with stressors and thereby increases life satisfaction, as well as emotional, mental and physical functioning&lt;ref&gt;P. B. Badcock, C. G. Davey, S. Whittle, N. B. Allen, and K. J. Friston, “The Depressed Brain: An Evolutionary Systems Theory,” Trends in Cognitive Sciences, vol. 21, no. 3, pp. 182–194, Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. V. Sudakov, “The theory of functional systems: general postulates and principles of dynamic organization (dedicated to the Anokhin Centenary).,” Integr Physiol Behav Sci, vol. 32, no. 4, pp. 392–414, Dec. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Improving [[Adaptation]] in Athletes ==
The basis of Performance Medicine in improving [[athletic performance]] lies in the understanding that the functions of the [[immune system]], [[nervous system]], [[hormonal system]], and [[digestive system]] govern adaptation to training&lt;ref&gt;P. K. Anokhin, “Nodular Mechanism of Functional Systems as a Self-regulating Apparatus,” in Progress in Brain Research, vol. 22, E. A. Asratyan, Ed. Elsevier, 1968, pp. 230–251.&lt;/ref&gt;. All environmental stimuli (including training and nutrition) are processed by these systems, which will respond with adaptation, if their capacity permits. It is therefore the functions of these systems, which determine the result of all training stimuli&lt;ref&gt;K. V. Sudakov, “The theory of functional systems: general postulates and principles of dynamic organization (dedicated to the Anokhin Centenary).,” Integr Physiol Behav Sci, vol. 32, no. 4, pp. 392–414, Dec. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Morris, “The Effect of Fluid Periodization on Athletic Performance Outcomes in American Football Players,” p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Performance Medicine is to be clearly distinguished from sports science and sports coaching, which is mostly concerned with the optimal composition of training stimuli. In Performance Medicine the main concern is the functional status of the athlete's adaptive systems&lt;ref&gt;K. V. Sudakov, “The theory of functional systems: general postulates and principles of dynamic organization (dedicated to the Anokhin Centenary).,” Integr Physiol Behav Sci, vol. 32, no. 4, pp. 392–414, Dec. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4168">The '''''Premio internazionale Giacinto Facchetti''''' ("''Il bello del calcio''") is a recognition established in 2006 awarded annually to a football personality for their honesty, correct behaviour, fair-play, and sportsmanship by the [[Milan]]-based Italian sports newspaper ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]''.

==History==
The prize was conceived in 2006 by the newspaper's former director [[Candido Cannavò]] and the newspaper's director at the time [[Carlo Verdelli]], in honour of the late [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] defender [[Giacinto Facchetti]], following his death earlier that year on 4 September.&lt;ref name="Giacinto Facchetti"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lastoriasiamonoi.rai.it/biografie/giacinto-facchetti/51/default.aspx|title=Giacinto Facchetti|language=Italian|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Giacinto Facchetti|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/sep/11/guardianobituaries.football|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction is awarded annually to a football personality who, like Facchetti, has stood out for their honesty, correct behaviour, fair-play, and sportsmanship.&lt;ref name="Il bello del calcio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Squadre/Inter/10-11-2012/a-zanetti-premio-facchetti-bello-calcio-capitano-913172226064.shtml|title=Zanetti nel nome di Facchetti Il bello del calcio è il Capitano|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian|author1=Azzurra Saggini|date=10 November 2012|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Prix de Guiche''' is a [[Group races|Group&amp;nbsp;3]] [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in [[France]] open to three-year-old [[thoroughbred]] [[Colt (horse)|colts]]. It is run over a distance of 1,800&amp;nbsp;metres (about 1⅛&amp;nbsp;miles) at [[Chantilly Racecourse|Chantilly]] in May.

==History==
The event is named after [[Antoine-Geneviève-Héraclius-Agénor de Gramont|Antoine&amp;nbsp;IX]] (1789–1855), the Duc de Guiche (and later [[Duke of Gramont|Duc de Gramont]]), who founded the successful Haras de Meudon stud farm.

The Prix de Guiche was established in 1865, and it was originally held at [[Longchamp Racecourse|Longchamp]]. It was usually contested over 2,000&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 1868 Prix de Guiche | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5-UNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA322&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U0UeISUSXOwCI7xRae-MMLAJHY11w&amp;ci=37%2C250%2C483%2C247&amp;edge=0 | work = Ruff's Guide to the Turf for 1869 | accessdate = 1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was cancelled because of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1871. It was run over 2,200&amp;nbsp;metres in 1873.

The race was abandoned throughout World War&amp;nbsp;I, with no running from 1915 to 1918. It was staged at [[Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse|Maisons-Laffitte]] in 1944 and 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Aujourd'hui à Maisons-Laffitte | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/proxy?method=R&amp;ark=bpt6k5879961.f4&amp;l=5&amp;r=1484,1900,239,307 | newspaper = [[Le Matin (France)|Le Matin]] | date = 1 April 1944 | accessdate = 1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was cut to 1,950&amp;nbsp;metres in 1953.

With the exception of four editions over 1,850&amp;nbsp;metres (1963 and 1965–67), the event continued over 1,950&amp;nbsp;metres until 1986. It reverted to 1,850&amp;nbsp;metres in 1987. It was transferred to Chantilly and shortened to 1,800&amp;nbsp;metres in 2005.

The Prix de Guiche can serve as a trial for the [[Prix du Jockey Club]]. Fifteen horses have won both races. The first was Consul in 1869, and the most recent was [[Almanzor (horse)|Almanzor]] in 2016.

'''Savannah Dragway''' was an eighth-mile {{nowrap|(200 m)}} [[dragstrip]] used by the [[NHRA]] located near in [[Savannah, Georgia]]. The track opened as a quarter-mile {{nowrap|(400 m)}} facility in 1968, but safety concerns and rising insurance costs caused it to convert to the smaller distance in the mid-1980s. They were forced to close down at the end of 2005, this was because a neighbour filed many noise complaints and also because their lease expired.

An eighth-mile track called "Savannah River Dragway" opened in 2006 in [[Screven County]]. It is further from Savannah, {{convert|50|mi|km}} northwest of the old Savannah Dragway location.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2334">[[File:spaldeen.jpg|thumb|230px|Modern-day Spaldeen]]
A '''Spalding Hi-Bounce Ball''', often called a '''Spaldeen''', is a rubber ball, the size of a [[tennis ball]] without the felt. It was the more expensive and more popular version of the Pensie Pinkie (made by [[Penn Racquet Sports]]). These balls are commonly used in [[street game]]s developed in the mid-20th century, such as [[Chinese handball]] (a variation on [[American handball]]),  [[stoop ball]], hit-the-penny (involving trying to make a penny flip on a sidewalk), [[butts up]], [[handball (school)|handball]], [[punchball]], [[half-rubber]], and [[stickball]] (a variation of [[baseball]]).

==Name==
The term arose from a [[New York City]]-accented pronunciation of [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]], the [[sporting goods]] company that produced the balls. The name has become so common that Spalding now uses it in marketing, and it is now a [[registered trademark]].&lt;ref name="Dodgers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/13/business/yourmoney/the-spaldeen-is-back-even-if-the-dodgers-arent.html|title=The Spaldeen Is Back (Even if the Dodgers Aren't)|date=13 March 2005|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Spaldeens were popular with children from the 1930s through to the 1970s. In [[urban area]]s sparse in grass, Spaldeens became integral to many street games due to their bounciness and light weight. Citing the declining popularity of stickball, Spalding took the ball off the market in 1979, but it returned in 1999 to much fanfare.&lt;ref name="Dodgers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/05/nyregion/new-life-for-old-favorite-spaldeen-stickball-s-bouncy-foundation-makes-comeback.html|title=New Life for an Old Favorite; The Spaldeen, Stickball's Bouncy Foundation, Makes a Comeback|date=5 May 1999|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colors==
Since its return in 1999 Spaldeens have been manufactured in a variety of colors in addition to [[pink]]. Some of them are [[black]], [[blue]], [[green]], [[orange (color)|orange]], [[purple]], [[red]], and [[yellow]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1819">St. Louis, Missouri was without a convention center for 3 years following the 1904 World’s Fair. A  group of businessmen led by Attorney Guy Golterman assembled $450,000 private,  and built the Coliseum at Washington and Jefferson. It was designed by Frederick C. Bonsack, And  occupied a full block. When the [[cornerstone]] was laid on August 22, 1908, it was claimed the building would be the largest public building in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1908/08/23/104749544.pdf Lay Conerstone of St. Louis Coliseum - New York Times - August 23, 1908]&lt;/ref&gt;  It replaced the [[St. Louis Exposition and Music Hall]] as the city's main convention and big entertainment center. Golterman was the Secretary to the Company and  first manager of the Coliseum. Colonel Pickering managed it for a period of time.

The building accommodated  the 1916 Democratic nominating convention, wrestling and boxing matches, trade shows, and musical extravaganzas. Enrico Caruso performed in the Coliseum twice-first with the Metropolitan Opera Co. In April 1910, and again in May 1919, giving a Concert for Liberty Loans. Lack of parking, the emergence of neighborhood swimming pools, and

[[Kiel Auditorium]] which opened in 1934 effectively ‘did it in. It was closed in 1939 , and it was condemned as unsafe by the city in 1953.

A '''twizzle''' is a multirotational one-foot turn in [[figure skating]].&lt;ref name=YahooSportsFeb172014&gt;{{cite web|last=Eric|first=Freeman|title=What's a twizzle? Here's a guide to the figure skating term|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/olympics-fourth-place-medal/what-s-a-twizzle--here-s-a-guide-to-the-figure-skating-term-024737991.html|publisher=[[Yahoo! Sports]]|accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twizzle is most commonly seen in [[ice dancing]], where it appears in a number of [[Compulsory dance|Pattern Dances]] (originally called Compulsory Dance) and is a required element of step sequences in the [[short dance]], [[original dance]] and [[free dance (figure skating)|free dance]].&lt;ref name=YahooSportsFeb172014 /&gt;  A twizzle is also common in [[synchronized skating]] where it is also a required element of step sequences.

A twizzle differs from a [[Figure skating spins|figure skating spin]] in that it travels across the ice instead of being centered in one spot. Skaters can turn several revolutions on a twizzle, the number of which depends on the level at which they are skating or what is set in the specified steps of a Pattern Dance; as defined by the ISU Technical Committee of the relevant discipline. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is the Difference Between Twizzles and Spins in Figure Skating?|url = http://figureskating.about.com/od/glossarylettert/g/twizzles.htm|accessdate = 2015-10-06|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150406130638/http://figureskating.about.com/od/glossarylettert/g/twizzles.htm|archivedate = 2015-04-06|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twizzles can be performed both forward and backward, on both inside and outside edges, and both clockwise and counterclockwise.&lt;ref name=YahooSportsFeb172014 /&gt;  Twizzles are most commonly performed in an upright position with the free foot held close to the skating leg, but other variants are possible as well, such as a twizzle in a [[sit spin]] position.

Speed, ice coverage i.e. distance, unison (couples), closeness (couples), variety and difficulty of positions, change of rotational direction (counter-clockwise, clockwise), and difficult entries are taken into consideration by the judges and technical specialists.

'''Workable Football Club''' ({{zh|t=華家堡足球會}}) was a [[Hong Kong]] [[Association football|football]] club, played in [[Hong Kong First Division League]] in the 2007–08 season.

==History==

The team got the 1st Runner-up in [[Hong Kong Third A Division League]] in 2005–06 season and qualified into [[Hong Kong Third Division League|Third Division League Final Round]] to fight for 2 promotion positions among 4 teams. Shek Kip Mei topped the table and was promoted to [[Hong Kong Second Division League|Second Division]].

After the promotion, the team added a few former-[[Hong Kong national football team]] players to strengthen the team for a further promotion to the [[Hong Kong First Division League|First Division]]. The team finished second in the second division in the 2006–07 season and has been promoted to the First Division League in 2007–08.

After the promotion, the team obtained an [[HK$]]4,000,000 naming sponsorship from Workable Corporation and was named as Workable Football Club to compete in First Division League. The team released all the promotion heroes in Shek Kip Mei and obtained a few players from the extinct [[Hong Kong 08]] as the stem of team construction.

They played its debut match in First Division League on 8 September 2007, drawing 2–2 with [[Wofoo Tai Po]] in [[Mong Kok Stadium]]. The match is also highlighted by that current Workable manager [[Chan Hiu Ming]] is the head coach of [[Wofoo Tai Po]] in the previous season.
