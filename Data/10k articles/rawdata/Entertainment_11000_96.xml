'''''Berdjoang''''' (literally "struggle", also known under the title '''''Hope of the South''''') is a 1943 film from the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese-occupied]] [[Dutch East Indies]] (now Indonesia). The film, produced by the Japanese studio Nippon Eigasha, is credited as having been directed by [[Rd. Ariffien]], although Ariffien may have actually served as an assistant. Starring [[Mohamad Mochtar]], Sambas, [[Dhalia]], [[Kartolo]], and Chatir Harro, it follows several villagers and their different approaches to Japanese military rule. The [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|propaganda film]] was meant to draw [[native Indonesians|Indonesians]] to enter a Japanese-sponsored army and survives, in part, in the Netherlands.

== Plot ==
In Legok, a Japanese spokesman gives a speech regarding the formation of military units for [[native Indonesians]]. Two village boys, the best friends Saman (Sambas) and Anang ([[Mohamad Mochtar]]), try to join the army. Saman is not accepted owing to a lame leg, but Anang begins training. Saman, meanwhile, begins working indirectly for the Japanese occupation government by taking up work at a food company.

While Anang is away, the university-educated Ahmad (Chatir Harro), a fellow villager, express interest in Anang's girlfriend, Saman's sister Hasanah (Dahlia). Hasanah is not interested as she considers him ill-mannered and lazy. She tells him he should join the army, something Ahmad refuses to do. Saman, who has proven himself with his diligence, is promoted and eventually marries his boss's daughter, Nani (R.A. Pulunggana).

One day, Anang&amp;nbsp;– now a unit leader&amp;nbsp;– returns to the village with several of his men. He sees that Saman has been unable to join the army and thus apologises, as he considers their actions as children responsible for Saman's injuries. Their discussion is interrupted by cries of "Thief!" from outside; they rush out and see that Ahmad has been caught stealing from Saman's factory. Although Saman hits Ahmad several times, he refuses to press charges against the thief. Anang then takes his leave to go back to the army.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=340}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=342}}

== Production ==
The [[Empire of Japan]] began [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|occupying]] the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now Indonesia) in early 1942. The country's film industry was essentially shut down: all but one film studio was closed. The Japanese film studio Nippon Eigasha established a branch in the Indies.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=319, 332}} This was the company which produced ''Berdjoang''.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=340}} The film was one of several [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|Japanese propaganda films]] produced during the period; ''Berjoang'' was aimed at enticing Indonesians to join the army.{{sfn|Beeldengeluid.nl, Berdjoang}}

''Berdjoang'' was produced by the Japanese-sponsored Nippon Eigasha. It is credited as having been written and directed by [[Rd. Ariffien]],{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Berdjoang}} but the Indonesian film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] suggests that a Japanese man named Kurata Bunjin was the actual director, with Rd. Ariffien as his assistant.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=340}} It starred Mohamad Mochtar, Sambas, [[Dhalia]], [[Kartolo]], and Chatir Harro. Hajopan Bajo Angin was artistic director.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Berdjoang}} The [[black-and-white]] film had Indonesian and Japanese-language dialogue.{{sfn|Beeldengeluid.nl, Berdjoang}} Filming started on 1 September 1943,{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=340}} with Siat Yu Ming on camera.{{sfn|Beeldengeluid.nl, Berdjoang}}

The film departed from the rising [[intellectualism|intellectual]] movement of works produced domestically in 1940 and 1941; these films had shown university students, depicted by well-educated actors, as heroes, while ''Berdjoang'' relegated the intellectual elite to the realm of petty criminals.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=342}}

== Release and reception ==
''Berdjoang'' was released in 1943.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Berdjoang}} It was the only domestically-produced [[feature film]] released in the Dutch East Indies; Nippon Eigasha and Persafi did, however, make five [[short film]]s as well as several [[newsreel]]s before the [[Japanese surrender]]ed in August 1945.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=386–387}}{{sfn|YIDFF, Indonesia}}

The film is one of several Japanese propaganda films have survived, in whole or in part, at the [[Netherlands Government Information Service]].{{sfn|Beeldengeluid.nl, Berdjoang}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=351}} A ten-minute reel, thought to be the fourth [[Act (drama)|act]], was discovered in [[Jakarta]] and brought to the Netherlands, where it is now stored at the [[Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision]].{{sfn|Beeldengeluid.nl, Berdjoang}} This extract was screened at the 1997 [[Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival]], during a feature on Japanese newsreels and other productions during the occupation of the Indies.{{sfn|YIDFF, Indonesia}}

'''''Castlevania: Curse of Darkness'''''{{efn|Known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Akumajō Dracula: Yami no Juin'''''|悪魔城ドラキュラ 闇の呪印|Akumajō Dorakyura Yami no Juin|lit. ''Devil's Castle Dracula: Curse of Darkness''}}}} [[action-adventure game|action adventure game]] developed by [[Konami]] for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. Despite development for both [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], only the PlayStation 2 version was released in Japan. An Xbox version was released throughout Asia under the NTSC-J Format, with [[English language]] dialogue. A manga adaptation was also published by [[Tokyopop]].

==Gameplay==
Being a [[3-D computer graphics|3D]] game like ''[[Castlevania: Lament of Innocence|Lament of Innocence]]'' before it, ''Curse of Darkness'' differs from its predecessor in a number of ways. It includes a more complex, [[action game|action]]/[[adventure game|adventure]] style of gameplay, much like ''Symphony of the Night'' and ''Aria of Sorrow''. Hector is not a member of the Belmont clan, so he does not use the [[Vampire Killer whip|"Vampire Killer" whip]]; instead he has the ability (much like [[Alucard (Castlevania)|Alucard]] and [[Soma Cruz]]) to equip a variety of different weapons ranging from swords (both one handed and two handed), spears, axes (also both one handed and two handed), brass knuckles and an extra type called special weapons (which varies from tonfas to gatling guns). However, there is an extra gameplay mode after finishing the game that allows players to play as [[List of Castlevania characters#Trevor C. Belmont|Trevor Belmont]], equipped with the "Vampire Killer" and the subweapons which are the knife, axe, holy water, cross, and stopwatch. The battle system is somewhat similar to that of [[Dynasty Warriors]], whereas one button is used for standard combo attacks, and a secondary button is used for stronger "finishing attacks" after a singular standard attack or a combo of standard attacks. As the player acquires progressively stronger weapons throughout the game, the number of standard and finishing attacks the player can perform increases accordingly. Each different weapon type has a different set of combos that can be performed.

Departing from the central hub level layout of ''Lament of Innocence'', wherein the player chooses from a number of distinct stages all accessible from a central hallway, ''Curse of Darkness'' features a more complete game world with a complete castle map as in ''Symphony of the Night''. However, the game still uses the same map engine as ''Lament of Innocence'', rather than the square-based grid of 2D Castlevanias. Furthermore, a noticeable difference in level design is that much of the game does not take place in Dracula's castle, but rather exploring forests, mountains, temples, aqueducts, ruins, and villages in Europe. The player will be also aided by "Innocent Devils", which are demonic creatures developed by Hector himself through the Devil Forgery skill, in order to defeat enemies and solve puzzles within the game. They're similar to Alucard's Familiars in ''Symphony of the Night'', however they level up and evolve together with Hector. The Innocent Devils (commonly referred as I.D.'s) come in 6 different types. Each I.D. gives specifics bonuses to Hector's stats.

In PS2 version only, the player can get the Moai statue. This item can only be obtained if the player has a cleared save file of Castlevania: Lament of Innocence on their memory card. Conversely, load times are faster in the Xbox version.

==Plot==

===Setting===

''Curse of Darkness'' is set in the year 1479, three years after the events of ''[[Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse]]''.  Though defeated by vampire hunter [[List of Castlevania characters#Trevor C. Belmont|Trevor Belmont]], [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula's]] curse continues to ravage the European countryside, spreading disease, mob violence, and heresy in its wake. Amidst all this devastation is Hector, a Devil Forgemaster who had formerly worked under the employ of Dracula but betrayed him sometime during the events of ''Castlevania III''. Eventually growing disgusted with Dracula's brutal methods, Hector leaves Castlevania and relinquishes his powers to live amongst humans, settling down to live a peaceful life. When Hector's fiancée Rosaly is accused of witchcraft and burned at the stake, Hector learns that her murder was directed by his rivalrous Devil Forgemaster, Isaac. Seeking revenge, Hector chases his former colleague back to his old home, and back to the demonic life he believed he had left behind him.

===Story===

When the game begins, Hector arrives at an Abandoned Castle to confront Isaac. The latter scoffs at his desire for revenge and dares him to regain his powers so they can settle their score in a satisfying way. Hector reluctantly accepts the challenge, and starts hunting his former friend across the Transylvanian countryside. During his quest, he encounters several people: Julia Laforeze, a young witch in exile who turns out to be Isaac's sister, Trevor Belmont, who distrusts him for being a Devil Forgemaster, Zead, a kindly holyman who provides him with reliable information about Isaac's whereabouts, and [[Count of St Germain|St. Germain]], a mysterious time traveller who presses him to abandon his quest, but eventually leaves him alone with some cryptic comments about a "new destiny" having emerged for him.

At one point, Trevor decides to trust Hector, and uses his own blood to unlock a parallel world called the Infinite Corridor, where Isaac is supposedly hiding. However, when Hector fights a Dullahan there, an evil glyph channels his energy and uses it to summon a new incarnation of Dracula's castle. Isaac, who intended this all along, cruelly stabs Trevor and leaves him for dead.

Hector enters the new Castlevania, where he fights and defeats his nemesis. As he prepares to kill him in a fit of rage, he suddenly remembers Julia, who had warned him not to let the Curse take hold of him. Horrified, Hector realizes that his actions are being controlled by Dracula's Curse. A triumphant Zead appears and confirms this, explaining that the Devil Forgemasters were supposed to fight to the death, with the blood-stained Hector becoming the vessel for the Count's reincarnation. Having secured Isaac's body for this purpose, he reveals himself to be Death and attacks, in vain. Hector proceeds to fight Dracula, who is unable to take full control of Isaac's body and returns to the afterlife. Hector then uses his powers as a Devil Forgemaster to lift the Curse. Julia comes to his rescue, and they start a new life together. Meanwhile, St. Germain departs for the distant future, wondering how the struggle between mankind and Dracula will end.

==Development==
It was produced by [[Koji Igarashi]] (also known as ''IGA''), who has worked on several other games in the ''[[Castlevania]]'' series, including ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'', ''[[Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow]]'' and ''[[Castlevania: Lament of Innocence]]''. Also returning are series artist [[Ayami Kojima]] and composer [[Michiru Yamane]].

===Audio===
Michiru Yamane once again composes the music. Guitars, which were omitted from Lament of Innocence's score, have returned in Curse of Darkness. There was a sampler given away as a bonus to anyone who pre-ordered a copy of Castlevania: Curse of Darkness from supporting retailers.

[[Animaze]] has done the [[English language]]-voicework for the Characters.

The game was generally well received, generating mid to high review scores. Common praises often go to the game's battle system – which as stated by IGN "...can offer up a fairly wide variety of skirmishes and strategies..." -, the Innocent Devil system and musical score. Common criticisms of the game go to the game's environments, which have generally been considered dull and repetitive. [[X-Play]] gave Curse of Darkness a 3 out of 5 while IGN gave it a 7.8, or "Good" rating.&lt;ref name=IGN&gt;{{cite web | author=Roper, Chris| date= October 31, 2005| title=Castlevania: Curse of Darkness | work=ign.com | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/662/662769p1.html | accessdate=2006-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GamePro]] Magazine gave the game a 4.0 out of a 5.0 fun factor, stating that it was a game that got more intriguing as it goes on. [[GameSpot]] rated it 6.8, saying it looked good and had solid controls, but the level design was "monotonous".&lt;ref name=GameSpot&gt;{{cite web | author=Greg Kasavin| date= November 1, 2005| title=Castlevania: Curse of Darkness | format= | work=GameSpot.com | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/castlevaniacurseofdarkness/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary;review | accessdate=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Tim Turi felt that it was "decent" but did not feel like it captured the "overall style and atmosphere" of other ''Castlevania'' games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ranking The Castlevania Bloodline |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/04/04/ranking-the-castlevania-bloodline.aspx |work=[[Game Informer]] |last=Turi |first=Tim |date=2012-04-04 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manga===
Adapted and illustrated by Kou Sasakura, a two-volume manga adaptation titled {{nihongo|''Castlevania: Curse of Darkness''|悪魔城ドラキュラ 闇の呪印|''Akumajō Dorakyura: Yami no Juin''}} was published in Japan from 2005 to 2006.&lt;ref name="licensing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-03-12/tokyopop-adds-castlevania-curse-of-darkness-manga|title=Tokyopop Adds ''Castlevania: Curse of Darkness'' Manga|date=12 March 2008|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking place between the events of ''[[Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse]]'' and ''Castlevania: Curse of Darkness'', the manga centers on Isaac and Hector.&lt;ref name="PCS review"/&gt; [[Tokyopop]] licensed it for English-language release in North America.&lt;ref name="licensing"/&gt; The first volume, ({{ISBN|978-1-4278-0053-4}}), was released September 1, 2008, and the second, ({{ISBN|978-1-4278-0214-9}}), was published January 1, 2009.&lt;ref name="manga COD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyopop.com/manga/book_catalog/browse?alphabet=C&amp;hide_adult=Y&amp;p=2|title=Manga + Comics: Book Catalog|publisher=[[Tokyopop]]|accessdate=26 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828041424/http://www.tokyopop.com/manga/book_catalog/browse?alphabet=C&amp;hide_adult=Y&amp;p=2|archivedate=28 August 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also licensed in France by Soleil Manga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soleilmanga.com/manga-283.htm|title=Castlevania Tome 1|trans-title=Castlevania volume 1|publisher=Soleil Manga|language=French|accessdate=3 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120910084942/http://www.soleilmanga.com/manga-283.htm|archivedate=10 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Castlevania: Curse of Darkness'' was positively received by English-language readers. The first volume ranked 72nd on the list of the top 100 best-selling graphic novels in September 2008 with an estimated 1,564 copies sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/13520.html|title=Top 100 Graphic Novels Actuals—September 2008|date=22 October 2008|publisher=ICv2|accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008, the second volume placed 171st on the list of the top 300 best-selling graphic novels with an estimated 720 copies sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/14112.html|title=Top 300 Graphic Novels Actuals—December 2008|date=22 January 2009|publisher=ICv2|accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it received mixed reviews from English-language critics—two of whom were fans of the Castlevania franchise. Criticism focused on Sasakura's artwork which tended to focus on close-ups and neglect the backgrounds, and the lack of fleshed-out characters.&lt;ref name="PCS review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popcultureshock.com/manga/index.php/reviews/manga-reviews/castlevania-curse-of-darkness-vol-1/|title=Castlevania: Curse of Darkness, Vol. 1|author=Haley, Ken|date=19 September 2008|publisher=PopCultureShock|accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mania Entertainment's Nadia Oxford disliked having a child as one of the main characters, calling it "unnecessary pandering to a younger audience" and concluding that "It's disappointing to see Castlevania thrown to a kid like so many other great properties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/castlevania-curse-darkness-vol-01_article_86932.html|title=Castlevania: Curse of Darkness Vol. #01|date=23 October 2008|author=Oxford, Nadia|publisher=Mania Entertainment|accessdate=2 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216192122/http://www.mania.com/castlevania-curse-darkness-vol-01_article_86932.html|archivedate=16 February 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, another reviewer described it as "a fairly well done vampire comic book" with a "pitch perfect mood" and pleasant artwork,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookbin.com/castlevaniacurseofdarkness001.html|title=Castlevania: Curse of Darkness|author=Douresseaux, Leroy|date=24 September 2008|publisher=Coolstreak Cartoons|accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[About.com]]'s Deb Aoki ranked it fifteenth on her list of the twenty-two best vampire manga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manga.about.com/od/recommendedreading/tp/VampireManga.01.htm|title=Best Vampire Manga—Best of the Bloodsuckers—22 Best Vampire Manga|author=Aoki, Deb|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Professional wrestling]] and [[mixed martial arts]] (Also known as MMA) both combine [[grappling]] and [[strike (attack)|strikes]]. In MMA fights are competed over, in contrast to professional wrestling where the outcomes and moves performed are often [[scripted]] or predetermined. Despite the differences in competition, there have been people that have competed in both professional wrestling and MMA. 
{{TOC limit|2}}

==Comparison==
Professional wrestling could be considered a [[performance art]] which combines [[Athletics (physical culture)|athletics]] with [[Performing arts|theatrical performance]].&lt;ref name="Barthes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barthes|first=Roland|title=The World Of Wrestling |work=Mythologies |year=1957 |url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~ikalmar/illustex/Barthes-wrestling.htm |accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matches are contested on a pre-determined basis, where the fight on display is merely for entertainment purposes. Viewers are integral to a professional wrestling match, as the audience is who the action is for. Professional wrestling mixes many styles of [[amateur wrestling]], striking and showmanship to display a fight, whilst the two performers work together to achieve a "worked" fight. Professional wrestling was first popularized in the 19th century [[Europe]] as a carnival attraction.

Mixed Martial Arts, is a hybrid of many types of physical full-contact sports; including [[wrestling]], [[boxing]] and [[Martial Arts]], such as [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]]. The early 1990s saw the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] popularize the term "Mixed Martial Arts", for such a bout. Competitors in MMA are generally skilled in many different styles, however, it is possible to be only proficient in one type of combat. As some professional wrestling moves are simply worked versions of legitimate holds, there can be a crossover between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://uproxx.com/prowrestling/mma-dragon-sleeper-finish-video/ | title=An MMA Fighter Won A Fight With A Shoot Dragon Sleeper | work=Uproxx.com | date=November 12, 2017 | accessdate=January 3, 2018 | author=Hanstock, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly the most successful pro wrestler and MMA star is [[Brock Lesnar]], who has won the world championships in both the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael McAvennie|title=WWE The Yearbook: 2003 Edition|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2003|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nodq.com/ufc/222389802.shtml|title=Brock Lesnar vs. Randy Couture|date=September 2, 2008|last=Spade|first=Bobby|accessdate=September 2, 2008|publisher=NoDQ.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906152912/http://nodq.com/ufc/222389802.shtml|archivedate=September 6, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/12/19/16793746/ufc-brock-lesnar-return-wwe-jim-ross-pro-wrestling-mma-news | title=Jim Ross: Fans are ‘jonesing’ for Lesnar’s UFC return because MMA is lacking superstars right now | publisher=Bloody Elbow Magazine | date=December 19, 2017 | accessdate=January 3, 2018 | author=Ordoñez, Milan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other wrestlers to have won a championship in both MMA and Pro Wrestling include [[Bobby Lashley]] ([[Shark Fights#Current champions|Shark Fights Heavyweight Championship]]&lt;ref name="Shark-Win"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/2011/11/12/bobby-lashley-wins-mma-title-in-lubbock/|title=Bobby Lashley wins MMA title in Lubbock|publisher=Gerweck.net|first=Steve|last=Gerweck|accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Impact Global Championship]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2016/0811/615430/tna-impact-wrestling-results/|title=TNA Impact Wrestling Results (8/11): Damien Sandow TNA Debut, Titles Vs. Title, Lashley Vs. Storm}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[Dan Severn]] who won the UFC Superfight Championship, and the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]].

===Rivalry===
Since MMA's rise to prominence in the 1990s, some pro wrestlers or MMA fighters have been cynical against the other's profession. This can be an attack on the sport as a whole, or acting as a fan dismissing certain actions within that sport.&lt;ref name="BloodyElbow"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/12/18/16793536/ufc-daniel-cormier-disses-pro-wrestling-spots-gets-into-twitter-beef-with-cody-rhodes-mma-news | title=Daniel Cormier disses pro wrestling spots, gets into Twitter beef with Cody Rhodes | publisher=Bloody Elbow Magazine | date=Dec 18, 2017 | accessdate=January 3, 2018 | author=Burke, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cringe comedy''' is a specific genre of [[comedy]] that derives humor from social awkwardness. Often a cringe comedy will have an air of a [[mockumentary]] and revolve around a serious setting, such as a workplace, to lend the comedy a sense of reality.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/05/13/discomfort-zone-10-great-cringe-comedies/|title=Discomfort Zone: 10 Great Cringe Comedies|website=Time|first=Gary|last=Susman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protagonists are typically [[Egotism|egotists]] who overstep the boundaries of [[political correctness]] and break [[social norms]]. Then the comedy will attack the protagonist by not letting them become aware of their self-centered view, or by making them oblivious to the ego-deflation that the comedy deals them. Sometimes, however, an unlikable protagonist may not suffer any consequences, which violates people's moral expectations, and also makes the audience cringe.&lt;ref name=curmudgeon&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFarlane|first=Brian|title=A curmudgeon's canon: random thoughts on 'Summer Heights High', 'The Office' and other nasty pleasures|journal=Metro Magazine|year=2009|issue=160|pages=134–138|url=http://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/swin:30541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Humour theorist [[Noël Carroll]] explains humour in relation to [[Theories of humour#Incongruity theory|incongruity theory]] and annoyance:  &lt;blockquote&gt;"Imagine the cutlery laid out for a formal dinner. Suppose that the salad fork is in the wrong place. If you are the sort of person who is disturbed by such deviations from the norm, you will not be capable of finding this amusing. On the other hand, if you are more easy-going about such matters and also aware of the incongruity, it may elicit a chuckle. That is, you may find the error amusing or not. But if you find it genuinely amusing you cannot find it annoying."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Humour: A very short introduction|last = Carroll|first = Noël|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-19-955222-1|location = |pages = 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Dark Reign 2''''' is a 3D [[real-time strategy]] [[Microsoft Windows]] game released on June 30, 2000 by [[Activision]] and [[Pandemic Studios]].  Being a prequel to ''[[Dark Reign: The Future of War]]'', ''Dark Reign 2'''s storyline focuses on what has come before the conflict in the first ''Dark Reign''.  The game features three modes: campaign, online multiplayer and an instant action mode.

==Plot==
The two opposing factions introduced in ''Dark Reign 2'' are the '''Sprawlers''' (which later evolve to be the ''Freedom Guard'' faction of ''Dark Reign'') and the '''Jovian Detention Authority''' a.k.a. JDA (which evolve to be the ''Imperium'' faction).  The two sides are caught up in a conflict spanning Earth's 26th (and final) century. In the Intro, a Sprawler Leader who interacts with the player in the Sprawler campaign quotes:

The struggle between the Sprawlers and JDA is, at its heart, the struggle between authority and freedom, government and proletariat.  As the earth reeled into ecological collapse, the JDA established large dome cities to protect the citizenry from the harsh conditions outside.  However, they left behind all those who would not succumb to their dictatorial will: the Sprawlers.  The disenfranchised Sprawlers are thus left in the outside world, bathed in the harsh conditions of a dying planet and fueled by the explosive rage of rebels fighting for a free life under the thumb of a cold overlord.  Thus, the Sprawlers desperately fight to break into the dome cities, while the JDA desperately sally out into the decaying 'Sprawl' to keep them out and in a state of submission.

The player can choose to play either the Sprawlers or the JDA campaigns, both with similarities and differences to the overall story. If the player chooses the Sprawlers, he/she is referred to as "Sirdar", a new member of the council eager to prove him/herself. If the player chooses the JDA, he/she is a member of strike force, guided by the JDA central AI, "CYGNET". Both sides are concerned with the massive increase in seismic activity around the world which is consuming it and each other. As the story progresses, both sides gain access to new units and structures which the player will need to use in order to proceed further and develop more powerful strategies.

===Sprawler plot===
The Sprawlers are running low on numbers and have been on the defensive for a long time. The council heavily squabbles on going offensive or staying defensive, noting they can't stay on the defensive forever. A new [[Sirdar]] (the player) begins by aiding them in a more important offensive than the skirmishes of recent, hacking a communication centre feeding a city zone JDA propaganda so that the Sprawlers can spread their own message. They are the first to notice that seismic activity on Earth is increasing on a global scale and taking advantage by making a strike on a crippled base, bringing their first victory.

During the quake, they discover that the door seal of Togra's shrine, the research lab of the great Togra himself, has opened despite only being openable by Togra. According to legends, the breaking of the seal signals the beginning of a chain of events. The Sirdar must then send forces through icey mountains to rescue the Voodun high priest, Booda Shun, from JDA captivity and take him to the shrine so he can examine the site.

After interpreting the site, Booda Shun brings disturbing news. The breaking of the seal indicates that Earth's time is limited and "the planet is rolling toward a catastrophic collapse", which will bring the end of everything. During the previous mission, JDA forces were snooping around the site, which indicates they may have find something or are making plans. Sirdar is ordered to hack into the nearby Cygnet relay station to see what the JDA have in mind. After infiltrating the station despite heavy resistance before and after, the station is destroyed and the council reviews the information.

The plans reveal the JDA are relocating massive numbers of citizens to the central dome. Activity in the area is increasing at phenomenal rates.  The purpose is clear.  The JDA are preparing to evacuate Earth, leaving the Sprawlers behind.  The council is outraged.  As one member says, "First they ruin the planet and then they leave us to die with it." He declares death to the JDA and asks who is with him. With this, the whole council unites and puts their squabbling behind. But they find that the dome could have been assaulted easily years ago. Because of how much harder the direct way is to penetrate at the current time, they find the only possible way through is along the coast, which passes through two sub-factions, known as the Breks and the Judas.

The Sirdar is charged with leading the way. After securing the river and earning the Breks trust, thanks to new aerial and water technologies, they find the JDA have a secret weapons facility not far ahead from intel by their new allies. A prototype mobile bomb sits outside. Sirdar, if careful, is able to make off with three copies of the prototype, though only one is required. Then the sprawlers aid the Judas in taking out JDA forces that are thinning their numbers, gaining their trust.

With their forces built, the final missions involve storming the dome and preventing the JDA from being able to evacuate. If successful, the Sprawlers will become the dominant force and the JDA will be either severely crippled or destroyed.

===JDA plot===
Activity in the city is going wild with sprawlers making regular skirmishes and setting up anti-air batteries that harass air traffic. The situation in Sector 13 is the worst. After being shot down by one of the batteries, Strike Force's first objective is to rescue a base from destruction, push back Sprawler forces and clearing all the anti-air batteries in the area so that an air strike can be performed on the Sprawler base. Along the way, the first earthquake occurs, almost destroying the base Strike Force rescues.

In the next mission, the JDA also discover Togra's shrine has been damaged in the quake. They wish to investigate. Strike Force captures a Voodun priest as a prisoner and force him to take them to the shrine. But along the way, powerful Togran pylons prevent movement up the hill without being destroyed. To deal with this, Strike Force deploys aerial infantry to destroy two Togran power generators in order to disable the pylons and proceed. At the site, they discover a strange mobile artifact, which resembles an ancient slab on a hovering platform. Cygnet indicates the higher up ranks wish to study the artifact and orders Strike Force to evacuate the artficat to a transporter.

Shortly after, radio chatter shows the evacuation plans are in effect and there is a state of panic. In one jungle area, a large JDA force is evacuating without authorization and are primarily concerned with themselves. Their plans make them abandon their post at a large powered gate, which is meant to prevent hordes of Sprawlers from entering the zone. Strike Force is sent in to deal with the cowards before they can escape, which is followed by pushing back the Sprawlers and building power generators on the gate, reactivating it. With the JDA's grip on the sector regained, Strike Force is relocated.

It is at that time found that there are three Togran artifacts. Strike Force is tasked with retrieving the second artifact hidden in a temple but along the way, encounter heavy resistance with suicidal cultists of unknown origin, as well as Baron Samedi's, traditionally a Sprawler power from the Shrine. Despite this, Strike force is able to locate and evacuate the artifact. Afterward, the challenge is on to find the third. This is achieved by a large offensive in Arctic mountains to capture Booda Shun, the Voodun High Priest, who reveals the location of the third artifact. Hidden in a city sector, Strike Force must find it before the Sprawlers do. The problem is not only pushing back the Sprawlers, but taking punishment from the frequent earthquakes in the zone.

Toward the end, the evacuation plan is in the final stages. However, the JDA does not wish for the artifacts to be taken into the hands of the Sprawlers, along with the Sprawlers leaving with them. They try to destroy all three artifacts, but can't for three reasons. First, a large destructive force is required to destroy them. Second, they have to be destroyed at the same time. Finally, destroying the artifacts will bring about the end of the world. During the final stage, as the last JDA citizens are being evacuated, Cygnet requests that Strike Force sacrifice themselves by remaining behind and destroying the artifacts, achieving this by gathering them around a large number of atomic energy plants before detonating them. It ends with the defeat of the Sprawlers, the salvation of the JDA, the destruction of Earth and the loss of Strike Force. This brings the JDA Campaign to a rather sad and abrupt end.

==Multiplayer==
The game contains multiplayer functionality, allowing up to 32 players at once, featuring four 'rulesets"; Gluttony, Protect HQ, Blood Bath, and Deathmatch.  Blood Bath is a mode in which the first team to kill a certain number of units wins.  Protect HQ (by far the most used) is a ruleset in which a player who loses their HQ for a certain period of time (about three minutes) loses.  Gluttony is a condition where the first player to collect a certain amount of resources wins.  Deathmatch is a ruleset in which a player who loses all of their units is defeated.

==Mods==
Players are allowed to create custom mods for the game by making simple configuration files and using the packaging software which can be found on the original game CD.

The game has a built-in map editor and there are several tutorials available on the internet to create your own terrains.

==Source code leak==
In 2011, an unauthorized [[Internet leak|leak]] of the complete [[source code]] tree to the game was made to the Internet and posted to a [[Google Code]] [[Repository (version control)|repository]] by a claimed former [[Pandemic Studios]] developer under a [[LGPL]] license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://games.slashdot.org/story/12/08/07/1225237/dark-reign-2-goes-open-source |title=Dark Reign 2 Goes Open Source |author=timothy |date=2012-08-07 |accessdate=2013-08-13 |work=[[slashdot]].org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Hacker News]] user received confirmation from the repository owner that this was in fact a leak and not an officially sanctioned code release.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4350254&lt;/ref&gt; The leak also included headers and code from 3rd-party sources with licenses that explicitly forbid public disclosure and redistribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code.google.com/p/darkreign2/ |title=darkreign2 |work=[[Google Code]] |date=2011-09-01 |accessdate=2013-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Deaf Theatre Network Europe''' is an open platform of professional deaf theatres. This network was established in 2001 in Vienna during the European Deaf Theatre Conference. The mission of the platform is to bring deaf artists and deaf theatre to a bigger audience.

The following projects are part of the mission statement:

*1. Permanent videodocumentary of the work by deaf professionals. This work is done by the "Teatr 3§ from [[Szczecin]](Poland) under the artistic direction of Olgier Koczorowski.
*2. Deaf Theatre for children presented in cooperation with the deaf theatre of the Janaček Academy for Performing Arts in [[Brno]] VDN-DIFA-JAMU(Czech Republic), "Teatr 3" Szczecin, Quest:arts for everyone(USA) and ARBOS- Company for Music and Theatre(Austria).
*3. Professional education and courseware for training of deaf actors coordinated by ARBOS - Company for Music and Thestre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ4TddwMC2Q&amp;feature=gv&amp;hl=de] "Speaking Hands" - Documentary Film of a training course for deaf actor done by the deaf actors Horst Dittrich and Werner Mössler and the director [[Herbert Gantschacher]]. PZG-ARBOS Szczecin-Salzburg 2001-2008&lt;/ref&gt;
*4. The history of Deaf Theatre in Europe.
*5. Cooperation of "Teatr 3", ARBOS and Ramesh Meyyappan(Singapore/Scotland) during the elaboration of theatre projects.
*6. Organisation of the "European Deaf Theatre Conference" and informal meetings of the theatre during the year coordinated by ARBOS.
*7. Performances during the "European &amp; International Deaf Theatre Festival" in [[Vienna]] plus network conference.
Deaf Theatre is a part of the world of the arts and is done by deaf artists. But a cooperation of deaf and hearing artists on an equal level is possible. Deaf Theatre tells stories of deaf people, their lives and their culture. The theatre may include [[sign language]], [[drama]], [[mime]], [[visual theatre]], [[dance]], music, comedy and all other forms of [[performing arts]].

"Deaf Theatre" is performed for deaf and hearing audience.

'''Dermot Power''', originally from [[County Waterford]], Ireland, is a  movie [[concept artist]] who started his career as a  [[comic book artist]] working for British anthology comic ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]''.

==Biography==

He got his break in comic books when he was commissioned to do the cover of a Judge Dredd video game back in 1990. His painterly covers quickly established him as a major talent. He then worked for ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'' on flagship titles like ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' and ''[[Sláine (comics)|Sláine]]'' up until 1997, when he successfully pursued a career in the film industry as a storyboard and concept artist.

He has served as a conceptual artist on movies such as ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Batman Begins]]'', the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' series]], and ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''.

He has also  painted the artwork for several ''[[Batman]]'' [[trading cards]], and a number of illustrations for the ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]''  and Warcraft card games.

[[File:CRT mask types en-de.svg|thumb|290x290px|Some types of pixel layout showing how pixel pitch is measured.]]

'''Dot pitch''' (sometimes called '''line pitch''', '''stripe pitch''', or '''phosphor pitch''') is a specification for a [[computer display]], [[computer printer]], [[image scanner]], or other [[pixel]]-based device that describes the distance, for example, between dots ([[pixel#Subpixels|sub-pixels]]) on a display screen. In the case of an [[RGB_color_model|RGB]] color display, the derived unit of '''pixel pitch''' is a measure of the size of a [[triad (monitors)|triad]] plus the distance between triads.	

Dot pitch may be measured in linear units (with smaller numbers meaning higher resolution), usually [[millimeters]] (mm), or as a rate, for example [[dots per inch]] (with a larger number meaning higher resolution). Closer spacing produces a sharper image (as there are more dots in a given area). However, other factors may affect image quality, including:	
* Undocumented or inadequately documented measurement method, complicated by ignorance of the existence of different methods
* Confusion of pixels and subpixels
* Element spacing varying across screen area (e.g. widening in corners compared to center)
* Differing [[pixel geometry|pixel geometries]]
* Differing image and pixel aspect ratios
* Miscellanea such as [[Kell factor]] or [[interlaced video]]

The exact difference between horizontal and diagonal dot pitch varies with the design of the monitor (see [[pixel geometry]] and [[Widescreen#Computer displays|widescreen]]), but a typical entry-level 0.28&amp;nbsp;mm (diagonal) monitor has a horizontal pitch of 0.24 or 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm, a good quality 0.26&amp;nbsp;mm (diagonal) unit has a horizontal pitch of 0.22&amp;nbsp;mm.

The above dot pitch measurement does not apply to [[aperture grille]] displays. Such monitors use continuous vertical phosphor bands on the screen, so the vertical distance between scan lines is limited only by video input signal's vertical resolution and the thickness of electron beam, so there is no vertical 'dot pitch' on such devices. Aperture grille only has horizontal 'dot pitch', or otherwise known as 'stripe pitch'.

In [[game theory]], a two-player deterministic [[perfect information]] [[Sequential game|turn-based game]] is a '''first-player-win''' if with [[Solved game#Perfect play|perfect play]] the first player to move can always force a win. Similarly, a game is '''second-player-win''' if with perfect play the second player to move can always force a win. With perfect play, if neither side can force a win, the game is a '''draw'''.

Some games with relatively small [[game tree]]s have been proven to be first or second-player wins. For example, the game of [[nim]] with the classic 3–4–5 starting position is a first-player-win game. However, Nim with the 1-3-5-7 starting position is a second-player-win. The classic game of [[Connect Four]] has been mathematically proven to be first-player-win.

With perfect play, [[English draughts|checkers]] has been determined to be a draw; neither player can force a win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1144079 |title=Checkers Is Solved |date= |accessdate=2008-11-24 |doi=10.1126/science.1144079 |volume=317 |journal=Science |pages=1518–1522}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of a game which leads to a draw with perfect play is [[tic-tac-toe]], and this includes play from any opening move.

Significant theory has been completed in the effort to [[Solving chess|solve chess]]. It has been speculated that there may be [[First-move advantage in chess|first-move advantage]] which can be detected when the game is played imperfectly (such as with all humans and all current [[chess engine]]s). However, with perfect play, it remains unsolved as to whether the game is a first-player win (White), a second player win (Black), or a forced draw.&lt;ref&gt;J.W.H.M. Uiterwijk, H.J. van den Herik.

'''Free-to-air''' ('''FTA''') are [[television]] (TV) and [[radio]] services broadcast in clear ([[Encryption|unencrypted]]) form, allowing any person with the [[FTA Receiver|appropriate receiving equipment]] to receive the signal and view or listen to the content without requiring a [[Pay television|subscription]], other ongoing cost or one-off fee (e.g. [[Pay-per-view]]). In the traditional sense, this is carried on [[Radio|terrestrial radio]] signals and received with an antenna.

FTA also refers to channels and broadcasters providing content for which no subscription is expected, even though they may be delivered to the viewer/listener by another carrier for which a subscription is required, e.g. [[Cable television|cable]], [[satellite television|satellite]] or the [[Internet]]. These carriers may be mandated (or opt) in some geographies to deliver FTA channels even if a premium subscription is not present (providing the necessary equipment is still available), especially where FTA channels are expected to be used for emergency broadcasts, similar to the [[1-1-2|112]] emergency service provided by mobile phone operators and manufacturers.

[[Free-to-view]] (FTV) is, generally, available without [[subscription]] but is digitally encoded and may be restricted geographically.

Free-to-air is often used for [[international broadcasting]], making it something of a video equivalent to [[shortwave radio]].
Most FTA retailers list free to air channel guides and content available in North America for free to air use.

== Funding ==
Although commonly described as free, the cost of free-to-air services is met through various means:
* Tax payer funding
* with an enforced levy of a [[television licence|licence fee]] for transmission and production costs (e.g., the [[BBC]])
* with a voluntary donation for local transmission and production costs (e.g., [[PBS]])
* with commercial advertising for transmission and production costs and surplus revenues returned to the government (e.g., [[CBC Television]]/[[Télévision de Radio-Canada]] in [[Canada]], [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] in Australia and [[TVNZ]] in New Zealand)
* Commercial sponsorship
* Consumer products and services where part of the cost goes toward television [[advertising]] and [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] (in the case of Japanese television broadcasters like [[TV Asahi]] and [[TV Tokyo]] which rely heavily on sponsorship, similar to Philippine broadcasters like [[ABS-CBN]], [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]] and [[GMA Network|GMA]])

== Americas ==

=== Brazil ===
In [[Brazil]] the main FTA satellite is the [[Star One C2]], it holds approximately 30 C-band analog channels, including all major networks like [[Rede Globo]], [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão|SBT]], [[Rede Record|Record]], [[RedeTV!]], [[Rede Bandeirantes|Band]] and others, and 5 digital [[HDTV]] channels.+itv 1

=== North America ===
There are a number of competing systems in use. Early adopters used C-band [[satellite dish|dishes]] several feet in diameter to receive analog microwave broadcasts, and later digital microwave broadcasts using the 3.7-4.2&amp;nbsp;GHz band. Today, although large C-band dishes can still receive some content, the 11.7-12.2&amp;nbsp;GHz {{Ku band}} is also used.  Ku-band signals can be received using smaller dishes, often as small as under a meter in diameter, allowing FTA satellite to be picked up from smaller spaces such as apartment balconies (note, however, that these dishes are not quite as small as those commonly used for commercial services such as Dish Network, DirecTV, Bell ExpressVu, Shaw Direct, etc.  Dishes intended for those services may not deliver an adequate signal on Ku-band). The European-developed [[DVB-S]] and [[DVB-S2]] standards are the most commonly used broadcast methods, with analog transmissions almost completely discontinued as of mid-2014.

The most common North American sources for free-to-air DVB [[satellite television]] are:
* [[NHK World]] HD on [[Intelsat 9]] (58°W)
* [[Retro Television Network]], [[TuffTV]] on [[AMC 9]] (83°W)
* [[Louisiana Public Broadcasting|LPB]] Louisiana PBS channels LPBHD, LPB2, and LPB3 (Create) on [[SES 2]] (89°W)
* [[NASA TV]] Multi-channel (NASA TV Public-Education, NASA Media, NASA TV UHD) on [[Horizons-1]] (aka Galaxy 13) (127°W)
* [[Eternal Word Television Network]] on [[Galaxy 17]] (91°W)
* [[My Family TV]], [[CGTN (TV channel)|CGTN]] on [[Galaxy 3C]] (95°W).
* [[AMGTV]] and [[BYUtv|BYU Television]] (BYUtv) on [[Galaxy 19]] (97°W)
* English and foreign language broadcasters [[RT (TV network)]], [[Ebru TV]], [[Islamic Republic of Iran News Network|IRINN]], [[Al Jazeera English]] and more up-linked by [[GlobeCast World TV]] on [[Galaxy 19]] (97°W)
* Christian broadcasters such as [[The Word Network]], [[Emmanuel TV]], [[Daystar Television Network]], [[JCTV]], [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]], [[The Church Channel]], [[3ABN]], [[The Hope Channel]], [[Amazing Facts]] Television, [[God's Learning Channel]] are broadcast from the [[Galaxy 19]] (97°W) satellite for [[Glorystar]] and [[Spiritcast]] Satellite Systems TV.
* Peace TV English and Peace TV Urdu language which are global Islamic channels, available on Galaxy 19 (97°W)
* [[DoD News]] on [[AMC 1]] (103°W)
* [[Jewish Life Television]] on [[Galaxy 18]] (123°W)
* [[Montana PBS|Montana Public Broadcasting Service]] and other [[PBS Satellite Service]]s on AMC 21 (125°W)
* [[Classic Arts Showcase]] on [[Galaxy 17]] (91°W) and [[Eternal Word Television Network]] HD on [[Galaxy 15]] (133°W)
* Football, Basketball, Baseball, Soccer, and Hockey [[wildfeed]]s on various satellites
* Infowars and Alex Jones Show broadcasts from Austin, TX and creates free to air 24/7 content on Galaxy 16 99°W

Most of these signals are carried by [[United States|US]] satellites. There is little or no free Canadian DVB-S content available to users of medium-size dishes as much of the available Ku-band satellite bandwidth is occupied by [[pay-TV]] operators [[Shaw Direct]] and [[Bell TV]], although larger C-band dishes can pick up some content. FTA signals may be scattered across multiple satellites, requiring a motor or multiple [[Low-noise block downconverter|LNB]]s to receive everything.  This differs from Europe, where FTA signals are commonly concentrated on a few specific satellites.

Another difference between North American FTA and FTA in most of the rest of the world is that in North America, very few of the available signals are actually intended for home viewers or other end-users.  Instead, they are generally intended for reception by local television stations, cable system headends, or other commercial users.  While it is generally thought to be legal for home viewers to view such transmissions as long as they are not encrypted, this means that there are several unique challenges to viewing FTA signals that are not present in other areas of the world.  Among these are:

* No schedule information is provided with most of the signals, therefore satellite receivers cannot show a proper [[electronic program guide]] ([[EPG]]).
* Because many of these broadcasts are essentially point-to-point transmissions, the originators often do not follow any international standards when setting various identification fields in the data stream.  This causes issues with receivers and software designed for use in other parts of the world, as they may assume that if a channel contains the same ID information as another channel, those are duplicate channels.  This may be a valid assumption in other parts of the world, but is almost never valid for North American FTA signals.  When such an assumption is made, during a "blind scan" the receiver or software will often fail to correctly insert one or more channels into its database, or it may overwrite previously scanned valid channels (including other channels on the same satellite) with invalid information picked up from another, more recently scanned channel.  If the end user does not understand what is happening, they may assume that the receiver cannot receive certain channels or that it is defective, yet if the correct data for those channels can be manually entered, those channels may become receivable.  This problem can be mitigated if receivers can be set to ignore channels that appear to be duplicates during a "blind scan", except when such channels are on exactly the same satellite and same transponder frequency (as might occur if the user rescans a previously-scanned satellite).
* Channels tend to come and go, or change transmission formats, often without any prior notice other than to their intended recipients.  This means that a working channel could suddenly disappear without warning, and may need to be rescanned to become receivable again, or it may be gone permanently.
* Channels that are currently FTA can become scrambled (encrypted) with no advance warning.  A few channels tend to go back and forth between being "in the clear" (unscrambled) to scrambled at various times, but in most cases, once a channel is scrambled it stays scrambled.
* Historically, it has appeared that broadcasters are more likely to scramble their signals when they become aware that home viewers and other "unauthorized" viewers are watching their signals. Therefore, those who know what signals are available may sometimes be reluctant to share that information in open forums.  While sites exist that attempt to list currently viewable FTA signals, most of them are incomplete or do not contain current information.  Such sites typically rely on reports of changes by viewers, and if viewers are reluctant to report new FTA signals for fear they might disappear, it becomes more of a challenge for such sites to maintain up-to-date listings.
* What some would consider the most desirable signals, e.g. feeds from broadcast networks, are primarily only available on C-band, which requires a large dish (usually at least 6 feet/1.8 meters in diameter or more, although a few hobbyists have found it possible to receive some C-band signals using smaller dishes and high quality LNB's).  Also some of those signals utilize high-bitrate formats that cannot be received by many older receivers, even if those receivers are capable of receiving digital signals, and such signals may require a larger than usual dish for adequate reception.  In many areas, local zoning laws and/or homeowner associations forbid the placement of a large dish, therefore such dishes have fallen out of favor since commercial satellite services became widely available.  Therefore, very few people have the capability to receive the C-band broadcasts.  Another issue is that properly aiming a C-band dish is not something that a typical end-user would know how to do, since it tends to be a somewhat complex procedure (especially when a moveable dish is used with the intention of tracking the visible satellite arc in order to receive multiple satellites), and many of the installers that knew how to set up and correctly aim a C-band dish have exited the business.
* While equipment and software is becoming available that allows home users to set up a backend system that can deliver received over-the-air [[ATSC]] signals to several frontend systems (for example, a [[HDHomeRun]], [[VBox Home TV Gateway]] or similar TV tuner, used with [[MythTV]] or [[TVHeadEnd]]), a similar system for receiving FTA signals is considerably more difficult to set up.  While PCI/PCIe tuner cards and USB tuners for DVB-S and DVB-S2 are available, there are often issues with drivers, or the cards may simply not be compatible with the backend software in use.  Therefore, setting up such a system for FTA satellite reception tends to require considerably more technical knowledge, and a willingness to work through issues, than setting up such a system for receiving terrestrial signals.
* Some syndicated programming is being sent as data, similar to the way a video file might be sent over the Internet.  This means that the programming is not sent in a format that can be viewed in real time, as it is being received.  Instead, the data must be captured to a storage device and decoded for later use.  Traditional satellite receivers and even many PC tuner cards are not capable of receiving these signals, and even if you have a card capable of receiving such signals, you also need special software to find such data streams and when one is found, to extract the data stream and save it.

The largest groups of end-users for Ku-band free-to-air signals were initially the ethnic-language communities, as often free ethnic-language programming would be sponsored by Multilingual American Communities and their broadcasters. Depending on language and origin of the individual signals, North American ethnic-language TV is a mix of pay-TV, free-to-air and DBS operations. Today, many American broadcasters send a multitude of programming channels in many languages, spanning many new channels, so they can get National support, which ultimately leads to carriage by cable systems, to additionally support the high costs of broadcasting signals in this way.

Nevertheless, free-to-air satellite TV is a viable addition to home video systems, not only for the reception of specialized content but also for use in locations where terrestrial [[ATSC]] over-the-air reception is incomplete and additional channels are desired.

==Asia/Oceania==
===Australia===
{{See also|Television in Australia|Freeview (Australia)}}
[[Australia]] has five major free-to-air networks: [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC), [[Seven Network]], [[Nine Network]], [[Network Ten]], and [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS). Traditionally each network had only a single channel in a geographic area, though with the advent of digital television each network now has [[SD video|SD]] multichannels [[7TWO]], [[7mate]], [[7flix]], [[9Go!]], [[9Gem]], [[9Life]], [[10 Boss]], [[10 Peach]], [[SBS Viceland]] and [[SBS Food]] respectively, and one [[High-definition television|HD]] networks simulcasting [[ABC HD (Australian TV channel)|ABC HD]], [[7HD]], [[9HD]], [[10 HD]] and [[SBS HD]] respectively. With the exception of SBS, each commercial broadcaster also has one SD [[datacasting]] channel: [[Your Money (TV channel)|Your Money]], [[TVSN]] and [[Spree TV]] respectively; SBS instead broadcasts [[National Indigenous Television|NITV]] free-to-air. The ABC is exempt from the policy limiting the number of multichannels, and currently runs three SD channels [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC]], [[ABC Comedy]], [[ABC ME]], [[ABC News (TV channel)|ABC News]], and a primary channel which is simulcast on both analogue and digital. ABC and SBS channels are available across Australia; outside the major capital cities, regional affiliates provide channels that are essentially identical to the metropolitan commercial channels. In addition, [[Community television in Australia|community television]] provides one channel in some major cities.

Australia's two main [[Public Broadcasting|government-owned TV channels]], the ABC and SBS, along with the digital-only multichannels ABC Comedy, ABC ME and SBS Viceland, are both available free-to-air on the [[Optus D1]] satellite. Viewers in remote parts of Australia could also access [[Seven Central]] and [[Imparja Television]], or [[WIN WA]] and [[GWN7]] in [[Western Australia]], through the DVB-S [[free-to-view]] [[Optus Aurora]] service, which was replaced in December 2013 with the DVB-S2 free-to-view Optus [[Viewer Access Satellite Television|VAST]] service.

Other satellite-only channels such as [[Expo Channel|Expo]], [[Press TV]] and [[Al Jazeera English]] are available free-to-air on various satellites.

===New Zealand===
{{Main article|List of free-to-air television stations in New Zealand}}
New Zealand has a number of FTA broadcasters such as [[Television New Zealand]]'s [[TVNZ 1]] and [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]], as well as [[MediaWorks New Zealand]]'s [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] and [[C4 (TV channel)|FOUR]], [[Sky Network Television]]'s [[Prime Television New Zealand|Prime]] and the government subsidised the [[Māori Television]] and [[Te Reo (TV channel)|Te Reo]] channels.

Four channels, TV One, TV2, TV3, FOUR are also broadcast timeshifted by +1 hour on Freeview and Sky platforms.

A broadcast of parliament and a number of local channels, such as [[Cue TV]] are also available. Local stations such as [[Canterbury Television|CTV]] and Face TV (previously Triangle TV) were free-to-air analogue PAL transmissions prior to CTV migrating to the free-to-air digital DVB-T service and Face TV's terrestrial free-to-air service shutoff from December 2013.

A digital terrestrial version of Freeview was launched in 2008, which, unlike the analogue and free-to-air satellite options, supports [[high-definition television|high-definition]] broadcasts for TV One, 2 and 3.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, the largest and most dominant television channel, [[Television Broadcasts Limited]], was the first free-to-air commercial television channel when it commenced broadcasting on 19 November 1967. It may also well be among the oldest and first station to broadcast over-the-air in East and Southeast Asia.

===South Korea===
In Korea, [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]], [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]] (the 2 main public broadcasters), [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]] (privately owned, but available for free to viewers), and [[Educational Broadcasting System|EBS]] (including both [[TV]] and [[radio]]) are the free-to-air broadcasting stations. They dominate more than 80% of advertisement profits, according to the recent survey from the agency {{ambiguous|date=May 2017}}.
Due to the recent government's {{which|date=May 2017}} decision, [[digital television]] service for all free-to-air networks would be scheduled before the year 2012, followed by the end of analog television broadcasting.

===India and South Asia===
{{See also|Television in India}}
Around 600 FTA television channels and 180 Radio Channel are broadcast from ku-band and c-band transponders on the [[INSAT-4B]] and [[GSAT-15]] satellite covering India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and parts of Afghanistan, China, and Myanmar. In India, the channels are marketed as [[DD Direct Plus]]/ [[DD Free Dish]] by [[Doordarshan]], India's national broadcaster and other Indian private broadcaster [[ABS Free Dish]] from the ABS2 satellite, one can receive free-to-air regional TV channels using small DTH antenna and freetoair set-top box.

===Middle East and North Africa===
{{empty section|date=May 2017}}

===Israel===
Up until 2012, Israel had several free-to-air channels, the major ones rating-wise: [[Channel 2 (Israel)|Channel 2]], [[Channel 10 (Israel)|Channel 10]], and [[Channel 1 (Israel)|Channel 1]]. The other ones were [[Israeli Educational Television|Channel 23]], [[Channel 33 (Israel)|Channel 33]], and [[Knesset Channel|Channel 99]].

== Europe ==
=== Satellite ===
{{See also|List of free-to-air channels at 28°E}}
European countries have a tradition of most television services being free to air. Germany, in particular, receives in excess of 100 digital satellite TV channels free to air. Approximately half of the television channels on [[SES Astra]]'s [[Astra 19.2°E|19.2° east]] and [[Astra 28.2°E|28.2° east]] satellite positions, and [[Eutelsat]]'s [[Hot Bird]] (13° east) are free-to-air.

A number of European channels which one might expect to be broadcast free-to-air - including many countries' national terrestrial broadcasters - do not do so ''via satellite'' for [[copyright]] reasons. (Rights to purchase programs for free-to-air broadcast, especially via satellite, are often higher in price than for encrypted broadcast.) However, these channels usually provide a scheme to offer free, but encrypted, viewing with [[free-to-view]] broadcasts. Certain programming on Italy's [[RAI]], and the majority of Dutch channels are covered by such schemes (although in the case of RAI some programming is transmitted without encryption where there are no copyright issues). In [[Austria]], the main national networks broadcast free-to-view via satellite; however, all regional and some smaller channels are transmitted free-to-air, and the national public broadcaster, [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]], offers a special free-to-air channel which airs selected programming without (i.e. those without copyright issues) via satellite all over Europe.

As Germany and Austria speak the same language and use the same satellite, Austrian viewers are able to receive about 120 free German-speaking channels from both countries.

In general, all [[satellite radio]] in Europe is free to air, but the more conventional broadcast systems in use mean that [[SiriusXM]] style in-car reception is not possible.

Cable and satellite distribution allow many more channels to carry sports, movies and specialist channels which are not broadcast as FTA. The viewing figures for these channels are generally much lower than the FTA channels.

=== Terrestrial ===
Various European countries broadcast a large number of channels via free-to-air [[terrestrial television|terrestrial]], generally as an analog [[PAL]]/[[SECAM]] transmission, digital [[DVB-T]]/[[DVB-T2|T2]] or a combination of the two.

==== France ====
{{main article|television in France}}
In France, there are twenty six national television channels (MPEG-4 HD video) and 41 local television channels broadcast free-to-air via the TNT DVB-T service.

==== Germany ====
{{main article|television in Germany#terrestrial}}
In Germany there are various free-to-air DVB-T services available, the number of which varies by region. [[Das Erste]], [[ZDF]], [[ZDFneo]], [[ZDFinfo]], [[3sat]], [[Arte]], [[KiKA]] and [[Phoenix (German TV station)|Phoenix]] are available throughout the country, in addition to at least one region-dependent channel which is provided by the regional [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] member. Additionally, ARD's [[EinsFestival]], [[EinsPlus]] and [[tagesschau24]] are variously available in some parts of the country, and various commercial channels are available in metropolitan areas.

==== Ireland ====
{{main article|Saorview}}
In the Republic of Ireland, there are nine television channels and 11 radio channels broadcast free-to-air via the DVB-T Saorview service. Analog PAL versions of some of the channels were also broadcast until October 24, 2012, when all analogue television broadcasting was shut down.

==== Netherlands ====

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3171">'''Gambling advertising''' is the [[advertising|promotion]] of [[gambling]] by [[casino]]s, [[lottery|lotteries]], [[bookmaker]]s or other organisations that provide the opportunity to make bets.  It is usually conducted through a variety of [[mass media|media]] or through [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ship deals, particularly with [[sport|sporting events]] or people.

Although not as highly regulated as [[tobacco advertising]] and [[alcohol advertising]], in many countries there are strict laws about the way in which such services can be marketed.

Gaming operators often sponsor sporting events, sportspeople or television coverage.  For example, [[Bet365]] sponsor [[snooker]] players and the [[Channel 4]] coverage of [[The 2005 Ashes]] was sponsored by [[Betfair]], both being online betting sites. In other instances, they will do stunts to get public attention. For example, many [[professional boxing|professional boxers]] have been sponsored by [[GoldenPalace.com]], and sport temporary Golden Palace tattoos on their bodies. 

To get around advertising restrictions, some [[online poker]] companies advertise free-play sites, like [[PartyGaming|PartyPoker.net]] and [[PokerStars|PokerStars.net]], and sometimes even call these free sites "poker schools".  These sites restrict access to those of legal age, even though it is not required.

In [[Australia]], the principle gaming agency TAB ([[Totalisator Agency Board]]) ran advertisements on TV during the 1990s, under the tagline "The Adrenaline Bet" (a play on the company's name). Since then, the TAB has been restricted from all advertising on television and other media, but is still allowed to print race dividends in the [[newspaper]].

From September 2007 the UK banned the advertising of around 1,000 gambling sites because they do not meet the guidelines dictated by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6938193.stm BBC.co.uk: Gambling websites face advert ban]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Channel 4 Racing]] enjoyed a turnaround in its financial fortunes after UK law was changed to allow bookmakers to advertise directly on TV; it now contains bookmakers' adverts placed within the programme, shortly before each race.

In 2018, the BBC found links to gambling websites on the junior sections of the websites of several football clubs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/football-clubs-sports-betting-gambling-websites-junior-pages-asa-a8527766.html Football clubs criticised for showing links to online gambling sites on junior pages of their websites] - Jack Watson, The Independent, 8 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geni e o Zepelim''' ([[English language|English]]: Geni and the Zeppelin) is a [[Brazil]]ian [[Música popular brasileira|MPB]] song, composed and recorded by [[Chico Buarque]] for his 1978 album [[Ópera do Malandro (álbum)|Ópera do Malandro]], the soundtrack to the [[Ópera do Malandro|eponymous musical play]], in which the song's plot is set; it is also part of its soundtrack. A [[:pt:Ópera do Malandro (filme)|film adaptation]] was released in 1986.

The song has become relevant enough that the refrain "''joga pedra na Geni''" has been referenced in situations where people are victims of moral patrolling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migalhas.com.br/dePeso/16,MI129789,101048-Joga+pedra+na+Geni|title=Joga Pedra na Geni|publisher=Migalhas|author=Oliveira, Mário Oscar Chaves|date=30 March 2011|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==

The [[lyrics]] are hepta-syllabic [[rhyme|rhyming]] [[verse (poetry)|verse]]s with strict [[metre (poetry)|meter]], and are about Geni, a [[transvestism|transvestite]] who was ostracized by the townspeople. After a [[zeppelin]] approaches the town and its pilot threatens to attack it, the ship's pilot demands Geni to sleep with him so he will spare the town, which she does. The populace temporarily treat Geni differently. The day after, she returns home and is immediately persecuted just as she was before.{{Cn|date=February 2017}}

== Inspiration ==
Some sources suggest Geni could have been inspired by the homonymous character from [[Nelson Rodrigues]]'s 1965 play [[Toda Nudez Será Castigada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criticaemcena.blogspot.com/2010/08/toda-nudez-sera-castigada.html|title=Toda Nudez Será Castigada|publisher=Crítica em Cena|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ged.feevale.br/bibvirtual/Monografia/MonografiaFernandaSantos.pdf |title=O Lar e As Ruas: A Dicotomia das Personagens Femininas na Dramaturgia de Nelson Rodrigues |author=Santos, Fernanda Marques |publisher=Centro Universitário Feevale |date=1 June 2007 |accessdate=30 November 2011 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meaning ==
Various sources believe the song to be critical of [[colonialism]], [[imperialism]] and [[capitalism]], and that Geni is a personification of the [[oppression|oppressed]] groups and peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.pucsp.br/pos/lael/lael-inf/teses/FranciscusWiel.pdf |title=Trabalho e Malandragem como Repressão e Transgressão nas Canções da Ópera do Malandro de Chico Buarque |author=Wiel, Franciscus Willem Antonius Maria Van de |publisher=PUC-SP |accessdate=1 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113192247/http://www4.pucsp.br/pos/lael/lael-inf/teses/FranciscusWiel.pdf |archivedate=13 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

João Marcos Mateus Kogawa, of Revista Urutágua wrote about "Geni e o Zepelim":
&lt;blockquote&gt;Geni symbolizes silence, submission and non-voice, in the context of a system which prevents her from talking. Nevertheless, her other ''subject'' talks through the voice of the author, who portrays her as a martyr or [[hero]]ine, who attacks her inquisitors' values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urutagua.uem.br/010/10kogawa.htm|title=Geni no Entremeio de Uma Arena de Vozes|author=Kogawa, João Marcos Mateus|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Revista Urutágua|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Great All American Youth Circus''', also known as '''The Great Y Circus''', is billed as the oldest community circus in the world and is located in [[Redlands, California]], [[United States]]. 

== History ==
Founded in 1929 by YMCA Director Roy Coble, a former [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|Ringling Brothers Barnum &amp; Bailey]] performer, the Great Y Circus is a unique tradition in Redlands, California. Billed as the oldest community circus in the world, it is one of only a handful of programs like it in the United States. The Great Y Circus started small and has grown tremendously throughout the years. The only years it was dark were from 1943-1948 (during the war) and in 1987-1988 (when the YMCA was without the insurance coverage required and continuation of the circus was in doubt).

Each year, approximately 300 performers of all ages (from 20 months and up) learn circus skills in classes that are held at the YMCA from September through April. The circus features performances such as juggling, trapeze, rings, lear, unicycles, acrobats, and teeterboard. Many youth who participate stay in the program for many years, and some alumni have gone on to jobs in professional entertainment industries as stunt performers and circus performers. A few of the performers are even 4th generation performers in this circus.

Small community outreach performances are given throughout the year for a variety of audiences, and the main end-of-season show is held on the first three weekends of May in the Coble Gym at the Redlands YMCA.

Currently, the circus is co-sponsored by the Redlands YMCA and the non-profit Community Circus Arts Corporation. It is managed by a few YMCA staff members and a very large group of volunteers that include trainers, facilitators, and assistants.

==Summary==
Christian Grey, a successful and rich 27-year-old businessman, meets 21-year-old university student Anastasia "Ana" Steele when she interviews him on behalf of her friend/roommate Katherine "Kate" Kavanagh (being sick with the flu at the time) for the university newspaper. The characters develop an attraction for each other and Christian proposes a [[BDSM|sadomasochistic]] relationship with Ana.

Christian hopes that his relationship with Ana will relieve the effects of a traumatic childhood, but his dark sexual proclivities and self-loathing drive Ana away. Ana is initially naive about Christian's sadism and the power dynamics in their relationship but as the novel progresses she comes to understand that his behaviour is cold and controlling.

==Development==
On 1 June 2015 James announced that she was in the process of writing another book in the ''Fifty Shades'' series due to popular demand from her fanbase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Publisher unfazed by Grey theft|url=http://www.cotswoldjournal.co.uk/news/national/13323657.Publisher_unfazed_by_Grey_theft/|publisher=Cotswold Journal|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same day she posted an image on her [[Instagram]] account that confirmed that the novel would be titled ''Grey'', that it would be told from the perspective of Christian Grey, and that she had deliberately chosen its publication date in order to coincide with Grey's birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EL James whips out new 'Grey'|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/thetimes/2015/06/05/EL-James-whips-out-new-Grey|publisher=Times Live|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fowler|first1=Tara|title=E L James Announces New Fifty Shades of Grey Book Told from Christian's Perspective|url=http://www.people.com/article/fifty-shades-of-grey-el-james-new-book-christian-perspective|publisher=People|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-order sales for ''Grey'' have been extremely strong, which led many retailers to order large quantities of the book in order to meet release day demand.&lt;ref name=TG&gt;{{cite web|last1=Addley|first1=Esther|title=Fourth Fifty Shades book whips up unprecedented pre-ordering frenzy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/12/fourth-fifty-shades-book-whips-up-unprecedented-pre-ordering-frenzy|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editor for ''[[The Bookseller]]'' also commented that ''Grey'' could become the "biggest book of the year".&lt;ref name=TG /&gt;

==Reception==

===Press===
Critical reception for ''Grey'' has been generally negative and many critics have criticized it for being too similar to ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BIEDENHARN|first1=ISABELLA|title=Review Roundup: Christian Grey is a predictable psychopath in E.L. James' 'Grey'|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/06/18/grey-reviews-el-james|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Mail]]'s'' reviewer commented that "Ms James has simply shadowed the whole plot of Book One, reproducing the clunky polystyrene dialogue word for word, and inserting italicised thoughts by Christian himself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The reviews of Grey are in and they've knocked Fifty Shades out of it|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3131183/New-Fifty-Shades-book-Grey-reviews.html|accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'' criticized the book and the choice to include Grey's internal monologues, stating that he had a "vacuous mental life" and that "The effect is increasingly comical – [[Mills &amp; Boon]] meets ''[[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]]'' – while the rest of his internal monologue is spent stating the bleeding obvious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Nick|title=Grey by E L James, review: There's plenty of graphic sex, but Fifty Shades sequel fails to excite|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/grey-e-l-james-book-review-lots-of-in-and-out-but-fifty-shades-sequel-fails-to-excite-10330195.html|publisher=Independent|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' wrote a scathing review where they called it "as sexy as a misery memoir and as arousing as the diary of a sex offender" and wrote "It’s hard to work out what Ms Steele sees in him – even if you try to imagine him as [[Jamie Dornan]], it’s Jamie Dornan as the serial killer in ''[[The Fall (TV series)|The Fall]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Bryony|title=Mr Darcy with nipple clamps': Bryony Gordon reviews EL James's Grey|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/11683078/Mr-Darcy-with-nipple-clamps-Bryony-Gordon-reviews-EL-Jamess-Grey.html|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' remarked on the book, stating that while the first book was "a rather fun and fairly mild portrait of a woman’s sexual fantasy", that "Instead of lighthearted and repetitive mild S&amp;M, the "love affair" is now the twisted work of an utter psychopath."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Colgan|first1=Jenny|title=Grey by EL James review – Christian Grey indulges his inner psychopath|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/18/grey-by-el-james-review-fifty-shades-of-grey-follow-up|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' also found little of the original series in the rewrite: "Where Ana had bizarre quirks, a perplexing "inner goddess" who was an Olympic-caliber backflipper, and a general sense of naive wonder that lightened "Fifty Shades" and reminded readers not to take the story too seriously, there is none of that here. "Grey" is dark and unrelenting and far too serious, like Mr. Grey." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacLean|first1=Sarah|title=Grey: Fifty Shades of Grey as Told by Christian is for fans only|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/grey-fifty-shades-of-grey-as-told-by-christian-by-el-james/2015/06/18/b1f6f83a-1465-11e5-9518-f9e0a8959f32_story.html|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Větruše, zrcadlové bludiště.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A house of mirrors in the Czech Republic]]
A '''house of mirrors''' or '''hall of mirrors''' is a traditional attraction at [[funfair]]s (carnivals) and [[amusement park]]s.  The basic concept behind a house of mirrors is to be a [[maze]]-like puzzle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Styer|first=Joel|title=Funhouse at Jenkinson's Beach Boardwalk|url=http://www.dafe.org/articles/funHouses/funhouse.html|publisher=Darkride and Funhouse Enthusiasts|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the maze, participants are also given mirrors as obstacles, and glass panes to parts of the maze they cannot yet get to. Sometimes the mirrors may be distorted because of different curves, [[wiktionary:convex|convex]], or [[wiktionary:concave|concave]] in the glass to give the participants unusual and confusing reflections of themselves, some humorous and others frightening.

== References in fiction ==

=== Literary ===
The first known literary example is in [[Gaston Leroux]]'s novel ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1911), in which [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Erik]] has built one for the Shah of Persia as a trap and later uses a similar trap to protect his lair from his enemies.  Perhaps the first cinematic instance of this was at the climax of the film ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'' (1948). Other notable examples include [[Woody Allen]]'s movie ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' (1993) which directly refers to ''The Lady from Shanghai''; the CBS soap ''[[Guiding Light]]'' which, in 1980, featured a now famous sequence that depicted heroine [[Rita Stapleton|Rita Bauer]] ([[Lenore Kasdorf]]) being pursued through a hall of mirrors by villain Roger Thorpe ([[Michael Zaslow]]); the show ''[[Macgyver]]'', where Jack Dalton is brainwashed and is forced to fire on Macgyver; and ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|the Teen Titans series]]'' episode "Betrayal". [[Francisco Scaramanga]]'s "Fun House" in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' has a House of mirrors. In an episode of the Twilight Zone, "[[In Praise of Pip]]", a bookie tries to tell his dying son how much he loves him while chasing him inside a house of mirrors; the 1984 movie [[Conan the Destroyer]] with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] contains a house of mirrors fight, and the 1983 [[Walt Disney]] movie ''[[Something Wicked This Way Comes (film)|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]'' (an adaptation of [[Ray Bradbury]]'s [[Something Wicked This Way Comes (novel)|novel of the same title]]) culminates in a house of mirrors confrontation. In the fourth season of the show [[Leverage (TV series)|Leverage]], in the episode "The Carnival Job", Elliot has a showdown with Molly's captors in a house of mirrors.

The concept has also been used in comics. In ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'', [[Batman]] is seen chasing the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] through an amusement park and into a hall of mirrors. It was used to create suspense as Joker could not clearly decipher what was real and what was just an image.

=== Film ===

In Charlie Chaplin's 1928 movie [[The_Circus_(film)|The Circus]], [[Charlie Chaplin]] is chased into a mirror maze by a thief and the police. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G09dfRrUxUM Charlie Chaplin Official Youtube Movie Clip: Charlie Chaplin - The Mirror Maze (The Circus)]

In John Boorman's 1974 movie ''[[Zardoz]]'', character "Z" ([[Sean Connery]]) battles against "The Vortex" in a mirror maze.

One of the most famous ending sequences in film history related to a house of mirrors is in ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' starring [[Bruce Lee]]. The finale takes place in a house of mirrors, where Lee learns it is best to smash the glass obstacles to solve his problem and defeat the villain.

''[[John Wick: Chapter 2]]'' (2017) - John Wick ([[Keanu Reeves]]) engages in a chase, gunfight, and climactic knife fight in a multi-floor modern art museum exhibit called "Reflections of the Soul" made of halls, rooms, and stairways lined with mirrors with lights and video screens reflected in them.

=== Music ===
The [[Kraftwerk]] album ''[[Trans-Europe Express (album)|Trans-Europe Express]]'' includes a song called "The Hall of Mirrors". Fusion guitarist [[Allan Holdsworth]] also has a song called "House of Mirrors" of his ''[[Hard Hat Area]]'' album.  The [[Insane Clown Posse]] album ''[[Ringmaster (album)|The Ringmaster]]'' has a song called "House of Mirrors", representing it as one of the attractions of the [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)|Dark Carnival]].

== History ==
The origins of the house of mirrors stem from the hall of mirrors in the [[Palace of Versailles]].

Upon a visit to France to discuss colonial land agreements, [[Peter Stuyvesant]] arrived at the Palace of Versailles and gazed upon the hall of mirrors present in the palace. Peter (or Petris) became determined to bring this amazement to the newly founded colonial city of [[New Amsterdam]], of which he was governor. Peter Stuyvesant's House of Mirrors was founded in 1651 and he charged one [[Dutch gulden]] for admission.

'''La Fémis''' (French: ''École Nationale Supérieure des Métiers de l'Image et du Son'', formerly known as the ''[[Institut des hautes études cinématographiques]]'', IDHEC), is the film and television school of [[PSL Research University]]. ''FEMIS'' is an [[acronym]] for ''Fondation Européenne pour les Métiers de l’Image et du Son''. Based in [[Paris]], it offers courses balanced between artistic research, professional development and technical training.

In 2012, [[The Hollywood Reporter]] rated La fémis no.6 in its best international film school rankings (it included U.S.-based film schools)  and no.3 in its 2014 best international film school rankings (it excluded U.S.-based film schools).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/gallery/thrs-top-25-film-schools-354506#6-la-femis http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/gallery/thrs-top-25-film-schools-354506#6-la-femis] hollywoodreporter.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/study-top-15-international-film-721648&lt;/ref&gt; Its alumni have won three of the world's most prestigious film prizes -  [[Cannes Film Festival]]'s [[Golden Palm]], [[Venice Film Festival]]'s [[Golden Lion]] and [[Berlin International Film Festival]]'s [[Golden Bear]] - ten times, making it the most rewarded [[film school]] in the world, preceding the [[Beijing Film Academy]] and the [[Tisch School of the Arts]] of [[New York City]], in winning those three prizes.

==History==
[[File:Exterior Pathé-Fémis.JPG|thumb|left|290px|La Fémis]]

From 1944 to 1985, the [[IDHEC]] ([[Institut des hautes études cinématographiques]]) was the main French film school — training 1,439 French and foreign film professionals.

In 1985, the school was restructured under the supervision of the then [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]] [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]] and La Fémis was created in 1986. Originally, scriptwriter [[Jean-Claude Carrière]] was its president and [[Jack Gajos]] was its director.

When La Fémis was created, the school had seven teaching departments: direction, screenwriting, picture, sound, editing, production, and set design. A script continuity course was added in 1992 and a distribution/exploitation course in 2003. Lastly the master-class workshop, a European production training program, was co-created with the [[Filmakademie Baden-Württemberg]], Ludwigsburg, Germany in 2002. La Fémis is a full member of [[CILECT]], the international network of film schools.

The school is now a public establishment under the responsibility of the Ministry of culture and communication. The school first opened in the [[Palais de Tokyo]] (Paris 16e), moving on February 15, 1999 to the old ''Rapid Film'' - [[Pathé]] Studios at 6, rue Francoeur (18e). Their founder and French prime class producer [[Bernard Natan]] was deported by the Nazis 1942.

==Curriculum==
[[File:Plateau Fémis.JPG|thumb|upright|270px|La Femis (film set 1)]]
The main curriculum students follow a four-year training course. During the first year, they all follow the same general course: initiation into the various jobs involved in filmmaking, experimenting in every technical position within a film crew.

During the second and third year, they follow a specific curriculum depending on the department they have chosen, including theoretical classes, exercises, days devoted to film analysis, analytical seminars and collective exercises making films. They spend their fourth year fulfilling an individual end-of-studies project (known as "travail de fin d'études" or TFE) and taking part in their classmates' projects.

In sum, the school is designed to foster an applied cinephilia, in which the study of films past and present underwrites advanced skills in the practicalities of filmmaking; returning alumni, like Jean Paul Civeyrac, who come back to themselves lead seminars, carry on this tradition of encouraging advanced auteurist ambitions among the new students.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Tim (2011). Brutal Intimacy: Analyzing Contemporary French Cinema, Wesleyan University Press, Middleton CT. {{ISBN|0-8195-6827-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The school is the subject of a 2016 French film called ''Le Concours (The Graduation)'', directed by Claire Simon about the exhaustive application process to be accepted as a student.

==Alumni==
La Fémis has trained over 700 students in all filmmaking trades: directors, screenwriters, producers, editors, cameramen, sound engineers, decorators, script supervisors, distributors and exhibition managers/executives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2478">A '''loose sentence''' (also called a cumulative sentence) is a type of sentence in which the main idea ([[Clause#Independent and dependent clauses|independent clause]]) is elaborated by the successive addition of modifying clauses or phrases.

==Construction==

It adds modifying elements after the subject, complement, and verb.

==Effect==

Loose sentences may make a work seem informal, relaxed, and conversational.  However, according to Strunk and White's ''[[The Elements of Style]]'' (2000), a succession of loose sentences, especially those of two clauses, is to be avoided because of "mechanical symmetry and sing-song".

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

* "Bells rang, filling the air with their clangor, startling pigeons into flight from every belfry, bringing people into the streets to hear the news." (From the English Reviewer)
* She drove her car to go to the movies, and got gas.
* "I have been assured by a very knowing American friend of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nourished is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked or boiled; and I make no doubt it will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout." Jonathan Swift, [[A Modest Proposal]]

== Alternatives ==
If the writer finds that he has written a series of sentences of the type described, he should recast enough of them to remove the monotony, replacing them by simple sentences, by sentences of two clauses joined by a semicolon, by periodic sentences of two clauses, by sentences, loose or periodic, of three clauses—whichever best represent the real relations of the thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strunk Jr.|first1=William|title=The Elements of Style|date=July 28, 2009|publisher=W L C|isbn=1557427283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if the writer wanted to rewrite the above examples he could write:
* Bells rang. Their resonance filled the air with clangor, startling pigeons into flight from every belfry. Upon hearing the sounds, the townspeople rushed into the streets. They all stood in silence and awaited the news. 
* She drove to the movies. Afterwards she went to the gas station to fill up.

'''''Los únicos''''' ({{lang-es|"The uniques"}}) is a 2011 Argentine superhero live-action television series aired by [[Canal 13 (Argentina)|El Trece]] in the [[prime time]]. The "uniques" are a superhero team working as a [[covert operation]] unit. Main actors are [[Arnaldo André]], [[Mariano Martínez (actor)|Mariano Martínez]] and [[Griselda Siciliani]], the two main supervillains are played by [[Favio Posca]] and [[Carlos Belloso]].

==Premise==
Unlike most productions by Pol-ka, ''Los únicos'' is not a telenovela featuring common people or a vengeance plot.&lt;ref name="Nacion"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1348381-los-unicos |title= Los únicos |first= Marcelo |last= Stiletano |date= 09/02/2011 |publisher= [[La Nación]] |location= [[Buenos Aires]] |language= Spanish |trans-title=The uniques}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it is a crime fiction comedy with [[metafiction]]al elements. As such, it avoids the usual constrains of the plots of the aforementioned genres.&lt;ref name="Nacion"/&gt; The plot is influenced by the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'' and ''[[Sky High (2005 film)|Sky High]]''.&lt;ref name="Nacion"/&gt;

Nicolás Cabré makes a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the ''[[Sin Código]]'' telenovela, playing again his former character of "Axel Etcheverry". In the new plot, the "Nielsen Security" group has gone bankrupt, and Axel blames his former teammate Gabriel Nielsen for it. Nielsen (which was played by [[Adrián Suar]], creator of both series) has appeared a number of times, as well as other characters and references to the former telenovela.

[[Arnaldo André]] composed his character, an experimented leader managing a team, based over his own protective relations with relatives, and the ways TV producers try to motivate him to accept a work. He made a deliberate effort to avoid giving an authoritarian style to the character, to avoid comparisons with his former character at ''[[Valientes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last= André|first= Arnaldo |subjectlink= Arnaldo André|interviewer= Adriana Schettini |title= Arnaldo André: "La televisión me dio todo, todo, todo" |location= [[Buenos Aires]] |date= 2011-02-18 |work= [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín espectáculos]]|accessdate=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The "Uniques" are actually one of several [[covert operation]] units of skilled or superpowered people working at different countries. Alfredo Monterrey organized many of those units, and the series is about the creation and organization of the Argentine branch. His recruits are Diego Rouvier, Axel Etcheverry, María Soledad Marini, Rubén Hagi, Rosario Ahumada, Violeta Morano and Hugo Albarracín. María has [[superhuman strength]], Axel has an unbreakable [[Human skeleton|skeleton]], Rubén Hagi has indestructible skin, and Violeta Morano is [[precognition|precognitive]]. Diego and Rosario have no superhuman powers: Diego is a skilled secret agent, and Rosario a former burglar with a taste for high-stake thefts. The team is opposed by the villains Livio Muzak and Ronco Milevich. Ronco is capable of electric manipulation.

'''Michael Abraham Levy, Baron Levy''', (born 11 July 1944) was a practising Chartered Accountant and Chairman &amp; CEO of a large independent group of music companies, and is a Labour Peer. 

He is the President of Volunteering Matters, Jewish Care, Jewish Free School (JFS) and Jewish Lads' and Girls' Brigade (JLGB).

Levy was the chief fundraiser for the UK Labour Party.  A long-standing friend of former Prime Minister, [[Tony Blair]], Lord Levy spent nine years as Tony Blair's special envoy to the Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6929458.stm |title=UK appoints new Middle East envoy |publisher=BBC News |date=3 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; being replaced by Gordon Brown's appointee, [[Michael Williams, Baron Williams of Baglan|Lord Williams of Baglan]], from September 2007.

==Early life==
Born in [[Stoke Newington]], [[North London]], to devout Jewish immigrant parents of modest means, Levy was educated at Grocers, later known as [[Hackney Downs School]].&lt;ref name=bagman /&gt;

==Music career==
Levy qualified as a Chartered Accountant in 1966 (ACA then FCA) and set up a very successful professional accountancy practice.

The practice attracted a great number of clients in the music and entertainment industry and Levy became a specialist in international copyright and licence.

Amongst the clients were [[the Foundations]], Vanity Fair, Roger Greenaway, Barry Mason and many other successful producers and artists.

Levy founded [[Magnet Records]] with [[Peter Shelley]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="Sweeting"&gt;Adam Sweeting [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/23/alvin-stardust "Alvin Stardust obituary"], ''The Guardian'', 23 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This became one of the most successful independent labels of its day and at one stage had 10% of the British singles market with four singles in the top ten.

The successful artists on the label included [[Adrian Baker]], [[Alvin Stardust]], [[Chris Rea]], [[Bad Manners]], Darts, Susan Cadogan, Silver Convention and [[Guys 'n' Dolls]].

Levy sold Magnet Records to [[Warner Brothers]] in 1988 for [[Pound Sterling|£]]10[[million|m]].

Guitarist Chris Rea said of Levy, "He is extremely tough, one of the hardest bastards I have ever met, but I would leave my children with him rather than anyone else." The [[record producer|music producer]] [[Pete Waterman]] described him as "the greatest salesman I have ever met. He would be able to sell sand to the Arabs."&lt;ref name=bagman /&gt;

After Magnet was sold, Levy set up [[M&amp;G Records]] with backing from [[Polygram Records|Polygram]]. [[M&amp;G Records]] was so named as it was the initials of Michael and his wife Gilda, and featured acts such as [[Zoë (British singer)|Zoe]] who had a top five hit with "Sunshine on a Rainy Day" and [[Pele (English band)|Pele]] who had success with "Fair blows the wind for France". Polygram were then bought out and the company was eventually sold to Bertelsmann (BMG) in 1997.

==Aptitude for fundraising==
Levy was involved in fundraising from his early life and from the late 1960s for many causes including Jewish and Israeli causes. For this he showed a special adeptness, raising, between 1988–1994, [[Pound Sterling|£]]60[[million|m]] for [[Jewish Care]], an amalgam of several Jewish charitable organisations, of which he is now President.&lt;ref name=bagman /&gt; Simon Morris, Chief Executive of Jewish Care, said of Levy that, when it comes to fundraising, "there's no one better in the country."  Levy has been described as the number one fundraiser in the country.

==Political life==
Levy first met Tony Blair at a dinner party in 1994, hosted by Israeli diplomat [[Gideon Meir]],&lt;ref name=bagman&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/mar/19/constitution.partyfunding | title=There was once a jolly bagman | author=Euan Ferguson |publisher=The Observer |location=London |date=19 March 2006 |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the two having a common friend in [[Eldred Tabachnik]], a senior barrister (now a [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] and a former president of the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]]) at [[11 King's Bench Walk Chambers|11 King's Bench Walk]], the chambers founded by [[Derry Irvine, Baron Irvine of Lairg|Derry Irvine]] where Blair had trained in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="magic"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2092803,00.html | title=Lord Cashpoint's touch of money magic | publisher=Sunday Times | date=19 March 2006 | author=Stuart Wavell | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; They soon became close friends and tennis partners.  Levy ran the [[Labour Leader's Office Fund]] to finance Blair's campaign before the 1997 general election and received substantial contributions from such figures as [[Alex Bernstein]] and [[Robert Gavron]], both of whom were ennobled by Blair after he came to power. Levy himself was created a [[life peer]] on 23 September 1997 as '''Baron Levy''', of [[Mill Hill]] in the [[London Borough of Barnet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=54904 |date=29 September 1997 |page=10969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since making his [[maiden speech]] on 3 December 1997, Levy has not spoken in a debate at the [[House of Lords]].

He has been described by ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' as "undoubtedly the notional leader of [[British Jewry]]".&lt;ref name="magic" /&gt; He was a founding member of the [[Jewish Leadership Council]], the leadership of UK Jewish community. Levy has close ties with Israeli political leaders.  His son, [[Daniel Levy (political analyst)|Daniel Levy]], was active in Israeli political life, and has served as an assistant to the former Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]] and to [[Knesset]] member [[Yossi Beilin]]. His son Daniel is now based in the UK and is now President of the US Middle East Project and before that was Head of the Middle East Department of the European Council of Foreign Relations. Levy has praised Blair for his "solid and committed support of the State of Israel"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishcare.org/events/ Jewish Care], Fundraising Dinner 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and "his commitment to the peace process". Levy was associated with the [[Labour Friends of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pierce, Andrew|url=|title=Blair's chance to raise cash for Pounds 1m refund|publisher=The Times|date=18 November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known as "Lord Cashpoint" to some in the media and politics,&lt;ref name="magic" /&gt; he was the leading fundraiser for the Labour Party from 1994 to 2007 (having raised over £100m for the Labour Party.  In 2007 he voluntarily decided to step down at the same time as former Prime Minister Tony Blair. 

In 2000, Levy was criticised when it was revealed that he had paid only £5,000 tax during the financial year 1998–1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Blair tycoon paid just £5,000 tax | publisher=Sunday Times | date=25 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; – however it was subsequently shown even in that year the tax paid was £30,000.  In an interview at the time, repeated on BBC2's Newsnight on 16 March 2006, Levy stated that "Over the years I have paid many millions of tax and, if you average it, each year it comes to many hundreds of thousands of pounds. In that particular year, I was giving my time to the Labour Party and the voluntary sector, and I just lived off capital."&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5173880.stm | title=Profile: Lord Levy | date=12 July 2006 | publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1998 until 2007, he acted as Prime Minister Blair's personal envoy to the Middle East.

Many leaders in the region including Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas have praised Levy for always offering constructive suggestions. Mr Blair has said Lord Levy carried out "a perfectly excellent job as my envoy under very difficult circumstances".

In September 2005, Levy was appointed President of the Council of the [[Specialist Schools and Academies Trust]], the body overseeing the government's [[Specialist school]]s and [[Academy (England)|Academy]] programmes.

===Cash for honours===

Levy was arrested and questioned in connection with the "[[Cash for Honours]]" inquiry by the [[Metropolitan Police]] on 12 July 2006 (whereby it was suggested that money was paid to political parties for Honours in particular peerages).&lt;ref name=police1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5173860.stm |title=Top Labour fundraiser Levy bailed |publisher=BBC News | date=12 July 2006 |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No charges were made against Levy and the police removed all details from their files.

==Personal life==
He and his wife Gilda have a son, Daniel, and a daughter, Juliet.

Levy's home in [[Totteridge]], North London, was [[burglary|burgled]] in 2003. He and his wife Gilda were restrained with handcuffs and had bleach poured over them. Levy was hit on the head with a shovel and had his wrist broken; the attackers fled with £80,000 of cash and jewellery.&lt;ref name="magic" /&gt;

Lord Levy received an Honorary Doctorate from Middlesex University in 1999, and the  Israel Policy Forum (USA) Special Recognition Award in 2003.

'''Nickelodeon Philippines''' is a [[pay television|pay television channel]] that was launched on 1 April 2011 as a localised variant of American channel [[Nickelodeon]], with programming aimed at [[child]]ren and [[Adolescence|teenagers]]. It is owned by [[Viacom International Media Networks Asia]] in partnership with [[All Youth Channels]]. Upon its launch, it replaced the Southeast Asian feed of Nickelodeon in the Philippines, which used to be distributed in the country since its launch in 1996.

In October 11, 2006, [[Viacom]]'s subsidiary [[Viacom Media Networks|MTV Networks Asia Pacific]] set up a new unit to manage Nickelodeon's southeast Asia operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viacom.com/view_release.jhtml;jsessionid=APLJH3MQVAW1CCQBAFLA4CY?inID=10000007&amp;inReleaseID=227417 MTV Networks Asia Pacific Announces A New Structure To Advance Its Localization Strategy], Viacom, 11 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nick.com/all_nick/everything_nick/intl_home.jhtml Nick Asia &amp; World History]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, 2011, MTV Networks launched a dedicated Filipino Nickelodeon channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=650212&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=85 Nickelodeon launches dedicated channel to Filipino Kids]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===1996–2011: As part of Nickelodeon Southeast Asia===
In October 1996, Nickelodeon decided to reach the popular channel to the [[Philippines]], [[Japan]] and [[Russia]] as an attempt to bring the popular channel to Asia. One of their shorts were Right Here, Right Now (based on the 1993 Nick USA shorts) and their ID's were by [[Front TV|FRONT]]. In 2003, it became a part of Nicksplat (Nickelodeon's headquarters in Asia).

On October 11, 2006, [[Viacom]]'s subsidiary [[MTV Networks]] Asia Pacific set up a new unit to manage [[Nickelodeon (Southeast Asia)]] TV based in [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viacom.com/view_release.jhtml;jsessionid=APLJH3MQVAW1CCQBAFLA4CY?inID=10000007&amp;inReleaseID=227417 "MTV Networks Asia Pacific Announces A New Structure To Advance Its Localization Strategy"], Viacom, 11 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Nickelodeon was launched in [[Singapore]] and expanded its services in [[Southeast Asia]], [[South Asia]], and [[Polynesia]]. Nickelodeon [[Philippines]], Nickelodeon [[Pakistan]], and Nickelodeon [[India]] started working independently. They started their new website in 2003.

On March 15, 2010, Nickelodeon revamped their logo same as the [[United States]] and worldwide and started broadcasting newer Nickelodeon shows from the United States that represents the new Nickelodeon logo and airs latest episodes of current Nick shows.

===2011–present: Nickelodeon Philippines===
On April 1, 2011, the Nickelodeon Asia feed was replaced with a dedicated Filipino Nickelodeon channel, although it will still use the Nick-Asia branding used in other countries. On April 11, 2011, the lineup was changed prior to Nickelodeon Southeast Asia. The new schedule will put live-action programs in the primetime slot and will double the [[Nick Jr. (Southeast Asia)|Nick Jr.]] block.

Nickelodeon celebrated the release of the new channel on April 9, 2011 on the [[Fort Bonifacio|Bonifacio Global City]], Open Field, [[Taguig|Taguig City]] with the event entitled, "Nick World". The event included mascots of notable [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]] characters with storytelling, an animals show, martial arts performances and a world of exciting attractions, booths, and modules for kids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nickelodeonphilippines.webs.com/apps/blog/show/6480379-celebrate-nickelodeon-philippines-with-nick-world Celebrate Nickelodeon Philippines With Nick World]&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting on May 23, 2011, the lineup of Nickelodeon will once again change where they will cease airing the Nick Jr. block in the afternoon timeslot and will be replaced by live-action shows and miscellaneous NickToons programs. This lineup will double the TeenNick block which only runs in the evening and other animated shows that only airs once a day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nickelodeonphilippines.webs.com/apps/blog/show/6698072-nick-philippines-newest-episodes-and-timeslots-this-may- Nick Philippines' Newest Episodes And Timeslots This May!]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Nickelodeon uses new graphics used in the US and UK, however it only applies to selected programs' promos and station IDs. The former Nick-Asia graphics is still used.

In 2015, Nickelodeon Philippines introduced Hapon Hangout, A Nickelodeon hour special that starts at 4:00pm to 6:30pm every weekdays.

On July 17, 2017, the channel was rebranded into the US version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-O0_DnM0N4 |title=Rebrand 2017 Launch Ident|work=StarRion20 Second Channel|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made by Superestudio, an Argentina branding agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/nickelodeon-unveils-rebranding-985083 |title=Nickelodeon Unveils Rebranding |first=Kate|last=Stanhope|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|date=March 10, 2017|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nickelodeon Philippines Kids Choice Awards==
{{Main|Nickelodeon Philippines Kids' Choice Awards}}

The '''Philippines Kids Choice Awards''' is the second setting of the Kids Choice Awards in Asia preceded by [[Indonesia]]. The show was first held since 2008 at the [[Aliw Theater]] in [[Pasay]] and was first hosted by [[Michael V.]] and some various [[Filipinos|Filipino]] artists. [[Nickelodeon (TV network)|Nickelodeon]], an American cable television network, brought Kids' Choice Awards to the Philippines in an effort to strengthen its presence in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celebritypeeps.com/winners-of-1st-nickelodeon-kids-choice-awards-philippines, Winners of Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, 29 November 2008], [http://kca.nicksplat.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305234758/http://kca.nicksplat.com/|date=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Amit Jain, executive Vice-President and managing director of [[Viacom Media Networks|MTV Networks]] India, China and Southeast Asia, "This is a milestone for Nickelodeon's business in Southeast Asia as it will deliver on Nick's commitment
of providing global kids-centric shows and properties which are adapted to reflect local tastes and aspirations." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldscreen.com/newscurrent.php?filename=kidschoice11248.htm, Kids' Choice Awards Set for Indonesia, Philippines]&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippines KCA has been inactive all over the years.

==Nickelodeon on free-to-air television==
Prior to the launch of Nickelodeon Philippines in the fall of 1998, Nickelodeon first aired in the country as a block of the [[free-to-air]] State-owned TV channel [[People's Television Network|PTV]] until 1992. The block used to air in the mornings and afternoons mostly educational, drama-related programmes and game shows. Then, it moved to [[Radio Philippines Network|New Vision 9]] until 1998, and again from 2003 to 2006 as RPN. During that time, [[GMA Network]] purchased the rights to air ''[[Rugrats]]'' and selected [[Nick Jr. (Southeast Asia)|Nick Jr.]] shows from 1998 to 2006.

[[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]] lost its broadcasting rights of airing Nickelodeon shows to [[TV5 (Philippines)|ABC]] in 2006. Nick shows were later dubbed for the first time to [[Filipino language|Filipino]] on August 11, 2008 (with the exception of ''[[Go, Diego, Go!]]''), making it the first national network to do so. Later rebranded as TV5, the channel ended its contract with Nickelodeon on June 30, 2010, months after it was purchased by [[PLDT]]'s [[MediaQuest Holdings]] from the Cojuangco group and Malaysia-based broadcaster [[Media Prima Berhad]] which caused a major reshuffle in the TV5's programming. ''[[Yo Gabba Gabba!]]'', also a Nickelodeon production, was the only Nick program retained by TV5 after losing its rights to [[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]]. Although produced by Nickelodeon, it wasn't dubbed to Filipino as the contract have been already expired.

''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' was also aired on [[Q (TV network)|Q]] (now [[GMA News TV]]) weekday mornings until February 18, 2011 when the network was discontinued. It wasn't dubbed in Filipino either.

[[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]] launched ''Nick Time'' (later Nickelodeon on ABS-CBN) on July 26, 2010 at under their ''Team Animazing'' timeblock. Nickelodeon shows such as ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'', ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron]]'', and ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' among others are shown during Nick Time, thus continuing the Filipino dub that was started by TV5. However, ABS-CBN's airing of Nickelodeon's shows was criticized for having majority of episodes edited due to time constraints, heavy advertising gaps and ABS-CBN's importance to local programming. ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' ended on June 24, 2011 while ''[[The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron]]'', ''Avatar: The Legend of Aang'' and ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' ended last October 8, 2011 and replaced by ''[[Go, Diego, Go!]]'', ''[[The Penguins of Madagascar]]'' and ''[[El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera]]'' on October 15, 2011. After a week, ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' goes back to air.

[[Studio 23]], ABS-CBN's former affiliate, launched ''Nickelodeon on Studio 23'' on October 4, 2010. Like its mother station ABS-CBN, programs are dubbed in Tagalog. As of now,{{when|date=July 2017}} there are no plans to air shows such as ''[[iCarly]]'' on either network, despite its popularity. [[Studio 23]] launched ''[[Catscratch]]'' that premiered last August 2011. The Nickelodeon on [[Studio 23]] block temporarily ended in October 2011 and returned in January 2012.

After 3 years, Nickelodeon on Studio 23 ended airing its block on January 16, 2014 to pave way for Channel 23's relaunch as [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action|ABS-CBN Sports+Action]] (currently known as '''S+A'''), a sports-oriented channel. To allow smooth transition of the new channel, Nickelodeon on ABS-CBN Sports+Action was launched last January 20, 2014 and all of its shows are reverted to its original English language rather than Filipino-dubbed. Since the launch of ABS-CBN's digital black box [[ABS-CBN TV Plus]] in 2015, it is no longer seen on ABS-CBN Sports+Action. Currently, the network's digital channel ''[[Yey!]]'' carries all Nickelodeon &amp; [[Nick Jr. (Southeast Asia)|Nick Jr.]] shows (under the ''Nickelodeon sa Yey!'' banner) in Filipino-dubbed audio, with notable exception of shows like ''[[Peppa Pig]]''. The said block paved way the introduction of ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' (currently the second longest active Nick cartoon show after ''SpongeBob SquarePants'') to free television in summer of 2018. Some shows are still being aired on the main channel on weekends.

==Programming==
Nickelodeon airs new programs and episodes of current Nick shows every 2–7 months after the US broadcast but sometimes takes a year. The program lineup is different from the Nick-Asia feed where live-action programs are aired twice in the afternoon and evening and the Nick Jr. block runs longer. Along with the announcement of the dedicated feed, there were several shows announced to be premiering on Nickelodeon this year such as ''[[Bubble Guppies]]'', ''[[House of Anubis]]'', ''[[The Fresh Beat Band]]'', ''[[Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness]]'' and ''[[T.U.F.F. Puppy]]''. Original Nickelodeon and [[Nick Jr.]] titles still remains in the channel. The Loud House's Chinese dub available in  Malaysia and Singapore via SAP (Second Audio).

===Programming blocks===
Programming in Nickelodeon Philippines also in Southeast Asia has often been segmented into blocks.
* '''Nick Jr.''' (Weekdays, 6am - 12noon, Weekends 6am - 9am) is a preschool block that airs children oriented programs. The programing block is now available as a channel in the Philippines on [[Sky Cable]] Channel 103 and [[G Sat]] channel 22.
* '''Hapon Hangout''' (Weekdays, 4pm-6pm) ([[English language|English]]: ''Afternoon Hangout'') is a programming block that airs animated and live-action series every weekday afternoon. The name derives from the word ''Hapon'' which is usually said by the Filipinos to indicate the afternoon.

====Former blocks====
* '''TEENick''' was a programming block that airs current live-action programs. This doesn't exist anymore in the channel, this is due to the fact that the TeeNick shows are aired along with Nickelodeon.
* '''Weekend Express''' was a programming block that runs every weekends at noon. The block airs programs according to a weekly theme. The block ended on June 26, 2011 together with [[Nickelodeon (Southeast Asia)]].
* '''Lunch Toons''' was a Nicktoon-based block which shows random one Nicktoon which is repeated when airing with various episodes of the show that food is more interested in the episode. '''This is a limited block.'''

===Short segments===
* '''Nick Tunes''' is a segment that Nicktoons-related music videos air on the segment. Nick Tunes only appeared in commercial breaks. This was in hiatus from late 2011 to April 2, 2012. The segment is shown sometimes. The segment includes the Nicktoons: ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'', ''[[Back at the Barnyard]]'' (now formerly appeared in the segment) and many selected Nicktoons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2229">'''Norman Crider''' (August 29, 1938, in [[Lordsburg, New Mexico]] – August 19, 2009, in Indianapolis) was a baton-twirling champion and proprietor of the Ballet Shop near [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]] in New York. He also owned a gallery-bookshop on Madison Avenue where in 1977 he held an acclaimed exhibition on prima ballerina [[Anna Pavlova]].

In 1957 Crider performed with batons in an [[ice show]] at the [[Hilton Hotels|Conrad Hilton Hotel]] in Chicago, at which time he began to study ballet. Two years later he developed a nightclub act combining ballet and baton-twirling which he took to Europe. He taught twirling to French and Italian schoolchildren for the next eight years and was awarded the [[Order of Cultural Merit and Philanthropy]] by the French government.

Besides the Ballet Shop, Crider founded the Antiques Center of America, on the East Side of Manhattan, and owned shops in the [[Trump Tower]] and La Boutique Fantasque at [[Rockefeller Center]]. After the Ballet Shop closed in 1996, he opened a shop in [[Winter Park, Florida]], which was located next to [[Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art |The Morse Museum of American Art]], before moving to Indianapolis.

{{literature}}
A '''play''' is a form of [[literature]] written by a [[playwright]], usually consisting of [[dialogue]] and singing between [[Character (arts)|characters]], intended for [[theatre|theatrical]] [[performance]] rather than just [[Reading (process)|reading]]. Plays are performed at a variety of levels, from [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], [[Off-Broadway]], [[Regional theater in the United States|regional theater]], to [[Community theatre]], as well as university or school productions. There are rare dramatists, notably [[George Bernard Shaw]], who have had little preference as to whether their plays were performed or read. The term "play" can refer to both the written texts of playwrights and to their complete theatrical performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/play "Play"]: [[Dictionary.com]] website.

===Comedy===
{{Main article|Comedy}}
Comedies are plays which are designed to be humorous. Comedies are often filled with witty remarks, unusual characters, and strange circumstances. Certain comedies are geared toward different age groups. [[Comedy|Comedies]] were one of the two original play types of [[Ancient Greece]], along with tragedies. An example of a comedy would be [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', or for a more modern example the skits from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref name="anarchon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anarchon.tripod.com/indexGREEKTH.html|title=THE ANCIENT GREEK DRAMA &amp; THEATRE HISTORY PAGE|publisher=anarchon.tripod.com|accessdate=2008-06-16|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theatrehist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatrehistory.com/ancient/bates001.html|title=Origin of Comedy|publisher=www.theatrehistory.com|accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Farce====
{{Main article|Farce}}
A generally nonsensical genre of play, [[farce]]s are often acted and often involve  humor. An example of a farce includes [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'', or [[Mark Twain]]'s play ''[[Is He Dead?]]''.

====Satirical====
{{Main article|Satire}}
A [[satirical|satire]] play takes a comic look at current events  people while at the same time attempting to make a political or social statement, for example pointing out [[corruption]]. An example of a satire would be [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s ''[[The Government Inspector]]'' and [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[Lysistrata]]''. Satire plays are generally one of the most popular forms of comedy, and often considered to be their own genre entirely.

====Restoration comedy====
{{Main article|Restoration comedy}}
Restoration comedy is a genre that explored relationships between men and women, and was considered risqué in its time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vernon|first1=P.F.|title=Marriage of Convenience and the Moral Code of Restoration Comedy|journal=Essays of Criticism|date=1962|pages=370–387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters featured in restoration comedy included stereotypes of all kinds, and these same stereotypes were found in most plays of this genre, so much so that most plays were very similar in message and content.  However, since restoration comedy dealt with unspoken aspects of relationships, it created a type of connection between audience and performance that was more informal and private.

It is commonly agreed that restoration comedy has origins in [[Molière]]’s theories of comedy, but differs in intention and tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ornament of Action|date=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The inconsistency between restoration comedy’s morals and the morals of the era is something that often arises during the study of this genre.  This may give clues as to why, despite its original success, restoration comedy did not last long in the seventeenth century.  However, in recent years, it has become a topic of interest for theatre theorists, who have been looking into theatre styles that have their own conventions of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Styan|first1=J.L.|title=Restoration Comedy in Performance|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tragedy===
{{Main article|Tragedy}}
These plays contain darker themes such as death and disaster. Often the [[protagonist]] of the play has a [[tragic flaw]], a trait which leads to their downfall. Tragic plays convey all emotions and have very dramatic conflicts. [[Tragedy]] was one of the two original play types of Ancient Greece. Some examples of tragedies include William Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'', and also [[John Webster]]'s play ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]''.&lt;ref name="anarchon" /&gt;

===Historical===
{{Main article|History (theatrical genre)}}
[[File:An actress performs a play in front of 2 statues from the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. Room 21, the British Museum, London.jpg|thumb|An actress performs a play in front of 2 statues from the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. Room 21, the British Museum, London]]
[[File:NMT Automatic performing a play in front of the Nereid Monument.jpg|thumb|An actor and actress performing a play in front of the Nereid Monument, Room 17, the British Museum, London]]
These plays focus on actual historical events. They can be tragedies or comedies, but are often neither of these. [[History]] as a separate genre was popularized by [[William Shakespeare]]. Examples of historical plays include [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[Demetrius (play)|Demetrius]]'' and William Shakespeare's ''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=V3b2tlWBBUsC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=%22Shakespeare+popularised%22+historical+play | title=The Three Richards: Richard I ... - Google Book Search|publisher=books.google.co.uk|accessdate=2008-06-17|last=|first=| isbn=978-1-85285-521-5| year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical theatre===
{{Main article|Musical theatre}}
Ballad opera, a popular theatre style at the time, was the first style of musical to be performed in the American colonies.  The first musical of American origin was premiered in Philadelphia in 1767, and was called “The Disappointment”, however, this play never made it to production.  Around the 1920s, theatre styles were beginning to be defined more clearly.  For musical theatre, this meant that composers gained the right to create every song in the play, and these new plays were held to more specific conventions, such as thirty-two-bar songs.  When the Great Depression came, many people left Broadway for Hollywood, and the atmosphere of Broadway musicals changed significantly. A similar situation occurred during the 1960s, when composers were scarce and musicals lacked vibrancy and entertainment value.

By the 1990s, there were very few original Broadway musicals, as many were recreations of movies or novels.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bordman|first1=Gerald|title=American Musical Theatre|date=1978|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musical productions have songs to help explain the story and move the ideas of the play along. They are usually accompanied by dancing. Musicals can be very elaborate in settings and actor performances. Examples of musical productions include ''Wicked'' and ''Fiddler on the Roof''.

===Theatre of Cruelty===
This theatre style originated in the 1940s when Antonin Artaud hypothesized about the effects of expressing through the body as opposed to “by socially conditioned thought.”  In 1946, he wrote a preface to his works in which he explained how he came to write what and the way he did.

Above all, Artaud did not trust language as a means of communication.  Plays within the genre of theatre of cruelty are abstract in convention and content.  Artaud wanted his plays to have an effect and accomplish something.  His intention was to symbolise the subconscious through bodily performances, as he did not believe language could be effective.  Artaud considered his plays to be an enactment rather than a re-enactment, which meant he believed his actors were in reality, rather than re-enacting reality.

His plays dealt with heavy issues such as patients in psych wards, and Nazi Germany.  Through these performances, he wanted to “make the causes of suffering audible”, however, audiences originally reacted poorly, as they were so taken aback by what they saw.  Much of his work was banned in France at the time.

Artaud did not believe that conventional theatre of the time would allow the audience to have a cathartic experience and help heal the wounds of World War II.  For this reason, he moved towards radio-based theatre, in which the audience could use their imagination to connect the words they were hearing to their body.  This made his work much more personal and individualized, which he believed would increase the effectiveness of portraying suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finter|first1=Helga|last2=Griffin|first2=Matthew|title=Antonin Artaud and the Impossible Theatre: The Legacy of the Theatre of Cruelty|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|pages=15–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre of the Absurd===
Theatre of the Absurd: This genre generally includes metaphysical representations of existential qualms and questions.  Theatre of the absurd denies rationality, and embraces the inevitability of falling into the abyss of the human condition.  Instead of discussing these issues, however, theatre of the absurd is a demonstration of them.  This leaves the audience to discuss and question the content of the play for themselves.

One of the main aspects of theatre of the absurd is the physical contradiction to language.  Oftentimes, the dialogue between characters will directly oppose their actions.

Famous playwrights within this genre include Beckett, Sartre, Ionesco, Adamov, and Genet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Esslin|first1=Martin|title=Theatre of the Absurd|date=2001|isbn=1-4000-7523-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The term "play" can be either a general term, or more specifically refer to a non-musical play. Sometimes the term "straight play" is used in contrast to "[[musical theatre|musical]]", which refers to a play based on [[music]], [[dance]], and [[song]]s sung by the play's characters. For a short play, the term "playlet" is sometimes used.

'''Sooklek''' (or Suklek, {{lang-th|ศุขเล็ก}}) is a Thai cartoon character created by [[Prayoon Chanyavongs]] in the ''[[likay]]'' style. He is characterized by a "jaunty feather stuck in a band around his head and carrying a sword in one hand." &lt;ref name="Sunday"&gt;{{cite journal | author= Pholdhampalit, Khetsirin  |title= From paper to pan| newspaper=The Sunday Nation| url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/sunday/From-paper-to-pan-30273413.html| date=November 22, 2015 |accessdate=November 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prayoon's son was named after this character.&lt;ref name="Lent"&gt;{{cite book | editor=Lent, John A. | title=Southeast Asian Cartoon Art: History, Trends and Problems | publisher=McFarland| year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sooklek was first popularized as the titular role in the [[Animated series|cartoon series]] ''Prince Chantarakob'' (จันทโครพ) and eventually became a public personality as creator Prayoon used the character in his satirical cartoons. His name means "happy, good fellow".&lt;ref name="RM Book"&gt;{{cite journal | editor=Balgos, Cecile C.A. | title= Prayoon Chanyavongs| work=Great Men and Women of Asia: Ramon Magsaysay Awardees from Southeast Asia 1958–1973 | publisher=Anvil| year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Field Marshall [[Thanom Kittikachorn]] gave out an order for Prayoon to stop his [[Editorial cartoon|political cartoons]] in 1968, Sooklek was drawn with lips sewn together. Another warning from the government brought about change in Sooklek as the sewn lips were replaced by a big mustache. Sooklek regained his mouth with the ouster of Thanom in 1973.&lt;ref name="Lent"/&gt;

==Adaptation==
An [[Animated series|animation series]] in both 2D and 3D has been produced with Sooklek in the starring role. A commemorative book has also been launched by the Prayoon Foundation. The book is divided into two sections with the first focusing on Sooklek and the second about Prayoon's life and works.

To commemorate Prayoon's centenary, the [[Thailand Post]] launched a sheet of stamps. In addition, a local brand is producing T-shirts featuring Sooklek characters with part of the proceeds going to Prayoon Foundation.&lt;ref name="Sunday"/&gt;

'''''Struggle Street''''' is an [[Australia]]n [[documentary]] series that first aired on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS One]] on 6 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tvtonight.com.au/2015/04/airdate-struggle-street.html|title=Airdate: Struggle Street|date=12 April 2015|work=tvtonight.com.au|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second series began airing on 28 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tvtonight.com.au/2017/11/returning-struggle-street.html|title=Returning: Struggle Street|date=16 November 2017|work=tvtonight.com.au|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
The series sheds light on the struggles and aspirations of residents in [[Public housing in Australia|public housing]] areas around [[Western Sydney]]; areas which have been commonly associated with high unemployment, drug use and problems with the law.

KEO Films, the production company behind the project stated on their website:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Struggle Street|url=http://www.keofilms.com.au/index/#/strugglestreet/|website=keofilms.com.au|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this proposed 3-part observational documentary series, to be filmed over a 6-month period, we’ll feature the voices and stories of people living on the outskirts of Sydney, in some of our most socially-disadvantaged communities.

We’ll highlight the enormous challenges they face being born into generational disadvantage, and then being blamed by the system for their lack of progress.

...And rather than being an exercise in voyeurism, or a fleeting judgmental report, this extended insight into the lives of our subjects will - we hope - provoke not just a change in public perception, but a debate about the direction of public policy as well&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==
The series received strong criticism from local governments, with the [[City of Blacktown|Mayor of Blacktown]], Stephen Bali labelling it as 'poverty porn'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aubusson|first1=Kate|title=Mt Druitt community leaders hurt, angry and feeling sick after Struggle Street documentary|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/mt-druitt-community-leaders-hurt-angry-and-feeling-sick-after-struggle-street-documentary-20150506-ggvtff.html|accessdate=8 May 2015|agency=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locals attempted to boycott the series by establishing a blockade of garbage trucks outside the SBS headquarters in [[Artarmon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Struggle Street: Garbage truck protest against SBS 'poverty porn' documentary|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-06/garbage-truck-protest-again-sbs-reality-tv-struggle-street/6448012|accessdate=8 May 2015|agency=ABC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series aired as planned, winning its timeslot nationally and was the most watched program on television that night in Sydney, with the controversy claimed for the record ratings.

Western Sydney locals are contemplating legal action against the producers to seek damages for defamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Auerbach|first1=Taylor|title=Struggle Street: Featured Western Sydney locals set to sue SBS over their portrayal|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/struggle-street-featured-western-sydney-locals-set-to-sue-sbs-over-their-portrayal/story-fni0cx12-1227344685802|accessdate=8 May 2015|agency=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SBS chief content officer Helen Kellie defended the program, stating that "We are confident that ''Struggle Street'' is a fair and accurate portrayal of events that occurred during filming...further, we believe the series fairly reflects the program description contained in participant release forms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koziol|first1=Michael|title=SBS investigates allegations over Struggle Street documentary|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/sbs-investigates-allegations-over-struggle-street-documentary-20150506-ggvfpm.html|accessdate=8 May 2015|agency=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several television critics and journalists viewed the show in a positive light, arguing that the outrage and controversy over the program was grossly overstated, and praised the show for bringing light to stories that otherwise wouldn't be told in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galvin|first1=Nick|title=SBS show Struggle Street: Why you should watch tonight|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/sbs-show-struggle-street-why-you-should-watch-tonight-20150513-gh0s16.html|accessdate=4 February 2016|agency= Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Season==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2118">Television in the United Arab Emirates began in 1969.

==Overview==
In 2011, the [[United Arab Emirates]] was the main headquarters to 72 free-to-air channels, falling slightly behind Egypt and Saudi Arabia in terms of the total number of channels within the Arab world. The United Arab Emirates also had 16 terrestrial channels, of which 13 are state-owned.&lt;ref name=amo12&gt;{{cite web|title=Arab Media Outlook 2011-2015|url=http://www.arabmediaforum.ae/userfiles/EnglishAMO.pdf|pages=168-170|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Approximately 50% of viewers spend between one and three hours watching TV per day. Emirati nationals watch the highest amount of television, with 53% watching between three and six hours per day.&lt;ref name="amo12"/&gt;

[[Middle East Broadcasting Center|MBC]] channels are the most watched, particularly among expat Arabs, while [[Zee TV]] remains at the top among other expats due to the strong preponderance of South Asians in this group. [[Abu Dhabi TV]] is also a popular choice.&lt;ref name="amo12"/&gt;

[[IPTV]] penetration was estimated at 33% in 2011. Although free-to-air television remains dominant, there has been an increase in the uptake of pay-TV, which is estimated at around 45%.&lt;ref name="amo12"/&gt;

'''''The Disobedient Child''''' is a theatrical [[Comedy (drama)|comic]] [[Morality play|interlude]] written c.[[1560 in literature|1560]] by [[Thomas Ingelend]] (an author who is known only as a "late student of [[Cambridge]]", as described on the first edition's title-page) and first performed in a Tudor hall.&lt;ref name="s"&gt;Southern (1973, 467-469).&lt;/ref&gt;

This play contains the famous line: "[[None is so deaf as who will not hear]]."

==Morality play==
It deals with the subject of the proper disciplinary treatment of children, raising the threat of the evil of those raised without strict discipline. It portrays a young man who is eager to marry despite his father's objections, and the unhappiness of his subsequent married life. The moral of its story is "you've made your bed, now lie in it." It ends with a song to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]].

The printed edition by Thomas Colwell is without date, but it was published about the year 1560. "The source," writes Tucker Brooke, "from which Ingelend derived the rough framework of his play is a prose dialogue of the French Latinist [[Ravisius Textor]] (Jean Tixier de Ravisi, 1480-1524); but Textor's scant two hundred and thirty-five lines of question and answer between a colorless Pater Juvenis and Uxor are expanded, in the fifteen hundred lines of the English work, into a drama of much higher intensity and literary merit than the original in any way suggested."&lt;ref&gt;Tucker Brooke (1911, 126).&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Funniest Joke in the World'''" (also "'''Joke Warfare'''" and "'''Killer Joke'''") is a ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' [[comedy]] [[sketch comedy|sketch]]. The premise of the sketch is that the joke is so funny that anyone who reads or hears it promptly [[Death from laughter|dies from laughter]].

The sketch appeared in the first episode of the [[television]] show ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' ("[[List of Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes|Whither Canada]]"), first shown on 5 October 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus: All the Words, Volume One | first1 = Graham | last1 = Chapman | first2 = John | last2 = Cleese | first3 = Terry | last3 = Gilliam | first4 = Eric | last4 = Idle | first5 = Terry | last5 = Jones | first6 = Michael | last6 = Palin | editor-first = Roger | editor-last = Wilmut | year = 1989 | publisher = Pantheon Books | location = New York, New York | isbn = 0-679-72647-0 | page = 320 (Appendix)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The German translation of the joke in the sketch is made of various meaningless, German-sounding [[nonce word]]s, and so it does not have an English translation.

==Summary==
The sketch is framed in a documentary style and opens with Ernest Scribbler ([[Michael Palin]]), a [[United Kingdom|British]] "writer of jokes", creating the funniest joke in the world only to die laughing. His mother ([[Eric Idle]]) finds the joke, reads it and also immediately dies laughing. A brave [[Scotland Yard]] inspector ([[Graham Chapman]]) attempts to retrieve the joke, with the playing of very sombre music on gramophone records and the chanting of laments by fellow policemen to create a depressing mood. The inspector leaves the flat with the joke but also dies from laughter.

The [[British Army]] wish to determine "the military potential of the Killer Joke".&lt;ref name="words"/&gt; They test the joke on a rifleman ([[Terry Jones]]), who snickers and falls dead on the range. They then translate it into [[German language|German]], with each translator working on only one word of the joke for their own safety (one translator saw two words of the joke and had to be hospitalised). The German "translation" (in reality mostly just [[nonsense words]]) is used for the first time on 8 July 1944 in the [[Ardennes]], causing German soldiers to fall down dead from laughter:
{{quote|Wenn ist das Nunstück git und Slotermeyer? Ja! Beiherhund das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput!&lt;ref name="words"&gt;''All the Words: Volume One''. pp. 10–14.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;!--This quote is taken verbatim from a published script and should not be "corrected". --&gt;

The German version is described as being "over 80,000 times as powerful as Britain's great pre-war joke"&lt;ref name="words"/&gt; (at this point a newsreel of Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] waving his "Peace of paper" appears on screen). The joke is then used in open warfare, with [[Tommy Atkins|Tommies]] running through an open field amid artillery fire shouting the joke at the Germans, who die laughing in response. Afterward, a German [[field hospital]] is shown with uncontrollably laughing German soldiers in bandages, presumably having heard some parts of the joke. 

In a subsequent scene, a British officer from the Joke Brigade (Palin) has been taken prisoner and is being interrogated by [[Gestapo]] officers. The British officer uses the joke to escape as his German captors die laughing, with one German officer (Cleese) insisting the joke isn't funny before finally cracking up and then uttering a [[Woody Woodpecker]]-style laugh before expiring.

The Germans attempt counter-jokes. For example, film is shown of [[Adolf Hitler]] supposedly saying "My dog has no nose", then a German soldier asking "How does he smell?", with Hitler replying "Awful!" Eventually their best "V-joke" (in reference to the [[V-1 flying bomb]]) is attempted on a [[radio broadcast]]: "Der ver zwei peanuts, valking down der strasse, und von vas assaulted...peanut. Ohohohoho!"&lt;ref name="words" /&gt; Although the joke is followed triumphantly by the German anthem ''[[Deutschland über alles]]'', the attack is ineffective.

The British joke is said to have been laid to rest when "Peace broke out" at the end of the war, and countries agree to a Joke Warfare ban at the [[Geneva Convention]].&lt;ref name="words" /&gt; In 1950, the last copy of the joke is sealed under a monument in the [[Berkshire]] countryside, bearing the inscription "[[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|To the Unknown Joke]]". Thus, the English version of the joke is never revealed to the audience.

The footage of Adolf Hitler is taken from [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s film ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''. The section (about 34 minutes into the film) where [[Konstantin Hierl]] presents the [[Reichsarbeitsdienst|Reich Labor Corps]] to Hitler is the source of the speech used for the joke. The first clip shows Hitler saying ''{{lang|de|Inbesondere keiner mehr in Deutschland leben wird...}}'' ("In particular, no one will live in Germany anymore [without working for their country]"), subtitled "My dog has no nose". In the film, the camera cuts briefly away from Hitler; the punchline of the joke is the next shot that shows Hitler's face: "Awful". The original words are ''{{lang|de|eure Schule}}'', from "[The whole nation will go through] your school". "How does he smell?" is from a scene just before Hitler's speech; the original German is ''{{lang|de|Wir sind des Reiches junge Mannschaft!}}'', "We are the Reich's young men!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | title=Triumph of the Will | date=1935 | people=Leni Riefenstahl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precursors==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2017}}
[[Robert W. Chambers]]'s 1895 short story collection ''[[The King in Yellow]]'' has a recurring motif of a play (named "The King in Yellow") which causes all who read it to go mad.

[[Mark Twain]]'s story "[[A Literary Nightmare]]" (also published as  "Punch, Brothers, Punch!") tells of a jingle so catchy that, upon hearing it, the listener cannot stop repeating it until it is passed on to someone else.
 
[[Lord Dunsany]]'s 1916 story "The Three Infernal Jokes", published in the collection ''[[The Last Book of Wonder|Tales of Wonder]]'', concerns jokes that kill those who hear them.

The 1943 war-time story "Nothing But Gingerbread Left", by science fiction writer [[Henry Kuttner]], has a very close premise. Rather than a joke, a marching song (in German) is used as a weapon against the German soldiers. Engineered by American [[linguists]], it is by design such a [[Ohrwurm|catchy song]] that the soldiers cannot stop singing it, and eventually they can think of nothing else. At the climax, [[Adolf Hitler]] is ready to deliver a critically important speech, but begins chanting the marching song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://henrykuttner.bravehost.com/Kuttner,%20Henry%20-%20Nothing%20But%20Gingerbread%20Left.html |author= Kuttner, Henry |title= Nothing But Gingerbread Left |year= 1943 |publisher= bravehost.com |accessdate= August 24, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314223346/http://henrykuttner.bravehost.com/Kuttner,%20Henry%20-%20Nothing%20But%20Gingerbread%20Left.html |archivedate=March 14, 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A story that ran for several weeks in the Sunday comics of ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' during 1967 concerned the creation of a joke, never actually revealed, that was so funny that anyone who heard it immediately died laughing. For safety reasons, government agents somehow decided to keep the joke hidden in the protective custody of [[Li'l Abner#Main characters|Abner Yokum]]. Meanwhile, comedian [[Bob Hope]] learns of the existence of this "Funniest Joke in the World", but not about its deadly effects, and decides that he wants to recite it on his next television show. He procures the joke from Abner, and the government agents learn of this development too late to prevent him from reading it on national television. It turns out, however, that before Bob Hope obtained the joke from him, Abner had read the joke, not understood it, and substituted his own favourite joke. It is this joke that Bob Hope reads on the air, to no harmful effect whatsoever.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==In other works==
The sketch was later remade in a shorter version for the film ''[[And Now for Something Completely Different]]''. It is also available on the [[CD-ROM]] [[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life (video game)|video game version]] of the film ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]''.

If the German version of the joke is entered into [[Google Translate]], instead of an English translation the program returns “[FATAL ERROR]”.

'''''The Reporters''''' is an American [[newsmagazine]] television program that aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX Television]] during the [[1988-89 United States network television schedule|1988–89]] and [[1989-90 United States network television schedule|1989–90]] seasons.

==Format==
''The Reporters'' was structured much in the style of the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] program ''[[A Current Affair (U.S. TV program)|A Current Affair]]'', except that there was no regular "host" role. As ''A Current Affair'' was produced for syndication by Fox, there was a considerable overlap in subject matter and some reporters even appeared on both programs. The premiere episode asked if [[Mike Tyson]] (whose marriage to [[Robin Givens]] was tabloid fodder at the time) was really gay.

Some segments from the program have since been seen in the present day in a historical context on [[Fox News Channel]] as part of their compilation series, ''From the Fox Files''.

[[R. W. Paul]] presented Britain's second [[movie projector|film projector]], and the first commercially produced 35mm projector, the Theatrograph, on 20 February 1896. It was first demonstrated at Finsbury Technical College. The use of Paul's Theatrograph in music halls up and down the country popularised early [[Film|cinema]] in Britain. It was first revealed to the public at the Egyptian Hall in [[Picadilly]], [[London]].

[[Carl Hertz]] sailed from England on 28 March 1896 aboard the [[Royal Mail Ship]] {{RMS|Norman}} and during the voyage exhibited Paul's Theatrograph to the passengers. He also exhibited films in [[South Africa]] and [[Australia]]. The screenings in South Africa were the first public screenings of moving pictures in that country. After Australia, Hertz took the Theatrograph to Ceylon ([[Sri Lanka]]), [[India]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Fiji|the Fiji Islands]], and [[Hawaii]].

[[George Melies]] purchased one of Paul's theatrographs in 1896.&lt;ref name=Wakeman2&gt;Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 1. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1987. pp. 747-765.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Theatrograph was also known as the Animatograph.

[[File:Tightrope walking.jpg|thumb|250px|The feet of a tightrope walker]]
'''Tightrope walking''', also called '''funambulism''', is the skill of walking along a thin [[wire]] or [[rope]]. It has a long tradition in various countries and is commonly associated with the [[circus]]. Other skills similar to tightrope walking include [[slackwire|slack rope walking]] and [[slacklining]].

==Types of rope and wire walking==
*'''Tightwire''' is the skill of maintaining balance while walking along a tensioned wire between two points. It can be done either using a balancing tool (umbrella, fan, balance pole, etc.) or "freehand", using only one's body to maintain balance. Typically, tightwire performances either include [[dance]] or [[object manipulation]]. Object manipulation acts include a variety of props in their acts, such as [[juggling club|clubs]] or rings, hats or canes. Tightwire performers have even used wheelbarrows with passengers, ladders, and animals in their act. The technique to maintain balance is to keep the performer's centre of mass above their support point—usually their feet.
**'''Highwire''' is a form of tight wire walking but performed at much greater height. Although there is no official height when tight wire becomes high wire, generally a wire over {{Convert|20|ft|4 = 0}} high will be regarded as a high wire act.
***'''Skywalk''' is a form of highwire which is performed at great heights and length. A skywalk is performed outdoors between tall building, gorges, across waterfalls or other natural and man-made structures.
[[File:Tightrope walking, Armenian manuscript.jpg|thumb|Tightrope walking, Armenian manuscript, 1688]]

==Biomechanics==
Acrobats maintain their [[balance (ability)|balance]] by positioning their [[centre of mass]] directly over their base of support, i.e. shifting most of their weight over their legs, arms or whatever part of their body they are using to hold them up. When they are on the ground with their feet side by side, the base of support is wide in the lateral direction but narrow in the [[sagittal]] (back-to-front) direction. In the case of highwire-walkers, their feet are parallel with each other, one foot positioned in front of the other while on the wire. Therefore, a tightwire walker's sway is side to side, their lateral support having been drastically reduced.  In both cases, whether side by side or parallel, the ankle is the pivot point.

A wire-walker may use a pole for balance or may stretch out his arms perpendicular to his trunk in the manner of a pole. This technique provides several advantages. It distributes mass away from the pivot point, thereby increasing the [[moment of inertia]]. This reduces [[angular acceleration]], so a greater [[torque]] is required to rotate the performer over the wire. The result is less tipping. In addition the performer can also correct sway by rotating the pole. This will create an equal and opposite torque on the body.

Tightwire-walkers typically perform in very thin and flexible, leather-soled slippers with a full length suede or leather sole to protect the feet from abrasions and bruises while still allowing the foot to curve around the wire. Though very infrequent in performance, amateur, hobbyist, or inexperienced funambulists will often walk barefoot so that the wire can be grasped between the big and second toe. This is more often done when using a rope, as the softer and silkier fibres are less taxing on the bare foot than the harder and more abrasive braided wire.

==Metaphorical use==
The word ''funambulism'' or the phrase ''"walking a tightrope"'' is also used in a metaphorical setting not referring to any actual acrobatic acts. For instance, politicians are said to "walk a tightrope" when trying to balance two opposing views with little room for compromise. The term can also be used in satirical or acidic contexts. [[Nicholas Taleb]] uses the phrase in his book ''[[The Black Swan (2007 book)|The Black Swan]]''. "You get respect for doing funambulism or spectator sports". Taleb is criticising scientists who prefer popularism to vigorous research and those who walk a fixed and narrow path rather than explore a large field of empirical study.&lt;ref&gt;Taleb, Nicholas. Black Swan. 2010 UK. p.368&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''title role''' in the [[performing arts]] is the performance part that gives the [[title (publishing)|title]] to the piece, as in ''[[Aida]]'', ''[[Giselle]]'', ''[[Michael Collins (film)|Michael Collins]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Irish English as Represented in Film|page=258|first=Shane|last=Walshe|publisher=Peter Lang|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Othello]]''. The [[actor]], [[singer]], or [[dancer]] who performs that part is also said to have the ''title role''.

The performer playing the title role is not always the [[leading actor|lead]] and the title role may or may not be the [[protagonist]]. In the [[television]] [[miniseries]] ''[[Shogun (miniseries)|Shogun]]'', for example, [[Toshirō Mifune]] had the title role, but the lead was played by [[Richard Chamberlain]]. In the [[James Bond]] novel ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'', the title character is the primary antagonist. The title role and the lead can be different genders; for example, in the 2003 revival of [[August Wilson]]'s ''[[Ma Rainey's Black Bottom]]'', [[Whoopi Goldberg]] had the title role, but the lead was [[Charles S. Dutton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The A to Z of African American Theater|first=Anthony D|last=Hill|date=September 2, 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=xxxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title character==
The '''title character''' in narrative works is one who is named or referred to in the title, such as [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] in the TV series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] in the namesake [[Harry Potter|series of novels]] and [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hermione Granger Saves the World: Essays on the Feminist Heroine of Hogwarts|publisher=McFarland|date=July 30, 2012|last=Bell|first=Christoper E|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' in the [[Shakespeare]] play&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.richmondshakespearefestival.org/event/the-tragedy-of-romeo-and-juliet/|title=The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet|publisher=Richmond Shakespeare Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Annie Oakley]] in the musical ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great White Way: Race and the Broadway Musical|publisher=Rutgers University Press|date=February 18, 2014|first=Warren|last=Hoffman|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''title character'' need not be fictional, such as [[Erin Brockovich]] in the [[Erin Brockovich (film)|film of the same name]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Myths, Stereotypes, and Controlling Images in Film: A Feminist Content Analysis of Hollywood's Portrayal of Women's Career Choices.|isbn=9781243451705|page=58|first=Tonya R|last=Hammer|date=April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Thomas More]] in the play ''[[A Man for All Seasons]]'' by [[Robert Bolt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Best Test Preparation for the Advanced Placement Examination in English Literature &amp; Composition|publisher=Research and Education Assocn.|date=1990|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title character need not be named in the title, but may be referred to by some other word or phrase, such as [[Bilbo Baggins]] in ''[[The Hobbit]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hobbit/canalysis.html|title=The Hobbit, J. R. R. Tolkien, Analysis of major characters|publisher=SparkNotes}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Idi Amin]] in ''[[The Last King of Scotland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=Contemporary Aesthetics|title=The Last King of Scotland, the Last N----r on Earth? The Ethics of Race on Film|first=Paul C|last=Taylor|date=July 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A title character may only be indirectly ''described'' in the title, as in ''[[An Ideal Husband]]'' by [[Oscar Wilde]], where the 'ideal husband' (the title role) is the apparently perfect Sir Robert Chiltern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/boston/article/Review-An-Ideal-Husband-at-The-Gamm-20081113|title=Review: An Ideal Husband at The Gamm|date=November 14, 2008|last=Rice|first=Randy|publisher=Wisdom Digital Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title character need not be the subject of the whole title in a strict grammatical sense: Uncle Tom is the title character of ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ready Reference Treatise: Uncle Tom’s Cabin|first=Raja|last=Sharma|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lee Marvin]] is often described as playing the title character in the film ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'', as his character (Liberty Valance) is named in the title, even though the subject of the title is the person who shot him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gangster Priest: The Italian American Cinema of Martin Scorsese|first=Robert|last=Casillo|date=2006|ISBN=9780802091130|page=153|publisher=University of Toronto Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A title character may be the main antagonist, e.g. [[Sauron]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Where the Shadows Lie: A Jungian Interpretation of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings|first=Pia|last=Skogemann|publisher=Chiron Publications|date=2009|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Cinema through Global Genres|first=William V|last=Constanzo|publisher=John Wiley &amp; sons|date=November 18, 2013|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', the wizard is the title character, but [[Dorothy Gale]] is the main character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/the-wonderful-wizard-of-oz-by-l-frank-baum-summary-characters.html#lesson|publisher=Education Portal|title=The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum: Summary &amp; Characters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the video game ''[[The Legend of Zelda (series)|The Legend of Zelda]]'', the title character, [[Princess Zelda]], is the [[damsel in distress]], but the protagonist is [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/games/zelda/21232/the-legend-of-zelda-why-link-is-one-of-the-most-enduring-characters-in-videogaming|title=The Legend Of Zelda: why Link is one of the most enduring characters in videogaming|date=23 November 2011|first=Ryan|last=Lambie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title character may be [[unseen character|unseen]], e.g. Godot in ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ready Reference Treatise: Waiting for Godot|last=Sharma|first=Raja|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebecca de Winter in the 1938 novel ''[[Rebecca (novel)|Rebecca]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/daphne-du-maurier-and-the-gothic-tradition |title=Daphne du Maurier and the Gothic Tradition |last=Buzwell |first=Greg |date=25 May 2016 |website=[[British Library]] |access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Jason Bourne]] in the 2012 film ''[[The Bourne Legacy (film)|The Bourne Legacy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/09/the-bourne-legacy-review|publisher=The Guardian|title=The Bourne Legacy – review|date=August 9, 2012|first=Peter|last=Bradshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Title character has been attributed to objects, for example the bus in the film and musical ''[[Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/02-2013/priscilla-queen-of-the-desert-tour-oxford_1040.html|title=Priscilla - Queen of the Desert (Tour - Oxford)|first=Simon|last=Tavener|date=February 28, 2013|publisher=What's on Stage: Theatre News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titular===
The general phrase "title character" can be replaced with a description of the character, which is then "titular". For example, the title character of ''Dracula'' can be referred to as "the titular vampire",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Blood Will Tell: Blood and Vampires as Metaphors in the Political and Popular Cultures of Great Britain, France, Germany, and the United States, 1870--1914|page=131|first=Sara Libby|last=Robinson|publisher=Proquest|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the title character of ''Hamlet'' is "the titular prince of Denmark".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Theatre: History, Context, Form|first=Theresa|last=Saxon|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
