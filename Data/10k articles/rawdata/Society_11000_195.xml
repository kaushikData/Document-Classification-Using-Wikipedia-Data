[[File:Looking for a tactical vehicle 1033.png|thumb|right|Slide from the [[Defense Logistics Agency]]'s brochure, describing the '''1033 Program''''s transfer of military equipment to American police forces.]]

In the [[United States]], the '''1033 Program''' transfers excess [[military equipment]] to [[civilian]] [[law enforcement agencies]]. The program legally requires the Department of Defense to make various items of equipment available to local law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dla.mil/AboutDLA/News/NewsArticleView/Article/998344/shedding-light/|title=Shedding Light|work=Defense Logistics Agency|access-date=2018-02-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2014}}, 8,000 local law enforcement agencies participated in the program that has transferred $5.1 billion in military material from the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to [[law enforcement in the United States|law enforcement agencies]] since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Poynton |first1=Aaron |title=Military &amp; Civilian Resources: Doing More With Less |url=http://www.domesticpreparedness.com/pub/docs/DPJSeptember14.pdf |website=Domestic Preparedness |publisher=Domestic Preparedness Journal |accessdate=4 February 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XKhUGKS2?url=http://www.domesticpreparedness.com/pub/docs/DPJSeptember14.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Defense Logistics Agency]], material worth $449 million was transferred in 2013 alone.   Some of the most commonly requested items include ammunition, cold weather clothing, sand bags, medical supplies,  sleeping bags, flashlights and electrical wiring. Small arms and vehicles such as aircraft, watercraft and armored vehicles have also been obtained.

The program has been criticized over the years by local media, by the [[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense]] in 2003, and by the [[GAO]] which found waste, fraud and abuse. It was not until media coverage of  police during August [[2014 Ferguson unrest]] that the program drew nationwide public attention; the Ferguson Police Department had equipment obtained through the 1033 program.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/08/13/ferguson-police-michael-brown-militarization-column/14006383/&lt;/ref&gt;

President Obama signed Executive Order 13688 on May 2015 limiting and prohibiting certain types of equipment.&lt;ref name="Obama bans"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Korte|first1=Gregory|title=Obama bans some military equipment sales to police|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/05/18/obama-police-military-equipment-sales-new-jersey/27521793/|accessdate=28 August 2017|work=USA Today|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Recommendations re: EO 13688"&gt;{{cite web|title=Recommendations Pursuant to Executive Order 13688|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/le_equipment_wg_final_report_final.pdf|website=Obama White House Archives|publisher=White House|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 August 2017 President Trump rolled back Obama's Executive Order.&lt;ref name="Trump lifts ban"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Kevin|title=Trump expected to lift ban on military gear to local police forces|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/08/27/trump-expected-lift-ban-military-gear-local-police-forces/606065001/|accessdate=28 August 2017|work=USA Today|date=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ACLU]] and the [[NAACP]] have raised concerns about they call the [[militarization of police]] forces in the US. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the move early Monday morning of that week at the Fraternal Order of Police convention in Nashville, and said the president would do so by executive order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2017/08/27/trump-restores-program-sending-surplus-military-weapons-equipment-to-police/|title=Trump to restore program sending surplus military weapons, equipment to police|last=Jackman|first=Tom|date=2017-08-27|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Jeff Sessions]] and the director of the [[Fraternal Order of Police]] (FOP) pointed out the use of 1033 equipment as life saving devices seeing restrictions on distributing military surplus to police as “too far." The FOP also pointed out that the armored vehicles weren't tanks.&lt;ref name="Trump lifts ban" /&gt;

==History==

===Predecessor, 1943–1949===
In 1944, the [[Surplus Property Act]] provided for the disposal of surplus government property, and spawned numerous short lived agencies like the Surplus War Property Administration (SWPA), in the Office of War Mobilization (OWM, February–October 1944), the Surplus Property Board (SPB), in the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion (OWMR, October 1944 – September 1945), the Surplus Property Administration and also corporations like the Petroleum Reserves Corporation (PRC) and the War Assets Corporation to deal with it. The [[War Assets Administration]] was the latest to operate and was abolished in 1949.

===1990–2014===
The "National Defense Authorization Act of 1990", section 1208 authorized transfer of [[military hardware]] from the Department of Defense broadly to "federal and state agencies", but specifically "for use in counter-drug activities".&lt;ref name=LESO&gt;{{cite web|author1=Law Enforcement Support Office (LESO)|title=1033 Program FAQ|url=http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Pages/1033ProgramFAQs.aspx#q1|publisher=DLA Disposition Services|accessdate=27 November 2014|date=n.d.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202031945/http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/pages/1033programfaqs.aspx#q1#q1|archive-date=2 December 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wofford&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wofford|first1=Taylor|title=How America's Police Became an Army: The 1033 Program|url=http://www.newsweek.com/how-americas-police-became-army-1033-program-264537|accessdate=16 August 2014|agency=Newsweek|date=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as this legislation was passed in the context of the [[War on Drugs]].&lt;ref name=wofford /&gt;&lt;ref name=dw&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Richard|title=US police go military with 1033 program|url=http://www.dw.de/us-police-go-military-with-1033-program/a-17857709|accessdate=18 August 2014|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1997, it was called the '''1208 program''' and run by the Department of Defense from the Pentagon and its regional offices.&lt;ref name=1033brochure&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1033 Program|url=http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Documents/LESO%20Forms/1033%20Program.pptx|publisher=US Government Defense Logistics Agency|date=n.d.|accessdate=16 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141130143525/http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Documents/LESO%20Forms/1033%20Program.pptx#|archive-date=30 November 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the "Law Enforcement Support Office" was created within the DLA to work exclusively with law enforcement.&lt;ref name=1033brochure /&gt;

With passage of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, the 1208 program was expanded to the 1033 program allowing "all law enforcement agencies to acquire property for bona fide law enforcement purposes that assist in their arrest and apprehension mission", and that "Preference is given to counter-drug and counter-terrorism requests".&lt;ref name=LESO/&gt; It was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on 23 September 1996.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/104/hr3230&lt;/ref&gt;

In October the [[DLA Disposition Services]] first released information about the equipment distribution by county. An inflection point occurred in the fall 2014 after several events brought increasing public scrutiny, and the eventual release of Federal records on the movement of military goods to civilian police forces was made public on November 21, 2014. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2014/12/03/the-pentagon-finally-details-its-weapons-for-cops-giveaway|title=The Pentagon Finally Details its Weapons-for-Cops Giveaway|date=2014-12-03|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=federalist20141219&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bottum|first1=Joseph |title=National Security: Even Small Towns Are Loading Up On Grenade Launchers |url=http://thefederalist.com/2014/12/19/even-small-towns-are-loading-up-on-grenade-launchers/ |accessdate=21 December 2014 |work=The Federalist |date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The [[DLA Disposition Services|U.S. Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services]] (DLA) help the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to dispose of its "excess property [...] from air conditioners to vehicles, clothing to computers" by "transfer to other federal agencies, or donation to state and local governments and other qualified organizations", as well as by "sale of surplus property".&lt;ref name="DLADSabout us"&gt;{{cite web|author1=DLA Disposition Services Public Affairs|title=About Us|url=http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/Pages/About_Disposition_Services.aspx|publisher=DLA Disposition Services|accessdate=27 November 2014|date=n.d.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141118163512/http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/Pages/About_Disposition_Services.aspx#|archive-date=18 November 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Availability of surplus equipment has been facilitated by the  [[U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement|reduced American presence in Iraq]] and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=dw /&gt; The 1033 program is designed to specifically work with [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]], like local police forces, school district police and others.

===Material donated===
From  1997 until 2014, $5.1 billion in military hardware were transferred from the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to local American [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]], according to DLA's "Law Enforcement Support Office" (LESO) and material worth $449 million was transferred in 2013 alone.&lt;ref name=LESO /&gt;&lt;ref name=ingraham&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ingraham|first1=Christopher|title=The Pentagon gave nearly half a billion dollars of military gear to local law enforcement last year|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/08/14/the-pentagon-gave-nearly-half-a-billion-dollars-of-military-gear-to-local-law-enforcement-last-year/|date=14 August 2014|accessdate=16 August 2014|work=Wonkblog|publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; About a third of the equipment is new.&lt;ref name=dansky&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/19/opinion/dansky-militarization-police/?hpt=ob_articlefooter&amp;iref=obinsite |author=Kara Dansky| title=Emotions run high in Ferguson, Missouri |work=CNN Opinion|publisher=Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.| date=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly obtained item from the 1033 program is ammunition.

The DLA also offers tactical armored vehicles, weapons, including grenade launchers, watercraft, and aircraft.&lt;ref name=1033brochure /&gt;&lt;ref name=ppt&gt;{{cite web|author1=DLA Disposition Services|title=1033 Program Overview|url=http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Documents/LESO%20Forms/1033%20Program.pptx|publisher=LESO|accessdate=27 November 2014|pages=69|format=powerpoint presentation|date=22 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141130143525/http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Documents/LESO%20Forms/1033%20Program.pptx#|archive-date=30 November 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police departments===
{{As of|2014}}, 8,000 local law enforcement agencies participate in the reutilization program.&lt;ref name=LESO /&gt; Police departments are responsible for paying for shipment and storage of material acquired, but do not pay for the donation. The largest number of requests for material comes from small to mid-sized police departments who are unable to afford extra clothing, vehicles and weapons. The program gives smaller police departments access to material that larger police departments are usually able to afford without federal assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Firozi|first1=Paulina|title=Police forces pick up surplus military supplies|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/06/15/local-law-enforcement-agencies-surplus-military-equipment/10286485/|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[memorandum of agreement]] between the DLA and the states participating in 1033 requires that local police forces either utilize the military equipment within one year or return it.&lt;ref name=dw /&gt; The rules allow police to dispose of or sell some goods after at least one year of usage.&lt;ref name=az/&gt;

===School districts===
{{As of| September 2014}} more than twenty [[school district]] police agencies received military-grade equipment through the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/school-districts-1033-program-military-equipment|title = Report: School Districts Are Receiving Free Military Gear From The Pentagon|publisher = Talking Points Memo|accessdate=15 September 2014|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[San Diego school district]] planned to return a military surplus vehicle after negative public reaction.&lt;ref name=KPBS&gt;{{cite news|author1=Associated Press|title=San Diego School Police To Return 18-Ton Military Vehicle|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2014/sep/18/san-diego-school-police-return-18-ton-military-veh/|accessdate=28 November 2014|work=KPBS|publisher=KPBS Public Broadcasting|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Los Angeles School Police Department]] has also received excess military equipment, including 61 assault rifles, three grenade launchers, and an [[MRAP]] vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pamer|first1=Melissa|last2=Romero|first2=Lynette|title=LAUSD Police Arsenal Includes Armored Vehicle, Grenade Launchers, Chief Confirms|url=http://ktla.com/2014/09/15/lausd-police-arsenal-includes-armored-vehicle-grenade-launchers-chief-confirms/|accessdate=2 December 2017|publisher=KTLA 5|date=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten School Police Departments in Texas also participate in the 1033 program, in total acquiring 25 [[automatic pistols]], 64 [[M16 rifles|M16 assault rifles]], 18 [[M14 rifle|M14 assault rifle]]s, 15 vehicles  and [[Improved Outer Tactical Vest|tactical vests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Noll|first1=Scott|title=Military Rifles, Armor Sent to Texas School Police|url=http://www.khou.com/news/investigations/military-rifles-armor-sent-to-texas-school-police/259166309|accessdate=2 December 2017|publisher=KHOU 11|date=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, at least 117 colleges and universities in the United States have used the 1033 program to acquire military-grade equipment through their campus police departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/On-Campus-Grenade-Launchers/148749|title=On Campus, Grenade Launchers, M-16s, and Armored Vehicles|date=2014-09-11|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher education institutions that participate in the program include local community colleges, state universities, and Ivy Leagues, ranging from [[Hinds Community College]], [[University of Central Florida]], [[University of California]], [[Columbia University]], and [[Yale University|Yale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ppm9zv/the-pentagon-is-giving-grenade-launchers-to-campus-police-904|title=The Pentagon Is Giving Grenade Launchers to Campus Police|date=2014-09-05|work=Vice|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]] attempted to use the federal program to acquire an Armored Response Counter Attack Truck, also referred to as a [[Lenco BearCat]], to deal with possible campus shootings, but public outcry forced UC Berkeley Chancellor [[Robert J. Birgeneau|Robert Birgenau]] to reverse procurement of the eight-ton armored truck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/06/university-of-california-armored-truck_n_1654032.html|title=University Of California, Berkeley Campus Police Will Not Be Allowed To Buy Armored Truck|last=Kingkade|first=Tyler|date=2012-07-06|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Ohio State University acquired an [[MRAP]] (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected) vehicle that was equipped with a machine gun turret, becoming the first campus in the U.S. to integrate this kind of military-grade equipment into their campus police department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/18/ohio-state-university-armored-truck_n_3949750.html|title=Ohio State University Acquires Military-Style Armored Truck (PHOTO)|last=Stuart|first=Hunter|date=2013-09-18|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florida State University]] used the program to acquire a [[Humvee]], which campus police say is only to be used in the case of an active shooter, not a civil disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grasgreen|first1=Allie|title=Military Hardware for College Cops|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/defense-surplus-university-police-110323|accessdate=2 December 2017|date=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Central Washington University]] has also received an armored truck through the program, claiming the truck is used to train for active-shooter scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/15/campus-police-weapons_n_5823310.html|title=Campus Police Are Stocking Up On Military-Grade Weapons|last=Kingkade|first=Tyler|date=2014-09-15|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-12-06|last2=Svokos|first2=Alexandra|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular military equipment acquired by colleges and universities through the 1033 program is the [[M16 rifle|M16]]. Campus police at the [[Arizona State University]] currently hold the most M16’s with a total of 70, followed by [[Florida International University]] and the [[University of Maryland]], which both carry 50 M16’s. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bauman|first1=Dan|title=Campus Police Acquire Military Weapons|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/world/americas/campus-police-acquire-military-weapons.html|accessdate=2 December 2017|publisher=The New York Times|date=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participating campus departments pay only for delivery and maintenance of allocated military supplies, paying a mere $507.43 for as many as 12 M-16 rifles ([[University of Louisiana at Monroe]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If colleges and universities seek to acquire material not obtainable directly through the 1033 program, like other local law enforcement agencies, they may purchase said equipment through federal grants allocated by the [[Department of Defense (US)|DOD]]. Another justification for involvement in the 1033 program is the epidemic of school shootings on U.S. campuses, with many college and university representatives citing the [[Virginia Tech shooting]] as reason for concern and increased militarization of campus police departments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In instances where campus police departments fail to or do not directly attempt to acquire excess military material from the 1033 program, partnership with local and regional law enforcement through [[Mutual aid (emergency services)|mutual aid]] allows colleges and universities to indirectly benefit from the program by utilizing military equipment obtained by law enforcement agencies in the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/06/university-of-california-armored-truck_n_1654032.html|title=University Of California, Berkeley Campus Police Will Not Be Allowed To Buy Armored Truck|last=Kingkade|first=Tyler|date=2012-07-06|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where police jurisdiction overlaps between college and universities and the municipal area they inhabit, the acquisition of material such as an [[MRAP]] by a municipal law enforcement agency can substitute acquisition by a campus police department, as was the case between the city of [[Davis, California|Davis]], CA and the [[University of California, Davis|University of California at Davis]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/crime/article2607226.html|title=Davis acquires mine-resistant war vehicle while some complain of militarization of police|date=2014-08-20|work=The Sacramento Bee|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US|issn=0890-5738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oversight===
Law enforcement agencies must declare the intended use for each item, maintain an audit trail for each item and conduct inventory checks for DLA.

In 2005, the [[Government Accountability Office]] found that the Pentagon "does not have management controls in place" to avert waste, abuse and fraud in the program. Investigators identified "hundreds of millions of dollars in reported lost, damaged, or stolen excess property ... which contributed to reutilization program waste and inefficiency."&lt;ref name=az/&gt;

== Political responses ==

In August 2014, the militarized response to [[2014 Ferguson unrest|civil unrest in Ferguson]], Missouri led to increased criticism of the 1033 program:
*U.S. senator [[Rand Paul]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], stated that the American government "has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts and helped municipal governments build what are essentially small armies."&lt;ref name=dw /&gt;&lt;ref name=RandP&gt;{{cite news|author1=Rand Paul|title=Rand Paul: We Must Demilitarize the Police|url=http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/|accessdate=27 November 2014|work=Time Magazine|publisher=Time Warner|date=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Congressman [[Hank Johnson]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], drafted legislation proposing to curb, but not end the 1033 program, urged legislative armed services committee to suspend the transfer of some equipment.&lt;ref name=hill&gt;{{cite news|author1=Mario Trujillo and Jesse Byrnes|title=Lawmaker drafting bill to demilitarize local police   108|url=http://thehill.com/policy/defense/215160-lawmaker-drafting-bill-to-stem-flow-of-tanks-and-m16s-to-police|accessdate=27 November 2014|work=The Hill|publisher=Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.|date=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*President Obama ordered a review of the program.&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{cite news|author1=Steve Holland|author2=Andrea Shalal|title=Obama orders review of police use of military hardware|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/24/us-usa-missouri-shooting-militarization-idUSKBN0GN0O920140824|accessdate=24 August 2014|work=Reuters.com|date=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, [[Senator Claire McCaskill]] organized the Senate's first hearing on the program, and federal officials faced bipartisan criticism:
*Brian Kamoie, assistant administrator for grant programs at the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]], stated that officials are conducting a review to determine if police forces deployed in Ferguson improperly used equipment purchased with the grants for riot suppression, which is not allowed. It was inconclusive from the questioning, how many times equipment was purchased with funds used to combat terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Steven|title=Pentagon Rethinks Giving MRAPs, Bayonets to Police|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/09/09/pentagon-will-rethink-giving-mraps-bayonets-to-police-official-says|website=US News|publisher=US News|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rear Admiral John Kirby, press secretary for the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]], argued that the program has aided law enforcement across the US in counter-terrorism and counter-narcotic operation, and to protect civilians. He stated that the Pentagon was diligent in deciding what equipment was sent to specific police departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lamothe|first1=Dan|title=Pentagon defends program supplying military gear to Ferguson police|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2014/08/19/pentagon-defends-program-supplying-military-gear-to-ferguson-police/|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Chuck Canterbury, president of the [[Fraternal Order of Police]], argued that [[mass shooting]]s could occur anywhere in the United States, even in small towns, and that the equipment obtained from the 1033 program is being used to protect civilians and law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bruce|first1=Becky|title=Fraternal Order of Police defends 'militarization'|url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=370&amp;sid=31391932|publisher=KSL Radio|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Congressman [[Buck McKeon]] scheduled a [[United States House Committee on Armed Services]] subcommittee "Oversight and Investigations" hearing to examine the program, which was postponed.&lt;ref name=lillis/&gt;
*The [[House Judiciary Committee]] declined to review the program, stating that any review would follow an investigation by the Obama administration.&lt;ref name=lillis&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lillis|first1=Mike|title=Push to demilitarize cops in lame duck|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/222520-new-push-to-demilitarize-cops-in-lame-duck|accessdate=26 November 2014|agency=The Hill|date=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014,
*Congressman [[Hank Johnson]] urged the heads of the Armed Services Committees to adopt a moratorium on the transfer of certain items and to eliminate a section of the House version of the 2015 Defense bill, passed earlier in 2014, that would expand equipment transfers to [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|border security]], the nation's largest law enforcement agency.&lt;ref name=lillis/&gt;
 
In November 2014,
*Rand Paul's second Ferguson op-ed in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' did not mention the demilitarization of the police, which had been subject of his first op-ed, .&lt;ref name=bloom&gt;{{cite news|author1=David Weigel|title=How Police Unions Stopped Congress From 'Militarization' Reform|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-11-25/how-police-unions-stopped-congress-from-militarization-reform|accessdate=27 November 2014|work=Bloomberg News|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Steve Rabinovich, a police officer writing for police website ''PoliceOne.com'', defended the 1033 program as necessary for protecting police officers from violent or deadly assaults by individuals or anti-government groups viewing police as scapegoats.&lt;ref name=policeone&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rabinovich|first1=Steve|title=Answering the critics of MRAPs and the 1033 Program|url=http://www.policeone.com/chiefs-sheriffs/articles/7774911-Answering-the-critics-of-MRAPs-and-the-1033-Program/|work=policeone.com|publisher=Praetorian Group, Inc|accessdate=26 November 2014|date=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buck McKeon]] (R-Calif.) and [[Adam Smith (politician)|Adam Smith]] (D-Wash.) are working on a compromise of the [[Howard P. "Buck" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (H.R. 4435; 113th Congress)|2015 defense authorization bill]], instead of a moratorium.&lt;ref name=lillis/&gt;

*The [[White House]] had not released results of its review, promised in September, when [[National Guard of the United States]] was deployed to Ferguson and further unrest occurred after the grand jury decision in Ferguson. Police lobbying efforts, and the [[United States elections, 2014|elections]] had rendered Congress [[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]], and the support for ending or changing the 1033 program dwindled.&lt;ref name=mmsantoro /&gt;

In May 2015, following the [[2015 Baltimore protests]], Obama announced reviews of the use of military equipment, stating "We've seen how militarized gear sometimes gives people a feeling like they are an occupying force as opposed to a part of the community there to protect them," and "Some equipment made for the battlefield is not appropriate for local police departments."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/05/18/obama-to-visit-camden-n-j-to-tout-community-policing-reforms/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/18/us-usa-race-obama-idUSKBN0O30UQ20150518&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other criticism===
Kara Dansky, senior counsel for the [[ACLU]], wrote that the federal government is deliberately militarizing local law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref name=dansky/&gt;

According to a study by [[social scientist]] Dr. Casey Delehanty and colleagues, larger 1033 transfers are associated with increased killings by police.&lt;ref name="veconomist" &gt;{{cite news|author=C.K.|title=The rhetorical power of "support our troops"|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2017/10/patriotism-and-protest|work=[[The Economist]]|date=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police department suspensions==
DLA public-affairs chief Kenneth MacNevin stated in 2012, that "more than 30 Arizona police agencies have been suspended or terminated for failing to meet program standards and nine remain under suspension".&lt;ref name=az/&gt;  One of them was the [[Maricopa County, Arizona]] law enforcement after failing to account for 20 of the 200 military weapons it had received.&lt;ref name=cassidy&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cassidy|first1=Megan|title=MCSO missing nine weapons from Pentagon's 1033 program|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2014/08/26/mcso-weapons-pentagon-suspension-1033/14659089/|accessdate=29 August 2014|agency=AZ Central|date=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suspension did not affect police acquisition of high powered weaponry due to anti-racketeering or confiscated drug funds, according to Maricopa's Sheriff.&lt;ref name=cassidy /&gt;

In North Carolina, law officials are working to reinstate the 1033 program through more rigorous inventory management, after the state was suspended for failing to account for some transferred equipment.&lt;ref name=ramey&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramey|first1=Elisse|title=1033 Program in Eastern North Carolina|url=http://www.witn.com/home/headlines/The-Military-Excess-Property-Program-in-Eastern-North-Carolina.html?ref=761|accessdate=26 November 2014|agency=WITN|date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Carolina officials state that 3,303 out of the 4,227 pieces of equipment obtained through the program are tactical items including automatic weapons and military vehicles and the remainder is not used in combat, and includes cots, containers and generators.&lt;ref name=ramey /&gt;

Fusion reported in August 2014 that a total of 184 state and local police departments had been suspended from the program for missing weapons and failure to comply with guidelines.&lt;ref name=fusion&gt;{{cite web| url=http://fusion.net/leadership/story/americas-police-departments-lose-loads-military-issued-weapons-984250| author=Daniel Rivero, Jorge Rivas |title= Fusion Investigates: How did America's police departments lose loads of military-issued weapons?| publisher=Fusion |date=26 August 2014| accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Missing items included M14 and [[M16 rifle|M16 assault rifle]]s, pistols, shotguns, and two [[Humvee]] vehicles.&lt;ref name=fusion/&gt;

Investigative journalist Susan Katz Keating reported in October 2017 that certain elements of the program were restored despite the compliance issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2017/10/05/pentagon_to_police_here_are_your_weapons_please_dont_lose_them_again.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Youth rights sidebar}}

'''Americans for a Society Free from Age Restrictions''', also known as '''ASFAR Youth Liberation''', is an organization dedicated to increasing the rights of youth under [[American law]]. The purpose of ASFAR is to "defend and advance the [[Civil rights|civil]] and [[human rights]] of [[adolescents|young people]] through promoting the elimination and reform of laws that limit the [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] and [[self-determination]] of young people in the United States, and [[Youth empowerment|empowering young people to act]] on their own behalf in defense of their rights and freedoms".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100106011404/http://www.asfar.org/Articles_of_Incorporation ASFAR Articles of Incorporation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ASFAR is associated with the [[youth rights movement]], which advocates more freedom for young people and protection of their rights under law, in order to allow them the greatest degree of self-determination possible.

== History and schism ==
{{Section OR|date=October 2007}}
ASFAR, originally an email list organization, was founded in 1996 by Matt Walcoff and Matt Herman, two individuals who felt that age restrictions in the U.S. had gone too far. The small project grew into what could be called a legitimate organization. In 1999, ASFAR was [[Corporation|incorporated]] in Missouri.

Within a year of its founding, ASFAR developed internal conflicts that would ultimately split the organization. Disputes over [[Corporate governance|internal affairs]] and over the Declaration of Principles would lead to the creation of two factions. One group, which included the majority of the membership at that time, called for a detailed and radical [[Political platform|declaration of principles]] and a high degree of membership involvement in the formation of policy. This faction took the name of the group literally and insisted the organization oppose all age restrictions as a matter of principle.

The other faction, led by Herman and Walcoff, called for a more traditional organization, led by a [[board of directors]] and with a smaller, more pragmatic set of policy positions. This latter group would leave to form the more visible and active [[National Youth Rights Association]] (NYRA).&lt;ref name="youthrights.net"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120219160636/http://www.youthrights.net/index.php?title=ASFAR-NYRA_Schism Schism - Youth Rights Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present status ==
ASFAR opposes a wide variety of laws that limit the freedom of young people, such as [[voting age]] limits, [[curfew]] laws, compulsory education, [[child labor laws]],  [[age of consent]] laws, [[Legal drinking age|minimum drinking ages]], [[pornography]] age laws, [[child prostitution]] laws and minimum ages for [[Firearms license|firearm possession]]. They support a non-age-based alternative to every age-based law, and believe that the rights of all people to freedom and self-determination outweigh the cost of implementing non-age-based laws.

The animosity that led to the schism with NYRA has largely subsided, and ASFAR enjoys amicable and cordial relations with NYRA. While neither organization has gone on record as supporting formal reunification, neither organization has formally renounced the prospect.&lt;ref name="youthrights.net"/&gt;

ASFAR published an internet [[zine]], ''Youth Truth'', that was nominated for the [[Utne Reader|Utne]] [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] Award for "General Excellence -- [[Zine]]" in 2006. ''Youth Truth'' was suspended in 2007 by order of its board of directors. In the January 2010 board meeting, the board of directors appointed Susan Wishnetsky to restart the zine. Meanwhile, ASFAR's opposition to the [[age of consent]] continues to attract members to ASFAR, as NYRA objects to taking a position on the issue.&lt;ref name="ASFAR Work Plan"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20120310151524/http://www.youthrights.org/docs/NYRAChapterHandbook.pdf NYRA chapter handbook; see note in right-hand column of page 4&lt;/ref&gt; ASFAR is currently in the process of forming new positions on the age of consent, students' rights, the drinking age, and the treatment of young people by the media.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32233">[[Image:Bolos asturianos.JPG|250px|thumb|right|A variety of dirt bowls in [[Asturias]], North of Spain]]
'''Basque bowls''' ({{lang-eu|bola jokoa}}), is one of the few [[Basque rural sports]] which do not originate in an activity related to rural or marine work. It has a number of other names too and is played in a  ''bolatoki'' or ''bolaleku'' "[[bowls]] place" which often consists of a playing area in the open, an open sided structure with a low roof or a playing area located inside a [[colonnade]]d hallway.

The game has been more common in the southern parts of the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] in the last few centuries, especially in [[Álava]] and [[Biscay]] and to a lesser degree in [[Gipuzkoa]] and [[Navarre]] but documents from the [[Bayonne]] archives from the 17th-century mention the games{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and there is also other evidence to show that the game was also played historically in the [[Iparralde|northern part of the Basque Country]].

The main characteristic of the Basque variants of the game is the more prominent use of balls with finger-holes and hand-holes which distinguishes it from other regions in the area which prefer balls without.

==Basic terms==
*the game is variously called ''pirlak'', ''pirleak'', ''bolak'' and ''botxak'' (from [[boccia]]); ''-ak'' is a [[Basque language|Basque]] [[plural]] ending.
*the bowling ball is called ''bola''
*the pins are variously called ''bolo'', ''pirla'', ''pirle'', ''birla'', ''txirla'', ''esku'', ''zilla'', ''erdiko'' or ''guena''
*a player is called ''bolari''
*a playing area is called ''bolatoki''

==The game==
They are all variants of [[lawn bowls|dirt-track and lawn bowls]] and as such related to games such as [[bowls]], [[Skittles (sport)|skittles]] and [[bowling]]. There is a large number of different variations of the game (over 25 variants in [[Biscay]] and [[Álava]] alone), sometimes sharing their rules with varieties in other areas like [[Cantabria]], [[Burgos]] or [[León (province)|León]]. Some varieties are extremely localised and with specialised playing areas not found outside the area.
[[Image:Bolera de La Helguera - Barrio de Arriba.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A playing area for [[Cantabria]]n ''[[bolo palma]]'']]

The main points of variation center around points such as:
*how many pins there are and how they are arranged
*the shape of the ''bolatokia''

Due to societal changes, some variants are reduced to events at [[festival|fiesta]]s rather than everyday past-times. For example, of the over 400 playing areas that existed in Biscay in the last century, only some 100 remain. At the same time, organised competitions are also held these days among the provincial federations and clubs. Always keen to embrace new technologies, enthusiasts are also using the internet to attract new members and players.

==Particular variants==
Many varieties are known only by the geographical affiliation: ''Arabar boloa'' (Álavan bowls), ''Burgosko bola'' ([[Burgos]] bowls), ''Gesaltzako bola'' ([[Añana|Gesaltza]] bowls), ''Palentziako bola'' ([[Palencia]] bowls) and so on.

===Aiara bowls===
[[Image:Erremontea.png|60px|thumb|left|''Aiarako Erremontea'']]
Known as ''Aiarako bola jokoa'' and ''Aiararra'' in Basque, ''ayalés'' and ''remonte'' in Spanish. Two ''bolatoki'' in [[Ayala/Aiara|Aiara]] for this variant remain in popular use but other exist in an area between [[Gueñes]], [[Artziniega]], [[Tertanga]] and [[Ibarra (Guipúzcoa)|Ibarra]].

The sunken playing area, called ''carrejo'' or ''boladera'' is 20&amp;ndash;28&amp;nbsp;m long and 3.5&amp;ndash;4.20&amp;nbsp;m wide and surrounded by slanting sides, giving the playing area the appearance of a large, sunken trough. Originally played on clay, many use a wooden floor now. The launching area is up to 5m long and the nine large pins are arranged in a 3x3 square at the far end. There is also a small pin (called ''bolinchín'', ''cuatro'', ''txikerra'' or ''chiquito'') which is worth four points. The balls have finger and hand-holes, are 28–30&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and usually weigh between 8–14&amp;nbsp;kg but heavier ones have been used.

The player, using spin, launches the ball onto either the left or right long incline and to achieve a valid throw, has to knock over at least the small pin and one large pin. The ball the (ideally) rebounds from the back incline and knocks over more pins. Pins knocked over by other pins also count.

===Álavan bowls===
[[Image:Arabar boloa.png|95px|thumb|right|''Arabar boloa'']]
Called ''Arabar boloa'' or ''lautadakoa'' (the one from the ''lautada'') in Basque, ''juego de bolo alavés'' and ''bolo de la Llanada'' in Spanish.  The playing area consists of three main parts, all of which are a step down from the surrounding areas:

*the ''parra'' or ''pato'' which is a sunken wooden board delineating the edge of the area where the player may launch from
*the ''loma'' which is an 18–21&amp;nbsp;m long wooden plank, between 18–20&amp;nbsp;cm wide running between the walls of the sunken into the ground.
*the pin area, where the playing area widens again, with markers for the location of the pins.

The balls have no handles, weigh between 2.1-2.5&amp;nbsp;kg, have a diameter of 16–17&amp;nbsp;cm and have no finger or hand-holes. There are four pins arranged in a triangle with the point towards the players. The one closes to the ''parra'' is the ''cantón'', to the back and left is the ''carraca'', to the back and right the ''guarda'' and directly behind the ''cantón'' sits the ''medio''. The distance between the ''carraca'' and the ''guarda'' is about 2.4m.

The players must launch the ball onto the ''loma'', stay on it (otherwise a foul is declared which is called ''zula'') and at the very least knock over the ''cantón'' to score. The aim is to knock all four over but if the ball rebounds from the side panels and knocks over a pin, they do not count. Currently, there are over 1000 registered bowlers and more than one hundred ''bolatoki'' of this style remain predominantly in the central part of Álava. The most important competition is the annual [http://www.clubaraba.com/ Torneo Interpueblos].

===Bederatzi txirlo jokoa===
The history museum of [[Bayonne|Baiona]] has a historic exhibit of a ''bederatzi txirlo jokoa'' or "nine pin skittles" with pins of almost a meter in height. ''Bolo jokoak'' are not commonly played in this part of the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] anymore but the game is assumed to have been played along the lines of the [[Béarn|Bearnese]] game called ''quilhas de nau'' and ''quilles de neuf'' in [[French language|French]].

===Bermeo bowls===
[[Image:Bermeoko bola jokoa.png|65px|thumb|left|''Bermeoko bola jokoa'']]
Called ''Bermeoko bola jokoa'' in Basque and ''bolo de [[Bermeo]]'' in Spanish. The last ''bolatoki'' for this version disappeared in the 1940s and '50s. The playing area for this version is rectangular, 13.5&amp;nbsp;m long and 1.5&amp;nbsp;m wide. At the player's end there are two launch boards sunken into the ground, parallel to each other at either side of the playing area. As in many ''bola jokoak'' the balls are launched onto the wooden planks because it helps maintain the forward speed of a ball, whereas launching it onto a dirt floor would tend to slow them down.  At the far end, woode planks were fixed to the side panels to create a semi-[[hexagon]]. This game uses 4 pins, three ''nagusiak'' or "main ones" and one ''bostekoa'' or "one of five". The ''nagusiak'' are arranged in a triangle following the line of the semi-hexagon. The ''bostekoa'' is placed in front of either of the ''nagusiak'', left or right depending on the direction of the game. The ball has two holes, one for the thumb and a larger one for the remaining four fingers. The game proceeds as follows:

*The players must launch the ball onto the launching planks to begin with. If the board is not hit, a ''txorra'' or ''toto'' is declared (foul) and the player gets zero points.
*The ''bostekoa'' (worth five points) must be hit first as it determines the direction of play. If the board is hit but no pin, six points are awarded.
*Following the ''bostekoa'' the ball will rebound from the side panels and ideally hit the big pins. The two ''nagusiak'' closest to the player are worth eight points each, the ''nagusia'' furthest away nine points.

If all ''nagusiak'' are knocked over, only 14 points are awarded however so with the ''bostekoa'' the maximum number of points is 19. The aim of the game is to reach 300 first.

===Burgos bowls===
The Basque name, ''Burgosko bola jokoa'' translates as "bowls from [[Burgos]]", ''bolo burgalés'' in Spanish. This variant arrived in the Basque Country late when some people from Burgos brought it to [[Basauri]] in 1980 and to [[Gasteiz]] in 1985. Since its spread to areas outside Burgos, championships have been held involving clubs from [[Burgos]], [[Biscay]] and [[Álava]].

The main characteristic of ''Burgosko bola'' is that it is played on two different levels, involving a ''goiko jokoa'' or "high game" (''juego alto'' in Spanish) and a ''beheko jokoa'' "low game" or ''barruko jokoa'' "inside game" (''juego bajo'' or ''juego interior'' in Spanish).

===Ea bowls===
[[Image:Ea aldekoa.png|55px|thumb|right|''Ea aldekoa'']]
This is called ''Ea aldekoa'' in Basque and ''juego de [[Ea, Biscay|Ea]]'' in Spanish. This version is played on a sunken dirt playing field about 23&amp;nbsp;m by 1.8&amp;nbsp;m. The bowls have finger and hand-holes and weigh 8&amp;nbsp;kg and must be launched onto a 4m long platform in the playing area for the throw to be valid. The aim is to knock down 10 pins at the other end, 9 large ones (45&amp;nbsp;cm tall) and a small one (half the size of the big ones) in front of the big ones either at the centre, left of right.

The big pins are arranged in groups of three (one behind each other) in three lines at the far end of the track. A player has to hit the small pin (worth five points) first for it to be a valid throw, the other pins are worth one point each. Unlike in other variants, pins knocked over by a ball rebounding from the side panels also count.

There are two ''bolatoki'' left for this variant, one in [[Bedaroa]] and one in [[Natxitua]]. The one in [[Bedaroa]] is played mainly during town festivals.

===Hiru oholtzar===
[[Image:Hiru oholtzar.png|150px|thumb|left|''Hiru oholtzar'']]
Originally from the [[Burgos]] area and called ''tres tablones'' in Spanish, this version was brought to the west of Biscay by migrants. This is a visually spectacular variant on a 30&amp;nbsp;m by 6&amp;nbsp;m playing field, balls weighing between 5–7&amp;nbsp;kg with a 28&amp;nbsp;cm diameter which are launched at nine slim, pointed 35–40&amp;nbsp;cm tall pins arranged in a square, one behind the other in groups of three. They are each worth one points except for the one at the center of the square which is worth two. The aim is to scatter the pins as far away from their original location as possible. There is also a smaller 20&amp;nbsp;cm tall pin called ''miko'' or ''cuatro'' (because it is worth four points). Depending on they type of game, each player has 2&amp;ndash;4 balls per round and the ''miko'' is placed in two different positions behind the big pins.

In this variant, the ball and the central playing area are kept wet and the player launches the ball into the air and at the central row of pins using spin in an attempt to also catch the ''miko'' which is at the back and to the left or right of the central row. For a valid throw, the ball must pass a line in front of the pins in the air, touch down onto one of the platforms on which the pins stand and pass a line at the back on the ground to be a valid throw. Fouls are designated as follows:
*a ''morra'' is declared if the ball touches down before it reaches the pin platforms
*a ''zula'' is declared if the ball does not reach the back line
*a ''blanca'' is declared if the ball does not knock over and pins

In all these cases the throw is invalid and the player may not bowl again in this round.

Once a valid ball has come to rest past the line at the back, the player crosses over to the back area called ''cas de birle'' and is allowed to throw a second time from where the ball stopped but the ''miko'' is removed. Again, the throw has to be through the air until it touches down on a pin platform. There are usually also markers at the back indicating the lines of the pins.

It is a very popular game both in Biscay and [[Cantabria]].

===Kanaleko hiru txirlo===
[[Image:Kanaleko hiru txirlo.png|150px|thumb|right|''Kanaleko hiru txirlo'']]
Called ''hiru txirlo común'' in Spanish), this is a variant of [[bola jokoa]] played in the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]]. The name ''kanaleko hiru txirlo'' literally translates as "3 pins of the canal" but it also goes by the name of ''hiru txirlo arrunta'' (common three pins). This game is still fairly widespread in the east of Biscay from [[Mendiola]] to [[Mutriku]] and parts of [[Gipuzkoa]] (the [[Deba, Gipuzkoa|Deba]] valley), there are bolo federations for this variant at the cross-provincial level and annual leagues.

The game is played under a roof on a playing area about 25m long and 2.5m wide. In this variant the balls are 2.5&amp;nbsp;kg heavy, made of wood with finger and hand holes and are not entirely spherical. Each player has two of these. There are three 21&amp;nbsp;cm tall pins with a 5&amp;nbsp;cm diameter are arranged in a line one behind the other with 1m gaps between them. These have names in [[Basque language|Basque]]:
*the one closest to the players is called the ''eskua'' (hand)
*the middle one ''zilla'' or ''erdikoa'' (the middle one)
*the one furthest away ''guena''.

Between the pins and the launching area there is a 19&amp;nbsp;m long, narrow elevated canal called ''kanala'', ''pista'' or ''ibilbidea'' (walkway), located on the right hand side of the playing area. The lower lying dirt floor on the left is called the ''kalea'' (street).  The ball must be rolled onto a launching plate and towards the pins along the elevated ''pista''. The aim is to knock down the pins without the ball falling into the ''kalea''. This is the trickiest part of the game and various techniques are employed to keep the ball on track such as:
*''azpijana eman'', to add [[backspin]]
*''gainjana eman'', to add [[topspin]]

When launched, the ball must hit the launch plate otherwise a ''ohol-hutsa'' is declared and the throw is invalid. If the ball stays on the canal but doesn't hit any pins, a ''gain-huts'' (top zero) is declared, if the middle one is left standing an ''erdikuts'' (middle zero) is declared. The maximum one can make is three per throw, either by knocking the pins over with the ball or by a pin knocking another pin. Pins knocked over by a ball rebounding from the sides do not count.

Bets are placed either by guessing the number of pins that will or will not get knocked over using the following phrases:
*''bat baietz'' (one yes), ''bi baietz'' (two yes), ''hiru baietz'' (three yes)
or
*''bat ezetz'' (one no), ''bi ezetz'' (two no), ''hiru ezetz'' (three no)

===Katxete===
[[Image:Katxete.png|250px|thumb|left|''Katxete'']]
This version (''bolos a cachete'', "smack bowling" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) is played in the mining area of the [[Enkarterri]] today although ''bolatokiak'' also exist in Biscay, in the area from [[Barakaldo]] to [[Muzkiz]]. A ''bolatoki'' for this game is also called a ''carrejo'' and was formerly often played on [[threshing floor]]s.

The ball in ''katxete'' weighs 3.5–4&amp;nbsp;kg and have not hand or finger-holes. The 4-6 pins weigh 1&amp;nbsp;kg, are about 9&amp;nbsp;cm tall and are [[oblate spheroid]]s. They need to have this flattened shape because the ''tako'' ("woodblock") upon which they are placed isn't level but has an inclined surface, the end furthest away from the player being higher up. They are arranged in a V shape, with the point of the V pointing away from the player. Right in front of the ''tako'' is the ''ur putzua'' or "water puddle". The purpose of the puddle is that the player's helper (called ''armador'') can wet the pins and the ''tako'' before the shot.

The aim is to knock the pins across the lawn over one of two semicircles, called ''marrak'' (lines), delineating the edge of the ''bolatoki''. The first ''marra'' is 10m away from the ''tako'' and the second 18.5m. To score a point, the pins have to pass the first ''marra'', otherwise a ''txorra'' is declared and no points are scored. If a pin passes the second ''marra'', it is worth two points and a game usually is played to 200 or 300 points.

There are up to 20 ''bolatoki'' for this variant and there are federations at the provincial level and annual league games.

===León bowls===
[[Image:Blbola1.jpg|150px|thumb|left|A bola for León bowls]]
Called ''Leongo jokoa'' in Basque and ''juego leonés'' in Spanish and as the name suggests, this variant comes from the pronvince of [[León (province)|León]] but is common throughout [[Spain]] today. In the Basque Country it is played roughly in the area between [[Basauri]] and [[Portugalete]].

[[Image:Blbolera.png|150px|thumb|right|The playing area for León bowls]]
The minimum playing area for this game is 25&amp;ndash;30&amp;nbsp;m long and 9&amp;ndash;10&amp;nbsp;m wide, split into two main areas: the ''castro'' (castle) where the 10 pins are located and the rest of the playing area. There are nine large pins which are 55&amp;nbsp;cm tall and a smaller one called ''miche'' which is 30&amp;nbsp;cm tall. The nine large ones are arranged in a 3x3 square, the one at the centre being called ''medio''.

The wooden balls are the most extraordinary characteristic of this variant because they are [[sphere|hemispheres]] and weigh up to 1&amp;nbsp;kg. Around the ''castro'' are a number of lines:
*the ''hamaikaren marra'' or "line of 11" (''línea del once'' in Spanish), which goes from the ''chincón'' to the ''miche''
*the ''marra osagarria'' or "complementary line (''línea complementaria'' in Spanish) which goes from the ''miche'' to the third pin
*the ''parada'' which is a circle with a 2.25&amp;nbsp;m diameter around the ''castro''
*the ''sobrecastro'' which is 50&amp;nbsp;cm behind the ''castro''

There are two parts to a player's round. In the first, the player stands in the square launching area called ''mano'' at a distance of 6-22m from the ''castro'' to throw the ball through the air into the ''castro''. When it touches the ground (which is kept moist), it must neither stop there or rebound but spin onwards for the throw to be valid. At this stage scores are allocated as follows if the ball is valid and comes to rest inside the ''parada'':
*if the ball does not touch down in the ''castro'' a ''cinca'' is declared and the throw is worth no points
*if the ball only knocks over the ''medio'', the throw is worth two points
*if the ball does not knock over any pins or just one, the throw is worth six points
*if the ball knocks over two pins, the throw is worth seven points; any extra pin is worth an additional point

[[Image:Blcastro1.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The ''castro'']]
If the throw is valid and comes to rest outside the ''parada'', scores are allocated as follows:
*if the ball only knocks over the ''medio'', the throw is worth two points
*if no pins or just one pin is knocked over, the throw is worth one point
*if two pins are knocked over, the throw is worth two points; any extra pin is worth an additional point

There are also special combinations of pins knocked over and path of the ball which can be worth up to 16 points (called ''ahorcada''), for example if the ball touches down in the ''castro'', only knocks over the ''miche'' and then comes to rest inside the ''parada''.

In the second part, called ''birlaketa'' (''birle'' in Spanish), the player can bowl a second time towards the ''castro'' from where the ball landed provided it landed outside the ''parada'' circle. At this stage, if only the ''miche'' is knocked over, no point is awarded.

===Munadun erremontea===
[[Image:Munadun erremontea.png|150px|thumb|right|''Munadun erremontea'']]
This game is called also called ''Zornotza aldekoa'' or "the one from the [[Zornotza]] area", ''remonte con muna'' and ''juego de Zornotza'' in Spanish. This version was particularly common in Biscay roughly in the area between [[Zollo]] and [[Bernagoitia]] and is still fairly widespread, especially in the area of [[Amorebieta-Etxano]] where most ''bolatokiak'' are attached to rural churches. There are bolo federations at the provincial level and annual leagues for this variant.

It is played on a rectangular clay surface, 24&amp;ndash;27&amp;nbsp;m long and 4.5&amp;ndash;5&amp;nbsp;m wide. The sides of the playing area rises upwards but the most obvious characteristic of this variant is the ''muna'', a ridge that runs down the middle of the playing area. At the far end it is delineated by the ''topea'', a wooden anel. The aim is to knock down ten pins, 9 large ones (up to 52&amp;nbsp;cm tall) arranged in a 3x3 square and a small one called ''txakina''. The balls weigh 10–12&amp;nbsp;kg and have a hand and finger-hole.

The player stands in the launching area to throw the ball which must touch down in the ''ohola'' or landing area just past the launching area, consisting of a number of sunken boards. This area is about 3&amp;nbsp;m long and if the ball does not touch down here first, it is declared ''lur'' (ground) and invalid. The ball then travels down some 15m on the ground, sides or ''muna'' to reach the area of the pins.

The large pins are worth one point each except the one at the centre of the square which is worth two. The ''txakina'' is worth either six or ten points and can be placed just about anywhere within the playing area and the maximum number of points in a throw is 20. Other throws are calculated as follows for a valid ball:
*if it passes all pins on either side and hits the ''topea'', the throw is worth five points
*if it passes through all pins without knocking down any and hits the ''topea'', the throw is worth six points
*if it knocks over the ''txakina'' and the central pin, the throw is worth 12 points
*if it knocks over the ''txakina'' and at least one other pin, the throw is worth 11 points

There are other special throws which depend on the placement of the ''txakina'' apart from the above and some vary from area to area.

===Oholtzar pasaboloa===
[[Image:Oholtzar pasaboloa.png|110px|thumb|right|''Oholtzar pasaboloa'']]
This version is common even today in [[Cantabria]] and [[Biscay]] in the area roughly between the river [[Asón]] and the river [[Ibaizabal]] and as far south as [[Burgos]], called ''pasabolo de tablón'' in Spanish.

There are three parts to the playing field in this game. The first is the launching area, about 6m long, where the player takes a run to launch the ball. The ball weighs 5–7&amp;nbsp;kg and has finger and hand-holes. It the travels down a shallow groove about 8m long, the ''oholtzarra'' (''cureño'' or ''tablón'' in Spanish). At the far end three light pins, weighing about 100g each (the lightest of all pins used in Basque bowling games) which are set in holes in the ground, one behind the other. Both the ''oholtzarra'' and the pin area are kept wet in this game to minimise friction. Not far behind the pins is a barrier (called ''paraboloa'') to stop the ball but behind the barrier the actually target area lies, the ''marren zelaia'' "field of lines" (''campo de rayas'' in Spanish), 20m wide and 40m long. The lines are parallel to each other and at a distance of 5m and important for scoring.

The basic aim of the game is to hit the pins with enough force to propel them over the barrier and as far into the field as possible. Skill is needed to keep the ball in the groove and hit the pins head on, otherwise they tend to go sideways rather than forward. If a pin lands in the area up to the first line, it is worth 10 points and each additional line another 10 so the maximum score per bowl is 210 points if all land past the 6th line. In a game each player has eight balls and the highest scorer wins.

===Olazabal bowls===
[[Image:Olazabalgo bola jokoa.png|130px|thumb|left|''Olazabalgo bolo jokoa'']]
''Olazabalgo bolo jokoa'', the game from Olazabal, a borough of the town of [[Dima, Spain|Dima]]. The game also known as ''Olazabalgo zazpi boloen jokoa'' (called ''juego de siete bolos de Olazabal'' in Spanish) - "the seven pin game from Olazabal". There is only one known ''bolatoki'' for this variant. The rules and setup resembles those of ''munadun erremontea'' somewhat and it geographically played within the same area, suggesting it may well be a variant that developed from ''munadun erremontea''.

This dirt ''bolatoki'' is outdoors, set under trees in a park. The balls used have finger and hand-holes and usually weigh 5–6&amp;nbsp;kg. There are only six large pins (36&amp;nbsp;cm tall) and a small ''txirlo'' (26&amp;nbsp;cm tall). The playing area is rectangular, about 20m long and 4m wide. The main characteristic of the playing area is that the middle part has both an ''erdiko muna'' (central ''muna'') and sloping sides, effectively creating two parallel wide channels. The pins are set in a slightly diagonal line in groups of three, one at the other end of each "channel", the small ''txirlo'' sits in between them but there is no special platform for them as in other varieties. At the player's end there are two launching platforms, one in front of either channel.

To score, a player has to launch a ball onto the launching platform down either channel. For the throw to be valid, it also has to travel onto the ''muna'' or the left or right slope. It then knocks down pins (who in turn may knock down other pins) but also has to hit the barrier at the far end or a ''txorra'' is declared and the throw is invalid. All pins are worth only one point each.

In theory it is possible to score more than 4 points but this has not happened in living memory.

===Tres Tablones===
This variant is originally from the [[Merindades]], in the north of Spain but nowadays is played in Burgos, the Basque Country, Madrid, Alicante and in some South America.

The bowling alley is divided into three differente areas: The launching area, pin area and ''Birle'' area. The bowling balls have finger and hand-holes, are 26–28&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and usually weight between 6 and 8&amp;nbsp;kg. There are three boards (''tablones'' or ''cureñas'') and three pins on each one, there is a small pin which is situated outside of the boards and is the most important one.
    
The game starts the bowling ball being thrown from the launchig area (''cas'') through the air, trying to bring down as many pins as possible and the small pin (the ''mico''). The first bounce of the bowling ball must be on the board, otherwise it will be discounted (a ''morra''). Scoring is as follows: each pin knocked down is worth one point, the middle pin knocked over on its own is worth two points, and knocking over the small pin is worth four points, only if another pin has been knocked down.

===Zabaleko hiru txirlo===
[[Image:Zabaleko hiru txirlo.png|65px|thumb|right|''Zabaleko hiru txirlo'']]
This three pin game is also called ''Berrizko hiru txirlo'' or ''hiru txirlo de Berriz'' in Spanish.

Most ''bolatoki'' for this variant are in the area around [[Berriz]] in [[Biscay]], most notably the one attached to the small church (a type called [[Baserri|baseliza]] in Basque) of San Lorenzo of [[Mendibil]].

The playing area is about 18-20m long and 1.5-2.5m wide and consists of a slightly sunk dirt (or sand) area which uses the slope and (in most cases) a church wall as a border on one side. The wooden balls weight about 2&amp;nbsp;kg and there are only three 21&amp;nbsp;cm tall pins. These are arranged in a line, one behind each other, very close to the wall.

The main characteristic of this game is a triangular barrier called ''motie'' which prevents players from bowling directly at the pins. Instead, players launch the ball onto a launching platform, aiming for the incline opposite the wall and the pins, with the intentions of letting the ball curve around and hit the pins from the side.

Each player bowls two balls and the pins are worth one point each but pins knocked over by balls rebounding off the back panel do not count.

===Zeanuri bowls===
[[Image:Zeanuriko bola jokoa.png|95px|thumb|left|''Zeanuriko bola jokoa'']]
This variant is called ''Zeanuriko bola jokoa' in Basque and ''juego de Zeanuri'' in Spanish and played around the area of [[Zeanuri]] in [[Biscay]] only.

Four ''bolatoki'' for this variant remain, 19-26m in length and 2.5-3.5m in width with a launching platform at the player's end and an end panel at the far end called ''zubile''. Roughly half way down the playing are there is a small stake on the left slope called ''katxine''. There are four pins, three large ones (41&amp;nbsp;cm tall) and a small one (25&amp;nbsp;cm tall), arranged in the shape of an [[equilateral triangle]] with the point towards the player, the three large pins on the side going off to the right and the small pin at the far left corner. All pins are worth one point each. The balls for this game have finger and hand-holes and weigh 7&amp;nbsp;kg.

There are different ways of playing this game. Players either place an amount of money before the game called the ''arrapea'' and then get to bowl three balls (if played in teams, then there are three balls per team). In the other version, the ''arrapea'' is placed and each player or team has six balls but only the best throw is counted.

Players launch their balls onto the launching platform and most come off the left slope before hitting any pins but if the ''katxine'' is hit, the throw is invalid. Pins knocked over by a rebounding ball do not count but the ball must hit the ''zubile'' otherwise a ''txorra'' is declared and the throw is invalid. Scoring works as follows for valid balls:
*if only the small pin is knocked over, the throw is not worth any points
*if one of the large pins knocks over the small pin, the throw is worth four points

==History==
The earliest historical records which mention ''bola jokoak'' are almost all records of writers complaining about the game as a sign of moral decay or administrative records of forbidding the play of such games on the streets. A law from [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] dating back to 1627 for example penalised the playing of bowls on the streets of the city, as did the council of [[Ulibarri-Jauregi]] 1632.

Probably the first document to give us a limited insight into the actual gameplay comes from the 1726 dictionary of the ''Real Academia de la Lengua Española'' which gives a very brief outline of a game very similar to ''bolo palma''.

Up until the end of the 19th century most neighbourhoods would have a playing area where the locals would play and bet the payment of their drinks (often [[txakoli]] or [[cider]]) on their bowling skills. Due to the suspicion of the [[Catholic church]] and the nobility such activities, many bowling courts were historically located near churches.

The first over-regional competition was organised by the council of [[Gasteiz]] in 1949 with players from all over [[Álava]] competing for 3 prizes of 500 [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] and a trophy. Competitions at all levels have been held in various places since.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5613">{{About|the history and usage of the word '''bioneer'''|the annual conference|Bioneers}}

'''Bioneer''' (root: "biological pioneer") is a [[neologism]] coined by filmmaker, author and eco-activist [[Kenny Ausubel]].&lt;ref name="utne"&gt;Utne Reader. (1999 Mar-Apr). [http://www.utne.com/cgi-bin/udt/im.display.printable?client.id=utne&amp;story.id=2 "15 Ideas That Could Shake the World"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928035518/http://www.utne.com/cgi-bin/udt/im.display.printable?client.id=utne&amp;story.id=2 |date=September 28, 2007 }}. ''[[Utne Reader]]''. Retrieved on 2007-03-20.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Utne Reader]]'', a bioneer is "a biological pioneer, an ecological inventor who's got an elegant and often simple set of solutions for environmental conundrums."&lt;ref name="utne"/&gt; As coined by Ausubel, the term describes individuals and groups working in diverse disciplines who have crafted creative solutions to various [[ecosystem|environmental]] and socio-cultural problems rooted in shared core values, including [[Holistic#See also|whole systems]], ([[Buckminster Fuller#Neologisms|anticipatory]]) thinking, a view of all life as interdependent, and sustainable mutual aid.

The greatest use of the term since its coinage has been in relation to the annual [[Bioneers]] conference founded by Ausubel and his wife [[Nina Simons]] and held annually in [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]], [[California]], and its participants. However, in recent years the term or derivations has seen increasing use independent of the Bioneers organization, suggesting an increasing acceptance of the term in popular usage. For example, a 2005 article on the use and manufacture of [[biodiesel]] fuels in northern [[California]] was titled "Bioneering Biodiesel."&lt;ref&gt;Holland, Laura McHale. (2005 August).[http://www.northbaybiz.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3877&amp;Itemid=0&amp;search_keywords=biodiesel "Bioneering Biodiesel: Local entrepreneurs bet on biodiesel to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and clean the air."]. ''[[NorthBay Biz]]''. Retrieved on 2007-03-20.&lt;/ref&gt; An April 2007 symposium and art exhibition at [[University of California, Irvine]] focused on food production, consumption, and distribution was called "Bioneering: Hybrid Investigations of Food."&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Lisa, curator. (2007). [http://yin.arts.uci.edu/~tucker/ Bioneering: Hybrid Investigations of Food] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20070420145532/http://yin.arts.uci.edu/~tucker/ |date=April 20, 2007 }} (symposium). [[University of California, Irvine]]. Retrieved on 2007-03-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other usage==

''Bioneer'' and its derivations have also been used in relationship to [[biotechnology]]. This usage of the term appears to come from independent coinages based on a [[portmanteau]] of "biotechnology" and "engineering" and/or "pioneering". The [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] drug-screening company Bioneering Technologies describes itself as being focused on "the fusion between biotechnology, engineering, and pioneering services (hence, Bioneering)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioneering.com/ Bioneering Technologies]. (2006-2007). [http://www.bioneering.com/About "Drug Discovery Services That Make Sense."] Retrieved on 2007-03-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Students in the Bachelor of Biotechnology Innovation program at [[Queensland University of Technology]] in [[Brisbane, Australia|Brisbane]], [[Australia]] called themselves ''bioneers'' "as they regard themselves as pioneering a new era in biotechnology."&lt;ref&gt;Collet, Chris and Wyatt, David. (2005). [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/archive/00002541/ "Bioneering" - teaching biotechnology entrepreneurship at the undergraduate level.] ''Education + Training'' 47(6): 408-421. Retrieved on 2007-03-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Korea]]-based international biotechnology firm Korea Biotech, Inc., founded in 1992, changed its name in 1996 to Bioneer Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioneer.com/ Bioneer Corporation]. (2005). [http://eng.bioneer.com/ "History"]. Retrieved on 2007-03-20.&lt;/ref&gt;
Bioneer is also a term adopted by those who visit the Biomatrix website for self-improvement. This site and forum advocated the use of bodybuilding,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.flexxlabs.com|title = Bodybuilding Technology Discoveries|date = |accessdate = |website = Insights Into Bioneering And Socio-Cultural Problems|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; training and technology to improve not only one's muscles (as would a bodybuilder) but also your other physical attributes such as speed, agility and intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-biomatrix.net/ The-Biomatrix.Net]. (2010). [http://www.the-biomatrix.net Index Page]. Retrieved on 2010-08-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference between usages==

While Ausubel's coinage does not specifically refer to biotechnology, the second coinage of ''bioneer'' referring to biotechnology is clearly antithetical to the term as understood by Ausubel and those influenced by him and the [[Bioneers]] organization. In the book ''Nature's Operating Instructions: The True Biotechnologies'' (coedited with J. P. Harpignies), Ausubel has made a clear distinction between corporate [[biotechnology|biotech]], including [[genetic engineering]], which he decries, and what he has termed "true biotechnologies" based on [[biomimicry]], natural design, and the restoration of [[natural capital]].&lt;ref&gt;Ausubel, Kenny, and J. P. Harpignies, eds. (2004) ''Nature's Operating Instructions: The True Biotechnologies''. The Bioneers Series. Sierra Club Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Brooks v Canada Safeway Ltd''''' [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1219 is a leading [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on employer discrimination of [[pregnancy|pregnant]] employees. The Court found that [[Safeway (Canada)|Safeway]] violated the provincial Human Rights Act by failing to provide equal compensation for those who missed work due to pregnancy. This decision overturned the controversial case of ''[[Bliss v. Attorney General of Canada]]'', [1979].

In 1982, Susan Brooks, Patricia Allen and Patricia Dixon were all part-time cashiers at Safeway who became pregnant. The Safeway insurance plan that provided benefits for loss of pay due to accident or sickness did not give full benefits for 17 weeks for those who were unable to work due to pregnancy. The three women brought claims against Safeway for discriminating on the basis of pregnancy for discrimination based on sex. The Court held unanimously that the insurance policy was discriminating against pregnant women.

The '''Center for research on Children, Adolescents and the Media (CCAM)''' at the [[University of Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]], was founded in 2005 by [[Patti Valkenburg]]. Since then, it has grown into one of the largest research centers in its kind worldwide.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} CCAM hosts 25 international researchers from 9 academic disciplines. It is part of the [[Amsterdam School of Communication Research]] ASCoR. Since 2009, CCAM researchers have organized an international master program on Youth and Media.

==Focus==

Children and adolescents have become the defining users of [[media (communication)|media]] and technologies. Despite a booming media industry aimed at young people, little is known about the uses and effects of these media and technologies. CCAM strives to better understand the role of media in [[children]]'s and adolescents' lives. What are the intended and unintended effects of [[advertising]]? Which children are particularly susceptible to potential negative effects of advertising, pornography, and media [[violence]]? When do [[social media]] have positive and negative influences on young people? Researchers in CCAM have published dozens of articles and chapters that provide answers on questions like these.

==Open access==

CCAM has an [[open access]] policy. All publications can be downloaded from the publication section. In addition, all instruments that CCAM researchers have created to investigate their theories and models are freely accessible via the website of CCAM.

==Knowledge dissemination==

Research within CCAM is targeted at an academic audience as well as the public at large. Every three months, the center publishes a news bulletin to inform the broader audience of the latest research insights.

'''Crimean Tatars''' or '''Crimeans''' ([[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]]: {{lang|crh|Qırımtatarlar, qırımlar}}; {{lang-tr|Kırım Tatarları, kırımlar}}; {{lang-ru|Крымские Татары, крымцы}}; {{lang-uk|Кримськi Татари, кримцi}}) are a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] ethnic group that formed in the [[Crimean Peninsula]] during the 13th–17th centuries, primarily from Islamic Turkic tribes from the Asian steppes that invaded the Greek-settled land now known as Crimea, in Eastern Europe, beginning in the 10th century, with contributions from the pre-Cuman population of Crimea. Since 2014 the Crimean Tatars have been officially recognized as an indigenous people of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dt.ua/POLITICS/rada-viznala-krimskih-tatar-korinnim-narodom-u-skladi-ukrayini-140021_.html Verkhovna Rada recognized Crimean Tatars indigenous people of Ukraine (Рада визнала кримських татар корінним народом у складі України)].

Crimean Tatars constituted the majority of Crimea's population from the time of its [[ethnogenesis]] until the mid-19th century, and the relative largest ethnic population until the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Illarionov |first=A. |title=The ethnic composition of Crimea during three centuries |work=Institute of Economical Analysis |location=Moscow, R.F. |year=2014 |language=Russian |url=http://aillarionov.livejournal.com/607335.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305162246/http://aillarionov.livejournal.com/607335.html |archivedate=5 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Troynitski, N.A. |title=First General Census of Russian Empire's Population, 1897 (Первая Всеобщая перепись населения Российской Империи 1897 г.

Starting in 1967, some were allowed to return to Crimea, and in 1989 the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] condemned the [[ethnic cleansing|removal of Crimean Tatars from their motherland]] as inhumane and lawless. Today, Crimean Tatars constitute approximately 12% of the population of Crimea. There remains a [[Crimean Tatar diaspora|large diaspora]] of Crimean Tatars in [[Turkey]] and [[Uzbekistan]].

In the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|latest Ukrainian census]], 248,200 Ukrainian citizens identified themselves as Crimean Tatars with 98% (or about 243,400) of them living in the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]].&lt;ref name="2001CensusUkraine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/nationality/ |title=About number and composition population of UKRAINE by data All-Ukrainian population census' |work=[[Ukrainian Census (2001)]] |publisher=State Statistics Committee of Ukraine |accessdate=20 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217151026/http://2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/nationality/ |archivedate=17 December 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/nationality/Crimea/ |title=About number and composition population of AUTONOMOUS REPUBLIC OF CRIMEA by data All-Ukrainian population census' |work=[[Ukrainian Census (2001)]] |publisher=State Statistics Committee of Ukraine |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional 1,800 citizens (or about 0.7% of those that identified themselves as Crimean Tatars) live in the city of [[Sevastopol]], also on the [[Crimean peninsula]], but outside the border of the autonomous republic.&lt;ref name="2001CensusUkraine"/&gt;

The official number of Crimean Tatars in Turkey is 150,000 with some Crimean Tatar activists estimating a figure as high as 6 million.

==Sub-ethnic groups==
The Crimean Tatars are subdivided into three (or sometimes four) sub-ethnic groups:

*the Tats (not to be confused with the Iranic [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tat people]], living in the [[Caucasus]] region) who used to inhabit the mountainous Crimea before 1944 (about 55%) predominantly are Tatarized Greeks, Goths and other people, as Tats in Crimea also were called Hellenic [[Urum people]] (Crimean Greeks) who were deported by the Imperial Russia to the area around [[Mariupol]];&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt;
*the Yalıboyu who lived on the southern coast of the peninsula (about 30%) partially also the Crimean Turks,&lt;ref name=eohou&gt;[http://resource.history.org.ua/cgi-bin/eiu/history.exe?Z21ID=&amp;I21DBN=EIU&amp;P21DBN=EIU&amp;S21STN=1&amp;S21REF=10&amp;S21FMT=eiu_all&amp;C21COM=S&amp;S21CNR=20&amp;S21P01=0&amp;S21P02=0&amp;S21P03=TRN=&amp;S21COLORTERMS=0&amp;S21STR=Krimski_Tatari Crimean Tatars (КРИМСЬКІ ТАТАРИ)].

Historians suggest that inhabitants of the mountainous parts of Crimea lying to the central and southern parts (the Tats), and those of the Southern coast of Crimea (the Yalıboyu) were the direct descendants of the [[Pontic Greeks]], [[Armenians]], [[Scythians]], [[Ostrogoths]] ([[Crimean Goths#Disappearance|Crimean Goths]]) and [[Kipchaks]] along with the [[Cumans]] while the latest inhabitants of the northern steppe represent the descendants of the [[Nogai Horde#Society|Nogai Horde]] of the Black Sea nominally subjects of the Crimean Khan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iccrimea.org/scholarly/bwilliams.html |title=The Crimean Tatars: The Diaspora Experience and the Forging of a Nation |publisher=Iccrimea.org |date=1944-05-18 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khodarkovsky – Russia's Steppe Frontier p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; It is largely assumed that the Tatarization process that mostly took place in the 16th century brought a sense of cultural unity through the blending of the [[Greeks]], [[Armenians]], [[Italians]] and [[Ottoman Turks]] of the southern coast, [[Crimean Goths|Goths]] of the central mountains, and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking [[Kipchaks]] and [[Cumans]] of the steppe and forming of the Crimean Tatar ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, BG.

The Mongol conquest of the Kipchaks led to a merged society with the Mongol ruling class over a Kipchak speaking population which came to be known as Tatar and which eventually absorbed other ethnicities on the Crimean peninsula like Armenians, Italians, Greeks, and Goths to form the modern day Crimean Tatar people- up to the Soviet deportation, the Crimean Tatars could still differentiate among themselves between Tatar Kipchak Nogays and the "Tat" descendants of Tatarized Goths and other Turkified peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Brian Glyn. 2001. “The Ethnogenesis of the Crimean Tatars.

==History==
{{Main article|History of Crimea}}

===Origin===

Crimea has experienced many migratory and conquering races in its history. The [[Turkic people|Turkic]] [[Kipchaks]] had followed the [[Goths]], [[Huns]], [[Sarmatians]] and [[Scythians]] in Crimea. The [[Mongols]] who [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|invaded the Russian principalities]] under [[Batu Khan]], conducted the Kipchaks of south Ukrainain plains into their forces in 1240s. This amalgam of Mongols and Kipchkaks which gradually converted to Islam became known as "[[Tatars]]". The Tatars of Crimea and the neighboring steppes continued their domination even with the decline of Mongol rule in 1300s. The [[Great stand on the Ugra river|liberation of Russia]] from the [[Golden Horde]] in 1480 too couldn't end their power and by this time the Tatar [[Giray dynasty]] had already established an independent [[khanate]] in Crimea and neighboring territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xabnCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR12&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI1JbIk7DZAhUhTI8KHWoTDLIQ6AEIJzAB#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Crimean Tatars: From Soviet Genocide to Putin's Conquest|author=[[Brian Glyn Williams]]|page=xi-xii|year=2015|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crimean Tatars emerged as a nation at the time of the [[Crimean Khanate]], an [[Ottoman vassal state]] during the 15th to 18th centuries and one of the great centers of [[Crimean-Nogai raids into East Slavic lands|slave trade]] to the Ottoman Empire. The Turkic-speaking population of Crimea had mostly adopted Islam already in the 14th century,  following the conversion of [[Ozbeg Khan]] of the [[Golden Horde]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, BG. The Crimean Tatars: The Diaspora Experience and the Forging of a Nation. Pg 12. {{ISBN|90-04-12122-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time of the first Russian invasion of Crimea in 1736, the Khan's archives and libraries were famous throughout the Islamic world, and under Khan [[Krym-Girei]] the city of [[Simferopol]] was endowed with piped water, sewerage and a theatre where [[Molière]] was performed in French, while the port of [[Yevpatoria|Gözleve]] stood comparison with [[Rotterdam]] and [[Bakhchysarai]], the capital, was described as Europe's cleanest and greenest city.&lt;ref name="Rayfield, Donald p 15"&gt;Rayfield, Donald, 2014: "Dormant claims", ''Times Literary Supplement'', 9 May 2014 p 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Eizo Matsuki, ''Mediterranean Studies Group at Hitotsubashi University.''&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time, until the late 18th century, the Crimean Khanate maintained a massive [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|slave trade]] with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East which was the most important basis of its economy.&lt;ref name="raids"&gt;{{cite web |author=Mikhail Kizilov |title=Slave Trade in the Early Modern Crimea From the Perspective of Christian, Muslim, and Jewish Sources |url=https://www.academia.edu/2971600/Slave_Trade_in_the_Early_Modern_Crimea_From_the_Perspective_of_Christian_Muslim_and_Jewish_Sources |work=Oxford University|pages=2–7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most important trading ports and slave markets was [[Kefe]].&lt;ref name="matsuki"/&gt; Slaves and freedmen formed approximately 75% of the Crimean population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 Slavery].

The Russo-Turkish War (1768–74) resulted in the defeat of the Ottomans by the Russians, and according to the [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]] (1774) signed after the war, Crimea became independent and the Ottomans renounced their political right to protect the Crimean Khanate. After a period of political unrest in Crimea, Russia violated the treaty and [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire|annexed]] the Crimean Khanate in 1783. After the annexation, the wealthier Tatars, who had exported wheat, meat, fish and wine to other parts of the Black Sea, began to be expelled and to move to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Further expulsions followed in 1812 for fear of the reliability of the Tatars in the face of Napoleon's advance.  Particularly, the [[Crimean War]] of 1853–1856, the laws of 1860–63, the Tsarist policy and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)]] caused an exodus of the Tatars; 12,000 boarded Allied ships in Sevastopol to escape the destruction of shelling, and were branded traitors by the Russian government.&lt;ref name="Rayfield, Donald p 15"/&gt; Of total Tatar population 300,000 of the [[Taurida Governorate]] about 200,000 Crimean Tatars emigrated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monderusse.revues.org/docannexe1800.html "''Hijra'' and Forced Migration from Nineteenth-Century Russia to the Ottoman Empire"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611035541/http://monderusse.revues.org/docannexe1800.html |date=11 June 2007 }}, by Bryan Glynn Williams, ''Cahiers du Monde russe'', 41/1,  2000, pp. 79–108.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Crimean Tatars perished in the process of emigration, including those who drowned while crossing the Black Sea. Today the descendants of these Crimeans form the [[Crimean Tatar diaspora]] in Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey.

The bilingual Crimean Tatar-Russian newspaper ''[[Dragoman#Etymology and variants|Terciman]]-Perevodchik'' he published in 1883–1914, functioned as an educational tool through which a national consciousness and modern thinking emerged among the entire Turkic-speaking population of the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name="Rayfield, Donald p 15"/&gt; His New Method ([[Jadid]]) schools, numbering 350 across the peninsula, helped create a new Crimean Tatar elite.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} 
The educated "Crimean Tatars" during this period refused the appellation of "Tatars" given to them by the Turks (which however in earlier times had also been used natively). They wished to be known simply as "Turks", and their language as "Turkish" (the Crimean Tatar language had indeed been substantially influenced by [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]).&lt;ref name="Brill1084"&gt;E.

After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] this new elite, which included [[Noman Çelebicihan]] and [[Cafer Seydamet]] proclaimed the first democratic republic in the Islamic world, named the [[Crimean People's Republic]] on 26 December 1917. However, this republic was short-lived and abolished by the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik uprising]] in January 1918.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The Soviet government's "collectivization" policies led to a major nationwide famine in [[Soviet famine of 1932–33|1931–33]]. During [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]], statesmen and intellectuals such as [[Veli Ibraimov]] and [[Bekir Çoban-zade]] (1893–1937), were imprisoned or executed on various charges.&lt;ref name="OneEurope"/&gt;

In May 1944, the entire Crimean Tatar population of Crimea was exiled to Central Asia, mainly to Uzbekistan, on the orders of Joseph Stalin, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Chairman of the USSR State Defense Committee. Although a great number of Crimean Tatar men served in the [[Red Army]] and took part in the partisan movement in Crimea during the war, the existence of the [[Tatar Legion]] in the [[Nazism|Nazi]] army and the collaboration of Crimean Tatar religious and political leaders with [[Hitler]] during the German occupation of Crimea provided the Soviet leadership with justification for accusing the entire Crimean Tatar population of being Nazi collaborators.  In actuality, much of this is Soviet revisionism as the persecution of "suspect nations" and most of the genocide of the Crimean Tatars preceded the war, while statements justifying it appear after the war – as the threat of war heightened Stalin’s perception of marginal and politically suspect populations as the potential source of an uprising in case of invasion. He began to plan for the preventive elimination of such potential recruits for a mythical “fifth column of wreckers, terrorists and spies.” (Hagenloh, 2000; Shearer, 2003).  Tatar historian Alan Fisher has said that between 1917 and 1933, 150,000 Tatars—about 50% of the population at the time—either were killed or forced out of Crimea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/116814/crimean-tatars-primer-why-population-opposes-putin|title=The Crimean Tatars: A Primer|author=|date=|website=newrepublic.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Yitzhak Arad]], "In January 1942 a company of Tatar volunteers was established in Simferopol under the command of ''[[List of Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe 11]]''. This company participated in anti-[[Jew]]ish manhunts and murder actions in the rural regions."&lt;ref&gt;Yitzhak Arad (2009). "''The Holocaust in the Soviet Union''". U of Nebraska Press, p.211, {{ISBN|080322270X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern researchers argue that Crimea's geopolitical position{{which|date=March 2014}} fueled Soviet perceptions of Crimean Tatars as a potential threat.&lt;ref&gt;Aurélie Campana, Sürgün: [http://www.massviolence.org/Surgun-The-Crimean-Tatars-deportation-and-exile "The Crimean Tatars’ deportation and exile, Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence"], 16 June 2008. Retrieved 19 April 2012, ISSN 1961-9898 
&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is based in part on an analogy with numerous other cases of [[Involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union|deportations of non-Russians from boundary territories]], as well as the fact that other non-Russian populations, such as [[Greeks]], [[Armenians]] and [[Bulgarians]] were also removed from Crimea.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

All 240,000 Crimean Tatars were [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|deported]] ''en masse'', in a form of [[collective punishment]], on 17–18 May 1944 as [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|"special settlers"]] to the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]] and other distant parts of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Ukraine: A History | author=Subtelny, Orest | publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] | year=2000 | isbn=0-8020-8390-0 | page=483 | authorlink=Orest Subtelny}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event is called [[Sürgün]] in the [[Crimean Tatar language]]; the few who escaped were shot on sight or drowned in scuttled barges, and within months half their number had died of cold, hunger, exhaustion and disease.&lt;ref name="Rayfield, Donald p 15"/&gt; Many of them were re-located to toil as [[unfree labour|forced labourers]] in the Soviet [[GULAG]] system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,823132,00.html The Muzhik &amp; the Commissar], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', 30 November 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a 1967 Soviet decree removed the charges against Crimean Tatars, the Soviet government did nothing to facilitate their resettlement in Crimea and to make reparations for lost lives and confiscated property. Crimean Tatars, having a definite tradition of non-communist political dissent, succeeded in creating a truly independent network of activists, values and political experience.&lt;ref&gt;Buttino, Marco (1993).

===After Ukrainian independence===
{{see also|Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People}}
Today, more than 250,000 Crimean Tatars have returned to their homeland, struggling to re-establish their lives and reclaim their national and cultural rights against many social and economic obstacles. In 1991, the Crimean Tatar leadership founded the [[Kurultai]], or Parliament, to act as a representative body for the Crimean Tatars which could address grievances to the Ukrainian central government, the Crimean government, and international bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0220/p09s02-coop.html|title=A Lesson in Stifling Violent Extremism: Crimea's Tatars have created a promising model to lessen ethnoreligious conflict|accessdate=6 August 2007 |last=Ziad|first=Waleed|author2=Laryssa Chomiak|date=20 February 2007|work=CS Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People]] is the executive body of the Kurultai.

Since the 1990s till October 2013, the political leader of the Crimean Tatars and the chairman of the [[Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People]] was former [[Soviet dissidents|Soviet dissident]] [[Mustafa Abdülcemil Qırımoğlu]]. Since October 2013 the chairman of the [[Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People]] is [[Refat Chubarov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://qtmm.org/en/chairman|title=Chairman|website=qtmm.org|access-date=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2014 Russian annexation of Crimea]], Russian authorities declared the [[Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People]] to be an extremist organization, and banned it in 26 April 2016.&lt;ref name="MCTPb26416"&gt;[http://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2016/04/26/crimean-court-bans-tatar-ruling-body-in-blow-to-minority/ Crimean court bans Tatar ruling body in blow to minority], [[Thestar.com.my]] (26 April 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 Crimean crisis===
{{main article|Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation}}{{see also|Republic of Crimea#Crimean Tatars}}

Following news of Crimea's independence [[Crimean status referendum, 2014|referendum]] organized with the help of Russia on 16 March 2014,{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} the Kurultai leadership voiced concerns of renewed persecution, as commented by a U.S. official before the visit of a UN human rights team to the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.N. human rights team aims for quick access to Crimea - official|url=http://www.trust.org/item/20140319210920-t5yh9/|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Rustam Minnikhanov]], the president of [[Republic of Tatarstan|Tatarstan]] was dispatched to Crimea to quell Crimean Tatars' concerns and to point out that "in the 23 years of Ukraine's independence the Ukrainian leaders have been using Crimean Tatars as pawns in their political games without doing them any tangible favors". The issue of Crimean Tatar persecution by Russia has since been raised regularly on an international level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unpo.org/article/17913|title=UNPO: Crimean Tatars: Turkey Officially Condemns Persecution by Russia|author=|date=|website=unpo.org|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://politicalperiscope.com/crimean-tatars-russia/&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March 2014, the day Crimea was annexed by Russia, and Crimean Tatar was declared one of the three official languages of Crimea. It was also announced that Crimean Tatars will be required to relinquish coastal lands on which they squatted since their return to Crimea in early 1990s and be given land elsewhere in Crimea. Crimea stated it needed the relinquished land for "social purposes", since part of this land is occupied by the Crimean Tatars without legal documents of ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Temirgaliyev|first=Rustam|title=Crimean Deputy Prime Minister|url=http://en.ria.ru/world/20140319/188544777/Crimean-Tatars-Will-Have-to-Vacate-Land--Official.html|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation was caused by the inability of the USSR (and later Ukraine) to give back to the Tatars the land owned before deportation, once they or their descendants returned from Central Asia (mainly Uzbekistan). As a consequence, Crimean Tatars settled as squatters, occupying land that was and is still not legally registered.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Some Crimean Tatars fled to Mainland [[Ukraine]] due to the Crimean crisis - reportedly around 2000 by 23 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/crimeas-tatars-flee-ukraine-far-west-205336651.html#VFkyPxF|title=Crimea's Tatars flee for Ukraine far west|last=Trukhan|first=Vassyl|publisher= Yahoo|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On 29 March 2014, an emergency meeting of the Crimean Tatars representative body, the [[Kurultai]], voted in favor of seeking "ethnic and territorial autonomy" for Crimean Tatars using "political and legal" means. The meeting was attended by the Head of the [[Republic of Tatarstan]] and the chair of the [[Russian Council of Muftis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/29/us-ukraine-crisis-crimea-tatars-idUSBREA2S09320140329|title=Crimean Tatars' want autonomy after Russia's seizure of peninsula|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decisions as to whether the Tatars will accept Russian passports or whether the autonomy sought would be within the Russian or Ukrainian state have been deferred pending further discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skynews.com.au/world/article.aspx?id=962589|title=World|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During occupation of Crimea by Russian Federation, Crimean Tatars are reportedly persecuted and driscriminated by Russian authorities, including cases of [[torture]], [[arbitrary detention]]s, [[forced disappearance]]s by Russian [[security forces]] and courts.&lt;ref name="urlCrimea: Persecution of Crimean Tatars Intensifies | Human Rights Watch"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/14/crimea-persecution-crimean-tatars-intensifies |title=Crimea: Persecution of Crimean Tatars Intensifies &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlUN documents torture and arrests of Crimean Tatars by Russia - 12.12.2017 14:44 — Ukrinform News"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-society/2362880-un-documents-torture-and-arrests-of-crimean-tatars-by-russia.html |title=UN documents torture and arrests of Crimean Tatars by Russia - 12.12.2017 14:44 — Ukrinform News |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-ukraine-crimea-putin-human-rights-abuses-un-accusations-claims-a7421406.html|title=UN accuses Russia of multiple human rights abuses|date=2016-11-16|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-06-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12 2018, Ukraine lodged a [[memorandum]] consisting of 17,500 pages of text in 29 volumes to the UN's [[International Court of Justice]] about [[racial discrimination]] against Crimean Tatars by Russian authorities in occupied Crimea and state financing of terrorism by Russian Federation in [[Donbass]].&lt;ref name="urlUAWire - Ukraine files memorandum with UN Court of Justice containing evidence of Russias involvement in financing of terrorism"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://uawire.org/ukraine-files-memorandum-with-un-court-containing-evidence-of-russia-involvement-in-financing-terrorism |title=UAWire - Ukraine files memorandum with UN Court of Justice containing evidence of Russia's involvement in 'financing of terrorism' |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlUkraine submits to ICJ evidence of Russian crimes in Crimea, Donbas | UNIAN"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unian.info/politics/10149827-ukraine-submits-to-icj-evidence-of-russian-crimes-in-crimea-donbas.html |title=Ukraine submits to ICJ evidence of Russian crimes in Crimea, Donbas &amp;#124; UNIAN |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7762">'''Development studies''' is an interdisciplinary branch of [[social science]]. Development studies is offered as a specialized master's degree in a number of universities, and, less commonly, as an undergraduate degree. It has grown in popularity as a subject of study since the early 1990s, and has been most widely taught and researched in the [[third world]] and in countries with a colonial history, such as the [[UK]], where development studies originated.&lt;ref&gt;Kothari, U. (ed), ''A Radical History of Development Studies: Individuals, Institutions and Ideologies'' – but see ''The Journal of Peasant Studies'' 34/1 (2007) for an alternative view.&lt;/ref&gt; Students of development studies often choose careers in international organisations such as the [[United Nations]], [[World Bank]], [[non-governmental organisations]] (NGOs), private sector development consultancy firms, [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) bodies and research centers.

==Professional bodies==

Throughout the world, a number of professional bodies for development studies have been founded:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iccda.net/about.html About ICCDA]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Europe]]: European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (EADI)
* [[Latin America]]: Consejo Latinoamericano de Ciencias Sociales (CLACSO)
* [[Asia]]: Asian Political and International Studies Association (APISA)
* [[Africa]]: Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA) and  Organization for Social Science Research in Eastern and Southern Africa (OSSREA)
* [[Arabic world]]: Arab Institutes and Centers for Economic and Social Development Research (AICARDES)

The common umbrella organisation of these association is the Inter-regional Coordinating Committee of Development Associations (ICCDA). In the [[UK]] and [[Ireland]], the [[Development Studies Association]] is a major source of information for research on and studying in development studies. Its mission is to connect and promote those working on development research.

==History==
The emergence of development studies as an academic discipline in the second half of the twentieth century is in large part due to increasing concern about economic prospects for the [[third world]] after [[decolonisation]]. In the immediate post-war period, [[development economics]], a branch of [[economics]], arose out of previous studies in colonial economics. By the 1960s, an increasing number of development economists felt that economics alone could not fully address issues such as political effectiveness and educational provision.&lt;ref&gt;Kothari, U. (ed), ''A Radical History of Development Studies: Individuals, Institutions and Ideologies''&lt;/ref&gt; Development studies arose as a result of this, initially aiming to integrate ideas of [[politics]] and economics. Since then, it has become an increasingly inter- and multi-disciplinary subject, encompassing [[Development studies#Disciplines of development studies|a variety of social scientific fields]].&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Lewis F. (2003) ''Theories of Industrial Modernization and Enterprise Development: A Review''. ISR/Google Books, Second revised edition {{ISBN|978-0-906321-26-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years the use of political economy analysis- the application of the analytical techniques of economics- to try and assess and explain political and social factors that either enhance or limit development has become increasingly widespread as a way of explaining the success or failure of reform processes. The era of modern development is commonly deemed to have commenced with the [[Harry S. Truman's 1949 inaugural address|inauguration speech]] of [[Harry S. Truman]] in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Rist, G., ''The History of Development: From Western Origins to Global Faith''&lt;/ref&gt;  In Point Four of his speech, with reference to Latin America and other poor nations, he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;More than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching misery. Their food is inadequate. They are victims of disease. Their economic life is primitive and stagnant. Their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas. For the first time in history, humanity possesses the knowledge and the skill to relieve the suffering of these people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inaugural.senate.gov/swearing-in/address/address-by-harry-s-truman-1949|title=Address by Harry S. Truman, 1949|last=|first=|date=|website=Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But development studies has since also taken an interest in lessons of past development experiences of Western countries. More recently, the emergency of [[human security]] – a new, people-oriented approach to understanding and addressing global security threats – has led to a growing precognitions of a relationship between security and development. Humans security argues that inequalities and insecurity in one state or region have consequences for global security and that it is thus in the interest of all states to address underlying development issues. This relationship with studies of human security is but one example of the interdisciplinary nature of development studies.

'''Elizabeth Montagu''' (2 October 1718 – 25 August 1800) was a British social reformer, patron of the arts, [[salonist]], literary critic, and writer who helped organize and lead the [[Blue Stockings Society]]. Her parents were both from wealthy families with strong ties to the British peerage and intellectual life. She was sister to [[Sarah Scott]], author of ''A Description of Millenium &lt;!-- sic --&gt;Hall and the Country Adjacent''. She married [[Edward Montagu (1692–1775)|Edward Montagu]], a man with extensive holdings, to become one of the richer women of her era. She devoted this fortune to fostering English and [[Scottish literature]] and to the relief of the poor.

==Early life==
[[File:A Conversation of Virtuosis...at the Kings Arms by Gawen Hamilton.jpg|thumb|left|Mrs Montagu's father, Robinson, is in the centre of this group portrait of ''Virtuosis'' by [[Gawen Hamilton]].]]

She was born in [[Yorkshire]] to Matthew Robinson (1694–1778), of [[West Layton]] and Edgeley in Yorkshire, and Elizabeth daughter of Robert Drake, of Cambridge, by his wife Sarah Morris, daughter of Thomas Morris of Mount Morris, [[Monks Horton]]. Elizabeth was the eldest of their three daughters. [[Conyers Middleton]], the prominent [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] don, was the second husband of her Drake grandmother Sarah Morris.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb |id=19014 |title=Montagu, Elizabeth |first=Barbara Brandon |last=Schnorrenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1720 and 1736 the family owned part of what is now National Trust property, Treasurer's House, in York.  Elizabeth and her sister Sarah, the future novelist [[Sarah Scott]], spent time as children on extended stays with Dr Middleton, as both parents were somewhat aloof. The two girls learned [[Latin]], French, and Italian and studied literature. As a child, Elizabeth and Sarah, in particular, were very close, but grew apart after Sarah became sick with smallpox.

While young, Elizabeth became a friend of [[Lady Margaret Harley]], later the Duchess of Portland, the only surviving child of [[Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]]. Lady Margaret and Elizabeth corresponded weekly when apart and were inseparable when together. She spent time with Lady Margaret in London and met many of the celebrated figures of the 1730s, including the poet [[Edward Young]] and the religious thinker [[Gilbert West]]. In Lady Margaret's household, men and women spoke as equals and engaged in witty, learned banter. Mrs. Montagu later used this model of intellectual discourse in her salons. Visits to Lady Margaret became more important to Elizabeth when her mother inherited a country seat in [[Kent]] and made that her home, with the daughters.

==Marriage to Montagu==
[[File:Elizabeth Montagu, as Anne Boleyn, by Christian Friedrich Zincke, in a friendship box, miniature, circa 1740.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth Montagu, as [[Anne Boleyn]], black and white reproduction of a miniature by [[Christian Friedrich Zincke]], in a friendship box, circa 1740.]]

In 1738, Montagu wrote to Harley explaining that she had no desire for men or marriage. She saw marriage as a rational and expedient convention and did not suppose it possible to love a man. In 1742 she married [[Edward Montagu (1692–1775)|Edward Montagu]], grandson of the [[Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich]], who owned numerous coal mines and had several rents and estates in [[Northumberland]]. She was twenty-two and he was fifty years old. The marriage was advantageous, but it was apparently not very passionate. All the same, she bore a son, John, the next year, and she loved her child immensely. When he died unexpectedly in 1744, she was devastated. She and Edward remained friendly throughout their remaining time together, but there were no more children or pregnancies. Prior to the loss of her son, she had not been very religious, but his death brought her to consider religion more and more. Meanwhile, her sister, Sarah Scott, was growing increasingly devout.

Elizabeth kept a female companion with her most of the time. This person was not exactly a servant, but she would act in that role. She would be expected to carry things and aid Elizabeth on her daily round. Barbara Schnorrenberg suggests that [[Sarah Scott]] was in this function and says that there is good reason to suggest that she married poorly to escape that situation (Schnorrenberg 723). After Elizabeth's mother died, her father moved to London with his housekeeper/possibly mistress, giving no money at all to his children. When Sarah was removed from her bad marriage, Elizabeth's father (whose ward she was) not only gave her no financial help but forbade either Elizabeth or [[Matthew Robinson, 2nd Baron Rokeby|Matthew]], her brother, from relieving her distress.

Beginning in 1750, she and Edward established a routine where they would winter in London in [[Mayfair]] and then, in the spring, go to [[Sandleford]] in Berkshire, which had been his since 1730. He would then go on to Northumberland and [[Yorkshire]] to manage his holdings, while she would occasionally accompany him to the family manor-house at East Denton Hall, a clean-lined mansion of 1622 on the West Road in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].

She was a shrewd businesswoman, despite affecting to patronise Northumbrian society for its practical conversation. Though acting as Lady Bountiful to her miners and their families, she was pleased at how cheap this could be. She was also glad to note that: "Our pitmen are afraid of being turned off and that fear keeps an order and regularity amongst them that is very uncommon." Elizabeth enjoyed hearing the miners singing in the pit, but found, alas, that their dialect was "dreadful to the auditors' nerves."

[[Horace Walpole]] wrote to George Montagu in 1768: 'Our best sun is Newcastle coal.'

==Salon and cultural life==
[[File:Elizabeth Montagu &amp; Anna Laetitia Barbauld, engraved by or after Thomas Holloway, published by T. Wright, Essex street, Strand, 1 July 1776, 6.25 x 4 inches.jpg|thumb|left|Elizabeth Montagu &amp; [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld]], engraving after [[Thomas Holloway (painter)|Thomas Holloway]], published by T. Wright, Essex street, Strand, 1 July 1776, 6.25 x 4 inches.]]

In London, Elizabeth began to be a celebrated hostess. She organized literary breakfasts with Gilbert West, [[George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton|George Lyttelton]], and others. By 1760, these had turned to evening entertainments with large assemblies. Card playing and strong drink were forbidden from these convocations, which were now known as [[Blue Stockings Society (England)|blue stocking]] events.

By 1770, her home on Hill Street had become the premiere [[salon (gathering)|salon]] in London. [[Samuel Johnson]], [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], [[Edmund Burke]], [[David Garrick]], and [[Horace Walpole]] were all in the circle. For writers, being introduced there meant patronage, and Montagu patronized a number of authors, including [[Elizabeth Carter]], [[Hannah More]], [[Frances Burney]], [[Anna Barbauld]], [[Sarah Fielding]], [[Hester Chapone]], [[James Beattie (writer)|James Beattie]], and [[Anna Williams (poet)|Anna Williams]]. Samuel Johnson's hostess, [[Hester Thrale]], was also an occasional visitor to Hill Street. Among her persistent admirers was the physician [[Messenger Monsey]]. Among the blue stockings, Elizabeth Montagu was not the dominant personality, but she was the woman of greatest means, and it was her house, purse, and power that made the society possible. As a literary critic, she was a fan of [[Samuel Richardson]], both Fieldings ([[Henry Fielding]] and [[Sarah Fielding]]), and Fanny Burney, and she was pleased to discover that [[Laurence Sterne]] was a distant relation. She was related to Laurence Sterne through the Botham family. Sterne entrusted her with the disposition of his papers upon his departure for France. He was in ill health and the prospect of his dying abroad was real. She was a supporter of [[Thomas Percy (Bishop of Dromore)|Bishop Percy's]] ''Reliques of Ancient English Poetry.''

She also held similar events at her residence in the centre house (#16) of the [[Royal Crescent]], Bath.&lt;ref name="lowndes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lowndes |first=William |title=The Royal Crescent in Bath |publisher=Redcliffe Press |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-905459-34-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bluestocking work and writing==
[[File:Portraits in the Characters of the Muses in the Temple of Apollo by Richard Samuel.jpg|thumb|left|''Portraits in the Characters of the Muses in the Temple of Apollo'', 1778, 52 x 61 inches, by [[Richard Samuel]]. The sitters are: [[Anna Letitia Barbauld]] (1743–1825), poet and writer; [[Elizabeth Carter]] (1717–1806), scholar and writer; [[Elizabeth Griffith]] (1727–1793), playwright and novelist; [[Angelica Kauffmann]] (1741–1807), painter; [[Charlotte Lennox]] (1720–1804), writer; [[Catharine Macaulay]] (1731–1791), historian and political polemicist; Elizabeth Montagu; [[Hannah More]] (1745–1833), religious writer; [[Elizabeth Ann Sheridan]] (née Linley).]]

Elizabeth was a [[bluestocking]]. Called the "Queen of the Blues", Elizabeth Montagu led and hosted the [[Blue Stockings Society]] of England from about 1750. It was a loose organization of privileged women with an interest in education, but it waned in popularity at the end of the 18th century. It gathered to discuss literature, and also invited educated men to participate. Talk of politics was prohibited; literature and the arts were the main subjects. Many of the bluestocking women supported each other in intellectual endeavors such as reading, art work, and writing. Many also published literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tinker, Chauncey Brewster |title=The salon and English letters: chapters on the interrelations of literature and society in the age of Johnson |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYU6AAAAMAAJ |year=1915 |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth Montagu published two works in her lifetime. George Lyttleton in 1760 encouraged Elizabeth to write ''Dialogues of the Dead'', and she contributed three sections to the work anonymously. (Her authorship is testified elsewhere.) It consists of a series of conversations between the living and the illustrious dead, and works as a satire of 18th century vanity and manners. In 1769, she published ''An Essay on the Writings and Genius of Shakespear''. In it, she proclaims Shakespeare to be the greatest English poet, and in fact the greatest poet of any nation. She also attacks Samuel Johnson's ''Preface to Shakespeare'' from 1765 for not having gone on to praise Shakespeare's plays enough. While Johnson had dealt with text, history, and the circumstances of editing, Montagu wrote instead about the characters, plots, and beauties of the verse in Shakespeare and saw in him a championing of all things inherently English. When the book was initially published anonymously, it was thought to be by [[Joseph Warton]], but by 1777 her name appeared on the title page. Johnson, for his part, was estranged from Montagu at this point.

In the late 1760s, Edward Montagu fell ill, and Elizabeth took care of him, although she resented giving up her freedom. He died in 1775. In 1776, she adopted her nephew, the orphan of her brother. Matthew Robinson, the child, kept his family name, but he was named Elizabeth's heir. At that point, the coal and landholdings Montagu passed on to Elizabeth accounted for an income of £7,000 a year. She managed her wealth and estates well, and by her death her coal income was worth 10,000 pounds a year.

[[File:Elizabeth Montagu by Wilson Lowry (1762-1824) engraving published April 1787.jpg|thumb|left|Mrs. Montagu by [[Wilson Lowry]] (1762–1824) engraving published London, April 1787]]

In 1777, she began work on [[Montagu House, Portman Square|Montagu House]] in [[Portman Square]] in London, moving in &lt;!-- not a mistake--&gt;in 1781, on land leased for 99 years. She also expanded [[Sandleford|Sandleford Priory]] in the 1780s, and had [[Capability Brown]] design its garden and alter the park. She died in Montagu House in London on 25 August 1800 and left [[Sandleford]] and all of her money to [[Matthew Montagu, 4th Baron Rokeby|Matthew Robinson]], her nephew.

==Works==
[[File:Houghton MS Hyde 7 (15) - Montagu, p 1.jpg|thumb|First page of a draft manuscript of ''An Essay on the Writings and Genius of Shakespear'', 1769]]

Elizabeth Montagu is author of two works published in her lifetime: three sections in George Lyttleton's ''Dialogues of the Dead'' (1760) and ''An Essay on the Writings and Genius of Shakespeare'' (1769). In addition, two collections of Montagu's letter were published posthumously.

''Dialogues of the Dead'' was a series of critiques about eighteenth century society. In Dialogue 26, Montagu uses [[Hercules]] to engage in a discussion of [[virtue]]. In Dialogue 27, a character, Mrs. Mopish, cannot go the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]] because she is endlessly distracted by worldly influences. In Dialogue 28, a bookseller explains to [[Plutarch]] the difficulties of publishing in modern society.

''An Essay on the Writings and Genius of Shakespeare'' defends [[Shakespeare]] against criticism by supporters of the French style of drama, particularly against the attacks of [[Voltaire]]. In ''Essay'' Montagu claims Shakespeare's success comes from his overall [[virtue]] and ability to engaging the audiences' emotion, not from strict adherence to the classical models of drama.

==Letters==
Montagu was a copious writer of familial letters to her coterie and beyond. Her letters include discussions of health, domestic arraignments, travel plans, and reports of social events. About one-third of her correspondence focused on culture such as theater, opera, public spectacles, moral philosophy, and divinity.&lt;ref name=Eger&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eger |first1=Elizabeth |title=Bluestockings: Women of Reason from Enlightenment to Romanticism |date=2010 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Basingstoke, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these topics, history was discussed more than twice as much as any other topic.&lt;ref name=Eger /&gt;

Her most frequent correspondence on literature was with her sister, [[Sarah Scott]], followed by her friends, [[Elizabeth Carter]] and [[Gilbert West]].&lt;ref name=Eger /&gt; She and Scott were both avid readers of published letters throughout their lives, reading collections by [[Alexander Pope|Pope]] and [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]].&lt;ref name=Berg&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berg |first1=Temma |title=Women, Gender, and Print Culture in Eighteenth-Century Britain: Essays in Memory of Betty Rizzo. |date=2013 |publisher=Lehigh U P |location=Lanham}}&lt;/ref&gt; This influenced the women's own letter writing. Their frequency of correspondence waxed and waned over the years depending on the circumstances of their lives;&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hill |first1=Bridget |title=A Tale Of Two Sisters: The Contrasting Careers And Ambitions Of Elizabeth Montagu And Sarah Scott. |journal=[[Women's History Review]] |date=2010 |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=215–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montagu is recorded to have written Scott more frequently.&lt;ref name=Eger /&gt;

Similarly, Montagu is noted to have sent more letters to [[Elizabeth Carter]] than to have received them.&lt;ref name=Eger /&gt; Montagu was an ardent supporter of Carter despite her friend being of a lower class; Montagu respected Carter's skill and virtue. Montague felt comfortable enough to correspond with Carter about the responsibility of great wealth.&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite book |last1=Myers |first1=Sylvia Harcstark |title=The Bluestocking Circle: Women, Friendship, and the Life of the Mind in Eighteenth-Century England |date=1990 |publisher=Claredon |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gilbert West]] influenced Montagu's thinking about religion, history, and literature. He also affected her style of writing for a time. Based on his example, she began writing in a more formal syntax, but she eventually became irritated with the restrictions and reverted to her freer, more natural style.&lt;ref name="Myers"/&gt;

Montagu corresponded with [[George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton|George Lyttelton]] frequently about literature and history, a relationship which would later lead to Lyttleton including three of her works in his ''Dialogues of the Dead''. Their letters were known to have markedly different tones: hers were serious and intellectual, his responses tended toward flirtatious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ellis |first1=Markman |title='An Author in Form': Women Writers, Print Publication, and Elizabeth Montagu's Dialogues of the Dead. |journal=ELH |date=2010 |volume=2 |issue=0 |pages=417–438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Montagu maintained a close relationship with the elder statesman, [[William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath|William Pulteney, Lord Bath]]. Their relationship was purely emotional but described as a "pseudo-courtship".&lt;ref name="Myers"/&gt;

[[Lady Margaret Harley]] was a lifelong friend of Montagu's. It was Lady Harley to whom Montagu vented her frustrations over the institution of marriage and her desire for a truly companionate marriage — if she must have one at all. Montagu also expressed to Lady Margaret that marriage should include financial incentive.&lt;ref name=Hill /&gt;

A collection of Montagu's letters were first published 1809 by her nephew and heir, [[Matthew Montagu, 4th Baron Rokeby|Matthew Montagu]], under the title, ''The Letters of Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu, with Some of the Letters of her Correspondents.'' The selection of letters reflect a concern for Montagu's moral reputation. Another edition of her letters was released in 1906 by Matthew's granddaughter, Emily J. Climenson, and her friend, Reginald Blunt. This revised collection expanded on Montagu's view of the social world including fashion, politics, and nobility.&lt;ref name=Eger /&gt;

'''Green Investment Group Limited (GIG)''' is a specialist in [[green infrastructure]] principal investment, project delivery and the management of portfolio assets, and related services.

The business was launched initially by the [[UK government]] in 2012 as the first institution of its type in the world. The organisation was acquired by the diversified financial group [[Macquarie Group|Macquarie Group Limited]] in 2017, creating one of Europe’s largest teams of dedicated green infrastructure investors, and now operates under the name Green Investment Group. It is structured as a [[public limited company]] and is owned by the [[Macquarie Group Limited |Macquarie Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macquarie.com/au/about/newsroom/2017/macquarie-led-consortium-to-acquire-the-green-investment-bank|title=Macquarie Group leads consortium to acquire the Green Investment Bank|website=www.macquarie.com|language=en|access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has offices in [[London]] and [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5E8E86QQ20120308 "UK to base Green Investment Bank in Edinburgh, London"] Reuters, 8 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
As a result of the [[Climate Change Act 2008]], the United Kingdom became legally committed to significantly reducing its [[carbon emissions]] by 2050. More importantly, the Act committed the UK to generating a significantly higher percentage of its energy from [[renewable energy|renewable sources]] by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/government-figures-show-britain-will-fail-to-meet-its-kyoto-obligations-466910.html "Government figures show Britain will fail to meet its Kyoto obligations"] ''The Independent'', 18 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A non-partisan, [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] committee on [[climate change]] was established to study and recommend ways of meeting the country's obligations. The committee reported that for a new, low-carbon business and government infrastructure to be established, the necessary investment would range between £200&amp;nbsp;billion and £1&amp;nbsp;trillion over the next two decades.&lt;ref name=comm&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmenvaud/505/505.pdf Green Investment Bank], Environmental Audit Committee, House of Commons, UK, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee further stated that since traditional sources of capital for investment in green infrastructure could not provide even half that amount by 2025, there would be a funding gap that needed to be covered by the state budget.&lt;ref name=comm /&gt;

In 2009, two reports were published advocating the creation of a state-backed infrastructure bank to provide financing to green projects. The first, entitled "Accelerating Green Infrastructure Financing: Outline proposals for UK green bonds and infrastructure bank" was published in March 2009 by [[Climate Change Capital]] and [[E3G]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climatechangecapital.com/media/2153/Accelerating%20Green%20Infrastructure%20Financing%20Final%2021-05-09.pdf "Accelerating Green Infrastructure Financing: Outline proposals for UK green bonds and infrastructure bank"], Climate Change Capital, UK, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The second, entitled "Delivering a 21st Century Infrastructure for Britain" was published by [[Policy Exchange]] in September 2009 and was written by [[Dieter Helm]], James Wardlaw and [[Ben Caldecott]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/publications/category/item/delivering-a-21st-century-infrastructure-for-britain "Delivering a 21st Century Infrastructure for Britain"], Policy Exchange, UK, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; These proposals were then contained in the manifestos of each of the main political parties for the 2010 UK General Election.

The [[Fiscal year]] 2010 [[March 2010 United Kingdom budget|British government budget]] contained the first mention of a "green investment bank" scheme, earmarked with £2&amp;nbsp;billion. Chancellor [[Alistair Darling]] stated that the [[Labour party (UK)|Labour]] government was committed "to support offshore wind energy" and other forms of alternative energy, which he also billed as "crucial to guiding the country out of [[recession]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/mar/24/budget-green-investment-bank "Budget 2010: Chancellor announces green investment bank"] ''The Guardian'', 24 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], the newly formed [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition]] government defined its primary economic objective to be the drastic reduction of Britain's debt and yearly deficits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.net/2010/05/13/british-coalition-stresses-need-for-cuts/ "British coalition stresses need for cuts"] EuroNews, 13 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the government sought to create a financing scheme for the environmental investment needs of the country that would be funded mainly by the private sector, including the banks.

In June 2010 the Green Investment Bank Commission, established by George Osborne in opposition, after holding hearings recommended that the government created an eponymous banking entity within the year.&lt;ref name=comm /&gt; Chancellor [[George Osborne]] remained sceptical after objections to the creation of such a bank were raised by the Treasury, since a Green Investment Bank would "swell the state deficit" as it would appear as a liability on the government's balance sheet.&lt;ref name=guard&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/11/greeen-investment-bank?CMP=twt_fd "Green investment bank 'must operate commercially'"] ''The Guardian'', 11 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK government's [[Spending Review]] of October 2010 that announced a raft of austerity measures to deal with the UK government deficit, also included an announcement about the creation of a Green Investment Bank. The government expected to obtain by early 2013 the European Commission's approval for state aid to the Bank, with investment in green projects estimated to begin by April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/speeches/vince-cable-resource-security-2011 "Resource security"], Speech by Vince Cable, BIS Secretary, 12 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
The plans for the environmental funding scheme were endorsed by [[Greenpeace]], whose executive director urged the prime minister to "get personally involved", as well as by a number of similar organisations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transformuk.org/en/articles/9/letter-to-editor-of-guardian/ Letter to the editor] of ''The Guardian'', 1 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Transform UK]], whose director stated that "the only cost the Treasury should consider is the cost of failure to unleash this institution's massive potential to re-power our economy."&lt;ref name=guard /&gt; Environmentalists engaged in public demonstrations demanding a quicker implementation of the plans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/19/greenpeace-treasury-green-investment-bank "Greenpeace activists scale Treasury building in green bank protest"]''The Guardian'', 19 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

However, non-government organisations and environmentalists criticised the scheme because it lacked ambition. The [[World Development Movement]] disputed that such a small scheme will attract the kind of investment needed to "generate green jobs, green industry and a green economy in the UK".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wdm.org.uk/press-release/spending-review-reaction-lessons-should-be-learnt-developing-world Press release] WDM, 20 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; An economic study commissioned by WDM and Platform recommended that, instead of creating a new "banking scheme", the government should "transform the [already] {{Sic|hide=y|publicly|-}}owned [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] into a powerful green investment bank", in the process also "creating 50,000 green jobs".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wdm.org.uk/sites/default/files/A%20Bank%20for%20the%20Future.pdf "Bank for the future"] by [[James Leaton]], with additional research by Howard Reed, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, a former adviser to the government, [[Jonathon Porritt]], who had been head of the [[Sustainable Development Commission]], publicly criticised the Coalition's scrapping of a planned rise in aviation tax, its watering down of schemes that promote small-scale renewable electricity and its failure to promote a "green investment bank" with immediate borrowing powers. Mr Porritt claimed he examined 75 policies on which the government had committed itself, finding little or no progress in 55. The government responded that it remains "committed to the environment", but claimed that the economic recession had affected environmental policies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13312901 "PM's pledge of greenest government 'vanishingly remote'"] BBC News, 7 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The leader of the [[Green Party of England and Wales]] (and [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Brighton Pavilion (UK Parliament constituency)|Brighton Pavilion]]) [[Caroline Lucas]], criticised the nomenclature of the GIB in January 2011, when she wrote that "It's a bit rich to call [the GIB] a green investment bank if it can neither borrow nor lend". Lucas argued that without these powers, "it would be a fund – that is, a pot of money that, once used up, is gone forever.".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/jan/27/green-investment-bank "The green investment bank: neither particularly green, nor a bank"] The Guardian, 27 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism also centred on the location of the institution. Bloomberg claimed that "Most of the 50- 70 jobs will initially be in London..."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-08/u-k-green-bank-will-have-base-in-edinburgh-jobs-in-london.html "Green Bank Will Have Base in Edinburgh, Jobs in London"] Bloomberg, 8 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and some questioned that the decision to locate many jobs in London, despite the announcement headline of Edinburgh being chosen as winner of the location contest, pointed to a "bid to defuse Scottish independence... a blatant move to unite the capitals over Alex Salmond's key policy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9131757/Green-Investment-Bank-bid-to-defuse-Scottish-independence.html "Green Investment Bank bid to defuse Scottish independence"] The Telegraph, 8 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation===
On 23 May 2011, Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg]] at a speech at Climate Change Capital stated that the Green Investment Bank "will begin operating in April 2012", adding that the bank's early targets would be "offshore wind, waste and non-domestic energy efficiency".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13502121 "Clegg: UK green bank 'to begin investing in April 2012'"] BBC News, 23 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Clegg added that legislation would "ensure the independence of the institution."

On 24 May 2011, [[Business Secretary]] [[Vince Cable]], in addressing the parliament, stated that the bank will become "a key component" of the transition to a "low-carbon economy", which will need "significant investment over the coming decades." Cable also stated that the GIB will have an initial capitalisation of £3&amp;nbsp;billion, which "the Government believes will leverage a further £15&amp;nbsp;billion of private investment".&lt;ref name=eneff&gt;[http://www.energyefficiencynews.com/i/4124/ "UK Business Secretary sets out future of Green Investment Bank as ‘enduring institution’"] ''Energy Efficiency News'', 25 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The same day, BIS, in a press release&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/business-sectors/low-carbon-business-opportunities/gib/detail Press release] BIS, 25 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; containing answers to "frequently asked questions" about the bank, outlined the planned finances of the GIB and its activation in "three phases":
*'''Incubation''' (April 2012 until state aid approval): Government makes direct financial investments in the "green economy".
*'''Establishment''' (following state aid approval): UK Green Investment Bank established as a "stand-alone institution".
*'''Full borrowing powers''' (ca. 2015–16): Bank given powers to borrow, "subject to public sector's net-debt falling as a percentage of GDP".

Dr Cable unveiled on the same day his department's [[Strategic planning|statement of vision]] for the bank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/u/11-917-update-design-green-investment-bank.pdf "Update on the design of the Green Investment Bank"] BIS, May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The document was cautiously&lt;ref&gt;"While different investor groups can be comfortable with different elements of risk profiles, the number of investors willing to take the set of required risks may be limited by lack of information and experience and the application of risk-averse rules of thumb." ''[http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/u/11-917-update-design-green-investment-bank.pdf Update]'', p.14&lt;/ref&gt; positive about the prospects of private investment in the environment, in the UK.

BIS appeared to indicate on 12 December 2011 that the 'Incubation' phase had progressed, with the announcement of a new team within the department: ''UK Green Investments'' (UKGI). It stated the team's role was to "drive investment in the UK’s green infrastructure until the Green Investment Bank is formally established".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nds.coi.gov.uk/content/detail.aspx?NewsAreaId=2&amp;ReleaseID=422445 GIB moves a step closer] Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the UKGI team consisted of six members: five men and one woman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/business-sectors/low-carbon-business-opportunities/uk-green-investments/team The UKGI Team] Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

State aid approval for the bank was granted by the [[EU Commission]] on 17 October 2012, allowing the bank to become fully established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bis.gov.uk/Press-Releases/UK-Green-Investment-Bank-gets-green-light-from-Europe-681c7.aspx "UK Green Investment Bank gets green light from Europe"] Department for Business, Innovation and Skills&lt;/ref&gt; The bank was subsequently formally launched in Edinburgh by Vince Cable on 28 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-20522615 "Cable launches UK's 'Green Bank'"] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
On 25 May 2011, Vince Cable informed the House of Commons that BIS would appoint [[Adrian Montague|Sir Adrian Montague]], [[CBE]], chairman of private equity firm [[3i]], to lead a team of "independent financial experts" in setting up the UK Green Investment Bank before it started work the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8534109/Nuclear-boss-Sir-Adrian-Montague-to-head-Green-bank.html "Nuclear boss Sir Adrian Montague to head Green bank"], ''Telegraph'', 25 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Cable stated that the bank would be initially staffed by up to 100 people tasked with "financing the Coalition's plans for a low-carbon economy".

On 25 May 2012, [[Baron Smith of Kelvin|Lord Smith of Kelvin]] was announced as the first Chair of the bank by Vince Cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-18207982|title=Lord Smith to chair Green Investment Bank|author=|date=25 May 2012|work=BBC News|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaun Kingsbury was the bank's chief executive from October 2012 to 2017.

==Part–privatisation==
In June 2015 the Business Secretary [[Sajid Javid]] put forward proposals to part-[[Privatization|privatise]] the bank, with the stated aim of giving it full access to the [[capital market]]s.&lt;ref name=POGIB&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=19 December 2015 |title=Privatisation of Green Investment Bank could 'damage its reputation' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35138659 |newspaper=BBC News |location=UK |access-date=19 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final privatisation==
On 18 August 2017, the bank was sold to [[Macquarie Group|Macquarie Group Limited]] for £2.3&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK government’s sale of Green Investment Bank completed|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-governments-sale-of-green-investment-bank-completed|publisher=GOV.UK|accessdate=26 November 2017|date=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Guey Heung Lee v. Johnson''''', 404 U.S. 1215 (1971), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case regarding the [[desegregation]] of schools in [[San Francisco]].

In 1971, the [[San Francisco Unified School District]] attempted to desegregate the school system by reassigning pupils attending segregated schools to other public schools. The School District submitted a comprehensive plan for desegregation which the [[United States district court|District Court]] approved.

{{quote box|quote=''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' was not written for blacks alone| source= —Guey Heung v. Johnson| width  = 25%| align  = left}}

Some Chinese parents protested the move, because in the Asian schools the students could learn about their cultural heritage, and they would lose this if they went to public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite_book |title=Encyclopedia of Minorities in American Politics: African Americans and Asian Americans |last=Schultz |first=Jeffrey  |authorlink= |year=2000 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=1-57356-148-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDV40aK1T-sC |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WDV40aK1T–sC&amp;pg=PA274 274] |accessdate=2009-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] entered a temporary [[Stay of proceedings|stay]] pending a hearing in the District Court. Four days later, however, the Court of Appeals vacated that stay ''[[sua sponte]]''. The District Court then denied the stay. Thereupon, a different three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals heard [[oral argument]] on the motions for a stay and denied those motions.

The Supreme Court too denied the stay, saying

The Hewa were one of the last peoples in Papua New Guinea to come into contact with the outside world. Many Hewa people north of the Lagaip River were uncontacted until 1975, when the Officer in Charge at Kopiago braved arrow attacks and led what probably was Papua New Guinea's last "first contact patrol", bringing steel axeheads to an area where stone axeheads were the norm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://exkiap.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=1041&amp;view=previous OIC Kopiago post 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://exkiap.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=1184&amp;view=next OIC Kopiago post 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Even south of the Lagaip, many Hewa families were first contacted by Steadman in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="Steadman, op. cit."&gt;Steadman, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the typical family (which averaged seven people) lived in relative isolation from other families, with their nearest neighbors living half a mile away through dense jungle.&lt;ref name="Steadman, op. cit."/&gt; After darkness envelops their isolated realm, the families often stay awake for hours, the men telling myths and stories around a fire, and the women, gathered around a separate fire in their section of the house, often interrupting with well-timed quips and jests.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Schwartz, ''A World of Villages'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=o_R_AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Bamiah+or+Borobuan+would+tell+a+story%22&amp;dq=%22Bamiah+or+Borobuan+would+tell+a+story%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qbYtU_PPEvPO2QXY8IDgCA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA page 54-5]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, historical tales are sung or chanted.&lt;ref&gt;''Sung Tales from the Papua New Guinea highlands'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=DR7ZPcwRf-AC&amp;pg=PA321&amp;dq=%22Hewa+language%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AygvU_PxHYGO2AXq54HYDg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hewa&amp;f=false page 29]&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades, change has come to the region.

The '''Holoholo people''' (also ''Horohoro'' or ''Kalanga'') are an ethnic group that live around [[Kalemie]] city on [[Lake Tanganyika]] in the present-day [[Tanganyika Province]] of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and on the opposite shore of the lake in [[Tanzania]].

==Language==

As of 2002 there were about 15,500 speakers of the [[Holoholo language]].{{sfn|Holoholo A language...}}
The name "Holoholo" was given to them by the Belgians. It comes from the sound of their greeting, which outsiders found comical. The alternative name "Kalanga" simply means people who were there before the current population.{{sfn|Roberts|1991|p=193}}

==History==
[[File:Statuette Holoholo-Musée ethnologique de Berlin.jpg|thumb|Holoholo statuette of a woman from the 19th century or early 20th century]]
The Holoholo are a matrilineal people.{{sfn|Reefe|1981|p=124}}
They are descendants of [[Baguha people]] who fled from the [[Luba Empire]] when it was expanding eastward in the 18th century, settling around [[Kalemie]] where the [[Lukuga River]] leaves the lake.{{sfn|Holoholo Information}}
During the period of Luba dominance that followed the eastward expansion under Luba king [[Ilunga Sungu]] around 1800, ''bambudye'' secret societies were introduced among the Holoholo and other peoples, propagating oral traditions of the Luba royal family.
The Holoholo adopted and adapted the Luba genesis myth, in which they believed there was a mountain called Ilunga Sungu on the west side of the Lualaba towards the Luba heartland,
This refers to the location of the court of Ilunga Sungu at [[Katende]].{{sfn|Reefe|1981|p=127}}

The 1935 book ''Les peuplades du Congo belge'' shows the Holoholo living on both sides of the Lukuga.{{sfn|Roberts|1991|p=208}}
They became middlemen in the Arab and African slave trade. With suppression of this trade the economy collapsed and disease and local warfare decimated the population. Today the economy is mostly agricultural based on sorghum, maize, peanuts, and beans.
Fish are caught with nets, dried and sold locally, the main source of cash in the area. Sorghum is used to make beer.{{sfn|Holoholo Information}}

The Holoholo who live in Tanzania around Kungwe Mountain have a tradition that their ancestors came from the Congo side by means of a long island that continued Kungwe Mountain into the lake.
The lake level is highly variable, so it is conceivable that they crossed at a time when it was much lower than today, when part of the ridge separating the northern and southern basins of the lake would have been exposed.{{sfn|Clark|1969|pp=35-36}}

Thousands of Holo-holo had settled along the Tanganyikan side of the lake by 1915, having sailed over in canoes. A census in 1948 counted 4,410 Holo-holo in Tanganyika.{{sfn|Foden|2006|p=235}}

In 1987 the Holoholo people had an estimated population of 12,500 in Tanzania. They traditionally lived in the [[Mahale Mountains]]  on the east shore of the lake opposite Kalemie. However they were expelled from this area after 1979 to make way for the [[Mahale Mountains National Park]] created in 1985.{{sfn|Finke|2002|p=537}}

The '''Institute for Global Communications''' or '''IGC Internet''' was founded in 1987 and is an institution that provides web hosting service to environmental, peace, and social justice organizations. IGC is a project of the [[Tides Center]]. During the very early days of the Internet, IGC was responsible for training thousands of small progressive groups as to how to use email, mailing lists, discussion groups, gopher sites, and later web sites and other web services to further their mission. 

IGC formed an international link when started working with [[GreenNet]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. 

In 1990, in partnership with six international organizations, IGC co-founded the [[Association for Progressive Communications]] (APC).

At its peak in 1998, IGC had over 35 full-time staff members with offices in San Francisco, California, USA. 

Since then ConflictNet went out of existence and LaborNet left the IGC Networks. IGC still offers web hosting services to groups, individuals, and small companies.

'''Istro-Romanians / Istrorumeni''' ([[ethnonym]]: ''Rumeni'' and occasionally also ''Rumâri'' and ''Rumêri''), also called ''Ćiribirci'', ''[[Ćići]]'', and ''[[Vlachs of Croatia|Vlahi]]'' by the local population, and '''''Istro-Romanians''''' by linguists, are a small [[ethnic group]] living in small area of northeastern [[Istria]], in the village [[Žejane]] in eastern plateau of mountain [[Ćićarija]], and several villages in a region of former [[Lake Čepić]] west of Mt. [[Učka]].

The 2001 Croatian census lists only 48 [[Romanian language]] speakers in [[Istria County]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dzs.hr/hrv/censuses/Census2001/Popis/H01_03_10/H01_03_10.html Croatian 2001 census, detailed classification by nationality]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 Croatian census, Istria listed 49 [[Romanians]] and 6 [[Vlachs of Croatia|Vlachs]].&lt;ref name="Census 2011"/&gt;

The inhabitants of villages and hamlets speak the [[Čakavian dialect]] which it is believed originated in [[Dalmatia]]. However, there is no known record to show that the Istro-Romanians came from Dalmatia. That there are traces of Istro-Romanian words in the [[Cakavian]] Istrian vocabulary and vice versa indicate only that over the centuries the two neighboring linguistically different groups assimilated through daily social contact and intermarriages, as happens with other peoples and their languages throughout the world.

==History==
The first historical record of Romanians in the Istrian region purportedly dates back to 940 A.D. when scholarly Roman Emperor [[Constantine VII]] recorded in ''De Administrando Imperio''" that there were Latin-language speakers in this area who called themselves Romans but who did not come from Rome. A later historical record of Romanians in Istria (not necessarily the "[[Ćići]]", and possibly the "[[Morlachs|Morlacchi]]" i.e. [[Vlachs]]) dates back to 1329, when Serbian chronicles mention that a Vlach population was living in the area, although there was an earlier mention from the 12th century of a leader in Istria called ''Radul'' which may have been a Romanian name.

In his monumental book, ''Historia antica, e moderna sacra, e profana, della città di Trieste'', published in his native town of Trieste in 1698, Fra Ireneo della Croce (1625–1713) wrote:

{{quotation|"Un'altra memoria antica, degna d'osservatione non minore della già addotte Antichità Romane, osservo in alcuni Popoli addimandati comunemente Chichi habitanti nelle Opčine Trebče, e Gropada situate nel Territorio di Trieste, sopra il Monte cinque miglia distante dalla Città verso Greco: Et in molti altri Villaggi, aspettanti à Castel nuovo, nel Carso Giurisditione de gl'Illustrissimi Signori Conti Petazzi, quali, oltre l'Idioma I Sclavo comune à tutto il Carso, usano un proprio, e particolare consimile al Valacco, intracciato con diverse parole, e vocaboli Latini, come scorgesi dall'ingiunti, &amp; à bel Studio qui da me riferiti. Non deve meravigliarsi chi legge, fe questi Popoli, quali proffessano l'origine loro da Carni, e suoi discendenti, venuti dalla Toscana à fondare la Nostra antica Provincia de' Carni, habbiano sempre conservato l'uso antico della lingua Romana, ò Latina, idioma comune de' loro Antenati, come constumano hoggidì pure al sentire [335] di Gio:Lucio (a) i Popoli nella Valacchia: Valachi autem hedierni quicunque lingua Valacha loquuntur, se ipsos non dicunt Vlahos, aut Valachos, sed Romanos, &amp; à Romanis ortos gloriuntur; Romanaque lingua loqui prositentur, quiod sicut sermo ipsorum comprobat: ita mores quoque crum Italis quam Slavis similiores conveniunt, Che perciò anco i nostri Chichi, addimandansi nel proprio linguaggio Rumeri: Essendo sentimento del mentovato Lucio, (b) che l'uso della lingua latina, fiorì anticamente non solo nell'Italia, ma anco nella Dalmatia, nell'Illirico, &amp; altre parti: Lingua romana, sive Latina Dalmatas usos ad ann. 1200. VVilliemus Tyrius testatur. lib. 2. cap. 17."}}

He mentions a people who, "beside the Slavic idiom common for all the Karst area, speak also their own and particular language, which is similar to Wallachian and contains many different Latin words." He was referring to the language of the "Ćići", ''who call themselves in their language as Rumeri'', in his own time, were known to inhabit an extensive part of Istria up to Trieste and surrounding regions.

Some linguists believe that the Istro-Romanians migrated to their present location about 600 years ago from [[Transylvania]], after the [[Black Death]] depopulated [[Istria]], as was told to generations of Istro-Romanians who handed down this story from parent to child by word of mouth. Some loan words also suggest that before reaching Istria, the Istro-Romanians lived for a period of time in [[Dalmatia]] near the Cetina river, but this is mere speculation as the loan words could easily have come from other Slavic peoples who likewise emigrated to Istria. Such loan words also exist in Daco-Romanian, the official language of Romania. Moreover, in modern Serbia, there are some Daco-Romanian speakers ''(see [[Romanians of Serbia]])'', but the majority of the large population of Romanians there speak Aromunian (a.k.a. Macedo-Romanian), both being distinctly different languages from Istro-Romanian.

[[Image:Istrorumeni linguistic-map1 (2).png|thumb|Two main areas, village Šušnjevica and Žejane (encircled), inhabited by Istro-Romanians.]]
More importantly, the Transylvanian connection that is emphasized by linguists is alive in the memory of some of the Istrorumeni themselves who today distinguish themselves into two distinct groups - the ''Ćići'' surrounding the Mune and Žejane area in Ćićarija, and the ''Vlahi'' of the southern Šušnjevica region, this despite the fact that their language is identical except for a few local distinctions. Iosif Popovici entitled his book ''Dialectele române din Istria'' (Halle, 1909) - that is, "''The Dialects...''" not "''The Dialect...''" - indirectly suggesting there were several types of Istro-Romanian dialects in Istria.

Romanian linguists are divided in their opinions: Prof. Dr. Iosif Popovici (1876–1928), who had travelled extensively in Istria, endorsed the theory that the Istro-Romanians were natives of [[Ţara Moţilor]] (Western Transylvania) who had migrated into [[Istria]] sometimes during the [[Middle Ages]]. ("Dialectele române din Istria", I, Halle a.d.S., 1914, p.&amp;nbsp;122 and following). This opinion was shared by [[Ovid Densusianu]] (1873–1938) (a Romanian folklorist, philologist, and poet who introduced trends of European modernism into Romanian literature - thus not a linguistics authority - who stated that Istro-Romanians were not native to Istria (''Histoire de la langue roumaine'', I, p.&amp;nbsp;337): "''Un premier fait que nous devons mettre en evidence, c'est que l'istro-roumain n'a pu se développer à l'origine là où nous le trouvons aujourd'hui''".

The Serbian dialectologist and phonologist [[Pavle Ivić]] (1924–99), respected for his work toward the standardization of the Serbian language, speculated that at the beginning of the Middle Ages a sizable Roman population inhabited all of the [[Balkans]], but his interests focused on the areas contained within the former Yugoslavia, whereas history shows that the Latin language influence reached considerably beyond that region. Besides, the Roman population to which he referred may not relate solely to the Istro-Romanians who migrated to Istria, but also the Istriot (Istro-Romance) speakers of Istria, as well as the Vegliot language (now extinguished) that was spoken in the nearby island of Krk (Veglia). Both of these languages evolved separately from Istro-Romanian.

Regarding the Vegliot speakers, in the 15th century, a purportedly similar population of ''Rumeri'' from the near mainland, as noted by Frankopan (Frangipani) princes in their chronicles, settled in northernmost [[Krk]] (Veglia) island, villages Poljica and Dubašnica at actual Malinska. In the mid-19th century they were gradually assimilated, and only some of their toponyms and plant names persist; also their Paternoster, ''Cace nostru'', was noted there.

[[Image:Fata din Șușnievița.jpg|thumb|Woman from Šušnjevica, in 1906.]]
When Istria was part of the [[Austrian Empire]], the Istro-Rumanians were the majority of a small "comune" (Eng. community, county) near the [[Raša (river)|Arsa]] River and mainly within the Arsa valley, as shown in the 1910 Austrian census.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digilander.libero.it/arup/etno1910gr.jpg Ethnic map of Istria in 1910 (Istrorumanian area indicated in a small "pointed" area)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, after the union of Istria to Italy,  the Italian government designated the existing town of Susnieviza (changing its name to [[:it:Valdarsa|Valdarsa]]; today called [[Šušnjevica]]) for the Istro-Romanian community, and appointed [[:it:Andrea Glavina|Andrea Glavina]], an Istro-Romanian professor who had studied in Romania, as their leader. They obtained a school in the [[Istro-Romanian language]] in the town of Valdarsa and reached a population of 3,000 in 1942. The population of modern [[Šušnjevica]] is now reduced to around 200 inhabitants.

After World War II, most Istro-Romanians left their ancestral homes, as did the majority of inhabitants throughout the Istrian peninsula due to discrimination, violence and threats by the incoming Communist regime. A small number remained in Istria while others,the Giuliani-Dalmati Italians from the centuries old Venetian Republic rule, along with their Croat neighbors, emigrated to various countries of Europe, most notably Italy, the U.S.A., Canada, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Venezuela, Australia and other countries throughout the world (Istro-Romanians became adjusted to Italy, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Peru and Venezuela because of their [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin identity]]). Those who stayed under Yugoslav rule underwent [[forced assimilation]] as much as, if not more than, they had under the prior brief Italian rule of Fascist Italy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} The Italian writer and historian [[Giuseppe Lazzarini]] believes that there are more than 5,000 Istro-Romanian descendants in [[Istria]], even though the 1991 Census lists only 811 Istro-Romanians. As happened with past and recent changeovers in regimes which have disfavored this minority, most of them identify themselves with other ethnic groups instead of as Istro-Romanian. Lazzarini believes that the Istro-Romanians are the descendants of the Roman legionnaires (brought in by [[Augustus]] to eastern [[Istria]] to colonize the borders of [[Roman Empire]]) and Aromanian shepherds, who escaped the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] invasions and moved to a plague depopulated [[Istria]] in the 15th century. Other historians and linguists, however, disagree with this theory inasmuch as the Aromanian and Istro-Romanian languages are very different and entirely distinguishable from each other.

Also significant is that unlike most other Romanian speakers, who are [[Eastern Orthodox]], the Istro-Romanians were in the past and are today [[Roman Catholic]], another characteristic of these people which suggests a different migratory pattern and historical evolution, like their Croat neighbors. In 1998, August Kovačec, a Croatian linguist, (see references below) published a detailed monograph on Istro-Romanians, their population, culture, glossary, grammar which was reflective only of the acknowledged speakers in Istria during the years in which the language was politically discouraged, not of the majority of native speakers who left Istria after World War II. This monomgram and his other texts, while exhaustive, are not the primary or authoritative source. Before and since his writings, Romanian, Italian and even Dalmatian linguists have published their own atlases, dictionaries and vocabularies on this nearly extinguished, but obsolete, language.

'''Josep Torras i Bages''' ({{IPA-ca|ʒuˈzɛp ˈtorəs}}), born at [[Les Cabanyes]], [[Alt Penedès]], on 12 September 1846, died at [[Vic]], [[Osona]], on 7 February 1916, was a [[Catalonia|Catalan]] thinker, writer, and [[bishop]]. He was one of the main figures in the turn of the 20th century [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Catalan nationalism]].

==Biography==

===Torras and the Catalan traditions===
Josep Torras strongly criticized the [[Laïcité|secularism]] displayed by the "militant nationalism" of [[Enric Prat de la Riba]] (1870–1917). In 1892 he wrote ''La tradició catalana'', where he emphasized Conservative Nationalism and warned against the erosion of Christian values. Exalting rural life, the family, religion, and the love of [[Catalan language]], the land and the language took an almost mystical dimension in his point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u6WaAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Torras+i+Bages+rural+catalonia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4xtWJN8r2Z&amp;sig=VwnfgABn9Hy1VpHy-RxHkxRORUY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vtWOScCeHczPkAXEqNSyDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result|title=Double Talk: Bilingualism and the Politics of Ethnicity in Catalonia|last=Woolard|first=Kathryn Ann|date=1989|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804715027|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was convinced that the Catalan nation had to be Christian in order to establish itself as something enduring and meaningful in the future. His words ''"Catalunya serà cristiana o no serà"'' (Catalonia will be Christian or will not be) are engraved at the gate of [[Santa Maria de Montserrat]] abbey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coa.sagepub.com/cgi/pdf_extract/10/2-3/51 Josep M. Fradera, ''Rural Traditionalism and Conservative Nationalism in Catalonia  1865-1900''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709191840/http://coa.sagepub.com/cgi/pdf_extract/10/2-3/51 |date=2012-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Torras was very interested in the study of the [[seny]], a virtue often considered a [[Catalan symbols|Catalan cultural symbol]], and encouraged others, like [[Josep Abril i Virgili]] and Jaume Raventós, to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wgxlZFEckGEC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=Jaume+Ravent%C3%B3s+seny&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oxGmf9t2A0&amp;sig=nXSPNGIH21v0-7z1Eju1cbxjt7s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result Carta del Bisbe de Vic a Jaume Raventós en aplegar els volums titulats ''Proses de bon Seny'' (Letter to Jaume Raventós)] {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on good sense and wisdom, ''seny'' was perceived by Torras to originate in the traditional Catalan rural farm (''casa pairal'' or ''masia''). The life in the traditional non-urban setting with its frugality, hard work, and religious piety was the right ground for the development of the values and social norms embodied in the Catalan ''seny''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DiGiacomo|first=Susan M.|date=1987|title="La Caseta i l'Hortet": Rural Imagery in Catalan Urban Politics|jstor=3317655|journal=Anthropological Quarterly|volume=60|issue=4|pages=160–166|doi=10.2307/3317655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecclesiastical work===
[[File:Ilmo. y Rvmo. Doctor don José Torras y Bages.jpg|thumb|right|Doctor don José Torras y Bages.]]In 1882 Torras became counselor to bishop of Barcelona [[José María de Urquinaona y Vidot|J. M. Urquinaona]]. Specializing in conflict-solving among Catholics, he also was the censor of some newspapers that were compromised in certain inner troubles (''procesos canónicos'') of the Spanish Church at the time.

Years later, in 1888, Josep Torras, after analyzing the growing secularization of Spanish society, wrote the book ''El clero en la vida social moderna'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. In his work he wrote straightforwardly about the often [[integrist]] or reactionary position of the Catholic Church in [[Spain]], and sought to encourage the Spanish Catholic clergy to adapt to the spirit of the times and to focus on moderation and personal spiritual discipline, advice that went largely unheeded at the time.

Torras was promoted to become [[archbishop]] of [[Archdiocese of Burgos|Burgos]] in 1906 and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Valencia in Spain|Valencia]] in 1913, but he declined because he did not want to put a distance between himself and the mission he was committed to in the heart of Catalonia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canalsocial.net/GER/ficha_GER.asp?id=3166&amp;cat=biografiasuelta GER Torras i Bages - Biografia suelta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616091123/http://www.canalsocial.net/GER/ficha_GER.asp?id=3166&amp;cat=biografiasuelta |date=2008-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Even though most of his works have been published in compilations under the title ''Obres completes'', his abundant correspondence, crucial for the understanding of certain issues surrounding Catalan nationalism, remains for the most part unpublished.

{{distinguish|Lamba people (Zambia)}}
The '''Lambas''' are an ethnic and linguistic group of people living in the Kéran and Doufelgou Districts (''Préfecture'') of the [[Kara Region]] in Northern [[Togo]] and in the Atakora and Donga Departments of [[Bénin]], West Africa. The capital of the [[Kéran]] District is [[Kandé|Kanté]] and the capital of the [[Doufelgou]] District is [[Niamtougou]].

In Togo, the Lambas live the Center and West of the Kéran District; in the [[Togo Mountains]] on the Défalé Chain; in the Western reaches of Doufelgou District; in Eastern reaches of Doufelgou District North of the Binah River: and, in Niamtougou, in the Villages of Yaka and Agbandé. In Bénin, the Lambas live in and around Boucoumbé (Boukamtié) in the [[Atakora Department]] and near [[Djougou]] and [[Bassila]] in the [[Donga Department]]. They also live in diaspora zones in the Central and Plateaux Regions of Togo, in border areas of Ghana, and in the capital cities of [[Lomé]] and [[Cotonou]].

==People==

The Lambas are primarily engaged in [[subsistence farming]] and small animal husbandry, especially chickens, guinea fowl, goats, pigs, and sheep. They grow [[millet]] and [[sorghum]] that they make into a thick porridge (''la pâte'') that is the staple of their diet and that they brew into [[African Sorghum Beer|thick low-alcohol beer]]. They also grow [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]] and [[cassava]], [[Macrotyloma geocarpum|groundnuts]] (peanuts), beans, and [[fonio]].

The Lambas have migrated in search of fertile available land in Togo to the area along the North-South National Road No. 1 between Sokodé and Notsé, where they have founded numerous communities. In addition, they have migrated to Togo's capital city, Lomé, and the economic capital of Bénin, Cotonou, in search of wage employment. Lamba men served in the colonial armies of Germany, Britain, and France as well as in the Togolese and Beninese armies in the years following the independences of the two countries.

The Lambas refer to themselves and to their Language as Lama. Lamba is the name attributed to them in French and that continues to be used in the administration. In addition, all of the inhabitants of the Doufelgou District of Togo were designated as Lossos by the colonial administration, including people who identify themselves as Lama and Nawdba. Therefore, Lambas from the Doufelgou District are still frequently called Losso. The two populations have exercised considerable mutual influence but their languages are different and do not resemble each other.

==Language==

The Lambas speak a collection of closely related dialects that are grouped together as the  [[Lama language]]. There are approximately 200,000 native speakers of Lama in Togo and Bénin. Lama most closely resembles the [[Kabiyé language]] spoken by the Kabiyé people in the Kozah and Binah Districts of Togo as well as in diaspora points. Lama and [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=kbp Kabiyé] are classified under the [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90744 Grusi, Eastern] cluster of the [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90721 Gur (or ''Voltaique'')] group of the [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90725 Niger-Congo] languages. Also included in this cluster are Tem (Cotokoli), Bagou-Koussountou, Lukpa (Logba or Dompago), Delo (Ntribou), and Chala. Speakers of this cluster of languages constitute 28% of the population of Togo and are the second most widely spoken cluster of languages in Togo after the Gbé cluster that includes Éwé, Mina, and Waci.

{{Lebanese people}}

'''Lebanese Mexicans''' refers to [[Mexicans|Mexican]] citizens of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] origin.

Although Lebanese Mexicans made up less than 5% of the total immigrant population in [[Mexico]] during the 1930s, they constituted half of the immigrant economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://confines.mty.itesm.mx/articulos2/GarciaRE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327124211/https://confines.mty.itesm.mx/articulos2/GarciaRE.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebanese influence in [[Culture of Mexico|Mexican culture]] can be seen most particularly in [[Mexican cuisine]], where they have introduced many foods and dishes and created their own recipes such as ''[[al pastor]]''.

Interethnic marriage in the Lebanese community, regardless of religious affiliation, is very high; most have only one parent with Lebanese ethnicity. As a result, only a few speak any Arabic, typically limited to a few basic words. The majority, especially among younger generations, speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as first language.

[[Carlos Slim]], formerly the richest man in the world,&lt;ref name="Mexico"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/carlos-slim-helu |title= Carlos Slim Helu &amp; family |work=Forbes |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of Lebanese Mexican success in Mexican society.

==Migration history==
Lebanese immigration to Mexico started in the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-536840/Marin-Guzman-Roberto-and-Zidane.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112143920/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-536840/Marin-Guzman-Roberto-and-Zidane.html#abstract |archive-date=12 January 2008 |title=Marin-Guzman, Roberto and Zidane Zeraoui. Arab Immigration in Mexico in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries: Assimilation and Arab Heritage.(Book Review)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892, the first Lebanese arrived in Mexico from [[Beirut]] in French ships to Mexican ports such as [[Progreso, Yucatán|Puerto Progreso]], [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] and [[Tampico, Tamaulipas|Tampico]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} At that time, [[Beirut Vilayet|Lebanon was not an independent nation]]; the territory was held by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and later became a [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French protectorate]]. Roughly 100,000 [[Arabic language|Arabic-speakers]] settled in Mexico during this time period. They settled in significant numbers in [[Yucatán]], [[Nayarit|Veracruz]], [[Puebla]], [[Mexico City]] and the northern part of the country (mainly in the states of [[Baja California]], [[Nuevo León]], [[Sinaloa]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Coahuila]], and [[Durango]], as well as the city of [[Tampico]] and [[Guadalajara]]). 

Although Lebanese people made up less than 5% of the total immigrant population in Mexico during the 1930s, they constituted half of the immigrant economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://confines.mty.itesm.mx/articulos2/GarciaRE.pdf |title=Los árabes de México. Asimilación y herencia cultural |language=Spanish |accessdate=2010-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327124211/https://confines.mty.itesm.mx/articulos2/GarciaRE.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1948 Israel-Lebanon war]] and the [[Six-Day War]], thousands of Lebanese left Lebanon and went to Mexico, first arriving in Veracruz.

Another concentration of Lebanese-Mexicans is in Baja California facing the US&amp;ndash;Mexican border, especially in the cities of [[Mexicali, Baja California|Mexicali]] and [[Tijuana, Baja California|Tijuana]] across from [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] with a large [[Lebanese-American]] community (about 280,000), some of whose families have relatives in Mexico.

==Lebanese culture in Mexico==

[[File:Statue of Saint Charbel.JPG|180px|thumb|right|Statue with prayer requests at the [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral]]]]

One Lebanese cultural tradition in Mexico itself is to place colored ribbons to the image of St. Charbel to ask some favor or some miracle and to give thanks. The tradition arose in the Candelaria Church in Merced in the historic center of Mexico City.

The immigration of Lebanese to Mexico has influenced Mexican culture, in particular food, including introducing [[kibbeh]] and [[tabbouleh]], and even creating recipes such as ''[[tacos árabes]]''. By 1765, [[Phoenix dactylifera|dates]], which originated in North Africa and the Middle East, were introduced into Mexico by the Spaniards. The fusion between Arab and Mexican food has highly influenced the [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatecan]] cuisine.

==Religion==
The majority of Lebanese-Mexicans are [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christians]] who belong to the [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]], [[Roman Catholicism in Lebanon|Roman Catholic]], [[Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Melkite Christianity in Lebanon|Melkite Catholic]]. The Lebanese initially practiced Catholicism independently from other Mexicans, but learned to speak Spanish; Lebanese-Mexican children quickly joined the country's religious activities.

A few [[Islam in Lebanon|Lebanese Muslims]] settled in Mexico. They were responsible for the opening of the first mosque in Mexico, built in the city of [[Torreon]], in Coahuila, and named Suraya.

The '''Mambai''' ('''Mambae''', '''Manbae''') people are the second largest ethnic group after the Tetum Dili people in [[East Timor]]. Originally, they were known as the '''Maubere''' by the Portuguese. ''Maubere'' or ''Mau Bere'' is a widespread male first name among the Mambai people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth G.

Among the exiled ministers in Australia, the Mambai people are one of the main groups.

'''Maurice Abravanel''' (January 6, 1903 – September 22, 1993)&lt;ref name="Harvard Bio"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Harvard biographical dictionary of music|year=1996|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard Univ. Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0-674-37299-9|page=2|editor=Don Michael Randel|chapter=Abravanel, Maurice (de)}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States of America|American]] [[conductor (music)|conductor]] of classical music. He is remembered as the conductor of the [[Utah Symphony Orchestra]] for over 30 years.

==Life==
Abravanel was born in [[Salonika]], [[Rumelia Eyalet]], [[Ottoman Empire]] (modern [[Thessaloniki, Greece]]). He came from an illustrious [[Sephardic]] [[Jewish]] family, which was expelled from [[Spain]] in 1492 (see [[Isaac Abrabanel]]). Abravanel's ancestors settled in Salonika in 1517, and his parents were both born there. In 1909, the Abravanel family moved to [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, where the father, Edouard de Abravanel, was a successful [[pharmacist]].

For several years, the Abravanels lived in the same house as [[Ernest Ansermet]], the conductor of the [[Orchestre de la Suisse Romande]]. The young Abravanel played four-hand piano arrangements with Ansermet, began to compose, and met composers such as [[Darius Milhaud]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]]. He was passionate about music and knew he wanted a career as a musician. He became the pianist for the municipal theatre and [[music critic]] for the city's daily newspaper.

Maurice's father, however, insisted on a career in medicine and sent him to the [[University of Zürich]], where he was miserable at having to dissect corpses. He wrote to his father that he would rather be second percussionist in an orchestra than a doctor, and his father finally relented.&lt;ref&gt;Lowell M. Durham, Abravanel! (Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 1989), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abravanel lived in Germany from 1922 to 1933, heavily involving himself in the music scene there. He lived in Paris from 1933 to 1936, serving as music director of Balanchine's Paris Ballet, then conducting for two years in Australia. In 1936 Abravanel accepted a post at New York's Metropolitan Opera, becoming at age 33 the youngest conductor the Met had ever hired. He became a U.S. citizen in 1943. In 1947 he was hired as music director of the [[Utah Symphony]], and over the next 30 years raised the ensemble to international prominence, leading the symphony in live radio broadcasts and releasing more than 100 commercial recordings.&lt;ref name="Goodfellow, Deseret News, 1993"&gt;{{cite news|title=Former symphony director Maurice Abravanel dies at 90 |first=William S. |last=Goodfellow |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/311067/FORMER-SYMPHONY-DIRECTOR-MAURICE-ABRAVANEL-DIES-AT-90.htm |newspaper=[[Deseret News]] |date=September 22, 1993 |accessdate=26 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65BilIAiz?url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/311067/FORMER-SYMPHONY-DIRECTOR-MAURICE-ABRAVANEL-DIES-AT-90.html |archivedate=4 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abravanel was known as ''Maurice de Abravanel'' until 1938.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} He married singer Friedel Schako in 1933 and the couple moved to Paris that year when the [[Nazis]] came to power. The marriage ended in divorce in 1940, after Schako eloped with the conductor [[Otto Klemperer]]: the pair "went careering around the country...leaving a trail of unpaid bills."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scena.org/columns/lebrecht/030730-NL-klemperer.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodfellow, Deseret News, 1993"/&gt; In 1947, Abravanel married Lucy Menasse Carasso; they remained married until her death.

==Music career==
In 1922, during the depths of the depression of the [[Weimar Republic]], Abravanel, then age 19, moved to Berlin. Despite the difficult economic situation, Berlin supported three opera houses, which staged performances every night of the year. [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]], [[Bruno Walter]], [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Otto Klemperer]] were all conducting opera in Berlin at that time.

Abravanel became a student of the composer [[Kurt Weill]] (3 years his senior), who had to accept up to 46 students to make ends meet. Abravanel later commented that Weill was "a lousy teacher", but became his close friend and enthusiastic supporter.&lt;ref&gt;NY Times obituary&lt;/ref&gt; After a year of study, Abravanel landed a job as an accompanist at the opera in [[Neustrelitz]], just north of Berlin.  At the time, this was a good career path towards becoming a conductor because the accompanist rehearsed and coached the singers and would sometimes be called on to substitute when the conductor was unable to conduct at short notice.

In 1924, the theatre in Neustrelitz burned down, and the four conductors found work elsewhere. The members of the orchestra asked Abravanel if he would conduct performances at the castle. He conducted orchestra concerts twice a week at the castle with no rehearsal. He even received some pay.

In 1925, Abravanel received a position as choral director in [[Zwickau]], in [[Saxony]]. He spent two years there, conducting the operetta repertoire. Because of his success in Zwickau, he was given a position as regular conductor at a better theatre in [[Altenburg]].

After two years in Altenburg, Abravanel was appointed conductor at his first major opera house in Kassel. In 1931, the director of the Berlin State Opera saw him conduct a performance of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[La forza del destino]]''. He asked him to come to Berlin and conduct a performance at the Berlin State Opera. The orchestra was impressed and applauded Abravanel. This was important because at that time the orchestra decided whether a guest conductor would be asked to return. Abravanel became a regular guest conductor.

Because of the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]], prominent Jewish musicians were being forced to leave Germany.  Feeling this danger, Abravanel chose to relocate to Paris along with Kurt Weill in 1933.

In Paris, he worked with [[Bruno Walter]]. Walter was a friend of and authority on the music of [[Gustav Mahler]]. Walter recommended Abravanel as a guest conductor at the Paris Opera, and he was able to cast, rehearse, and conduct [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' there. He also had the opportunity to conduct the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Paris]], the regular conductor of which was [[Pierre Monteux]].  He also met [[George Balanchine]] in Paris and conducted his ballets, as well as conducting the works of his old teacher and friend, Kurt Weill.  Weill and Balanchine collaborated on a ballet, ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins (ballet chanté)|The Seven Deadly Sins]]'', which had its premiere in Paris.  Abravanel was the conductor.

Weill left Paris for London, and then New York (1935), and the Abravanels left Paris for Australia (1934). Maurice had been offered a chance to direct both the [[Melbourne Opera|Melbourne]] and the [[Sydney Opera|Sydney]] opera. After a six-week journey through the [[Suez Canal]] and across the [[Indian Ocean]], he arrived to be acclaimed as the "eminent continental conductor."

He conducted a 13-week season in Melbourne and a two-month season in Sydney with Verdi's ''[[Aida]]'' as the opener in both cities and a balanced selection of the standard repertoire, including [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]].

In mid-spring of 1936, he received an offer from the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York to come and conduct the German and French repertoire. At age 33, Abravanel became the youngest contracted conductor in the history of the Met.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brittanica.com/EBchecked/topic/1630/Maurice_Abravanel Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; He was offered a three-year contract, only two years of which were fulfilled, due to internal politics at the Met.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} For the next several years, Abravanel filled several temporary conducting stints on and around Broadway, and tried to emphasize Weill's music wherever possible.

In 1946 the community orchestra known as the [[Utah Symphony Orchestra|Utah State Symphony Orchestra]] began advertising for a conductor, and Abravanel applied, stating that he wanted to build a permanent orchestra of his own. He was selected from a field of 40 applicants for the position, receiving a one-year contract.  In accepting the Utah offer he had to reject a lucrative contract from [[Radio City Music Hall]], and he ended up working without pay several times during the orchestra's darkest days.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=q9245|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  The one-year contract&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.music.utah.edu/mckay_music_library/maurice_abravanel Utah.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609182702/http://www.music.utah.edu/mckay_music_library/maurice_abravanel |date=2010-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; became a 32-year career.  During that time Abravanel built the orchestra from a part-time community orchestra into a well-respected, professional ensemble with recording contracts with Vanguard, Vox, Angel, and CBS. He lobbied for years for a permanent home for the orchestra, and realized this dream when Salt Lake's Symphony Hall opened in September 1979, shortly after he retired for health reasons.

In addition to becoming known as a major interpreter of classical composers, Abravanel championed contemporary music, recording the music of [[Crawford Gates]] and [[Leroy Robertson]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Allmusic.com&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1954 to 1980, Abravanel also directed the [[Music Academy of the West]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]],&lt;ref name="Harvard Bio" /&gt; where young musicians gathered for summer music camps. He taught conducting at [[Tanglewood]], where he was appointed artist-in-residence for life. In his later years he received various honors: The [[American Symphony Orchestra League]] gave him its Gold Baton in 1981; President Bush presented him with the [[National Medal of Arts]] in 1991; and in 1993 Salt Lake City renamed its Symphony Hall [[Abravanel Hall]].

Abravanel is remembered for making classic recordings of the [[Berlioz Requiem]], several orchestral works by [[Edgar Varèse]], and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]].

'''Micro-initiatives''' are individual and collective actors who by means of interventions in [[public space]] contribute to the development of their cities from the bottom-up.
Micro-initiatives are difficult to judge by their [[efficiency]] and [[Asset turnover|turnover]], but have strong social and political merits. Although most of them emerge from strong local connections and commitments, these initiatives engage with issues that go beyond their local community -like [[immigration]], [[education]], [[demography]], [[democracy]], [[urban regeneration]], participation- and therefore try to make links with like-minded groups in other countries.

Another manner of considering a micro-initiative is, ''making radical changes in minute steps''&lt;ref&gt;http://tziglar.wordpress.com/2009/11/25/radical-changes-in-minute-steps/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strosahl, K., Robinson, P., &amp; Gustavsson, T. (2012). Brief Interventions for Radical Change: Principles and Practice of Focused Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. New Harbinger Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; whereby changes are implemented incrementally, rather than volatile, abrupt or sudden. The introduction of micro-initiatives can be recognized in the ''transformational leadership style''&lt;ref&gt;[[Transformational leadership]]&lt;/ref&gt; of successful leaders across the spectrum of operations.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, R. B., &amp; Santos, R. G. (2012). The Role of Leadership in Implementing a Police Organizational Model for Crime Reduction and Accountability. Policing, 6(4), 344-353. doi: 10.1093/police/pas029&lt;/ref&gt; Principle among these changes is the melding of the individual beliefs' perspectives, and goals into the organizational vision and goals.&lt;ref&gt;Vakola, M., Armenakis, A., &amp; Oreg, S. (2013). 5 Reactions to organizational change from an individual differences perspective: a review of empirical research. The Psychology of Organizational Change: Viewing Change from the Employee's Perspective, 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The question as to whether the individual's objectives support those of the organization, and thus spur it onward to success; or whether the organizations objectives work to modify those of the individual&lt;ref&gt;Ashkenas, R. (June 10, 2013). "Two Principles For Addressing The Chicken-Egg Problem In Organizational Change". Forbes online. Retrieved 06/11/13. https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronashkenas/2013/06/10/two-principles-for-addressing-the-chicken-egg-problem-in-organizational-change/&lt;/ref&gt; can be debated to the same conclusion; change that is explained, and incrementally integrated, with a clear vision, is far more likely to be supported and sustained by the stakeholders.

'''Miguel "El Gringo" Villarreal''' (died on 10 March 2013) was an alleged drug trafficker and high-ranking leader of the [[Gulf Cartel]], a Mexican drug trafficking organization. He was the crime boss of [[Reynosa, Tamaulipas]].

Nicknamed ''[[Gringo|El Gringo]]'' in reference to his U.S. nationality, Villarreal was identified by authorities as a Gulf Cartel leader in 2010, when he allegedly commanded cells that fought [[Los Zetas]] [[drug cartel]] in northeastern Mexico. By 2011, he served as the regional kingpin in [[Ciudad Miguel Alemán, Tamaulipas|Miguel Alemán, Tamaulipas]] and ordered several kidnappings and killings in the [[South Texas]] border area from Mexico. Throughout 2011 and 2012, Mexican media outlets reported on two occasions that Villarreal had been killed in armed confrontations with rival drug traffickers and Mexican law enforcement officers. By then, rival factions within the Gulf Cartel were [[Infighting in the Gulf Cartel|fighting amongst each other]] for the control of the [[Tamaulipas]] and the cartel.

Although not officially confirmed, [[Stratfor]] intelligence agency reported that Villarreal was killed in a three-hour gunfight that left at least three dozen dead in Reynosa, Tamaulipas on 10 March 2013. The shootout was caused by an attempt by [[Mario Ramírez Treviño]], another high-ranking drug lord of the Gulf Cartel, to remove his rivals and become the undisputed leader of the cartel.

By early 2011, Villarreal was the regional boss of the Gulf Cartel in the border city of [[Ciudad Miguel Alemán, Tamaulipas|Miguel Alemán, Tamaulipas]], just across the international border from [[Roma, Texas]].&lt;ref name=altontx/&gt; Reportedly, Villarreal had ordered his henchman in South Texas to carryout several kidnappings in the [[Rio Grande Valley]] and take their victims to Mexico after a cocaine shipment was stolen in 2011. He was also accused of ordering several murders in the Texas-Mexico border area. The modus operandi of Villarreal on U.S. soil was similar to that of the imprisoned Zetas drug lord [[Jaime González Durán]] (''El Hummer''), who conducted kidnappings of rival cartel members in South Texas in 2008.&lt;ref name=elgringovilla/&gt;&lt;ref name=reynosa2/&gt;&lt;ref name=altontx&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Jared|title=Gulf Cartel launched kidnapping ring in Rio Grande Valley last year|url=http://www.themonitor.com/articles/last-58172-launched-cartel.html|accessdate=12 August 2012|newspaper=[[The Monitor (Texas)|The Monitor]]|date=23 January 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69r6rbvpB?url=http://www.themonitor.com/articles/last-58172-launched-cartel.html|archivedate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2011, an [[Infighting in the Gulf Cartel|internal power struggle within the Gulf Cartel]] broke loose when the drug lord [[Samuel Flores Borrego]] was killed by his own men.&lt;ref name=mrl&gt;{{cite news|title=Internal struggle in the Gulf Cartel could weaken the organization |url=http://www.themonitor.com/articles/struggle-56156-internal-cartel.html |accessdate=9 August 2012 |newspaper=[[The Monitor (Texas)|The Monitor]] |date=29 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69nYd4lvi?url=http://www.themonitor.com/articles/struggle-56156-internal-cartel.html |archivedate=9 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Villarreal later became a key player in the cartel's internal strife in the first quarter of 2013.&lt;ref name=balka/&gt;

| project = }}'''Multicommunicating'''  is the practice of engaging in more than one conversation at a time. It is defined as, "engaging in two or more overlapping, synchronous conversations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.degarmo.com/multicommunicating-effectively-to-increase-productivity|title=Multicommunicating Effectively to Increase Productivity {{!}} DeGarmo|website=www.degarmo.com|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term multicommunicating was coined by Turner, Reinsch and Tinsley,&lt;ref name="Turner, J. W. 2008"&gt;Turner, J. W., Reinsch, L. &amp; Tinsley, C. (2008). Multicommunicating: A practice whose time has come? Academy of Management Review, 33(2), 391-403.&lt;/ref&gt; who propose that [[Simultaneity|simultaneous]] conversations can be conducted using an ever increasing array of media, including face-to-face, phone and email tools for [[communication]]. Multicommunicating evolves with the rapid development of [[Information and communications technology|ICT]]. It has become more and more prevalent in recent years and it has received attention from academic fields. Up to now, the majority of academic [[research]] focuses on its professional implications and outlines a number of key factors shaping the act of multicommunicating. For instance, the flexibility of communication tempo, the compartmentalization of conversations, and the topics and intensity of interactions are all contributing factors toward a person's choice of engaging in multicommunicating as well as his or her ultimate success with the practice.

The reason why multicommunicating is possible from a physiological and [[Cognition|cognitive]] perspective is because humans, or '''presence allocators''', are typically able to think faster than they are able to talk or type.&lt;ref name="Turner, J. W. 2008"/&gt; Nonetheless, most neuroscience studies imply that we are not truly cognitively capable of multitasking; we are just able to switch between tasks. This means that those of us who are most adept at apparent multitasking, or multicommunicating, are essentially very quick at juggling our attention(s) between messages.&lt;ref&gt;Ocasio, W. (2011). Attention to Attention. Journal of Organizational Science, 22(5), 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, many people engage in multiple conversations as a direct response to the requests of others. Employees frequently believe that multicommunicating increases their [[productivity]] and work [[efficiency]], however in-depth interviews about the practice of multicommunicating have often revealed some mixed results. Research has also shown that the most commonly used combinations for multicommunicating are the telephone and email, followed by the telephone and text-based messaging (text message, instant message, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. W., &amp; Reinsch, L. (no year). Multicommunicating and Interpersonal Presence: Developing New Constructs for Studying New Phenomena.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

As a concept, multicommunicating primarily builds off [[Edward T. Hall|Hall]]'s work on [[polychronicity]], [[Goffman]]'s theory of the presentation of self, and [[Richard L. Daft|Daft]] and Lengel's notion of [[Media richness theory|media richness]]; Multicommunicating is also similar in nature to the notion of [[human multitasking|multitasking]]. However, where multicommunicating departs from all of these previous concepts is that it refers specifically to managing multiple conversations, people and media&amp;nbsp;– not just tasks&amp;nbsp;– at the same time. Stephen, Cho and Ballard elucidate this distinction in a 2011 paper which compares dovetailing (sequential communication) with mutlicommunication (simultaneous interactions).&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, K., Cho, J., &amp; Ballard, D. (2012). Simultaneity, Sequentiality, and Speed: Organizational Messages About Multiple-Task Completion. Human Communication Research, 38(1), 23-47.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, multicommunicating often occurs unbeknown to one's communication partners.

Multicommunicating is closely related to [[Edward T. Hall|Hall]]'s 1959 work on [[polychronicity]]; in fact, multicommunicating was initially called 'polychronic communication' in one of Turner and Reinsch' first scholarly presentations of the concept to the wider academic community.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. W., &amp; Reinsch, L. (2005). Polychronic Communication in the Workplace: The Temporal Structure of "Connected Time". Paper Presented at the National Communication Association Conference, Boston, MA, November, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1959 book ''The Silent Language'' Hall coined the term polychronicity and in subsequent works developed the argument that polychronicity is a measure of a culture's preference toward engaging in several activities at a time. An important conceptual transition then occurred in the late 90's, when Bluedron&lt;ref&gt;Bluedorn, A. C., et al. (1999). Polychronicity and the inventory of polychronic values (IVP): The development of an instrument to measure a fundamental dimension of organizational culture. Journal of Managerial Psychology, 14(3/4), 205-230.&lt;/ref&gt; became one of the first scholars to adapt the term polychronicity from the cultural context and to apply it to the workplace.

[[Goffman]]'s theory of [[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life|the presentation of self]], which suggests that people engage in a world of multistage dramas, also plays an informing role in the construction of multicommunicating. The notion that we tailor our behavior to suit our environmental contexts and situations is indeed, true in conversations, too. Nonetheless, where multicommunicating differentiates itself from Goffman's theory of the presentation of self is that a 'presence allocator' picks up their appropriate behavior cues from the interaction and the [[Media (communication)|medium]] itself as opposed to the 'actor', who picks up his or her cues for appropriate behavior from their physical environment.

[[Richard L. Daft|Daft]] and Lengel's research on media richness theory or, how employees choose which technologies to use in the workplace, is another important concept for multicommunicating. Similar to [[Marshall McLuhan|McLuhan]]'s notion of '[[The Medium Is the Massage|the medium is the message]]', Daft and Lengel argue that different media have varying qualities that make them more or less suited for certain interactions. For example, a relatively complex interaction, such as an important conversation with a new business partner, will likely be carried out with as rich a medium as possible. This rich medium would be a communication technology, like Skype or even a face-to-face conversation, which would allow for maximum information and submersion in the interaction. Conversely, a more casual and routine conversation, such as the making of lunch plans with a co-worker, could easily be carried out over a less contextually rich medium like an office chat or a text message.

Organizational norms shape the frequency and usage of multicommunication within an organization. In this sense, the practice of multicommunicating is a type of multiple media practices, also known as [[multimedia]], because people often use more than one media when engaging in multiple conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/951778628|title=The international encyclopedia of organizational communication|others=Scott, Craig R.

Multicommunicating takes the medium selection concept from media richness theory and suggests that some of the same characteristics that contribute to making medium choices may also contribute to the reasons a person might multicommunicate.  For example, if a conversation is not very complicated or equivocal, a person might be more likely to engage in multiple conversations.  A conversation that is more complicated might make it hard for multicommunicating to take place.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. W., &amp; Reinsch, L. (2007). The Business Communicator as Presence Allocator: Multicommunicating, Equivocality, and Status at Work (2007). Journal of Business Communication, 44(1), 36-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Closely connected to [[media richness theory]] is also the notion of [[Channel expansion theory|Channel Expansion Theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, J., &amp; Zmud, R. (1995). Channel Expansion Theory and the Experiential.  The Academy of Management Journal, 42(2), 153-170.&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that as an individual becomes more familiar with a specific [[technology]], his or her perception of its capabilities and richness expands. Thus, somebody who is very comfortable with a certain chat site may perceive it to be richer in contextual nature than somebody who is only familiar with its most basic functionalities. This contributes to our understanding of multicommunicating in the sense that a persons' experience with various media may make them more adept at picking up contextually rich conversation signals as well as more prepared for handling certain communication technologies. However, even though [[channel expansion theory]] implies there are positive effects associated with the familiarity of a technology, this does not necessarily suggest that as a person's perception of media richness increases, the process of multicommunicating becomes simplified.

== Versus multitasking ==
The difference between multicommunicating and [[Media multitasking|multitasking]] can be confusing since both of the terms talk about people participating in two events at the same time. Scholars in the field of communication have made clear definition of the relationship between these two phenomena. They believe that multitasking has broader scope than multicommunicating which is one complex form of multitasking. Multitasking refers to a user engaging in multitasking behavior when s/he performs more than one unrelated  task concurrently,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benbunan-Fich|first=Raquel|last2=Adler|first2=Rachel F.|last3=Mavlanova|first3=Tamilla|date=2011-07-01|title=Measuring Multitasking Behavior with Activity-based Metrics|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1970378.1970381|journal=ACM Trans. Comput.-Hum. Interact.|volume=18|issue=2|pages=7:1–7:22|doi=10.1145/1970378.1970381|issn=1073-0516}}&lt;/ref&gt; which simply emphasizes task independence and performance concurrency. Multicommunicating, however, involves people participating in two simultaneous conversations, which not only requires adequate attention on both tasks, but also coordination between the two.

In addition to multicommunicating, multitasking also includes electronic multitasking,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Keri K.|last2=Davis|first2=Jennifer|date=2009-06-08|title=The Social Influences on Electronic Multitasking in Organizational Meetings|url=http://mcq.sagepub.com/content/early/2009/06/08/0893318909335417|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|language=en|doi=10.1177/0893318909335417|issn=0893-3189}}&lt;/ref&gt; invisible whispering,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dennis|first=Alan R.|last2=Rennecker|first2=Julie A.|last3=Hansen|first3=Sean|date=2010-11-01|title=Invisible Whispering: Restructuring Collaborative Decision Making with Instant Messaging|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5915.2010.00290.x/abstract|journal=Decision Sciences|language=en|volume=41|issue=4|pages=845–886|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5915.2010.00290.x|issn=1540-5915}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social multitasking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=05/09/2008|title=Adjusting the Volume: Technology and Multitasking in Discourse Control.|url=|journal=Handbook of mobile communication studies|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of these subcategories are separated from others. They are overlapping with other categories more or less.

==Specific characteristics==

Research suggests that there are two characteristics which help to determine a person's choice of communication media when engaging in multicommunicating: compartmentalization and flexibility of tempo.

===Compartmentalization===
{{Quote_box
 |width=30%
 |align=right
 |quote=compartmentalization and flexibility of tempo help to determine the success of an episode of multicommunicating}}
[[Compartmentalization (psychology)|Compartmentalization]] refers to the ability and ease of cross-conversations. For instance, an online chat allows one to relatively freely move from one conversation to another. In this case, the ability to hide conversations from the multiple communication partners is an important factor of compartmentalization, too.

===Flexibility of tempo===

Flexibility of tempo refers to the amount of time a person has to respond to a certain message. Face-to-face communication often allows for less flexibility of tempo than does a text message.

Most typically, users choose to combine media technologies such as the telephone (described as non-flexible in tempo and partially compartmentalized) with those such as electronic text (described as high in both flexibility and compartmentalization capabilities). Of course, sometimes presence allocators do not have a choice about one or more of the media they engage with. However, specific combinations of communication media may contribute strongly toward the success or, lack thereof, one has with multicommunicating.

==Successful and unsuccessful instances==

To multicommunicate or not to multicommunicate&amp;nbsp;– what is it that makes an multicommunicating episode successful? Several factors, including '''intensity''', '''topic of conversation''', '''[[Equivocation (information theory)|equivocality]]''', and the '''presence allocator''' themselves may help to determine the outcomes of an [[episode]] of multicommunicating.

=== Intensity of communication ===
'''Intensity''' of communication is one of the key factors in multicommunicating because it helps to predict the amount of attention and importance a specific conversation holds. Typically, conversation intensity increases with more, simultaneous conversations, a faster pace of conversion, a broader range of topics, and a wider mix of [[social role]]s. Overly high intensity has sometimes been reported as a factor for unsuccessful multicommunicating.

=== Topic of conversation ===
The '''topics''' or themes of episodes of multicommunicating are another key factor determining overall success. Put simply, the more alike the themes of the simultaneous conversations, the more congruent an experience and easier a time the presence allocator has in information processing and conversation-switching. Similarly, the more divergent the topics or themes of conversation, the bigger the cognitive strain on the presence allocator and the higher the chance for confusion or conversation mix-ups.

=== Equivocality ===
The notion of '''equivocality''' is closely related to topic or theme of communication and is another key factor, which may help to determine the success of multicommunicating. Equivocality refers to the possibility for misinterpretation and studies suggest that the higher the potential for equivocality in a conversation, the more likely an individual is to pick a medium of communication that is rich in contextual cues, or that has high media-richness. The possibility for equivocality extends to episodes of multicommunicating, too, and could potentially be compounded if one has to switch their attention between media&amp;nbsp;– or does not engage in [[rich-media]] conversations when necessary.

=== Presence allocator ===
There are limits to our working memory that in turn restrict our cognitive information processing capabilities. Performance deteriorates when these limits are exceeded. Because of these limits, performing two tasks at the same time or rapidly switching between two tasks results in decreased task performance in terms of accuracy and response time. These problems can be partially alleviated (but not eliminated) by practice and physical compatibility of the tasks being performed, but they increase with task complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Ann-Frances|last2=Webster|first2=Jane|date=2012-11-08|title=Multicommunicating: Juggling Multiple Conversations in the Workplace|url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1120.0446|journal=Information Systems Research|volume=24|issue=2|pages=352–371|doi=10.1287/isre.1120.0446|issn=1047-7047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, research advocates that presence allocators have the most successful experiences with multicommunicating episodes when engaged in multiple conversations with contextually appropriate media around similar topics. Likewise, the frequent reports of unsuccessful multicommunicating episodes include a sense of high intensity, equivocality and theme confusion. In those cases, information overload can occur to the point where a conversation slows down, becomes confounded or altogether stops.

==Implications==

While the study of multicommunicating is still in its emergent stages, it appears to be increasingly relevant to a fast-paced, multitasking society. Some implications of multicommunicating and suggestions for further studies include:

===Productivity===

Most people indicate that they multicommunicate in order to become more efficient. However, this goal of efficiency has received some mixed results. Despite the notion that getting several things done at once makes us more productive, research has indicated that polychronicity is negatively correlated with deadlines.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, C.F., Lane, P.M. and Lindquist, J.D. (1991). Exploring More than 24 Hours a Day: A Preliminary Investigation of Polychronic Time Use. Journal of Consumer Research, 18, 392–401.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, when it comes to communication and multiple conversations many people reveal a breaking point, at which they can no longer juggle [[Synchronity|synchronous]] messages. Significant numbers of research subjects also indicate that they prefer to stay away from multicommunicating altogether when it comes to important conversations which require strong attention.

Several scholars also hypothesized that perceived communication workload can influence people engaging in multicommunicating. Since perceived heavy workload gives people a sense of loss of time, which may result to people compensating for the effect of being overloaded by multicommunicating. However, as revealed by related research results, perceived communication overload did not predict meeting multitasking behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Stephens|first = Keri K.|last2 = Davis|first2 = Jennifer|date = 2009-06-08|title = The Social Influences on Electronic Multitasking in Organizational Meetings|url = http://mcq.sagepub.com/content/early/2009/06/08/0893318909335417|journal = Management Communication Quarterly|language = en|doi = 10.1177/0893318909335417|issn = 0893-3189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perceived incivility ===
By employing the [[social exchange theory]], which views social behavior as "an exchange of goods, material goods but also non-material ones, such as the symbols of approval or prestige" where "persons that give much to others try to get much from them, and persons that get much from others are under pressure to give much to them",&lt;ref&gt;Homans, G. C. 1958. Social behavior as exchange. Amer. J. Sociol. 63(3) 597–606.&lt;/ref&gt; Carmeno and Webster examine the relational outcomes of multicommunicating from the following aspects: Partners-VS Focal-Initiated Conversation, Conversation Leveraging, Multicommunicating Performance, Focal Individual Accessibility, Partner's Polychronic Communication Orientation, Awareness and Media Fit. In their research, they suggest that Multicommunicating has the potential to build up or damage our workplace relationships. And the incivility perceived in multicommunicating may lead to mistrust in working places.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Cameron, A., &amp; Webster, J. (2010). Relational Outcomes of Multicommunicating: Integrating Incivility and Social Exchange Perspectives. Organizational Science, 22(3), 754-771.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical uses of this theory ==

=== '''Personal Interaction''' ===
Staying “connected has become a societal norm and a personal habit in our society, especially with the development of new information communication technologies (ICTs). Bayer, Campbell &amp; Ling&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bayer|first=Joseph B.|last2=Campbell|first2=Scott W.|last3=Ling|first3=Rich|date=2015-11-24|title=Connection Cues: Activating the Norms and Habits of Social Connectedness|url=https://academic.oup.com/ct/article/26/2/128/4061221|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=26|issue=2|pages=128–149|doi=10.1111/comt.12090|issn=1050-3293}}&lt;/ref&gt; explain how individuals internalize and activate social connectedness during daily life. The model outlined typed of connection cues, factors, that moderate sensitivity to connection norms, and activation paths for connection habits. But what does it really mean to stay “connected”? Does it mean that our physical presence also determines our social presence? The research done by Turner &amp; Foss&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=Jeanine Warisse|last2=Foss|first2=Sonja K|date=2018-02-01|title=Options for the Construction of Attentional Social Presence in a Digitally Enhanced Multicommunicative Environment|url=https://academic.oup.com/ct/article-abstract/28/1/22/4944963?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=22–45|doi=10.1093/ct/qty002|issn=1050-3293}}&lt;/ref&gt;” suggests that there are four types of presences when we engage in multiple conversations: '''budgeted''', '''entitled''', '''competitive''' and '''invitational'''. 

* Budgeted presence happens when you engage in multiple conversations at once,for instance, talking to your friend while also sending an email.
* Entitled presence happens when you can take your audience’s technology away or someone takes  your technology away, for instance, you're in class and the professor asks to put your phones away.
* Competitive presence happens when you try to persuade other people or group of people to pay attention to you, and you seem to have to compete with their communication technology, for instance, when you're trying to share a personal story with your friend, but they're on their phone and are not paying attention to you.
* Invitational presence happens when you decide to focus on your audience and you are making a concrete effort to be in the moment (only one conversation), you are focused only on that interaction, for instance, you are having a one-on-one conversation with your friend, there is no technology involved and there are no distractions. 

Each presence involves the control of our audience and technology, the choices we make, and how we interact. 

Is there a way to measure our social presence? In her paper “Toward a more robust theory and measure of social presence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biocca|first=Frank|last2=Harms|first2=Chad|last3=Burgoon|first3=Judee K.|date=2003-10|title=Toward a More Robust Theory and Measure of Social Presence: Review and Suggested Criteria|url=https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/105474603322761270|journal=Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments|language=en|volume=12|issue=5|pages=456–480|doi=10.1162/105474603322761270|issn=1054-7460}}&lt;/ref&gt;” Biocca, Harms &amp; Burgoon contribute to the understanding of social behavior in mediated environments, which allows researchers to predict and measure differences among interfaces and guide the design of new social environments and interfaces

===Organizational norms and perceptions===
Multicommunicating is especially present in team collaborations. In order to be more effective in their workplace, teams would use different platforms for their communication practices. There are a number of communication platforms such as [[Slack (software)|Slack]] that include multiple '''Social Media Channels''' (social networking platforms and instant messaging). The media capabilities of these platforms, including integrations for diverse information and communication technologies, enable '''[[Affordance|affordances]]''' for both highly adaptable and centralized team communication practices. A recent research shows that team communication platforms (also known as TCPs) enable affordances for multicommunication and attention allocation including flexible scaling of '''media modality''' and '''synchronicity'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anders|first=Abram|date=2016-01-19|title=Team Communication Platforms and Emergent Social Collaboration Practices|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F2329488415627273|journal=International Journal of Business Communication|language=en|volume=53|issue=2|pages=224–261|doi=10.1177/2329488415627273|issn=2329-4884}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Another important factor to consider with multicommunicating is the organizational context and the perception of others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In organizational settings, research suggests that individual's decisions to use informational communication technology are influenced by what they observe other members do in the organization, which is positive related to their multicommunicating behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Keri K.|date=2009|title=The Social Influences on Electronic Multitasking in Organizational Meetings|url=|journal=Management Communication Quarterly Online|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perception of what others think about multicommunicating is also another significant predictor on this behaviors. Often, people hide the fact that they are multicommunicating from their conversational partners because they report an underlying perception of rudeness or partiality of conversational investment associated with multicommunicating. However, if people perceive that multicommunicating is acceptable in the organizations, they will not feel embarrassed and will engage in this kind of behaviors more often.

Depending on the organizational culture, multicommunicating can become particularly crucial and bear negative effects in a professional or office setting. Conversely, research suggests that employees who follow [[organizational communication]] norms receive higher performance ratings than those who don't. therefore, if multicommunicating were considered an organizational '[[Norm (social)|norm]]', its practice could also bring positive feedback.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

While multicommunicating can be a controversial topic in research and practice, it is an increasingly common organizational realty. Further research into cognitive abilities, organizational settings and expanding virtual work opportunities, as well as technology will likely carry significant findings for our personal and professional lives.

=== Multicommunication on Workplace Productivity ===
Multicimmunication can change the ways in which teams work and interact within the organization.

An important factor to consider with multicommunicating is the organizational context and the perception of others. In their research Stephens and Davis (2009) talk about the social influences on electronic multitasking in organizational meetings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Keri K.|last2=Davis|first2=Jennifer|date=2009-06-08|title=The Social Influences on Electronic Multitasking in Organizational Meetings|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0893318909335417|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|pages=63–83|doi=10.1177/0893318909335417|issn=0893-3189}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Information and communications technology|ICT]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s have infiltrated meetings and allowed a new range of communicative behaviors to emerge. The observation of organizational norms and the perception of others’ thoughts concerning the use of ICTs for multitasking during a meeting explain a considerable amount of variance in how individuals use ICTs to communicate electronically in meetings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Keri K.|last2=Davis|first2=Jennifer|date=2009-06-08|title=The Social Influences on Electronic Multitasking in Organizational Meetings|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0893318909335417|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|pages=63–83|doi=10.1177/0893318909335417|issn=0893-3189}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Relating to this point, Belanger and Watson (2006) made a study exploring how virtual team members structure their use of multiple media to attain strategic goals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bélanger|first=France|last2=Watson-Manheim|first2=Mary Beth|date=2006-07|title=Virtual Teams and Multiple Media: Structuring Media Use to Attain Strategic Goals|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10726-006-9044-8|journal=Group Decision and Negotiation|language=en|volume=15|issue=4|pages=299–321|doi=10.1007/s10726-006-9044-8|issn=0926-2644}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In today’s work environment, individuals working in teams must learn to manage their time for communication and coordination, and to add to this complexity teams can range from completely virtual environments to face-to-face and all the technologies that are involved. Cardon and Dai (2014) did a study that examines the nature of mobile phone use in meetings among Chinese professionals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=W.|first=Cardon, Peter|last2=Ying|first2=Dai,|date=2014|title=Mobile Phone Use in Meetings among Chinese Professionals: Perspectives on Multicommunication and Civility|url=https://commons.emich.edu/gabc/vol3/iss1/2/|journal=Global Advances in Business Communication|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|issn=2164-1692}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Using mobile phones in meetings is a form of multicommunicaion, but the etiquette associated with mobile phone use differ across cultures. Multicommunicating via mobile phones in meetings is mostly client-based and relationship-based, and it changes among cultures and across generations.

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], '''Mutunus Tutunus''' or '''Mutinus Titinus''' was a [[phallus|phallic]] marriage deity, in some respects equated with [[Priapus]]. His shrine was located on the [[Velian Hill]], supposedly since the [[founding of Rome]], until the 1st century BC.

During preliminary [[Marriage in ancient Rome|marriage rites]], Roman brides are supposed to have straddled the phallus of Mutunus to prepare themselves for intercourse, according to [[Church Fathers]] who interpreted this act as an obscene loss of [[virginity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[H.J. Rose]], ''The'' Roman Questions'' of Plutarch: A New Translation'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1924, reprinted 1974), p. 84 [https://books.google.com/books?id=rKOuoVnZsFAC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22Mutunus+Tutunus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=17#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mutunus%20Tutunus%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian apologist [[Arnobius]] says that Roman matrons were taken for a ride (''inequitare'') on Tutunus's "awful phallus" with its "immense shameful parts",&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnobius]], ''Adversus nationes'' 4.7 (see also 4.11): ''Tutunus, cuius immanibus pudendis horrentique fascino vestras inequitare matronas et auspicabile ducitis et optatis''. Compare [[Tertullian]], ''Ad nationes'' 2.11 and ''Apologeticus'' 25.3. On the translation of ''pudendis'', see J.N. Adams, ''The Latin Sexual Vocabulary'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1982, 1990), pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; but other sources specify that it is brides who learned through the ritual not to be embarrassed by sex: "Tutinus, upon whose shameful lap sit brides, so that the god seems to sample their shame before the fact."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lactantius]], ''Divinarum Institutionum'' 1.20.36: ''Tutinus in cuius sinu pudendo nubentes praesident ut illarum pudicitiam prior deus delibasse videatur''. See also [[Augustine of Hippo]] (particularly ''[[De civitate Dei]]'' 4.11 and 6.9) who "several times refers with distaste to the practices associated with" the priapic gods; R.W. Dyson, ''The City of God Against the Pagans'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998, 2002), p. 1221 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ReU2M8cLtGcC&amp;pg=PA1221&amp;dq=%22Mutunus+Tutunus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mutunus%20Tutunus%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2nd-century grammarian [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] is the only classical Latin source to take note of the god,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Noël Robert]], ''Eros romano: sexo y moral en la Roma antigua'' (Editorial Complutense, 1999), p. 58 [https://books.google.com/books?id=1wS-vtfUdbUC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=%22este+fascinus+tiene+nombre+y+se+le+honra+como+a+un+dios+Mutunus+Tutunus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22este%20fascinus%20tiene%20nombre%20y%20se%20le%20honra%20como%20a%20un%20dios%20Mutunus%20Tutunus%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the characterization of the rite by Christian sources is likely to be hostile or biased.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Syme]], ''The Augustan Aristocracy'' (Oxford University Press, 1989), p. 6, note 37, marks "the mockery of the Christian writers"; see also Augustine's "distaste" for the phallic gods noted above.

Tertullian's bias in his assemblage of deities to deride (including Mutunus) pointed out by [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], John North ''et al.'', ''Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 359, note 1 [https://books.google.com/books?id=xQd82l39KX4C&amp;pg=PA359&amp;dq=Christian+mutunus+OR+tutunus+OR+mutinus+OR+titinus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=17#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20mutunus%20OR%20tutunus%20OR%20mutinus%20OR%20titinus&amp;f=false online.] The ''fascinum'' — identified by Arnobius with the phallus of Mutunus — "was used by Christian writers in their tirades against pagan customs," points out Enrique Montero Cartelle, ''El latín erótico: aspectos léxicos y literarios'' (University of Seville, 1991), p. 70 [https://books.google.com/books?id=vUfXS1qQg9MC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=%22Fascinum+fue+empleado+por+los+escritores+cristianos%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fascinum%20fue%20empleado%20por%20los%20escritores%20cristianos%22&amp;f=false online.] For a fuller discussion, see Carlos A. Contreras, "Christian Views of Paganism," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.23.1 (1980) 974–1022, p. 1013 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0soI8HZXT3gC&amp;pg=PA1013&amp;dq=Christian+mutunus+OR+tutunus+OR+mutinus+OR+titinus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=40#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20mutunus%20OR%20tutunus%20OR%20mutinus%20OR%20titinus&amp;f=false online] specifically in relation to Mutunus and in general asserting that "Arnobius commits the same mistake as other Fathers of applying Christian conceptions to pagan ideas in order to condemn them" (p. 1010). "Our knowledge of such things," that is, of rites such as those of Mutunus, "comes from Christian writers who are openly concerned to discredit all aspects of pagan idolatry," states Peter Stewart, ''Statues in Roman Society: Representation and Response'' (Oxford University Press, 2003), p. 266, note 24 [https://books.google.com/books?id=xauWDEbWMs8C&amp;pg=PA266&amp;dq=%22Our+knowledge+of+such+things+comes+from+Christian+writers+who+are+openly%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Our%20knowledge%20of%20such%20things%20comes%20from%20Christian%20writers%20who%20are%20openly%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Unlike Priapus, who is depicted in human form with an outsized [[erection]], Mutunus seems to have been embodied purely by the phallus, like the ''[[fascinus]]'' or the mysterious begetter of [[Servius Tullius]]. The god's name is related to two infrequently recorded slang words for penis in Latin, ''mūtō'' (or ''muttō'') and ''mūtōnium''.&lt;ref&gt;J.N. Adams, ''The Latin Sexual Vocabulary'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1982, 1990), p. 62 [https://books.google.com/books?id=GDP9VHGbF1AC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=%22Mutunus+Tutunus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mutunus%20Tutunus%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; "Mutto" was also used as a ''[[cognomen]]'', the third of the [[Roman naming convention|three elements of a Roman man's name]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' V.1412, 8473, as cited by Adams. The moneyer Quintus Titius, one of whose coins has been interpreted as depicting Mutunus, may have used the ''cognomen'' Mutto; [[T.R.S. Broughton]], ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic'' (American Philological Association, 1952), vol. 2, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaius Lucilius|Lucilius]] offers the earliest recorded instance of both forms: ''at laeva lacrimas muttoni&lt;ref&gt;''Muttōni'' is the [[dative case|dative]] form of ''muttō''.&lt;/ref&gt; absterget amica'' ("A girlfriend wipes away Mutto's tears — his left hand, that is"),&lt;ref&gt;Lucilius 307 and 959. Kirk Freundenburg has dubbed the ''muttō'' of Lucilius "clearly the least finicky of all personified penises in Roman satire": ''Satires of Rome: Threatening Poses from Lucilius to Juvenal'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 205 [https://books.google.com/books?id=QzOjItakZRoC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=muttonis&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=muttonis&amp;f=false  online.] The left hand was preferred for masturbation by the Romans; see Antonio Varone, ''Erotica pompeiana: Love Inscriptions on the Walls of Pompeii'' («L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 2002), p. 95 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vg9h-tW4KikC&amp;dq=insula+felicula&amp;q=%22To+grasp+the+meaning+of+the+text%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22To%20grasp%20the%20meaning%20of%20the%20text%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the derivative ''mūtōnium''. ''Mūtōnium'' may have replaced the earlier form, as it appears later among the [[Graffito (archaeology)|graffiti of Pompeii]].&lt;ref&gt;''CIL'' IV.1939, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horace]] has a dialogue with his ''muttō'': "What do you want? Surely you're not demanding a grand [[Roman consul|consul]]'s granddaughter as a cunt?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace]], ''[[Satires (Horace)|Sermones]]'' 1.2.68.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Lucilius and Horace thus personify the ''muttō''.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''Latin Sexual Vocabulary'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mūtūniātus'', used by [[Martial]] and in the ''[[Priapeia|Corpus Priapeorum]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Martial]], ''Epigrams'' 3.73.1 and 11.63.2; [[Corpus Priapeorum]] 52.10.&lt;/ref&gt; describes a "well-endowed" male.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Arthur Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality: Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity'' (Oxford University Press, 1990), p. 92 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Kf4cs5Y0fiIC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=%22Mutinus+Titinus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mutinus%20Titinus%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both parts of the name ''Mūtūnus Tūtūnus'' are [[reduplicative]], ''Tītīnus'' perhaps from ''tītus'', another slang word for "penis."&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''Latin Sexual Vocabulary'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult==
The shrine of Mutunus Tutunus on the Velia has not been located. According to Festus, it was destroyed to make a private [[Roman bath|bath]] for the ''[[College of Pontiffs|pontifex]]'' and [[Augustus|Augustan]] supporter [[Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus|Domitius Calvinus]], even though it was revered as among the most ancient landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] 142L, as cited and discussed by Lawrence Richardson, ''A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 262 [https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;id=K_qjo30tjHAC&amp;dq=%22Mutinus+Titinus%22&amp;q=mutunus#v=snippet&amp;q=mutunus&amp;f=false online.] See also [[Ronald Syme]], ''The Augustan Aristocracy'' (Oxford University Press, 1989), p. 6 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fj8oQ4lzteIC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=%22Mutunus+Tutunus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=19#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mutunus%20Tutunus%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

This uprooting raises the question of why Calvinus was permitted to displace such a venerable shrine. The Church Fathers associate Mutunus with groupings of other deities that are assumed to be based on the lost theological works of [[Varro]]. Through examining these connections, [[R. E. A. Palmer|Robert Palmer]] concluded that the old cult of Mutunus was merged with that of [[Liber|Father Liber]], who was variously identified with or shared attributes with [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Bacchus (mythology)|Bacchus]], and [[Priapus#Worship and attributes|Lampsacene Priapus]]. Palmer further conjectured that it was Mutunus, in the form of Liber, to whom [[Julius Caesar]] made sacrifice on the [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|day of his assassination]], receiving the ill [[omen]]s that the conspirator [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus|Decimus Brutus]] urged him to ignore. Caesar had previously celebrated his victory at the [[Battle of Munda]] on the [[Liberalia]], or festival of Liber held March 17, and he visited the house of the ''pontifex'' Calvinus on the [[Ides of March]], near the archaic shrine of Mutunus-Liber. In Palmer's view, the evident ill favor of the god gave [[Augustus]] license to reform the cult during his program of religious revivalism that often disguised radical innovations. The god was then [[Hellenized]] as [[Dionysus#Appellations|Bacchus Lyaeus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[R. E. A. Palmer|Robert E.A. Palmer]], "Mutinus Titinus: A Study in Etrusco-Roman Religion and Topography," in ''Roman Religion and Roman Empire: Five Essays'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1974), pp. 187–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmer concurred with [[Numismatics|numismatists]] who regard a [[denarius]] minted by [[Titia (gens)|Quintus Titius]], [[moneyer]] ''ca.'' 90–88 BC, as picturing an aged and bearded Mutunus on its [[obverse and reverse|obverse]].&lt;ref&gt;The identification dates back at least to Ch. Lenormant, "Types des médailles romaines," ''Revue numismatique'' (1838), pp. 11–12 [https://books.google.com/books?id=dnjRAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22Mutinus+Titinus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=17#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mutinus%20Titinus%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The winged diadem is a reference to the Priapus of Lampsacus and to the winged phallus as a common motif in Roman decorative arts, which can also serve as an [[apotropaic]] charm against the [[evil eye]]. Another issue by Titius pictures an ivy-crowned Bacchus, with both denarii having a virtually identical [[Pegasus]] on the reverse. [[Michael Crawford (historian)|Michael Crawford]] finds "no good grounds" for identifying this figure as Mutunus,&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Crawford (historian)|Michael Crawford]], ''Roman Republican Coinage'' (Cambridge University Press, 1974, 2001), vol. 1, pp. 344 and 346 [https://books.google.com/books?id=NuBION2KtM4C&amp;pg=PA346&amp;dq=%22Mutunus+Tutunus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=18#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mutunus%20Tutunus%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; but Palmer points to the shared [[iconography]] of the Bacchus–Liber–Priapus figure and the associative [[etymology]] of the ''[[gens]]'' name Titius. A ''titus'' ("penis") with wings was a visual pun, since the word also referred to a type of bird.&lt;ref name=satire&gt;[[Scholiast]] on [[Persius]], ''Satire'' 1.20; Adams, ''Latin Sexual Vocabulary'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Varro seems to have associated ''Titinus'' with the [[Titii]], in an etymological collocation that included [[Titus Tatius]], the royal [[Sabine]] contemporary of [[Romulus]]; the [[Curia]] Titia; or the ''[[Tribal Assembly|tribus]]'' of the [[Tribe#Etymology|Titienses]], one of the three original tribes of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, "Mutinus Titinus," p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarwark was elected as Libertarian National Committee chair by the delegates of the 2014 [[Libertarian National Convention]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]] on June 29, 2014, defeating incumbent chairman [[Geoff Neale]] who had served two non-consecutive terms as chair of the LNC.&lt;ref name="twt"/&gt; He was re-elected as chairman of the Libertarian National Committee at the [[Libertarian National Convention]] in [[2016 Libertarian National Convention|2016]] and again in [[2018 Libertarian National Convention|2018]].

He was a deputy [[public defender]] in the state of [[Colorado]]. He is also a businessman with experience in computer consulting and sales.&lt;ref name="wt"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Sarwark formerly resided in [[Denver]], with his wife and three children,&lt;ref name="wt"/&gt; where he served as vice chair of the [[Colorado Libertarian Party]].&lt;ref name="lpmd"&gt;"[http://lpmaryland.org/news-2014-libertarian-national-convention/ News from 2014 Libertarian Party National Convention]," lpmaryland.org (1 July 2014, updated 27 August 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; Before that, he lived in [[Maryland]], where he served as chair of the [[Libertarian Party of Maryland]].&lt;ref name="lpmd" /&gt;

==Controversies==
===Feud with Mises Institute===
Sarwark faced criticism in August 2017 when he attacked the [[Mises Institute|Ludwig von Mises Institute]] and [[Thomas E. Woods|Tom Woods]] on [[Twitter]] for reviving [[Murray Rothbard]]'s strategy to rally the [[right-wing populism|populist]] and anti-establishment [[right-wing politics|Right]] behind [[paleolibertarianism]], an [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] movement aimed at [[cultural conservatism|preserving]] traditionally [[Western culture|Western]], [[European Americans|European-American]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejacknews.com/politics/political-highlights/flame-war-tom-woods-nick-sarwark-libertarian-purge-racists/|title=Flame War Rages Between Tom Woods And Nick Sarwark Over Libertarian Party Purge of Racists|date=September 7, 2017|accessdate=October 28, 2017|work=TheJackNews}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarwark also criticized Woods and the Mises Institute for failing to dissociate from and denounce the support of [[far-right politics|far-right]] individuals, especially [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]], after a fatal [[Unite the Right rally|white nationalist rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqhnkzp5lN4|title=646: Nick Sarwark Talks About the LP, White Nationalism, and Tom Woods|date=August 31, 2017|accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stratfor conspiracy===

'''Orok''' is the Russian name for the language known by its speakers as '''Uilta''', '''Ulta''', or '''Ujlta'''. Similarly, the people are called [[Orok people|Oroks or Ulta]]. It is a [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic language]]. The language is spoken in the Poronaysky and Nogliksky [[Administrative divisions of Sakhalin Oblast|Administrative Divisions]] of [[Sakhalin Oblast]], in the [[Russian Federation]].

According to the [[Russian Census (2002)|2002 Russian census]] there were 346 Oroks living in Russia, of whom 64 were competent in Orok. By the 2010 census, that number had dropped to 47. Oroks also live on the island of [[Hokkaido]] in Japan, but the number of speakers is uncertain, and certainly small.&lt;ref&gt;Novikova, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two dialects of Orok: northern (east Sakhalin) and southern (poronaysky). The variety of the language spoken on the island of Hokkaido belongs to the southern dialect.

Orok is used conversationally in everyday situations by the members of the older generation. It is also the language of oral folk literature. Oroks also speak Russian.

An alphabetic script, based on Cyrillic, was introduced in 2007. A primer has been published, and the language is taught in one school on the island of [[Sakhalin]].

==General information==

Orok is a [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic language]] that is spoken in areas of [[Sakhalin]], [[Russia]] and [[Hokkaido]], [[Japan]]. Its language code is 'oaa'. Orok is also known as Ulta, Ujlta, Uilta, and Sprache der Oroken. Currently it can be classified as a moribund or critically endangered language. The 2010 census reported 47 Orok people who are able to speak Orok competently. Furthermore, in a paper by Yoshiko Yamada in 2010, it is stated that there are 10 active speakers, 16 conditionally bilingual speakers, and 24 passive speakers who can understand with the help of Russian. The article states that "It is
highly probable that the number has since decreased further."&lt;ref name= yamada&gt;Yamada, Yoshiko, 2010: "A Preliminary Study of Language Contacts around Uilta in Sakhalin". Hokkaido University.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==

The language of '''Orok''' is classified as a [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic language]]. More specifically, it is classified as a Southern Tungusic language and Amur Tungusic language.

== Etymology ==

The Orok language is also known as the Uilta language. While they are called the Oroks by their neighbors in the Sakhalin such as the [[Ainu people|Ainu]], [[Nivkh people|Nivkh]], Japanese, and the Russians, these people prefer ''uil'ta~ul'ta''. The word ''Uilta'' may come from the word ''ulaa'' which means 'domestic reindeer'. This makes sense as the main occupation of the Orok people is reindeer herding.&lt;ref name=toshiro&gt;Tsumagari, Toshiro, 2009: "Grammatical Outline of Uilta (Revised)". Hokkaido University&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==

In efforts to preserve the Orok language and educate, many researchers have come up with dictionaries and lexical documentations. In 2008, the first Uilta primer was published to set a writing system and to educated local speakers of Uilta.&lt;ref name=toshiro/&gt;

==Geographic distribution==

The Orok/Uilta people mainly are located in the north-eastern part of Sakhalin. Orok has two dialects: Northern (east Sakhalin) and Southern (poronaysky). The geographic distribution determines which dialect is spoken. Also, the few Orok speakers in Hokkaido speak the southern dialect. "The distribution of Uilta is closely connected with their half-nomadic lifestyle, which involves reindeer herding as a subsistence economy."&lt;ref name=yamada /&gt;

===Dialects/Varieties===

The Southern Orok people stay in the coastal Okhotsk area in the Spring and Summer, and move to the North Sakhalin plains and East Sakhalin mountains during the Fall and Winter. The Northern Orok people live near the Terpenija Bay and the Poronai River during Spring and Summer, and migrate to the East Sakhalin mountains in the Fall and Winter.

[[File:Copper - world production trend.svg|thumb|right|300px|World copper production, 1900–2012]]

'''Peak copper''' is the point in time at which the maximum global [[copper]] production rate is reached. Since copper is a finite resource, at some point in the future new production from mining will diminish, and at some earlier time production will reach a maximum. When this will occur is a matter of dispute. Unlike [[fossil fuel]]s, copper is [[scrap]]ped and reused and it has been estimated that at least 80% of all copper ever mined is still available (having been repeatedly recycled).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copperinfo.com/environment/recycling.html Copper Alliance | Our mission is to defend and grow markets for copper based on its superior technical performance and its contribution to a higher quality of life worldwide]. Copperinfo.com. Retrieved on 14 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Copper is among the most important industrial metals, valued for its heat and electrical conductivities and malleability. Copper is used in electrical power cables, data cables, electrical equipment, cooling and refrigeration tubing, [[heat exchangers]], [[brass]] casing small arms [[ammunition]], water pipes, and [[jewellery]].{{cn|date=December 2016}}

Copper has been used at least 10,000 years. More than 97% of all copper ever mined and smelted has been extracted since 1900. The increased demand for copper due to the growing Indian and Chinese economies since 2006 has led to increased prices and an increase in [[Metal theft|copper theft]].&lt;ref name=Leonard2006&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2006/03/02/peak_copper/ |title=Peak copper? |work=Salon|author=Leonard, Andrew |date=2 March 2006 |accessdate=23 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Concern about the copper supply is not new.  In 1924 geologist and copper-mining expert [[Ira Joralemon]] warned:
:"... the age of electricity and of copper will be short.  At the intense rate of production that must come, the copper supply of the world will last hardly a score of years. ... Our civilization based on electrical power will dwindle and die."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Copper and electricity to vanish in twenty years?|journal=Engineering and Mining Journal|date=26 July 1924|volume=118|issue=4|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copper demand==
Total world production is about 18 million [[metric ton]]s per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/copper/ Copper Statistics and Information, Mineral Commodity Summaries, 2014], USGS{{nonspecific|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copper demand is increasing by more than 575,000 tons annually and accelerating.&lt;ref name=Leonard2006/&gt; Based on 2006 figures for per capita consumption, Tom Graedel and colleagues at Yale University calculate that by 2100 global demand for copper will outstrip the amount extractable from the ground.&lt;!-- (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, vol 103, p 1209) --&gt;&lt;ref name=Cohen2007&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/027ns_005.htm?id=mg19426051.200&amp;print=true |title=Earth's natural wealth: an audit |issue=2605 |pages=34–41 |journal=[[New Scientist]] |author=David Cohen |date=23 May 2007 |accessdate=9 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720095945/http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/027ns_005.htm?id=mg19426051.200&amp;print=true |archivedate=20 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; China accounted for more than 22% of world copper demand in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/20/internationalcrime |title=Deaths and disruption as price rise sees copper thefts soar |work=[[The Guardian]] |author1=Glaister, Dan |author2=Branigan, Tania |author3=Bowcott, Owen  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=20 March 2008 |accessdate=9 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is nearly 40% in 2014.

For some purposes, other metals can substitute, [[aluminium wire]] was substituted in many applications, but improper design resulted in fire hazards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpsc.gov//PageFiles/118856/516.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The safety issues have since been solved by use of larger sizes of aluminium wire (#8AWG and up), and properly designed aluminium wiring is still being installed in place of copper. For example, the [[Airbus A380]] uses aluminum wire in place of copper wire for electrical power transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/aviation/manufacturing-mayday |title=Manufacturing Mayday: Production glitches send Airbus into a tailspin |work=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |author=Hellemans, Alexander |date=1 January 2007 |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copper supply==
[[File:2012copper (mined).svg|thumb|300px|right]]
Globally, economic copper resources are being depleted with the equivalent production of three world-class copper mines being consumed annually.&lt;ref name=Leonard2006/&gt;  Environmental analyst [[Lester Brown]] suggested in 2008 that copper might run out within 25 years based on what he considered a reasonable extrapolation of 2% growth per year.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Lester |title=Plan B 2.0: Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble |publisher=W.W.

===New copper discoveries===
Fifty-six new copper discoveries have been made during the three decades 1975–2005.&lt;ref name=Leonard2006/&gt; World discoveries of new copper deposits are said to have peaked in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.silverseek.com/CharlestonVoice/1135873932.php |title=Peak Copper Means Peak Silver |work=Charleston Voice |date=29 December 2005 |accessdate=9 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104020042/http://news.silverseek.com/CharlestonVoice/1135873932.php |archivedate=4 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), remaining world copper reserves have more than doubled since then, from 310 million metric tons in 1996&lt;ref&gt;US Geological Survey, [http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/copper/240397.pdf Mineral commodity summaries], 1997, p.53.&lt;/ref&gt; to 690 million metric tons in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;US Geological Survey, [http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/copper/mcs-2014-coppe.pdf Mineral commodity summaries], 1997, p.49.&lt;/ref&gt;

As shown in the table below, the three chief national producers of copper, respectively, in 2002, were Chile, Indonesia, and the [[Copper mining in the United States|United States]]. In 2013, they were Chile, China, and Peru. Twenty-one of the 28 largest copper mines in the world are not amenable to expansion.&lt;ref name=Leonard2006/&gt; Many large copper mines will be exhausted between 2010 and 2015.&lt;ref name=Leonard2006/&gt;

===Reserves===
Copper is a [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|fairly common]] element, with an estimated concentration of 50–70 ppm (0.005–0.007 percent) in earth's crust (1&amp;nbsp;kg of copper per 15–20 tons of crustal rock).&lt;ref name=emsley&gt;{{cite book|author=Emsley, John|title=Nature's building blocks: an A–Z guide to the elements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC&amp;pg=PA123|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-850340-8|pages=121–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; A concentration of 60 ppm would multiply out to 1.66 quadrillion [[tonne]]s over the 2.77e22 kg mass of the crust,&lt;ref&gt;American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2007, abstract #V33A-1161.

====Known conventional resources====
====Recycling====
In the US, more copper is recovered and put back into service from recycled material than is derived from newly-mined ore. Copper's recycle value is so great that premium-grade scrap normally has at least 95% of the value of primary metal from newly mined ore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copper.org/education/history/g_fact_future.html |title=Copper in the USA: Bright Future – Glorious Past |publisher=[[Copper Development Association]] |accessdate=9 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Asof|2011}}, recycled copper provided 35% of total worldwide copper usage.&lt;ref&gt;International Copper Study Group, [http://www.icsg.org/index.php/component/jdownloads/finish/170/1188 World Copper Factbook 2013], p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Undiscovered conventional resources====
Based on discovery rates and existing geologic surveys, researchers estimated in 2006 that 1.6 billion metric tons of copper could be brought into use. This figure relied on the broadest possible definition of available copper as well as a lack of energy constraints and environmental concerns.&lt;ref name=Biello2006/&gt;

The US Geological Survey estimated that, as of 2013, there remained 3.5 billion metric tons of undiscovered copper resources worldwide in porphyry and sediment-hosted type deposits, two types which currently provide 80% of mined copper production.  This was in addition to 2.1 billion metric tons of identified resources. Combined identified and estimated undiscovered copper resources were 5.6 billion metric tons,&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen M. Johnson and others, [http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2014/3004/pdf/fs2014-3004.pdf Estimate of undiscovered copper resources of the world, 2013], US Geological Survey, Fact Sheet 2014–3004, Jan. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 306 times the 2013 global production of newly mined copper of 18.3 million metric tons.

===Unconventional resources===
Deep-sea nodules are estimated to contain 700 million tonnes of copper.&lt;ref name=USGS2008/&gt;

==Politics==

===Chile===
Chile is the world's largest copper producer, and in 2007 accounted for 37% of the world's primary copper production. One researcher wrongfully claimed that Chilean copper production would begin to decline irreversibly in 2008.&lt;ref name=Leonard2006/&gt; This was contradicted by the Chilean Copper Commission, which projected that, based on planned expansion projects, Chilean copper production will continue to increase through at least 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080516051205/http://www.icsg.org/conferences/Sep_06_meeting_Cochilco_Presentation.pdf Chilean Copper Commission (Sept. 2006): ''Current and future situation of the copper industry in Chile'']. icsg.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zaire===
In [[Zaire]], copper production fell 90% from 1976 (502,000 tons) to wartime 1993 (50,000 tons). Resumption depends on political factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Hornet/irin_2277.html |title=Zaire: IRIN Briefing Part II |publisher=[[University Of Pennsylvania]] |date=27 February 1997 |accessdate=9 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

==Criticism==
[[Julian Lincoln Simon|Julian Simon]] was a senior fellow at the [[Cato Institute]] and a professor of business and economics. In his book ''[[The Ultimate Resource|The Ultimate Resource 2]]'' (first printed in 1981 and reprinted in 1998), he extensively criticizes the notion of "peak resources", and uses copper as one example. He argues that, even though "peak copper" has been a persistent scare since the early 20th century, "known reserves" grew at a rate that outpaced demand, and the price of copper was not rising but falling over the long run. For example, even though world production of copper in 1950 was only one-eighth of what it was in early-2000s, known reserves were also much lower at the time – around 100 million metric tons – making it appear that the world would run out of copper in 40 to 50 years at most.

Simon's own explanation for this development is that the very notion of known reserves is deeply flawed,&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Julian (16 February 1998) [http://www.juliansimon.com/writings/Ultimate_Resource/TCHAR12.txt Chapt 12, "People, Materials, and Environment"] in ''The Ultimate Resource II''.&lt;/ref&gt; as it does not take into account changes in mining profitability. As richer mines are exhausted, developers turn their attention to poorer sources of the element and eventually develop cheap methods of extracting it, raising known reserves. Thus, for example, copper was so abundant 5000 years ago, occurring in pure form as well as in highly concentrated copper ores, that prehistoric peoples were able to collect and process it with very basic technology. As of the early 21st century, copper is commonly mined from ores that contain 0.3% to 0.6% copper by weight. Yet, despite the material being far less widespread, the cost of, for example, a copper pot was vastly lower in the late 20th century than 5000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Julian (16 February 1998) [http://www.juliansimon.com/writings/Ultimate_Resource/ ''The Ultimate Resource II'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon essentially states that not all viable copper has been discovered and that not all technological advancements in mining and refining have occurred, so statements that the point of peak copper has been or will be reached must be false. Simon supports his argument by showing that copper supplies have increased and prices have fallen. Simon's thesis of peak resources is not based on current scientific analysis or geological measurements, but the analysis of historical trends and the assumption that they can and will continue.

'''Robert Francis Van Wisse''' (born February 3, 1965)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/new-top-ten-fugitive-terry-ad-strickland|title=Wanted by the FBI: New Top Ten Fugitive Robert Francis Van Wisse|publisher=FBI|accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American criminal who was added to the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]] list in December 2016, in relation to a sexual assault and murder in [[Austin, Texas]] in September 1983. In January 2017, he surrendered to U.S. officials. On March 28, 2017, Van Wisse pled guilty to murder and was sentenced to 30 years in prison.

==Crime==
On September 19, 1983, Laurie Stout, who owned a janitorial service in Austin with her husband, went into a building which she was hired to clean. Her body was found at 8:30 am the following morning in the second floor men's bathroom where she was working. She had been sexually assaulted and murdered.&lt;ref name="upi"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stephen|first1=Feller|title=Fugitive on FBI 'most wanted' list for '83 Texas murder surrenders|url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2017/01/26/Fugitive-on-FBI-most-wanted-list-for-83-Texas-murder-surrenders/1341485478428/|accessdate=18 September 2017|work=UPI|publisher=United Press International, Inc.|date=26 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Austin Police Department]] later ruled Stout’s death was a homicide due to strangulation and [[asphyxia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff|title=FBI: Man wanted in strangling of Austin mother more than 30 years ago|url=https://cw39.com/2016/12/13/fbi-man-wanted-in-strangling-death-of-austin-mother-more-than-30-years-ago/|accessdate=18 September 2017|work=CW39 NewsFix|publisher=KIAH • A TRIBUNE BROADCASTING STATION|date=13 December 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Everyone who was in the building that evening was questioned, including 18-year-old Van Wisse, who was late registering for a class at the [[University of Texas]] at the time. He was given [[fingerprinting]] and [[DNA testing]], and ruled out as a suspect at the time due to the under developed DNA technology in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Catherine|first1=Townsend|title=Texas Man Charged With Strangling Young Mother To Death In 1983 Makes FBI's Ten Most Wanted List - CrimeFeed|url=http://crimefeed.com/2016/12/27437/|website=CrimeFeed|publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC.|accessdate=18 September 2017|language=en|date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Cold case investigation===
In 1992, an investigator was hired to reopen the cold case. She found that the 1983 testing of Van Wisse's DNA was misleading due to outdated technology, and after reevaluation he was determined to be the prime suspect.&lt;ref name="kxan" /&gt;

On October 3, 1996, a state arrest warrant was issued for Van Wisse in [[Travis County, Texas]], after he was charged in Stout's murder. On March 6, 1997, Van Wisse was also charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution and a Federal arrest warrant was issued for Van Wisse by the [[United States District Court]] in Austin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former UT student linked to 1983 killing added to FBI Most Wanted list|url=http://www.kvue.com/news/local/former-ut-student-linked-to-1983-killing-added-to-fbi-list/369490807|accessdate=18 September 2017|work=KVUE-ABC|publisher=KVUE-TV, A TEGNA Company|date=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 13, 2016, Van Wisse became the 511th person added to the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, with a $100,000 reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten/robert-francis-van-wisse|title=Van Wisse's FBI Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitive Alert|publisher=FBI|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kxan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bien|first1=Calily|last2=Glas|first2=Brittany|title=1983 Austin murder suspect added to FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted list|url=http://kxan.com/2016/12/13/fbi-in-austin-looking-for-texans-on-top-10-most-wanted-list/|accessdate=December 18, 2016|work=KXAN}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 26, 2017, he surrendered to U.S. officials in [[Laredo, Texas]] at the Mexican border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Villalpando|first1=Roberto|last2=Hall|first2=Katie|title=Fugitive in 1983 Austin cold case surrenders to authorities|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/local/fugitive-1983-austin-cold-case-surrenders-authorities/LscSphQPN5cpUDNHzexFlK/|accessdate=January 27, 2017|work=Austin American-Statesman|publisher=Nexstar Broadcasting|date=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=CRIMESIDER STAFF|title=FBI "10 Most Wanted" fugitive, wanted in 1983 slaying, turns self in|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/robert-van-wisse-fbi-10-most-wanted-fugitive-wanted-in-1983-slaying-turns-self-in/|accessdate=18 September 2017|work=CBS/AP|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|date=27 January 2017|location=AUSTIN, Texas|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Floralia in Aquincum.JPG|thumb|Ceremony of the Roman revivalist group [[Nova Roma]] to [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]] at [[Aquincum]] (Budapest), [[Floralia]] 2008]]
'''Roman Polytheistic Reconstructionism''', known variously as '''Religio Romana''' (''Roman religion'') in [[Latin]], the '''Roman Way to the Gods''' in [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (''via romana agli dei'' and ''camino romano a los dioses'', respectively), and '''Cultus Deorum Romanorum''' (''care of the Gods''), is a contemporary [[polytheistic reconstructionism|reconstructionist]] movement reviving [[religion in ancient Rome|traditional Roman]] religious [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]]s consisting of loosely related organizations.

Adherents can be found across [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin Europe]], but also in the [[Americas]], the latter exemplified by [[Nova Roma]], the largest such reconstructionist organisation.&lt;ref&gt;George D. Chryssides, ''Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements'' (2011, 2nd ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; While an international organisation, it is legally based in the United States, with a majority of its membership hailing from the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. Religious activity in Nova Roma, however, is also especially active in [[Central Europe]], and countries such as [[Hungary]], as well as [[Eastern Europe]], particularly [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]]. Additional organizations have become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly the Roman Republic: Res Publica Romana organization. &lt;ref&gt;Gaius Glenn Atkins, ''Modern Religious Movements'' (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

As usually grouped in Italian literature, the Italian movements may not correspond precisely with the English-literature notion of reconstructionism, but to a more encompassing notion of "Roman Pagan tradition[alism]".&lt;ref&gt;Del Ponte, «Le correnti della tradizione pagana romana in Italia», Algiza, 7 (aprile 1997), pp. 4-8. [http://www.centrostudilaruna.it/delponte.html web version]&lt;/ref&gt; Loosely influenced by [[Julius Evola]] and [[Arturo Reghini]]'s [[Ur Group]] of the 1920s, various other groups have appeared in Italy, most notably the ''Movimento Tradizionale Romano'' and ''Curia Romana Patrum'' in the 1980s, which unified some calendars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Sedgwick]], ''Against the Modern World:  Traditionalism and the Secret Intellectual History of the Twentieth Century'', (2004) p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; Among the successes of the movement in Italy are two marriages: one in 1989 and one in 1992. [[CESNUR]] maintains a page with various other organizations and their history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/religioni_italia/n/neo_paganesimo_04.htm Il tradizionalismo romano]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''SEC Classification''' is the classification of Indian consumers on the basis of parameters. Traditionally the two parameters used to categorize consumers were: Occupation and Education of the chief wage earner (Head) of the households.The SEC classification,created in 1988, was ratified by Market Research Society of India (MRSI), is used by most media researchers and brand managers to understand the Indian consuming class.Originally developed by [[IMRB International]] as a way of understanding [[market segment]]s, and [[consumer behavior]] it was standardized and adopted by the Market Research Society of India in the mid-1980s as a measure of socio-economic class and is now commonly used as a [[market segmentation]] tool in India.

In the older version,the SEC Classification consists of two grids-

* The [[urban area|Urban]] SEC Grid, which uses [[Literacy|Education]] levels and [[Job (role)|Occupational]] criteria of the Chief Wage Earner (CWE) of a household as measures to determine socio-economic classification, and segments urban India into 7 groups (A1 to E2) and
* The [[Rural]] SEC Grid, which uses [[Literacy|Education]] and Type of House (pucca, semi-pucca, and katcha) as measures of socio-economic class, and segments rural India into 4 groups (R1,R2,R3,R4)

This is based on the assumption that higher education leads to higher income thus higher consuming potential. But we know that this may not be true always. A trader or a retailer with no qualification can earn more income than a Post graduate executive, but SEC will categorize the traders/retailers not as SEC A1or A2.

So, in order to combat this problem, the Government came up with the new SEC system on 3 May 2011.

'''The new SEC system is based on two variables:'''

'''1. Education of the Chief Earner.''' The options are Illiterate, Literate but no formal schooling or Schooling unto 4 years, Schooling between 5–9 years, High School pass, Some college (including a diploma but not a graduate), Graduate / Post Graduate (General), Graduate / Post Graduate (Professional)

'''2. The number of Consumer durables(pre-decided from a list of 11 items) owned by the family'''. The list of 11 items are:  Electricity Connection, Ceiling Fan, LPG Stove, Two Wheeler, Color TV, Refrigerator, Washing Machine, Personal Computer/Laptop, Car/Jeep/Van, Air Conditioner, Agricultural Land

There are 12 grades in the new system starting from A1 to E3.

These grids are used to determine the consumption preferences, and purchasing power of households, and are common tools used by social and business researchers working in India. The SEC grid does not use family income levels as a measure as this data is hard to collect and it has been demonstrated that education levels and occupation criteria in India are better determinants of consumer preference. The methodology used in these tools differs from the [[Household Potential Index]], which measures consumption intensity.

==Urban SEC Grid (old version)==

It divides the population into 3 classes:

* Upper most segment of the consuming class-A1,A2 and B1
* Middle segment- B2 and C
* The lower most segment—D, E1, and E2..

By 2017 there were an estimated 40,000 small scale projects, 1,400 sustained projects, and 135 Bahá'í inspired organizations.&lt;ref name="betterment"&gt;Bahá’í Office of Social and Economic Development (2018).

==Historical development==
The accelerated growth of the worldwide community in the 1960s-1980s expanded it with a large number of poor, illiterate villagers and tribal peoples in India, Africa and South America, which meant an enormous challenge for the social and economic development of communities. According to the [[Bahá'í teachings]], development should increase people’s self-reliance, communal solidarity, giving access to knowledge, and, where possible, removing sources of injustice. Spiritual, moral and material development should be linked together.&lt;ref name="momen-2007"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Momen |first= Moojan|authorlink= Moojan Momen |encyclopedia= New Lion Handbook: The World's Religions |title= The Bahá’í Faith |year= 2007 |publisher= Lion Hudson Plc |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-0-7459-5266-6 |page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt; These priorities are envisioned as crucial to the development of world peace.

The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the [[Universal House of Justice]] dated 20 October 1983 was released.&lt;ref name="survey"&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Baha'i Faith 1957–1988: A Survey of Contemporary Developments | first = Moojan | last = Momen |authorlink= Moojan Momen|author2=Smith, Peter  | year = 1989 | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_smith_developments_1957-1988 |volume = 19 | journal = Religion | pages=63–91 |doi= 10.1016/0048-721X(89)90077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Universal House of Justice]] (20 October 1983). ''[http://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/the-universal-house-of-justice/messages/#d=19831020_001&amp;f=f1-2 To the Bahá’ís of the World]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Office of Social and Economic Development was established&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Smith | first = Peter| authorlink= Peter Smith (historian)

Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socioeconomic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.&lt;ref name="survey" /&gt;

In time with the release of the Universal House of Justice's release of its statement ''[[The Promise of World Peace]]'', it also sent a letter of all national assemblies to specify goals for the community for the [[International Year of Peace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Make plans now for 'Peace Year 1986'|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1985 | number = 648|ISSN=0195-9212 | page =1 |url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These goals included sponsoring activities about the theme of peace which is a priority of the religion: to engage the attention of people to relevant topics related to peace (often related matters of justice and development) and the [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of humanity]].

==Current situation==
The Bahá'ís around the world are currently being encouraged to focus on capacity building through activities such as spiritual education of children, a youth empowerment program, [[Bahá'í study circle|study circles]], and devotional gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Gervais |first=Marie |date=2008 |title=Baha’i Faith and Peace Education |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Peace Education |publisher=Teachers College, Columbia University |location=New York |url=http://www.tc.columbia.edu/epe/epe-entries/GervaisBahaiFaith_22feb08.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=3 May 2018 |ref=harv |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of these activities, material developed by the [[Ruhi Institute]] is used.&lt;ref name=Blosson&amp;Kaye&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Rosemary Blosson |author2=Sylvia B Kaye | title =Learning by Doing: Preparation of Baha'i Nonformal Tutors | journal =New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education | volume =2012 | issue =133 | pages =45–57 | date =March 14, 2012 | url =http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ978367 | doi =10.1002/ace.20006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initiatives of social action include activities in areas like health, sanitation, education, gender equality, arts and media, agriculture, and the environment.&lt;ref name="betterment" /&gt; Educational projects include schools, which range from village tutorial schools to large secondary schools, and some universities.&lt;ref name="momen-2007" /&gt;

'''Turkish New Zealanders''' or '''New Zealand Turks''' are [[Turkish people]] who are [[New Zealanders|New Zealand citizens]], residents of [[New Zealand]], or people who are of Turkish descent. Most have come to [[New Zealand]] from [[Turkey]] and the island of [[Cyprus]]. In addition, there are also recent Turkish arrivals (mostly refugees) from [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]]. 

The Turkish people are one of the most visible immigrant groups from the Middle East. They operate their own businesses specialising in traditional [[Turkish food]], such as [[kebab]], [[baklava]], and [[Turkish delight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first1=James|last1=Veitch|first2=Dalia|last2=Tinawi|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/middle-eastern-peoples/page-4|encyclopedia=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|title=Other Middle Eastern peoples: The Turks and others|date=8 February 2005|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3927">The '''wealth effect''' is the change in spending that accompanies a change in perceived [[wealth]].&lt;ref&gt;• Darby, Michael R. (1987). "wealth effect," ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 4, pp. 883–4.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; •

&lt;/ref&gt;
Usually the wealth effect is positive: spending changes in the same direction as perceived wealth.

==Effect on individuals==
Changes in a [[consumer]]'s wealth cause changes in the amounts and distribution of his or her [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. People typically spend more overall when one of two things is true: when people ''actually are'' richer, objectively, or when people ''perceive themselves'' to be richer—for example, the assessed value of their [[Real estate pricing|home increases]], or a [[stock]] they own goes up in price.

Demand for some goods (called [[inferior good]]s) decreases with increasing wealth.  For example, consider consumption of cheap fast food versus steak.  As someone becomes wealthier, their demand for cheap fast food is likely to decrease, and their demand for more expensive steak may increase.

Consumption may be tied to relative wealth.  Particularly when supply is highly inelastic—or in the case of monopoly—one's ability to purchase a good may be highly related to one's relative wealth in the economy.  Consider for example
the cost of real estate in a city with high average wealth (for example New York or London), in comparison to a city
with a low average wealth.  Supply is fairly inelastic, so if a [[helicopter drop]] (or [[gold rush]]) were to suddenly
create large amounts of wealth in the low wealth city, those who did not receive this new wealth would rapidly find
themselves crowded out of such markets, and materially worse off in terms of their ability to consume/purchase real estate
(despite having participated in a weak [[Pareto improvement]]).  In such situations, one cannot dismiss the relative effect of
wealth on demand and supply, and cannot assume that these are static (see also [[General equilibrium]]).

However, according to [[David Backus]] the wealth effect is not observable in economic data, at least in regard to increases or decreases in home or stock equity.&lt;ref name=Flavelle/&gt; For example, while the [[stock market boom]] in the late 1990s (q.v. [[dot-com bubble]]) increased the wealth of Americans, it did not produce a significant change in consumption, and after the crash, consumption did not decrease.&lt;ref name=Flavelle&gt;{{cite web

Economist [[Dean Baker]] disagrees and says that “housing wealth effect” is well-known and is a standard part of economic theory and modeling, and that economists expect households to consume based on their wealth. He cites approvingly research done by Carroll and Zhou that estimates that households increase their annual consumption by 6 cents for every additional dollar of home equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
