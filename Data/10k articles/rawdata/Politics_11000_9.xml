      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3920">'''1832 Georgian plot''' ({{lang-ka|1832 წლის შეთქმულება}}) was a [[List of political conspiracies|conspiracy]] involving [[Georgians|Georgian]] [[royal family|royalty]] and [[nobility]] to restore [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[sovereign state|statehood]] and its [[Bagrationi dynasty]] [[monarchy]]. 

Eastern Georgia ([[Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti|Kartli-Kakheti]]) was [[Georgia within the Russian Empire|annexed]] by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1801, breaking the terms of the [[Treaty of Georgievsk]]. Members of the royal Bagrationi dynasty were deported to the Russian provinces, and Russian control was acknowledged in 1813 by the [[Treaty of Gulistan]]. The Georgians, unsatisfied with the Russian rule, yearned for the removal of Russian dominance and the return of their royal dynasty. The goal of independence was kept alive principally by [[Prince Okropir of Georgia]], a son of the last eastern Georgian monarch, [[George XII of Georgia|George XII]]. Okropir and other Georgians would hold gatherings of Georgian students in [[Moscow]] and [[St. Petersburg]], trying to inspire them with patriotic feeling towards their country under Russian rule. It resulted in creation of a secret society in [[Tbilisi]] whose main goal was the re-establishment of an independent kingdom under the dethroned Bagrationi. Okropir himself visited Georgia in 1830, and held talks with the principal conspirators, who included members of Georgian aristocrats from the [[Orbeliani]] and [[Eristavi]] princely houses, as well as the philosopher [[Solomon Dodashvili]]. The plot was also supported by the Georgians from western Georgia, i.e. from the Russian-abolished [[Kingdom of Imereti]] as well as the members of the [[House of Shervashidze]] that ruled [[Abkhazia]].

Most of the Georgian conspirators were not liberal republicans, but rather monarchists and nationalists. It was proposed to invite the Russian commander-in-chief in Georgia together with other members of their administration to a grand ball in Tbilisi and at a given signal they would all be assassinated. The Georgians would then seize the [[Darial Gorge|Daryal]] Pass to prevent Russian reinforcements, and [[Prince Aleksandre of Georgia]], son of the Georgian king [[Erekle II]] would return from [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]] to be proclaimed king of Georgia. 

The ball at which the Russian officers and administration members were to be killed was scheduled for 20 November 1832, but it was unexpectedly postponed, first to 9 December, then to 20 December. Early in December the whole affair was revealed to the authorities by one of the conspirators, Prince [[Palavandishvili]], and all of them were arrested. Ten of the accused conspirators were sentenced to death but later reprieved and deported to distant Russian provinces instead. The 1832 plot, though unsuccessful, would play an important role in the national liberation movement that Georgians would seek to organize more fruitfully. &lt;ref&gt;[[David Marshall Lang]] (1962) A Modern History of Georgia: ''Georgia under the Tsars: Resistance, Revolt, Pacification: 1801–32'' NY&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2929">'''1972 Language violence in Sindh''' occurred starting on 7 July, 1972 when the [[Sindh Assembly]] passed [[1972 Sindhi Language Bill|The Sind Teaching, Promotion and Use of Sindhi Language Bill, 1972]] which established [[Sindhi language]] as the sole official language of the province resulting in language violence in [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Was it a language issue"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proclamation of Sindhi as the official language of Sindh resulted in the ''[[Daily Jang]]'', a [[Urdu language|Urdu]] from Karachi, publishing a full-page story on their front page surrounded by a banner with the statement "Urdu ka janaza hai zara dhoom se nikle" (It is the funeral of Urdu thus should be a flaunting one) by [[Rais Amrohvi]].&lt;ref name="Language frenzy in Sindh"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the clashes, [[Prime minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] compromised and announced that Urdu and Sindhi will both be official languages of Sindh. The making of Sindhi as an equal language to Urdu for official purposes frustrated the Urdu-speaking people as they did not speak the Sindhi language.

In 1988 thousands of Sindhi killed by Mahajir qaomi Movement (MQM) Led by Mr Altaf Hussain.

In 2018 Cheif of the Army staff start operation against this organization and arrested terrorists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9746">The '''2002 Klamath River fish kill''' occurred on the [[Klamath River]] in [[California]] in September 2002. According to the official estimate of mortality, about 34,000 fish died. Though some counts may estimate over 70,000 adult [[chinook salmon]] (''Oncorhynchus tshawytscha'') were killed when returning to the river to spawn,&lt;ref name=RegisterGuard&gt;{{cite news |title=In Klamath Basin, politics trump science |author=Steve Pedery |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZF5WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=d_ADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4994,751693 |newspaper=[[The Register-Guard]] |date=2007-07-05 |accessdate=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the largest [[fish kill|salmon kill]] in the history of the [[Western United States]]. Besides the chinook salmon, other fish that perished include: [[steelhead]] (''O. mykiss''), coho salmon (''O. kisutch''), sculpins (''Cottus spp.''), speckled dace (''Rhinichthys osculus''), and Klamath smallscale sucker (''Catostomus rimiculus'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ph.D.|first1=George Gullen|title=Report on Estimate of Mortality|url=https://www.fws.gov/arcata/fisheries/reports/technical/Klamath_River_Dieoff_Mortality_Report_AFWO_01_03.pdf|publisher=Arcata: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services|date=November 7, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] found that the kill resulted from water diversions to [[Klamath Basin]] by farmers and ranchers during a drought year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Glen | last = Martin | title = Salmon kill linked to level of Klamath | date = 2003-11-19 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/11/19/MNGRC35FLQ1.DTL | work = San Francisco Chronicle | accessdate = 2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report found that the atypical low flow in the river along with high fish return numbers and high water temperatures allowed for a gill rot disease to kill at least 33,000&amp;nbsp;salmon in September 2002, before they could reproduce.  The die-off was downstream of the Trinity inflow, and the salmon of the Trinity were impacted to a greater degree than the Klamath as the Trinity run was at its peak. The report does mention that the official fish die-off estimate of 34,056 is probably quite low and could be only half of the actual loss. Klamath River flows as measured at the river gauge in Keno show a low flow of {{convert|800|cuft/s|m3/s|1}} in September 1908 (before irrigation began). During the 2002 fish kill, flows of {{convert|475|cuft/s|m3/s|1}} were recorded. During September of the 2001 irrigation shut-off, an average of {{convert|688|cuft/s|m3/s|1}} was recorded.&lt;ref name=kenostreamflow&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/annual?site_no=11512500&amp;amp;por_11512500_1=2210277,00060,1,1924,1961&amp;amp;year_type=W&amp;amp;format=html_table&amp;amp;date_format=YYYY-MM-DD&amp;amp;rdb_compression=file&amp;amp;submitted_form=parameter_selection_list|title=USGS Gage #11512500 on the Klamath River below Fall Creek near Copco (Average Annual Streamflow)|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|work=National Water Information System|accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lower water flows were decided on against the suggestions of higher water flows biologists had said would be needed to keep the fish safe from a die off.

In response to a 2007 ''[[Washington Post]]'' story critical of [[United States Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]]'s role in diverting water to farmers and ranchers for political gain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jo |last=Becker |author2=Barton Gellma |title=Leaving No Tracks |date=2007-06-27 |url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/cheney/chapters/leaving_no_tracks/index.html |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=2012-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515135939/http://blog.washingtonpost.com/cheney/chapters/leaving_no_tracks/index.html |archivedate=2008-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources|House Natural Resources Committee]] began an investigation into his role in instigating the fish kill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20070709/NEWS/707090313 |title=Cheney's role in fish kill probed 2002 Klamath River disaster| work=[[The Press Democrat]] |year=2007 |accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fish kill played an important role in stirring an effort by local [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] peoples, in concert with environmentalists and fishers, to [[dam removal|remove dams]] on the [[Klamath River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Steve | last = Hymon | title = Salmon Die-Off Reignites Feud Over Klamath River Water | date = 2002-09-25 | publisher = Oregon Wild | url = http://www.oregonwild.org/about/press-room/press-clips/salmon-die-off-reignites-feud-over-klamath-river-water/ | work = The Los Angeles Times | accessdate = 2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2009/09/the_klamath_river_will_dam_rem.html | title = The Klamath River: Will dam removal be enough to help fish? | accessdate = 2012-03-17 | last = Barnett | first = Galen | year = 2009 | publisher = The Oregonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement (KBRA) was carefully negotiated and signed by the tribes, the farmers, and PacifiCorp in 2010, but failed to pass through Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.northcoastjournal.com/NewsBlog/archives/2015/09/16/yurok-tribe-no-longer-supports-klamath-river-agreement|title=Yurok Tribe no Longer Supports Klamath River Agreement|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 6, 2016, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell, Yurok Tribal Chair Thomas P.

A play called ''Salmon is Everything'' was a collaboration between tribal members and Humboldt State University Theatre professor Theresa May to communicate the impact of the fish kill, featuring a cast which included people from the [[Hupa]], [[Karuk]], and [[Yurok people|Yurok]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://eugenedailynews.com/2011/05/19/salmon-is-everything-opens-friday/ | title = "Salmon Is Everything" Opens Friday | accessdate = 2012-03-17 | last = Valentine | first = Andy | date = 2012-03-16 | work = Eugene Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play presents the experience of the members of the Yurok, Hoopa Valley, and Karuk tribes, as well as farmers, ranchers, and others invested in the Klamath watershed. Karuk woman, Kathleen McCovey, provided the play with a spiritual perspective through an elder character, Rose. Rose's character demonstrates to the audience the intrinsic role salmon plays in Karuk and Yurok culture:

"Rose: ...You see, to the Karuk people everything and everyone has a purpose. The spirit people taught the Karuk how to live on the land, what to do, what to eat, how to behave, and how and when to conduct ceremonies. Then when the Karuk people knew what to do the spirit people went into the sky, the earth, the trees, the animals the rocks, and into the plants. You see, when I am in the forest, I am never alone, I am surrounded by spirit people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Salmon Is Everything|last=May|first=Theresa|publisher=Oregon State University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-087071-746-8|location=Eugene, OR|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was first performed at [[Humboldt State University]], and later at the [[University of Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cascade.uoregon.edu/spring2011/humanities/salmon-is-everything-a-many-si/ | title = Salmon Is Everything: A Many-Sided Story | accessdate = 2012-03-17 | last = Hickson | first = Patricia | year = 2011 | publisher = University of Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was the Book of the Year for Humboldt State University for 2015-2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Many documentaries have arisen from the event as well due to the heavy public response to the issue and the agreements that were settled in the aftermath. ''A River Between Us'' directed by Gregori J. Martin explains the various sides of the argument and shows how one native tribe went to a potato festival held by the people on the opposite side of the argument to help understand each other better and gain common ground. From the documentary it is clear many people gained common grounds with each other over time in the aftermath of the event.

An '''adulterant''' is a [[pejorative]] term for a substance found within other substances such as [[food]], [[fuel]]s or chemicals even though it is not allowed for legal or other reasons.

It will not normally be present in any specification or declared contents of the substance, and may not be legally allowed. The addition of adulterants is called '''adulteration'''. The most common reason for adulteration is the use by manufacturers of undeclared materials that are cheaper than the correct and declared ones.  The adulterants may be harmful, or reduce the potency of the product, or they may be harmless.

The term "[[contamination]]" is usually used for the inclusion of unwanted substances due to accident or negligence rather than intent, and also for the introduction of unwanted substances after the product has been made.  Adulteration therefore implies that the adulterant was introduced deliberately in the initial manufacturing process, or sometimes that it was present in the raw materials and should have been removed, but was not.

An adulterant is distinct from, for example, permitted [[food additive]]s. There can be a fine line between adulterant and additive; [[chicory]] may be added to [[coffee]] to reduce the cost or achieve a desired flavour—this is adulteration if not declared, but may be stated on the label. [[Chalk]] was often added to [[bread flour]]; this reduces the cost and increases whiteness, but the [[calcium]] actually confers health benefits, and in modern bread a little chalk may be included as an additive for this reason.

In wartime adulterants have been added to make foodstuffs "go further" and prevent shortages. The German word ''[[ersatz]]'' is widely recognised from such practices during [[World War II]]. Such adulteration was sometimes deliberately hidden from the population to prevent loss of morale and propaganda reasons. Some goods considered luxurious in the [[Communist Bloc]] such as coffee were adulterated to make them affordable to the general population.

Adulterants added to reduce the amount of expensive product in [[illicit drugs]] are called [[cutting agent]]s. Deliberate addition of toxic adulterants to food or other products for human consumption is [[poison]]ing.

==In food and beverages==
Past and present examples of adulteration, some dangerous, include:
* Roasted [[chicory]] roots used as an adulterant for [[coffee]]
* [[Diethylene glycol]], used dangerously by some winemakers in [[sweet wine]]s
* [[Apple]] jellies (jams), as substitutes for more expensive fruit [[Fruit preserves|jellies]], with added colorant and sometimes even specks of wood that simulate raspberry or strawberry seeds
* [[Water]], for diluting [[milk]] and [[alcoholic beverage]]s
* [[Cutting agent]]s used to adulterate (or "cut") illicit drugs—for example, [[shoe polish]] in [[hashish]], [[amphetamine]]s in [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]], [[lactose]] in [[cocaine]]
* [[Urea]], [[melamine]] and other nonprotein [[nitrogen]] sources, added to [[protein]] products to inflate crude protein content measurements&lt;ref name=USAToday&gt;{{cite news

==History==
Historically, the use of adulterants has been common; sometimes dangerous substances have been used. In the [[United Kingdom]] up to the [[Victorian era]], adulterants were common; for example, [[cheese]]s were sometimes colored with [[lead]]. Similar adulteration issues were seen in industry in the [[United States]], during the 19th century. There is dispute over whether these practices declined primarily due to government regulation or to increased public awareness and concern over the practices.

In the early 21st century, cases of dangerous adulteration occurred in the [[People's Republic of China]].

In some African countries, it is not uncommon for thieves to break electric [[transformer]]s to steal [[transformer oil]], which is then sold to the operators of roadside [[food stall]]s to be used for [[deep frying]]. When used for frying, it is reported that transformer oil lasts much longer than regular [[cooking oil]]. The downside of this misuse of the transformer oil is the threat to the health of the consumers, due to the presence of [[PCBs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/12/thieves-fry-kenya-power-grid-fast-food-2014122884728785480.html Thieves fry Kenya's power grid for fast food], Al Jazeera, 2014-12-28&lt;/ref&gt;

Adulterant use was first investigated in [[1820#Events|1820]] by the German chemist [[Frederick Accum]], who identified many toxic metal colorings in food and drink. His work antagonized food suppliers, and he was ultimately discredited by a scandal over his alleged mutilation of books of the [[Royal Institution]] library. The physician [[Arthur Hill Hassall]] conducted extensive studies in the early 1850s, which were published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' and led to the 1860 Food Adulteration Act and other legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Coley |first= Noel |date= 1 March 2005 |title= The fight against food adulteration |url= https://eic.rsc.org/feature/the-fight-against-food-adulteration/2020253.article |magazine= [[Education in Chemistry]] |volume= 42 |issue= 2 |pages= 46–49 |publisher= [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |access-date= 19 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Postgate (food safety campaigner)|John Postgate]] led a further campaign, leading to another Act of 1875, which forms the basis of the modern legislation and a system of [[public analyst]]s who test for adulteration.

At the turn of the 20th century, industrialization in the United States led to a rise in adulteration which inspired some protest. Accounts of adulteration led the [[New York Evening Post|New York ''Evening Post'']] to parody:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Mary had a little lamb,
And when she saw it sicken,
She shipped it off to Packingtown,
And now it's labeled chicken.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey M. Pilcher, ''Food in World History'' New York: [[Routledge]], 2006, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, even in the 18th century, people complained about adulteration in food:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The bread I eat in London is a deleterious paste, mixed up with chalk, alum and bone ashes, insipid to the taste and destructive to the constitution. The good people are not ignorant of this adulteration; but they prefer it to wholesome bread, because it is whiter than the meal of corn [wheat]. Thus they sacrifice their taste and their health. . . to a most absurd gratification of a misjudged eye; and the miller or the baker is obliged to poison them and their families, in order to live by his profession." – [[Tobias Smollet]], ''[[The Expedition of Humphry Clinker]]'' (1771)&lt;ref name="weston"&gt;[http://www.westonaprice.org/modern-diseases/digestive-disorders/621-against-the-grain.html Weston A.Price: Against the Grain, Section Bread to Feed the Masses]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Incidents of adulteration==

* In 1987, [[Beech-Nut]] was fined for violating the US [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] by selling flavored sugar water as apple juice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1370/is_n5_v22/ai_6495698 Juiceless baby juice leads to full-length justice|FDA Consumer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210213152/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1370/is_n5_v22/ai_6495698 |date=2007-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1997, [[ConAgra Foods]] illegally sprayed water on stored grain to increase its weight.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE0DC1F38F933A15750C0A961958260 ConAgra Set to Settle Criminal Charges It Increased Weight and Value of Grain – New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2007, samples of [[wheat gluten (food)|wheat gluten]] mixed with [[melamine]], presumably to produce inflated results from tests for protein content, were discovered in the USA. They were found to have come from China. ''(See: [[Chinese protein adulteration]].)''
* In 2008, significant portions of China's [[milk]] supply were found to have been adulterated with melamine. [[Infant formula]] produced from this milk killed at least six children and is believed to have harmed thousands of others. ''(See: [[2008 Chinese milk scandal]].)''
* In 2012, a study in India across 29 states and union territories found that milk was adulterated with detergent, fat, and even [[urea]], and diluted with water. Just 31.5% of samples conformed to FSSAI standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sinha |first=Kounteya |date=10 January 2012 |title=70% of milk in Delhi, country is adulterated |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/70-of-milk-in-Delhi-country-is-adulterated/articleshow/11429910.cms |newspaper=Times of India |accessdate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
At the time of the [[Indian Independence Movement]], [[Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi|K.M. Munshi]] advocated for ''Akhand Hindustan'', a proposition that [[Mahatma Gandhi]], believing that "as Britain wanted to retain her empire by pursuing a policy of [[divide and rule]], Hindu-Muslim unity could not be achieved as long as the British were there."&lt;ref name="Ghose1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ghose|first=Sankar|title=Mahatma Gandhi|date=1 January 1991|publisher=[[Allied Publishers]]|isbn=9788170232056|page=315|quote=Later, K.M. Munishi, with Gandhi's blessing, also resigned from the Congress to plead for Akhand Hindustan as a counter blast to Pakistan. Gandhi, who previously thought that swaraj was impossible without Hindu-Muslim unity, subsequently came to the conclusion that as Britain wanted to retain her empire by pursuing a policy of divide and rule, Hindu-Muslim unity could not be achieved as long as the British were there.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Mazhar Ali Khan (journalist)|Mazhar Ali Khan]] wrote that "the [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan|Khan]] brothers [were] determined to fight for Akhand Hindustan, and challenged the [[All-India Muslim League|League]] to fight the issue out before the electorate of the Province."&lt;ref name="KhanKhan1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Khan|first=Mazhar Ali|title=Pakistan: The First Twelve Years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_BtAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 July 2014|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195776768|quote=Many months ago, when the Pakistan issue was still in the melting pot, the Khan brothers determined to fight for Akhand Hindustan, and challenged the League to fight the issue out before the electorate of the Province.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7–8 October 1944, in Delhi, [[Radha Kumud Mukherjee]] presided over the Akhand Hindusthan Leaders' Conference.&lt;ref name="Sharma2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma|first=Jai Narain|title=Encyclopaedia Eminent Thinkers|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=9788180694929|page=88|quote=On 5 August 1944, he issued a common letter to the leaders of various parties making a proposal to hold Akhand Hindustan Leaders' Conference.

==Usage==
The call for creation of the ''Akhand Bharat'' or ''Akhand Hindusthan'' has on occasions been raised by [[India]]n [[Hindutva]]wadi cultural and political organisations such as the [[Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha|Hindu Mahasabha]], [[Kakbhusundi Revolutionary Forum]](KRF), [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]], [[Hindu Janajagruti Samiti]], and [[Bharatiya Janata Party]].&lt;ref name="Suda1953"&gt;{{cite book|last=Suda|first=Jyoti Prasad|title=India, Her Civic Life and Administration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVsNAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=23 July 2014|year=1953|publisher=Jai Prakash Nath &amp; Co.|quote=Its members still swear by the ideal of Akhand Hindusthan.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferguson&gt;Yale H.

Pre-1947 maps of pre-partition India showing the current states of Pakistan and Bangladesh as part of the territories of British India illustrate the borders of a proto-Akhand Bharat.&lt;ref name=Majumder/&gt; The creation of an Akhand Bharat is also ideologically linked with the concept of ''[[Hindutva]]'' (Hinduness) and the ideas of ''sangathan'' (unity) and ''[[shuddhi]]'' (purification) that seek to focus modern Indian politics on a legendary ancient civilisation and heritage of the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name=Martensson/&gt;

While the leadership of the right-wing [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] wavers on the issue, the RSS has always remained a strong proponent of the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Jyotirmaya Sharma, "[http://www.hindu.com/mag/2005/06/19/stories/2005061900260100.htm Ideological heresy?], ''[[The Hindu]]'', 2005-06-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radhika Ramaseshan, "[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050616/asp/frontpage/story_4874540.asp Advani fires Atal weapon]", ''[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]]'', 2005-06-16&lt;/ref&gt; RSS leader [[H.

In March 1988, his mother returned to Burma in order to nurse her dying mother [[Khin Kyi|Daw Khin Kyi]], the wife of Aung San.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Peter | last=Stanford | title=The pain of Aung Sun Suu Kyi’s sons, parted from their mother for 25 years | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/9349279/The-pain-of-Aung-Sun-Suu-Kyis-sons-parted-from-their-mother-for-25-years.html | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=22 June 2012 | accessdate=21 April 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140526123324/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/9349279/The-pain-of-Aung-Sun-Suu-Kyis-sons-parted-from-their-mother-for-25-years.html | archivedate=26 May 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She did not return to Oxford until June 2012, having been placed under house arrest in Burma for political reasons in 1989.

==Education==
Aris was educated at two private schools in his home city of [[Oxford]], in southern England: at [[The Dragon School]], a co-educational preparatory (junior) school, followed by [[Magdalen College School, Oxford|Magdalen College School]], a senior school for boys, which he left in 1990. He graduated from [[Northern Illinois University]] in the United States and received a [[MSc]] in [[Mathematical Sciences]].

==Life after mother's detention==
In 1989, Alexander and his brother Kim were both stripped of their Burmese citizenships by the ruling junta. The two brothers are British nationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/IL04Ae01.html |title=Myanmar back on a roadmap to nowhere |publisher=Asia Times Online |date=4 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Alexander's mother Aung San Suu Kyi won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for her efforts in Burma. At the time, Alexander Aris (age 18) and his brother Kim Aris (age 14) accepted the Prize on their mother's behalf. The Nobel Peace Prize's 1.3 million [[USD]] prize money was used to establish a [[health]] and [[education]] trust for the Burmese people.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J. E.

The '''American Measurement Standard''' is an authoritative measurement standard for use with single-family [[dwellings]]. The '''AMS''' C42129-2009 is a voluntary guide developed for the measurement, calculation, and communication of [[square footage]] in [[residential]] dwellings. 

==Description==
This standard defines eight specific categories for the reporting of all space associated with a residential dwelling. The AMS helps to establish common and logical definitions of "finished square footage" and "gross living area." The [[methodology]] of the American Measurement Standard was compiled and edited by a consensus of real estate professionals including [[Estate agent|real estate agents]], [[appraiser]]s, assessors, home builders and [[architects]], and is based on the exterior dimensions of a dwelling. The AMS contains over three times more specific home measurement details than any other square footage guideline and includes numerous illustrations and examples. The standard provides acceptable square footage calculations for use in residential [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] appraisals, and provides acceptable measurements for mortgage lenders. The principles and practices detailed in the standard have been used for generations in professional appraisal reports.

{{Anthropology}}

==Early life==
Appadurai was born into a Tamil Brahmin family in [[Mumbai]] (Bombay), [[Dominion of India|India]] and educated in [[India]]. He graduated from [[St. Xavier's High School, Fort]], [[Mumbai]], and earned his Intermediate Arts degree from [[Elphinstone College]], [[Mumbai]], before moving to the [[United States]].

He then received his B.A. from [[Brandeis University]] in 1970.

==Career==
He was formerly a professor at the [[University of Chicago]] where he received his M.A. (1973) and Ph.D (1976). After working there, he spent a brief time at [[Yale]] before going to the [[New School University]]. He currently is a faculty member of New York University's Media Culture and Communication department in the Steinhardt School. Some of his most important works include ''Worship and Conflict under Colonial Rule'' (1981), ''Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy'' (1990), of which an expanded version is found in ''[[Modernity]] at Large'' (1996), and ''Fear of Small Numbers'' (2006). In addition to his work on globalization, one of Appadurai's earlier publications, ''The Social Life of Things'' (1986), argues for the social dimension of commodities' values and meanings from an anthropological framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bello|first=Paula|year=2010|title=The Shifting Global Landscapes of Things: Goodscapes|journal=Design and Culture|volume=2|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=19 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110510021801/http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf| archivedate= 10 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His doctoral work was based on the car festival held in the [[Parthasarathy Temple, Triplicane|Parthasarathi temple]] in [[Triplicane]], [[Madras]]. Arjun Appadurai is member of the Advisory Board of the Forum d'[[Avignon]], international meetings of culture, the economy and the media.

===New School===
In 2004, after a brief time as administrator at [[Yale University]], Appadurai became [[Provost (education)|Provost]] of [[New School University]]. Appadurai's resignation from the Provost's office was announced January 30, 2006 by New School President [[Bob Kerrey]]. He held the [[John Dewey]] Distinguished Professorship in the Social Sciences at New School.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060111005610/http://www.newschool.edu/gf/anthro/faculty/appadurai/] Appadurai became one of the more outspoken critics of President Kerrey when he attempted to appoint himself provost in 2008 [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/11/nyregion/11kerrey.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5124&amp;en=641599f0747e8eac&amp;ex=1386651600&amp;partner=facebook&amp;exprod=facebook].

===New York University===
In 2008 it was announced that Appadurai was appointed Goddard Professor of Media, Culture, and Communication at the [[NYU]] [[Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/public.affairs/releases/detail/2238 NYU Steinhardt Appoints Arjun Appadurai As Goddard Professor of Media, Culture, and Communication] ''[[NYU]]'', Monday, September 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Affiliations ===
{{See also|Public Culture}}
Appadurai is a co-founder of the academic journal ''[[Public Culture]]'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicculture.org Public Culture] ''[[Public Culture]]'' website&lt;/ref&gt; founder of the non-profit [[Partners for Urban Knowledge, Action and Research]] (PUKAR) in Mumbai; co-founder and co-director of Interdisciplinary Network on [[Globalization]] (ING); and a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. He has served as a consultant or advisor to a wide range of public and private organizations, including the [[Ford Foundation|Ford]], [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller]] and [[MacArthur foundation|MacArthur]] foundations; [[UNESCO]]; the [[World Bank]]; and the [[National Science Foundation]].

==Theory==
In his best known work 'Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy' Appadurai lays out his meta theory of disjuncture. For him the ‘new global cultural economy has to be seen as a complex, overlapping, disjunctive order’.&lt;ref&gt;"Disjuncture and Difference", ''Modernity at Large'', 32&lt;/ref&gt; This order is composed of different interrelated, yet disjunctive global cultural flows,&lt;ref&gt;Josiah McC. Heyman, Howard Campbell (2009) "The Anthropology of Global Flows:A critical reading of Appadurai's `Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy", ''Anthropological Theory(9:2) 131-148'', 133.&lt;/ref&gt; specifically the following five:

# [[ethnoscape]]s; the migration of people across cultures and borders, 
# [[mediascape]]s; use of media that shapes the way we understand our imagined world 
# [[technoscape]]s; cultural interactions due to the promotion of technology 
# [[financescape]]s; the flux capital across borders 
# [[ideoscape]]s; is the global flow of ideologies

===The social imaginary===
Appadurai articulated a view of cultural activity known as the [[imaginary (sociology)|social imaginary]], which is composed of the five dimensions of global cultural flows.

He describes his articulation of the imaginary as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The image, the imagined, the imaginary – these are all terms that direct us to something critical and new in global cultural processes: the imagination as a social practice.  No longer mere fantasy (opium for the masses whose real work is somewhere else), no longer simple escape (from a world defined principally by more concrete purposes and structures), no longer elite pastime (thus not relevant to the lives of ordinary people), and no longer mere contemplation (irrelevant for new forms of desire and subjectivity), the imagination has become an organized field of social practices, a form of work (in the sense of both labor and culturally organized practice), and a form of negotiation between sites of agency (individuals) and globally defined fields of possibility. This unleashing of the imagination links the play of pastiche (in some settings) to the terror and coercion of states and their competitors.  The imagination is now central to all forms of agency, is itself a social fact, and is the key component of the new global order.&lt;ref&gt;"Disjuncture and Difference", ''Modernity at Large'', 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Appadurai credits [[Benedict Anderson]] with developing notions of [[imagined communities]]. Some key figures who have worked on the imaginary are [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], [[Jacques Lacan]] (who especially worked on the [[symbol]]ic, in contrast with imaginary and the real), and [[Dilip Gaonkar]]. However, Appadurai's ethnography of urban social movements in the city of Mumbai has proved to be contentious with several scholars like the Canadian anthropologist, Judith Whitehead arguing that SPARC (an organization which Appadurai espouses as an instance of progressive social activism in housing) being complicit in the World Bank's agenda for re-developing Mumbai.

In the period from 1885 to 1908, many well-documented atrocities were perpetrated in the [[Congo Free State]] (today the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) which, at the time, was a [[colonialism|colony]] under the personal rule of [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II of Belgium]]. These atrocities were sometimes collectively referred to by European contemporaries as the "Congo Horrors", and were particularly associated with the labour policies used to collect [[natural rubber]] for export. Together with epidemic disease, famine, and a falling birth rate caused by these disruptions, the atrocities contributed to a sharp decline in the Congolese population. The magnitude of the population fall over the period is disputed, but it is thought to be between one and 15 million people.

At the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884–85, the European powers allocated the [[Congo Basin]] region to a private charitable organisation run by Leopold II, who had long held ambitions for colonial expansion. The territory under Leopold's control exceeded {{convert|1,000,000|mi2|km2|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} and, amid financial problems, was ruled by a tiny cadre of white administrators drawn from across Europe. Initially, the colony proved unprofitable and insufficient, with the state always close to bankruptcy. The boom in demand for [[natural rubber]], which was abundant in the territory, created a radical shift in the 1890s—to facilitate the extraction and export of rubber, all "uninhabited" land in the Congo was nationalised, with the majority distributed to private companies as [[Concession (contract)|concessions]]. Some was kept by the state. Between 1891 and 1906, the companies were allowed to do whatever they wished with almost no judicial interference, the result being that [[forced labour]] and violent coercion were used to collect the rubber cheaply and maximise profit. A native paramilitary army, the ''[[Force Publique]]'', was also created to enforce the labour policies. Individual workers who refused to participate in rubber collection could be killed and entire villages razed. Individual white administrators were also free to indulge their own sadism.

Despite these atrocities, the main cause of the population decline was disease. A number of pandemics, notably [[African trypanosomiasis|African sleeping sickness]], [[smallpox]], [[swine influenza]], and [[amoebic dysentery]], ravaged indigenous populations. In 1901 alone it was estimated that 500,000 Congolese had died from sleeping sickness. Disease, famine and violence combined to reduce the birth-rate while [[excess death]]s rose.

The severing of workers' hands achieved particular international notoriety. These were sometimes cut off by ''Force Publique'' soldiers who were made to account for every shot they fired by bringing back the hands of their victims. These details were recorded by [[Christian mission|Christian missionaries]] working in the Congo and caused public outrage when they were made known to the public in the United Kingdom, Belgium, the United States and elsewhere. An international campaign against the Congo Free State began in 1890 and reached its apogee after 1900 under the leadership of the British activist [[E. D. Morel]]. In 1908, as a result of international pressure, the Belgian government annexed the Congo Free State to form the [[Belgian Congo]], and ended many of the systems responsible for the abuses. The size of the population decline during the period is the subject of extensive [[historiography|historiographical]] debate, and there is an open debate as to whether the atrocities constitute genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stanley|first1=Tim|title=Belgium's Heart of Darkness|url=http://www.historytoday.com/tim-stanley/belgiums-heart-darkness|website=History Today|accessdate=6 March 2017|ref=Stanley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ankomah|first1=Baffour|title=The Butcher of Congo|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/35/181.html|website=AfricaAsia.com|accessdate=6 March 2017|ref=Anomakah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Kongovrijstaat.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of the [[Congo Free State]] in 1892]]
Even before his accession to the throne of [[Belgium]] in 1865, the future king [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]] began lobbying leading Belgian politicians to create a colonial empire in the Far East or Africa, which would expand and enhance Belgian prestige.{{sfn|Pakenham|1992|pp=12–5}} Politically, however, colonisation was unpopular in Belgium as it was perceived as a risky and expensive gamble with no obvious benefit to the country and his many attempts to persuade politicians met with little success.{{sfn|Pakenham|1992|pp=12–5}}

Determined to look for a colony for himself and inspired by recent reports from central Africa, Leopold began patronising a number of leading explorers, including [[Henry Morton Stanley]].{{sfn|Pakenham|1992|pp=12–5}} Leopold established the [[International African Association]] (''Association internationale africaine''), a "charitable" organisation to oversee the exploration and surveying of a territory based around the [[Congo River]], with the stated goal of bringing humanitarian assistance and civilisation to the natives. In the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884–85, European leaders officially recognised Leopold's control over the {{convert|2,350,000|km2|abbr=on}} of the notionally-independent [[Congo Free State]] on the grounds that it would be a [[free trade]] area and [[buffer state]] between British and French spheres of influence.{{sfn|Pakenham|1992|pp=253–5}} In the Free State, Leopold exercised total personal control without much delegation to subordinates.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=171}} African chiefs played an important role in the administration by implementing government orders within their communities.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=172}} Throughout much of its existence, however, Free State presence in the territory that it claimed was patchy, with its few officials concentrated in a number of small and widely dispersed "stations" which controlled only small amounts of hinterland.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=275}} In 1900, there were just 3,000 white people in the Congo, of whom only half were Belgian.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=63}} The colony was perpetually short of administrative staff and officials, who numbered between 700 and 1,500 during the period.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=173}}

In the early years of the colony, much of the administration's attention was focused on consolidating its control by fighting the African peoples on the colony's periphery who resisted colonial rule. These included the tribes around the [[Kwango river]], in the south-west, and the [[Uele River|Uélé]] in the north-east.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=60}} Some of the violence of the period can be attributed to African groups using colonial support to settle scores or white administrators acting without state approval.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=91}}

===Economic and administrative situation===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="Ultimately the state's policy towards its African subjects became dominated by the demands which were made—both by the state itself and by the concessionary companies—for labour for the collection of wild produce of the territory. The system itself engendered abuses&amp;nbsp;..."|2=Ruth Slade (1962){{sfn|Slade|1962|p=178}}}}

The Free State was intended, above all, to be profitable for its investors and Leopold in particular.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=274}} Its finances were frequently precarious. Early reliance on [[ivory]] exports did not make as much money as hoped and the colonial administration was frequently in debt, nearly defaulting on a number of occasions.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=272}} A boom in demand for [[natural rubber]] in the 1890s, however, ended these problems as the colonial state was able to force Congolese males to work as forced labour collecting wild rubber which could then be exported to Europe and North America.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=272}} The rubber boom transformed what had been an unexceptional colonial system before 1890 and led to significant profits.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|pp=78–9}} Exports rose from 580 to 3,740 tons between 1895 and 1900.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=37}}

In order to facilitate economic extraction from the colony, land was divided up under the so-called Domain System (''régime domanial'') in 1891.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=265}}{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=177}} All vacant land, including forests and areas not under cultivation, was decreed to be "[[Terra nullius|uninhabited]]" and thus the possession of the state, leaving many of the Congo's resources (especially rubber and ivory) under direct colonial ownership.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=265}}{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=79}} [[Concession (territory)|Concessions]] were allocated to private companies. In the north, the ''[[Société Anversoise]]'' was given {{convert|160,000|km2|abbr=on}}, while the [[Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company]] (ABIR) was given a comparable territory in the south.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=87}} The ''[[Compagnie du Katanga]]'' and ''[[Compagnie des Grands Lacs]]'' were given smaller concessions in the south and east respectively. Leopold kept a large proportion of territory under personal rule, known as the Crown Domain (''Domaine de la Couronne''), of {{convert|250,000|km2|abbr=on}} which was added to the territory he already controlled under the Private Domain (''Domaine privé'').{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=87}}{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=37}} "The major economic exploitation of the Congolese interior, therefore, lay in the hands of the king and a few privileged concessionaries."{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=87}} The system was extremely profitable and ABIR made a turnover of over 100 per cent on its initial stake in a single year.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=38}} The King made 70 million [[Belgian franc]]s' profit from the system between 1896 and 1905.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=177}} The Free State's concession system was soon copied by other colonial regimes, notably those in the neighbouring [[French Congo]].{{sfn|Vangroenweghe|2006|pp=323–6}}

==Atrocities==

===Red Rubber system and forced labour===
[[File:StoryoftheCongoFreeState 280.jpg|thumb|upright|Congolese labourers tapping [[Cryptostegia grandiflora|rubber vines]] near [[Lusambo]] in [[Kasai region|Kasai]]]]
With the majority of the Free State's revenues derived from the export of rubber, a labour policy (known by critics as the "Red Rubber system") was created to maximise its extraction. Labour was demanded by the administration as taxation.{{efn|Demanding taxation in the form of forced labour was common across colonial Africa at the time.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|pp=267–8}}}} This created a "slave society" as companies became increasingly dependent on forcibly mobilising Congolese labour for their collection of rubber.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=28}} The state recruited a number of black officials, known as ''capitas'', to organise local labour.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=28}} However, the desire to maximise rubber collection, and hence the state's profits, meant that the centrally-enforced demands were often set arbitrarily without considering the numbers or the welfare of workers.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|pp=267–8}} In the concessionary territories, the private companies which had purchased a concession from the Free State administration were able to use virtually any measures they wished to increase production and profits without state interference.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=272}} The lack of a developed bureaucracy to oversee any commercial methods produced an atmosphere of "informality" throughout the state in regards to the operation of enterprises, which in turn facilitated abuses.{{sfn|Gibbs|1991|p=51}} Treatment of labourers (especially the duration of service) was not regulated by law and instead was left to the discretion of officials on the ground.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|pp=267–8}} [[Abir Congo Company|ABIR]] and the ''Anversoise'' were particularly noted for the harshness with which officials treated Congolese workers. The historian [[Jean Stengers]] described regions controlled by these two companies as "veritable hells-on-earth".{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=270}}

[[File:Vauthier Rene Le Congo Belge 159 Les sentinelles de la Princesse Clementine.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Force Publique]]'' soldiers photographed in 1900]]
Workers who refused to supply their labour were coerced with "constraint and repression". Dissenters were beaten or whipped with the ''[[chicotte]]'', hostages were taken to ensure prompt collection and punitive expeditions were sent to destroy villages which refused.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|pp=267–8}} The policy led to a collapse of Congolese economic and cultural life, as well as farming in some areas.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=94}} Much of the enforcement of rubber production was the responsibility of the ''[[Force Publique]]'', the colonial military. The ''Force'' had originally been established in 1885, with white officers and NCOs and black soldiers, and recruited from as far afield as [[Zanzibar]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Liberia]].{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|pp=76–7}} In the Congo, it recruited from specific ethnic and social demographics.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=173}} These included the [[Ngala people|Bangala]], and this contributed to the spread of the [[Lingala]] language across the country, and freed slaves from the eastern Congo.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|pp=76–7}} The so-called [[Zappo Zap|Zappo-Zaps]] (from the [[Songye people|Songye ethnic group]]) were the most feared. Reportedly cannibals, the Zappo-Zaps frequently abused their official positions to raid the countryside for slaves.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=181}} By 1900, the ''Force Publique'' numbered 19,000 men.{{sfn|Hochschild|1999|p=123}}

The red rubber system emerged with the creation of the concession regime in 1891{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2007|p=22}} and lasted until 1906 when the concession system was restricted.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=270}} At its height, it was heavily localised in the [[Équateur (former province)|Équateur]], [[Bandundu Province|Bandundu]], and [[Kasai region|Kasai]] regions.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=96}}

===Mutilation and brutality===
[[File:Victim of Congo atrocities, Congo, ca. 1890-1910 (IMP-CSCNWW33-OS10-19).jpg|thumb|A missionary points to the severed hand of a Congolese villager. Severed hands were "the most potent symbol of colonial brutality" in the Congo.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=30}}]]

Failure to meet the rubber collection quotas was punishable by death. Meanwhile, the Force Publique were required to provide the hand of their victims as proof when they had shot and killed someone, as it was believed that they would otherwise use the munitions (imported from Europe at considerable cost) for hunting. As a consequence, the rubber quotas were in part paid off in chopped-off hands. Sometimes the hands were collected by the soldiers of the Force Publique, sometimes by the villages themselves. There were even small wars where villages attacked neighboring villages to gather hands, since their rubber quotas were too unrealistic to fill. A Catholic priest quotes a man, Tswambe, speaking of the hated state official Léon Fiévez, who ran a district along the river {{convert|300|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} north of [[Pool Malebo|Stanley Pool]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All blacks saw this man as the devil of the [[Equator]] ... From all the bodies killed in the field, you had to cut off the hands. He wanted to see the number of hands cut off by each soldier, who had to bring them in baskets ... A village which refused to provide rubber would be completely swept clean. As a young man, I saw [Fiévez's] soldier Molili, then guarding the village of Boyeka, take a net, put ten arrested natives in it, attach big stones to the net, and make it tumble into the river ... Rubber causes these torments; that's why we no longer want to hear its name spoken. Soldiers made young men kill or [[rape]] their own mothers and sisters.&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, ''King Leopold's Ghost'', p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One junior officer described a raid to punish a village that had protested. The officer in command "ordered us to cut off the heads of the men and hang them on the village palisades ... and to hang the women and the children on the palisade in the form of a cross".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bourne |first=Henry Richard Fox |title=Civilisation in Congoland: A Story of International Wrong-doing |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jWccAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22Civilisation+in+Congoland%22#PPR3,M1 |accessdate=2007-09-26 |year=1903 |publisher=P. S. King &amp; Son |location=London |pages=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; After seeing a Congolese person killed for the first time, a Danish missionary wrote, "The soldier said 'Don't take this to heart so much. They kill us if we don't bring the rubber. The Commissioner has promised us if we have plenty of hands he will shorten our service.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forbath |first=Peter |title=The River Congo: The Discovery, Exploration and Exploitation of the World's Most Dramatic Rivers |year=1977 |publisher=[[Harper &amp; Row]] |location= |isbn=0-06-122490-1 |pages=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Forbath's words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The baskets of severed hands, set down at the feet of the European post commanders, became the symbol of the Congo Free State. ... The collection of hands became an end in itself. ''Force Publique'' soldiers brought them to the stations in place of rubber; they even went out to harvest them instead of rubber ... They became a sort of currency. They came to be used to make up for shortfalls in rubber quotas, to replace ... the people who were demanded for the forced labour gangs; and the ''Force Publique'' soldiers were paid their bonuses on the basis of how many hands they collected.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In theory, each right hand proved a killing. In practice, to save ammunition soldiers sometimes "cheated" by simply cutting off the hand and leaving the victim to live or die. More than a few survivors later said that they had lived through a massacre by acting dead, not moving even when their hands were severed, and waiting till the soldiers left before seeking help. In some instances a soldier could shorten his service term by bringing more hands than the other soldiers, which led to widespread mutilations and dismemberment. Other practices used to force workers to collect rubber were taking women and family members hostage.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=31}}

Aside from rubber collection, violence in the Free State chiefly occurred in connection with wars and rebellions. Native states, notably [[Msiri]]'s [[Yeke Kingdom]], the [[Zande Federation]], and Swahili-speaking territory in the eastern Congo under [[Tippu Tip]], refused to recognise colonial authority and were defeated by the ''Force Publique'' with great brutality, during the [[Congo Arab war]].{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=33}} In 1895, [[Batetela Rebellion|a military mutiny]] broke out among the Batetela in Kasai, leading to a 4-year insurgency. The conflict was particularly brutal and caused a great number of casualties.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=82}}

Leopold II was reported to have disapproved of the dismemberments, not on human rights grounds but because it harmed his economic interests. He was quoted as saying "Cut off hands - that's idiotic. I'd cut off all the rest of them, but not hands. That's the one thing I need in the Congo."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/may/13/features11.g22|title=The hidden holocaust|date=1999-05-13|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population decline==

===Causes===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="I suggest that it is impossible to separate deaths caused by massacre and starvation from those due to the pandemic of sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis) which decimated central Africa at the time."|2=[[Neal Ascherson]] (1999){{sfn|Ascherson|1999|p=9}}}}

Historians generally agree that a dramatic reduction in the overall size of the Congolese population occurred during the two decades of Free State rule in the Congo.{{sfn|Gibbs|1991|p=46}} It is argued that the reduction in the Congo was atypical and can be attributed to the direct and indirect effects of colonial rule and especially to disease and falling birthrate.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=37}}

The historian [[Adam Hochschild]] argued that the dramatic fall in the Free State population was the result of a combination of "murder", "starvation, exhaustion and exposure", "disease" and "a plummeting birth rate".{{sfn|Hochschild|1999|p=226}} [[Roger Casement]], concurs with this view.&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, A. pp. 226–232.&lt;/ref&gt; [[African trypanosomiasis|Sleeping sickness]] was also a major cause of fatality at the time. Opponents of Leopold's rule stated, however, that the administration itself was to be considered responsible for the spreading of the epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, A. pp. 230–231.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is impossible to be sure in the absence of records, violence and murder represented only a portion of the total. In a local study of the [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]] and [[Kete people]]s, the historian [[Jan Vansina]] estimated that violence accounted for the deaths of less than five percent of the population.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=136}}

[[File:Trypanosoma sp. PHIL 613 lores.jpg|thumb|left|[[African trypanosomiasis]], estimated to have killed more than 500,000 Congolese in 1901 alone]]
Diseases imported by Arab traders, European colonists and African porters ravaged the Congolese population and "greatly exceeded" the numbers killed by violence.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=137}} [[Smallpox]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[amoebic dysentery]], venereal diseases (especially [[syphilis]] and [[gonorrhea]]), and [[swine influenza]] were particularly severe.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=138}} Sleeping sickness, in particular, was "epidemic in large areas" of the Congo and had a high mortality rate.{{sfn|Lyons|1992|p=7}} In 1901 alone, it is estimated that as many as 500,000 Congolese died from sleeping sickness.{{sfn|Hochschild|1999|p=231}} Vansina estimated that five percent of the Congolese population perished from swine influenza.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|pp=143–4}} In areas in which dysentery became endemic, between 30 and 60 percent of the population could die.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=143}} Vansina also pointed to the effects of malnutrition and food shortages in reducing immunity to the new diseases.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=136}} The disruption of African rural populations may have helped to spread diseases further.{{sfn|Ascherson|1999|p=9}} Nevertheless, historian Roger Anstey wrote that "a strong strand of local, oral tradition holds the rubber policy to have been a greater cause of death and depopulation than either the scourge of sleeping sickness or the periodic ravages of smallpox."{{sfn|Gibbs|1991|p=46}}

It is also widely believed that birth rates fell during the period too, meaning that the growth rate of the population fell relative to the [[natural death]] rate. Vansina, however, notes that precolonial societies had high birth and death rates, leading to a great deal of natural population fluctuation over time.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=146}} Among the Kuba, the period 1880 to 1900 was actually one of population expansion.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=137}}

===Estimates===
A reduction of the population of the Congo is noted by all who have compared the country at the beginning of Leopold's control with the beginning of Belgian state rule in 1908, but estimates of the death toll vary considerably. Estimates of some contemporary observers suggest that the population decreased by half during this period. According to [[E. D. Morel|Edmund D. Morel]], the Congo Free State counted "20 million souls".&lt;ref&gt;Morel, E. D. (1904) ''King Leopold's Rule in Africa''. London: William Heinnemann, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, [[Mark Twain]] mentioned the number of ten million deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Twain, M. (1905) ''King Leopold’s soliloquy a defense of his Congo rule''. Boston: P. R. Warren Co., p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Other estimates of the size of the overall population decline (or [[mortality displacement]]) range between two and 13 million.{{efn|The first census taken in the Congo was in 1924, so it is impossible to be sure of the size of the population at either the beginning or the end of the Free State period.{{sfn|Hochschild|1999|p=233}}{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=128}}}} Ascherson cites an estimate by Casement of a population fall of three million, although he notes that it is "almost certainly an underestimate".{{sfn|Ascherson|1999|pp=9, 251}}

In the absence of a [[census]] providing even an initial idea of the size of population of the region at the inception of the Congo Free State (the first was taken in 1924),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shelton |first=D. |title=Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity |year=2005 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] |location=[[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] |isbn=0-02-865849-3 |pages=621}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is impossible to quantify population changes in the period. Despite this, Forbath more recently claimed the loss was at least five million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forbath |first=P. |title=The River Congo: The Discovery, Exploration, and Exploitation of the World's Most Dramatic River, 1991 (Paperback) |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=0-06-122490-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Hochschild]] and [[Jan Vansina]] use the number 10 million. Hochschild cites several recent independent lines of investigation, by anthropologist Jan Vansina and others, that examine local sources (police records, religious records, oral traditions, genealogies, personal diaries), which generally agree with the assessment of the 1919 Belgian government commission: roughly half the population perished during the Free State period. Since the first official census by the Belgian authorities in 1924 put the population at about 10 million, these various approaches suggest a rough estimate of a total of 10 million dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. |last=Hochschild |authorlink=Adam Hochschild |title=King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-74329-160-3 |pages=225–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Vansina returned to the issue of quantifying the total population decline, and revised his earlier position, he concluded that the Kuba population (one of the many Congolese populations) was rising during the first two decades of Leopold II's rule, and declined with 25 percent from 1900 to 1919, mainly due to sickness.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Vansina is an anthropologist that made quantitative estimates based on qualitative research.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vansina, Jan (2010).

''Belgium and the Congo, 1885–1980''. New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-19421-1}}. p 25&lt;/ref&gt; Others argued a decrease of 20 percent over the first forty years of colonial rule (up to the census of 1924).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.congo2005.be/geheugen/brochureEN.pdf pages 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Congolese historian Isidore Ndaywel è Nziem 13 million died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Histoire générale du Congo: De l'héritage ancien à la République Démocratique|author=Ndaywel è Nziem, I}}&lt;/ref&gt; To put these population changes in context, sourced references state that in 1900 [[Africa]] as a whole had between 90 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=G. |title=What Went Wrong with Africa? |department=Review |journal=[[African Studies Review]] |volume=49 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=179–181 |doi=10.1353/arw.2006.0081}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 133 million people.&lt;ref&gt;World Population Prospects: The 2006 Revision&lt;/ref&gt; However, no verifiable records exist. Louis and Stengers state that population figures at the start of Leopold's control are only "wild guesses", while calling E. D. Morel's attempt and others at coming to a figure for population losses "but figments of the imagination".&lt;ref&gt;Louis, R. and Stengers, J. (1968) ''E.D. Morel's History of the Congo Reform Movement.'' Oxford: Clarendon, pp. 252–257.&lt;/ref&gt; However, authors that point out the lack of reliable demographic data are questioned by others calling the former minimalists and agnosticists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Roes |first1= A |year= 2010 |title= Towards a History of Mass Violence in the Etat Indépendant du Congo, 1885–1908 |url= |journal= South African Historical Journal |volume= 62 |issue= 4 |page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; proving that these questions remain the object of heated debate.

Since the first census of the Congolese population was made in 1924,{{efn|The accuracy of the 1924 census has itself been criticised.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=24}} }} there is a consensus among historians that accurate predictions of the population fall or number of deaths is impossible.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=24}}

==Investigation and international awareness==
[[File:Punch congo rubber cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|upright|1906 cartoon from the British satirical magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' showing a Congolese worker, entangled by a rubber snake with the head of Leopold II ]]

Eventually, growing scrutiny of Leopold's regime led to [[Congo Free State propaganda war|a popular campaign movement]], centered in the United Kingdom and the United States, to force Leopold to renounce his ownership of the Congo. In many cases, the campaigns based their information on reports from British and Swedish missionaries working in the Congo.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=179}}

The first international protest occurred in 1890 when [[George Washington Williams]], an American, published an open letter to Leopold about abuses he had witnessed.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=36}} Public interest in the abuses in the Congo Free State grew sharply from 1895, when the [[Stokes Affair]] and reports of mutilations reached the European and American public which began to discuss the "Congo Question".{{sfn|Slade|1962|pp=178–9}} To appease public opinion, Leopold instigated a Commission for the Protection of Natives (''Commission pour la Protection des Indigènes''), composed of foreign missionaries, but made few serious efforts at substantive reform.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=180}}

In Britain, the campaign was led by the activist and pamphleteer [[E. D. Morel]] after 1900, whose book ''[[Red Rubber]]'' (1906) reached a mass audience. Notable members of the campaign included the novelists [[Mark Twain]], Joseph Conrad and [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] as well as Belgian socialists such as [[Emile Vandervelde]].{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=39}} Campaigning groups, especially the [[Congo Reform Association]], inspired by its founder's [[Casement Report]], did not oppose colonialism and instead sought to end the excesses of the Free State by encouraging Belgium to annex the colony officially. This would avoid damaging the delicate balance of power between France and Britain on the continent. While supporters of the Free State regime attempted to argue against claims of atrocities, a Commission of Enquiry, appointed by the regime in 1904, confirmed the stories of atrocities and pressure on the Belgian government increased.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=26}}

In 1908, as a direct result of this campaign, Belgium formally annexed the territory, creating the [[Belgian Congo]].{{sfn|Pakenham|1992|pp=657; 663}} Conditions for the indigenous population improved dramatically with the suppression of forced labour, although many officials who had formerly worked for the Free State were retained in their posts long after annexation.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=271}} Instead of mandating labour for colonial enterprises directly, the Belgian administration used a coercive tax that deliberately pressured Congolese to find work with European employers to procure the necessary funds to make the payments. For some time after the end of the Free State the Congolese were also required to provide a certain number of days of service per year for infrastructure projects. In spite of these measures, the legacy of the population decline of Leopold's reign left the colonial government with a severe labour shortage and it often had to resort to mass migrations to provide workers to emerging businesses.{{sfn|Gibbs|1991|p=52}}

==Historiography and the term "genocide"==
The significant number of deaths under the Free State regime has led to some scholars to relate the atrocities to later genocides, though understanding of the losses under the colonial administration's rule as the result of harsh economic exploitation has led others to dispute the comparison.{{sfn|Stapleton|2017|p=87}} According to the [[United Nations]]' 1948 definition of the term "genocide", a genocide must be "acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group".{{sfn|Hochschild|1999|p=255}} Sociologist [[Rhoda Howard-Hassmann]] stated that because the Congolese were not killed in a systematic fashion according to this criterion, "technically speaking, this was not genocide even in a legally retroactive sense."{{sfn|Stapleton|2017|p=88}} Historians Hochschild and [[Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja]] have rejected allegations of genocide in the Free State because there is no evidence of a policy of deliberate extermination or the desire to eliminate any specific population groups,{{sfn|Hochschild|1999|p=255}}{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2007|p=22}} though the latter added that nevertheless there was "a death toll of [[Holocaust]] proportions."{{sfn|Stapleton|2017|p=88}}

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote="...&amp;nbsp;no reputable historian of the Congo has made charges of genocide; a forced labor system, although it may be equally deadly, is different."|source=Historian [[Adam Hochschild]] (2005){{sfn|New York Review of Books|2005}}}}

It is generally agreed by historians that extermination was never the policy of the Free State, which benefitted from the labour provided by Congolese workers. The Free State even made some efforts to attempt to tackle the spread of infectious diseases in the Congo by seeking the support of foreign medical institutes such as the [[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine]].{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=95}}{{sfn|Lyons|1992|p=74}} According to historian [[David Van Reybrouck]], "It would be absurd&amp;nbsp;... to speak of an act of 'genocide' or a 'holocaust'; genocide implies the conscious, planned annihilation of a specific population, and that was never the intention here, or the result&amp;nbsp;... But it was definitely a [[hecatomb]], a slaughter on a staggering scale that was not intentional, but could have been recognised much earlier as the collateral damage of a perfidious, rapacious policy of exploitation".{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=95}} According to Hochschild, "while not a case of genocide, in the strict sense", the atrocities in the Congo were "one of the most appalling slaughters known to have been brought about by human agency".{{sfn|Ascherson|1999|pp=8–9}}{{efn|Hochschild did label the [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide|German extermination of the Herero in South-West Africa]] (1904–1907) as a genocide because of its defined, systematic and intentional nature.{{sfn|Hochschild|1999|pp=281–2}}}}

[[File:Hands of Lingomo and Bolengo.tif|thumb|Picture of "Congolese men holding cut off hands" captured by [[Alice Seeley Harris]] in [[Baringa, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Baringa]], May 1904]]
Historians have argued that comparisons drawn in the press by some between the death toll of the Free State atrocities and the Holocaust during [[World War II]] have been responsible for creating undue confusion over the issue of terminology.{{sfn|New York Review of Books|2006}}{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=24}} In one incident, the Japanese newspaper ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'' used the word "genocide" in the title of a 2005 article by Hochschild. Hochschild himself criticised the title as "misleading" and stated that it had been chosen "without my knowledge". Similar criticism was echoed by other historians, including [[Jean-Luc Vellut]].{{sfn|New York Review of Books|2006}}{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=95}}

Allegations of genocide in the Free State have become common over time. According to historian [[Timothy J. Stapleton]], "Those who easily apply the term genocide to Leopold's regime seem to do so purely on the basis of its obvious horror and the massive numbers of people who may have perished."{{sfn|Stapleton|2017|pp=88–89}}
One of the few historians to use the term is [[Robert Weisbord]] who argued, in a 2003 article, that there does not have to be intent to exterminate all members of a population in a genocide.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=24}} He posited that "an endeavor to eliminate a portion of a people would qualify as genocide" according to the UN standards and asserted that the Free State did as much. Jeanne Haskin and Yaa-Lengi Meema Ngemi also refer to the atrocities as a genocide.{{sfn|Stapleton|2017|p=88}} [[Raphael Lemkin]], coiner of the term "genocide", authored a manuscript in the 1950s (it was not published) that asserted the occurrence of "an unambiguous genocide" in the Free State, attributing most of the population decline to the repressive actions of colonial troops.{{sfn|Stapleton|2017|p=87}} In 2005, an [[early day motion]] before the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]], introduced by [[Andrew Dismore]], called for the recognition of the Congo Free State's atrocities as a "colonial genocide" and called on the Belgian government to issue a formal apology. It was supported by 48 MPs.{{sfn|Early day motion 2251}}

The term "Congolese Genocide" is often used in an unrelated sense to refer to the mass murder and rape committed in the eastern Congo in the aftermath of the [[Rwandan Genocide]] (and the ensuing [[Second Congo War]]) between 1998 and 2003.{{sfn|Drumond|2011}}{{sfn|World Without Genocide|2012}}

The '''Audit Commission''' ({{zh|審計署}}) is one of the oldest government departments of the [[Government of Hong Kong]], known as Audit Department before July 1, 1997. The [[Director of Audit (Hong Kong)|Director of Audit]] is appointed by the [[Chief Executive]] (previously the [[Governors of Hong Kong]]). The Director reports to the Chief Executive, not the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]].  Its main functions are "to provide independent, professional and quality [[audit]] services to the [[Legislative Council]] and public sector organisations in order to help the Government enhance public sector performance and accountability in Hong Kong." According to the [https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap122 Audit Ordinance (Cap. 122)] the Director of Audit “has wide powers of access to the records of departments”, “can require any public officer to give an explanation and to furnish such information as he thinks fit to enable him to discharge his duties” and “is not subject to the direction or control of any other person or authority in performing his duties and when exercising his powers under the Ordinance.”

The Director of Audit submits three reports each year to the [[President of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong|President of the Legislative Council]]: One on the Accounts of the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region under section 12 of the Audit Ordinance and two on the results of value for money audits.

Recently, concerns have been raised as the Department has been used as a governmental tool to “deal with” departments that have not been “cooperative” to the government.  Controversies have been drawn towards how the accounts of the [[RTHK|Radio Television Hong Kong]] have been audited.

In the late 1960s, an independence movement was founded in [[Mindanao]], the [[Philippines]] to separate the [[Muslim]] majority-[[Moro people|Moro]] areas from the rest of the Philippines.  The area is now called the [[Bangsamoro (political entity)|Bangsamoro]].

In late 1968, at least 28 [[Muslim]] volunteers from [[Sulu]] who were being trained for a covert mission&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Violent Internal Conflicts in Asia Pacific: Histories, Political Economies, and Policies|author1=Adam, A.W.|author2=Anwar, D.F.|author3=Yayasan Obor Indonesia|year=2005|publisher=Yayasan Obor Indonesia|isbn=9789794615140|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yGDsxghgftQC}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Sabah]] were massacred by [[Philippine Government]] troops in the [[Jabidah Massacre]].  The first organization of the independence movement was [[Moro National Liberation Front]] (MNLF) founded by [[Nur Misuari]]. Subsequent break-away groups include the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] or MILF and the [[Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters]] or BIFF.

On March 27, 2014, a comprehensive peace deal was signed between the Government of the Republic of the Philippine, or GRP, and the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]].  This was after two decades of negotiations started during the administration of former President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] in 1997.

== Beginning of independence movement ==
[[Image:ARMM.png|right|thumb|Areas in [[Mindanao]] [[Philippines]] under [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] are in red.]]
In pursuit of their goal of “liberating” the [[Bangsamoro Republik|Bangsamoro]], the MNLF engaged the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|government forces]] in [http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft0199n64c;chunk.id=0;doc.view=print extensive armed collisions], peaking in the early 70s when the rebels’ blitz-like operations brought them control of a substantial number of municipalities surrounding [[Cotabato City]] and its airport complex. This prompted the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] regime to beef up military presence by [http://asiasociety.org/countries/conflicts/origins-muslim-separatist-movement-philippines?page=0,1 deploying almost three-fourths of the army] in most Muslim parts of [[Mindanao]]. Things took a different turn in 1976 when [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=QqgiE94IAmIC brokered an agreement] that led to the signing of the [http://mnlfnet.com/The_Tripoli.htm Tripoli Agreement] that introduced the concept of an autonomous Muslim region in Mindanao. On August 1, 1989, under the mandate of the new [http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/index7.php?doctype=Constitutions&amp;docid=a45475a11ec72b843d74959b60fd7bd64558f82c40d9d#sam 1987 Constitution], [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] enacted [http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1989/ra_6734_1989.html Republic Act 6734] authorizing the creation of the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM). However, out of the 13 provinces and 9 cities that participated in the [http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/research/08/10/08/fast-facts-armm-elections plebiscite], only the provinces of [[Lanao del Sur]], [[Maguindanao]], [[Sulu]] and [[Tawi-Tawi]] opted to become part of the ARMM. The ARMM was formally established on 6 November 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unterm.un.org/DGAACS/unterm.nsf/8fa942046ff7601c85256983007ca4d8/7098d74184207a3385256b040066f055?OpenDocument |title=Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=2013-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015020445/http://unterm.un.org/DGAACS/unterm.nsf/8fa942046ff7601c85256983007ca4d8/7098d74184207a3385256b040066f055?OpenDocument |archivedate=2013-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of bringing the Muslim leaders together, this agreement further [https://fas.org/irp/world/para/mnlf.htm fragmented the MNLF] because some factions within the group preferred independence over autonomy. Thus, a group of officers led by [[Hashim Salamat]] [http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/moro.cfm broke away] and formed the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF) to continue their armed struggle for an independent Bangsamoro (Moro nation) in Mindanao.

Though the combined strength of these two rebel forces has not reached a point of posing any real threat to the [[Government of the Philippines|government]] in [[Manila]], their existence—and the reasons for their resilience—certainly brings lots of headaches for the government. For nearly five decades, five [[President of the Philippines|presidents]] have tried to completely end these two rebellions, utilizing both [[Military force|force]] and [[diplomacy]]. So far, no combination has succeeded.

Perhaps the most remarkable effort to bring closure to these movements was that of the [[Fidel V. Ramos|Ramos]] Administration, which tried to reach out to both the communist and Muslim rebels through peaceful means. Ramos sat down with the rebel leaders in an attempt to solve both problems at their roots.

== History of negotiations ==

=== MNLF signs peace pact, fragments the movement ===
Even before being elected president, [[Fidel V. Ramos]] had actively pursued the assistance of foreign Muslim leaders to solve the problem in Mindanao. Thus, he strongly sought the [http://www.mb.com.ph/node/333886/le intercession] of [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi]] because of his instrumental role in the signing of the Tripoli Agreement earlier in 1976. Indeed, with Gaddafi’s assistance, the Philippine government was able to sign the [[1996 Final Peace Agreement|Final Peace Agreement]] &lt;ref&gt;http://mnlfnet.com/The_Final.htm&lt;/ref&gt; with the MNLF in 1996 in what was supposed to be the end of the Moro armed struggle in Mindanao. Misuari was elected governor of the ARMM and was tasked to supervise the implementation of the peace pact.

Unfortunately, other factions within the MNLF were not satisfied with this peace pact and saw this as a deviation from the framework of the Tripoli Agreement. Their desire for complete secession from Philippine sovereignty led to the [http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/moro.cfm establishment of the MILF], which will be another challenge to Ramos’ efforts to bring peace in Mindanao after two decades of negotiations with the MNLF.

=== Ramos negotiates with the MILF, Estrada balks ===
The exploratory and preparatory talks between the government and the MILF started in August 1996, followed by low-level negotiations commencing January the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Soliman Santos.

Ramos’ term as president ended in June 1998, but the low-level negotiations continued under the new administration of President [[Joseph Ejercito-Estrada]]. By October 1999 formal peace talks would commence, only to be suspended by Estrada’s sudden policy-shift by declaring [[2000 Philippine campaign against the Moro Islamic Liberation Front|an "all-out war" against the MILF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/opinion/741415/folly-all-out-war-versus-milf|title= The folly of an all-out war versus the MILF |last=Esposo|first=William|date=2011-10-27|accessdate=2013-10-12|publisher=[[The Philippine Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/236121/news/nation/erap-all-out-war-vs-milf-solution-to-minadanao-conflict|title=Erap: All-out war vs MILF solution to Minadanao conflict|date=2011-10-21|last=Tan|first=Kimberly Jane|accessdate=2013-10-12|publisher=[[GMA News and Public Affairs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, the MILF's chairman Salamat declared jihad against Estrada's administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/abs/inews-oct2000.nsf/provincial/20001006018|title= Estrada swears in 600 MILF surrenderees |date=2000-10-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010923181743/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/abs/inews-oct2000.nsf/provincial/20001006018|archivedate=2001-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estrada’s all-out war policy led to the capture of [[Camp Iranun|Camp Abubakar]], MILF’s main headquarters. The president himself led the military in raising the [[Philippine flag]] in the erstwhile rebel stronghold, bringing trucks of [[lechon]] (roasted pig) and beer for the triumphant soldiers in what was considered as an [http://news.pecojon.ph/?p=783 insult to the MILF]—because pork and alcohol are both prohibited in [[Islam]].

=== Arroyo resumes peace talks ===
When [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] assumed the [[President of the Philippines|presidency]] in January 2001, the [https://books.google.com/books?id=QqgiE94IAmIC&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;vq=moro%20islamic%20liberation%20front&amp;hl=tl&amp;pg=PA46#v=snippet&amp;q=arroyo%20peace%20talks&amp;f=false peace process was revived] with a unilateral declaration of [[ceasefire]] on the part of the government. With the assistance of the [[Malaysian government]], Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process [[Eduardo Ermita]] and MILF Vice-Chair Al Haj Murad Ebrahim signed the [http://www.usip.org/files/file/resources/collections/peace_agreements/implement_guide_08072001.pdf Agreement for the General Framework for the Resumption of Peace Talks] between the government and the MILF.

On March 31, 2001, Republic Act 9054&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2001/ra_9054_2001.html | title=REPUBLIC ACT NO. 9054 | publisher=Lawphil Project | date=March 31, 2001 | accessdate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; lapsed into law without the signature of the president. This law amended the [http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/republic_acts.php?doctype=Republic%20Acts&amp;docid=a45475a11ec72b843d74959b60fd7bd645be80264e701#sam Organic Act of the ARMM] to provide for the region’s expansion from the original four provinces under its jurisdiction. The Provinces of [[Basilan]], [[North Cotabato]], [[Davao del Sur]], [[Lanao del Norte]], [[Palawan]], [[Sarangani]], [[South Cotabato]], [[Sultan Kudarat]], [[Zamboanga del Norte]], [[Zamboanga del Sur]], [[Zamboanga Sibugay]], and the cities of [[Cotabato City|Cotabato]], [[Dapitan]], [[Dipolog]], [[General Santos City|General Santos]], [[Iligan]], [[Marawi]], [[Pagadian]], [[Puerto Princesa]], [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]], [[Digos]], [[Koronadal]], [[Tacurong]], and [[Kidapawan]] participated in the [http://www.newsflash.org/2001/08/ht/ht001965.htm plebiscite]. However, only [[Marawi City]] and [[Basilan]] (excluding [[Isabela, Basilan|Isabela City]]) voted to be included in the ARMM.

Later that year, the peace process fell apart when the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|military]] attacked the MILF just a day after the ancestral domain aspect of the [http://mnlfnet.com/The_Tripoli.htm Tripoli Agreement] was signed in [[Libya]]. This attack was based on intelligence [http://www.southasiaanalysis.org/%5Cpapers8%5Cpaper765.html reports that the MILF has been aiding] the [[Abu Sayyaf]] terrorist group, which at that time held some American and [[Filipino people|Filipino]] hostages in Basilan. A ceasefire would once again ensue after informal talks between the government and the MILF through the intercession of [[Malaysian Government|Malaysia]].

On October 29, 2001, the MILF and the MNLF hold unity talks, but this would fall apart barely a month later when [[Nur Misuari]] [http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/178394/news/nation/makati-court-dismisses-rebellion-case-vs-misuari allegedly led a rebellion] in [[Sulu]] and [[Zamboanga City]] to stall the scheduled ARMM elections. A hundred people died in the incident. The government quelled this rebellion and Misuari escaped to [[Sabah]], but the [[Malaysian government]] later on [http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=141549 deported him back to the Philippines] to face rebellion charges. On May 6, 2002, the fourth round of formal peace talks between the government and the MILF resulted in both parties agreeing to veto criminal syndicates and kidnap-for-ransom groups in Mindanao, and to implement the Humanitarian Rehabilitation and Development aspect of the Tripoli Agreement.

A final draft of the peace accord was presented to the leaders of [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] on February 10, 2003, but on the next day, a setback would ensue as the [http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=198725 military launched an offensive in Buliok Complex] against the MILF which would last for more than a week. Ceasefire was enforced three weeks later. By March, the parties [http://www.yonip.com/archives/BANGSAMORO/Moro-000015.html began exploratory talks in Malaysia] with a commitment from both sides for a “mutual secession of hostilities.” The aspect of a Muslim ancestral domain was laid down as the next agenda for the peace talks. Until the end of 2008, the peace process remained in a deadlock due to constitutional and legal issues surrounding the ancestral domain aspect.

The Malaysian government on the other side have strongly condemn any terrorist activity and expressed unequivocal support for peace negotiations between Moro rebels and the Philippine government rather than helping the rebels as Malaysia did in 1968 after the Jabidah massacre.&lt;ref name="Tan2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew T.

Let us call for a [[jihad]] against [[Poverty in the Philippines|poverty]], against ignorance, against underdevelopment and against prejudice.&lt;ref name="Tan2009"/&gt;}}

=== Muslim Ancestral Domain and the Bangsamoro Juridical Entity ===
On July 27, 2008, a [http://www.muslimmindanao.ph/ancestral_domain1.html Memorandum of Agreement on the Muslim Ancestral Domain] (MOA-AD) was finalized in Malaysia. Under this agreement, some 700 villages in Mindanao would hold a referendum within a year to determine if they intend to join the “Bangsamoro Juridical Entity,” an associated state which would be formed after the necessary constitutional amendments are undertaken by the government. This agreement was scheduled to be signed on August 5, with the final peace agreement set to be concluded by November.

Three days before the scheduled signing of the MOA-AD, local officials of [[North Cotabato]] filed a case asking the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] to block the signing of this agreement. On October 14, the Court voted 8-7 to strike down the MOA-AD as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2008/october2008/183591.htm&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2008/october2008/183591.htm decision] penned by Justice [[Conchita Carpio Morales]], “the [http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/index7.php?doctype=Constitutions&amp;docid=a45475a11ec72b843d74959b60fd7bd64558f82c40d9d#sam Constitution] does not recognize any state within this country other than the Philippine State, much less does it provide for the possibility of any transitory status to prepare any part of Philippine territory for [[independence]].” Likewise, the Court held as unconstitutional the guarantees under the MOA-AD that the government will implement the necessary constitutional amendments to create a framework for its implementation. According to the Court, the peace panel and even the [[President of the Philippines|president]] do not have the authority to make such guarantees because they do not have the power to propose amendments to the Constitution, such power being vested exclusively in [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]].

The junking of the MOA-AD marked another setback for the peace process, with the [http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/169839/news/arroyo-s-peacemaking-legacy-leaves-a-trail-of-blood-and-chaos armed conflicts for the year 2008] reaching a record-high of 30 incidents in Mindanao. In an effort to salvage the negotiations, Arroyo declared the suspension of military operations against the MILF on July 2009.

=== Resumption of peace talks under Aquino Presidency ===
The administration of Benigno Aquino III resumed peace negotiations, the 20th round, with the MILF in February 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12402821|title=Philippines Muslim rebels in talks in Malaysia|last=McGeown|first=Kate|date=2011-02-10|accessdate=2013-10-12|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the rebel group announced that they were [http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/219863/news/nation/milf-drops-secession-plan-on-malaysia-s-advice no longer seeking secession] from the Philippines.

Worst of these attacks came on October 18, 2011 when MILF forces [http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/236312/nation/afp-thumbs-down-all-out-war-vs-milf ambushed an Army contingent] in [[Al-Barka, Basilan]] killing 19 young soldiers and wounding 12 others.

=== Women in the peace process ===
Women played active roles in both the formal and informal negotiations in the [[Mindanao]] peace process that brought an end to open hostilities in 2014. [[Miriam Coronel-Ferrer|Miriam Coronel Ferrer]], who led the Filipino government’s team in peace negotiations with the MILF, made history in becoming the first woman chief negotiator to sign to a major peace accord in history. Women also held a number of meaningful positions on the negotiating teams of both parties to the conflict. Women reportedly fostered communication between different tracks of negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndi.org/files/Gender%20and%20Conflict%20in%20Mindanao.pdf|title=Gender and Conflict in Mindanao|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Democratic Institute|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil society groups and women’s groups conducted listening workshops for Bangsamoro communities and provided recommendations to the official track I negotiation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/2016/03/10/1561218/women-play-key-role-peace-process|title=Women play key role in peace process|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting peace agreement includes a number of gender-specific considerations for transitional governance and women’s empowerment in the future. For example, the agreement includes provisions for women’s inclusion in new institutional mechanisms and suggests that women’s economic participation is a crucial part of a broad national strategy for growth post-conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.c-r.org/accord/legitimacy-and-peace-processes/philippines-women-and-inclusivity-mindanao-peace-process|title=Women play key role in peace process|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro ==
{{Main article|Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro}}
On October 15, 2012, the Philippine government signed a much-hyped document touted as the ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20130116160432/http://pcdspo.gov.ph/downloads/2012/10/20121007-GPH-MILF-Framework-Agreement.pdf Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro]'', which culminates the Aquino Administration's effort to end the deadlock in the peace process. This new document, while merely providing for a general framework for the actual peace negotiations, announces that "the status quo is unacceptable and that the Bangsamoro shall be established to replace the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). The Bangsamoro is the new autonomous political entity (NPE) referred to in the Decision Points of Principles as of April 2012."

According to President [[Benigno Aquino III|Aquino]], this is the agreement that "can finally seal genuine, lasting peace in Mindanao."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.ph/2012/10/15/speech-of-president-aquino-during-the-signing-of-the-gph-milf-framework-agreement-october-15-2012/%20 Speech of President Benigno Aquino III during the signing of the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228173309/http://www.gov.ph/2012/10/15/speech-of-president-aquino-during-the-signing-of-the-gph-milf-framework-agreement-october-15-2012/%20 |date=December 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2014, Philippine government chief negotiator [[Miriam Coronel-Ferrer|Miriam Coronel Ferer]] and  MILF chief negotiator Mohagher Iqbal signed the final annex of the peace agreement in [[Kuala Lumpur]]. Two months later, on March 27, 2014, the [http://www.opapp.gov.ph/resources/comprehensive-agreement-bangsamoro Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro] was signed in Manila and witnessed by Philippine President [[Benigno Aquino III]], MILF Chairman Al Haj Murad Ibrahim, and Malaysian Prime Minister [[Najib Razak]]. The agreement would pave the way for the creation of the new Muslim autonomous entity called "Bangsamoro" under a law to be approved by the Philippine Congress. The government aims to set up the region by 2016. The agreement calls for Muslim self-rule in parts of the southern Philippines in exchange for a deactivation of rebel forces by the MILF. MILF forces would turn over their firearms to a third party to be selected by the MILF and the Philippine government. A regional police force would be established and the Philippine military would reduce the presence of troops and help disband private armies in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/print/391473/|title=Philippine peace breakthrough|date=25 January 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bessarabian Soviet Socialist Republic''' or '''Bessarabian SSR''' ({{lang-ru|Бессарабская Советская Социалистическая Республика, Бессарабская ССР}}) was a failed attempt of the [[Soviet Russia]] to establish its control over territory of historical Bessarabia in 1919. The state with this name never came into existence, apart from a brief [[Tatarbunary Uprising|rebellion]] in September 1924. 

==History==
The BeSSR was proclaimed on May 5, 1919 in [[Odessa]] at the 2nd Regional Bolshevik Conference as a "Provisional Workers' and Peasants' Government in exile" and established on May 11, 1919 in [[Tiraspol]] as an autonomous part of [[Russian SFSR]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Moldova.htm], [http://www.hrono.ru/organ/ru1917.html], [http://www.hrono.ru/organ/russ1917.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Odessa not Tiraspol were part of historical Bessarabia. The planned territories included Tiraspol ''[[uyezd]]'' of [[Kherson Governorate]] and [[Balta, Ukraine|Balta]] and [[Olhopil, Vinnytsia Oblast|Olgopol]] ''uyezds'' of [[Podolia Governorate]] {{Fact|date=February 2007}}. The self-proclaimed government of the Bessarabian SSR never managed to control any part of Bessarabia, which on 9 April 1918 united with [[Romania]]. The [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania]] was not recognized by Soviet authorities and the proclamation of the Bessarabian SSR was a political measure aimed at preparing a future invasion of Bessarabia by the [[Red Army]].

This "government" had talks with the French military authorities over the military and political settlement but was disbanded in September 1919 after [[Denikin]]'s army took control of the Odessa region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proriv.org/page.php?31 ММК «ПРОРЫВ!». Международная молодежная корпорация. Тирасполь. Приднестровье.: Борис Асаров: У Молдовы дорога в никуда&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western European powers recognised the union of Bessarabia and Romania by the [[Treaty of Paris (1920)]]. However, the [[United States]] refused to sign the Treaty on the grounds that [[Russia]] was not represented at the Conference. This aided the [[Soviet Union]] in its continued desire to retake [[Bessarabia]], which it [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|succeeded]] in doing twenty years later.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne S Vucinich, ''Bessarabia'' In: ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]'' (Crowell Collier and MacMillan Inc., 1967) vol. 4, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cambodian genocide denial''' is the belief expressed by some Western academics that claims of [[Cambodian genocide|atrocities by the Khmer Rouge]] government (1975-1979) in Cambodia were much exaggerated. Many scholars of Cambodia and intellectuals, opposed to the U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], denied or minimized the human rights abuses of the Khmer Rouge, characterizing contrary information as "tales told by refugees" and U.S. propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brinkley|first=Joel|title=Cambodia's Curse: The Modern History of a Troubled Land|year=2011|publisher=Public Affairs|pages=48–49|quote=Khmer Rouge apologists easily outnumbered those who believed a tragedy was under way. These people had been vociferous opponents of the [[Vietnam War]]&amp;nbsp;... And to them, whatever the U.S. government had to say now was per force a lie&amp;nbsp;... Before the subcommittee, Porter said simply that it was 'a myth that between one million and two million Cambodians have been victims of a regime led by genocidal maniacs.'&amp;nbsp;... A few weeks earlier [[Noam Chomsky]], an author and academic, offered an article in the ''Nation'' that conflated the American bombing and the Khmer Rouge horrors and made the same broad argument as the other apologists. He cited 'highly qualified specialists' whom he did not name, but 'who have studied the full range of evidence available, and who have concluded that executions numbered at most in the thousands.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They viewed the assumption of power by the [[communist]] Khmer Rouge as a positive development for the people of Cambodia who had been severely impacted by the Vietnam War and the [[Cambodian Civil War]].

On the other side of the argument, [[anti-Communists in the United States]] and elsewhere saw in the rule of the Khmer Rouge vindication of their belief that the victory of communist governments in South-East Asia would lead to a "bloodbath".

Scholar Donald W. Beachler, writing of the controversy about the range and extent of Khmer Rouge atrocities, concluded that "much of the posturing by academics, publicists, and politicians seems to have been motivated largely by political purposes" rather than concern for the Cambodian people.&lt;ref name="Beachler, Donald W. 2009 p. 214, 215"&gt;Beachler, Donald W. (2009) "Arguing about Cambodia:  Genocide and Political Interest" ''Holocaust and Genocide Studies'', Vol. 23, No. 2, Fall 2009, p. 214, 215&lt;/ref&gt;

With conclusive evidence (including the discovery of over 20,000 mass graves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seybolt|first1=Taylor B.|last2=Aronson|first2=Jay D.|last3=Fischoff|first3=Baruch|title=Counting Civilian Casualties: An Introduction to Recording and Estimating Nonmilitary Deaths in Conflict|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199977314|p=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;) of a large number of deaths—estimated at between one and three million—of Cambodians caused by the Khmer Rouge, denials, deniers, and apologists largely disappeared, although disagreements concerning the actual number of Khmer Rouge victims have continued. 

Against the background of the [[Cambodian-Vietnamese War|Vietnamese invasion and occupation of Cambodia]] (1978-1979), the [[United States]] practiced what the [[Washington Post]] called "hold-your-nose diplomacy", recognizing the Khmer Rouge as the legitimate government of Cambodia while abhoring the "record of genocide" of the Khmer Rouge. The U.S. policy was in solidarity with [[China]], [[Thailand]], and other South East Asian countries who opposed the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;"Hold-Your-Nose Diplomacy", ''Washington Post'', September 17, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Khmer Rouge captured [[Phnom Penh]], the capital of Cambodia, on April 17, 1975 and immediately ordered all the residents to evacuate the city. "Between two and three million residents of Phnom Penh, [[Battambang]], and other big towns were forced by the communists to walk into the countryside&amp;nbsp;... without organized provision for food, water, shelter, physical security or medical care."&lt;ref&gt;"Cambodia's Crime" ''The New York Times'', July 9, 1975, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The evacuation probably resulted in at least 100,000 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Larry Clinton ''Refugee Workers in the Indochina Exodus, 1975-1982'' Jefferson, NC  and London: MacFarland, 2010, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;  The dispossessed urban dwellers were assigned to re-education camps or "New Settlements."  Former government employees and soldiers were executed. Soon, according to journalists, Cambodia resembled "a giant prison camp with the urban supporters of the [[Khmer Republic|former regime]] being worked to death on thin gruel and hard labor."&lt;ref&gt;"Cambodia's Crime"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Khmer Rouge guarded the border with Thailand and only a few thousand refugees were able to make their way to Thailand and safety.  As virtually no Westerners were allowed to visit Cambodia, those refugees plus the official news outlets of the Khmer Rouge were the principal sources of information about conditions in Cambodia for the next four years.

==The "Standard Total Academic View on Cambodia" (STAV)==
Beachler has described the late 1970s debate about the character of the Khmer Rouge. "Many of those who had been opponents of U.S. military actions in Vietnam and Cambodia feared that the tales of murder and deprivation under the Khmer Rouge regime would validate the claims of those who had supported U.S. government actions aimed at halting the spread of communism. Conservatives pointed to the actions of the Khmer Rouge as proof of the inherent evils of communism and evidence that the U.S. had been right to fight its long war against communists in Southeast Asia&amp;nbsp;... "&lt;ref name="Beachler, Donald W. 2009 p. 214, 215"/&gt;
  
Despite the eye-witness accounts by journalists prior to their expulsion during the first few days of Khmer Rouge rule, and the later testimony of refugees; many academics in the United States, [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Australia]] and other countries portrayed the Khmer Rouge favorably or at least were skeptical about the stories of Khmer Rouge atrocities. None of them, however, were allowed to visit Cambodia until the final few days of Khmer Rouge rule (except [[Cambodian genocide#Gunnar Bergström and the SKFA|Gunnar Bergstrom]], president of the SKFA) and few actually talked to the refugees whose stories they believed to be exaggerated or false.&lt;ref name="Canon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wrong answers"/&gt;

Some Western scholars believed that the Khmer Rouge would free Cambodia from colonialism, capitalism, and the ravages of American bombing and invasion during the Vietnam War.  Cambodian scholar [[Sophal Ear]] has titled the pro-Khmer Rouge academics as the "Standard Total Academic View on Cambodia" (STAV).  The STAV, which he said included among its adherents almost all Cambodian scholars in the Western world, "hoped for, more than anything, a socialist success story with all the romantic ingredients of peasants, fighting imperialism, and revolution."&lt;ref name="Canon"&gt;"Sophal Ear ''The Khmer Rouge Canon, 1975-1979,'' http://www.paulbogdanor.com/deniers/cambodia/canon.pdf, accessed December 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Author [[William Shawcross]] was another critic of the STAV academics.  Shawcross's views were endorsed and summarized by human rights activist David Hawk: the West was indifferent to the atrocities taking place in Cambodia due to "the influence of anti-war academics on the American left who obfuscated Khmer Rouge behavior, denigrated the post-1975 refugee reports, and denounced the journalists who got those stories."&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Edward S. and Chomsky, Noam ''Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media'' New York: Random House, 1988, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy concerning the Khmer Rouge intensified in February 1977 with the publication of excerpts from a book by [[John Barron (journalist)|John Barron]] and Anthony Paul in ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' magazine. Based on extensive interviews with Cambodian refugees in Thailand, Barron and Paul estimated that, out of a total population of about 7 million people, 1.2 million Cambodians had died of starvation, over-work, or execution during less than two years of Khmer Rouge rule.&lt;ref&gt;Barron, John and Paul, Anthony ''Murder of a Gentle Land: The Untold Story of a Communist Genocide in Cambodia'' New York: Reader's Digest Press, 1977, pp. 201-206&lt;/ref&gt;  Published about the same time was [[François Ponchaud]]'s book, ''Cambodia: Year Zero.'' Ponchaud, a French priest, had lived in Cambodia and spoke [[Khmer language|Khmer]].  He also painted a picture of mass deaths caused by the Khmer Rouge. French scholar, [[Jean Lacouture]], formerly a sympathizer of the Khmer Rouge, reviewed Ponchaud's book favorably in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' on March 31, 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1977/03/31/the-bloodiest-revolution/|author=Lacouture, Jean|title=The Bloodiest Revolution|work=The New York Review of Books|date=31 March 1977|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solarz hearing==
On May 3, 1977, Congressman [[Stephen Solarz]] led a hearing on Cambodia in the [[United States House of Representatives]].  The witnesses were Barron and three academics who specialized in Cambodia: [[David P. Chandler]], who would become perhaps the most prominent American scholar of Cambodia, Peter Poole, and [[Gareth Porter]].  Chandler believed that "bloodbath" was an accurate description of the situation and by no means an exaggeration.&lt;ref name="Maguire2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Maguire|title=Facing Death in Cambodia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nNfu_0Xafo8C&amp;pg=PA53|date=19 June 2012|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-50939-8|pages=53–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Porter stated that the tales of Khmer Rouge atrocities were much exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;Rodayne, Peter ''Never Again?: The United States and Punishment of Genocide since the Holocaust'' Washington: Rowman and Littlefield, 2001, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  Porter was the most outspoken of the academics. He had co-authored (with George Hildebrand) ''Cambodia: Starvation and Revolution'', a highly positive book about the Khmer Rouge. Porter characterized the accounts of a million or more dead Cambodians as wildly exaggerated.  He said, "I cannot accept the premise&amp;nbsp;... that 1 million people have been murdered systematically or that the Government of Cambodia is systematically slaughtering its people."&lt;ref&gt;"Hearing Before the Subcommittee on International Organizations of the Committee on International Relations, House of Representatives, Ninety-fifth Congress, First Session, on: Human Rights in Cambodia,  03 May 1977, Folder 02, Box 12, Douglas Pike Collection: Unit 11 - Monographs, The Vietnam Center and Archive, Texas Tech University, pp. 34  Accessed 6 May. 2014. &lt;http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/virtualarchive/items.php?item=2391202002&gt;.ns, May 3, 1977, pp 33-35 http://www.virtual.vietnam.ttu.edu/cgi-bin/starfetch.exe?y5YIHw.Ap9jQF7zpHs@CdSZQd2YPGf1bR.xqGOxP5YTnDP45riAiTktrK1t3nHMYKZRiGN@pVhOvFweX3jfFUJHualVu0Mr0po@xezRxjKY/2391202002D.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He described the stories by refugees of Khmer Rouge atrocities collected by Barron and others as second-hand and hearsay.  Asked for his sources, Porter cited the works of another adherent of the STAV, [[Ben Kiernan]], who as a student was an editor for a pro-Khmer Rouge publication in Australia. Porter never mentioned having spoken to any Cambodian refugees to evaluate their stories personally.

Solarz, who had visited Cambodian refugee camps and listened to refugees' stories of Khmer Rouge atrocities, characterized justifications and explanations during the hearing about the Khmer Rouge as "cowardly and contemptible" and compared them to the justifications of the murder of Jews by [[Adolf Hitler]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 130-138&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chomsky and Herman==
Academics [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Edward S. Herman]] were among those who examined the conflicting reports of the situation in Cambodia in 1977. On June 6, 1977, Chomsky and Herman published an article in ''[[The Nation]]'' which contrasted the views expressed in books by Barron and Paul, Ponchaud, and Porter and Hildebrand, and in articles and accounts by Butterfield, Bragg, Kahin, Cazaux, Shanberg, Tolgraven and others. Their conclusion was: "We do not pretend to know where the truth lies amidst these sharply conflicting assessments; rather, we again want to emphasize some crucial points. What filters through to the American public is a seriously distorted version of the evidence available, emphasizing alleged Khmer Rouge atrocities and downplaying or ignoring the crucial U.S. role, direct and indirect, in the torment that Cambodia has suffered."&lt;ref name="nation"&gt;Chomsky, Noam and Herman, Edward S. "Distortions at Fourth Hand" ''The Nation'', June 6, 1977 http://www.chomsky.info/articles/19770625.htm, accessed 25 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky and Herman noted the conflicting information in the various accounts, and suggested that after the "failure of the American effort to subdue South Vietnam and to crush the mass movements elsewhere in Indochina" there was now "a campaign to reconstruct the history of these years so as to place the role of the United States in a more favorable light". This rewriting of history by the establishment press was served well by "tales of Communist atrocities, which not only prove the evils of communism but undermine the credibility of those who opposed the war and might interfere with future crusades for freedom."  They wrote that the refugee stories of Khmer Rouge atrocities should be treated with great "care and caution" because "refugees are frightened and defenseless, at the mercy of alien forces. They naturally tend to report what they believe their interlocuters wish to hear."&lt;ref name="nation"/&gt;

In support of their assertion, Chomsky and Herman criticized Barron and Paul's book ''Murder of a Gentle Land'' for ignoring the U.S. government's role in creating the situation, saying, "When they speak of 'the murder of a gentle land,' they are not referring to B-52 attacks on villages or the systematic bombing and murderous ground sweeps by American troops or forces organized and supplied by the United States, in a land that had been largely removed from the conflict prior to the American attack". They give several examples to show that Barron and Paul's "scholarship collapses under the barest scrutiny," and they conclude that, "It is a fair generalization that the larger the number of deaths attributed to the Khmer Rouge, and the more the U.S. role is set aside, the larger the audience that will be reached. The Barron-Paul volume is a third-rate propaganda tract, but its exclusive focus on Communist terror assures it a huge audience."&lt;ref name="nation"/&gt;

Chomsky and Herman had both praise and criticism for Ponchaud's book ''Year Zero'', writing that it was "serious and worth reading" and "the serious reader will find much to make him somewhat wary."&lt;ref name="nation"/&gt; In the introduction to the American edition of his book, Ponchaud responded to a personal letter from Chomsky, saying, "He [Chomsky] wrote me a letter on October 19, 1977 in which he drew my attention to the way it [''Year Zero''] was being misused by anti-revolutionary propagandists.  He has made it my duty to 'stem the flood of lies' about Cambodia -- particularly, according to him, those propagated by Anthony Paul and John Barron in ''Murder of a Gentle Land.''"&lt;ref&gt;Ponchaud, Francois ''Cambodia: Year Zero'' New York: Henry Holt &amp; Co., 1978, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

A different response appeared in the British introduction to Ponchaud's book. &lt;blockquote&gt; "Even before this book was translated it was sharply criticized by Mr Noam Chomsky [reference to correspondence with Silvers and the review cited in note 100] and Mr Gareth Porter [reference to ''May Hearings'']. These two 'experts' on Asia claim that I am mistakenly trying to convince people that Cambodia was drowned in a sea of blood after the departure of the last American diplomats. They say there have been no massacres, and they lay the blame for the tragedy of the Khmer people on the American bombings. They accuse me of being insufficiently critical in my approach to the refugee's accounts. For them, refugees are not a valid source&amp;nbsp;... "After an investigation of this kind, it is surprising to see that 'experts' who have spoken to few if any refugees should reject their very significant place in any study of modern Cambodia. These experts would rather base their arguments on reasoning: if something seems impossible to their personal logic, then it doesn't exist. Their only sources for evaluation are deliberately chosen official statements. Where is that critical approach which they accuse others of not having?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|last2=Herman|first2=Edward|title=After the Cataclysm: Postwar Indochina and the Reconstruction of Imperial Ideology|year=1979|publisher=South End Press|page=278-279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
 
Cambodia scholar Bruce Sharp criticized Chomsky and Herman's ''Nation'' article, as well as their subsequent work ''After the Cataclysm (1979)'', saying that while Chomsky and Herman added disclaimers about knowing the truth of the matter, and about the nature of the regimes in Indochina, they nevertheless expressed a set of views by their comments and their use of various sources. For instance, Chomsky portrayed Porter and Hildebrand's book as "a carefully documented study of the destructive American impact on Cambodia and the success of the Cambodian revolutionaries in overcoming it, giving a very favorable picture of their programs and policies, based on a wide range of sources." Sharp, however, found that 33 out of 50 citations in one chapter of Porter and Hildebrand's book derived from the Khmer Rouge government and six from China, the Khmer Rouge's principal supporter.&lt;ref name="Wrong answers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mekong.net/cambodia/chomsky.htm|author=Sharp, Bruce|title=Averaging Wrong Answers: Noam Chomsky and the Cambodian Controversy|work=mekong.net|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Veteran Cambodia correspondent [[Nate Thayer]] said of Chomsky and Herman's ''Nation'' article that they "denied the credibility of information leaking out of Cambodia of a bloodbath underway and viciously attacked the authors of reportage suggesting many were suffering under the Khmer Rouge."&lt;ref&gt;"Thayer, Nate, "Khmer Rouge Apologist Noam Chomsky: Unrepentant",  http://natethayer.typepad.com/blog/2011/11/khmer-rouge-apologist-noam-chomsky-unrepentant-.html, accessed 1 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Andrew Anthony in the London ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'', said later that the Porter and Hildebrand's book "cravenly rehashed the Khmer Rouge's most outlandish lies to produce a picture of a kind of radical bucolic idyll."  Chomsky, he said, questioned "refugee testimony" believing that "their stories were exaggerations or fabrications, designed for a western media involved in a 'vast and unprecedented propaganda campaign' against the Khmer Rouge government, 'including systematic distortion of the truth.'"&lt;ref name="Andrew"/&gt;

Beachler cited reports that Chomsky's attempts to counter charges of Khmer Rouge atrocities also consisted of writing letters to editors and publications. He said: "Examining materials in the Documentation Center of Cambodia archives, American commentator Peter Maguire found that Chomsky wrote to publishers such as Robert Silver of the [[New York Review of Books]] to urge discounting atrocity stories. Maguire reports that some of these letters were as long as twenty pages, and that they were even sharper in tone than Chomsky’s published words."&lt;ref&gt;Beachler, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Fred Barnes (journalist)|Fred Barnes]] also mentioned that Chomsky had written "a letter or two" to the New York Review of Books.  Barnes discussed the Khmer Rouge with Chomsky and "the thrust of what he [Chomsky] said was that there was no evidence of mass murder" in Cambodia. Chomsky, according to Barnes, believed that "tales of holocaust in Cambodia were so much propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens, Christopher, "The Chorus and Cassandra: What Everyone Knows about Noam Chomsky" ''Grand Steet'', Vol. 5, No. 1 (Autumn 1985), p. 118.  Downloaded from [[JSTOR]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]] defended Chomsky and Herman.  They "were engaged in the admittedly touchy business of distinguishing evidence from interpretations."&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens, p.. 116.  Downloaded from [[JSTOR]].&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky and Herman have continued to argue that their analysis of the situation in Cambodia was reasonable based on the information available to them at the time, and a legitimate critique of the disparities in reporting atrocities committed by communist regimes relative to the atrocities committed by the U.S. and its allies.

==Murder of Malcolm Caldwell==
[[Malcolm Caldwell]] was a British academic who wrote extensively about Cambodia, including, a few months before his death, an article in ''The Guardian'' denying reports of Khmer Rouge genocide.&lt;ref name="Andrew"/&gt;  Caldwell was a member of the first delegation of three Western writers, two Americans, [[Elizabeth Becker]] and [[Richard Dudman]], and Caldwell, to be invited to visit Cambodia in December 1978—nearly four years after the Khmer Rouge had taken power.  The invitation was apparently an effort by [[Pol Pot]], leader of the Khmer Rouge, to improve the image of the Khmer Rouge in the West, now questioned by some of its former academic sympathizers.&lt;ref name="Andrew"&gt;[[Andrew Anthony|Anthony, Andrew]], [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jan/10/malcolm-caldwell-pol-pot-murder Lost in Cambodia], ''The Guardian'', January 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;   On December 22, Caldwell had a private meeting with Pol Pot and returned "euphoric" to the guest house in [[Phnom Penh]] where the three members of the delegation were staying.  During the night Becker awoke to the sound of gunfire and saw a Cambodian man with a gun in the guest house outside her room.  Later that night she and Dudman were allowed by guards to venture out of their rooms and they discovered Caldwell's body.  He had been shot.  The body of a Cambodian man was also in his room.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Elizabeth, ''When the War was Over: Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge Revolution'' New York: Public Affairs Books, 1998, pp. 426-430&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The murder of Caldwell has never been fully explained.  Four of the Cambodian guards were arrested and two "confessed" under torture. They said, "We were attacking to ruin the Khmer Rouge Party's policy, to prevent the Party from gathering friends in the world&amp;nbsp;... it would be enough to attack the English guest, because the English guest had written in support of our Party&amp;nbsp;... Therefore, we must absolutely succeed in attacking this English guest, in order that the American guests would write about it."   Whatever the motive behind Caldwell's murder, it seems highly unlikely that it could have occurred in tightly-controlled Cambodia without the involvement of high-level Khmer Rouge officials.&lt;ref name="Andrew"/&gt;

The impact of Caldwell's visit to Cambodia and his murder was muted by the [[Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese War|Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia]] three days later on December 25, 1978, which soon ended the rule of the Khmer Rouge. Support for the Khmer Rouge in the Western academic community of Cambodian scholars quietly faded away. [[Peter W. Rodman|Peter Rodman]], an American foreign policy expert and public official, stated that "When [[Hanoi]] [Vietnam] turned publicly against Phnom Penh, it suddenly became respectable for many on the Left to 'discover' the murderous qualities of the Khmer Rouge &amp;mdash; qualities that had been obvious to unbiased observers for years."&lt;ref&gt;Rodman, Peter "The Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978: Grantsmanship &amp; the Killing Fields", ''Commentary'', March 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gunnar Bergström and the SKFA==
In August 1978, the [[Sweden|Swede]] Gunnar Bergström, who was then president of the SKFA ([[Sweden-Kampuchea Friendship Association]]) as well as  one of the Khmer Rouge's most ardent supporters,&lt;ref name=former_khmer&gt;https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/former-khmer-rouge-supporter-gives-talk-students&lt;/ref&gt; was the only Westerner allowed to visit [[Democratic Kampuchea]] together with three other [[Sweden|Swedes]]. They also had dinner with [[Pol Pot]].&lt;ref name=voacambodia&gt;https://www.voacambodia.com/a/digesting-the-details-long-after-a-dinner-with-pol-pot/3535973.html&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, Gunnar Bergström was just 27 years old and he was an idealist and a leftist, truly believing that the reports about overwork, starvation and mass killings in Cambodia were just "Western propaganda".&lt;ref name=cambodiatokampuchea_gb&gt;https://cambodiatokampuchea.wordpress.com/2015/08/17/gunnar-bergstrom/&lt;/ref&gt; They saw "smiling peasants", a society on its way to become "an ideal society, ...with no oppressors". When they came back to Sweden, they "undertook a speaking tour and wrote articles in support of the [[Democratic Kampuchea]] regime".&lt;ref name=cambodiatokampuchea_gb/&gt;

Evidence that emerged after the fall of the regime shocked Bergström, forcing him to change his views. He said that it was "like falling off the branch of the tree" and that he had to re-identify everything he had believed in.&lt;ref name=cambodiatokampuchea_gb/&gt; In later interviews, he acknowledged that he had been wrong, that it was a "propaganda tour" and that they were brought to see what they wanted them to see.&lt;ref name=former_khmer/&gt;&lt;ref name=cambodiatokampuchea_gb/&gt;

After then, Gunnar Bergström went back to Cambodia for a "big forgiveness tour".&lt;ref name=former_khmer/&gt; In a speech with high school students in [[Phnom Penh]] on 12 September 2016, he recommended that everybody should learn history and he stated that a peaceful communist revolution is simply not possible.&lt;ref name=cambodiatokampuchea_gb/&gt;

==Recanting==
With the takeover of Cambodia by Vietnam in 1979 and the discovery of incontestable evidence of Khmer Rouge atrocities, including mass graves, the "tales told by refugees", which had been doubted by many Western academics, proved to be entirely accurate. Some former enthusiasts for the Khmer Rouge recanted their previous views, others diverted their interest to other issues, and a few continued to defend the Khmer Rouge.&lt;ref name="Canon"/&gt;

In a caustic exchange with William Shawcross in ''The New York Review of Books'' on July 20, 1978, Gareth Porter wrote that, "It is true, as Shawcross notes from my May 1977 Congressional testimony, that I have changed my view on a number of aspects of the Cambodian situation. I have no interest in defending everything the Khmer government does, and I believe that the policy of self-reliance has been carried so far that it has imposed unnecessary costs on the population of Cambodia. Shawcross, however, clearly does have an interest in rejecting our conclusions. It is time, I suggest, for him to examine it carefully, because it does not make for intellectual honesty."  Shawcross responded, "I was glad to acknowledge in my article that Mr. Porter had changed his views on the Khmer Rouge and it is a tribute to his own integrity that he now agrees that the Khmer Rouge have imposed 'unnecessary costs' on the Cambodian people. He should, however, be a little more careful before he accuses others of deliberately falsifying evidence and of intellectual dishonesty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1978/07/20/an-exchange-on-cambodia/|title=An Exchange on Cambodia|work=The New York Review of Books|date=20 July 1978|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Porter said he had been waiting many years for someone to ask him about his earlier views of the Khmer Rouge. He described how the climate of distrust of the government generated during the Vietnam War carried over to Cambodia. "I uncovered a series of instances when government officials were propagandizing [about the Vietnam War]. They were lying," he explained.  "I've been well aware for many years that I was guilty of intellectual arrogance. I was right about the bloodbath in Vietnam, so I assumed I would be right about Cambodia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brinkley|first=Joel|title=Cambodia's Curse: The Modern History of a Troubled Land|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian Ben Kiernan recanted after interviewing 500 Cambodian refugees in 1979.  He admitted that he had been "late in recognizing the extent of the tragedy in Cambodia&amp;nbsp;... and "wrong about&amp;nbsp;... the brutal authoritarian trend within the revolutionary movement after 1973."&lt;ref&gt;Sophal Ear, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opinion of Donald W. Beachler, the genocide deniers and doubters among academics may have been motivated more by politics than a search for the truth, but conservatives who "embraced the reports" of Khmer Rouge atrocities had no less "cynicism or naiveté" in later downplaying reports of atrocities by anti-communists in [[Central America]].&lt;ref&gt;Beachler, 232&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that the supportive attitude towards the Khmer Rouge had also been expressed by the U.S. government and politicians for a dozen years after the regime was toppled in January 1979, as part of the denigration against the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia in the 1980s. In fact, the U.S. was one of the countries that voted for the retainment of the [[Democratic Kampuchea]]'s seat at the [[United Nations]] until 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beachler|first=Donald W.|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-west-missed-the-horrors-of-cambodia|title=How the West Missed the Horrors of Cambodia|work=The Daily Beast|date=May 9, 2016|accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Sharp, who points out many errors of Chomsky's analysis, also says that "While Chomsky's comments on Cambodia are misleading and inaccurate, one important point must be borne in mind: The actions of the United States were largely responsible for the growth of the Khmer Rouge."&lt;ref name="Wrong answers"/&gt;

Certain authors have continued to downplay Khmer Rouge atrocities in recent years. Richard Dudman, who accompanied Caldwell to Cambodia, challenged the "conventional wisdom that Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge are irrational fanatics who practiced deliberate genocide [and] slaughtered more than one million Cambodians" in a 1990 ''New York Times'' editorial, arguing that "The evidence for these fixed beliefs consists mainly of poignant though statistically inconclusive anecdotes from accounts of mass executions in a few villages. It comes mostly from those with an interest in blackening the name of the Khmer Rouge: From Cambodian refugees, largely the middle- and upper-class victims of the Pol Pot revolution, and from the Vietnamese".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dudman|first=Richard|url=http://www.paulbogdanor.com/deniers/cambodia/dudman.pdf|title=Pol Pot: Brutal, Yes, but No Mass Murderer|work=The New York Times|date=August 17, 1990|accessdate=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, journalist [[Israel Shamir]] wrote an article titled "Pol Pot Revisited" for the American left-wing newsletter ''[[CounterPunch]]'' in which he argued:
 	
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"New Cambodia (or Kampuchea, as it was called) under Pol Pot and his comrades was a nightmare for the privileged, for the wealthy and for their retainers; but poor people had enough food and were taught to read and write. As for the mass killings, these are just horror stories, averred my Cambodian interlocutors. Surely the victorious peasants shot marauders and spies, but many more died of American-planted mines and during the subsequent Vietnamese takeover, they said&amp;nbsp;... Noam Chomsky assessed that the death toll in Cambodia may have been inflated 'by a factor of a thousand'...&amp;nbsp; To me, this recalls other CIA-sponsored stories of Red atrocities, be it [[Great Purge|Stalin's Terror]] or the Ukrainian [[Holodomor]]&amp;nbsp;... [The Vietnamese] supported the black legend of genocide to justify their own bloody intervention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shamir|first=Israel|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/09/18/pol-pot-revisited/|title=Pol Pot Revisited|work=CounterPunch|date=2012-09-18|accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2013, the Cambodian Prime Minister [[Hun Sen]] passed legislation which makes illegal the denial of the Cambodian genocide and other war crimes committed by the Khmer Rouge. The legislation was passed after comments by a member of the opposition, [[Kem Sokha]], who is the deputy president of the [[Cambodian National Rescue Party]]. Sokha had stated that exhibits at Tuol Sleng were fabricated and that the artifacts had been faked by the Vietnamese following their invasion in 1979. Sokha's party have claimed that the comments have been taken out of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buncombe|first=Andrew|title=Cambodia passes law making denial of Khmer Rouge genocide illegal|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/cambodia-passes-law-making-denial-of-khmer-rouge-genocide-illegal-8649701.html|accessdate=2014-01-02|newspaper=The Independent|date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputing the number of Khmer Rouge victims==
Estimates of the number of Cambodians who died during the four years of Khmer Rouge rule have been controversial and range from less than one million to more than three million. Kiernan, head of the Cambodian Genocide Project at [[Yale University]], estimated that the Khmer Rouge were responsible for 1.5 million deaths and later raised that estimate to 1.7 million, more than 20 percent of the population. His deputy, Craig Etcheson, undertook the most complete survey of mass graves and evidence of executions in Cambodia and concluded in 1999 that the Khmer Rouge may have executed as many as 1.5 million people and as many as another 1.5 million may have died of starvation and overwork. Kiernan criticized Etcheson for "sloppiness, exaggerating a horrific death toll", and "ethnic auctioneering". Etcheson's report was removed from the web site of the Cambodian Genocide Project.&lt;ref&gt;Kiernan, Ben. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1467271032000147041 "The Demography of Genocide in Southeast Asia,"] ''Critical Asian Studies'', Vol. 35, No. 4 (2003), pp. 587-588; accessed December 3, 2016; Thompson, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6319">The '''Center for Engaged Democracy''' is located within [[Merrimack College]]’s School of Education.  The Center develops, coordinates, and supports academic programs around the country that are focused on civic and community engagement.  The Center supports such academic programs through a variety of initiatives for faculty, administrators, and community partners.  There are currently over fifty academic programs focused on community engagement.&lt;ref&gt;“Center for an Engaged Democracy”. Retrieved from www.merrimack.edu/democracy&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Center was founded in 2010 by Dan Sarofian-Butin.  His research and academic work for over five years has been focused on the argument for the institutionalization of [[community engagement]] in higher education. He says that we need to reconceptualize the [[service-learning]] movement as an intellectual movement to make meaningful connections between colleges and communities and expand on the notion of an engaged campus. This shows the need to develop an "academic home" meaning academic programs such as majors, minors, certificates and interdisciplinary programs. His research is the reason for the development of this central research and action hub to develop, coordinate, and support academic programs that are focused on community engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.danbutin.net/research.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121190147/http://www.danbutin.net/research.html |archivedate=2014-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Center Initiatives==

===Compilation===

The Center is currently compiling existing research and documentation to support new and developing programs.  The document repository has the following resources:
*Strategic Planning Resources
*Course Catalog Resource
*Key Texts in Community Engagement
*Syllabus Resource
The repository is currently housed on the Center for Engaged Democracy website.&lt;ref&gt;"Center for Engaged Democracy." Retrieved from: http://www.engageddemocracy.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Core Competencies Initiative===

An outcome of the 3rd Annual Summer Institute was a working paper in the Center for Engaged Democracy's Policy Papers Series, entitled Core Competencies In Civic Engagement. Developed by individuals from seven institutions and organizations the working paper synthesizes existing program competencies and resources for the community engagement field. The goal of this initiative remains to distill common competencies and propose a suggested list of core competencies for academic programs. The Core Competencies specifically address the following questions:
* What are the learning outcomes for academic programs in "community engagement"?
* What knowledge, skills, and dispositions should students have demonstrated by the end of their academic programs?
* How should these competencies differ across diverse programs - certificates, minors, and majors?

===Summer Conference===
The Center sponsors a yearly summer research institute for departments and academic programs.  This conference brings together scholars, students, and community participants to engage critical questions of what it means in higher education to have an “academic home” for community engagement. In June 2011, the 2nd Annual Summer Research Institute hosted Keynote Speaker Benjamin Barber. The 3rd annual summer conference was held on June 23–24 at the campus of Merrimack College&lt;ref&gt;"Events." Retrieved from: http://ase.tufts.edu/macc/events.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research Opportunities===
In September 2011, the Center had a Call for Proposals for research on academic programs in community engagement.  This request was to advance the research on academic programs in community engagement.

Rick Battistoni ([[Providence College]]), Arthur Keene ([[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]), Tania Mitchell ([[Stanford University]]), and John Reiff ([[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]) received the Center’s first research grant.  Their research project is called Educating for Democratic Leadership in Three Multi-Year, Development, Cohort-Based [[Civic Engagement]] Programs.  This project will investigate the long-term impacts of sustained, developmental community action programs at Providence College, Stanford University and the University of Massachusetts to understand how these programs influence civic identity and civic action and promote democratic leadership after college. Their findings will be presented at the 2012 summer research institute

The '''Chief Whip of the Liberal Democrats''' is responsible for administering the [[Whip (politics)|whipping system]] in the party which ensures that members attend and vote in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]] when the [[Leader of the Liberal Democrats|party leadership]] requires a majority vote. Whips, of which two are appointed in the party, a member of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and a member of the [[House of Lords]] also help to organise their party’s contribution to parliamentary business. On some occasions, the party leadership may allow MP's to have a [[Conscience vote|free vote]] based on their own conscience rather than party policy, of which the chief whip is not required to direct votes.

This is a list of people who have served as [[Chief Whip]] of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] and of its predecessor parties. The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] was formed in 1859, but through its roots in the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig Party]] dates back to the late 1670s. In 1988, the Liberals merged with the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]], formed by dissident [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] members in 1981, to create the Liberal Democrats.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8743">A '''democratic republic''' is a [[form of government]] operating on principles adopted from a [[republic]] and a [[democracy]]. Rather than being a cross between two entirely separate systems, democratic republics may function on principles shared by both republics and democracies.

==Theory==
Common definitions of the terms ''democracy'' and ''republic'' often feature overlapping concerns, suggesting that many democracies function as republics, and many republics operate on democratic principles, as shown by these definitions from the Oxford dictionary online:
* '''Republic''': "A state in which supreme power is held by the people and their elected representatives..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/republic|title=republic {{!}} Definition of republic in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Democracy''': "A system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/democracy|title=democracy {{!}} Definition of democracy in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Eugene Volokh of the UCLA School of Law notes that the United States exemplifies the varied nature of a democratic republic{{Mdash}}a country where some decisions (often local) are made by direct democratic processes, while others (often federal) are made by democratically elected representatives.&lt;ref name="volokh"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/13/is-the-united-states-of-america-a-republic-or-a-democracy/|title=Is the United States of America a republic or a democracy?|last=Volokh|first=Eugene|date=2015-05-13|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with many large systems, US governance is incompletely described by any single term. It also employs the concept, for instance, of a [[constitutional democracy]] in which a court system is involved in matters of [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref name="volokh" /&gt;

As with other democracies, not all persons in a democratic republic are necessarily citizens, and not all citizens are necessarily entitled to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Characteristics of Democratic Republic|url=http://www.governmentvs.com/en/democratic-republic-definition/model-41-11|website=Government VS|publisher=softUsvista Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suffrage]] is commonly restricted by criteria such as [[voting age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usa.gov/voter-registration-age-requirements|title=Voter Registration Age Requirements by State|last=|first=|date=|website=USA.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the US, the notion that a republic was a form of democracy was common from the time of its founding, and the concepts associated with representative democracy (and hence with a democratic republic) are suggested by John Adams (writing in 1784):&lt;blockquote&gt;No determinations are carried, it is true, in a simple representative democracy, but by consent of the majority or their representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGUSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=%22in+a+simple+or+representative+democracy+but+by+consent+of+the+majority%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n8CmlhN3ZE&amp;sig=ekBM4Ghfdy69XTh2qaep8LohzbU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZY-_S4bjG4LjnAeV9tT3CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22in%20a%20simple%20or%20representative%20democracy%20but%20by%20consent%20of%20the%20majority%22&amp;f=false|title=The Works of John Adams, Second President of the United States: With a Life of the Author, Notes and Illustrations|last=Adams|first=John|date=1851|publisher=Little, Brown|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Historically, some inconsistency around the term is frequent. [[China]] claims to be the oldest of Asia's democratic republics, though its recent history of democratic process is largely linked only to [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=acK1AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA246&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;dq=%22oldest+democratic+republic%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vwzR6TG3Fu&amp;sig=53pdeaOtMV_hY5mRNMesm-IMhnQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB0OjP7u7XAhVV02MKHak5CB0Q6AEINTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22oldest%20democratic%20republic%22&amp;f=false|title=Parliaments in Asia: Institution Building and Political Development|last=Yongnian|first=Zheng|last2=Fook|first2=Lye Liang|last3=Hofmeister|first3=Wilhelm|date=2013-10-23|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134469659|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Africa's oldest democratic republic, [[Liberia]] (formed in 1822), has had its political stability rocked by periodic violence and coups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.euronews.com/2017/10/08/elections-history-in-africa-s-oldest-democratic-republic-liberia|title=Elections history in Africa's oldest democratic republic: Liberia|date=2017-10-08|work=euronews|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global use of the term ==
Many countries that use the term "democratic republic" in their official names (such as [[Algeria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ag.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Congo-Kinshasa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cg.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethiopia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/et.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[North Korea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/kn.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laos]],&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/la.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Nepal]]&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt;) are considered undemocratic "hybrid regimes" or "authoritarian regimes" by the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://infographics.economist.com/2017/DemocracyIndex/|title=EIU Democracy Index 2016|website=infographics.economist.com|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "not free" by the U.S.-based, U.S.-government-funded [[non-governmental organization]] [[Freedom House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2017?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsPCpyOzu1wIVB41-Ch0XCA7NEAAYASAAEgK35fD_BwE|title=Freedom in the World 2017|website=freedomhouse.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[East Germany]] was also officially known as the German Democratic Republic, but, like the [[Somali Democratic Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.onwar.com/actors/type42/somalidemrep.htm|title=Somali Democratic Republic|website=www.onwar.com|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]], the [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]], the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] and the [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clapham|first=Christopher|date=1987-06-01|title=The constitution of the people's democratic Republic of Ethiopia|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/13523278708414865|journal=Journal of Communist Studies|volume=3|issue=2|pages=192–195|doi=10.1080/13523278708414865|issn=0268-4535}}&lt;/ref&gt; was controlled by a [[Bureaucratic collectivism|bureaucratic government]] espousing [[Marxism–Leninism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/berlin-wall|title=Berlin Wall - Cold War - HISTORY.com|website=HISTORY.com|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also countries which use the term "Democratic Republic" in the name and have a good track of general election and were rated "flawed democracy" or "full democracy" in the Democracy Index, such as the [[Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste]] and the [[Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka]].

The '''European Civil Rights Prize of the [[Sinti]] and [[Romani people|Roma]]''' was founded in November 2007 in [[Heidelberg]] by the [[Central Council of German Sinti and Roma]], the [[Documentation and Cultural Centre of German Sinti and Roma]] and the Manfred Lautenschläger Foundation. The international prize is endowed with 15.000 Euro by the Manfred Lautenschläger Foundation. It has been awarded for the first time in December 2008.

== Intention of the prize==
Against the background of the extremely alarming human rights situation of the Sinti and Roma in many European states – especially in eastern and southeastern Europe – this prize will contribute towards the protection and assertion of the civil rights and the equality of opportunity of the members of the Sinti and Roma minorities in their respective countries of nationality. At the same time, the prize should be regarded as a signal to politicians, media and social groups in Europe to take action against deeply rooted clichés and structures of prejudice, in order to gradually overcome the everyday marginalization of the minority. The European Civil Rights Prize of the Sinti and Roma is aimed at strengthing social engagement and prompting politicians and citizens to actively call for the effective equality of treatment of Sinti and Roma and their self-evident integration into all areas of public life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buergerrechtspreis.de/en/prize.html European Civil Rights Prize]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awarding criteria ==
The prize supports political and social efforts for the lasting protection of people affected by discrimination, in order to enable them to live an independent life. The prize honours individuals, groups or institutions primarily from the majority, who face up to the historical responsibility and have been exemplary in calling for an improvement in the human rights situation of the Sinti and Roma.

== Award procedure ==
The decision is made by an international jury consisting of eight members. Permanent members of the jury are the head of the Central Council of German Sinti and Roma and the head of the Manfred-Lautenschläger-Foundation. They also decide about the other four jury-members, who are appointed for four years. Every jury-member is able to nominate laureates, the election results from majority decision. The repeated awarding of the same individual, group or institution is impossible.

== Members of the jury ==

=== Jury-presidency ===
*[[Romani Rose]] (head of the Central Council and of the Documentation and Cultural Centre of German Sinti and Roma, Heidelberg)
*[[Manfred Lautenschläger]] (head of the Manfred Lautenschläger Foundation, founder of the MLP.AG)

=== Jury-members (2010) ===
*[[Anastasia Crickley]] (Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination)
*[[Maud de Boer-Buquicchio]] (Deputy Secretary General)
*[[Roman Kwiatkowski]] (head of the directorate of the Roma association, Poland)

'''''Hearts of Iron III''''' is a [[grand strategy wargame]] developed by [[Paradox Development Studio]] and published by [[Paradox Interactive]].

It was released on August 7, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamersgate.com/DD-HOI3/hearts-of-iron-3|title=gamer's gate's hearts of iron 3 page|date=August 7, 2009|website=Gamer's gate|accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[OS X]] version was released by [[Virtual Programming]] on December 7, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidemacgames.com/news/story.php?ArticleID=18412|title=Hearts of Iron III Released|date=December 7, 2009|website=[[Inside Mac Games]]|accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sequel, [[Hearts of Iron IV]], was released on June 6, 2016.

== Gameplay ==
''Hearts of Iron III'' allows the player to take control of almost any nation that existed during the period of 1936–1948, guiding it through [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/hearts-of-iron-3/902663p1.html|title=Hearts of Iron III Preview|website=GameSpy|accessdate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a variety of decisions regarding the [[armed forces]], [[Manufacturing|production]], [[research]], [[diplomacy]], [[politics]] and [[espionage]] all being a focus of the game.

The game centers around three factions: the [[Axis powers|Axis]] (led by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]), the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] (led by [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]]), and the [[Comintern]] (led by the [[Soviet Union]]). All other nations can slowly align with one of the factions. Nations are more likely to side with those with similar ideology, threat and proximity.

Resources found in the game include: energy, metal, rare materials and oil. The first three are required for industrial production and oil is converted to fuel for vehicles, planes and ships.

The scope of military organization ranges from [[brigade]]s to entire [[Theater (warfare)|theaters of operation]].

== Development ==
The first trailer from the [[Games Convention]] in Leipzig showed new features such as 3D graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamer.no/videoer/6056|title=First trailer at gamer.no|date=August 21, 2008|website=gamer.no|language=Norwegian, English|accessdate=2008-08-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828032440/http://www.gamer.no/videoer/6056|archivedate=August 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradox released a series of developer diaries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoi3.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=46:developer-diary&amp;Itemid=62&amp;layout=default|title=Developer diaries at hoi3.com|date=30 June 2009|website=hoi3.com|accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and video showcases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbR7o9YmlKM|title=Video showcases on YouTube|date=30 June 2009|website=YouTube|accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although happy with the scope of ''[[Hearts of Iron II]]'', lead designer [[Johan Andersson (game programmer)|Johan Andersson]] wanted to improve upon every aspect of the game, starting again with a new engine.&lt;ref name="RPS interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/05/31/interview-johan-andersson-on-hearts-of-iron-3/|title=RPS interview|accessdate=2009-10-06|website=www.rockpapershotgun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's [[Game artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] (AI) was designed to be able to achieve strategic objectives and control forces delegated to it, including whole [[Theater (warfare)|theatres]] of operation.&lt;ref name="Dev diary 27"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoi3.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=96:dev-diary-27-ai-control&amp;catid=46:developer-diary&amp;Itemid=62|title=Dev diary 27|accessdate=2009-10-06 |website=hoi3.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AI can also remember and compare strategic possibilities as circumstances change.&lt;ref name="Dev diary 27"/&gt; Changing to 3D graphics helped improve other areas, as Andersson explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Going 3D meant we could do another type of architecture where we could support more screen resolutions, and develop our maps in a quicker way. The biggest advantage from going 3D though was the ability to offload more to the [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]. With the machine advances during the last decade this gives us the biggest benefits in development when it comes to gameplay and AI.&lt;ref name="RPS interview"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paradox had a vision for the style of the map, given that the player would spend the majority of their time looking at it: "[...] to create a map that feels like a WW2 map, like it could be a map which... a commander in the War would be looking at himself".&lt;ref name="Dev diary 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoi3.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=59:thursday-16th-october-2008-map-philosophy&amp;catid=46:developer-diary&amp;Itemid=62|title=Dev diary 1|accessdate=2009-05-06|website=HOI3.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content of the map was also altered; the number of provinces was increased to more than 15,000 over ''Hearts of Iron II's'' 2,600.&lt;ref name="Dev diary 1"/&gt; Customizable [[Division (military)|division]]s were also added, each one containing two to five [[brigade]]s. Each brigade increases the division's combat power and cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoi3.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=52:wednesday-26th-november-2008&amp;catid=46:developer-diary&amp;Itemid=62|title=Dev diary 7|accessdate=2009-05-06|website=HOI3.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hearts of Iron III'' initially received a mixed reception because the game shipped with a large number of bugs in the early release.&lt;ref&gt;See official patch notes and change log 1.1-1.3 [http://games.softpedia.com/progChangelog/Hearts-of-Iron-III-Patch-Changelog-46721.html Patch Changelog]&lt;/ref&gt; After several patches eliminated many bugs, reception improved and the game received generally positive reviews. In 2009 December it had a combined average of a 77 on Metacritic"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/heartsofiron3 2009 December score]&lt;/ref&gt; and a 79% on Gamerankings".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/952508-hearts-of-iron-iii/index.html 2009 December score]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gamepro]] wrote, "Perhaps the worst problem is the interface itself, or more specifically, the amount of feedback it affords the player. In contrast to the old system, there is no instant way to assess how many divisions you have in each province, nor important values like their units' organization or combat values".

On the other hand, the game has been praised as being "tailored for experienced strat heads and wargamers with a lot of patience, but the game is more accessible than either of its predecessors and a great jumping-on point for new players who want to make the leap into a grand strategy epic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=August 12, 2009 6:24PM PDT|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/heartsofironiii/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary;read-review|title=Hearts of Iron III Review - GameSpot.com|website=Uk.gamespot.com|date=2009-08-21|accessdate=2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Eritrea}}{{weasel words|date=October 2017}}
'''Human rights in Eritrea''' are viewed by certain [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGOs) such as [[Human Rights Watch]] as among the worst in the world, particularly with regards to [[freedom of the press]].&lt;ref name= "UNHRC"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIEritrea/Pages/ReportCoIEritrea.aspx| title = Report of the commission of inquiry on human rights in Eritrea | work= UNHRC website | date=2015-06-08 |accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hrw2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2010/country-chapters/eritrea|title= Eritrea: Events of 2009| work=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eritrea]] is a [[one-party state]] in which national legislative elections have been repeatedly postponed,&lt;ref name="gi"/&gt; the judiciary is weak, and constitutional provisions protecting individual freedom have yet to be fully implemented.&lt;ref name= "UNHRC" /&gt; Some Western countries, particularly the United States, accuse the [[Government of Eritrea]] of [[arbitrary arrest and detention]]s and of detaining an unknown number of people without charge for their political activism. However, the Eritrean government has continuously dismissed the accusations as politically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HUMAN RIGHTS AND ERITREA’S REALITY|url=http://www.tesfanews.net/wp-content/uploads/Human-Rights-and-Eritreas-Reality.pdf|work=E Smart|publisher=E Smart Campaign|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an attempt at reform, Eritrean government officials and NGO representatives have participated in numerous public meetings and dialogues.&lt;ref name="Pdhrie"/&gt; A new movement called Citizens for Democratic Rights in Eritrea aimed at bringing about dialogue between the government and opposition was also formed in early 2009.&lt;ref name="Egshr"/&gt;

==Overview==
Eritrea is a [[one-party state]] in which national legislative elections have been repeatedly postponed,&lt;ref name="gi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grassrootsonline.org/what-we-do/partnerships/where-we-work/eritrea |title=Eritrea |accessdate=2007-10-25 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724164739/http://www.grassrootsonline.org/what-we-do/partnerships/where-we-work/eritrea |archivedate=24 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}. Grassroots International&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[human rights]] record is considered among the worst in the world.&lt;ref name="hrw2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/eritre12307.htm |title=World Report 2006 |work=Human Rights Watch |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211174118/https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/eritre12307.htm |archivedate=11 February 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US STATE"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2011humanrightsreport/index.htm?dynamic_load_id=186194#wrapper Eritrea]. Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2011. U.S. State Department&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Eritrean–Ethiopian_War|Eritrea's conflict with Ethiopia]] in 1998–2001, Eritrea's human rights record has worsened.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Associated Press|title=Eritrea's human rights record comes under fire at United Nations|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/25/eritrea-human-rights-united-nations|accessdate=30 October 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights violations are frequently committed by the government or on behalf of the government. [[Freedom of speech]], [[News media|press]], [[Freedom of assembly|assembly]], and [[Interpersonal relationship|association]] are limited. Those that practice "unregistered" religions, try to flee the nation, or escape military duty are arrested and put into [[prison]].&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;

According to [[Amnesty International]] Eritrea is one of the world's most repressive countries. In recent years, there have been increasing measures to prevent worshipers from practicing their faith. Some of the most prosecuted are Jehovah's Witness, and members of Evangelical congregations. The Eritrean government has shut down their churches, and persecuted many members of the congregations. After independence, President Issias Afwerki’s administration denied all basic rights to Jehovah's Witnesses. No members could receive any government assistance, or use any government services.  Jehovah's Witnesses are not allowed to obtain national identification cards, without which they are not allowed to participate in the political and social sphere of Eritrea. National identification cards permit citizens to participate in everyday life, as well as in transactions with the government or any financial institution. The government began to informally allow Jehovah's Witness members to practice their faith within their home. They were still barred from practicing in any public space.  Many families fled the country to seek asylum abroad due to mass persecution and imprisonment. According to Amnesty International, there are currently 250 families that have left Eritrea to seek [[Right of asylum|asylum]] abroad.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr64/013/2005/en/]&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic and international human rights organizations are not allowed to function in Eritrea.&lt;ref name="US STATE" /&gt; The registered, census-based religions are the [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] (a [[miaphysite]] [[Oriental Orthodox]] denomination), the [[Roman Catholic Church]], Eritrean [[Lutheran Church]], and [[Sunni]] [[Islam]]. All other religions are persecuted, including other denominations of Islam, such as [[Shi'ism]], and other denominations of Christianity, such as any of the myriad [[Protestant denominations]] (other than the Eritrean Lutheran Church) and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. All denominations of Christianity were given [[freedom of worship]] until 2002 when the government outlawed worship and assembly outside the 'registered' denominations. [[Evangelical]] churches in Eritrea have been some of the most persecuted religious groups. For religious groups to participate and freely practice their faith they must apply for registration with the Department of Religious Affairs. The government has seized many churches and religious buildings.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt;

In 2003, there was a record number of arrests made on members of Evangelical churches. Law enforcements officials go to different religious gatherings or weddings to carry out mass arrests, "Police singled out religious weddings in homes as occasions to round up believers." It is normal for the government to make followers recant their faith, "The detainees were usually pressured under torture or ill-treatment, with the threat of indefinite detention, to sign a document agreeing to certain conditions of release, such as not to attend religious meetings. Some were reportedly forced to recant their faith and agree to rejoin the Orthodox Church." Many of these religious prisoners were often part secret trials, and secret prison sentences.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt; There has been no known reason for the "crackdown" on Evangelical churches, according to Amnesty International, "ongoing crackdown on minority religious groups was never given by the government but it appeared to be partly linked to government action against young people trying to avoid military conscription".&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt; Religious prisoners are often tortured in Eritrea.&lt;ref name="CSW"&gt;[http://www.cswusa.org/news/eritrea CSW-USA on Eritrea] CSW&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of worship is one of the top reasons thousands of Eritreans flee the country.

In 2015, a 500-page [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UNHRC]] report detailed allegations of extrajudicial executions, torture, indefinitely prolonged national service and forced labour, and indicated that sexual harassment, rape and prolonged sexual servitude by state officials are also widespread.&lt;ref name= "UNHRC" /&gt;&lt;ref name= guard&gt;{{cite news|last= Jones | first=Sam| title= Eritrea human rights abuses may be crimes against humanity, says UN |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/08/human-rights-abuses-eritrea-may-be-crimes-against-humanity-un-report| accessdate=2015-06-08 |newspaper=The Guardian|date=2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' cited the reports catalogue of 'a litany of human rights violations "on a scope and scale seldom witnessed elsewhere"'.&lt;ref name= guard /&gt; The Council also asserted that these violations may amount to crimes against humanity.&lt;ref name= "UNHRC" /&gt; Barbara Lochbihler, of the [[European Parliament Subcommittee on Human Rights]] said the report detailed 'very serious human rights violations', and indicated that EU funding for development would not continue as at present without change in Eritrea.&lt;ref name=DWelle&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dw.com/en/human-rights-eu-should-put-more-pressure-on-eritrea/a-18535963 | title = Human rights: EU 'should put more pressure on Eritrea' | work= Deutsche Welle | date=2015-06-23 | accessdate= 2015-07-04 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150704105608/http://www.dw.com/en/human-rights-eu-should-put-more-pressure-on-eritrea/a-18535963 | archivedate= 2015-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eritrean Foreign Ministry responded by describing the Commission's report as "wild allegations" which were "totally unfounded and devoid of all merit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201506100911.html |title=Eritrea: Asmara Lashes Out at UN's 'Vile Slanders' |work=AllAfrica news website |date=10 June 2015 |accessdate=24 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZWBZLNym?url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201506100911.html |archivedate=24 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A statement from Eritrean Presidential Adviser Yemane Gebreab accused the panel of being "entirely one-sided", and indicated that "Eritrea rejects the politically motivated and groundless accusations and the destructive recommendations of the COI. It believes they are an unwarranted attack not only against Eritrea, but also Africa and developing nations."&lt;ref name="i24news.tv"&gt;http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/africa/116057-160608-eritrea-has-been-committing-crimes-against-humanity-for-25-years-un&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission of Inquiry (CoI) report was based on the testimony of 833 anonymous persons purported to be Eritrean. In reaction to this, a significant number of the Eritrean Diaspora population rejected the Commission of Inquiry report. 230,000 Eritreans signed Petitions against the paper and 45,000 Eritreans provided testimonies defending Eritrea, which did not appear in the report. 850 Eritreans asked to present themselves to appear in person in Geneva and give their testimonies to the UNHRC against the paper. In addition, more than 10,000 Eritrean demonstrated against the report in Geneva.&lt;ref name="i24news.tv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tesfanews.net/diaspora-eritreans-rally-against-coi-report-geneva/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/06/22/thousands-eritreans-protest-un-report&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hot91.com.au/news/national-news/54611-thousands-of-eritreans-protest-un-report&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.madote.com/2016/06/video-eritrean-demonstration-in-un.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eastafro.com/2016/06/21/video-thousands-of-eritreans-demonstrate-in-geneva-against-the-un/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20067&amp;LangID=E&lt;/ref&gt; Several countries also rejected the report's abrasive language, especially the US and China. At a drafting meeting, U.S. diplomat Eric Richardson said the Eritrea paper did not have "the same level of sophistication and precision" as the report on North Korea and the United States could not support the language of the text without revisions. In addition, Eritrean Presidential Advisor Yemane blamed Ethiopia for "some of the worst human rights abuses and massacres of its people", saying it was ironic that Ethiopia could use the council to lobby for the adoption of the resolution against Eritrea.&lt;ref&gt;https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKCN0ZH5GW?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reforms==
Eritrean government officials and NGO representatives have participated in numerous public meetings and dialogues. In these sessions they have answered questions as fundamental as, "What are human rights?", "Who determines what are human rights?", and "What should take precedence, human or communal rights?".&lt;ref name="Pdhrie"&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Dialogue Human Rights in Eritrea |url=http://www.shaebia.org/artman/publish/article_4551.html |date=2006-06-01 |accessdate=2006-09-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908190129/http://www.shaebia.org/artman/publish/article_4551.html |archivedate=8 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Eritrean government banned [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref name="Ebfc"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6527619.stm | work=BBC News | title=Eritrea bans female circumcision | date=2007-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regional Assemblies and religious leaders also speak out continuously against the use of female cutting. They cite health concerns and individual freedom as being of primary concern when they say this. Furthermore, they implore rural peoples to cast away this ancient cultural practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anseba Religious leaders condemn female circumcision|url=http://www.shabait.com/staging/publish/article_005411.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015425/http://www.shabait.com/staging/publish/article_005411.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-09-30|date=2006-08-31|accessdate=2006-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious leaders of Northern Red Sea region condemn female circumcision|url=http://www.shabait.com/staging/publish/article_005446.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015303/http://www.shabait.com/staging/publish/article_005446.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-09-30|date=2006-09-09|accessdate=2006-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2009, a new movement called Citizens for Democratic Rights in Eritrea aimed at bringing about dialogue between the government and opposition was formed in early 2009. The group consists of ordinary citizens and some people close to the government. The movement was launched at a two-day conference in [[London]], after previous attempts at dialogue failed.&lt;ref name="Egshr"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7822599.stm | work=BBC News | first=Martin | last=Plaut | title=Eritrea group seeks human rights | date=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Lebanon}}

'''Human rights in Lebanon''' refers to the state of [[human rights]] in [[Lebanon]], which were considered to be on par with global standards in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41726.htm "Lebanon"], ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2004'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 28 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, human rights organizations say that security forces abuse detainees and sometimes use [[torture]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Some criminals and terrorists are said to be detained without charge for both short and long periods of time. [[Freedom of speech]] and of the [[Freedom of press|press]] are ensured to the citizens by the Lebanese laws which protect the freedom of each citizen. [[Palestinians in Lebanon|Palestinians living in Lebanon]] are heavily deprived of basic civil rights. They cannot own homes or land, and are barred from becoming  lawyers, engineers and doctors. However the Lebanese government has reduced the number of restricted jobs recently and created a national dialogue committee for the issue. When the Arab Spring arrived, Lebanon was the only country with no deaths during protests which showed that the country had the most peaceful security forces in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/24/palestinian-refugees-lebanon-rights "Mired in poverty: Palestinian refugees in Lebanon see little hope in new law]", Richard Hall, ''The Guardian'', 24 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]], released a report stating that Lebanon ranked the 2nd in [[Middle East]] and 98th out of 167 countries worldwide for [[Democracy Index]] 2014, the report, which ranks countries according to election processes, pluralism, government functions, political participation, political cultures and fundamental freedoms.

==History==
Lebanon ambassador to the UN, [[Charles Malik]] took part in the drafting of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], which Lebanon adopted in 1948.

==Torture==
There are reports that security forces may abuse detainees and, in some instances, use [[torture]].  The government acknowledged that violent abuse usually occurred during preliminary investigations conducted at police stations or military installations, in which suspects were interrogated without an attorney. Such abuse occurred despite laws that prevented judges from accepting any confession extracted under duress. Methods of torture reportedly included beatings and [[Strappado|suspension by arms tied behind the back]]. Some detainees were beaten, handcuffed, blindfolded, and forced to lie face down on the ground. One person died in custody. Local journalists and human rights organizations were not given access to the [[Yarze prison]], which is controlled by the Ministry of Defense.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41726.htm "Lebanon: Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment"], 2004 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 28 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; A French report describes the methods of torture used in this prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clhrf.com/solida.fhhrl.mersad/solida6.10.06.pdf ''Lebanon: The Ministry of Defense Detention Center: A Major Obstacle to the Prevention of Torture: Forgotten victims, unpunished executioners''], Marie Daunay, Solida (Paris), 5 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Amnesty International|Amnesty international]] annual report 2015- 2016, many Lebanese were subjected to [[torture]] during their detention. In June, five officers were charged with using violence against prisoners at [[Roumieh Prison]] after two videos were posted on social media showing [[Internal Security Forces|Internal Security forces]] officers beating detainees. Amnesty International claimed that [[Lebanon]] failed in establishing a national monitoring body on torture despite the ratification on the optional protocol to the [[United Nations|UN]] Convention against Torture in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/lebanon/report-lebanon/|title=Lebanon 2015/2016|website=www.amnesty.org|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political detention==
The Syrian forces in Lebanon detained political opponents without charge for both short and long periods of time till 2005 . After Syrian forces pulled back from Lebanon during 2005, no opposer to the Syrian Government was reported detained. However, pro-Syrian security generals were detained. For example, Former Major General [[Jamil al Sayyed]], Brigadier General [[Mustafa Hamdan|Mustapha Hamdan]], Major General [[Ali al Hajj|Ali Hajj]], and Brigadier General [[Raymond Azar (security chief)|Raymond Azar]] were arrested in August 2005 at the request of German prosecutor Detlev Mehlis, who headed the early stages of a U.N. investigation into the killing and implicated prominent Syrian and Lebanese figures in the assassination of Rafik Hariri. No charges were ever pressed against the four generals, later progress reports have not repeated the allegations, and the four generals were never brought to trial. Yet, they remained detained for almost four years. Some international human rights organizations had described their detention as arbitrary.&lt;ref name="nar"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE53S4KF20090429 | publisher=Reuters | title=FACTBOX: Lebanese generals ordered released by Hariri court |author=Yara Bayoumy and Tom Perry |date=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 29, 2009, following a request of prosecutor Daniel Bellemare, the tribunal ordered the immediate and unconditional release of the only four suspects arrested during the investigation, for absence of reliable proof against them.&lt;ref name="nar2"&gt;[http://www.stl-tsl.org/en/media/press-releases/order-of-the-pre-trial-judge-regarding-the-release-of-the-four-generals "Order of the Pre-Trial Judge regarding the release of the four Generals"], United Nations Special Tribunal For Lebanon, 29 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations on freedom of speech==
There were big improvements since the withdrawal of 25,000 Syrian troops from Lebanon in April 2005 in what was dubbed the [[Cedar Revolution]] by the West. However, journalists and politicians known to be critical of Syria were targets through car-bomb assassinations prepared by terrorists. [[Waltz With Bashir]], an Israeli film that criticizes aspects of the way the Israeli army handled the [[1982 Lebanon War]] has been banned, although the film is popular among Palestinians living in Lebanon who purchased bootleg copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124113399848475095 | work=Wall Street Journal | first=William | last=Marling | title=Why Jane Fonda Is Banned in Beirut | date=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other movies are banned as well, for example "[[Schindler's List]]" is banned for promoting Zionist sympathy, a position justified by the fact that Lebanon remains officially at war with Israel. Other books and movies were banned for supposedly insulting religion, as the laws strictly prohibit religious insults, and protects each person from such insults, for example "[[The Da Vinci Code]]" and "[[The Satanic Verses]]" but can now be found in major bookstores.

On the morning of 16 September 2015, Lebanese security forces used excessive force in a crackdown on demonstrators protesting rampant corruption and poor public services. The protests took place near the Beirut headquarters of the Lebanese parliament. The Lebanese anti-riot police fired gas tears canisters, rubber-coated steel bullets at protesters, and arrested more than 30 activist, who were all freed in the following days.  During two days, more than 175 protesters were wounded, and several journalists and photographers were assaulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lebanese security forces using  excessive force against protesters|url = http://www.euromedmonitor.org/en/article/914/Lebanese-security-forces-using--excessive-force-against-protesters|website = Euro-Mediterranean|access-date = 2016-02-22|first = Euro-Med|last = Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migrant worker abuse and discrimination==
The abuse of domestic workers in Lebanon, mainly women in their 20-30s from Ethiopia, Sri Lanka and the Philippines has brought international attention to the rights of the workers, who are often made to work long hours,abused and not paid their wages. A spate of suicides by maids over a few weeks before December 2009 by hanging themselves or falling from balconies brought international attention from [[CNN]],&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/12/02/lebanon.suicides/index.html | work=CNN | title=Spate of suicides by foreign maids in Lebanon sheds light on abuse |author=Ollvia Sterns| date=2 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; LA Times and even resulted in the [http://ethiopiansuicides.blogspot.com/ creation of a blog] by a blogger simply identified as "Wissam" to the flagrant abuse in Lebanon.&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com"/&gt;

Migrant workers are widely discriminated against in commercial facilities such as beach resorts, where domestic workers would be denied access to the facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0ZXvVpNxbI&amp;t=3s Flat Out Segregation at Lebanese Beaches], Anti-Racism Movement, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This discrimination is rooted in prejudice, and usually carried out based on racial appearance, therefore it has strong racist undertones.

Following the influx of Syrian refugees, many municipalities have declared "curfews" targeting Syrian nationals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://reliefweb.int/report/lebanon/least-45-local-curfews-imposed-syrian-refugees, At Least 45 Local Curfews Imposed on Syrian Refugees], Human Rights Watch, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Huge banners are prominently hung in public places, declaring a curfew for "Syrian workers". 

==Child labor==
[[Child labor]] is a problem. The minimum age for child employment is 13 years. However, 1.8 percent of children between the ages of 10 and 14 were working children, according to a report on the "State of the Children in Lebanon 2000" released by the Central Statistics Administration in 2002 in collaboration with UNICEF. Also, 90 percent of child laborers were not covered by any health insurance.

According to the [[U.S. Department of Labor]]'s report on the worst forms of child labor in Lebanon in 2013, children "engage in child labor in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/lebanon.htm Lebanon, 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor]&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanese children worked in a variety of sectors and the categorical worst forms of labor included activities such as drug trafficking, armed guarding and forced begging, all of which were determined by national law as hazardous activities. Domestic service and sexual exploitation occurred sometimes as a result of human trafficking.

Later in 2014, the Department's ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'' reported tobacco as a good produced in such working conditions in the Lebanese agricultural sector.

==Discrimination against Palestinians==
Over 400,000 Palestinian refugees and descendants live in Lebanon. They are not allowed to own property, and even need a special permit to leave their refugee camps. Unlike other foreigners in Lebanon, they are denied access to the Lebanese healthcare system. The Lebanese government refused to grant them permission to own land. The number of restrictions has been mounting since 1990.&lt;ref name="s"&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2004/03/2008410145254932243.html "Poverty trap for Palestinian refugees"], Alaa Shahine, Aljazeera, 29 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2010 the government of Lebanon removed work restrictions from Palestinians, enabling them to apply for work permits and work in the private sector.&lt;ref name="t"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11004945 |author=Jim Muir| work=BBC News | title=Lebanon grants Palestinian refugees right to work | date=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 study, [[Amnesty International]] denounced the "appalling social and economic condition" of Palestinians in Lebanon.&lt;ref name="u"&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde18/010/2007/en/ "Exiled and suffering: Palestinian refugees in Lebanon"], Amnesty International, 17 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebanon gave citizenship to about 50,000 Christian Palestinian refugees during the 1950s and 1960s.  In the mid-1990s, about 60,000 refugees who were Sunni Muslim majority were granted citizenship.  This caused a protest from Maronite authorities, leading to citizenship being given to all the Palestinian Christian refugees who were not already citizens.&lt;ref name="v"&gt;Simon Haddad, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1747-7379.2004.tb00206.x/abstract "The Origins of Popular Opposition to Palestinian Resettlement in Lebanon"], ''International Migration Review'', Volume 38 Number 2 (June 2004):470-492.&lt;/ref&gt; There are about 350,000 non-citizen Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.

The Lebanese Parliament is divided on granting Palestinian rights. While many Lebanese parties call for improving the civil rights of Palestinian refugees, others raise concerns of naturalizing the mainly Muslim population and the disruption this might cause to Lebanon’s sectarian balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mroueh|first=Wassim|title=Parliament divided on granting Palestinian rights|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=116032#axzz0r0ZmfbZJ|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=16 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mudar Zahran, a Jordanian scholar of Palestinian heritage, the media chose to deliberately ignore the conditions of the Palestinians living in refugee camps in Lebanon. He writes that the "tendency to blame Israel for everything" has provided Arab leaders an excuse to deliberately ignore the human rights of the Palestinian in their countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=183252 "Demonizing Israel is bad for the Palestinians"], Mudar Zarhan, ''Jerusalem Post'', 8 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Syrian refugee crisis in Lebanon ==
August 2016, [[Human Rights Watch]] issued a report regarding the [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugee crisis]] in [[Lebanon]]. As the report suggested, 1.1 million Syrian refugees- the largest number of refugees per capita in the world- have lived in Lebanon; and around half of these refugees are school-age. Although Lebanon and the international community attempted to help them to enroll in Lebanese public school without paying school fees, only 158,000 non Lebanese students are enrolled in the schools opened for Syrian refugees; and less than 3% of those who are aged 15–18 are enrolled in public secondary schools. Due to the arbitrary enrollment requirement, the harsh residency policy that makes it difficult for refugees to maintain legal status, the transportation costs that the Syrian families cannot afford and the need for additional income that encourages prioritizing child labor over receiving education, a quarter million of the Syrian children are out of school, according to the previous report published in July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/08/16/forgotten-refugees-quarter-million-syrian-children-are-left-without-education|title=The Forgotten Refugees: A Quarter Million Syrian Children Are Left Without an Education|date=2016-08-16|newspaper=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-02-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of religion==
{{main|Freedom of religion in Lebanon}}

The Lebanese [[Constitution of Lebanon|Constitution]] provides for [[freedom of religion]] and the freedom to practice all [[religious rite]]s provided that the [[public order]] is not disturbed. The Constitution declares equality of rights and duties for all citizens without [[discrimination]] or [[preference]] but establishes a balance of power among the major religious groups. The [[Government of Lebanon|Government]] generally respected these rights; however, the constitutional provision for apportioning political offices according to religious affiliation may be viewed as inherently discriminatory. There were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on [[religious belief]] or religious practice. There were, however, periodic reports of tension between religious groups, attributable to competition for political power, and citizens continued to struggle with the legacy of a 15-year [[Lebanese Civil War|civil war]] that was fought largely along sectarian lines. Despite sectarian tensions caused by the competition for political power, [[Church (building)|churches]], [[mosque]]s, and other places of worship continued to exist side-by-side, extending a centuries-long national heritage as a place of refuge for those fleeing religious intolerance. Non-religious Lebanese were subjected to abuse, which is not the case anymore, as their rights are equal to the rights of any other citizen of Lebanon, and that's granted by the country's laws.

==Treatment of homosexuals==
{{main|LGBT rights in Lebanon}}

[[Human sexual activity#Homosexuality|Homosexual intercourse]] is no longer illegal in Lebanon since 2014 as Article 534 of the criminal code was invalidated by the judiciary. This Article used to criminalize both male and female homosexuality, as well as any other sexual practice which is considered deviant and abnormal, but was never truly enforced in recent years. However, gay and lesbian individuals have no specific protections in Lebanon, but there has been several organizations and movements to improve living conditions for the [[LGBT community|gay and lesbian community]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meib.org/articles/0010_ldoc0923.htm "Peaceful Rally in Beirut for Gay Rights"], George Achi, ''L'Orient-Le Jour'', 23 February 2009, English translation by Yoshie Furuhashi, MRZine&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, a [[gay rights]] organization was started in Lebanon. The group, known as [[Hurriyyat Khassa]] or Private Liberties sought to reform the Article 534 of the criminal code so that sexual relations between consenting adults in private were no longer a crime.  Another gay rights organization in Lebanon is called ''[[Helem]]'' ({{Lang-ar| حلم}}), meaning "Dream" in Arabic and an acronym for the Lebanese Protection of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender community.{{clarify|date=November 2015}}  These organizations have staged a few public demonstrations, lectures, fundraisers for AIDS education, charitable events and exhibitions of films and have been interviewed by the Lebanese media.

"Anal examinations" were used in Lebanon on men suspected of homosexuality.  On 28 July 2012, a gay venue in [[Beirut]] was raided by police and 36 men were taken into custody, where they were forced to undergo these examinations.  In response, dozens demonstrated in Beirut against these "examinations," calling them the "tests of shame."&lt;ref name="Anal"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4267954,00.html | title=Lebanese protest anal exams on suspected homosexuals | publisher=Yedioth Ahronot | work=Ynetnews (AFP) | date=13 August 2012 | accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Anal"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19166156 | title=Outraged Lebanese demand end to anal exams on gay men | work=BBC News | date=7 August 2012 | accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was however outlawed by the Ministry of Justice as well as for the Lebanese Doctors' association banning its members from practising it.

==Women's voting rights==
{{Main|Women in Lebanon}}
Women earned the right to vote in 1952, just 5 years later than men, who earned it in 1947 shortly after independence from the [[French Mandate of Syria and the Lebanon|French mandate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://womenshistory.about.com/od/suffrage/a/intl_timeline_2.htm "International Woman Suffrage Timeline: 1952"], Jone Johnson Lewis, About.com, accessed 22 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 the requirement for women to have elementary education before voting was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Elections in Asia and the Pacific: A Data Handbook : Volume I: Middle East, Central Asia, and South Asia|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0191530417|page=174|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BVFBXa69tWMC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=educationa#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet restrictions==
Multiple websites have been reported to be blocked, somewhat inconsistently.&lt;ref&gt;[https://smex.org/mapping-blocked-websites-in-lebanon-2015/ Mapping blocked websites in Lebanon 2015], SMEC news, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Telecommunication is known to have ordered gambling sites and a few pornographic sites to be blocked, based on judiciary decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://advox.globalvoices.org/2014/09/10/lebanon-blocks-six-porn-sites-sparks-fears-of-further-censorship/ Lebanon Blocks Six Porn Sites, Sparks Fears of Further Censorship], Global Voices, September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebanese law permits the censoring of pornography, as well as religious materials only when considered a threat to national security.&lt;ref name=ONICountryProfiles-lebanon&gt;[http://opennet.net/research/profiles/lebanon "ONI Country Profile: Lebanon"], OpenNet Initiative, 6 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2014}} the law doesn't prohibit individuals from accessing pornographical content (save for child porn, considered a criminal act), or any other type of content on the Internet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38525">This is a list of '''[[Italy|Italian]] [[politician]]s belonging to a religious minority''', different from the dominant [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]].

To ensure notability, only leading politicians (ministers, deputies, senators, MEPs, regional councillors, mayors of big cities, party leaders, etc.) are included in the list. Active politicians and their current parties are shown in '''bold'''. The parties of which these people have been members are listed in chronological order.

Some of the politicians included in the list are lapsed, nominal or former believers, but all have retained their ethnic-religious background.

From 1861 to the first decades of the 20th century political parties were mostly loose parliamentary groups. "Right" refers both to the [[Historical Right]] (as linked, referred to also as Liberal Conservatives) of [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Camillo Benso di Cavour]] and [[Bettino Ricasoli]] and the [[Liberal Constitutional Party (Italy)|Liberal Constitutional Party]] of [[Marco Minghetti]] and [[Sidney Sonnino]]. "Left" refers to the [[Historical Left]] (referred to also as Democrats) of [[Agostino Depretis]] and [[Francesco Crispi]]. "Lib" refers to the Liberals, later [[Liberal Union (Italy)|Liberal Union]], which, under the leadership of [[Giovanni Giolitti]] and [[Giuseppe Zanardelli]], emerged from the Historical Left and largely incorporated also elements of the Historical Right.

"Indep" indicates a politician unaffiliated to any party and acting as an Independent.

{{dynamic list}}

The following is a '''list of anarchist musicians''', which details the instruments such musicians use, musical genres they perform, and, if applicable, bands they are members of.

An [[anarchism|anarchist]] is a person who rejects any form of [[hierarchy]] and supports its elimination. Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates self-governed societies with voluntary institutions.
This list only deals with individual, [[self-identification|self-identified]] anarchists who are musicians. Musicians who have not self-identified as anarchists are not included; nor are [[Band (music)|bands]] and [[music collective]]s who collectively identify as anarchist, although individual members thereof may be.

'''Mark Maryboy''' (born December 10, 1955) was an [[United States|American]] [[politician]] for San Juan County, Utah, and a former [[Navajo Nation]] [[Navajo Tribal Council|Council Delegate]] for the Utah Navajo Section of the Navajo Tribe. He is the brother of [[Kenneth Maryboy]] who currently serves in the positions he once stood. Mark is of the [[Navajo people|Navajo Indian Tribe]].

Mark Maryboy was also the [[San Juan County, Utah]] Commissioner for District Three who saw to the needs of the county's residents and the Utah Navajo Element. He made history when he was elected in 1986 as the first Native American county commissioner in [[Utah|Utah's history]].

[[Rebecca M. Benally]] along with the former Navajo Nation Council Delegate Mark Maryboy and protesters from the Aneth Chapter Blocked the main ExxonMobil corporate office for three days in Aneth, Utah.

== Life and education ==
Maryboy was born on December 10, 1955 at St. Christopher's mission near [[Bluff, Utah]]. He was the fifth of eight children, all of whom were raised in a [[Navajo Nation|Navajo hogan]].

Mark attended BIA boarding schools in Kayenta and Aneth at varied times, even though it was hard for him to be separated from his parents during those periods. Government schools were difficult for him as there seemed to be a deliberate attempt to destroy the Indian person that he was. 

Angry and resentful because of harsh treatment, he ran away from boarding school while in third grade. His parents then enrolled him and his beloved brother, Herbert, in the public school at Bluff. They were the first reservation Navajo students to attend public school in San Juan County. 

Upon graduation from San Juan High School in [[Blanding, Utah]] he attended the [[University of Utah]], majoring in history with a minor in business. He garnered a B.A. degree in 1978. 

== Political representative ==

Some time after graduation, he returned to the Navajo Reservation to put his talents to work to help his people. Working as the Director of Education for the Utah Navajo Development Council, he supervised Headstart, Adult Education, and vocational education programs. He created teacher training programs and a special class for teen mothers. 

Not alone in his endeavors, he married the engaging Rosylyn Johnson, who is also a graduate of the University of Utah and a State of Utah Social Worker on the reservation. They have one daughter who currently is attending a higher learning academy.

== San Juan County Commissioner ==
[[Image:Map of Utah highlighting San Juan County.svg|thumb|right|145px|San Juan County which includes the Utah section of the [[Navajo Nation]] near its southern Stateline with [[Arizona]].]]

One hundred and thirty years after Native Americans were pushed to isolated reservations, the Navajo people of Utah reclaimed a place in the American political process. 

In 1986, Maryboy, then age 31 and politically ambitious, ran for San Juan Commissioner. This was the first election after the county was divided by Justice Department decree into commissioner districts. He was elected a San Juan County Commissioner and became the first Native American to hold such a position in the state of Utah. 

An elected official, he realized even greater inequities in services given to his Navajo constituents. The Navajo people were bringing in more money for the county than they were receiving back in services. He mixed it up with the other commissioners, often battling the always capable [[Utah Republican Party|right-wing]] former Commissioner Calvin Black, the undisputed kingpin of San Juan County politics, during hotly contested commission meetings. 

Maryboy's four terms on the San Juan County Commission - particularly the first half-dozen years - were the subject of much press and the stuff of legend-making. His sword-crossing with the late commission chairman, Cal Black, spiked tensions across southern Utah as Maryboy fought for funding for roads, sanitation and water for Utah's Navajos.

In 1989 Navajo elders and other Democratic stalwarts determined to run a Navajo for every county post up for election. 56 percent of San Juan's population was Navajo at the time.  The campaign aimed at getting tribal members to the polls was called "Niha-Whol-Zhiizh", meaning "It's our turn." 

The Democratic-Navajo plan fizzled. Maryboy won a second commission term, but was the only Navajo Indian elected.

== Navajo Nation Council Delegate ==
In November 1990, he was elected to the [[Navajo Nation]] Council as a council delegate from the Aneth area. 

He sat on the Advisory Board of the College of Social &amp; Behavioral Science at the University of Utah. He is currently the chairman of the Navajo Nation Council Budget &amp; Finance Committee. 

Maryboy met President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992 at the Democratic National Convention at Madison Square Garden. Maryboy delivered a prayer in Navajo at one of the sessions. He was a delegate to the [[United Nations]] Conference for Indigenous peoples in [[Geneva, Switzerland]] in July 1992. He was appointed to serve on the Utah Advisory Committee for the United States Commission on Civil Rights in 1993. He was appointed by President Clinton to serve on the [[National Advisory Council on Indian Education]] in 1994.

===Navajo Tribal Council Assault===
In April 2006, [[Navajo Nation Council]] Speaker [[Lawrence T. Morgan]] faced a charge of criminal battery when he struck Council Delegate Mark.

Navajo Council Speaker Morgan struck Maryboy in the chest after Maryboy made a complaint to the speaker that he didn't help Maryboy bring up legislation that had been skipped over earlier that day.

The item—formal condolences to the family of late Council Delegate ''Curley John'' of Aneth, whose family was in the gallery—was skipped because Maryboy was out of the Council Chambers dealing with Constituents.

Maryboy tried later to put the item back on the agenda but was ruled out of order, the paper reported

Aneth Chapter members had demanded Morgan issue a public apology, following the bathroom scuffle, during one of Aneth's monthly chapter meetings in Utah.  Speaker Morgan ignored the Aneth meeting, overall never presenting himself.

== Utah Navajo Commission ==
The Utah Navajo Commission manages revenues derived from mineral development on the Utah portion of the reservation for the Utah Navajos. The population of Utah Dine' is nearing 10,000 enrolled members. Mark Maryboy serves with this entity as well seeing to the deployment of monetary funds and the Navajo energy issues in San Juan County. 

=== Navajo water rights issue ===
In 2002 he and the Utah Navajo Commission urged the [[Navajo Nation]] to reassert [[Colorado River]] water claims the tribe waived in the late 1960s to help facilitate a power plant near [[Page, Arizona]].

In a resolution to the Navajo Nation Council this week, the Utah Navajo also urged the Navajo tribe's water attorney be fired and the tribe create an independent water commission to reform the tribe's water policy

According to the Utah Navajo Commission, the tribe could claim between one and two million acre feet (2.5&amp;nbsp;km³) of Colorado River water, which potentially could be worth billions of dollars.

Mark always felt that it was long past time for the Navajo Nation to take aggressive and comprehensive action on the tribe's dormant water rights.

The council waived at least a portion of its rights in a 1968 agreement with the federal government and the Salt River Project, which planned to build a coal-fired power plant near Page.

In that deal, the council agreed not to demand more than {{convert|50,000|acre.ft|m3}} of Colorado River water so that {{convert|34,100|acre.ft|m3}} could be diverted to the plant.

== Utah Navajo Oil ==
[[Image:Oil well.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Pumpjack]]]]
In 1933, Congress created the Utah Navajo Trust Fund. It is unique in that the state was deemed the trustee-delegate for oil pumped from Navajo land. 

According to the law, 37.5 percent of royalties are supposed to go to Utah Navajos. But a 1991 report from the state found gross mismanagement. Some people were later indicted for misusing the trust fund

Navajos living in nearby San Juan County in southeastern Utah have long protested the saturation of oil and gas wells around their homes. Mark and other Utah Navajos have long argued that the Navajo Nation returns little profit to Navajos living in desperate conditions in the Utah portion of tribal land. 

Utah Navajo allegations of corruption within the U.S. Interior gained support from an Interior whistleblower in 2003.

===Aneth Oil Crisis===
In 1997, local residents began the Aneth Oil Protest against [[Exxon-Mobil]]'s Utah Navajo community policies. Protesters from the Aneth Chapter blocked the main ExxonMobil Corp. Office for 3 days at the '''McElmo Oil Plant''' near Aneth, Utah.

From the start, the protest was made up of local Navajo people who were becoming increasingly angry at Exxon-Mobil's stance towards the environment and its hiring practices within the local communities. Many other national political activist organizations such as the [[American Indian Movement]] wanted to get involved with the protest. However, it was agreed to not include outside affiliates, which might result in losing the original meaning and message of the protest [http://www.hcn.org/servlets/hcn.Article?article_id=3102] .

Former Navajo Nation president [[Albert Hale]] was also mobilized to the northernmost corner of the Navajo Nation where the protest was initiated. Mark, along with members of the Aneth Community, helped create a new standard for the Navajo workers working in the Aneth Oil area as well as the hiring process.

== Life after politics ==
Heeding to his father's wishes, he did not seek a fifth term on the council. 

Maryboy established Utah Navajo Health Systems in 1999 along with Donna Singer. Then he ramrodded tribal legislation that allows the agency to keep its profits, rather than return them to Window Rock. This remains a legacy for the policies Maryboy left.

==Utah Navajo Oil Revenues==
Recently Counsel Delegates Kenneth Maryboy, Davis Filfred, and Former Counsel Delegate Mark Maryboy have been actively working to ensure that the Aneth Oil Royalties stay with the Utah Navajo people.

However such causes are not without competition, the Navajo Nation itself has been working counter to the Utah Navajo people in taking over the Aneth Oil Revenues. It presents a significant problem with a line of issues Kenneth is up against.

On June 16, 2008, Kenneth Maryboy, Mark Maryboy, Davis Filfred, and the honorable Phil Lyman of [[Blanding, Utah]] will travel to [[Washington, D.C.]] to present a working model of how an easy transition from the State of Utah handling Utah Navajo royalty money, to a functioning Utah Navajo organization before Congress.

'''Multicultural transruptions''' are cultural differences that continue to resurface despite multiple efforts of the dominant group to acculturate minority cultures. Their mere presence challenges the [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] practices within mainstream [[national identity]] and creates an alternative [[discourse]] according to Barnor Hesse.&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, Barnor. Un/Settled Multiculturalisms: Diasporas, Entanglements, 'Transruptions' London; New York: Zed, 2000. Print. &lt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110903094203/http://www.afam.northwestern.edu/faculty/hesse.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional notions of the definition of national identity and the cultures that are implied in this definition often deny or fail to incorporate minority cultures and ethnicities. Transruptions challenge the aspects of [[multiculturalism]] that tend to try and merge cultural differences into a single national identity. Transruptions are the result of such practices, which obscure the definition of national identity, bringing to light “the fact that racism [can be] an inherent quality of the national identity”.&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, Barnor. Un/Settled Multiculturalisms: Diasporas, Entanglements, 'Transruptions' London; New York: Zed, 2000. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Transruptions are the response to dominant culture’s view of other cultures as inferior. Transruptions are “troubling and unsettling” to the national identity “because any acknowledgment of their incidence or significance within a discourse threatens the coherence or validity of that discourse”.&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, Barnor. Un/Settled Multiculturalisms: Diasporas, Entanglements, 'Transruptions' London; New York: Zed, 2000. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, national identity may begin to be reexamined with an awareness of the hegemonic practices it contains.

== Multiculturalism Versus Multicultural ==

In order to understand multicultural transruptions, the distinction between multicultural and multicultural''ism'' must be made. Multiculturalism is a political system of discourse characterized by the incorporation of differences and diverse ethnicities into one singular and absolute national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Rahier, Jean Muteba. "Race, Fútbol, and the Ecuadorian Nation: the Ideological Biology of (Non-)Citizenship." Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, 2009,2010. Web. 18 Apr. 2010. &lt;http://hemi.nyu.edu/hemi/en/e-misferica-52/rahier&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been discussed by [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] as a way to “manage diversity".&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Suzanna. "'God's Little Acre' and 'Belfast Chinatown': Cultural Politics and Agencies of Anti-Racist Spatial Inscription." Translocations 1.1 (2006): 56-75.&lt;/ref&gt; However, just as there is no one “correct” form of management, there is no one specific theory or view of multiculturalism. Some different forms of multiculturalism have been described as “conservative,” “liberal,” and “pluralist”.&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, Barnor. Un/Settled Multiculturalisms: Diasporas, Entanglements, 'Transruptions' London; New York: Zed, 2000. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these stems from a distinct political perspective and view of different cultures as having a positive or negative impact on society. Mainstream multiculturalism acknowledges the different cultures present yet attempts to merge them into a singular nationality that does not engage with cultural differences but erases them.&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, Barnor. Un/Settled Multiculturalisms: Diasporas, Entanglements, 'Transruptions' London; New York: Zed, 2000. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The term multicultural on the other hand, refers to the actual cultural differences or “social characteristics of any culturally heterogeneous society”.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Suzanna. "'God's Little Acre' and 'Belfast Chinatown': Cultural Politics and Agencies of Anti-Racist Spatial Inscription." Translocations 1.1 (2006): 56-75. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Because multicultural refers to cultural differences, it automatically becomes associated with multiculturalism. The presence of cultural differences challenges multiculturalism’s attempts at managing diversity. Thus, in this sense, one can understand multicultural transruptions as challenges to multiculturalism’ s single national form through multicultural discrepancies.

== Examples ==
=== Ecuador ===

Jean Muteba Rahier argues that the performance of the [[Ecuadorian national football team]], which was made up of mostly Afro-Ecuadorian players, at the 2006 FIFA world cup was transruptive to the national race discourse. Ecuador’s popular national mestizaje identity, a form of multiculturalism that seeks to incorporate all races into one national identity, was challenged by the obvious presence of these black players as they became prominent representational figures of the nation through their athletic success. Afro-Ecuadorians, usually a marginalized and sometimes invisible component of Ecuadorian identity, were suddenly at the forefront of national consciousness.

[[File:Chinese Welfare Association (CWA) Building in Belfast.jpg|thumb|The Chinese Welfare Association, Belfast]]

As discussed in Suzanna Chan’s article, the Belfast-based Chinese Welfare Association decided to create two specific spaces for the Chinese diaspora. One was housing for the Chinese elderly and the other was a community and resource centre. The centre’s proposed location in the Protestant majority area of Donegall Pass was contested by many who felt that the centre would create more segregation within the community and hurt the local community centre’s use, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Suzanna. "'God's Little Acre' and 'Belfast Chinatown': Cultural Politics and Agencies of Anti-Racist Spatial Inscription." Translocations 1.1 (2006): 56-75. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; One grave concern was that it would further shift the local identity from a Protestant ‘God’s little acre’ to ‘Belfast Chinatown’.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Suzanna. "'God's Little Acre' and 'Belfast Chinatown': Cultural Politics and Agencies of Anti-Racist Spatial Inscription." Translocations 1.1 (2006): 56-75. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the centre was eventually built in a different location, the discourse created through the proposal presented a multicultural transruption since it constituted a pursuit for an ‘ethnic space,’ challenging the Anglo concept of “neutral space”.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Suzanna. "'God's Little Acre' and 'Belfast Chinatown': Cultural Politics and Agencies of Anti-Racist Spatial Inscription." Translocations 1.1 (2006): 56-75. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The project transrupted the hegemonic concepts of local Protestant identity as well as national Protestant and Catholic identity by bringing to the forefront Chinese claims for a legitimate and socially acknowledged cultural space.

'''National security''' refers to the [[security]] of a [[nation state]], including its [[Citizenship|citizens]], [[economy]], and institutions, and is regarded as a duty of government.

Originally conceived as protection against [[Offensive (military)|military attack]], national security is now widely understood to include non-military dimensions, including [[economic security]], [[energy security]], [[environmental security]], [[food security]], [[Computer security|cyber security]] etc. Similarly, national security risks include, in addition to the actions of other [[nation state]]s, action by [[violent non-state actor]]s, [[narcotic cartel]]s, and [[multinational corporation]]s, and also the effects of [[natural disaster]]s.

Governments rely on a range of measures, including [[political power|political]], [[Economic power|economic]], and [[military]] power, as well as [[diplomacy]] to enforce national security. They may also act to build the conditions of security regionally and internationally by reducing [[transnationality|transnational]] causes of insecurity, such as [[global warming|climate change]], [[economic inequality]], [[Social exclusion|political exclusion]], and [[nuclear proliferation]].

== Definitions ==
The concept of national security remains ambiguous, having evolved from simpler definitions which emphasised freedom from military threat and from political coercion.&lt;ref name="Romm 1993"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Defining national security: the nonmilitary aspects |last=Romm |first=Joseph J.|authorlink=Joseph J. Romm |coauthors= |year=1993 |publisher=Council on Foreign Relations |location= |series=Pew Project on America's Task in a Changed World (Pew Project Series) |isbn=978-0-87609-135-7 |pages=122 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=shxDOnuVcyYC |accessdate=22 September 2010 &lt;!-- (full view) --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–6}}&lt;ref name="Paleri"&gt;{{cite book |title=National Security: Imperatives And Challenges |last=Paleri |first=Prabhakaran |authorlink=Prabhakaran Paleri |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill |location=New Delhi |isbn=978-0-07-065686-4 |pages=521 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DMzcGe0-HQwC |accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52–54}} Among the many definitions proposed to date are the following, which show how the concept has evolved to encompass non-military concerns:
* "A nation has security when it does not have to sacrifice its legitimate ínterests to avoid war, and is able, if challenged, to maintain them by war." ([[Walter Lippmann]], 1943).&lt;ref name="Romm 1993" /&gt;{{rp|5}}
* "The distinctive meaning of national security means freedom from foreign dictation." ([[Harold Lasswell]], 1950)&lt;ref name="Romm 1993" /&gt;{{rp|79}}
* "National security objectively means the absence of threats to acquired values and subjectively, the absence of fear that such values will be attacked." (Arnold Wolfers, 1960)&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Quoted in Paleri (2008) ibid. Pg 52.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "National security then is the ability to preserve the nation's physical integrity and territory; to maintain its economic relations with the rest of the world on reasonable terms; to preserve its nature, institution, and governance from disruption from outside; and to control its borders." ([[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]], [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]], 1977-1981)&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Brown, Harold (1983) ''Thinking about national security: defense and foreign policy in a dangerous world''. As quoted in {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnlIR4YO2vsC|title=U.S. national security: a reference handbook|last=Watson|first=Cynthia Ann|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2008|isbn=978-1-59884-041-4|edition=2 (revised)|series=Contemporary world issues|location=|pages=281|authorlink=|accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "National security... is best described as a capacity to control those domestic and foreign conditions that the public opinion of a given community believes necessary to enjoy its own self-determination or autonomy, prosperity and wellbeing." ([[Charles S. Maier|Charles Maier]], 1990)&lt;ref name="MacArthur Fellowship Program 1990. p.5"&gt;{{Smallcaps|Maier, Charles S.}} ''Peace and security for the 1990s''. Unpublished paper for the MacArthur Fellowship Program, Social Science Research Council, 12 Jun 1990. As quoted in Romm 1993, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;
* "National security is an appropriate and aggressive blend of political resilience and maturity, human resources, economic structure and capacity, technological competence, industrial base and availability of natural resources and finally the military might." ([[National Defence College, India|National Defence College of India]], 1996)&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Definition from "Proceedings of Seminar on "A Maritime Strategy for India" (1996). National Defence College, [[Tees January Marg]], New Delhi, India. quoted in Paleri 2008 (ibid).&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[National security is the] measurable state of the capability of a nation to overcome the multi-dimensional threats to the apparent well-being of its people and its survival as a nation-state at any given time, by balancing all instruments of state policy through governance... and is extendable to global security by variables external to it." ([[Prabhakaran Paleri]], 2008)&lt;ref name="Paleri" /&gt;{{rp|52–54}}
* "[National and international security] may be understood as a shared freedom from fear and want, and the freedom to live in dignity. It implies social and ecological health rather than the absence of risk... [and is] a common right." (Ammerdown Group, 2016)&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rethinkingsecurityorguk.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/rethinking-security-a-discussion-paper.pdf|title=Rethinking Security: A discussion paper|last=Ammerdown Group|first=|date=2016|website=rethinkingsecurity.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

== Dimensions of national security ==
Potential causes of national insecurity include actions by other states (e.g. [[Military aggression|military]] or [[Cyberattack|cyber attack]]), [[violent non-state actor]]s (e.g. [[Terrorism|terrorist attack]]), [[Organized crime|organised criminal groups]] such as [[narcotic cartel]]s, and also the effects of [[natural disaster]]s (e.g. flooding, earthquakes).{{nowrap|&lt;ref name="Romm 1993"/&gt;{{rp|v, 1–8}}}}&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/658007519|title=Losing control : global security in the twenty-first century|last=Rogers|first=P|date=2010|publisher=Pluto Press|year=|isbn=9780745329376|edition=3rd|location=London|pages=|oclc=658007519}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systemic drivers of insecurity, which may be [[transnationality|transnational]], include [[global warming|climate change]], [[economic inequality]] and [[marginalisation]], [[Social exclusion|political exclusion]], and [[Militarization|militarisation]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In view of the wide range of risks, the security of a nation state has several dimensions, including [[economic security]], [[energy security]], [[Military security|physical security]], [[environmental security]], [[food security]], [[border guard|border security]], and [[Computer security|cyber security]]. These dimensions correlate closely with [[elements of national power]].

Increasingly, governments organise their [[security policies]] into a national security strategy (NSS); as of 2017, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States are among the states to have done so.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/documents/estrategiaseguridad_baja_julio.pdf|title=The National Security Strategy: Sharing a common project|last=Spanish Government|first=|date=2013|website=|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-security-strategy-and-strategic-defence-and-security-review-2015|title=National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015|last=UK, Cabinet Office|first=|date=2015|website=|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nssarchive.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015.pdf|title=National Security Strategy|last=US, White House|first=|date=2015|website=|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states also appoint a National Security Council to oversee the strategy and/or a National Security Advisor.

Although states differ in their approach, with some beginning to prioritise non-military action to tackle systemic drivers of insecurity, various forms of coercive power predominate, particularly [[Military Capabilities|military capabilities]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The scope of these capabilities has developed. Traditionally, military capabilities were mainly land- or sea-based, and in smaller countries they still are. Elsewhere, the domains of potential warfare now include the [[Air force|air]], [[Space warfare|space]], [[Cyberwarfare|cyberspace]], and [[Psychological warfare|psychological operations]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16478792|title=War in the fifth domain|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military capabilities designed for these domains may be used for national security, or equally for offensive purposes, for example to conquer and annex territory and resources.

=== Physical security ===
{{main|Military security}}In practice, national security is associated primarily with managing physical threats and with the [[military]] capabilities used for doing so.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; That is, national security is often understood as the capacity of a nation to mobilise military forces to guarantee its borders and to deter or successfully defend against physical threats including [[Offensive (military)|military aggression]] and attacks by [[Violent non-state actor|non-state actors]], such as [[terrorism]]. Most states, such as South Africa and Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dod.mil.za/documents/defencereview/defence%20review%202015.pdf|title=South African Defence Review, 2015|last=South Africa, Department of Defence|first=|date=2015|website=|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.government.se/4aa5de/contentassets/0e04164d7eed462aa511ab03c890372e/national-security-strategy.pdf|title=National Security Strategy|last=Sweden, Prime Minister's Office|first=|date=2017|website=|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; configure their military forces mainly for territorial defence; others, such as France, Russia, the UK and the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defense.gouv.fr/english/content/download/514659/8664385/Strategic%20review%20of%20defense%20and%20national%20security%202017%20%E2%80%93%20Key%20points.pdf|title=Strategic Review of Defence and National Security|last=France|first=|date=2017|website=|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csis.org/analysis/unpacking-russias-new-national-security-strategy|title=Unpacking Russia's New National Security Strategy|last=Olika|first=O|date=2016|website=www.csis.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; invest in higher-cost [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary capabilities]], which allow their armed forces to [[Power projection|project power]] and sustain [[military operation]]s abroad.{{See also|Terrorism|Border guard|Military aggression}}

=== Political security ===
[[Barry Buzan]], [[Ole Wæver]], [[Jaap de Wilde]] and others have argued that national security depends on [[political security]]: the stability of the social order.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite book |title=Security: a new framework for analysis |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |last3= |first3= |authorlink= |vauthors= |year=1998 |publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers |location= |isbn=978-1-55587-784-2 |pages=239 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Paul Rogers, have added that the equitability of the international order is equally vital.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hence, political security depends on the rule of [[international law]] (including the [[Law of war|laws of war]]), the effectiveness of [[International institutions|international political institutions]], as well as [[diplomacy]] and [[negotiation]] between nations and other security actors.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It also depends on, among other factors, effective political inclusion of disaffected groups and the [[human security]] of the citizenry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/humansecurity/|title=UN Trust Fund for Human Security|last=United Nations|first=|date=|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic security ===
{{Main|Economic security}}
Economic security, in the context of [[international relations]], is the ability of a [[Nation-state|nation state]] to maintain and develop the national economy, without which other dimensions of national security cannot be managed. In larger countries, strategies for economic security expect to access resources and markets in other countries, and to protect their own markets at home. [[Developing country|Developing countries]] may be less secure than economically advanced states due to high rates of unemployment and underpaid work.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== Ecological security ===
{{main|Environmental security}}Ecological security, also known as environmental security, refers to the integrity of [[ecosystem]]s and the [[biosphere]], particularly in relation to their capacity to sustain a [[Biodiversity|diversity of life-forms]] (including human life). The security of ecosystems has attracted greater attention as the impact of ecological damage by humans has grown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/65/161|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 20 December 2010|last=United Nations General Assembly|first=|date=2010|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degradation of ecosystems, including [[Soil erosion|topsoil erosion]], [[deforestation]], [[biodiversity loss]], and [[climate change]], affect economic security and can precipitate [[mass migration]], leading to increased pressure on resources elsewhere.

The scope and nature of environmental threats to national security and strategies to engage them are a subject of debate.&lt;ref name="Romm 1993" /&gt;{{rp|29–33}} Romm (1993) classifies the major impacts of ecological changes on national security as:&lt;ref name="Romm 1993" /&gt;{{rp|15}}
* ''Transnational environmental problems.'' These include global environmental problems such as [[climate change]] due to [[global warming]], [[deforestation]], and [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="Romm 1993" /&gt;{{rp|15}}
* ''Local environmental or resource pressures''. These include resource scarcities leading to local conflict, such as disputes over [[water scarcity]] in the [[Middle East]]; migration into the United States caused by the failure of agriculture in [[Mexico]];&lt;ref name="Romm 1993" /&gt;{{rp|15}} and the impact on the conflict in Syria of erosion of productive land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gleick|first=Peter H.|date=2014-03-03|title=Water, Drought, Climate Change, and Conflict in Syria|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/WCAS-D-13-00059.1|journal=Weather, Climate, and Society|volume=6|issue=3|pages=331–340|doi=10.1175/wcas-d-13-00059.1|issn=1948-8327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental insecurity in [[Rwanda]] following a rise in population and dwindling availability of farmland, may also have contributed to the genocide there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ditext.com/diamond/10.html |title=Malthus in Africa: Rwanda's Genocide |author=Diamond, Jared |authorlink=Jared Diamond|date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=26 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Environmentally threatening outcomes of warfare.'' These include acts of war that degrade or destroy ecosystems. Examples are the [[Roman empire|Roman]] destruction of agriculture in [[Carthage]]; Saddam Hussein's burning of oil wells in the [[Gulf War]];&lt;ref name="Romm 1993" /&gt;{{rp|15–16}} the use of [[Agent Orange]] by the UK in the [[Malayan Emergency]] and the USA in the [[Vietnam War]] for [[Defoliant|defoliating]] forests; and the high [[greenhouse gas]] emissions of [[Military|military forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://energy.defense.gov/Portals/25/Documents/Reports/20131015_FY12_OE_Annual_Report.pdf|title=Fiscal year 2012: Operational energy annual report|last=US, Department of Defense|first=|date=2013|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140919020416/http://energy.defense.gov/Portals/25/Documents/Reports/20131015_FY12_OE_Annual_Report.pdf|archive-date=2014-09-19|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security of energy and natural resources ===
{{Main|Energy security}}
Resources include water, sources of energy, land and minerals. Availability of adequate natural resources is important for a nation to develop its industry and economic power. For example, in the [[Persian Gulf War]] of 1991, [[Iraq]] captured [[Kuwait]] partly in order to secure access to its oil wells, and one reason for the US counter-invasion was the value of the same wells to its own economy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Water resources are subject to disputes between many nations, including [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], and in the [[Middle East]].

The interrelations between security, energy, natural resources, and their sustainability is increasingly acknowledged in national security strategies and resource security is now included among the [[Sustainable Development Goals|UN Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|date=2015|title=Sustainable Energy Investments and National Security: Arbitration and Negotiation Issues|journal=Journal of World Energy Law and Business|volume=8|issue=6|ssrn=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, for example, the military has installed [[solar photovoltaic]] [[microgrids]] on their bases in case of [[power outage]].&lt;ref&gt;Prehoda, et al. 2017.

''Renewable &amp; Sustainable Energy Reviews'' '''78''', 167–175.

=== Computer security ===
{{main|Computer security}}
[[Computer security]], also known as cybersecurity or IT security, refers to the security of computing devices such as [[computer]]s and smartphones, as well as [[computer network]]s such as private and public networks, and the [[Internet access|Internet]]. It concerns the protection of hardware, software, data, people, and also the procedures by which systems are accessed, and the field has growing importance due to the increasing reliance on computer systems in most societies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/technology/opinion/reliance-spells-end-of-road-for-ict-amateurs/story-e6frgb0o-1226636267865?nk=34fe4ab684629535daaf6a8fe6e6ef3d "Reliance spells end of road for ICT amateurs"], May 07, 2013, The Australian&lt;/ref&gt; Since unauthorized access to critical civil and military infrastructure is now considered a major threat, cyberspace is now recognised as a domain of warfare.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Infrastructure security ===

Infrastructure security is the [[security]] provided to protect [[infrastructure]], especially [[critical infrastructure]], such as [[airport]]s, [[highway]]s &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/highway/index.shtm&lt;/ref&gt; [[rail transport]], [[hospital]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[transport hub]]s, network communications, [[Media (communication)|media]], the [[Grid (electricity)|electricity grid]], [[dam]]s, [[power plant]]s, [[seaport]]s, [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]], and [[water system]]s. Infrastructure security seeks to limit vulnerability of these structures and systems to [[sabotage]], [[terrorism]], and [[contamination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsa.gov/who_we_are/index.shtm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216161520/http://www.tsa.gov/who_we_are/index.shtm |archivedate=2008-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries have established government agencies to directly manage the security of critical infrastructure usually through the Ministry of Interior/Home Affairs, dedicated security agencies to protect facilities such as United States [[Federal Protective Service (United States)|Federal Protective Service]], and also dedicated transport police such as the [[British Transport Police]]. There are also commercial transportation security units such as the [[Amtrak Police]] in the United States. Critical infrastructure is vital for the essential functioning of a country. Incidental or deliberate damage can have a serious impact on the economy and essential services. Some of the threats to infrastructure include:

* [[Terrorism]]: person or groups deliberately targeting critical infrastructure for political gain. In the [[November 2008 Mumbai attacks]], the Mumbai central station and hospital were deliberately targeted, for example.
* [[Sabotage]]: person or groups such as ex-employees, anti-government groups, environmental groups. Refer to [[People's Alliance for Democracy#Seizure of Suvarnabhumi International Airport|Bangkok's International Airport Seized by Protestors]].
* [[Information warfare]]: private person hacking for private gain or countries initiating attacks to glean information and damage a country's cyber infrastructure. [[2007 cyberattacks on Estonia|Cyberattacks on Estonia]] and [[cyberattacks during the 2008 South Ossetia war]] are examples.
* [[Natural disaster]]: hurricane or other natural events which damage critical infrastructure such as oil pipelines, water and power grids. See [[Hurricane Ike#Oil and gas spills|Hurricane Ike]] and [[Economic effects of Hurricane Katrina]] for examples.

== Issues in national security ==

=== Consistency of approach ===
The dimensions of national security outlined above are frequently in tension with one another. For example:
* The high cost of maintaining large [[Military|military forces]] places a burden on the economic security of a nation. The share of government expenditure on state armed forces varies internationally; for example, in 2015 it was 4% in Germany, 9% in Chile, 14% in the USA, 15% in Israel, and 19% in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.ZS|title=Military expenditure (% of central government expenditure, 2015)|last=World Bank|first=|date=2017|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, economic constraints can limit the scale of expenditure on [[Military|military capabilities]].
* Unilateral security action by states can undermine political security at an international level if it erodes the [[rule of law]] and undermines the authority of [[International organization|international institutions]]. The [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] in 2003 and the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]] in 2014 have been cited as examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/880550682|title=Wars in peace : British military operations since 1991|others=Johnson, Adrian (Historian),, Chalmers, Malcolm, 1956-, Clarke, Michael, 1950-, Codner, Michael,, Fry, Robert (Robert Alan), 1951-, Omand, David,|isbn=9780855161934|location=London, UK|oclc=880550682}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47443&amp;Cr=ukraine&amp;Cr1=#.WjekA99l_IV|title=UN News - Backing Ukraine’s territorial integrity, UN Assembly declares Crimea referendum invalid|last=Section|first=United Nations News Service|date=2014-03-27|website=UN News Service Section|language=en|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The pursuit of economic security in competition with other nation states can undermine the ecological security of all when the impact includes widespread [[Soil erosion|topsoil erosion]], [[biodiversity loss]], and [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/320800523|title=Prosperity without growth: economics for a finite planet|last=Jackson|first=T|date=2009|publisher=Earthscan|year=|isbn=9781849713238|location=London|pages=|oclc=320800523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, expenditure on mitigating or adapting to ecological change places a burden on the national economy.
If tensions such as these are not managed effectively, national security policies and actions may be ineffective or counterproductive.

=== National versus transnational security ===
Increasingly, national security strategies have begun to recognise that nations cannot provide for their own security without also developing the security of their regional and international context.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-national-security-strategy-of-the-united-kingdom-security-in-an-interdependent-world|title=The national security strategy of the United Kingdom: security in an interdependent world|last=UK, Cabinet Office|first=|date=2008|website=|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For example, Sweden's national security strategy of 2017 declared:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Wider security measures must also now encompass protection against epidemics and infectious diseases, combating terrorism and organised crime, ensuring safe transport and reliable food supplies, protecting against energy supply interruptions, countering devastating climate change, initiatives for peace and global development, and much more."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:F-14A VF-114 over burning Kuwaiti oil well 1991.JPEG|thumb|A US [[Fighter aircraft|fighter jet]] over a burning [[oil well]] in [[Kuwait]] during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], 1991]]
The extent to which this matters, and how it should be done, is the subject of debate. Some argue that the principal beneficiary of national security policy should be the nation state itself, which should centre its strategy on protective and coercive capabilities in order to safeguard itself in a hostile environment (and potentially to project that power into its environment, and dominate it to the point of [[Full-spectrum dominance|strategic supremacy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=45289|title=Joint Vision 2020 Emphasizes Full-spectrum Dominance|last=US, Department of Defense|first=|date=2000|website=archive.defense.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmdfence/512/51202.htm|title=Re-thinking defence to meet new threats|last=House of Commons Defence Committee|first=|date=2015|website=publications.parliament.uk|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/building-a-british-military-fit-for-future-challenges-rather-than-past-conflicts|title=Building a British military fit for future challenges rather than past conflicts|last=General Sir Nicholas Houghton|first=|date=2015|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that security depends principally on building the conditions in which equitable relationships between nations can develop, partly by reducing antagonism between actors, ensuring that fundamental needs can be met, and also that differences of interest can be negotiated effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fcnl.org/updates/peace-through-shared-security-79|title=Peace Through Shared Security|last=FCNL|first=|date=2015|work=|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; In the UK, for example, Malcolm Chalmers argued in 2015 that the heart of the UK's approach should be support for the Western strategic military alliance led through [[NATO]] by the United States, as "the key anchor around which international order is maintained".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rusi.org/publication/briefing-papers/force-order-strategic-underpinnings-next-nss-and-sdsr|title=A Force for Order: Strategic Underpinnings of the Next NSS and SDSR|last=Chalmers|first=M|date=2015-05-05|work=RUSI|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ammerdown Group argued in 2016 that the UK should shift its primary focus to building international cooperation to tackle the systemic drivers of insecurity, including [[climate change]], [[economic inequality]], [[Militarization|militarisation]] and the political exclusion of the world's poorest people.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Impact on civil liberties and human rights ===
Approaches to national security can have a complex impact on [[human rights]] and [[civil liberties]]. For example, the rights and liberties of citizens are affected by the use of [[military personnel]] and [[Militarization of police|militarised police forces]] to control public behaviour; the use of [[surveillance]] including [[mass surveillance]] in [[cyberspace]]; [[military recruitment]] and [[conscription]] practices; and the effects of [[warfare]] on [[civilian]]s and [[civil infrastructure]]. This has led to a [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectical]] struggle, particularly in [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]], between government [[authority]] and the rights and freedoms of the general public.
[[File:National Security Agency, 2013.jpg|thumb|The [[National Security Agency]] harvests personal data across the internet.]]
Even where the exercise of national security is subject to [[good governance]] and the [[rule of law]], a risk remains that the term ''national security'' may be become a [[pretext]] for suppressing [[political dissent|unfavorable political and social views]]. In the US, for example, the controversial [[USA Patriot Act]] of 2001, and the revelation by [[Edward Snowden]] in 2013 that the [[National Security Agency]] [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|harvests the personal data of the general public]], brought these issues to wide public attention. Among the questions raised are whether and how national security considerations at times of war should lead to the suppression of individual rights and freedoms, and whether such restrictions are necessary when a state is not at war.

== Country-by-country perspectives ==
{{expand section||date=December 2017|small=No}}

=== Brazil ===
National Security ideology as taught by the [[US Army School of the Americas]] to military personnel were vital in causing the military coup of 1964. The military dictatorship was installed on the claim by military that Leftists were an existential threat to the national interests.&lt;ref&gt;Emir Sader, "The coup in Brazil and the doctrine of National Security" (Portuguese) http://cartamaior.com.br/?/Blog/Blog-do-Emir/O-golpe-no-Brasil-e-a-doutrina-de-seguranca-nacional/2/27107&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
{{main|National security of China}}
China's Armed Forces are known as the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA). The military is sizeable with 2.3 million active troops in 2005.

The [[Ministry of State Security (China)|Ministry of State Security]] was established in 1983 to ensure “the security of the state through effective measures against enemy agents, spies, and counterrevolutionary activities designed to sabotage or overthrow China’s socialist system.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/world/china/mss/index.html Ministry of State Security], Intelligence Resource Program, [[Federation of American Scientists]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim separatists in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are China's most significant domestic threat.

=== Russia ===
In the years 1997 and 2000, Russia adopted documents titled "National Security Concept" that described Russia's global position, the country's interests, listed threats to national security and described the means to counter those threats. In 2009, these documents were superseded by the "''National Security Strategy to 2020''". The key body responsible for coordination of policies related to Russia's national security is the [[Security Council of Russia]].

According to provision 6 of the ''National Security Strategy to 2020'', national security is "the situation in which the individual, the society and the state enjoy protection from foreign and domestic threats to the degree that ensures constitutional rights and freedoms, decent quality of life for citizens, as well as sovereignty, territorial integrity and stable development of the Russian Federation, the defense and security of the state."

=== Europe ===

==== United Kingdom ====
The primary body responsible for coordinating national security policy in the UK is the [[National Security Council (United Kingdom)]]. It was created in May 2010 by the new [[coalition government]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)]] and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. The National Security Council is a committee of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]] and was created as part of a wider reform of the national [[security apparatus]]. This reform also included the creation of a [[National Security Adviser (United Kingdom)]] and a [[National Security Secretariat]] to support the National Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/national-security-council |title=The National Security Council: national security at the centre of government |author=Dr Joe Devanny &amp; Josh Harris |publisher=Institute for Government &amp; King's College London |accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== National Security Act of 1947 ====
{{Main|National Security Act of 1947|United States National Security Council}}
The concept of national security became an official guiding principle of [[Foreign relations of the United States|foreign policy in the United States]] when the [[National Security Act of 1947]] was signed on July 26, 1947 by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Harry S. Truman]].&lt;ref name="Romm 1993" /&gt;{{rp|3}} As amended in 1949, this Act:
:* created important components of American national security, such as the precursor to the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]);
:* subordinated the military branches to the new cabinet-level position of [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]];
:* established the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]];&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite book |title=U.S. Foreign Policy and National Security: Chronology and Index for the 20th Century |last=Davis |first=Robert T. |authorlink= |series=Praeger Security International Series |editor=Robert T. Davis |edition=Illustrated |year=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location= |isbn=978-0-313-38385-4 |pages=xiii–xiv |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gsM1JiXAMJEC |accessdate=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, the Act did ''not'' define national security, which was conceivably advantageous, as its ambiguity made it a powerful phrase to invoke whenever issues threatened by other interests of the state, such as domestic concerns, came up for discussion and decision.&lt;ref name="Romm 1993" /&gt;{{rp|3–5}}

The notion that national security encompasses more than just military security was present, though understated, from the beginning. The Act established the National Security Council so as to "advise the President on the integration of domestic, military and foreign policies relating to national security".&lt;ref name="Paleri" /&gt;{{rp|52}}

While not defining the "interests" of national security, the Act does establish, within the National Security Council, the "Committee on Foreign Intelligence", whose duty is to conduct an annual review "identifying the intelligence required to address the national security interests of the United States ''as specified by the President''" (emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|50|402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gen. [[Maxwell Taylor]]'s 1974 essay "The Legitimate Claims of National Security", Taylor states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=Gen Maxwell |authorlink=Maxwell Taylor |first2= |year=1974 |title=The Legitimate Claims of National Security |journal=[[Foreign Affairs]] |publisher=Council on Foreign Relations, Inc. |volume= 52|issue=Essay of 1974 |pages= 577|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/24508/maxwell-d-taylor/the-legitimate-claims-of-national-security |doi= 10.2307/20038070|accessdate= 25 September 2010|jstor=20038070 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The national valuables in this broad sense include current assets and national interests, as well as the sources of strength upon which our future as a nation depends. Some valuables are tangible and earthy; others are spiritual or intellectual. They range widely from political assets such as the Bill of Rights, our political institutions and international friendships, to many economic assets which radiate worldwide from a highly productive domestic economy supported by rich natural resources. It is the urgent need to protect valuables such as these which legitimizes and makes essential the role of national security.}}
&lt;!--During the [[Cold War]]'s [[Polarity in international relations#Bipolarity|bipolar system]], states were relying on the two [[superpower]]s to guarantee their national security. But any system is not everlasting. Communism collapsed and sovereign states emerged without a guarantor. States had to build a nation, maintain national security and rely on themselves. Following the [[terrorism|terrorist]] [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the United States, and subsequent terrorist incidents around the world, national security has become a paramount concern for governments and societies.--&gt;

==== Obama administration ====
The [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Armed Forces]] defines national security of the United States in the following manner :&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=JP 1 (02) "Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms", 2001 (As amended through 31 July 2010) |author=US NATO Military Terminology Group |year=2010 |publisher=Joint Chiefs of Staff, US Department of Defense |location=Pentagon, Washington |isbn= |page=361 |url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf|accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, the condition provided by: a. a military or defense advantage over any foreign nation or group of nations; b. a favorable foreign relations position; or c. a defense posture capable of successfully resisting hostile or destructive action from within or without, overt or covert.}}

In 2010, the [[White House]] included an all-encompassing world-view in a national security strategy which identified "security" as one of the country's "four enduring national interests" that were "inexorably intertwined":&lt;ref&gt;{{Smallcaps|Obama, Barack}}. ''[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf National Security Strategy, May 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422092149/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf |date=2011-04-22 }}''.

* ''Values:'' Respect for universal values at home and around the world.
* ''International Order:''&amp;nbsp; An international order advanced by U.S. leadership that promotes peace, security, and opportunity through stronger cooperation to meet global challenges.
Each of these interests is inextricably linked to the others: no single interest can be pursued in isolation, but at the same time, positive action in one area will help advance all four."| ''National Security Strategy'', [[Executive Office of the President of the United States]] (May 2010)}}

====  Empowerment of women ====
{{main|Hillary Doctrine}}
U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] has said that "The countries that threaten regional and global peace are the very places where women and girls are deprived of dignity and opportunity".&lt;ref name="Lemmon 2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/04/the-hillary-doctrine-womens-rights-are-a-national-security-issue/274770/|title=The Hillary Doctrine: Women's Rights Are a National Security Issue|last=Lemmon|first=Gayle Tzemach|newspaper=the Atlantic|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has noted that countries where women are oppressed are places where the "rule of law and democracy are struggling to take root",&lt;ref name="Lemmon 2013" /&gt; and that, when women's rights as equals in society are upheld, the society as a whole changes and improves, which in turn enhances stability in that society, which in turn contributes to global society.&lt;ref name="Lemmon 2013" /&gt;

==== Cyber ====
In the United States, the Bush Administration in January 2008, initiated the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI). It introduced a differentiated approach, such as: identifying existing and emerging cybersecurity threats, finding and plugging existing cyber vulnerabilities, and apprehending actors that trying to gain access to secure federal information systems.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins, John, and Anna C. Henning. Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative Legal Authorities and Policy Considerations. Washington, D.C.: Congressional Research Service, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama issued a declaration that the "cyber threat is one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation" and that "America's economic prosperity in the 21st century will depend on cybersecurity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/cybersecurity|title=White House: Cybersecurity.|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529011144/http://www.whitehouse.gov/cybersecurity|archivedate=2013-05-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== National security state ====
To reflect on institutionalization of new bureaucratic infrastructures and governmental practices in the post-[[World War II]] period in the U.S., when a culture of semi-permanent military mobilization brought around the National Security Council, the CIA, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, national-security researchers apply a notion of a ''national security state'':&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Douglas T. Creating the National Security State: A History of the Law That Transformed America. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|9781400823772}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yergin, Daniel.

Globalization and the National Security State. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|During and after World War II, US leaders expanded the concept of national security and used its terminology for the first time to explain America’s relationship to the world. For most of US history, the physical security of the continental United States had not been in jeopardy. But by 1945, this invulnerability was rapidly diminishing with the advent of long-range bombers, atom bombs, and ballistic missiles. A general perception grew that the future would not allow time to mobilize, that preparation would have to become constant. For the first time, American leaders would have to deal with the essential paradox of national security faced by the Roman Empire and subsequent great powers: Si vis pacem, para bellum — If you want peace, prepare for war.&lt;ref&gt;David Jablonsky.

===Africa ===
Conceptualising and understanding the National Security choices and challenges of African States is a difficult task. This is due to the fact that it is often not rooted in the understanding of their (mostly disrupted) state formation and their often imported process of state building.

Although Post-Cold War conceptualizations of Security have broadened, the policies and practices of many African states still privilege national security as being synonymous with state security and even more narrowly- regime security.

The problem with the above is that a number of African states have been unable to govern their security in meaningful ways. Often failing to be able to claim the monopoly of force in their territories. A hybridity of security ‘governance’ or ‘providers’ thus exists.&lt;ref name="Luckham, R. 2012"&gt;Luckham, R., &amp; Kirk, T. (2012). Security in hybrid political contexts: An end-user approach.&lt;/ref&gt; States that have not been able to capture this reality in official National Security strategies and policies often find their claim over having the monopoly of force and thus being the Sovereign challenged.&lt;ref name="Luckham, R. 2012" /&gt; This often leads to the weakening of the state. Examples of such states are [[South Sudanese Civil War|South Sudan]] and [[Somali Civil War|Somalia]].

The Hague, 18 October 1907. |publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross]] |accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--The most famous example was [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Commando Order]] of 1942 during [[World War II]] which required that [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[commando]]s, whether in proper uniforms or not, were to be executed immediately without trial if apprehended behind German lines. After the war, at the [[Nuremberg Trials]], the Commando Order was found to be a direct breach of the laws of war, and German officers who carried out illegal executions under the Commando Order were found guilty of [[war crimes]].--&gt;

Since a judgment on the law relating to [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] in October 1946, the 1907 Hague Convention, including the  explicit prohibition to declare that no quarter will be given, is considered to be part of the [[Customary international law|customary laws of war]] and binding on all parties in an international armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/judlawre.asp Judgment: The Law Relating to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity] in the [[Avalon Project]] archive at [[Yale Law School]])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term may originate from an order by the commander of a victorious army that they "will not quarter (house)" captured enemy combatants. Therefore, none can be taken prisoner and all enemy combatants must be killed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] r.n.18.a derived from Quarter.n.15.a "Place of stay or residence; dwelling-place, lodgings, esp. of soldiers. Now usu. in pl."&lt;/ref&gt; A second derivation, given equal prominence in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED''), is that quarter (n.17) can mean "Relations with, or conduct towards, another" as in Shakespeare Oth. II. iii. 180, "Friends all..In Quarter, and in termes like Bride, and Groome." So "no quarter" may also mean refusal to enter into an agreement (relations) with an enemy attempting to surrender. The ''OED'' mentions a third possible derivation but says "The assertion of De Brieux (1672 ''{{lang|fr|Origines..de plusieurs façons de parler}}'', 16) that it arose in an agreement between the Dutch and Spaniards, by which the ransom of an officer or private was to be a quarter of his pay, is at variance with the constant sense of the phrases give and receive quarter."

The essay "'''Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question'''" was written by the Scottish essayist [[Thomas Carlyle]] about the acceptability of using [[Slavery|black slave]]s and [[indentured servitude|indentured servants]]. It was first anonymously published as an article in ''[[Fraser's Magazine|Fraser's Magazine for Town and Country]]'' of London in December, 1849,&lt;ref&gt;Carlyle, Thomas (1849). [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=inu.30000080778727;view=1up;seq=690 "Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question"], ''Fraser's Magazine for Town and Country'', Vol. XL, pp. 670–679.&lt;/ref&gt; and was reprinted as a pamphlet four years later with the title, "'''Occasional Discourse on the Nigger Question'''".&lt;ref&gt;Carlyle, Thomas (1853). ''Occasional Discourse on the Nigger Question''. London: Thomas Bosworth.&lt;/ref&gt; The essay was the spark of a debate between Carlyle and [[John Stuart Mill]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, David Theo (2008). "Liberalism's Limits: Carlyle and Mill on "the Negro Question'," ''Nineteenth-Century Contexts'', Vol. XX, No. 2, pp. 203–216.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in this essay that Carlyle first introduced the phrase "[[the dismal science]]" to characterize the field of [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlyle (1849), p. 672.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The article began as a [[devil's advocate]] work with the aim of challenging what Carlyle perceived to be a hypocritical philanthropic movement for the emancipation of West Indian slaves. Although the [[slave trade]] had been [[Slave Trade Act 1807|abolished in the British colonies]] by 1807, and in the [[British Empire]] by 1833, the USA, Cuba and Brazil continued to use slaves for economic advantage after 1838. In its original publication, Carlyle presented it as a speech "delivered by we know not whom" written down by an unreliable reporter by the name of "Phelin M'Quirk" (the fictitious "Absconded Reporter"). The manuscript was supposedly sold to the publisher by M'Quirk's landlady in lieu of unpaid rent &amp;ndash; she found it lying in his room after he ran off.

In its 1849 publication, a fictitious speaker makes various controversial points ranging from insults about the appearance and intelligence of black Africans to radical alternative solutions to the slavery problem.  These are probably opinions that Carlyle had gathered from the British under-class and from upper-class plantation owners, such as his friend [[John Sterling (author)|John Sterling]], and some of the other supporters of slavery he met in London, all fused into one. It brings the contemporary reader into the feelings and controversies of the time. The present-day reader might find some of the facts and figures hard to believe. The speaker suggests that the conditions on most [[slave ship]]s are not nearly as awful as the worst reported, and that many countries aside from Britain were involved in the slave trade, so that trying to stop it would be impossible. Additionally, he proposes that rather than simply setting slaves free, into a world of which they have little understanding, slave owners should be obliged to look after them like members of their families, by caring for them into old age. 

Throughout the delivery of the speech to the public, M'Quirk reports that members of the audience got up and left in disgust, suggesting how Carlyle expected the essay would be received. Just as he had expected, the work met with widespread disapproval, and in the minds of many people, Carlyle's reputation was forever tarnished. Carlyle's closest friends criticized him for his stand, but rather than back down he grew contrary and isolated. In later publications, the M'Quirk framework was entirely omitted, and Carlyle expressed the opinions as if they were his own.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

==Debate with John Stuart Mill==

[[John Stuart Mill]]'s reply, in the next issue of ''Fraser's Magazine'', under the title, "The Negro question" was also published anonymously.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart (1850). [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044092641992;view=1up;seq=33 "The Negro Question"]. ''Fraser's Magazine for Town and Country''. Vol. XLI, pp. 25–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3293">'''Optional preferential voting''' (OPV) is a type of [[preferential voting system|preferential]] [[electoral system|voting system]] under which voters may choose to mark a preference for one candidate (effectively voting as though it were a [[first-past-the-post]] election), all candidates or any number of candidates in between. Although complete numbering is not required under the OPV system (effectively [[full-preferential voting]], also known as [[Instant-runoff voting]] (IRV)), single-preference voters may be required to use a '1' rather than a tick or cross. Some jurisdictions allow ticks or crosses as the voter's intention is clear.

OPV is used in elections in [[New South Wales]] and the [[Northern Territory]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.nsw.gov.au/about_elections/voting_and_counting_systems/optional_preferential Optional Preferential: Elections NSW]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2016/02/northern-territory-adopts-optional-preferential-voting-and-bans-campaigning-near-polling-places.html Northern Territory Adopts Optional Preferential Voting and Bans Campaigning Near Polling Places: Antony Green ABC 11 February 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in [[Queensland]] from 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Queensland Electoral System|url=https://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/explore/about-us/parliament-overview/queensland-electoral-system|website=Queensland Parliament|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burke|first1=Gail|title=Compulsory preferential voting returns to Queensland as Parliament passes bill for more MPs|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-21/compulsory-prefential-voting-returns-qld-parliament-passes-bill/7348172|accessdate=15 December 2017|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both the [[Tasmanian House of Assembly]] and the [[Tasmanian Legislative Council]], ''semi-optional'' voting is used, with a minimum number of preferences required to be expressed; but there is no requirement to complete the entire ballot paper. All other Australian lower house elections are use full-preferential voting, where a preference for every candidate must be indicated for the vote to be counted. 

In the [[Victorian Legislative Council]], semi-optional voting is used if a voter chooses to vote [[Above-the-line voting|below the line]].

The [[Australian Senate]] voting reform of 2016 switched from full-preferential voting to semi-optional. A minimum number is specified in the instructions on the ballot paper. Since in the past a single number '1' [[Above-the-line voting|above the line]] was formal, that is still a valid vote even though voters are encouraged to number six squares.

In other countries, such as [[Malta]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], and [[Northern Ireland]], full preferences are not required.

The "ranked-choice voting" system used by [[Maine]], USA, can be considered optional-preferential as voters are allowed to rank just one candidate. The system also allows voters to "skip" one ranking (e.g. marking a first choice and a third choice, but not a second choice). In that case, the next ranking would be advanced to the next highest ranking.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3283">The '''OssaTron''' is a high energy [[shock wave]] system that provides a non-surgical alternative for patients diagnosed with chronic proximal plantar fasciopathy (severe heel pain), usually referred to as [[fasciitis]]. Using a unique process known as [[Orthotripsy]], the OssaTron emits shock waves, similar to those used to treat [[kidney stones]], in an attempt to increase [[blood]] flow and stimulate healing of the affected heel.&lt;ref name="ossatron"&gt;[http://www.drdavidbartos.com/ossatron.htm Non Invasive treatment of Heel Pain], accessed March 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Device==
The OssaTron is the first shock wave unit developed especially for orthopaedic applications. The OssaTron covers a range of orthopaedic indications suitable for Shock Wave Technology. It is marketed as the only Extracorporeal Shock Wave Technology (ESWT) system approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for the treatment of multiple orthopaedic conditions. The OssaTron is currently FDA approved to treat chronic [[plantar fasciitis]] (heel pain) and chronic [[lateral epicondylitis]] (tennis elbow) when these conditions have failed to respond to conservative treatments.&lt;ref&gt;sanuwave.com, [http://www.sanuwave.com/products/ High-performance Extracorporeal Shock Wave Technology (ESWT) device], accessed, March 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
Once [[anesthesia]] has been administered, high viscosity [[ultrasound]] [[gel]] is applied to the area experiencing pain (target tissue). The gel promotes shock wave conductance, enhancing treatment effectiveness. The Ossatron Application Technician then activates the shock wave via the shock wave release hand piece on the console.&lt;ref name="ossatron"/&gt;

==Post-procedure==
It is recommended after treatment that the patient restrict "stressful activity" such as [[jogging]], heavy housework or yard work, and participating in sports for four weeks. Pain relief begins for patients at different times. For some patients it is immediate; for others it may take four weeks. The full effect of the OssaTron procedure may not be realized until the twelfth week following treatment. If relief has not been achieved at this point, a second OssaTron procedure may be recommended by the patient's physician.&lt;ref name="ossatron"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=ap-heat-wade Wade has shock wave treatment on left knee], March 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==
A class action lawsuit settlement approved by a federal judge suggests that the manufacturer of the Ossatron made material misrepresentations and/or omitted to make material disclosures concerning the efficiency, testing and market acceptance of the OssaTron. According to the lawsuit the manufacturer failed to disclose to investors that some of its own tests failed to support its statements that the OssaTron was more effective, safer and less costly than alternative, nonsurgical treatments for heel pain and that serious questions existed among the medical community concerning the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave treatment (ESWT) for heel pain. See ''Thomas v. HealthTronics Surgical Services, et al.''. US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Civil Case No. 03-cv-2800.

The '''Peasants Party of Serbia''' ({{Lang-sr|Сељачка странка Србије}} or ''Seljačka stranka Srbije'') was a [[political party]] in [[Serbia]].

==History==
It was founded on 26 October 1990 in [[Kragujevac]] by [[Milomir Babić]] at which point it was called the Party of the Serbian Peasants Union.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Thomas: [https://books.google.com/books?id=ih_Is_q4Rz8C&amp;lpg=PR19&amp;pg=PA65 Serbia under Milošević: politics in the 1990s], p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 1990|1990 legislative election]], it won 1,1% and 2 seats in two districts. The elected MPs were Milomir Babić in [[Desimirovac]] and Ljubomir Dodić in [[Milutovac]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rik.parlament.gov.rs/doc/arhiva/poslanici/1990/1990%20izvestaj%20o%20ukupnim%20rezultatima%20np.pdf Izveštaj o ukupnim rezultatima izbora za narodne poslanike u Narodnu skupštinu Republike Srbije 9. i 23. decembra 1990. godine] (in Serbian)&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 1992|1992 legislative election]] it won 2,7% and 3 seats.

During 1993 the PPS was part of the [[DEPOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Former Yugoslavia: Prospects and Problems |journal=RFE/RL Research Report: Weekly Analyses from the RFE/RL Research Institute |date=1992 |volume=1 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it decided to run in the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 1993|1993 election]] alone in November 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Markov |first1=Mladen |title=SSS samostalno na izbore - Ništa od koalicije |url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/soc.culture.yugoslavia/zRYKFkaiPe8 |publisher=Srpske Novine |accessdate=15 October 2018 |language=Serbian |date=10 November 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 [[Živko Selaković]] was elected party president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdpsrbije.rs/zivko-selakovic/ Biography of Živko Selaković, Social Democratic Party of Serbia] (in Serbian)&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Serbian general election, 1997|1997 election]] it was part of an alliance around the [[Democratic Alternative (Serbia)|Democratic Alternative]] headed by [[Nebojša Čović]] and won no seats. 

Two splinter groups led by Radosav Drezgić from [[Dublje (Bogatić)|Dublje]] and Ljubomir Dodić from Milutovac ran in the 1997 election independently from Selaković's PPS. Drezgić's group won 0.05% running only in [[Šabac]] independently, and Dodić's group won 0.04% running only in [[Kruševac]] in coalition with [[Milan Paroški|Paroški's]] [[People's Party (Serbia)|People's Party]]. Neither won any seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rik.parlament.gov.rs/arhiva-izbori-za-narodne-poslanike-1997.php Republic Electoral Commission, 1997 election] (in Serbian)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2000|2000 election]] the PPS was part of the [[Party of Serbian Unity]] list and won one seat, awarded to Živko Selaković. 

On 23 January 2003 it formed a new parliamentary group "Serbia" with the United Pensioners' Party and three former members of [[New Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Formiran novi poslanički klub Srbija |url=https://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2003&amp;mm=01&amp;dd=23&amp;nav_category=11&amp;nav_id=81834 |publisher=B92 |accessdate=19 August 2018 |language=Serbian |date=23 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; One day later, the UPP withdrew from the parliamentary group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Berza poslanika najunosniji posao |url=https://www.blic.rs/vesti/politika/berza-poslanika-najunosniji-posao/23ermc4 |publisher=Blic |accessdate=19 August 2018 |language=Serbian |date=25 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later joined by the [[People's Peasant Party]], which was expelled from the [[Vojvodina Coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Milošević |first1=Milan |title=Ustavna povelja u skupštini Srbije - Svetosavska računaljka |url=https://www.vreme.com//cms/view.php?id=331929&amp;print=no |accessdate=19 August 2018 |issue=630 |publisher=Vreme |date=30 January 2003 |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 February 2003 a bomb was set outside Selaković's family home in [[Žarkovo]]. Allegedly, he had been receiving threats from Party of Serbian Unity leaders [[Borislav Pelević]] and [[Dragan Marković Palma]].

On 8 October 2003, after a meeting with delegates from the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]] headed by [[Gordana Čomić]], Selaković stated that the PPS supported the government in "achieving its goals regarding reform".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Seljačka stranka Srbije podržava Vladu |url=https://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2003&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=08&amp;nav_category=11&amp;nav_id=121494 |publisher=B92 |accessdate=19 August 2018 |language=Serbian |date=8 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2003|2003 election]], Živko Selaković ran on the [[Labour Party of Serbia]] list, led by the then [[Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Policy (Serbia)|Minister of Labour]] [[Dragan Milovanović (politician)|Dragan Milovanović]]. The list won 0,1% and no seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rik.parlament.gov.rs/doc/arhiva/poslanici/2003/LAT/2003%20IZBORNE%20LISTE%20-%20LAT/1.17%20Laburisticka%20partija%20Srbije%20LAT.doc Labour Party of Serbia electoral list, 2003] (in Serbian)&lt;/ref&gt; Another fraction of the party led by Milomir Babić, under the name '''Peasants Party''' ({{Lang-sr|Сељачка странка}} or ''Seljačka stranka''), ran on the [[Independent Serbia (political alliance)|Independent Serbia]] list, which won 1,2% and no seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rik.parlament.gov.rs/doc/arhiva/poslanici/2003/LAT/2003%20IZBORNE%20LISTE%20-%20LAT/1.10%20Samostalna%20Srbija%20LAT.doc Independent Serbia electoral list, 2003] (in Serbian)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 December 2009 the PPS merged into the [[Social Democratic Party of Serbia]] and ceased to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Seljačka stranka Srbije pristupila SDPS |url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/politika/aktuelno.289.html:261248-Seljacka-stranka-Srbije-pristupila-SDPS |publisher=Večernje novosti |accessdate=19 August 2018 |language=Serbian |date=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Primeira Linha''' ('''First Line''' in [[Galician language]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Reintegrationism|Reintegrationist]] standard.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[communist]] organization which is part of the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] Movement of National Liberation, which seeks, "to overcome the concrete national and social oppression imposed by capitalism on [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], in order to contribute to the worldwide construction of a communist society."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primeiralinha.org] First Line's official website&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:III-jigb.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Second Galician Independentist Conference. Compostela, March, 1999]]

==Foundation and first stage inside the Galician Nationalist Bloc==

Primeira Linha was formed in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], in 1996, with the objective of organizing the independentist and communist groups which were within the [[Bloque Nacionalista Galego|Galician Nationalist Bloc]] (BNG). Primeira Linha remained a part of the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc|BNG]], but was in constant conflict with the current controlling power, the [[Galician People's Union]].

During this time, Primeira Linha was working with other militant organizations, such as ANA-ANOC and [[Comités Abertos de Faculdade|CAF]], among others. In 1998, Primeira Linha held its first congress. Given the contradictions and conflicts resulting from the political work within the [[Bloque Nacionalista Galego|Galician Nationalist Bloc]], Primeira Linha members resolved to leave the [[Bloque Nacionalista Galego|Nationalist Bloc]] in 1999, after the majority decision was made at their second congress.

In its quarterly publication, ''Abrente'', Primeira Linha explained that, "An unbreathable climate of harassment was obstructing our political work, it was forcing us to use vast energies and resources in mere defense."&lt;ref&gt;Documents of the second Congress, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independentist Reorganization out of the Galician Nationalist Block==

The second congress also set forth a policy of unity and collaboration with other independentist organizations outside the Galician Nationalist Block. They allied with the AMI and the FPG, with the goal of forming an organic whole.

They called this conglomeration the National Unit Commission of the Independentist Left, a dynamic unit which broke apart in 2000 because of differing expectations from each organization. That same year, Primeira Linha participated in the creation of "Popular Regional Meetings", which formed the precedent for the ''Processo Espiral'', which led to the creation, in 2001, of [[Nós-Unidade Popular|NÓS-Unidade Popular]].

Primeira Linha has been doing political work in the heart of [[Nós-Unidade Popular]] since 2001, and has also participated in youth organizations, independent student organizations, and feminist, cultural and trade unions.

==Model of Socialism==

In 2002, Primeira Linha held its third congress, in which the members defined the organization's theoretical model of socialism, and worked out, "the essential composition and working direction of the movement for Galicia's national liberation", rejecting the traditional inter-class formula  used by earlier nationalist organizations. Primeira Linha also affirmed that, "the morphology of classes in Galicia is more similar to that of advanced capitalist societies than of the so-called [[Third World]].&lt;ref&gt;Documents of the third Congress, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications and Supporting Activities==

Giving priority to their work within larger entities and other sectors of the Galician national left, Primeira Linha maintains several publications supporting its own initiatives. Since 1996, Primeira Linha has published its quarterly newspaper, ''Abrente'', which already exceedes fifty editions. In its editorial stamp, ''Abrente Editora'', numerous titles were published, as well some [[Marxist]] classics previously unpublished in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and other works of Galician authors.

Primeira Linha has also been organizing the annual Galician Independentist Conference for the last ten years.

'''Sejong''' ({{IPA-ko|se(ː).dʑoŋ}}; {{Korean |hangul=세종 |hanja=世宗}}), officially '''Sejong Special Autonomous City'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.ngii.go.kr/en/download/Toponymic_Guidelines_ROK.pdf Toponymic Guidelines for Map and Other Editors For International Use Republic of Korea, Second Edition], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Korean |labels=no |hangul=세종특별자치시 |hanja=世宗特別自治市}}) and formerly known as [[Yeongi]] ({{Korean |labels=no |hangul=연기 |hanja=燕岐}}) County is [[South Korea]]'s central administrative city. In early 2007, the [[South Korean government]] created a special administrative district from parts of [[South Chungcheong Province]] and [[North Chungcheong Province]] provinces, near [[Daejeon]], to relocate nine ministries and four national agencies from [[Seoul]]. The new offices opened on 2 July 2012, with 36 government agencies slated to move there by 2015.&lt;ref name="open"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18670195 |title=South Korea opens 'mini capital' in Sejong City |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2012-02-07 |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=November 2018}}

==Name==
Sejong was named in honor of the [[Joseon|Joseon Dynasty]] King [[Sejong the Great]], the father of Korea's [[Hangul|national alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3554296.stm|title=S Korea chooses new capital site|date=2004-08-11|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was originally called [[Yeongi County]] ({{Korean|labels=no|연기군|燕岐郡}}).

== History ==
In 2003, former President [[Roh Moo-hyun]] of the [[Democratic Party (South Korea, 2011)|Democratic Party]] (now [[Together Democratic Party]]) sought to relocate the national capital of South Korea from the metropolitan city of Seoul to a new multifunctional administrative city in the centre of the country. The goal was to reduce the influence and dominance of Seoul on national governance and economics, whilst promoting the regional development of other areas of the country.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sejong City to open Sunday|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20120628001115|website=Korea Herald|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to former Home Administration Minister Maeng Hyung-gyu in 2012, “Sejong is a symbol of the country’s efforts toward more balanced regional development,” helping to decongest Seoul and spur [[investment]] in the country’s central region.

In October 2004, the [[Constitutional Court of Korea|Constitutional Court]] dealt a setback to President Roh's plans, ruling that the capital must remain in Seoul in response to a complaint filed by the main opposition [[Grand National Party]] (now [[Liberty Korea Party]]). As such, the Roh administration was forced to modify the project to relocate the majority of ministries and government institutes to Sejong, which would become a special administrative city instead of a new capital. The revised plan was approved by the parliament in March 2005. Challenges to the new plan were rejected by the Constitutional Court in November 2005.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

When the Conservative [[Grand National Party]] retook the presidential office in 2008, President [[Lee Myung-bak]] opposed the idea of moving government agencies, claiming that it would hurt the capital’s global competitiveness and result in inefficiency.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Plans were made to make Sejong an industrial, science and education hub instead. This plan was opposed by many, including Roh’s allies and some members of the ruling [[Grand National Party]], including Lee’s archrival and eventual successor [[Park Geun-hye]]. Defeat in the mid-2010 local elections forced Lee to present the proposal to the National Assembly, which voted them down.

As of 2014, 36 central government offices, including nine ministries, and 16 state-run organisations have moved into the city. However, the national assembly and many important government bodies are still in Seoul.

In July 2012 Sejong was created incorporating all of [[Yeongi County]], three townships of [[Gongju]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?biid=2010011293448 |title=Sejong City to Become Biz Hub, Not Gov't District}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one township of [[Cheongwon County]].

In April 2013 the government of [[Putrajaya]], [[Malaysia]] signed a [[letter of intent]] (LOI) with the government of Sejong City to mark cooperation between the two cities.

==Geography==
Sejong is located between three other major Korean cities: [[Daejeon]], [[Cheonan]] and [[Cheongju]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} It is about {{convert|121|km|mi}} from [[Seoul]],&lt;ref name=Harlan&gt;Harlan, Chico (Contributing: Yoonjung Seo) "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/with-new-sejong-city-south-korean-government-aims-to-rebalance-power/2012/08/17/e8f6dc60-e2bd-11e1-a25e-15067bb31849_story.html With new Sejong City, South Korean government aims to rebalance power]." ''[[Washington Post]]''. August 17, 2012. Retrieved on December 31, 2013. "But critics — including President Lee Myung-bak, who did not attend a recent launch ceremony here — say it’s crazy to set parts of the administration 75 miles apart."&lt;!--Meaning Seoul is 75 miles away--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and is notably further from [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|the DMZ]] in the event of a North Korean attack.

===Cityscape===
As of 2012 much of the city was under construction. The residential area, by 2012, had several high-rises built for transferees. At that time the residential area was cordoned off from much of the under-development governmental area and had some restaurants, six schools, and one grocery store.

==Administrative divisions==
{{main|List of subdivisions of Sejong}}

{{short description|cardinal principle in modern international law principles of international law}}

The right of a people to '''self-determination''' is a cardinal principle in modern [[international law]] (commonly regarded as a ''[[jus cogens]]'' rule), binding, as such, on the [[United Nations]] as authoritative interpretation of the Charter's norms.&lt;ref&gt;''See'': [[s:United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514|United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514]] in [[Wikisource]] states&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Self-Determination of Peoples and Plural-Ethnic States in Contemporary International Law: Failed States, Nation-Building and the Alternative, Federal Option |last=McWhinney |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward McWhinney |year=2007 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |location= |isbn=9004158359 |page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that a people, based on respect for the principle of equal rights and fair [[equal opportunity|equality of opportunity]], have the right to freely choose their [[sovereignty]] and international [[political status]] with no interference.&lt;ref&gt;''See'': [[Charter of the United Nations|Chapter I - Purposes and Principles of Charter of the United Nations]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was first expressed in the 1860s, and spread rapidly thereafter.&lt;ref name=Fisch&gt;{{cite book|author=Jörg Fisch|title=A History of the Self-Determination of Peoples: The Domestication of an Illusion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PETjCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118|date=9 December 2015|page=118|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-03796-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Knudsen&gt;http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/923/1/Knudsen_Moments_of_Self-determination.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; During and after [[World War I]], the principle was encouraged by both [[Vladimir Lenin]] and United States President [[Woodrow Wilson]].&lt;ref name=Fisch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Knudsen/&gt; Having announced his [[Fourteen Points]] on 8 January 1918, on 11 February 1918 Wilson stated: "National aspirations must be respected; people may now be dominated and governed only by their own consent. 'Self determination' is not a mere phrase; it is an imperative principle of action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwpda.org/1918/wilpeace.html|title=President Wilson's Address to Congress, Analyzing German and Austrian Peace Utterances (Delivered to Congress in Joint Session on February 11, 1918)|date=February 11, 1918|website=gwpda.org|accessdate=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], the principle was included in the [[Atlantic Charter]], signed on 14 August 1941, by [[Franklin D.

=== Pre-20th century ===

==== Origins ====

The employment of [[imperialism]], through the expansion of empires, and the concept of political sovereignty, as developed after the [[Treaty of Westphalia]], also explain the emergence of self-determination during the modern era.  During, and after, the [[Industrial Revolution]] many groups of people recognized their shared history, geography, language, and customs. [[Nationalism]] emerged as a uniting ideology not only between competing powers, but also for groups that felt subordinated or disenfranchised inside larger states; in this situation, self-determination can be seen as a reaction to imperialism.  Such groups often pursued independence and sovereignty over territory, but sometimes a different sense of autonomy has been pursued or achieved.

==== Empires ====

The world possessed several traditional, continental empires such as the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]], [[Austrian Empire|Austrian/Habsburg]], and the [[Qing Empire]].  Political scientists often define competition in Europe during the [[Modern Era]] as a [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] struggle, which also induced various European states to pursue colonial empires, beginning with the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], and later including the [[British Empire|British]], [[French colonial empire|French]], [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], and [[German colonial empire|German]].
During the early 19th century, competition in Europe produced multiple wars, most notably the [[Napoleonic Wars]].  After this conflict, the British Empire became dominant and entered its [[Britain's Imperial Century|"imperial century"]], while nationalism became a powerful political ideology in Europe.

Later, after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870, "[[New Imperialism]]" was unleashed with [[Second French colonial empire|France]] and later [[German colonial empire|Germany]] establishing colonies in Asia, the Pacific, and Africa.  Japan also emerged as a new power.  Multiple theaters of competition developed across the world:

* Africa: multiple European states competed for colonies in the "[[Scramble for Africa]]";
* Central Asia: [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[British Empire|Britain]] competed for domination in the "[[Great Game]]"
* Eastern Asia: colonies and various [[spheres of influence]] were established, largely to the detriment of the [[Qing Empire]].

The Ottoman Empire, Austrian Empire, Russian Empire, Qing Empire and the new [[Empire of Japan]] maintained themselves, often expanding or contracting at the expense of another empire.  All ignored notions of self-determination for those governed.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson J. Spielvogel, ''Western Civilization: Since 1500 '', [https://books.google.com/books?id=fwxLkRmd-4QC&amp;pg=PT421 p. 767], Cengage Learning, 2008, {{ISBN|0-495-50287-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-495-50287-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rebellions and emergence of nationalism ====
{{Nationalism sidebar |Core}}
The revolt of [[New World]] British colonists in North America, during the mid-1770s, has been seen as the first assertion of the right of national and democratic self-determination, because of the explicit invocation of natural law, the natural rights of man, as well as the consent of, and sovereignty by, the people governed; these ideas were inspired particularly by [[John Locke]]'s [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightened]] writings of the previous century. [[Thomas Jefferson]] further promoted the notion that the will of the people was supreme, especially through authorship of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] which inspired Europeans throughout the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Unterberger" /&gt; The French Revolution was motivated similarly and legitimatized the ideas of self-determination on that [[Old World]] continent.&lt;ref&gt;Chimène Keitner, [[Oxford University]], [http://www.ciaonet.org/isa/woc01/National Self-Determination: The Legacy of the French Revolution], paper presented at International Studies Association Annual Meeting, March 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60B16FD3D5C147A93C2AB178CD85F4D8185F9 "Self-Determination Not a New Expedient; First Plebiscite Was Held in Avignon During the French Revolution—Forthcoming Book Traces History and Growth of the Movement"], ''[[New York Times]]'', July 20, 1919, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the New World during the early 19th century, most of the nations of [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] achieved [[Spanish American wars of independence|independence from Spain]]. The United States supported that status, as policy in the hemisphere relative to European colonialism, with the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. The American public, organized associated groups, and Congressional resolutions, often supported such movements, particularly the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821–29) and the [[12 points of the Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1848|demands of Hungarian revolutionaries in 1848]]. Such support, however, never became official government policy, due to balancing of other [[national interests]]. After the [[American Civil War]] and with increasing capability, the United States government did not accept self-determination as a basis during its [[Purchase of Alaska]] and attempted purchase of the West Indian islands of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]] and [[St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint John]] in the 1860s, or its growing influence in the [[Hawaii]]an Islands, that led to annexation in 1898. With its victory in the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1899 and its growing stature in the world, the United States supported annexation of the former Spanish colonies of [[Guam]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the Philippines, without the consent of their peoples, and it retained "quasi-[[suzerainty]]" over Cuba, as well.&lt;ref name="Unterberger" /&gt;

Nationalist sentiments emerged inside the traditional empires including: [[Pan-Slavism]] in Russia; [[Ottomanism]], [[Kemalist ideology]] and [[Arab nationalism]] in the Ottoman Empire; [[State Shintoism]] and [[Japanese nationalism|Japanese identity]] in Japan; and [[Chinese nationalism|Han identity]] in juxtaposition to the [[Manchu people|Manchurian ruling class]] in China. Meanwhile, in Europe itself there was a [[Rise of nationalism in Europe|rise of nationalism]], with nations such as [[Greek War of Independence|Greece]], [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungary]], [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)|Poland]] and [[Bulgarian unification|Bulgaria]] seeking or winning their independence.

[[Karl Marx]] supported such nationalism, believing it might be a "prior condition" to social reform and international alliances.&lt;ref&gt;Erica Benner, ‘’Really existing nationalisms: a post-communist view from Marx and Engels’‘, [https://books.google.com/books?id=N-7Xc8WtCLgC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=%22self-determination%22+of+colonies+marx&amp;ei=HLAGS6bRHafgyASj-_2_Dw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 188], Oxford University Press, 1995 {{ISBN|0-19-827959-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-827959-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914 [[Vladimir Lenin]] wrote: "[It] would be wrong to interpret the right to self-determination as meaning anything but the right to existence as a separate state."&lt;ref name="Lenin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/self-det/ch01.htm#v20pp72-395 |title=What Is Meant By The Self-Determination of Nations? |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Wars I and II ===

==== Europe, Asia and Africa ====

[[Woodrow Wilson]] revived America's commitment to self-determination, at least for European states, during World War I. When the [[Bolsheviks]] came to power in Russia in November 1917, they called for Russia's immediate withdrawal as a member of the [[Allies of World War I]]. They also supported the right of all nations, including colonies, to self-determination."&lt;ref name="Lenin" /&gt; The 1918 [[1918 Soviet Constitution|Constitution of the Soviet Union]] acknowledged the right of [[secession]] for its constituent republics.&lt;ref name="Unterberger" /&gt;

This presented a challenge to Wilson's more limited demands. In January 1918 Wilson issued his [[Fourteen Points]] of January 1918 which, among other things, called for adjustment of colonial claims, insofar as the interests of colonial powers had equal weight with the claims of subject peoples.&lt;ref name="Unterberger" /&gt; The [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] in March 1918 led to Soviet Russia's exit from the war and the nominal independence of Armenia, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Georgia and Poland, though in fact those territories were under German control. The end of the war led to the dissolution of the defeated [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and [[Czechoslovakia]] and the union of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] as new states out of the wreckage of the Habsburg empire. However, this imposition of states where some nationalities (especially Poles, Czechs, and Serbs and [[Romanians]]) were given power over nationalities who disliked and distrusted them eventually used as a pretext for German aggression in World War II.

One of the German objections to the Treaty of Versailles was a somewhat selective application of the principle of self-determination as the majority of the people in Austria and in the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia wanted to join Germany while the majority of people in Danzig wanted to remain within the ''Reich'', but the Allies ignored the German objections. Wilson's 14 Points had called for Polish independence to be restored and Poland to have "secure access to the sea", which would imply that the German city of Danzig (modern Gdańsk, Poland), which occupied a strategic location where the Vistula river flowed into the Baltic sea, be ceded to Poland.&lt;ref name="Macmillan, Margaret page 211"&gt;Macmillan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House page 211.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the Paris peace conference in 1919, the Polish delegation led by [[Roman Dmowski]] asked for Wilson to honor point 14 of the 14 points by transferring Danzig to Poland. arguing that Poland would not be economically viable without Danzig.&lt;ref name="Macmillan, Margaret page 211"/&gt; However, as the 90% of the people in Danzig in this period were German, the Allied leaders at the Paris peace conference compromised by creating the [[Free City of Danzig]], a city-state in which Poland had certain special rights.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House page 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the city of Danzig was 90% German and 10% Polish, the surrounding countryside around Danzig was overwhelmingly Polish, and the ethnically Polish rural areas included in the Free City of Danzig objected, arguing that they wanted to be part of Poland.&lt;ref name="Macmillan, Margaret page 211"/&gt; Neither the Poles nor the Germans were happy with this compromise and the Danzig issue became a flash-point of German-Polish tension throughout the interwar period.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House page 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany lost land after WWI: Northern Schleswig voted to return to Denmark after [[Schleswig plebiscites, 1920|a referendum]]. On 11 July 1920, the [[East Prussian plebiscite, 1920|East Prussian plebiscite]] called for by the Treaty of Versailles led to two disputed regions between Germany and Poland choosing the former. In 1921, a plebiscite in Silesia concerning partitioning the region between Germany and Poland led to fighting breaking out between the ethnic German and ethnic Polish residents of Silesia. The defeated [[Ottoman empire]] was dissolved into the [[Republic of Turkey]] and several smaller nations, including [[Yemen]], plus the new [[Middle East]] [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] "[[League of Nations mandate|mandates]]" of [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|Syria and Lebanon]] (future Syria, Lebanon and [[Hatay State]]), [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] (future [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] and [[Israel]]), [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]] (future Iraq). In 1919, a Greek attempt to add the mostly Greek-speaking western regions of Anatolia led to a war between Greece and Turkey when the Greeks occupied the largely Greek-speaking city of Smyrna (modern İzmir, Turkey) in May 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, Margaret ''Paris 1919'', New York: Random House page 352.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, the Greeks were defeated and under the terms of the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne compulsorily population exchanges led to almost all the Turks in Greece being expelled into Turkey and almost all of the Greeks in Turkey being expelled into Greece. The [[League of Nations]] was proposed as much as a means of consolidating these new states, as a path to peace.&lt;ref name="Rothbard"&gt;[[Murray N. Rothbard]], [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard134.html National Self-Determination], Rothbard Archives at [[Lewrockwell.com]], August 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s and 1930s there were some successful movements for self-determination in the beginnings of the process of [[decolonization]]. In the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] the United Kingdom granted independence to Canada, New Zealand, [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], the [[Irish Free State]], the Commonwealth of Australia, and the [[Union of South Africa]] after the [[British parliament]] declared itself as incapable of passing laws over them without their consent. Egypt, Afghanistan and Iraq also achieved independence from Britain and Lebanon from France. Other efforts were unsuccessful, like the [[Indian independence movement]]. And Italy, Japan and Germany all initiated new efforts to bring certain territories under their control, leading to World War II. In particular, the [[National Socialist Program]] invoked this right of nations in its first point (out of 25), as it was publicly proclaimed on 24 February 1920 by [[Adolf Hitler]].

In Asia, Japan became a rising power and gained more respect from Western powers after its victory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]].  Japan joined the Allied Powers in World War I and [[Japan during World War I|attacked German colonial possessions]] in the Far East, adding former German possessions to its own empire.  In the 1930s, Japan gained significant influence in [[Inner Mongolia]] and [[Manchuria]] after it [[Mukden Incident|invaded Manchuria]].  It established [[Manchukuo]], a [[puppet state]] in Manchuria and eastern Inner Mongolia. This was essentially the model Japan followed as it invaded other areas in Asia and established the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. Japan went to considerable trouble to argue that Manchukuo was justified by the principle of self-determination, claiming that people of Manchuria wanted to break away from China and asked the [[Kwantung Army]] to intervene on their behalf. However, the Lytton commission which had been appointed by the League of Nations to decide if Japan had committed aggression or not, stated the majority of people in Manchuria who were Han Chinese who did not wish to leave China.

In 1912, the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] officially [[successor state|succeeded]] the Qing Dynasty, while [[Outer Mongolia]], [[Tibet (1912 – 1951)|Tibet]] and [[Tannu Uriankhai|Tuva]] proclaimed their independence. Independence was not accepted by the government of China. By the [[Treaty of Kyakhta (1915)]] [[Outer Mongolia, 1911-1919|Outer Mongolia]] recognized China's sovereignty. However, the Soviet threat of seizing parts of Inner Mongolia induced China to recognize Outer Mongolia's independence, provided that a referendum was held. The referendum took place on October 20, 1945, with (according to official numbers) 100% of the electorate voting for independence.

Many of Eastern Asia's current disputes to sovereignty and self-determination stem from unresolved disputes from World War II.  After its fall, the [[Empire of Japan]] renounced control over many of its former possessions including Korea, [[Sakhalin Island]], and [[Taiwan]].  In none of these areas were the opinions of affected people consulted, or given significant priority. Korea was specifically granted independence but the receiver of various other areas was not stated in the [[Treaty of San Francisco]], giving Taiwan ''de facto'' independence although its political status continues to be ambiguous.

=== The Cold War world ===

==== The UN Charter and resolutions====

In 1941 [[Allies of World War II]] declared the [[Atlantic Charter]] and accepted the principle of self-determination. In January 1942 twenty-six states signed the [[Declaration by United Nations]], which accepted those principles. The ratification of the United Nations Charter in 1945 at the end of World War II placed the right of self-determination into the framework of international law and diplomacy.

* Chapter 1, Article 1, part 2 states that purpose of the UN Charter is: "To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/ |title=United Nations Charter |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development. "
* The United Nations [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] article 15 states that everyone has the right to a nationality and that no one should be arbitrarily deprived of a nationality or denied the right to change nationality.

[[File:Colonization 1945.png|thumb|right|upright=1.7|Western European [[colonial empire]]s in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]] disintegrated after World War II]]
On 14 December 1960, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514 (XV)]] subtitled "[[Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples]]", which supported the granting of [[independence]] to [[Colonialism|colonial]] countries and people by providing an inevitable legal linkage between self-determination and its goal of decolonisation.  It postulated a new international law-based right of [[Liberty|freedom]] to exercise economic self-determination. Article 5 states: Immediate steps shall be taken in [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|Trust and Non-Self-Governing Territories]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/decolonization/nonselfgov.shtml |title=Trust and Non-Self-Governing Territories listed by the United Nations General Assembly |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; or all other territories which have not yet attained independence, to transfer all powers to the people of those territories, without any conditions or reservations, in accordance with their freely expressed will and desire, without any distinction as to race, creed or colour, in order to enable them to enjoy complete independence and freedom.

On 15 December 1960 the United Nations General Assembly adopted [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1541 (XV)]], subtitled "Principles which should guide members in determining whether or nor an obligation exists to transmit the information called for under [[Chapter XI of the United Nations Charter|Article 73e]] of the [[United Nations Charter]] in Article 3", which provided that "[t]he inadequacy of political, economic, social and educational preparedness should never serve as a pretext for delaying the right to self-determination and independence." To monitor the implementation of [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514 (XV)|Resolution 1514]], in 1961 the General Assembly created the Special Committee referred to popularly as the [[Special Committee on Decolonization]]&lt;ref&gt;''See'': [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1654 (XVI)]]&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure [[decolonization]] complete compliance with the principles of self-determination in General Assembly Resolution 1541 (XV).&lt;ref&gt;''See'': [http://unyearbook.un.org/1960YUN/1960_P1_SEC3_CH4.pdf General Assembly 15th Session - resolution 1541 (XV)] (pages: 509-510) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320074502/http://unyearbook.un.org/1960YUN/1960_P1_SEC3_CH4.pdf |date=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See'': {{sourcetext|source=United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See'': [http://unyearbook.un.org/1960YUN/1960_P1_SEC3_CH4.pdf United Nations General Assembly 15th Session - The Trusteeship System and Non-Self-Governing Territories (pages: 509-510)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320074502/http://unyearbook.un.org/1960YUN/1960_P1_SEC3_CH4.pdf |date=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the charter and other resolutions did not insist on full independence as the best way of obtaining [[self-government]], nor did they include an enforcement mechanism. Moreover, new states were recognized by the legal doctrine of [[uti possidetis juris]], meaning that old administrative boundaries would become international boundaries upon independence if they had little relevance to linguistic, ethnic, and cultural boundaries.&lt;ref name="Hensel"&gt;Paul R.

==== The communist versus capitalist worlds ====
{{See also|Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War}}

Decolonization in the world was contrasted by the Soviet Union's successful post-war expansionism. [[People's Republic of Tuva|Tuva]] and several regional states in [[Eastern Europe]], the Baltic, and Central Asia had been fully annexed by the Soviet Union during World War II. Now, it extended its influence by establishing [[satellite states]] Eastern Germany and the countries of Eastern Europe, along with support for revolutionary movements in China and North Korea. Although satellite states were independent and possessed sovereignty, the Soviet Union violated principles of self-determination by suppressing the [[Hungarian revolution of 1956]] and the [[Prague Spring]] Czechoslovak reforms of 1968. It [[Soviet–Afghan War|invaded Afghanistan]] to support a communist government assailed by local tribal groups.&lt;ref name="Unterberger" /&gt; However, [[Marxism–Leninism]] and its theory of imperialism were also strong influences in the national emancipation movements of [[Third World]] nations rebelling against colonial or puppet regimes. In many [[Third World]] countries, communism became an ideology that united groups to oppose imperialism or colonization.

Soviet actions were [[Containment|contained]] by the United States which saw communism as a menace to its interests. Throughout the cold war, the United States created, supported, and sponsored regimes with various success that served their economic and political interests, among them [[anti-communist]] regimes such as that of [[Augusto Pinochet]] in [[Chile]] and [[Suharto]] in [[Indonesia]]. To achieve this, a variety of means was implemented, including the orchestration of coups, sponsoring of anti-communist countries and military interventions. Consequently, many self-determination movements, which spurned some type of anti-communist government, were accused of being Soviet-inspired or controlled.&lt;ref name="Unterberger" /&gt;

==== Asia ====
In Asia, the Soviet Union had already converted Mongolia into a satellite state but abandoned propping up the [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] and gave up its [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|Manchurian claims]] to China. The new [[People's Republic of China]] had gained control of mainland China in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. The [[Korean War]] shifted the focus of the Cold War from Europe to Asia, where competing superpowers took advantage of [[decolonization]] to spread their influence.

In 1947, India gained independence from the [[British Empire]]. The empire was in decline but adapted to these circumstances by creating the British Commonwealth—since 1949 the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]—which is a free association of equal states.  As India obtained its independence, multiple ethnic conflicts emerged in relation to the formation of a statehood during the [[Partition of India]] which resulted in Islamic Pakistan and Secular India. Before the [[British Raj|advent of the British]], no empire based in mainland India had controlled any part of what now makes up the country's Northeast, part of the reason for the ongoing [[insurgency in Northeast India]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apcss.org/Publications/Edited%20Volumes/ReligiousRadicalism/PagesfromReligiousRadicalismandSecurityinSouthAsiach10.pdf p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bangladesh obtained independence]] from Pakistan.

Burma also gained independence from the British Empire, but declined membership in the Commonwealth.

Indonesia gained independence from the Netherlands in 1949 after the latter failed to restore colonial control.  As mentioned above, Indonesia also wanted a powerful position in the region that could be lessened by the creation of united [[Malaysia]]. The Netherlands retained [[Dutch New Guinea]], but Indonesia threatened to invade and annex it. A vote was supposedly taken under the UN sponsored [[Act of Free Choice]] to allow West New Guineans to decide their fate, although many dispute its veracity.  Later, Portugal relinquished control over [[East Timor]] in 1975, at which time Indonesia promptly invaded and annexed it.

=== After the Cold War ===
[[File:Cold War border changes.png|thumb|upright=1.5|[[List of national border changes since World War I|Changes in national boundaries]] after the end of the Cold War]]
The Cold War began to wind down after [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] assumed power in March 1985. With the cooperation of the American president [[Ronald Reagan]], Gorbachev wound down the size of the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] and reduced nuclear arms in Europe, while liberalizing the [[economy of the Soviet Union|economy]].

In 1989 – 90, the communist regimes of Soviet satellite states collapsed in rapid succession in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Bulgaria, Romania, and Mongolia.  East and West Germany united, Czechoslovakia peacefully split into [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], while in 1990 Yugoslavia began a [[Yugoslavia#Breakup|violent break up]] into its former 6 sub-unit republics. [[Kosovo]], which was previously an autonomous unit of Serbia declared independence in 2008, but has received less international recognition.&lt;ref name="Unterberger" /&gt;

In December 1991, Gorbachev resigned as president and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved]] relatively peacefully into fifteen sovereign republics, all of which rejected communism and most of which adopted democratic reforms and free-market economies.  Inside those new republics, [[Commonwealth of Unrecognized States|four major areas]] have claimed their own independence, but not received widespread international recognition.

After decades of civil war, Indonesia finally recognized the independence of [[East Timor]] in 2002.

In 1949, the [[Communists]] won the civil war and established the [[People's Republic of China]] in Mainland China. The [[Kuomintang]]-led [[Republic of China]] government retreated to [[Taipei]], its jurisdiction now limited to [[Taiwan]] and several outlying islands. Since then, the People's Republic of China has been involved in disputes with the ROC over issues of sovereignty and the political status of Taiwan.

As noted, self-determination movements remain [[List of active autonomist and secessionist movements|strong in some areas of the world]].  Some areas possess ''de facto'' independence, such as Taiwan, [[North Cyprus]], [[Kosovo]], and [[South Ossetia]], but their independence is disputed by one or more major states. Significant movements for self-determination also persist for locations that lack ''de facto'' independence, such as [[Kurdistan]], [[Catalonia]], [[Balochistan]], [[Chechnya]], and the [[State of Palestine]]

Since the early 1990s, the legitimatization of the principle of national self-determination has led to an increase in the number of conflicts within states, as sub-groups seek greater self-determination and full secession, and as their conflicts for leadership within groups and with other groups and with the dominant state become violent.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Griffiths, [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MqLJ/2003/3.html Self-determination, International Society And World Order], [[Macquarie University]] Law Journal, 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The international reaction to these new movements has been uneven and often dictated more by politics than principle. The year 2000 United Nations Millennium Declaration failed to deal with these new demands, mentioning only "the right to self-determination of peoples which remain under colonial domination and foreign occupation. "&lt;ref name="Gudeleviciute" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf |title=United Nations Millennium Declaration, adopted by the UN General Assembly Resolution 55/2 (08 09 2000), paragraph 4. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an issue of ''[[Macquarie University]] Law Journal'' Associate Professor Aleksandar Pavkovic and Senior Lecturer Peter Radan outlined current legal and political issues in self-determination.&lt;ref name="Pavkovic"&gt;Aleksandar Pavkovic and Peter Radan, [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MqLJ/2003/1.html In Pursuit of Sovereignty and Self-determination: Peoples, States and Secession in the International Order], [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MqLJ/2003/index.html Index of papers], [[Macquarie University]] Law Journal, 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; These include:

=== Defining "peoples" ===

There is not yet a recognized legal definition of "peoples" in international law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/law/public-international-law/statehood-and-self-determination-reconciling-tradition-and-modernity-international-law] Duncan French, 2013, Statehood and Self-Determination Reconciling Tradition and Modernity in International Law, p.97&lt;/ref&gt; Vita Gudeleviciute of [[Vytautas Magnus University]] Law School, reviewing international law and UN resolutions, finds in cases of non-self-governing peoples (colonized and/or indigenous) and foreign military occupation "a people" is the entire population of the occupied territorial unit, no matter their other differences. In cases where people lack representation by a state's government, the unrepresented become a separate people. Present international law does not recognize ethnic and other minorities as separate peoples, with the notable exception of cases in which such groups are systematically disenfranchised by the government of the state they live in.&lt;ref name="Gudeleviciute" /&gt; Other definitions offered are "peoples" being self-evident (from ethnicity, language, history, etc.), or defined by "ties of mutual affection or sentiment", i.e. "loyalty", or by mutual obligations among peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pictet, Jean|title=Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949|year=1987|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|pages=52–53|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or the definition may be simply that a people is a group of individuals who unanimously choose a separate state. If the "people" are unanimous in their desire for self-determination, it strengthens their claim. For example, the populations of federal units of the Yugoslav federation were considered a people in the breakup of Yugoslavia, although some of those units had very diverse populations.&lt;ref name="Pavkovic" /&gt; Libertarians who argue for self-determination distinguish between the voluntary nation (the land, the culture, the terrain, the people) and the state, the coercive apparatus, which they have a right to choose or self-determine.&lt;ref name="Rothbard" /&gt;

Abulof suggests that self-determination entails the "moral double helix" of duality (personal right to align with a people, and the people's right to determine their politics) and mutuality (the right is as much the other's as the self’s). Thus, self-determination grants individuals the right to form "a people," which then has the right to establish an independent state, as long as they grant the same to all other individuals and peoples.&lt;ref name="Abulof"&gt;Abulof, Uriel (2015).

Criteria for the definition of "people having the right of self-determination" was proposed during 2010 Kosovo case decision of the International Court of Justice: 1. traditions and culture 2. ethnicity 3. historical ties and heritage 4. language 5. religion 6. sense of identity or kinship 7. the will to constitute a people 8. common suffering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/141/16003 United Nations, International Court of Justice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222052914/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/141/16003 |date=2017-02-22 }} 2010 Kosovo Case, Separate Opinion of Judge A.

National self-determination appears to challenge the principle of territorial integrity (or [[sovereignty]]) of states as it is the will of the people that makes a state legitimate. This implies a people should be free to choose their own state and its territorial boundaries. However, there are far more self-identified nations than there are existing states and there is no legal process to redraw state boundaries according to the will of these peoples.&lt;ref name="Pavkovic" /&gt; According to the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, the UN, ICJ and international law experts, there is no contradiction between the principles of self-determination and territorial integrity, with the latter taking precedence.

Pavkovic and Radan describe three theories of international relations relevant to self-determination.

* The realist theory of international relations insists that territorial sovereignty is more important than national self-determination. This policy was pursued by the major powers during the Cold War.
* Liberal internationalism has become an alternative since that time. It promotes the abolition of war among states as well as increased individual liberty within states, and holds the expansion of global markets and cross-border cooperation diminishes the significance of territorial integrity, allowing for somewhat greater recognition of greater self-determination of peoples.
* Cosmopolitan liberalism calls for political power to shift to a world government which would make secession and change of boundaries a relatively easy administrative matter. However, it also would mean the de facto end of self-determination of national groups.&lt;ref name="Pavkovic" /&gt;

[[File:2014-05-11. Референдум в Донецке 011.jpg|thumb|[[Donetsk and Luhansk status referendums, 2014|Donetsk status referendum]] organized by separatists in [[Ukraine]]. A line to enter a polling place, 11 May 2014]]

[[Allen Buchanan]], author of seven books on self-determination and secession, supports territorial integrity as a moral and legal aspect of constitutional democracy. However, he also advances a "Remedial Rights Only Theory" where a group has "a general right to secede if and only if it has suffered certain injustices, for which secession is the appropriate remedy of last resort. " He also would recognize secession if the state grants, or the constitution includes, a right to secede.&lt;ref name="Gudeleviciute" /&gt;

Vita Gudeleviciute holds that in cases of non-self-governing peoples and foreign military occupation the principle of self-determination trumps that of territorial integrity. In cases where people lack representation by a state's government, they also may be considered a separate people, but under current law cannot claim the right to self-determination. On the other hand, she finds that secession within a single state is a domestic matter not covered by international law. Thus there are no on what groups may constitute a seceding people.&lt;ref name="Gudeleviciute" /&gt;

A number of states have laid claim to territories, which they allege were removed from them as a result of colonialism.  This is justified by reference to Paragraph 6 of UN Resolution 1514(XV), which states that any attempt "aimed at partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter".  This, it is claimed, applies to situations where the territorial integrity of a state had been disrupted by colonisation, so that the people of a territory subject to a historic territorial claim are prevented from exercising a right to self-determination.  This interpretation is rejected by many states, who argue that Paragraph 2 of UN Resolution 1514(XV) states that "all peoples have the right to self-determination" and Paragraph 6 cannot be used to justify territorial claims.  The original purpose of Paragraph 6 was "to ensure that acts of self-determination occur within the established boundaries of colonies, rather than within sub-regions".  Further, the use of the word ''attempt'' in Paragraph 6 denotes future action and cannot be construed to justify territorial redress for past action.&lt;ref name="Musgrave2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas D.

=== Methods of increasing minority rights ===

In order to accommodate demands for minority rights and avoid secession and the creation of a separate new state, many states [[decentralization|decentralize]] or [[devolution|devolve]] greater decision-making power to new or existing subunits or [[autonomous area]]s. More limited measures might include restricting demands to the maintenance of national cultures or granting non-territorial autonomy in the form of national associations which would assume control over cultural matters. This would be available only to groups that abandoned secessionist demands and the territorial state would retain political and judicial control, but only if would remain with the territorially organized state.&lt;ref name="Pavkovic" /&gt;

=== Self-determination versus majority rule/equal rights ===

Pavković explores how national self-determination, in the form of creation of a new state through secession, could override the principles of [[majority rule]] and of [[Civil rights|equal rights]], which are primary liberal principles. This includes the question of how an unwanted state can be imposed upon a minority. He explores five contemporary theories of secession. In "anarcho-capitalist" theory only landowners have the right to secede. In communitarian theory, only those groups that desire direct or greater political participation have the right, including groups deprived of rights, per Allen Buchanan. In two nationalist theories, only national cultural groups have a right to secede. Australian professor Harry Beran's democratic theory endorses the equality of the right of secession to all types of groups. Unilateral secession against majority rule is justified if the group allows secession of any other group within its territory.&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandar Pavković, [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MqLJ/2003/5.html Majority Rule and Equal Rights: a Few Questions], [[Macquarie University]] Law Journal, 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry Beran, "A Democratic Theory of Political Self-Determination for a New World Order" in Percy Lehning (ed), Theories of Secession (1998) 36, 39, 42 – 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constitutional law ===

Most [[sovereign state]]s do not recognize the right to self-determination through secession in their constitutions. Many expressly forbid it. However, there are several existing models of self-determination through greater autonomy and through secession.&lt;ref name="Kreptul"&gt;Andrei Kreptul, [https://mises.org/journals/jls/17_4/17_4_3.pdf The Constitutional Right of Secession in Political Theory and History], [[Journal of Libertarian Studies]], [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], Volume 17, no. 4 (Fall 2003), pp. 39 – 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

In liberal constitutional democracies the principle of [[majority rule]] has dictated whether a minority can secede. In the United States [[Abraham Lincoln]] acknowledged that secession might be possible through [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amending]] the [[United States Constitution]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Texas v. White]]'' held secession could occur "through revolution, or through consent of the States."&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandar Pavković, Peter Radan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-IjHbPvp1W0C Creating New States: Theory and Practice of Secession], p. 222, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0074_0700_ZO.html ''Texas v. White''], 74 U.S. 700 (1868) at [[Cornell University Law School]] Supreme Court collection.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] in 1933 held that [[Western Australia]] only could secede from Australia upon vote of a majority of the country as a whole; the previous two-thirds majority vote for secession via referendum in Western Australia was insufficient.&lt;ref name="Pavkovic" /&gt;

The [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] followed the Soviet Union in including the right of secession in its 1931 constitution in order to entice ethnic nationalities and Tibet into joining. However, the Party eliminated the right to secession in later years, and had anti-secession clause written into the Constitution before and after the founding the People's Republic of China. The 1947 Constitution of the [[Burma|Union of Burma]] contained an express state right to secede from the union under a number of procedural conditions. It was eliminated in the 1974 constitution of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma (officially the "Union of Myanmar"). Burma still allows "local autonomy under central leadership".&lt;ref name="Kreptul" /&gt;

As of 1996 the constitutions of Austria, Ethiopia, France, and [[Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Saint Kitts and Nevis]] have express or implied rights to secession. Switzerland allows for the secession from current and the creation of new [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]]. In the case of proposed [[Quebec]] separation from Canada the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in 1998 ruled that only both a clear majority of the province and a constitutional amendment confirmed by all participants in the Canadian federation could allow secession.&lt;ref name="Kreptul" /&gt;

The 2003 draft of the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Union Constitution]] allowed for the voluntary withdrawal of member states from the union, although the State wanted to leave could not be involved in the vote deciding whether or not they can leave the Union.&lt;ref name="Kreptul" /&gt; There was much discussion about such self-determination by minorities&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon Contiades, [http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/AUD/s6.htm Sixth Scholarly Panel: Cultural Identity in the New Europe], 1st Global Conference on Federalism and the Union of European Democracies, March 2004. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105214649/http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/AUD/s6.htm |date=January 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before the final document underwent the unsuccessful ratification process in 2005.

As a result of the successful [[Liechtenstein constitutional referendum, 2003|constitutional referendum]] held in 2003, every municipality in the [[Liechtenstein|Principality of Liechtenstein]] has the right to secede from the Principality by a vote of a majority of the citizens residing in this municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fuerstenhaus.li/en/monarchy/the-reform-of-the-constitution-in-2003/|title=The Reform of the Constitution in 2003|website=www.fuerstenhaus.li|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drawing new borders ===

In determining international borders between sovereign states, self-determination has yielded to a number of other principles.&lt;ref name="Anstis"&gt;Sebastian Anstis, [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09592296.2010.482477 The Normative Bases of the Global Territorial Order], [[Diplomacy &amp; Statecraft]], Volume 21, no. 2 (June 2010), pp. 306 – 323.&lt;/ref&gt; Once groups exercise self-determination through secession, the issue of the proposed borders may prove more controversial than the fact of secession. The bloody Yugoslav wars in the 1990s were related mostly to border issues because the international community applied a version of [[uti possidetis juris]] in transforming the existing internal borders of the various Yugoslav republics into international borders, despite the conflicts of ethnic groups within those boundaries. In the 1990s indigenous populations of the northern two-thirds of Quebec province opposed being incorporated into a Quebec nation and stated a determination to resist it by force.&lt;ref name="Pavkovic" /&gt;

The border between [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Irish Free State]] was based on the borders of existing counties and did not include all of historic [[Ulster]].  A [[Irish Boundary Commission|Boundary Commission]] was established to consider re-drawing it. Its proposals, which amounted to a small net transfer to Northern Ireland, were leaked to the press and then not acted upon. In December 1925, the governments of the Irish Free State, Northern Ireland, and the United Kingdom agreed to accept the existing border.

It successfully defended its independence in subsequent [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|war with Azerbaijan]], but remains largely unrecognized by UN states today.

=== Australia ===
{{Main|Self-determination of Australian Aborigines}}

From 2003 onwards, self-determination has become the topic of some debate in Australia in relation to [[Aboriginal Australians]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders]]. In the 1970s, the Indigenous community approached the Federal Government and requested the right to administer their own communities. This encompassed basic local government functions, ranging from land dealings and management of community centres to road maintenance and garbage collection, as well as setting education programmes and standards in their local schools.

===Azawad===
{{Main|Northern Mali conflict}}

The traditional homeland of the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] peoples was divided up by the modern borders of [[Mali]], [[Algeria]] and [[Niger]]. Numerous rebellions occurred over the decades, but in 2012 the Tuaregs succeeded in occupying their land and declaring the independence of [[Azawad]]. However, their movement was hijacked by the Islamist terrorist group [[Ansar Dine]].

It comprises the autonomous communities of the Basque Country and [[Navarre]] in Spain and the [[Northern Basque Country]] in France.
Since the 19th century, [[Basque nationalism]] has demanded the right of some kind of self-determination. {{citation needed|date=January 2008}} This desire for independence is particularly stressed among [[left-wing politics|leftist]] Basque nationalists. The right of self-determination was asserted by the [[Basque Parliament]] in 1990, 2002 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eitb24.com/portal/eitb24/noticia/en/politics/pp-and-pse-voted-against-basque-parliament-adopts-resolution-on-s?itemId=B24_18787&amp;cl=%2Feitb24%2Fpolitica&amp;idioma=en |title=EITB: ''Basque parliament adopts resolution on self-determination'' |publisher=Eitb24.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The derived autonomous regime for the BAC was approved by Spanish Parliament and also by the Basque citizens in referendum. The autonomous statue of Navarre (''Amejoramiento del Fuero'': "improvement of the charter") was approved by the Spanish Parliament and, like the statues of 13 out 17 Spanish autonomous communities, it didn´t need a referendum to enter into force.&lt;!-- There are not many sources on the issue for the French Basque country. --&gt;

From 1999 to the present day, the indigenous people of Biafra have been agitating for independence to revive their country. They have registered a human rights organization known as Bilie Human Rights Initiative both in Nigeria and in the United Nations to advocate for their right to self-determination and achieve independence by the rule of law.&lt;ref name="BBCprofile"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13949550 | title=Nigeria profile | work=BBC Africa | date=May 1, 2012 | accessdate=May 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[2012 Catalan march for independence]], in which between 600,000 and 1.5 million citizens marched,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalunya clama por la independencia|url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/diada-2012/20120911/manifestacion-diada-en-barcelona-2202293|website=ElPeriodico|publisher=El Periodico|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[President of the Generalitat of Catalonia|President of Catalonia]], [[Artur Mas]], called for new [[Catalonian parliamentary election, 2012|parliamentary elections on 25 November 2012]] to elect a new [[Parliament of Catalonia|parliament]] that would exercise the right of self-determination for Catalonia, a right not recognised under the Spanish constitution. The Parliament of Catalonia voted to hold a votee in the next four-year legislature on the question of self-determination. The parliamentary decision was approved by a large majority of MPs: 84 voted for, 21 voted against, and 25 abstained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two thirds of the Catalan Parliament approve organising a self-determination citizen vote within the next 4 years |url=http://www.catalannewsagency.com/news/politics/two-thirds-catalan-parliament-approve-organising-self-determination-citizen-vote-withi |publisher=Catalan News Agency |date=28 September 2013 |accessdate=29 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001020028/http://www.catalannewsagency.com/news/politics/two-thirds-catalan-parliament-approve-organising-self-determination-citizen-vote-withi |archivedate=October 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catalan Parliament applied to the Spanish Parliament for the power to call a referendum to be devolved, but this was turned down. In December 2013 the President of the Generalitat Artur Mas and the governing coalition agreed to set the referendum for self-determination on 9 November 2014, and legislation specifically saying that the consultation would not be a "referendum" was enacted, only to be blocked by the Spanish Constitutional Court, at the request of the Spanish government. Given the block, the Government turned it into a simple "consultation to the people" instead.

The question in the consultation was "Do you want Catalonia to be a State?" and, if the answer to this question was yes, "Do you want this State to be an independent State?". However, as the consultation was not a formal referendum, these (printed) answers were just suggestions and other answers were also accepted and catalogued as "other answers" instead as null votes. The turnout in this consultation was about 2·3m people out of 6·2m people that were called to vote (this figure does not coincide with the census figure of 5·3m for two main reasons: first, because organisers had no access to an official census due to the non-binding character of the consultation, and second, because the legal voting age was set to 16 rather than 18). Due to the lack of an official census, potential voters were assigned to electoral tables according to home address and first family name. Participants had to sign up first with their full name and national ID in a voter registry before casting their ballot, which prevented participants from potentially casting multiple ballots. The overall result was 80·76% in favor of both questions, 11% in favor of the first question but not of the second questions, 4·54% against both; the rest were classified as "other answers". The voter turnout was around 37% (most people against the consultation didn't go to vote). Four top members of Catalonia's political leadership were barred from public office for having defied the Constitutional court's last-minute ban.

Almost three years later (1 October 2017), the Catalan government called a referendum for independence under legislation adopted in September 2017 (despite being blocked by the Constitutional Court of Spain), with the question "Do you want Catalonia to become an independent state in the form of a Republic?". On polling day, the Catalan police prevented voting in over 500 polling stations, without incident, while the Spanish police confiscated ballot boxes and closed down 92,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Els Mossos van tancar 600 col·legis electorals; la policia espanyola i la Guàrdia Civil, 92 |url=https://www.rac1.cat/info-rac1/20171005/431811387579/els-mossos-van-tancar-600-collegis-electorals-la-policia-espanyola-i-la-guardia-civil-92.html |publisher=RAC1 |date=6 October 2017 |accessdate=22 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with several incidents involving truncheon charges, the closure of some voting centres and the seizure of ballot boxes. The opposition parties had called for non-participation. The turnout (according to the votes that were counted) was 2·3m out of 5·3m (43·03% of the census), and 90·18% of the ballots were in favour of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Govern trasllada els resultats definitius del referèndum de l'1 d'octubre al Parlament de Catalunya |url=http://premsa.gencat.cat/pres_fsvp/AppJava/notapremsavw/303541/ca/govern-trasllada-resultats-definitius-referendum-l1-doctubre-parlament-catalunya.do |publisher=Catalan News Agency |date=6 October 2017 |accessdate=22 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The turnout, ballot count and results were similar to those of the 2014 "consultation".

Under [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]], Chechnya declared independence as the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]], using self-determination, Russia's history of bad treatment of Chechens, and a history of independence before invasion by Russia as main motives. Russia has restored control over Chechnya, but the separatist government functions still in exile, though it has been split into two entities: the [[Akhmed Zakayev]]-run secular Chechen Republic (based in Poland, the UK and the US), and the Islamic [[Caucasus Emirate]].

There is an active secessionist movement based on the self-determination of the residents of the [[Donetsk Oblast|Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk Oblast|Luhansk]] regions of eastern [[Ukraine]], allegedly against the instability and corruption of the Ukrainian government. However, many in the international community assert that [[Donbass status referendums, 2014|referendums held there in 2014]] regarding independence from Ukraine were illegitimate and undemocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Canada Rejects Illegitimate Referendums in Eastern Ukraine|url = http://www.international.gc.ca/media/aff/news-communiques/2014/05/11b.aspx?lang=eng|accessdate = 2015-10-09|first = Foreign Affairs Trade and Development Canada|last = Government of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=EU@UN - EU Council conclusions on Ukraine |url=http://eu-un.europa.eu/articles/en/article_15004_en.htm |website=eu-un.europa.eu |accessdate=2015-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016041020/http://eu-un.europa.eu/articles/en/article_15004_en.htm |archivedate=2015-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there are reports that [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2014|presidential elections in May 2014]] were prevented from taking place in the two regions after armed gunmen took control of polling stations, kidnapped election officials, and stole lists of electors, thus denying the population the chance to express their will in a free, fair, and internationally recognised election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Trepidation, intimidation in eastern Ukraine as Sunday’s election nears|url = http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/5/23/intimidation-easternukrainevote.html|website = america.aljazeera.com|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also arguments, that the de facto separation of Eastern Ukraine from the rest of the country is not in fact an expression of self-determination, but rather an invasion by neighbouring [[Russia]], with Ukrainian President [[Petro Poroshenko]] reporting to MPs on the 4th June 2015 that up to nine thousand Russian soldiers were deployed in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ukraine's Poroshenko warns of 'full-scale' Russia invasion - BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33003237|website = BBC News|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have pointed out that Russian troops did not invade, as they were already stationed in Crimea as part of a basing agreement, and that the secessionist movements arose in response to the overthrow of the elected president of Ukraine.

International Affairs, Vol 44 (1968), pp. 463–481."Much is made in successive presentations of the Argentine case of the next episode in the history of the islands: the supposed fact that Great Britain 'brutally' and 'forcefully' expelled the Argentine garrison in 1833. The record is not nearly so dramatic. After the commander of the Lexington had declared, in December 1831, the Falklands 'free of all government', they remained without any visible authority. However, in September 1832, the Buenos Aires Government appointed, in place of Vernet, an interim commandant, Juan Mestivier. The British representative immediately lodged a protest, but Mes- tivier sailed on the Sarandi at the end of the year to take charge of a penal settlement at San Carlos, his Government's reserve on East Falkland. There was a mutiny, led by a sergeant of the garrison, and Mestivier was murdered. At this juncture, on January 11, 1833, H.M. sloop Clio arrived at Puerto de la Soledad when Pinedo, the commander of the Sarandi and 25 soldiers were attempting to re-establish order. The so called 'brutal' eviction is laconically recorded in Captain Onslow's log: Tuesday 1 Jany. 1833. P.M. Mod. with rain 12.20 shortened sails and came to Port Louis (Soledad), Berkeley Sound ... found here a Buenos Ayrean flag flying on shore. 2.30 out boats. 3 furled sails. 5.30 Moored ship . . .

Mod. cloudy ... loosed sails and landed a party of marines and seamen and hoisted the Union Jack and hauled down the Buenos Ayrean flag and sent it on board the schooner to the Commandante. Sailmaker repairing the Main top Gallant sails.... In the interval between these two entries, Onslow had 'civilly' (his report) told Pinedo that he had come 'to exercise the right of sovereignty' on the islands and asked him to haul down his flag on shore. Pinedo protested, but said that if the Buenos Aires flag were allowed to fly until January 5, he would leave with his soldiers and anyone else who wished to go. When Onslow proved adamant, Pinedo agreed to embark his soldiers, but he left his flag flying on shore. This was why Onslow sent it to him by one of the Clio's officers. Pinedo sailed on January 4 and was later punished by the Buenos Aires Government for failing to offer any resistance"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurio Hedelvio Destéfani|title=The Malvinas, the South Georgias, and the South Sandwich Islands, the conflict with Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sGAJSfxqd7oC|year=1982|publisher=Edipress|isbn=978-950-01-6904-2|page=91|quote=Before Pinedo sailed from the Malvinas he appointed Political and Military Commander of the Islands, a Frenchman name Juan Simon who had been Vernet's trusted foreman in charge of his gauchos}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there was no attempt to colonise the islands until 1841.&lt;ref name="Harper1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marjory Harper|title=Emigration from Scotland Between the Wars: Opportunity Or Exile?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L4x2UdzPB4cC&amp;pg=PA91|year=1998|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4927-9|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hong Kong ===
{{Main|Hong Kong independence}}
Before the United Nations's adoption of resolution 2908 (XXVII) on 2 November 1972, The People's Republic of China vetoed the former British colony of Hong Kong's right to self-determination on 8 March 1972. This sparked several nation's protest along with Great Britain's declaration on 14 December that the decision is invalid. [[File:AdmiraltyUmbrellaRevolution90.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|A street sign during the 2014 Hong Kong Protests for Democracy.]]
Decades later, a nationalist independence movement, dubbed as the Hong Kong independence&amp;nbsp;movement emerged in the now Communist Chinese controlled territory. It advocates the autonomous region to become a fully independent sovereign state.

The city is considered a [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative region]]&amp;nbsp;(SAR) which, according to the PRC, enjoys a high degree of autonomy under the People's Republic of China (PRC), guaranteed under Article 2 of&amp;nbsp;[[Hong Kong Basic Law]]&lt;sup&gt;[[Hong Kong independence#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;(which is ratified under the&amp;nbsp;[[Sino-British Joint Declaration]]), since the&amp;nbsp;[[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong]]&amp;nbsp;from the United Kingdom to the PRC in 1997. Since the handover, many Hongkongers are increasingly concerned about Beijing's growing encroachment on the territory's freedoms and the failure of the Hong Kong government to deliver 'true' democracy.&lt;sup&gt;[[Hong Kong independence#cite note-rally-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

The&amp;nbsp;[[2014–15 Hong Kong electoral reform]]&amp;nbsp;package deeply divided the city, as it allowed Hongkongers to have universal suffrage, but Beijing would have authority to screen the candidates to restrict the electoral method for the&amp;nbsp;[[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]]&amp;nbsp;(CE), the highest-ranking official of the territory. This sparked the 79-day massive peaceful protests which was dubbed as the "[[Umbrella Revolution]]" and the pro-independence movement emerged on the Hong Kong political scene.&lt;sup&gt;[[Hong Kong independence#cite note-rally-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;

Since then, [[Localism in Hong Kong|localism]] has gained momentum, particularly after the failure of the peaceful [[Umbrella Movement]].  Young localist leaders have led numerous protest actions against pro-Chinese policies to raise awareness of social problems of Hong Kong under Chinese rule. These include the sit-in protest against the [[Copyright (Amendment) Bill 2014|Bill to Strengthen Internet Censorship]], demonstrations against [[University of Hong Kong pro-vice-chancellor selection controversy|Chinese political interference in the University of Hong Kong]], the [[2015 Yuen Long protest|Recover Yuen Long]] protests and the [[2016 Mong Kok civil unrest]]. According to a survey conducted by the&amp;nbsp;[[Chinese University of Hong Kong]]&amp;nbsp;(CUHK) in July 2016, 17.4% of respondents supported the city becoming an independent entity after 2047, while 3.6% stated that it is "possible".&lt;sup&gt;[[Hong Kong independence#cite note-3|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Kashmir ===
{{Main|Kashmir conflict}}
Ever since Pakistan and India’s inception in 1947 the legal state of Jammu and Kashmir, the land between India and Pakistan, has been contested as Britain was resigning from their rule over this land. Maharaja Hari Singh, the ruler residing over Kashmir at the time accession, signed the Instrument of Accession Act on October 26, 1947 as his territory was being attacked by Pakistani tribesmen. The passing of this Act allowed Jammu and Kashmir to accede to India on legal terms. When this Act was taken to Lord Mountbatten, the last viceroy of British India, he agreed to it and stated that a referendum needed to be held by the citizens in India, Pakistan, and Kashmir so that they could vote as to where Kashmir should accede to. This referendum that Mountbatten called for never took place and framed one of the legal disputes for Kashmir. In 1948 the United Nations intervened and ordered a plebiscite to be taken in order to hear the voices of the Kashmiris if they would like to accede to Pakistan or India. This plebiscite left out the right for Kashmiris to have the right of self-determination and become an autonomous state. To this date the Kashmiris have been faced with numerous human rights violations committed by both India and Pakistan and have yet to gain complete autonomy which they have been seeking through self-determination.{{POV check inline|This whole paragraph is the only edit by a new user on a contentious topic, so I suspect NPOV issues.|date=September 2018}} {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable sources needed for the entire paragraph.|date=April 2018}}

The insurgency in Kashmir against Indian rule has existed in various forms. A widespread armed insurgency started in Kashmir against India rule in 1989 after allegations of rigging by the Indian government in the 1987 Jammu and Kashmir state election. This led to some parties in the state assembly forming militant wings, which acted as a catalyst for the emergence of armed insurgency in the region. The conflict over Kashmir has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.
[[File:Indian soldiers, Kashmir (8138898130).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Indian soldiers on the streets of Kashmir during the [[Kashmir conflict|2016 unrests]].]]
The Inter-Services Intelligence of Pakistan has been accused by India of supporting and training both pro-Pakistan and pro-independence militants to fight Indian security forces in Jammu and Kashmir, a charge that Pakistan denies. According to official figures released in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly, there were 3,400 disappearance cases and the conflict has left more than 47,000 to 100,000 people dead as of July 2009. However, violence in the state had fallen sharply after the start of a slow-moving peace process between India and Pakistan. After the peace process failed in 2008, mass demonstrations against Indian rule, and also low-scale militancy have emerged again.

However, despite boycott calls by separatist leaders in 2014, the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections saw highest voters turnout in last 25 years since insurgency erupted. As per the Indian government, it recorded more than 65% of voters turnout which was more than usual voters turnout in other state assembly elections of India. It considered as increase in faith of Kashmiri people in democratic process of India. However, activists say that the voter turnout is highly exaggerated and that elections are held under duress. Votes are cast because the people want stable governance of the state, and this cannot be mistaken as an endorsement of Indian rule.

[[Kurdistan]] is a historical region primarily inhabited by the [[Kurdish people]] of the middle east. The territory is currently part of 4 states Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran. There are Kurdish self-determination movements in each of the 4 states. Iraqi Kurdistan has to date achieved the largest degree of self-determination through the formation of the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]], an entity recognised by the Iraqi Federal Constitution.

Although the right of the creation of a Kurdish state was recognized following World War I in the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], the treaty was then annulled by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]]. To date two separate Kurdish republics and one Kurdish Kingdom have declared sovereignty. The [[Republic of Ararat]] ([[Ağrı Province]], Turkey), the [[Republic of Mehabad]] ([[West Azerbaijan Province]], Iran) and the [[Kingdom of Kurdistan]] ([[Sulaymaniyah Province]], [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], Iraq), each of these fledgling states was crushed by military intervention. The [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]] which currently holds the [[President of Iraq|Iraqi presidency]] and the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party]] which governs the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] both explicitly commit themselves to the development of Kurdish self-determination, but opinions vary as to the question of self-determination sought within the current borders and countries.

=== Nagalim ===
{{Main|Naga nationalism}}

[[Naga people|Naga]] refers to a vaguely-defined conglomeration of distinct tribes living on the border of India and Burma. Each of these tribes lived in a sovereign village before the arrival of the [[British India|British]], but developed a common identity as the area was Christianized. After the British left India, a section of Nagas under the leadership of [[Angami Zapu Phizo]] sought to establish a separate country for the Nagas. Phizo's group, the [[Naga National Council]] (NNC), claimed that 99. 9% of the Nagas wanted an independent Naga country according to a referendum conducted by it. It waged a secessionist insurgency against the Government of India. The NNC collapsed after Phizo got his dissenters killed or forced them to seek refuge with the Government.&lt;ref name="SK_Chaube_Naga_Politics"&gt;{{cite book | last = Chaube | first = Shibani Kinkar | title = Hill politics in Northeast India | publisher = Orient Longman | origyear = 1973 | year = 1999 | oclc = 42913576 | isbn = 81-250-1695-3 | pages = 153–161 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ranabir_Samaddar"&gt;{{cite book | last = Samaddar | first = Ranabir | title = The Politics of Dialogue: Living Under the Geopolitical Histories of War and Peace | publisher = Ashgate | year = 2004 | oclc = 56466278 | isbn = 978-0-7546-3607-6 | pages = 171–173 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phizo escaped to London, while NNC's successor secessionist groups continued to stage violent attacks against the Indian Government. The Naga People's Convention (NPC), another major Naga organization, was opposed to the secessionists. Its efforts led to the creation of a separate Nagaland state within India in 1963.&lt;ref name="Hamlet2001"&gt;{{cite book | author=Hamlet Bareh | title=Encyclopaedia of North-East India: Nagaland | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b9-Ie-Vp6NoC&amp;pg=PA78 | year=2001 | publisher=Mittal Publications | isbn=978-81-7099-793-1 | pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The secessionist violence declined considerably after the [[Shillong Accord of 1975]]. However, three factions of the [[National Socialist Council of Nagaland]] (NSCN) continue to seek an independent country which would include parts of India and Burma. They envisage a sovereign, predominantly Christian nation called "Nagalim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Dr. Kunal Ghosh | title=Separatism in North East India: Role of Religion, Language and Script | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_8ylAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT85 | date=1 January 2008 | publisher=Suruchi Prakashan | isbn=978-81-89622-33-6 | page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North Borneo and Sarawak ===

Another controversial episode with perhaps more relevance was the British beginning their exit from [[British Malaya]]. An experience concerned the findings of a ''United Nations Assessment Team'' that led the British territories of [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]] and [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]] in 1963 to determine whether or not the populations wished to become a part of the new Malaysia Federation.&lt;ref name="am001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://untreaty.un.org/unts/1_60000/21/36/00041791.pdf |title=United Nations Treaty Series Nr. 10760: Agreement relating to Malaysia |accessdate=2010-07-29 |publisher=United Nations |work=United Nations Treaty Collection |format=PDF |date=July 1963 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514204944/http://untreaty.un.org/unts/1_60000/21/36/00041791.pdf |archivedate=May 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nation Team's mission followed on from an earlier assessment by the British-appointed [[Cobbold Commission]] which had arrived in the territories in 1962 and held hearings to determine public opinion. It also sifted through 1600 letters and memoranda submitted by individuals, organisations and political parties. Cobbold concluded that around two thirds of the population favoured to the formation of Malaysia while the remaining third wanted either independence or continuing control by the United Kingdom. The United Nations team largely confirmed these findings, which were later accepted by the General Assembly, and both territories subsequently wish to form the new Federation of [[Malaysia]]. The conclusions of both the Cobbold Commission and the United Nations team were arrived at without any [[referendums]] self-determination being held.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unyearbook.un.org/1960YUN/1960_P1_SEC3_CH4.pdf |title=United Nations General Assembly 15th Session - The Trusteeship System and Non-Self-Governing Territories (pages: 509-510) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121100604/http://unyearbook.un.org/1960YUN/1960_P1_SEC3_CH4.pdf |archivedate=January 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unyearbook.un.org/1963YUN/1963_P1_SEC1_CH3.pdf |title=United Nations General Assembly 18th Session - the Question of Malaysia (pages: 41-44) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111232635/http://unyearbook.un.org/1963YUN/1963_P1_SEC1_CH3.pdf |archivedate=November 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Singaporean national referendum, 1962|Unlike in Singapore]], however, no [[referendum]] was ever conducted in [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]] and [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey Kitingan]]: [https://web.archive.org/web/20130310053153/http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2013/03/08/there-was-no-sabah-referendum/ There was no Sabah referendum], published by [[Free Malaysia Today]], March 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; they sought to consolidate several of the previous ruled entities then there was [[Manila Accord]], an agreement between the Philippines, [[Federation of Malaya]] and Indonesia on 31 July 1963&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20550/volume-550-I-8029-English.pdf|title=United Nations Treaty Registered No. 8029, Manila Accord between Philippines, Federation of Malaya and Indonesia (31 JULY 1963)|publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20608/volume-608-I-8809-English.pdf|title=United Nations Treaty Series No. 8809, Agreement relating to the implementation of the Manila Accord|publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; to abide by the wishes of the people of [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]] and [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]] within the context of [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1541 (XV)]], Principle 9 of the Annex&lt;ref&gt;[http://unyearbook.un.org/1960YUN/1960_P1_SEC3_CH4.pdf General Assembly 15th Session – The Trusteeship System and Non-Self-Governing Territories (pages: 509 – 510)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320074502/http://unyearbook.un.org/1960YUN/1960_P1_SEC3_CH4.pdf |date=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unyearbook.un.org/1963YUN/1963_P1_SEC1_CH3.pdf General Assembly 18th Session – the Question of Malaysia (pages: 41 – 44)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029214700/http://unyearbook.un.org/1963YUN/1963_P1_SEC1_CH3.pdf |date=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; taking into account [[referendum]]s in North Borneo and Sarawak that would be free and without coercion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20550/volume-550-I-8029-English.pdf |title=United Nations Treaty Registered No. 8029, Manila Accord between Philippines, Federation of Malaya and Indonesia (31 JULY 1963) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also triggered the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|Indonesian confrontation]] because Indonesia opposed the violation of the agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/decolonization/nonselfgov.shtml |title=United Nations list of Trust and Non-Self-Governing Territories, North Borneo and Sarawak |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2006/org1469.doc.htm |title=United Nations Member States |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Northern Cyprus ===
{{Main|Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus}}
[[File:Pro-TRNC demonstration in Sarayönü North Nicosia.jpg|thumb|[[Sarayönü Square|Atatürk Square]], North Nicosia in 2006, with the [[Northern Cyprus]] and [[Turkey|Turkish]] flags.]]
Cyprus was settled by Mycenaean Greeks in two waves in the 2nd millennium BC. As a strategic location in the Middle East, it was subsequently occupied by several major powers, including the empires of the Assyrians, Egyptians and Persians, from whom the island was seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great. Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic Egypt, the Classical and Eastern Roman Empire, Arab caliphates for a short period and the French Lusignan dynasty. Following the death in 1473 of James II, the last Lusignan king, the Republic of Venice assumed control of the island, while the late king's Venetian widow, Queen Catherine Cornaro, reigned as figurehead. Venice formally annexed the Kingdom of Cyprus in 1489, following the abdication of Catherine. The Venetians fortified Nicosia by building the Walls of Nicosia, and used it as an important commercial hub.

Although the Lusignan French aristocracy remained the dominant social class in Cyprus throughout the medieval period, the former assumption that Greeks were treated only as serfs on the island is no longer considered by academics to be accurate. It is now accepted that the medieval period saw increasing numbers of Greek Cypriots elevated to the upper classes, a growing Greek middle ranks, and the Lusignan royal household even marrying Greeks. This included King John II of Cyprus who married Helena Palaiologina.

Throughout Venetian rule, the Ottoman Empire frequently raided Cyprus. In 1539 the Ottomans destroyed Limassol and so fearing the worst, the Venetians also fortified Famagusta and Kyrenia.

Invaded in 1570, Turks controlled and solely governed all of the Cyprus island from 1571 till its leasing to the United Kingdom in 1878. Cyprus was placed under British administration based on Cyprus Convention in 1878 and formally annexed by Britain in 1914. While Turkish Cypriots made up 18% of the population, the partition of Cyprus and creation of a Turkish state in the north became a policy of Turkish Cypriot leaders and Turkey in the 1950s.  Politically, there was no majority/minority relation between [[Greek Cypriots]] and [[Turkish Cypriots]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesis.bilkent.edu.tr/0001608.pdf Behice Ozlem Gokakin, MS Thesis, Bilkent Univ., 2001] p.36, Vassiliou (the Council of Europe, 30.01.1990; to the question of Keith Speed (Member of the UK Parliament)): "the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities are political equals."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecmi.de/fileadmin/downloads/publications/JEMIE/2004/1-2004Chapter2.pdf Nathalie Tocci and Tamara Kovziridze, Cyprus] p.14: In July 1989, UN SG Perez de Cuellar stated "Cyprus is a common home for the Greek and Turkish communities, whose relationship would be not of majority and minority but rather of political equality"&lt;/ref&gt; and hence, in 1960, [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]] was founded by the constituent communities in Cyprus (Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots)&lt;ref&gt;James R.

The case of Cyprus is sui generis, for there is no other State in the world which came into being as a result of two politically equal peoples coming together by the exercise by each of its sovereign right of self-determination, to create a unique legal relationship, which was in turn guaranteed by international treaty, to which each of them consented. From its very inception the Republic of Cyprus was never a unitary state in which there is only one electorate with a majority and minority. The two communities were political equals and each existed as a political entity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ataa.org/reference/pdf/Cristv.Turkey.pdf Saltzman and Evinch and Perles Law Firm] The Republic of Cyprus was founded in 1960 as a bicommunal state in which the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities had the status of co-founders and equal partners.&lt;/ref&gt; During 1963-74, the island experienced ethnic clashes and turmoil, the coup to unify the island to Greece and eventual Turkish operation in 1974.

The colonization of the North American continent and its [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] population has been the source of legal battles since the early 19th century. Many Native American tribes were resettled onto separate tracts of land ([[Indian reservation|reservations]]), which have retained a certain degree of [[autonomy]] within the United States.  The federal government recognizes [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|Tribal Sovereignty]] and has established a number of laws attempting to clarify the relationship among the federal, state, and tribal governments. The Constitution and later federal laws recognize the local sovereignty of tribal nations, but do not recognize full sovereignty equivalent to that of foreign nations, hence the term "domestic dependent nations" to qualify the federally recognized tribes.

Certain [[Chicano nationalism|Chicano nationalist]] groups seek to "recreate" an ethnic-based state to be called [[Aztlán]], after the legendary homeland of the [[Aztec]]s. It would comprise the [[Southwestern United States]], historic territory of indigenous peoples and their descendants, as well as colonists and later settlers under the Spanish colonial and Mexican governments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aztlan.net/homeland.htm Professor Predicts 'Hispanic Homeland'], Associated Press, 2000 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107032413/http://www.aztlan.net/homeland.htm |date=November 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black nationalists]] have argued that, by virtue of slaves' unpaid labor and the harsh experiences of African Americans under slavery and [[Jim Crow]], African Americans have a moral claim to the [[Black Belt (U.S. region)|black belt]] region of the [[American South]]. They believe this area should be the basis of forming an independent state of [[New Afrika]], designed to have an African-American majority and political control.

There are several active Hawaiian autonomy or independence movements, each with the goal of realizing some level of political control over single or several islands. The groups range from those seeking territorial units similar to Indian reservations under the United States, with the least amount of independent control, to the [[Hawaiian sovereignty movement]], which is projected to have the most amount of independence. The Hawaiian Sovereignty movement seeks to revive the Hawaiian nation under the Hawaiian constitution. Supporters of this concept say that Hawaii [http://www2.hawaii.edu/~anu/pdf/Dissertation(Sai).pdf retained its sovereignty] while under control of the United States.

Since 1972, the U.N. Decolonization Committee has called for [[Puerto Rico]]'s "decolonization" and for the US to recognize the island's right to self-determination and independence. In 2007 the Decolonization Subcommittee called for the United Nations General Assembly to review the political status of Puerto Rico, a power reserved by the 1953 Resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/gacol3160.doc.htm |title=Special Committee on Decolonization Calls on United States to Expedite Puerto Rico’s Self-determination Process – General Assembly GA/COL/3160 – Department of Public Information – June 14, 2007 |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed the 1967 passage of a [[plebiscite]] act that provided for a vote on the status of Puerto Rico with three status options: continued commonwealth, statehood, and independence. In the first plebscite, the commonwealth option won with 60.4% of the votes, but US congressional committees failed to enact legislation to address the status issue. In subsequent plebiscites in 1993 and 1998, the status quo was favored.&lt;ref&gt;For complete statistics of these plebiscites, see [http://electionspuertorico.org/cgi-bin/events.cgi Elections in Puerto Rico: Results].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Puerto Rican status referendum, 2012|referendum]] that took place in November 2012, a majority of Puerto Rican residents voted to change the territory's relationship with the United States, with the statehood option being the preferred option. But a large number of ballots—one-third of all votes cast—were left blank on the question of preferred alternative status. Supporters of the commonwealth status had urged voters to blank their ballots. When the blank votes are counted as anti-statehood votes, the statehood option would have received less than 50% of all ballots received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/07/politics/election-puerto-rico/index.html|title=Puerto Ricans favor statehood for the first time|work=[[CNN]]|author=Castillo, Mariano|date=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2014, Washington has not taken action to address the results of this plebiscite.

Many current US [[Secession in the United States|state, regional and city secession groups]] use the language of self-determination. A 2008 [[Zogby International]] poll revealed that 22% of Americans believe that "any state or region has the right to peaceably secede and become an independent republic."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.dbm?ID=1531 Middlebury Institute/Zogby Poll: "One in Five Americans Believe States Have the Right to Secede"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814090142/http://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.dbm?ID=1531 |date=2008-08-14 }}, [http://zogby.com/ Zogby International], July 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Mayer, [http://www.stltoday.com/blogzone/the-platform/editorial-writers-notebooks/2008/07/secession-still-a-popular-idea/ "Secession: still a popular idea?"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080804015722/http://www.stltoday.com/blogzone/the-platform/editorial-writers-notebooks/2008/07/secession-still-a-popular-idea/ |date=2008-08-04 }}, ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]],'' July 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 20th century, some states periodically discuss desires to secede from the United States. Unilateral secession was ruled unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court in ''[[Texas v. White]]'' (1869).

In the case of Hawaii, the struggle for self-determination does not fall under secession, as it is less a break from federal administration, than a return to the process through which cession was claimed to have occurred: namely the ongoing occupation via a US imposed military coup; and/or removal from the UN list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter11.shtml|title=Charter of the United Nations|author=|date=|work=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; to educate or properly inform the citizenry of Hawaii of its options for self-determination and sidestepped guidelines laid out in UN General Assembly resolution 742 (1953).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statehoodhawaii.org/2009/05/12/the-statehood-plebiscite/|title=The Statehood Plebiscite|author=|date=|work=statehoodhawaii.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006174252/http://statehoodhawaii.org/2009/05/12/the-statehood-plebiscite/|archivedate=2014-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Papua===
{{Main|Papua conflict}}

The self-determination of the [[West Papua (region)|West Papuan]] people has been violently suppressed by the [[Indonesia|Indonesian government]] since the withdrawal of Dutch colonial rule under the [[Netherlands New Guinea]] in 1962.

'''Tammany Hall''', also known as the '''Society of St. Tammany''', the '''Sons of St. Tammany''', or the '''Columbian Order''', was a New York City political organization founded in 1786 and incorporated on May 12, 1789, as the '''Tammany Society'''.  It was the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] [[political machine]] that played a major role in controlling [[History of New York City|New York City]] and [[New York State]] politics and helping immigrants, most notably the Irish, rise up in American politics from the 1790s to the 1960s. It typically controlled Democratic Party nominations and [[political patronage]] in [[Manhattan]] from the mayoral victory of [[Fernando Wood]] in 1854 and used its patronage resources to build a loyal, well-rewarded core of district and precinct leaders; after 1850 the great majority were [[Irish Catholic]]s.

The Tammany Society emerged as the center for [[Democratic-Republican Party]] politics in the city in the early 19th century.  After 1854, the Society expanded its political control even further by earning the loyalty of the city's rapidly expanding immigrant community, which functioned as its base of political capital. The business community appreciated its readiness, at moderate cost,  to cut through red tape and legislative mazes to facilitate rapid economic growth. The Tammany Hall [[ward boss]] or [[ward heeler]] – "wards" were the city's smallest political units from 1786 to 1938 – served as the local vote gatherer and provider of patronage.  By 1872 Tammany had an Irish Catholic "boss," and in 1928 a Tammany hero, [[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] [[Al Smith]], won the Democratic presidential nomination.  However, Tammany Hall also served as an engine for [[Graft (politics)|graft]] and [[political corruption]], perhaps most infamously under [[William M. Tweed|William M. "Boss" Tweed]] in the mid-19th century.  By the 1880s, Tammany was building local clubs that appealed to social activists from the ethnic middle class.&lt;ref&gt;Peel, Roy V. ''The Political Clubs of New York City'' (1935)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shefter, Martin. "The electoral foundations of the political machine: New York City, 1884–1897." in [[Joel Silbey]] et al. eds., ''The history of American electoral behavior'' (1978) pp: 263–98, esp pp 294–95.&lt;/ref&gt; In quiet times the machine had the advantage of a core of solid supporters and usually exercised control of politics and policymaking in Manhattan; it also played a major role in the state legislature in [[Albany, New York|Albany]].

[[Charles Francis Murphy|Charles Murphy]] was the highly effective but quiet boss of Tammany from 1902–1924.&lt;ref&gt;Huthmacher (1965)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timothy Sullivan|"Big Tim" Sullivan]] was the Tammany leader in the Bowery, and machine's spokesman in the state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Czitrom, Daniel. "Underworlds and underdogs: Big Tim Sullivan and metropolitan politics in New York, 1889–1913," ''Journal of American History'' (1991) 78#2 pp 536–558 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2079533 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early twentieth century Murphy and Sullivan promoted Tammany as a reformed agency dedicated to the interests of the working class. The new image deflected attacks and built up a following among the emerging ethnic middle class.  In the process [[Robert F. Wagner]] became a powerful United States Senator, and [[Al Smith]] served multiple terms as governor and was the Democratic presidential candidate in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Slayton, Robert A. ''Empire Statesman: The Rise and Redemption of Al Smith'' (2001). ch 6–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huthmacher, J. Joseph. ''Senator Robert F. Wagner and the rise of urban liberalism'' (1968) ch 1–4&lt;/ref&gt;

Tammany Hall's influence waned from 1930 to 1945 when it engaged in a losing battle with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the state's governor (1928–33) and the [[President of the United States|United States president]] (1933–45). In 1932, [[Mayor of New York City|Mayor]] [[Jimmy Walker]] was forced from office when his bribery was exposed. Roosevelt stripped Tammany of federal patronage.  Republican [[Fiorello La Guardia]] was elected mayor on a [[Electoral fusion|Fusion]] ticket and became the first anti-Tammany mayor to be re-elected.  A brief resurgence in Tammany power in the 1950s under the leadership of [[Carmine DeSapio]] was met with Democratic Party opposition led by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Herbert Lehman]], and the New York Committee for Democratic Voters.  By the mid-1960s Tammany Hall ceased to exist.

===1789–1850===
The '''Tammany Society''', also known as the '''Society of St. Tammany''', the '''Sons of St. Tammany''', or the '''Columbian Order''', was founded in New York on May 12, 1789, originally as a branch of a wider network of [[Tammanies|Tammany Societies]], the first having been formed in Philadelphia in 1772.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, Frederick Webb (ed.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=zEcSAAAAYAAJ ''Handbook of Indians North of Mexico''] (Washington: Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin 30. GPO 1911), 2:683–684&lt;/ref&gt; The society was originally developed as a club for "pure Americans".&lt;ref name=tamboo /&gt; The name "Tammany" comes from [[Tamanend]], a Native American leader of the [[Lenape]].  The society adopted many Native American words and also their customs, going so far as to call its hall a [[wigwam]]. The first Grand [[Sachem]], as the leader was titled, was [[William Mooney (Tammany)|William Mooney]], an upholsterer of [[Nassau Street (Manhattan)|Nassau Street]].&lt;ref name="The History of New York State"&gt;[http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/state/his/bk12/ch5/pt1.html The History of New York State&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930024000/http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/state/his/bk12/ch5/pt1.html |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1798, the society's activities had grown increasingly political. High ranking Democratic-Republican [[Aaron Burr]] saw Tammany Hall as an opportunity to counter [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s [[Society of the Cincinnati]] and developed it into a [[political machine]].&lt;ref name=tamboo&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,807536,00.html "Sachems &amp; Sinners: An Informal History of Tammany Hall"] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (August 22, 1955)&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Tammany emerged as the center of [[Democratic-Republican Party]] politics in the city.&lt;ref name="The History of New York State"/&gt; Burr used Tammany Hall influence in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1800|election of 1800]], in which he was elected Vice President of the United States. Many historians believe that without Tammany, President [[John Adams]] might have won New York State's electoral votes and won reelection.&lt;ref&gt;Parmet and Hecht, pp. 149–150&lt;/ref&gt;
	  	
Early cases of political corruption involving Tammany Hall came to light during the group's feud with local politician [[Dewitt Clinton]]. The feud began in 1802 after Clinton accused Aaron Burr of being a traitor to the Democratic-Republican Party.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Myers, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton's uncle, George Clinton was jealous of Burr's achievements and positions. However George was too old to compete with young Aaron Burr, and so he left it to his nephew to topple Burr.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1803, Clinton left the United States Senate and became Mayor of New York City.&lt;ref name=ta21rtv&gt;Myers, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; As mayor, Clinton enforced a spoils system and appointed his family and partisans to positions in the city's local government.&lt;ref name=ta21rtv /&gt; Tammany Hall soon realized its influence over the local political scene was no match for that of Clinton,&lt;ref name=ta21rtv /&gt; in part because Burr's support among New York City's residents greatly faded after he shot and killed [[Alexander Hamilton]] in a duel.&lt;ref name="ta22rtv"&gt;Myers, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Tammany continued to support him for a time,&lt;ref name=ta22rtv /&gt; but eventually pressure from the public persuaded the organization to no longer affiliate themselves with Burr.&lt;ref name=ta22rtv /&gt;
	  	
In December 1805, Dewitt Clinton reached out to supporters of Burr in order to gain enough support to resist the influence of the powerful Livingston family.&lt;ref name=ta22rtv /&gt; The Livingston family, led by former New York City mayor [[Edward Livingston]], backed New York Governor Morgan Lewis which presented a significant challenge to Clinton.&lt;ref name=ta23rtv&gt;Myers, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The Tammany Hall Sachems agreed to meet with him in secret, on February 20, 1806.&lt;ref name=ta23rtv /&gt; and agreed under the condition that the Clintons would once again acknowledge Aaron Burr as a Democratic-Republican, and stop using "Burrism" as a reason to object to their ideas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Clintons readily agreed to conditions, but had no plans on honoring those conditions. When the Sachems caught wind of this, the feud between Tammany Hall and Clinton continued.&lt;ref name=ta22rtv /&gt;
	 	
Tammany Hall afterwards became a locally organized machine dedicated to stopping Clinton and Federalists from rising to power in New York;&lt;ref name=ta24rtv&gt;Myers, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; However, local Democratic-Republicans began to turn against Tammany Hall.&lt;ref name="ta25rtv"&gt;Myers, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;  In the years covering 1806-1809, because of public demand, the local Common Council was forced to crack down on Tammany Hall. The resulting investigations found that a number of Tammany Officials were guilty of embezzlement and illegal activity.&lt;ref name=ta28rtv&gt;Myers, pp. 27–30&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one official, Benjamin Romaine was found guilty of using his power to acquire land without paying. He was then removed from his office of City Comptroller&lt;ref name="ta23rtv" /&gt; due to public demand, despite the Council being controlled by Democrat-Republicans.&lt;ref name="ta23rtv" /&gt; Following the disclosures, the Federalists won control of the state legislature and the Democratic-Republican Party barely maintained control of the local government in New York City.&lt;ref name=ta30rtv&gt;Myers, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tammany Hall did not learn their lesson,&lt;ref name="ta22rtv" /&gt; and instead of fixing the problem of corruption, Wortman, one of the chief powers at the time, created a committee consisting of one member from each ward that would investigate and report in general meetings who were friends, or enemies.&lt;ref name="ta25rtv" /&gt;

During the years between 1809-1810, the feud between Tammany Hall, and Clintonites intensified, as each party threw attacks at each other.&lt;ref name="ta25rtv"/&gt; One of the Clintonites, James Cheetham, set about this by writing about Tammany and its corrupt activities, using his position as State Printer and publishing his work on ''American Citizen.''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Myers, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tammany Hall did not take lightly to these activities, and managed to remove Cheetham from his position of State Printer.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, at the same time, Clinton decided to try and cooperate with Tammany Hall in order to create a state dominated by Democrat-Republicans. In an attempt to successfully persuade Tammany Sachems, he pulled his support for Cheetham, who was his protege at the time.&lt;ref name="ta22rtv" /&gt; Cheetham's loss of Clinton's support angered him, and he responded by releasing details of Tammany and Clinton's attempts at cooperating to control the state.&lt;ref name="ta22rtv" /&gt; On September 18, 1810, James Cheetham died after an attack that was possibly Tammany-related.&lt;ref name="ta22rtv" /&gt;
	  	
Between the years 1809 and 1815, Tammany Hall slowly revived itself by accepting immigrants and by secretly building a new wigwam to hold meetings whenever new Sachems were named.&lt;ref name="ta36rtv"&gt;Myers, pp. 36–38&lt;/ref&gt; The Democratic-Republican Committee, a new committee which consisted of the most influential local Democratic Republicans, would now name the new Sachems as well.&lt;ref name="ta338rtv"&gt;Myers, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; When Dewitt Clinton decided to run for president in 1811, Tammany Hall immediately accused Clinton of treason to his party, as well as attempting to create a family aristocracy. Even though New York State went to Clinton the following year, republicans could not help but see Clinton's actions as exactly what Tammany had accused them of being. With this most republicans in New York City turned from Clinton. When Tammany Hall put itself in support for the War in 1812, many others who supported the war joined Tammany Hall.&lt;ref name="ta39rtv"&gt;Myers, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, during this time, because of its successful establishing on political views, Tammany Hall was able to grow stronger, and even gain support from Federalists members who supported the war.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Myers, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; During this time we see Tammany Hall's earliest application of its most notable technique- turning support away from opposing parties, and rewarding newly joined members.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This was the case for Federalists who joined Tammany Hall. Tammany Hall managed to gain power, as well as reduce Clinton and his followers to just a small fraction.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815, Tammany Hall grand sachem [[John Ferguson (New York politician)|John Ferguson]] defeated Dewitt Clinton and was elected mayor.  In 1817, however, Clinton with his success on the Erie Canal project gained so much popularity, that despite his weak position after the War, and Tammany's immense efforts, once again became Governor of New York and Tammany Hall again, fell.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Myers, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor leading to Clinton's popularity, was his patronage to the immigrants. The origins of Tammany Hall were based on representing "pure" or "native" Americans. This mean that the Hall totally dismissed the immigrants, such as the Irish. In 1817, April 24, discontent for this treatment led to a huge riot during a Tammany general committee session.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Tammany Hall soon began to accept Irish immigrants as members and eventually became dependent on them to maintain viability as a political force.&lt;ref name="Tweedfall" /&gt;  Until his death in 1828, Clinton would remain Governor of New York, with the exception of the two-year-period 1823–1824, and Tammany Hall's influence waned.

During the [[U.S. presidential election, 1828|1828 U.S. presidential election]], Tammany Hall leaders met with Democratic candidate Andrew Jackson and agreed to endorse him after he promised to give them control over the allocation of some federal jobs.&lt;ref name=jacktam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mahalo.com/new-york-election-results/|title=New York Election Results|work=Mahalo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he was elected president, Jackson fulfilled his promise.&lt;ref name=jacktam /&gt;  After 1829, Tammany Hall became the city affiliate of the Democratic Party, controlling most of the New York City elections afterwards.&lt;ref name=uoqbvoaofy /&gt; In the 1830s the [[Loco-Focos]], an anti-monopoly and pro-labor faction of the Democratic Party, became Tammany's main opposition by appealing to workingmen.  Throughout the 1830s and 1840s, the Society expanded its political control even further by earning the loyalty of the city's ever-expanding immigrant community, which functioned as a base of political capital.

The Tammany Hall "[[ward boss]]" served as the local vote gatherer and provider of patronage.&lt;ref&gt;New York City used the designation "ward" for its smallest political units from 1686–1938. The 1686 [[Dongan Charter]] divided the city into six wards and created a Common Council which consisted of an alderman and an assistant alderman elected from each ward. In 1821, the Common Council's authority was expanded so it would also elect the city's mayor, which had previously been appointed by the state government. In 1834, the state constitution was amended and required the city's mayor to be elected by direct popular vote. In 1834, [[Cornelius Van Wyck Lawrence]], a pro-Tammany Democrat, would become the first mayor ever elected by popular vote in the city's history.  See [http://www.gothamgazette.com/index.php/state/1944-a-brief-history-of-election-law-in-new-york "A Brief History of Election Law in New York"] on the Gotham Gazette website&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1840s, hundreds of thousands of Irish immigrants arrived in New York City to escape the [[Great Irish Potato Famine]] and Tammany saw its power grow greatly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racontrs.com/stories/city-hall-stories/tammany-hall-boss-tweed/ "Tammany Hall: Boss Tweed &amp; Thomas Nast"] Racontours&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigrant support===

Tammany Hall's electoral base lay predominantly with New York's burgeoning immigrant constituency, which often exchanged political support for Tammany Hall's patronage. In pre-[[New Deal]] America, the extralegal services that Tammany and other urban political machines provided often served as a rudimentary [[Social welfare provision|public welfare system]]. At first, in the latter 1810s, immigrants were not allowed membership in Tammany Hall.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T003&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchId=R1&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;userGroupName=cuny_hunter&amp;inPS=true&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;contentSegment=&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX2503700502&amp;&amp;docId=GALE%7CCX2503700502&amp;docType=GALE|title=Gale - Enter Product Login|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after protests by Irish militants in 1817, and the invasion of several of their offices, Tammany Hall realized the potential influence Irish immigrants would have in the city. By the 1820s, Tammany Hall was accepting Irish immigrants as members of the group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, Irish immigrants became even more influential during the mid 1840s to early 1850s. With the potato famine in Ireland, by 1850, more than 130,000 immigrants from Ireland lived in New York City.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since the newly arrived immigrants were in deep poverty, Tammany Hall provided them with employment, shelter, and even citizenship sometimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/tammany-hall.cfm|title=Tammany Hall|website=www2.gwu.edu|access-date=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the group gave men looking for work referrals, and [[legal aid]] to those who needed it. Tammany Hall would also provide food and financial aid to families with sick or injured breadwinners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In an example of their involvement in the lives of citizens, in the course of one day, Tammany figure [[George Washington Plunkitt]] assisted the victims of a house fire; secured the release of six "[[Drunkenness|drunks]]" by speaking on their behalf to a judge; paid the rent of a poor family to prevent their eviction and gave them money for food; secured employment for four individuals; attended the funerals of two of his constituents (one Italian, the other Jewish); attended a [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]]; and attended the [[Jewish wedding|wedding of a Jewish couple]] from his ward.&lt;ref&gt;Riordin, pp.91–93&lt;/ref&gt; Tammany Hall took full advantage of the surplus in Irish immigrants to create a healthy relationship to gather more votes. By 1855, 34 percent of New York City's voter population was composed of Irish immigrants, and many Irish men came to dominate Tammany Hall. With this, Tammany Hall started its career as the powerful political machine we associate it with today.

Tammany Hall also served as a social integrator for immigrants by familiarizing them with American society and its political institutions and by helping them become [[Naturalization|naturalized citizens]]. One example was the naturalization process organized by [[William M. Tweed]]. Under Tweed's regime, "naturalization committees" were established.  These "committees" were made up primarily of Tammany politicians and employees, and their duties consisted of filling out paperwork, providing witnesses, and lending immigrants money for the fees required to become citizens. Judges and other city officials were bribed and otherwise compelled to go along with the workings of these committees.&lt;ref&gt;Connable and Silberfarb, p.154&lt;/ref&gt;  In exchange for all these benefits, immigrants assured Tammany Hall they would vote for their candidates.&lt;ref name="uoqbvoaofy" /&gt;  By 1854, the support which Tammany Hall received from immigrants would firmly establish the organization as the leader of New York City's political scene.&lt;ref name="uoqbvoaofy" /&gt;  With the election of [[Fernando Wood]], the first person to be supported by the Tammany Hall machine,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as mayor in 1854, Tammany Hall would proceed to dominate The New York City political arena until [[Fiorello La Guardia]]'s mayoralty after the election of 1934.&lt;ref name="uoqbvoaofy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/tammany-hall.cfm|title=Tammany Hall|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tweed-Boss-LOC.jpg|thumb|215px|[[William M. Tweed]], known as "Boss" Tweed, ran an efficient and corrupt [[political machine]] based on [[political patronage|patronage]] and [[graft (politics)|graft]].]]

===Tweed regime===
{{main|William M. Tweed}}

Tammany's control over the politics of New York City tightened considerably under Tweed. In 1858, Tweed utilized the efforts of Republican reformers to rein in the Democratic city government to obtain a position on the County Board of Supervisors (which he then used as a springboard to other appointments) and to have his friends placed in various offices.  From this position of strength, he was elected "Grand Sachem" of Tammany, which he then used to take functional control of the city government.  With his proteges elected governor of the state and mayor of the city, Tweed was able to expand the corruption and kickbacks of his "Ring" into practically every aspect of city and state governance.  Although Tweed was elected to the State Senate, his true sources of power were his appointed positions to various branches of the city government. These positions gave him access to city funds and contractors, thereby controlling public works programs. This benefitted his pocketbook and those of his friends, but also provided jobs for the immigrants, especially Irish laborers, who were the electoral base of Tammany's power.&lt;ref name=gpassim&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.837 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tweed biographer Kenneth D. Ackerman:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's hard not to admire the skill behind Tweed's system ... The Tweed ring at its height was an engineering marvel, strong and solid, strategically deployed to control key power points: the courts, the legislature, the treasury and the ballot box. Its frauds had a grandeur of scale and an elegance of structure: money-laundering, profit sharing and organization.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, Kenneth D. ''Boss Tweed: The Rise and Fall of the Corrupt Pol Who Conceived the Soul of Modern New York'' New York: [[Carroll &amp; Graf]], 2005; quoted in [[Pete Hamill|Hammill, Pete]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/27/books/review/027HAMILL.html?_r=0 "'Boss Tweed': The Fellowship of the Ring"] ''[[New York Times]]'' (March 27, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under "Boss" Tweed's dominance, the city expanded into the [[Upper East Side|Upper East]] and [[Upper West Side]]s of Manhattan, the Brooklyn Bridge was begun, land was set aside for the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], orphanages and almshouses were constructed, and social services – both directly provided by the state and indirectly funded by state appropriations to private charities – expanded to unprecedented levels.  All of this activity, of course, also brought great wealth to Tweed and his friends. It also brought them into contact and alliance with the rich elite of the city, who either fell in with the graft and corruption, or else tolerated it because of Tammany's ability to control the immigrant population, of whom the "[[uppertens]]" of the city were wary.

It was therefore Tammany's demonstrated ''inability'' to control Irish laborers in the [[Orange riot]] of 1871 that began Tweed's downfall. Campaigns to topple Tweed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[Thomas Nast]] of ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' began to gain traction in the aftermath of the riot, and disgruntled insiders began to leak the details of the extent and scope of the Tweed Ring's avarice to the newspapers.

Tweed was arrested and tried in 1872.  He died in [[Ludlow Street Jail]], and political reformers took over the city and state governments.&lt;ref name=gpassim /&gt;  Following Tweed's arrest, Tammany survived but was no longer controlled just by Protestants and was now dependent on leadership from bosses of Irish descent.&lt;ref name=Tweedfall&gt;{{cite book |last=Panayiotopoulos |first=Prodromos |title=Immigrant enterprise in Europe and the USA|page=52|year=2006|publisher=Routledge Studies in the Modern World Economy|isbn=0-415-35371-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tammany Tiger Hunted 1893.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' cartoon by [[Frederick Burr Opper]]: "Lots of hunters after a very sick tiger" (1893)]]

===1870–1900 {{anchor|1870-1900}}===

Tammany did not take long to rebound from Tweed's fall. Reforms demanded a general housecleaning, and former county sheriff [[John Kelly (New York politician)|"Honest John" Kelly]] was selected as the new leader.  Kelly was not implicated in the Tweed scandals, and was a religious Catholic related by marriage to Archbishop [[John McCloskey]]. He cleared Tammany of Tweed's people, and tightened the Grand Sachem's control over the hierarchy.  His success at revitalizing the machine was such that in the election of 1874, the Tammany candidate, [[William H. Wickham]], unseated the unpopular reformist incumbent, [[William F. Havemeyer]], and Democrats generally won their races, delivering control of the city back to Tammany Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.1027&lt;/ref&gt;

====1886 mayoral election====

The mayoral election of 1886 was a seminal one for the organization.  Union activists had founded the [[Central Labor Union|United Labor Party]] (ULP), which nominated [[political economist]] [[Henry George]], the author of ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'', as its standard-bearer.  George was initially hesitant about running for office, but was convinced to do so after Tammany secretly offered him a seat in Congress if he would stay out of the mayoral race.  Tammany had no expectation of George being elected, but knew that his candidacy and the new party were a direct threat to their own status as the putative champions of the working man.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.1099&lt;/ref&gt;

Having inadvertently provoked George into running, Tammany now needed to field a strong candidate against him, which required the cooperation of the Catholic Church in New York, which was the key to getting the support of middle-class Irish-American voters.  [[Richard Croker]], Kelly's right-hand man, had succeeded Kelly as Grand Sachem of Tammany, and he understood that he would also need to make peace with the non-Tammany "Swallowtail" faction of the Democratic Party to avoid the threat that George and the ULP posed, which was the potential re-structuring of the city's politics along class lines and away from the ethnic-based politics which has been Tammany's underpinning all along.  To bring together these disparate groups, Croker nominated [[Abram Hewitt]] as the Democratic candidate for mayor.  Not only was Hewitt the leader of the Swallowtails, but he was noted philanthropist [[Peter Cooper]]'s son-in-law, and had an impeccable reputation.  To counter both George and Hewitt, the Republicans put up [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the former state assemblyman.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, pp.1103–1106&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tammany Hall interior for the national convention 1868 crop.jpeg|thumb|350px|Tammany Hall decorated for the [[1868 Democratic National Convention]]]]

In the end, Hewitt won the election, with George out-polling Roosevelt, whose total was some 2,000 votes less than the Republicans had normally received.  Despite their second-place finish, things seemed bright for the future of the labor political movement, but the ULP was not to last, and was never able to bring about a new paradigm in the city's politics. Tammany had once again succeeded and survived.  More than that, Croker realized that he could utilize the techniques of the well-organized election campaign that ULP had run.  Because Tammany's ward-heelers controlled the saloons, the new party had used "neighborhood meetings,  streetcorner rallies, campaign clubs, Assembly District organizations, and trade legions – an entire political counterculture"&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.1100&lt;/ref&gt; to run their campaign.  Croker now took these innovations for Tammany's use, creating political clubhouses to take the place of the saloons and involving women and children by sponsoring family excursions and picnics.  The New Tammany appeared to be more respectable, and less obviously connected to saloon-keepers and gang leaders, and the clubhouses, one in every Assembly District, were also a more efficient way of providing patronage work to those who came looking for it; one simply had to join the club, and volunteer to put in the hours needed to support it.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, pp.1106–1108&lt;/ref&gt;

Hewitt turned out to be a terrible mayor, due to his personality defects and his nativist views, and in 1888 Tammany ran Croker's hand-picked choice, [[Hugh J. Grant]], who became the first New York-born Irish-American mayor.  Grant allowed Croker free run of the city's contracts and offices, creating a vast patronage machine beyond anything Tweed had ever dreamed of, a status which continued under Grant's successor, [[Thomas Francis Gilroy]].  With such resources of money and manpower – the entire city workforce of 1,200 was essentially available to him when needed – Croker was able to neutralize the Swallowtails permanently. He also developed a new stream of income from the business community, which was provided with "one stop shopping": instead of bribing individual office-holders, businesses, especially the utilities, could go directly to Tammany to make their payments, which were then directed downward as necessary; such was the control Tammany had come to have over the governmental apparatus of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, pp.1108–1109&lt;/ref&gt;

Croker mended fences with labor as well, pushing through legislation which addressed some of the inequities which had fueled the labor political movement, making Tammany once again appear to be the "Friend of the Working Man" – although he was careful always to maintain a pro-business climate of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' and low taxes. Tammany's influence was also extended once again to the state legislature, where a similar patronage system to the city's was established after Tammany took control in 1892.  With the Republican boss, [[Thomas C. Platt|Thomas Platt]], adopting the same methods, the two men between them essentially controlled the state.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, pp.1109–1110&lt;/ref&gt;

====1894 mayoral election====
[[File:Rogers, W. A. (William Allen), Rogers A Cinch 1893 Cornell CUL PJM 1112 01.jpg|thumb|215px|A [[bird's-eye]]-view map of New York and Brooklyn (1893), titled "A Cinch. Says Boss Croker to Boss McLaughlin: "Shake!"&lt;br&gt;(The boss of Tammany Hall in New York, Richard Croker, and the boss of the Brooklyn political machine, Hugh McLaughlin, reach across the East River to shake hands in cooperation).]]

In 1894, Tammany suffered a setback when, fueled by the public hearings on police corruption held by the [[Lexow Committee]] based on the evidence uncovered by the Rev. [[Charles Henry Parkhurst|Charles Parkhurst]] when he explored the city's ''[[demi monde]]'' undercover, a Committee of Seventy was organized by Council of Good Government Clubs to break the stranglehold that Tammany had on the city.  Full of some of the city's richest men – [[J.P. Morgan]], [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], [[Abram Hewitt]] and [[Elihu Root]], among others – the committee supported [[William L. Strong]], a millionaire dry-goods merchant, for mayor, and forced Tammany's initial candidate, merchant [[Nathan Straus]], co-owner of [[Macy's]] and [[Abraham &amp; Straus]], from the election by threatening to ostracize him from New York society.  Tammany then put up Hugh Grant again, despite his being publicly dirtied by the police scandals.  Backed by the Committee's money, influence and their energetic campaign, and helped by Grant's apathy, Strong won the election handily, and spent the next three years running the city on the basis of "business principles", pledging an efficient government and the return of morality to city life.  The election was a Republican sweep statewide: [[Levi Morton]], a millionaire banker from Manhattan, won the governorship, and the party also ended up in control of the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, pp.1192–1194&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, Tammany could not be kept down for long, and in 1898 Croker, aided by the death of [[Henry George]] – which took the wind out of the sails of the potential re-invigoration of the political labor movement – shifted the Democratic Party enough to the left to pick up labor's support, and pulled back into the fold those elements outraged by the reformers' attempt to outlaw Sunday drinking and otherwise enforce their own authoritarian moral concepts on immigrant populations with different cultural outlooks.  Tammany's candidate, [[Robert A. Van Wyck]] easily outpolled [[Seth Low]], the reform candidate backed by the Citizens Union, and Tammany was back in control.  Its supporters marched through the city's streets chanting, "Well, well, well, Reform has gone to Hell!"&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, pp.1206–1208&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New York's New Solar System2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|All politics revolved around the Boss. 1899 cartoon from ''Puck''.]]

Despite occasional defeats, Tammany was consistently able to survive and prosper. Under leaders such as [[Charles Francis Murphy]] and [[Timothy Sullivan]], it maintained control of Democratic politics in the city and the state.

==20th century==

=== Machine politics versus the reformers ===
The politics of the consolidated city from 1898 to 1945 revolved around conflicts between the political machines and the reformers.  In quiet times the machines had the advantage of the core of solid supporters and usually exercised control of city and borough affairs; they also played a major role in the state legislature in Albany. Tammany for example from the 1880s onward built a strong network of local clubs that attracted ambitious middle-class ethnics.&lt;ref&gt;Roy V. Peel, ''The Political Clubs of New York City'' (1935)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Shefter, "The electoral foundations of the political machine: New York City, 1884–1897." in Joel Silbey et al. eds., ''The history of American electoral behavior'' (1978) pp: 263–98, esp pp 294–95.&lt;/ref&gt;  In times of crisis however, especially in the severe depressions of the 1890s and the 1930s, the reformers took control of key offices, notably the mayor's office. The reformers were never unified; they operated through a complex network of independent civic reform groups, each focused its lobbying efforts on its own particular reform agenda. The membership included civic minded, well-educated middle-class men and women, usually with expert skills in a profession or business, who deeply distrusted the corruption of the machines.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Skolnik, "Civic Group Progressivism In New York City," ''New York History'' (1970) 51#5 pp 411–439.&lt;/ref&gt; Consolidation in 1898 multiplied the power of these reform groups, so long as they could agree on a common agenda, Such as consolidation itself.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Hammack, ''Power and Society: Greater New York at the Turn of the Century (1982) pp 308–13&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no citywide machine.  Instead Democratic machines flourished in each of the boroughs, with Tammany Hall in Manhattan the most prominent. They typically had strong local organizations, known as "political clubs", as well as one prominent leader often called "the boss". [[Charles Francis Murphy|Charles Murphy]] was the highly effective but quiet boss of Tammany Hall from 1902–1924.&lt;ref&gt;J.

He lacked the common touch, and lost much of his working class support when he listened to dry Protestants eager to crack down on the liquor business.&lt;ref&gt;"Seth Low," in Jackson,''Encyclopedia of New York City,''  (1996)  p 695&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven C.

From 1902 until his death in 1924, [[Charles Francis Murphy]] was Tammany's boss. Murphy wanted to clean up Tammany's image, and he sponsored progressive era reforms benefiting the working class through his two protégés, Governor [[Alfred E. Smith|Al Smith]] and [[Robert F. Wagner]]. [[Edward J. Flynn|Ed Flynn]], a protégé of Murphy who became the boss in the Bronx, said Murphy always advised that politicians should have nothing to do with gambling or prostitution,  and should steer clear of involvement with the police department or the school system.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Golway, ''Machine Made: Tammany Hall and the Creation of Modern American Politics'' (2014)  p 186&lt;/ref&gt;

A new challenge to Tammany came from [[William Randolph Hearst]], a powerful newspaper publisher who wanted to be president. Hearst was elected to Congress with Tammany support, was defeated for mayor after a bitter contest with Tammany, and won Tammany support for his unsuccessful quest for the governorship of New York. Hearst did manage to dominate Tammany mayor [[John F. Hylan]] (1917–25), but he lost control when Smith and Wagner denied Hylan renomination in 1925. Hearst then moved to California.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Proctor, ''William Randolph Hearst: The Early Years, 1863–1910'' the parenthesis 1998) ch 11&lt;/ref&gt;

===La Guardia in, Tammany out: 1933 to 1945===
In 1932, the machine suffered a dual setback when [[Jimmy Walker|Mayor James Walker]] was forced from office by scandal and reform-minded Democrat [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was elected president of the United States. Tammany Hall leader [[John F. Curry (politician)|John F. Curry]] and Brooklyn political boss [[John H. McCooey]] had joined forces to support [[Al Smith]]'s candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1932/07/03/archives/curry-and-mccooey-to-support-ticket-roosevelt-held-luckiest-man-in.html|title=Curry and McCooey to Support Ticket; Roosevelt Held 'Luckiest Man' in Nation|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 3, 1932|page=10|accessdate=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt and his lead campaign manager [[James Farley]] stripped Tammany of federal patronage, which had been expanded under the [[New Deal]]—and passed it instead to [[Edward J. Flynn|Ed Flynn]], boss of the Bronx who had kept his district clean of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/flynn-edward.cfm "Edward Flynn (1891–1953)"] [[George Washington University]] website&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt helped Republican [[Fiorello La Guardia]] become mayor on a [[Electoral fusion|Fusion]] ticket, thus removing even more patronage from Tammany's control. La Guardia was elected in 1933.&lt;ref name=ihhovz /&gt; After becoming mayor, LaGuardia reorganized the city cabinet with non-partisan officials and sought to develop a clean and honest city government.&lt;ref name=ihhovz /&gt;

As mayor, LaGuardia successfully led the effort to have a new city charter adopted which would mandate a proportional representation method of electing members of the City Council. The measure won on a referendum in 1936.&lt;ref name=ihhovz /&gt; After the new charter went into effect in 1938, the ward system which had allowed only a small number of people to serve on the City Council since 1686 ceased to exist, and the new 26-member New York City Council now had certain functions governed by the [[New York City Board of Estimate|Board of Estimate]].&lt;ref name=cityqctrade&gt;[http://council.nyc.gov/html/about/history.shtml New York City Council website&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; La Guardia's appointees filled the board of magistrates and virtually every other long-term appointive office, and the power of Tammany Hall had now been reduced to a shadow of what it once was.&lt;ref name=ihhovz /&gt; In 1937, LaGuardia became the first anti-Tammany "reform" Mayor to ever be re-elected in the city's history&lt;ref name=ihhovz /&gt; and was again re-elected in 1941 before retiring in 1945.&lt;ref name=ihhovz /&gt; His extended tenure weakened Tammany in a way that previous reform mayors had not.&lt;ref name=ihhovz&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1211.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=La Guardia Is Dead; City Pays Homage To 3-Time Mayor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tammany depended for its power on government contracts, jobs, patronage, corruption, and ultimately the ability of its leaders to control nominations to the Democratic ticket and swing the popular vote. The last element weakened after 1940 with the decline of relief programs like [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] and [[Civilian Conservation Corps|CCC]] that Tammany used to gain and hold supporters. Congressman [[Christopher D. Sullivan|Christopher "Christy" Sullivan]] was one of the last "bosses" of Tammany Hall before its collapse.

===Criminal issues===
Manhattan [[District Attorney]] [[Thomas E. Dewey]] also got longtime Tammany Hall boss [[James Joseph Hines|Jimmy Hines]] convicted of bribery in 1939&lt;ref name=tamboo /&gt; and sentenced to 4–8 years.&lt;ref&gt;Hines, James J. [http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~law00151 Newspaper Clippings from the Trials, 1938–1940: Finding Aid] [[Harvard Law School]] Library website&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of Hines would serve as a major blow to Tammany, as he had given the political machine strong ties to the city's powerful organized crime figures since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/gang/harlem_gangs/6.html|title=truTV - Reality TV - Comedy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few years prior, Dewey also had powerful mobster and strong Tammany ally [[Lucky Luciano]] convicted of racketeering and sentenced to 30–50 years;&lt;ref name=tammob&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/gang/harlem_gangs/8.html|title=truTV - Reality TV - Comedy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Luciano was still able to maintain control of the powerful [[Genovese crime family|Luciano crime family]] from prison until his sentence was commuted to deportation to Italy in 1946.&lt;ref name=frankcost /&gt; Several Tammany Hall officials affiliated with Hines and Luciano were also successfully prosecuted by Dewey.&lt;ref name=tammob /&gt;

===Indian Summer, 1950s===
Tammany never recovered, but it staged a small-scale comeback in the early 1950s under the leadership of [[Carmine DeSapio]], who succeeded in engineering the elections of [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.]], an outspoken liberal Democrat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/13/obituaries/robert-wagner-80-pivotal-new-york-mayor-dies.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|first=James F. |last=Clarity |title=Robert Wagner, 80, Pivotal New York Mayor, Dies |date=February 13, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; as mayor in 1953 and [[W. Averell Harriman]] as state governor in 1954, while simultaneously blocking his enemies, especially [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Jr.]] in the 1954 race for state Attorney General. Unlike previous Tammany "bosses", however, DeSapio had promoted himself as a reformer and always made his decisions known to the public.&lt;ref name=uoqpz&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/28/nyregion/carmine-de-sapio-political-kingmaker-and-last-tammany-hall-boss-dies-at-95.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Jonathan |last=Kandell |title=Carmine De Sapio, Political Kingmaker and Last Tammany Hall Boss, Dies at 95 |date=July 28, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that DeSapio was of Italian descent also demonstrated that Tammany was no longer dominated by Irish-American politicians.&lt;ref name=uoqpz /&gt; Under DeSapio's leadership, the nationality of Tammany Hall's leaders diversified.&lt;ref name=uoqpz /&gt; However, DeSapio's close ties with the city's lead mobster [[Frank Costello]], Luciano's self-appointed successor,&lt;ref name=frankcost&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freeinfosociety.com/article.php?id=30|title=Articles/Biographies/Criminals/Costello, Frank|publisher=Free Information Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped establish him as a corrupt figure.&lt;ref name=uoqpz /&gt; During DeSapio's reign, Costello was the main person who influenced the decisions made by Tammany Hall officials.&lt;ref name=uoqpz /&gt;

By 1956, however, Costello, who was convicted of tax evasion in 1954 and now controlled the Luciano family from prison, was engaged in a major power struggle with fellow associate [[Vito Genovese]] and his grip on power greatly weakened.&lt;ref name=frankcost /&gt; In 1957, Costello was released from prison after winning an appeal but officially abandoned his role as head of the Luciano family following a failed assassination attempt.&lt;ref name=frankcost /&gt; In 1958, DeSapio's "reform" image was severely damaged after he ran his own candidate for Senate, Manhattan District Attorney [[Frank Hogan]].&lt;ref name=uoqpz /&gt; New Yorkers now saw DeSapio as an old-time Tammany Hall boss, and Hogan would lose the Senate election to Republican [[Kenneth Keating]];&lt;ref name=uoqpz /&gt; Republican [[Nelson Rockefeller]] would also be elected Governor the same year.&lt;ref name=uoqpz /&gt; Democrats who once praised De Sapio now excoriated him.&lt;ref name=uoqpz /&gt; In 1961, Wagner won re-election by running a reformist campaign that denounced his former patron, DeSapio, as an undemocratic practitioner of Tammany machine politics.&lt;ref name=uoqpz /&gt; [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] organized a counterattack with [[Herbert H. Lehman]] and [[Thomas K. Finletter]] to form the New York Committee for Democratic Voters, a group dedicated to fighting Tammany. In 1961, the group helped remove DeSapio from power. The once mighty Tammany political machine, now deprived of its leadership, quickly faded from political importance, and by 1967 it ceased to exist; its demise as the controlling group of the New York Democratic Party was sealed when the Village Independent Democrats under [[Ed Koch]] wrested away control of the Manhattan party.{{clear}}

[[Image:Tammany Hall LC-USZ62-101734.jpg|thumb|225px|Tammany Hall on [[14th Street (Manhattan)|East 14th Street]] between [[Third Avenue (Manhattan)|Third Avenue]] and [[Irving Place]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]] (1914).  The building was demolished c.1927.]]
[[File:Tammany Hall 17th Street.jpg|thumb|225px|The former Tammany Hall building at [[17th Street (Manhattan)|17th Street]] and [[Park Avenue South]], across from [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]], housed a theatre and a film school until renovations commenced in 2016.]]

==Headquarters==
In its very early days, the Tammany Society met in the back rooms of various taverns, most often in Barden's Tavern on Broadway near Bowling Green.&lt;ref name=allen7&gt;Allen, pp.7–8&lt;/ref&gt; These back rooms served as unofficial campaign headquarters on election days.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace p.322&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1791, the society opened a museum designed to collect artifacts relating to the events and history of the United States. Originally presented in an upper room of City Hall, it moved to the Merchant's Exchange when that proved to be too small. The museum was unsuccessful, and the Society severed its connections with it in 1795.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace p.316&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, in 1798, the Society moved to more permanent and spacious quarters, the "Long Room" of "Brom" Martling's Tavern, at [[Nassau Street (Manhattan)|Nassau Street]] and Spruce Street, near where City Hall is today. Tammany controlled the space, which it dubbed "The Wigwam", and let other responsible political organizations it approved of use the room for meetings. This space became commonly known as "Tammany Hall".&lt;ref name=allen7 /&gt;

Their new headquarters had limitations as well as advantages, and in 1812 Tammany moved again, this time to a new five-story $55,000 building it built at the corner of Nassau and Frankfort Streets, just a few blocks away.  The new Tammany Hall had a large room that could accommodate up to 2,000 people for political and social events, and the rest of the building was run as a hotel. The Society was to remain there for 55 years.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1860s, Tammany under Tweed had much greater influence &amp;ndash; and affluence, so new headquarters was deemed desirable. The cornerstone for the new Tammany headquarters was laid on July 14, 1867, at 141 [[14th Street (Manhattan)|East 14th Street]] between [[Third Avenue (Manhattan)|Third Avenue]] and [[Fourth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fourth Avenues]] (the building at Nassau and Frankfort was sold to [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles Dana]] and his friends, who bought a newspaper, ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'', and moved it there&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Frank Michael. [https://books.google.com/books?id=v56BHdBvdR8C&amp;pg=PA229 ''The Story of the Sun: New York, 1833–1918''] George H. Doran Co, 1916. p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;).

When the leaders of the Society found that they had not raised enough funds, and needed $25,000 more, a meeting was held at which $175,000 was immediately pledged.&lt;ref name=allen99&gt;Allen, pp.99–100&lt;/ref&gt; The new Wigwam was completed in 1868. It was not just a political clubhouse:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tammany Hall merged politics and entertainment, already stylistically similar, in its new headquarters. ... The Tammany Society kept only one room for itself, renting the rest to entertainment impresarios: Don Bryant's Minstrels, a German theater company, classical concerts and opera. The basement – in the French mode – offered the Café Ausant, where one could see [[Tableau vivant|tableaux vivant]], gymnastic exhibitions, pantomimes, and [[Punch and Judy]] shows. There was also a bar, a bazaar, a Ladies' Cafe, and an [[oyster saloon]]. All this – with the exception of Bryant's – was open from seven till midnight for a combination price of fifty cents.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace p.995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The building had an auditorium big enough to hold public meetings, and a smaller one that became [[Tony Pastor|Tony Pastor's Music Hall]], where [[vaudeville]] had its beginnings.&lt;ref&gt;Wurman, Richard Saul. ''Access New York City''. New York: HarperCollins, 2000. {{ISBN|0-06-277274-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure was topped off by a large-than-life statue of Saint Tammany.&lt;ref name=allen99 /&gt;

In 1927 the building on 14th Street was sold, to make way for the new tower being added to the [[Consolidated Edison Company Building]]. The Society's new building, in Manhattan on [[17th Street (Manhattan)|East 17th Street]] and [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square East]], was finished and occupied by 1929.&lt;ref name="preserve2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.preserve2.org/gramercy/proposes/new/district/100_102e17.htm |title=Second Tammany Hall Building Proposed as Historic Landmark |accessdate=March 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Tammany started to lose its political influence, and its all-important access to graft, it could no longer afford to maintain the 17th Street building, and in 1943 it was bought by a local affiliate of the [[International Ladies Garment Workers Union]]. Tammany left, and its leaders moved to the National Democratic Club on Madison Avenue at East 33rd Street, and the Society's collection of memorabilia went into a warehouse in the Bronx.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, p.259&lt;/ref&gt; The building housed the [[New York Film Academy]] and the [[Union Square Theatre]], and retail stores at street level, until a complete renovation of the building began in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2016/01/tammany-hall-empties-out.html|title=Tammany Hall Empties Out|first=Jeremiah |last=Moss|date=January 11, 2016|publisher=Vanishing New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="curbed_2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ny.curbed.com/2014/11/26/10017782/landmarks-nixes-tammany-halls-glass-tortoise-shell-topper|title=Landmarks Nixes Tammany Hall's Glass Tortoise Shell Topper |first=Evan|last=Bindelglass|date=November 26, 2014|newspaper=[[Curbed|Curbed NY]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] designated it in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2013/10/tammany-hall-named-an-official-city-landmark Tammany Hall a Landmark] ''[[New York Daily News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Plans to add a glass dome to the building were nixed by the Landmarks Commission in 2014; however, the interior is still slated to be completely rebuilt, including demolishing the theater.&lt;ref name="curbed_2014" /&gt; In 2015, a scaled-back version of the glass dome was approved by the commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ny.curbed.com/2015/3/11/9982138/shrunken-tortoise-shell-topper-approved-for-tammany-hall|title=Shrunken Tortoise Shell Topper Approved for Tammany Hall|date=March 11, 2015|newspaper=[[Curbed|Curbed NY]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this paper, I will use the expression “tax haven” and “offshore financial center” interchangeably (the list of tax havens considered by Dharmapala and Hines (2009) is identical to the list of offshore financial centers considered by the Financial Stability Forum (IMF, 2000), barring minor exceptions)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional tax havens, like Jersey, are open about zero rates of taxation, but as a consequence have limited bilateral [[tax treaty|tax treaties]].  Modern [[corporate tax haven]]s have non-zero "headline" rates of taxation and high levels of [[OECD]]–compliance, and thus have large networks of bilateral [[Tax treaty|tax treaties]].  However, their [[base erosion and profit shifting]] ("BEPS") tools enable corporates to achieve "effective" tax rates closer to zero, not just in the haven but in all countries with which the haven has tax treaties; putting them on tax haven lists.  According to modern studies, the {{slink|#Top 10 tax havens}} include corporate-focused havens like Ireland, the Netherlands, Singapore, and the U.K., while Switzerland, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, and the Caribbean (the Caymans, Bermuda, and the British Virgin Islands), feature as both major traditional tax havens and major corporate tax havens.  Corporate tax havens often serve as [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|"conduits"]] to traditional tax havens.&lt;ref name="guar"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/25/netherlands-and-uk-are-biggest-channels-for-corporate-tax-avoidance|title=Netherlands and UK are biggest channels for corporate tax avoidance|publisher=The Guardian|date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloom"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-31/is-the-u-k-already-the-kind-of-tax-haven-it-claims-it-won-t-be|title=Is the U.K. Already the Kind of Tax Haven It Claims It Won't Be?|publisher=Bloomberg News|date=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloom2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-04-11/tax-havens-can-be-surprisingly-close-to-home|title=Tax Havens Can Be Surprisingly Close to Home|publisher=Bloomberg View|date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of tax havens, traditional and corporate, results in a loss of tax revenues to countries which are not tax havens. Estimates of total amounts of taxes avoided vary, but the most credible have a range of US$100–250 billion per annum.&lt;ref name="zucwsj"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/corporations-push-profits-into-tax-havens-as-countries-struggle-in-pursuit-study-says-1528634659|title=Zucman:Corporations Push Profits Into Corporate Tax Havens as Countries Struggle in Pursuit, Gabrial Zucman Study Says|quote=Such profit shifting leads to a total annual revenue loss of $250 billion globally|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gzuc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BEPS Background"/&gt; In addition, capital held in tax havens can permanently leave the tax base (base erosion). Estimates of capital held in tax havens also vary: the most credible estimates are between $7–10 trillion (up to 10% of global assets).&lt;ref name=Zucman/&gt; The harm of traditional and corporate tax havens has been particularly noted in developing nations, where the tax revenues are needed to build infrastructure.&lt;ref name="zucc"/&gt;

At least 15%{{efn|name=number|The [[list of sovereign states]] numbered 206 as at September 2018, so 15% equates to just over 30 tax havens; the OECD's 2000 list had 35 tax havens,&lt;ref name="OECDh"/&gt; the [[James R.

Because of {{slink|#Inflated GDP-per-capita}} (due to accounting BEPS flows), havens are prone to over-leverage (international capital misprice the artificial debt-to-GDP). This can lead to severe credit cycles and/or property/banking crises when international capital flows are repriced. Ireland's [[Celtic Tiger]], and the subsequent financial crisis in 2009–13, is an example.&lt;ref name="ber"/&gt;  [[Jersey]] is another.&lt;ref name="jersey"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/08/fall-of-jersey-how-tax-haven-goes-bust|title=The fall of Jersey: how a tax haven goes bust|publisher=The Guardian|author=Oliver Bullough|quote=Jersey bet its future on finance but since 2007 it has fallen on hard times and is heading for bankruptcy.

The issue, however, is material, as being labelled a "tax haven" has consequences for a country seeking to develop and trade under bilateral tax treaties. When Ireland was "blacklisted" by G20 member Brazil in 2016, bilateral trade declined.&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/ireland-brazil-funds/blacklisted-by-brazil-dublin-funds-find-new-ways-to-invest-idUSL8N1MK2NX|title=Blacklisted by Brazil, Dublin funds find new ways to invest|publisher=Reuters|date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxjustice.net/2017/04/10/tax-haven-blacklisting-13-latin-american-countries/|title=Tax haven blacklisting in Latin America|publisher=Tax Justice Network|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is even more onerous for corporate tax havens, whose foreign multinationals rely on the haven's extensive network of bilateral [[tax treaties]], through which the foreign multinationals execute BEPS transactions, re-routing global untaxed income to the haven.

In April 2000, the [[Financial Stability Forum]] (or FSF) defined the related concept of an [[offshore financial centre]] (or OFC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_0004b.pdf?page_moved=1|title=Report from the Working Group on Offshore Centres|publisher=[[Financial Stability Forum]]|date=5 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the IMF adopted in June 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/mae/oshore/2000/eng/back.htm|title=Offshore Financial Centers: IMF Background Paper|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|date=23 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; An OFC is similar to a "tax haven" and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but the term OFC is less controversial and pejorative.&lt;ref name="missing profits"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academic-foresights.com/Tax_Havens.pdf|quote=Some experts see no difference between tax havens and OFCs and employ the terms interchangeably. |title=Tax Havens and Offshore Financial Centres|publisher=University of Birmingham|author=[[Ronen Palan]]|date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ronen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100541250|page=24|quote=Yet today it is difficult to distinguish between the activities of tax havens and OFCs.| title=Tax Havens and Offshore Financial Centres|publisher=Cornell University Press|author=[[Ronen Palan]]|author2=[[Richard Murphy (tax campaigner)|Richard Murphy]]|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSF–IMF definition focused on the [[BEPS]] tools havens offer, and on [[James R.

The FSF–IMF list captured new [[corporate tax havens]], such as the Netherlands, which Hines considered too small in 1994.&lt;ref name="TJN1"/&gt; 

In December 2008, Dharmapala wrote that the OECD process had removed much of the need to include "bank secrecy" in any definition of a tax haven and that it was now "first and foremost, low or zero corporate tax rates",&lt;ref name="dhh"/&gt; and this has become the general "financial dictionary" definition of a tax haven.&lt;ref name="ftlex"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt;

In October 2009, the [[Tax Justice Network]] introduced the [[Financial Secrecy Index]] ("FSI") and the term "secrecy jurisdiction",&lt;ref name="tjn10"/&gt; to highlight issues in regard to OECD-compliant countries who have high tax rates and do not appear on academic lists of tax havens, but have transparency issues. The FSI does not assess tax rates or BEPS flows in its calculation; but it is often misinterpreted as a tax haven definition in the financial media,{{efn|name=FSI}} particularly when it lists the USA and Germany as major "secrecy jurisdictions".&lt;ref name="Drucker2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wood|first=Robert W.|title=The World's Next Top Tax Haven Is...America|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2016/01/27/the-worlds-next-top-tax-haven-is-america|accessdate=7 June 2016|work=Forbes|date=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Swanson|first=Ana|title=How the U.S. became one of the world's biggest tax havens|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/05/how-the-u-s-became-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-tax-havens/|accessdate=23 April 2016|work=Washington Post|date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many types of tax havens also rank as secrecy jurisdictions.

In October 2010, Hines published a list of [[James R. Hines Jr.#Hines 2010 list|52 tax havens]], scaled by analysing corporate investment flows.&lt;ref name="h1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.ie/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1716&amp;context=articles|title=Treasure Islands|page=103-125|author=[[James R.

In July 2017, the [[University of Amsterdam]]'s CORPNET group ignored any definition of a tax haven and focused on a purely quantitive approach, analysing 98 million global corporate connections on the [[Bureau van Dijk|Orbis database]]. CORPNET's lists of top five [[Conduit and Sink OFCs#Conduit OFC|Conduit OFCs]], and top five [[Conduit and Sink OFCs#Sink OFC|Sink OFCs]], matched 9 of the top 10 havens in Hines' 2010 list, only differing in the United Kingdom, which only [[Corporate haven#U.K. transformation|transformed their tax code in 2009–12]]. CORPNET's [[Conduit and Sink OFCs]] study split the understanding of a tax haven into two classifications:&lt;ref name="xx"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Javier Garcia-Bernardo|author2=Jan Fichtner|author3=Frank W.

*  24 Sink OFCs: jurisdictions in which a disproportionate amount of value disappears from the economic system (e.g. the traditional [[tax havens]]).
*  5 Conduit OFCs: jurisdictions through which a disproportionate amount of value moves toward sink OFCs (e.g. the modern [[corporate tax haven]]s).

In June 2018, tax academic [[Gabriel Zucman]] (''et alia'') published research that also ignored any definition of a tax haven, but estimated the corporate "profit shifting" (i.e. [[BEPS]]), and "enhanced corporate profitability" that Hines and Dharmapala had noted.&lt;ref name="gbz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gabriel-zucman.eu/missingprofits/|title=The Missing Profits of Nations|quote=Appendix Table 2: Tax Havens|page=31|author1=[[Gabriel Zucman]]|author2=Thomas Torslov|author3=Ludvig Wier|publisher=[[National Bureau of Economic Research]], Working Papers|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zucman pointed out that the CORPNET research under-represented havens associated with US technology firms, like Ireland and the [[Cayman Islands]], as Google, Facebook and Apple do not appear on Orbis.&lt;ref name="zucz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/TWZ2018Slides.pdf|page=35|title=The Missing Profits of Nations|author=[[Gabriel Zucman]]|publisher=[[National Bureau of Economic Research]], Working Papers| date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, Zucman's 2018 list of top 10 havens also matched 9 of the top 10 havens in Hines' 2010 list, but with Ireland as the largest global haven.&lt;ref name="zux"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/ireland-is-the-world-s-biggest-corporate-tax-haven-say-academics-1.3528401?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fireland-is-the-world-s-biggest-corporate-tax-haven-say-academics-1.3528401|title=Ireland is the world’s biggest corporate ‘tax haven’, say academics|quote=New Gabriel Zucman study claims State shelters more multinational profits than the entire Caribbean|publisher=Irish Times|date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lists (Hines 2010, CORPNET 2017 and Zucman 2018), and others, which followed a purely quantitive approach, showed a firm consensus around the largest corporate tax havens.

| Non–governmental, Qualitative: these follow a subjective scoring system based on various attributes (e.g. type of tax structures available in the haven); the best known are [[Oxfam]]'s ''Corporate Tax Havens'' list,&lt;ref name="Oxfam"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfam.org/en/research/tax-battles-dangerous-global-race-bottom-corporate-tax | title=Tax Battles: the dangerous global race to the bottom on corporate tax | publisher=Oxfam|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://d1tn3vj7xz9fdh.cloudfront.net/s3fs-public/bp-race-to-bottom-corporate-tax-121216-en.pdf | title=TAX BATTLES The dangerous global Race to the Bottom on Corporate Tax | publisher=Oxfam|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Financial Secrecy Index]] (although the FSI is a list of "financial secrecy jurisdictions", and not specifically tax havens).{{efn|name=FSI}}
| Non–governmental, Quantitative:  by following an objective quantitative approach, they can rank the relative scale of individual havens; the best known are:
* Tax rate – focus on ''effective tax rates'', like the [[James R. Hines Jr.#Hines-Rice 1994 list|Hines–Rice 1994 list]],&lt;ref name="h3"/&gt; and the [[Dhammika Dharmapala#Dharmapala-Hines 2009 list|Dharmapala–Hines 2009 list]].&lt;ref name="dhar"/&gt; (Hines and Dharmapala avoided ''rankings'' in these lists).
* Connections – focus on ''legal connections'', either [[Bureau van Dijk|Orbis connections]] like CORPNET's 2017 [[Conduit and Sink OFCs]], or subsidiary connections like the [[Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy#ITEP 2017 tax haven list (by quantum of connections)|ITEP Connections 2017 list]].&lt;ref name="ITEP"/&gt;
* Quantum – focus on ''profits shifted'', either [[BEPS]] flows like the [[Gabriel Zucman#Zucman-Tørsløv-Wier 2018 list|Zucman–Tørsløv–Wier 2018 list]],&lt;ref name="gbz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zuc10"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/corporations-push-profits-into-tax-havens-as-countries-struggle-in-pursuit-study-says-1528634659|title=Zucman:Corporations Push Profits Into Corporate Tax Havens as Countries Struggle in Pursuit, Gabrial Zucman Study Says|quote=The new research draws on data from countries such as Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands that hadn’t previously been collected.|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]] flows like the [[James R.

}}

Research also highlights [[Corporate haven#Proxy tests|proxy indicators]], of which the two most prominent are:
{{ordered list|type=lower-roman
| U.S. [[tax inversion]]s – A basic "sense-check" of a tax haven is whether individuals or corporates relocate there to avoid taxes (i.e. why accusations of the U.S. as a tax haven are not considered credible).  While individual relocations are hard to track, corporations are easier.  The top 3 destinations for all U.S. corporate [[tax inversion]]s since 1982 are: Ireland (#1), Bermuda (#2) and the U.K. (#3);&lt;ref name="bbb"/&gt;
| [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP-per-capita]] tables – Another effective "sense–check" of a tax haven is distortion in its GDP/GNP from the [[Corporate haven#IP-based BEPS tools|IP–based BEPS tools]] and  [[Corporate haven#Debt-based BEPS tools|Debt–based BEPS tools]].

}}

===Top 10 tax havens===

The post–2010 rise in quantitative techniques of identifying tax havens has seen a consistency amongst the ten largest tax havens.  [[Dhammika Dharmapala|Dharmapala]] notes that as corporate BEPS flows dominate tax haven activity, these are mostly corporate tax havens.&lt;ref name="be"/&gt;  Nine of the top ten tax havens in [[Gabriel Zucman]]'s June 2018 study appear in the top ten lists of the two other quantitative studies since 2010.

All five of the top 5 Sink OFCs are represented, although Jersey only appears in the Hines 2010 list.

The studies capture the rise of Ireland and Singapore, both major regional headquarters for some of the largest BEPS tool users, Apple, Google and Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/commercial-property/tech-giants-eating-up-dublin-s-office-market-1.3455742|title=Tech giants eating up Dublin’s office market|publisher=Irish Times|date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/10/googles-new-apac-headquarters-in-singapore-is-a-blend-of-office-building-and-tech-campus.html|title=Google's new APAC headquarters in Singapore is a blend of office building and tech campus|publisher=CNBC|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/facebook-s-singapore-office-will-make-you-want-to-quit-your-job-a6675511.html|title=Facebook’s Singapore APAC Headquarters|publisher=The Independent|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Q1 2015, Apple completed the largest BEPS action in history, when it shifted USD 300 billion of IP to Ireland, which Nobel-prize economist [[Paul Krugman]] called "[[leprechaun economics]]".

In September 2018, using TCJA repatriation tax data, the [[National Bureau of Economic Research|NBER]] listed the ''key tax havens'' as: "Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Switzerland, Singapore, Bermuda and [the] Caribbean havens".&lt;ref name="zucwright"/&gt;&lt;ref name="japantimes"/&gt;

(*) Appears as a top ten tax haven in all three lists; 9 major tax havens meet this criterion, ''Ireland, Singapore, Switzerland and the Netherlands (the Conduit OFCs), and the Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, Luxembourg, Hong Kong and Bermuda (the Sink OFCs)''.&lt;br&gt;
(†) Also appears as one of 5 [[Conduit and Sink OFCs#Conduit OFC|Conduit OFC]] (Ireland, Singapore, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom), in CORPNET's 2017 research; or&lt;br&gt;
(‡) Also appears as a Top 5 [[Conduit and Sink OFCs#Sink OFC|Sink OFC]] (British Virgin Islands, Luxemburg, Hong Kong, Jersey, Bermuda), in CORPNET's 2017 research.&lt;br&gt;
(Δ) Identified on the first, and largest, OECD 2000 list of 35 tax havens (the OECD list only contained Trinidad &amp; Tobago by 2017).&lt;ref name="OECDh"/&gt;

The strongest consensus amongst academics regarding the world's largest tax havens is therefore: Ireland, Singapore, Switzerland and the Netherlands (the major Conduit OFCs), and the Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, Luxembourg, Hong Kong and Bermuda (the major Sink OFCs), with the United Kingdom (a major Conduit OFC) still in transformation.

Of these ten major havens, all except the United Kingdom and the Netherlands featured on the original [[James R. Hines Jr.#Hines-Rice 1994 list|Hines–Rice 1994 list]].  The United Kingdom was not a tax haven in 1994, and Hines estimated the Netherlands's effective tax rate in 1994 at over 20% (he estimated Ireland’s at 4%). Four of them, Ireland, Singapore, Switzerland (3 of the 5 top Conduit OFCs), and Hong Kong (a top 5 Sink OFC), featured in the Hines–Rice 1994 list's ''7 major tax havens'' sub–category; highlighting a lack of progress in curtailing tax havens.&lt;ref name="h3"/&gt; 

In terms of [[Corporate haven#Proxy tests|proxy indicators]], this list, excluding Canada, contains all seven of the countries that received more than one US [[tax inversion]] since 1982 (see [[Corporate haven#Bloomberg Corporate tax inversions|here]])&lt;ref name="bbb"/&gt;. In addition, six of these major tax havens are in the top 15 [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita#Distorted GDP-per-capita for tax havens|GDP-per-capita]], and of the four others, three of them, the Caribbean locations, are not included in IMF-World Bank GDP-per-capita tables.

In a June 2018 joint IMF report into the effect of BEPS flows on global economic data, eight of the above (excluding Switzerland and the United Kingdon) were cited as the world’s leading tax havens.&lt;ref name="imfx"/&gt;

===Top 20 tax havens===

The longest list from ''Non–governmental, Quantitative'' research on tax havens is the University of Amsterdam CORPNET July 2017 [[Conduit and Sink OFCs]] study, at 29 (5 Conduit OFCs and 25 Sink OFCs).  The following are the 20 largest (5 Conduit OFCs and 15 Sink OFCs), which reconcile with other main lists as follows:

(*) Appears in as a {{slink|#Top 10 tax haven}} in all three quantitative lists, Hines 2010, ITEP 2017 and Zucman 2018 (above); all nine such {{slink|#Top 10 tax haven}}s are listed below.&lt;br&gt;
(♣) Appears on the [[James R. Hines Jr.#Hines 2010 list|James Hines 2010 list]] of 52 tax havens; seventeen of the twenty locations below, are on the James Hines 2010 list.&lt;br&gt;
(Δ) Identified on the largest OECD 2000 list of 35 tax havens (the OECD list only contained Trinidad &amp; Tobago by 2017); only four locations below were ever on an OECD list.&lt;ref name="OECDh"/&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
(↕) Identified on the European Union's first 2017 list of 17 tax havens;&lt;ref name="eu havens"/&gt; only one location below is on the EU 2017 list.&lt;br&gt;

===Broad lists of tax havens===

Post–2010 research on tax havens is focused on quantitative analysis (which can be ranked), and tends to ignore very small tax havens where data is limited as the haven is used for individual tax avoidance rather than corporate tax avoidance.  The last credible broad unranked list of global tax havens is the [[James R. Hines Jr.#Hines 2010 list|James Hines 2010 list]] of 52 tax havens.  It is shown below but expanded to 55 to include havens identified in the July 2017 [[Conduit and Sink OFCs]] study that were not considered havens in 2010, namely the United Kingdom, Taiwan, and Curaçao.  The James Hines 2010 list contains 34 of the original 35 OCED tax havens;&lt;ref name="OECDh"/&gt; and compared with the {{slink|#Top 10 tax havens}} and {{slink|#Top 20 tax havens}} above, show OECD processes focus on the compliance of tiny havens.

===Unusual cases===

U.S. dedicated entities:

* [[Delaware]] ([[United States]]), a unique "onshore" specialised haven with very strong secrecy laws.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Wayne (2012): [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/business/how-delaware-thrives-as-a-corporate-tax-haven.html How Delaware Thrives as a Corporate Tax Haven]; ''The New York Times'', 30 Jun. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Puerto Rico]] ([[United States]]), almost a [[corporate tax haven]] "concession" by the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;Reuven S. Avi-Yonah (2012): Statement to Congress; University of Michigan School of Law, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, U.S. Congress, 20 Sep. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but which the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] mostly removes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/20/news/economy/puerto-rico-tax-bill/index.html|title=Puerto Rico Governor: GOP tax bill is 'serious setback' for the island|publisher=CNN| date=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major sovereign States which feature on financial secrecy lists (e.g. the [[Financial Secrecy Index]]), but not on [[corporate tax haven]] or traditional tax haven lists, are:

* United States – noted for secrecy, per the [[Financial Secrecy Index]], (see [[United States as a tax haven]]); makes a "controversial" appearance on some lists.&lt;ref name="Drucker2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-27/the-world-s-favorite-new-tax-haven-is-the-united-states|title=The World’s Favorite New Tax Haven Is the United States|author=Jesse Drucker|date=27 January 2016|work=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Germany]] – similar to the U.S., Germany can be included on lists for its tax secrecy, per the Financial Secrecy Index&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.handelsblatt.com/finance/a-german-tax-haven-626845|title=A German Tax Haven|website=Handelsblatt Global|date=25 October 2016|first = Konrad|last = Fischer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither the U.S. or Germany have appeared on any tax haven lists by the main academic leaders in tax haven research, namely: [[James R. Hines Jr.]], [[Dhammika Dharmapala]] or [[Gabriel Zucman]].  There are no known cases of foreign firms executing [[tax inversion]]s to the U.S. or Germany for tax purposes, a basic sense-check of a [[corporate tax haven]].&lt;ref name="bbb"/&gt;

===Former tax havens===

* [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] formerly had a reputation as the only tax haven in the [[Middle East]]. However, this changed after the [[Intra Bank]] crash of 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945606-1,00.html |title= Lebanon: Election Under Fire|work =Time Magazine|date=17 May 1976|accessdate = |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the subsequent political and military deterioration of Lebanon dissuaded foreign use of the country as a tax haven.
* [[Liberia]] had a prosperous [[flag of convenience|ship registration industry]]. The series of violent and bloody [[First Liberian Civil War|civil wars]] in the 1990s and early 2000s severely damaged confidence in the country. The fact that the ship registration business still continues is partly a testament to its early success, and partly a testament to moving the national shipping registry to New York, United States.
* [[Tangier]] had a short existence as a tax haven in the period between the end of effective control by the Spanish in 1945 until it was formally reunited with [[Morocco]] in 1956.

While incomplete, and with the limitations discussed below, the available statistics nonetheless indicate that [[offshore banking]] is a very sizable activity. The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] estimated in 2007 that capital held offshore amounted to between $5 trillion and $7 trillion, making up approximately 6–8% of total global investments under management.&lt;ref name="Places in the sun"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8695139 "Places in the sun"], ''The Economist'', 22 February 2007.  This may be a slight underestimate: according to the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, Caymanian licensed banks held US$1.725 trillion in deposits as of September 2011{{cite web|url=http://www.cimoney.com.ky/stats_reg_ent/stats_reg_ent.aspx?id=200&amp;ekmensel=e2f22c9a_14_72_200_6|title=Banking statistics|accessdate=2013-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303181908/http://www.cimoney.com.ky/stats_reg_ent/stats_reg_ent.aspx?id=200&amp;ekmensel=e2f22c9a_14_72_200_6|archive-date=3 March 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent study by [[Gabriel Zucman]] of the [[London School of Economics]] estimated the amount of global cross-border wealth held in tax havens (including the Netherlands and Luxembourg as tax havens for this purpose) at US$7.6 trillion, of which US$2.46 trillion was held in Switzerland alone.&lt;ref name=Zucman /&gt;&lt;ref name="zucc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/08/tax-havens-dodging-theft-multinationals-avoiding-tax|title=The desperate inequality behind global tax dodging|publisher=The Guardian| date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Tax Justice Network]] (an anti-tax haven pressure group) estimated in 2012 that capital held offshore amounted to between $21 trillion and $32 trillion (between 24–32% of total global investments),&lt;ref name="TOI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-07-22/news/32788549_1_tax-havens-tax-justice-network-investment-bank| title=13 trillion pounds in offshore tax havens: Report | publisher=The Times of India | date=22 July 2012 | accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/07/22/uk-offshore-wealth-idUKBRE86L03W20120722?feedType=RSS&amp;feedname=topNews | title=Super rich hold $32 trillion in offshore havens | publisher=Reuters | date=22 July 2012 | accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18944097 |title=Tax havens: Super-rich 'hiding' at least $21tn | publisher=BBC | date=22 July 2012 | accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although those estimates have been challenged.&lt;ref name="Gordon &amp; Morriss" /&gt;

In 2000, the [[International Monetary Fund]] calculated based on [[Bank for International Settlements]] data that for selected [[offshore financial centre]]s, [[balance sheet|on-balance sheet]] cross-border assets held in offshore financial centres reached a level of $4.6 trillion at the end of June 1999 (about 50 percent of total cross-border assets).  Of that $4.6 trillion, $0.9 trillion was held in the Caribbean, $1 trillion in Asia, and most of the remaining $2.7 trillion accounted for by the major [[international financial centre|international finance centre]]s (IFCs), namely London, the U.S. IBFs, and the Japanese offshore market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/np/mae/oshore/2000/eng/back.htm "Offshore Financial Centers"], International Monetary Fund background paper, 23 June 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[U.S. Department of Treasury]] estimated that in 2011 the Caribbean Banking Centers, which include Bahamas, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Netherlands Antilles and Panama, held almost $2 trillion in United States debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Pages/ticliab.aspx |title=U.S. Banking Liabilities to Foreigners. |publisher=Treasury.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of this, approximately US$1.4 trillion is estimated to be held in the Cayman Islands alone.&lt;ref name="Places in the sun"/&gt;

The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' in a study of 60 large U.S. companies found that they deposited $166 billion in offshore accounts in 2012, sheltering over 40% of their profits from U.S. taxes.&lt;ref name="ThurmLinebaugh" /&gt; Similarly, Desai, Foley and Hines found that: "in 1999, 59% of U.S. firms with significant foreign operations had affiliates in tax haven countries", although they did not define "significant" for this purpose.&lt;ref name="desai"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272705001350 |author1=[[Mihir A.

The GAO did not review the companies' transactions to independently verify that the subsidiaries helped the companies reduce their tax burden, but said only that historically the purpose of such subsidiaries is to cut tax costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Report Finds Major U.S. Companies Have Offshore Tax Havens |author=Carol D.

James Henry, former chief economist at consultants [[McKinsey &amp; Company]], in his report for the Tax Justice Network gives an indication of the amount of money that is sheltered by wealthy individuals in tax havens. The report estimated conservatively that a fortune of $21 trillion is stashed away in off-shore accounts with $9.8 trillion alone by the top tier—less than 100,000 people—who each own financial assets of $30 million or more. The report's author indicated that this hidden money results in a "huge" lost tax revenue—a "black hole" in the economy—and many countries would become creditors instead of being debtors if the money of their tax evaders would be taxed.&lt;ref name="TOI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

===Lost tax revenue===
[[File:HMRC offshore evasion poster February 2014.jpg|thumbnail|Poster issued by the British tax authorities to counter illegal offshore tax evasion.]]
The Tax Justice Network estimated in 2012 that global tax revenue lost to tax havens was circa $190 to $255 billion per year (assuming a 3% [[capital gains]] rate, a 30% [[capital gains tax]] rate, and $21 to $32 trillion hidden in tax havens.&lt;ref name=tjn12 /&gt; The [[Gabriel Zucman|Zucman]] study uses different methodology, but also estimates $190 billion in lost revenue.&lt;ref name=Zucman/&gt;

The UN Economic Commission for Africa estimates that illegal financial flows cost the continent around $50 billion per year. The [[OECD]] estimates that two-thirds ($30 billion) occur from tax avoidance and evasion from non-African firms.&lt;ref name="D+C"&gt;{{cite news |title=Misleading index|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/corruption-africa-preconceptions-and-hidden-perpetrators|author= Nico Beckert|work=D+C, development and cooperation |date=21 February 2017 |accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The avoidance of taxation by international corporations through legal and illegal methods stifles development in African countries. The [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) will be difficult to obtain if these losses persist.&lt;ref name="E+Z"&gt;{{cite news |title=Missing Billions|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/international-oil-gas-and-mining-corporations-are-cheating-developing-countries-out-tax|author=Nico Beckert|work=D+C, development and cooperation |date=28 December 2017 |accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2016 a massive data leak known as the "[[Panama Papers]]" cast some doubt on the size of previous estimates of lost revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/04/10/david-camerons-panama-papers-show-how-little-offshore-tax-dodging-is-going-on/#4d465ae92a0d |title=David Cameron's Panama Papers Show How Little Offshore Tax Dodging Is Going On |publisher=Forbes |date=10 April 2016 | quote=We’ve got evidence of offshore structures, most assuredly we have. But not only haven’t we got any evidence of tax dodging all the evidence we do have points to less tax dodging than many think.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the tax policy director of the [[Chartered Institute of Taxation]] expressed skepticism over the accuracy of the figures.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk" /&gt; If true, those sums would amount to approximately 5 to 8 times the [[Circulation (currency)|total amount of currency presently in circulation]] in the world. [[Daniel J. Mitchell]] of the [[Cato Institute]] says that the report also assumes, when considering notional lost tax revenue, that 100% money deposited offshore is evading payment of tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesovereigninvestor.com/2012/07/30/fighting-anti-tax-haven-demagoguery-on-cnn/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227214302/http://thesovereigninvestor.com/2012/07/30/fighting-anti-tax-haven-demagoguery-on-cnn/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-12-27|title=Fighting Anti-Tax Haven Demagoguery on CNN|date=2012-07-30|accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, research commissioned from [[Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu|Deloitte]] for the Foot Review of British Offshore Financial Centres said that much less tax had been lost to tax havens than previously had been thought. The report indicated "We estimate the total UK corporation tax potentially lost to avoidance activities to be up to £2 billion per annum, although it could be much lower." An earlier report by the U.K. [[Trades Union Congress]], concluded that tax avoidance by the 50 largest companies in the [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE 100]] was depriving the [[UK Treasury]] of approximately £11.8 billion.&lt;ref name="The Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article6896141.ece|title=Tax haven report lays emphasis on vital role of Crown Dependencies|author=''[[The Times]]''|date=2009-10-30|accessdate=2009-11-02 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also stressed that [[British Crown Dependencies]] make a "significant contribution to the liquidity of the UK market". In the second quarter of 2009, they provided net funds to banks in the UK totaling $323 billion (£195 billion), of which $218 billion came from [[Jersey]], $74 billion from [[Guernsey]] and $40 billion from the [[Isle of Man]].&lt;ref name="The Times"/&gt;

The Tax Justice Network reports that this system is "basically designed and operated"  by a group of highly paid specialists from the world’s largest private banks (led by [[UBS]], [[Credit Suisse]], and [[Goldman Sachs]]),   law offices, and accounting firms and tolerated by international organizations such as Bank for International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the OECD, and the [[G20]]. The amount of money hidden away has significantly increased since 2005, sharpening the divide between the super-rich and the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="TOI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

The [[World Bank]], in its 2019 [[World Development Report]] on the future of work [http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2019 supports] increased government efforts to curb tax avoidance in order to create fiscal space for human capital investments.

===Inflated GDP-per-capita===

[[File:Paul Krugman at the German National Library in Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|Nobel Prize-winning economist [[Paul Krugman]] called the 2015 restatement of Ireland's national accounts, as a result of the Q1 2015 restructuring of Apple's BEPS tools in Ireland, "[[leprechaun economics]]", due to the extreme levels of distortion that BEPS tools were having on Irish GDP/GNP.  In February 2017, Ireland replaced GDP/GNP with "[[Modified gross national income|Modified GNI]]".]]

Tax havens, traditional and corporate, have high [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP-per-capita]] rankings, because the haven's national economic statistics are artificially inflated by the [[BEPS]] accounting flows that add to the haven's GDP (and even GNP), but are not taxable in the haven.&lt;ref name="imfx"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2018/06/inside-the-world-of-global-tax-havens-and-offshore-banking/damgaard.htm|title=Piercing the Veil of Tax Havens |first1 = Jannick |last1=Damgaard|first2=Thomas|last2= Elkjaer|first3=Niels |last3=Johannesen | journal=International Monetary Fund: [[Finance &amp; Development|Finance &amp; Development Quarterly]]|quote=The eight major pass-through economies—the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Hong Kong SAR, the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland, and Singapore—host more than 85 percent of the world’s investment in special purpose entities, which are often set up for tax reasons.|volume=55|issue =2|date= June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qqtz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1300880/tax-havens-mean-40-of-foreign-direct-investments-are-artificial/|title=How tax havens turn economic statistics into nonsense|publisher=Quartz|date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the largest facilitators of BEPS flows, corporate-focused tax havens, in particular, make up most of the top 10-15 GDP-per-capita tables, excluding oil and gas nations (see table below).  Research into tax havens suggest a high GDP-per-capita score, in the absence of material natural resources, as an important [[Corporate haven#Proxy tests|proxy indicator]] of a tax haven.&lt;ref name="imf"&gt;IMF working paper: [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2007/wp0787.pdf Concept of Offshore Financial Centers: In Search of an Operational Definition; Ahmed Zoromé; IMF Working Paper 07/87; April 1, 2007].

Retrieved on 2011-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the core of the FSF-IMF definition of an [[offshore financial centre]] is a country where the BEPS flows are out of proportion to the size of the indigenous economy.  Apple's Q1 2015 "[[leprechaun economics]]" BEPS transaction in Ireland was a dramatic example, which caused Ireland to abandon its GDP and GNP metrics in February 2017, in favour of a new metric, [[modified gross national income]], or GNI*.

This artificial inflation of GDP can attract excess foreign capital, who misprice their capital by using a Debt-to-GDP metric for the haven, thus producing phases of stronger economic growth.&lt;ref name="mich"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/39181/921.pdf?sequence=1|title=Do Tax Havens Flourish|author=[[James R.

===Importance of governance===

In several research papers, [[James R. Hines Jr.]] showed that tax havens were typically small but well-governed nations and that being a tax haven had brought significant prosperity.&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mich"/&gt;  In 2009, Hines and Dharmapala suggested that roughly 15% of countries are tax havens, but they wondered why more countries had not become tax havens given the observable economic prosperity it could bring.&lt;ref name="dhar"/&gt;

{{quote|There are roughly 40 major tax havens in the world today, but the sizable apparent economic returns to becoming a tax haven raise the question of why there are not more.|source=Which Countries Become Tax Havens? (2009)&lt;ref name="dhar"/&gt;|author=[[Dhammika Dharmapala]], [[James R. Hines Jr.]]}}

Hines and Dharmapala concluded that governance was a major issue for smaller countries in trying to become tax havens.  Only countries with strong governance and legislation which was trusted by foreign corporates and investors, would become tax havens.&lt;ref name="dhar"/&gt;  Hines and Dharmapala's positive view on the financial benefits of becoming a tax haven, as well as being two of the major academic leaders into tax haven research, put them in sharp conflict with non-governmental organisations advocating ''tax justice'', such as the Tax Justice Network, who accused them as promoting tax avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://taxjustice.blogspot.com/2010/03/jim-hines-fails-to-defend-secrecy.html|title=Jim Hines fails to defend secrecy jurisdictions|publisher=[[Tax Justice Network]]|date=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ns1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treasureislands.org/the-arguments/|title=Tax havens’ arguments in their defence – and why they are wrong |quote=First, many these claims rest heavily on work done by James Hines of the University of Michigan and a few others – research that is fatally flawed. |author=[[Nicholas Shaxson]]|date=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ns2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-tax-havens/2016/04/15/76d001d2-0255-11e6-b823-707c79ce3504_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.9d79e83386b9|title=Five myths about tax havens|quote=According to economics professor James Hines, tax havens serve as healthy competition for high-tax countries, nudging them toward less-restrictive financial policy.

An unexpected conclusion of the original 1994 [[James R. Hines Jr.#Tax haven research|Hines-Rice paper]], and re-affirmed by others,&lt;ref name="praise"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9fa3/80280acbdf02a218407dc38cf909d0260b6e.pdf|title=In praise of tax havens: International tax planning and foreign direct investment|journal=[[European Economic Review]]|volume=54|issue=1|pages=82-95|date=January 2010|author1=Qing Hong|author2=Michael Smart}}&lt;/ref&gt; was that: ''low foreign tax rates [from tax havens] ultimately enhance U.S. tax collections''.&lt;ref name="h3"/&gt; Hines noted that as a result of paying no foreign taxes by using tax havens, U.S. multinationals had avoided building up foreign tax credits that would reduce their ultimate U.S. tax liability.  Hines returned to this finding several times, and in his 2010 {{slink|#Important papers on tax havens}}, ''Treasure Islands'', where he showed how U.S. multinationals used tax havens and BEPS tools to avoid Japanese taxes on their Japanese investments, noted that this was being confirmed by other empirical research at a company-level.&lt;ref name="dryng"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00346.x|title=Using Financial Accounting Data to Examine the Effect of Foreign Operations Located in Tax Havens and Other Countries on US Multinational Firms' Tax Rates|author1=Scott Dyreng|author2=Bradley P.

In 1996, the IRS issued regulations that enabled U.S. multinationals to avoid some of these rules by electing to treat their foreign subsidiaries as if they were not corporations but disregarded entities for tax purposes. This move is called “checking the box” because that is all that needs to be done on IRS form 8832 to make it work and use Irish BEPS tools on non-U.S. revenues was a compromise to keep U.S. multinationals from leaving the U.S. (page 10.)&lt;ref name="zucwright"/&gt;}} rules, and U.S. hostility to OECD attempts in curbing Ireland's BEPS tools,{{efn|The U.S. refused to sign the [[BEPS#OECD BEPS Project|OECD BEPS Multilateral Instrument]] ("MLI") on the 24 November 2016.}}&lt;ref name="crs2"/&gt; and why, in spite of public disclosure of tax avoidance by firms such as Google, Facebook, and Apple, with Irish BEPS tools, [[Ireland as a tax haven#Apparent contradictions|little has been done by the U.S. to stop them]].&lt;ref name="praise"/&gt;

''Tax justice'' groups interpreted Hines' research as the U.S. engaging in tax competition with higher-tax nations (i.e. the U.S. exchequer earning excess taxes at the expense of others).  The 2017 TCJA seems to support this view with the U.S. exchequer being able to levy a 15.5% repatriation tax on over $1 trillion of untaxed offshore profits built up by U.S. multinationals with BEPS tools from non-U.S. revenues.  Had these U.S. multinationals paid taxes on these non-U.S. profits in the countries in which they were earned, there would have been the little further liability to U.S. taxation.  Research by Zucman and Wright (2018) estimated that most of the TCJA repatriation benefit went to the shareholders of U.S. multinationals, and not the U.S. exchequer.&lt;ref name="zucwright"/&gt;{{efn|Zucman and Wright's analysis assumed that U.S. multinationals were going to pay a U.S. 35% rate eventually (e.g. they would repatriate their untaxed offshore cash at some stage in the future); if the assumption is made that they were going to permanently leave their offshore cash outside of the U.S., then the U.S. exchequer was the main beneficiary}}

Academics who study tax havens, attribute Washington's support of U.S. multinational use of tax havens to a "[[Ireland as a tax haven#Source of contradictions|political compromise]]" between Washington, and even other higher-tax OECD nations, to compensate for the shortcomings of the U.S. "worldwide" tax system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL34115.pdf|title=Reform of U.S. International Taxation: Alternatives|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|author=Jane G.

In 2016, Hines, with German tax academics, showed that German multinationals make little use of tax havens because their tax regime, a "territorial" system, removes any need for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2831&amp;context=articles|title=Multinational Firms and Tax Havens|author1=[[James R.

===Promoters of global growth===
[[File:Joel Slemrod C-SPAN.jpg|thumb|[[Joel Slemrod]] testifying to the [[President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform]] (2005).  Slemrod rejected Hines, Desai, and Dharmapala's observations, that tax havens might support global economic growth, instead calling tax havens ''parasitic''.&lt;ref name="slemrod"/&gt;]]  

A controversial area of research into tax havens is the suggestion that tax havens actually promote global economic growth by solving perceived issues in the tax regimes of higher-taxed nations (e.g. the above discussion on the U.S. "worldwide" tax system as an example).  Important academic leaders in tax haven research, such as Hines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/tax-havens-and-treasure-hunts/|title=Tax havens and treasure hunts|publisher=[[New York Times]]|quote=Some economists champion tax havens. In an article in the Journal of Economic Perspectives published last fall (also titled “Treasure Islands”), James R. Hines Jr. of the University of Michigan argued that they contribute to financial market competition, encourage investment in high-tax countries and promote economic growth.  Like many economists, Professor Hines expresses far more confidence in the market than in the state. He worries more about possible overtaxation than about undertaxation of corporate income. He does not enage with such concepts as “tax justice.”|date=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dharmapala,&lt;ref name="dhh"/&gt; and others,&lt;ref name="praise"/&gt; cite evidence that, in certain cases, tax havens appear to promote economic growth in higher-tax countries, and can support beneficial hybrid tax regimes of higher taxes on domestic activity, but lower taxes on international sourced capital or income:

{{quote| The effect of tax havens on economic welfare in high tax countries is unclear, though the availability of tax havens appears to stimulate economic activity in nearby high-tax countries.|author=[[James R. Hines Jr.]] |source="Abstract: Tax Havens" (2007)&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt;}}

{{quote|Tax havens change the nature of tax competition among other countries, very possibly permitting them to sustain high domestic tax rates that are effectively mitigated for mobile international investors whose transactions are routed through tax havens. [..] In fact, countries that lie close to tax havens have exhibited more rapid real income growth than have those further away, possibly in part as a result of financial flows and their market effects.|author=[[James R. Hines Jr.]] |source="Treasure Islands" p. 107 (2010)&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;}}

The most cited paper on research into [[offshore financial centres]] ("OFCs"),&lt;ref name="respecOFC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/cgi-bin/htsearch?form=extended&amp;wm=wrd&amp;dt=range&amp;ul=&amp;q=tax+haven&amp;cmd=Search%21&amp;wf=4BFF&amp;s=C&amp;db=&amp;de=|title=IDEAS/RePEc Database|quote=Offshore Financial Centres by Most Cited}}&lt;/ref&gt; a closely related term to tax havens, noted the positive and negative aspects of OFCs on neighbouring high-tax, or source, economies, and marginally came out in favour of OFCs.&lt;ref name="RoseSpiegel"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w12044.pdf|title=Offshore Financial Centers: Parasites or Symbionts?|author1=Andrew K.

{{quote|CONCLUSION: Using both bilateral and multilateral samples, we find empirically that successful offshore financial centers encourage bad behavior in source countries since they facilitate tax evasion and money laundering [...] Nevertheless, offshore financial centers created to facilitate undesirable activities can still have unintended positive consequences.

Spiegel, "Offshore Financial Centers: Parasites or Symbionts?", [[The Economic Journal]], (September 2007)&lt;ref name="RoseSpiegel"/&gt;}}

However, other notable tax academics strongly dispute these views, such as work by [[Joel Slemrod|Slemrod]] and Wilson, who in their {{slink|#Important papers on tax havens}}, label tax havens as ''parasitic'' to jurisdictions with normal tax regimes, that can damage their economies.&lt;ref name="slemrod"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/teaching/SlemrodWilson09.pdf|title=Tax competition with parasitic tax havens|date=6 September 2009|journal=[[Journal of Public Economics]]|author1=[[Joel Slemrod]]|author2=John D. Wilson|quote=Although a previous literature has modelled tax havens as a benign phenomenon that helps high-tax countries reduce the negative impact of their own suboptimal domestic tax policies, there is considerable concern that the havens are “parasitic” on the tax revenues of the non-haven countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, ''tax justice'' campaign groups have been equally critical of Hines, and others, in these views.&lt;ref name="ns1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ns2"/&gt;  Research in June 2018 by the IMF showed that much of the [[foreign direct investment]] ("FDI") that came from tax havens into higher-tax countries, had really originated from the higher-tax country,&lt;ref name="imfx"/&gt; and for example, that the largest source of FDI into the United Kingdom, was actually from the United Kingdom, but invested via tax havens.&lt;ref name="quartz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1300880/tax-havens-mean-40-of-foreign-direct-investments-are-artificial/|title=How tax havens turn economic statistics into nonsense|date=11 June 2018|author=Max de Haldevang|publisher=[[Quartz (publication)]]|quote=For example, according to the UK Treasury, on the surface it looks like Britain’s second-biggest investor is the Netherlands.

The boundaries with wider contested economic theories on the effects of corporate taxation on economic growth, and whether there should be corporate taxes, are easy to blur.  Other major academic leaders in tax haven research, such as [[Gabriel Zucman|Zucman]], highlight the injustice of tax havens and see the effects as lost income for the development of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/08/tax-havens-dodging-theft-multinationals-avoiding-tax|title=The desperate inequality behind global tax dodging|publisher=The Guardian|author=Gabriel Zucman|date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It remains a controversial area with advocates on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-07-25/fighting-corporate-tax-avoidance-can-kill-economic-growth|title=Fighting tax dodgers can kill economic growth|publisher=Bloomberg|date=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==

{{cleanup section|date=September 2018|reason=list of structures seems out of date and not reflective of current structures}}

The way tax havens operate can be viewed in the following principal contexts:&lt;ref name=Tolley&gt;''Tolley's Offshore Service'' (2006), {{ISBN|1-4057-1568-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}}

===Personal residency===

Since the early 20th century, wealthy individuals from high-tax countries have sought to relocate themselves in low-tax countries. In most countries in the world, residence is the primary basis of taxation—see [[tax residence]]. The low-tax country chosen may levy no, or only very low, income tax and may not levy [[capital gains tax]], or [[inheritance tax]]. Individuals are normally unable to return to their previous higher-tax country for more than a few days a year without reverting their tax residence to their former country. They are sometimes referred to as [[tax exile]]s.&lt;ref name=Tolley/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}}

===Corporate residency===
{{See also|Tax inversion}}

Corporations can establish subsidiary corporations and/or regional [[headquarters]] in corporate tax havens for tax planning purposes.  Where a corporate moves their legal headquarters to a haven, it is known as a corporate tax inversion.&lt;ref name="bbb"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/tax-inversion-tracker/|title=Tracking Tax Runaways|publisher=Bloomberg News|date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reuven S. Avi-Yonah (2002): For Haven's Sake: Reflections on Inversion Transactions; University of Michigan Law School, Tax Notes, Vol. 95 no. 12, 17 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of [[intellectual property]], or IP, as a major [[Corporate haven#IP-Based BEPS tools|BEPS tax tool]], has meant that corporates can achieve much of the benefits of a tax inversion, without needing to move their headquarters.  Apple's $300 billion quasi-inversion to Ireland in 2015 (see [[leprechaun economics]]) is a good example of this.

===Asset holding===
Asset holding involves utilizing an [[offshore trust]] or [[offshore company]], or a trust owning a company. The company or trust will be formed in one tax haven, and will usually be administered and resident in another. The function is to hold assets, which may consist of a portfolio of investments under management, trading companies or groups, physical assets such as [[real estate]] or valuable [[Personal property|chattels]]. The essence of such arrangements is that by changing the ownership of the assets into an entity which is not tax resident in the high-tax country, they cease to be taxable in that country.&lt;ref name=Tolley/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}}

Often the mechanism is employed to avoid a specific tax. For example, a wealthy [[testator]] could transfer his house into an offshore company; he can then settle the shares of the company on trust (with himself being a trustee with another trustee, whilst holding the beneficial [[life estate]]) for himself for life, and then to his daughter. On his death, the shares will automatically vest in the daughter, who thereby acquires the house, without the house having to go through [[probate]] and being assessed with inheritance tax.&lt;ref&gt;This is a simplistic example; in most sophisticated tax codes there are extensive provisions for catching "gifts" (such as a [[Declaration (law)|declaration of trust]]) made for a specified time preceding death.&lt;/ref&gt; Most countries assess inheritance tax, and all other taxes, on real estate within their jurisdiction, regardless of the nationality of the owner, so this would not work with a house in most countries. It is more likely to be done with intangible assets.&lt;ref name=Tolley/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}}

===Trading and other business activity===
{{see also|Corporate haven#IP-based BEPS tools|Corporate haven#Debt-based BEPS tools|Transfer mispricing}}
Many businesses which do not require a specific geographical location or extensive labor are set up in a country to minimize tax exposure. Perhaps the best illustration of this is the number of [[reinsurance]] companies which have migrated to [[Law of Bermuda|Bermuda]] over the years. Other examples include internet-based services and group finance companies. In the 1970s and 1980s corporate groups were known to form offshore entities for the purposes of "reinvoicing". These reinvoicing companies simply made a margin without performing any economic function, but as the margin arose in a tax-free country, it allowed the group to "skim" profits from the high-tax country. Most sophisticated tax codes now prevent [[transfer pricing]] schemes of this nature.&lt;ref name=Tolley/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}}

===Financial intermediaries===
Much of the economic activity in tax havens today consists of professional [[financial services]] such as [[mutual fund]]s, banking, [[life insurance]] and [[pension]]s. Generally, the funds are deposited with the intermediary in the low-tax country, and the intermediary then on-lends or invests the money in another location. Although such systems do not normally avoid tax in the principal customer's country, it enables financial service providers to provide international products without adding another layer of taxation. This has proved particularly successful in the area of [[offshore fund]]s. It has been estimated over 75% of the world's [[hedge fund]]s, probably the riskiest form of collective investment vehicle, are domiciled in the Cayman Islands, with nearly $1.1 trillion US [[Assets under management]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyii.com/article.asp?ArticleID=1039798&amp;LS=EMS73445 ''Institutional Investor''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310221113/http://www.dailyii.com/article.asp?ArticleID=1039798&amp;LS=EMS73445 |date=10 March 2007 }}, 15 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; although statistics in the hedge fund industry are notoriously speculative.

=== Anonymity and bearer shares ===
[[Bearer share]]s allow for anonymous ownership, and thus have been criticized for facilitating [[money laundering]] and [[tax evasion]]; these shares are also available in some OECD countries as well as in the U.S. state of Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;Gravelle JG. (2013). [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40623.pdf Tax Havens: International Tax Avoidance and Evasion]. CRS.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|7}} In a 2010 study in which the researcher attempted to set-up anonymous corporations found that 13 of the 17 attempts were successful in OECD countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, while only 4 of 28 attempts were successful in countries typically labeled tax havens.&lt;ref&gt;Sharman JC.

===Money and exchange control===
{{See also|Fixed exchange rate|Dollarization|Money laundering}}

Most tax havens have a double monetary control system, which distinguish residents from non-resident as well as foreign currency from the domestic, the local currency one. In general, residents are subject to monetary controls, but not non-residents. A company, belonging to a non-resident, when trading overseas is seen as non-resident in terms of exchange control. It is possible for a foreigner to create a company in a tax haven to trade internationally; the company’s operations will not be subject to exchange controls as long as it uses foreign currency to trade outside the tax haven. Tax havens usually have currency easily convertible or linked to an easily convertible currency. Most are convertible to [[US dollars]], [[euro]] or to [[pounds sterling]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Various developments==

=== U.S. Legislation ===
{{Main|Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act}}
The [[Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act]] (FATCA) was passed by the US Congress to stop the outflow of money from the country into tax haven bank accounts. With the strong backing of the [[Obama administration|Obama Administration]], Congress drafted the FATCA legislation and added it into the [[Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act]] (HIRE) signed into law by President Obama in March 2010.

FATCA requires foreign financial institutions (FFI) of broad scope – banks, stock brokers, hedge funds, pension funds, insurance companies, trusts – to report directly to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) all clients who are [[U.S. person]]s. Starting January 2014, FATCA requires FFIs to provide annual reports to the IRS on the name and address of each U.S. client, as well as the largest account balance in the year and total debits and credits of any account owned by a U.S. person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=242164,00.html | title=Treasury and IRS Issue Guidance Outlining Phased Implementation of FATCA Beginning in 2013 | author=[[U.S. Internal Revenue Service]] | date=2011-07-14 | accessdate=2011-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If an institution does not comply, the U.S. will impose a 30% withholding tax on all its transactions concerning U.S. securities, including the proceeds of sale of securities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In addition, FATCA requires any foreign company not listed on a stock exchange or any foreign partnership which has 10% U.S. ownership to report to the IRS the names and [[Taxpayer Identification Number|tax identification number]] (TIN) of any U.S. owner. FATCA also requires U.S. citizens and [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card holders]] who have foreign financial assets in excess of $50,000 to complete a new [[Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act|Form 8938]] to be filed with the [[IRS tax forms|1040 tax return]], starting with fiscal year 2010.&lt;ref&gt;"For most individual taxpayers, this means they will start filing Form 8938 with their 2011 income tax return to be filed this coming tax filing season."{{cite web | url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/corporations/article/0,,id=251217,00.html | title=Do I need to file Form 8938, "Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets"? | author=[[U.S. Internal Revenue Service]] | date=2012-01-25 | accessdate=2012-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The delay is indicative of a controversy over the feasibility of implementing the legislation as evidenced in this paper from the [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.piie.com/realtime/?p=2276| title=Gary Clyde Hufbauer: The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act: Imperial Overreach|  date=2011-07-22 | accessdate=2011-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unintended consequence of FATCA and its cost of compliance for non-US banks is that some non-US banks are refusing to serve American investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,803742,00.html | title=European banks stop serving American customers | author=Spiegel Online | date={{date|2011-12-14}} | accessdate={{date|2011-12-31}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Concerns have also been expressed that, because FATCA operates by imposing [[withholding taxes]] on U.S. investments, this will drive foreign financial institutions (particularly [[hedge funds]]) away from investing in the U.S. and thereby reduce [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] and [[capital inflows]] into the US.&lt;ref&gt;"Another approach would involve some global funds avoiding American assets entirely.

===Tax Justice Network Report 2012===
A 2012 report by the British [[Tax Justice Network]] estimated that between US$21 trillion and $32 trillion is sheltered from taxes in unreported tax havens worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-18944097|title=Tax havens: Super-rich 'hiding' at least $21tn|author=|date=|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; If such wealth earns 3% annually and such [[capital gains]] were taxed at 30%, it would generate between $190 billion and $280 billion in tax revenues, more than any other [[tax shelters|tax shelter]].&lt;ref name=tjn12&gt;Tax Justice Network (22 July 2012) [http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/The_Price_of_Offshore_Revisited_Presser_120722.pdf "Revealed: Global super-rich has at least $21 trillion hidden in secret tax havens"]&lt;/ref&gt; If such hidden offshore assets are considered, many countries with governments nominally in debt are shown to be net creditor nations.&lt;ref name=cbc12&gt;Canadian Broadcasting Co.

In fact, the US, UK and German authorities are doing a lot", and noting that if the figures were accurate "you would expect the havens to be more conspicuously wealthy than they are".  However, he also admitted that "I cannot disprove the figures at all, but they do seem staggering" {{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18944097|title=Tax havens: Super-rich 'hiding' at least $21tn|date=2012-07-22|accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another recent study estimated the amount of global offshore wealth at the smaller—but still sizable—figure of US$7.6 trillion.

===Bank data leak 2013===
Details of thousands of owners of offshore companies were published in April 2013 in a joint collaboration between ''[[The Guardian]]'' and the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/tax-haven-data-leak-names-names-raises-questions-172346691--finance.html|title=Tax haven data leak names names, raises questions|author=[[Yahoo!

===Liechtenstein banking scandal===
{{Main|2008 Liechtenstein tax affair}}
Germany announced in February 2008 that it had paid €4.2 million to {{Interlanguage link multi|Heinrich Kieber|de}},&lt;ref&gt;Mr Kieber seems to be an unlikely hero for law enforcement authorities. A convicted fraudster, reports indicate that after initially stealing the information, he [[blackmail]]ed the Liechtenstein authorities into reducing and dropping criminal charges against him relating to [[property fraud]] in Spain. However, before returning the disks he made copies which he later sold to foreign governments after he left the country. Further reports indicate that he now lives under a new name in Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/liechtenstein-s-shadowy-informant-tax-whistleblower-sold-data-to-the-us-a-537640.html|title=Liechtenstein's Shadowy Informant: Tax Whistleblower Sold Data to the US|first=SPIEGEL|last=Staff|date=25 February 2008|publisher=|via=Spiegel Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; a former data archivist of [[LGT Bank|LGT Treuhand]], a Liechtenstein bank, for a list of 1,250 customers of the bank and their accounts' details. Investigations and arrests followed relating to charges of illegal tax evasion. The German authorities shared the data with U.S. [[Revenue service|tax authorities]], but the British government paid a further £100,000 for the same data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/mar/02/tax.personalfinancenews|title=A journey from haven to hell|author=Nick Mathiason|work=the Guardian|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other governments, notably Denmark and Sweden, refused to pay for the information regarding it as stolen property.&lt;ref&gt;[[Denmark]]'s tax minister, [[Kristian Jensen]], said: "I think it's a moral problem to reward a criminal for some information that he stole... I don't like this and I don't think this ethic is the best way to ensure that taxes are paid correctly."&lt;/ref&gt; The Liechtenstein authorities subsequently accused the German authorities of espionage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Harry de Quetteville 12:01AM GMT 20 Feb 2008 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/02/20/wliech120.xml |title='&amp;#39;The Daily Telegraph'&amp;#39;, 26 February 2008 |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2008-02-20 |accessdate=2011-03-22 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, regardless of whether unlawful tax evasion was being engaged in, the incident has fuelled the perception among European governments and the press that tax havens provide facilities [[Bank secrecy|shrouded in secrecy]] designed to facilitate unlawful tax evasion, rather than legitimate tax planning and legal tax mitigation schemes. This in turn has led to a call for "crackdowns" on tax havens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2210944/germany-call-tax-haven|title=Germany to call for tax haven crackdown|website=Accountancyage.com|accessdate=29 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704212338/http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2210944/germany-call-tax-haven|archive-date=4 July 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the calls for such a crackdown are mere posturing or lead to more definitive activity by mainstream economies to restrict access to tax havens is yet to be seen. No definitive announcements or proposals have yet been made by the [[European Union]] or governments of the member states.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===German legislation===
[[Peer Steinbrück]], the former German finance minister, announced in January 2009 a plan to amend fiscal laws. New regulations would disallow that payments to companies in certain countries that shield money from disclosure rules to be declared as operational expenses. The effect of this would make banking in such states unattractive and expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,601859,00.html | title=Steinbrück forciert Kampf gegen Steuerparadiese |author=[[Der Spiegel]] | date=2009-01-17 | accessdate=2009-01-17 | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK Foot report===
In November 2009, Sir Michael Foot, a former Bank of England official and Bahamas bank inspector, delivered a report on the British [[Crown dependencies|Crown Dependencies]] and [[British Overseas Territories|Overseas Territories]] for [[HM Treasury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/press_98_09.htm|title=Michael Foot publishes final report|publisher=[[HM Treasury]]|date=2009-10-29|accessdate=2009-11-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118151755/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/press_98_09.htm|archivedate=18 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report indicated that while many of the territories "had a good story to tell", others needed to improve their abilities to detect and prevent financial crime. The report also stressed the view that narrow tax bases presented long term strategic risks and that the economies should seek to diversify and broaden their tax bases.&lt;ref name="bvi.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bvi.org.uk/government/pressrelease/michaelfootreview|title=Governor and Premier Welcome Michael Foot Review Conclusions|date=2009-10-30|accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It indicated that tax revenue lost by the UK government appeared to be much smaller than had previously been estimated (see above under [[Tax haven#Lost tax revenue|Lost tax revenue]]), and also stressed the importance of the liquidity provided by the territories to the United Kingdom. The Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories broadly welcomed the report.&lt;ref name="bvi.org.uk"/&gt; The pressure group [[Tax Justice Network]], unhappy with the findings, commented that "[a] weak man, born to be an apologist, has delivered a weak report."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taxjustice.blogspot.com/2009/10/foot-report.html|title=The Foot Report: a setback|publisher=[[Tax Justice Network]]|date=2009-10-29|accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2009 G-20 London summit|London G20 summit]] on 2 April 2009, [[G20]] countries agreed to define a [[blacklist]] for tax havens, to be segmented according to a four-tier system, based on compliance with an "internationally agreed tax standard."&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/02/g20-summit-tax-havens|title = G20 declares door shut on tax havens|work =The Guardian|date = 2 April 2009|first1= Nicholas|last1= Watt|first2= Larry|last2= Elliott |first3= Julian|last3= Borger|first4= Ian|last4= Black}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list as per 2 April 2009 can be viewed on the OECD website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/ctp/42497950.pdf |title=A Progress Report on The Jurisdictions Surveyed by The OECD Global Forum in Implementing The Internationally Agreed Tax Standard|date= 2009-04-02 |format=PDF |accessdate =|publisher = OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four tiers were:

# Those that have substantially implemented the standard (includes most countries but [[China]] still excludes [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]).
# Tax havens that have committed to – but not yet fully implemented – the standard (includes [[Montserrat]], [[Nauru]], [[Niue]], [[Panama]], and [[Vanuatu]])
# Financial centres that have committed to – but not yet fully implemented – the standard (includes [[Guatemala]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Uruguay]]).
# Those that have not committed to the standard (an empty category)

Those countries in the bottom tier were initially classified as being 'non-cooperative tax havens'. Uruguay was initially classified as being uncooperative. However, upon appeal the OECD stated that it did meet tax transparency rules and thus moved it up. The Philippines took steps to remove itself from the blacklist and [[Malaysian Prime Minister]] [[Najib Razak]] had suggested earlier that Malaysia should not be in the bottom tier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=OECD names and shames tax havens |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-04-03 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7980848.stm |accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009 the OECD announced through its chief Angel Gurria that Costa Rica, Malaysia, the Philippines and Uruguay have been removed from the blacklist after they had made "a full commitment to exchange information to the OECD standards."&lt;ref name="bbc2009-04-07"&gt;{{cite news |title=OECD removes tax havens from list |author=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7987417.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-04-07 |accessdate=2009-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite calls from the former [[French President]] [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] for [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] to be included on the list separately from China, they are as yet not included independently, although it is expected that they will be added at a later date.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

In December 2017, European Union adopted blacklist of tax havens in a bid to discourage the most aggressive tax dodging practices. It also had a so-called gray list which includes those who have committed to change their rules on tax transparency and cooperation. The 17 blacklisted territories are: [[American Samoa]], [[Bahrain]], [[Barbados]], [[Grenada]], [[Guam]], [[South Korea]], [[Macau]], [[The Marshall Islands]], [[Mongolia]], [[Namibia]], [[Palau]], [[Panama]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Samoa]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Tunisia]], [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-tax-blacklist/eu-tax-haven-blacklist-set-to-shrink-further-causing-outcry-idUSKCN1GI1F4|title=EU tax haven blacklist set to shrink further, causing outcry|first=Francesco|last=Guarascio|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some activists denounced the listing process as a whitewash and had called for the inclusion in the blacklist of some EU countries accused of facilitating tax avoidance, like [[Luxembourg]], [[Malta]], [[Ireland]] and the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42237315|title=First tax havens blacklist published by EU|first=Jamie|last=Robertson|date=5 December 2017|accessdate=17 April 2018|website=Bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The use of differing tax laws between two or more countries to try to mitigate tax liability is probably as old as taxation itself.&lt;ref name="ronen.palan"/&gt;In [[Ancient Greece]], some of the [[Greek Islands]] were used as depositories by the sea traders of the era to place their foreign goods to thus avoid the two-percent tax imposed by the [[city-state]] of [[Athens]] on imported goods. The practice may have first reached prominence through the avoidance of the [[Cinque Ports#Formation and privileges|Cinque Ports]] and later the [[staple port]]s in the twelfth and fourteenth centuries respectively. In 1721, [[United States|American]] colonies traded from [[Latin America]] to avoid [[British Empire|British]] taxes.{{citation needed||date=April 2016}}

Various countries claim to be the oldest tax haven in the world. For example, the [[Channel Islands]] claim their tax independence dating as far back as [[Norman Conquest]], while the [[Isle of Man]] claims to trace its fiscal independence to even earlier times. Nonetheless, the modern concept of a tax haven is generally accepted to have emerged at an uncertain point in the immediate aftermath of [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;"[T]he tax haven is a creature of the twentieth century, and began to be used extensively because of the high levels of tax which prevailed after the First World War" at para 26.1, ''Tolley's International Tax Planning'' (2002), {{ISBN|0-7545-1339-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bermuda]] sometimes optimistically claims to have been the first tax haven based upon the creation of the first [[offshore company|offshore companies]] legislation in 1935 by the newly created law firm of [[Conyers Dill &amp; Pearman]].&lt;ref&gt;See generally Introduction to ''Tolley's International Initiatives Affecting Financial Havens'' (2001), {{ISBN|0-406-94264-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Bermudian claim is debatable when compared against the enactment of a [[Trust law|Trust Law]] by [[Liechtenstein]] in 1926 to attract offshore capital.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Personen- und Gesellschaftsrecht'' of 20 January 1926&lt;/ref&gt;{{nonspecific|date=April 2016}}

Most economic commentators suggest that the first "true" tax haven was [[Switzerland]], followed closely by Liechtenstein.&lt;ref name=Tolley/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}} [[Banking in Switzerland|Swiss banks]] had long been a ''capital haven'' for people fleeing social upheaval in Russia, Germany, South America and elsewhere. However, in the early part of the twentieth century, during the years immediately following [[World War I]], many European governments raised taxes sharply to help pay for reconstruction efforts following the devastation of World War I. By and large, Switzerland, having remained neutral during the Great War, avoided these additional infrastructure costs and was consequently able to maintain a low level of taxes. As a result, there was a considerable influx of capital into the country for tax related reasons. It is difficult, nonetheless, to pinpoint a single event or precise date which clearly identifies the emergence of the modern tax haven.{{citation needed||date=April 2016}}

The use of modern tax havens has gone through several phases of development subsequent to the [[interwar period]].  From the 1920s to the 1950s, tax havens were usually referenced as the avoidance of personal taxation.  The terminology was often used with reference to countries to which a person could retire and mitigate their post retirement tax position, a usage which was still being echoed to some degree in a 1990 report, which included indications of [[quality of life]] in various tax havens which future [[tax exile]]s may wish to consider.&lt;ref&gt;''Tax Havens and Their Uses'', [[The Economist]],1990, Special Report No. 1191, {{ISBN|0 85058 292 X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s onward, there was significant growth in the use of tax havens by corporate groups to mitigate their global [[Tax incidence|tax burden]]. The strategy generally relied upon there being a [[double taxation]] [[tax treaty|treaty]] between a large country with a high tax burden (that the company would otherwise be subject to), and a smaller country with a low tax burden. By structuring the group ownership through the smaller country, corporations could take advantage of the double taxation treaty, paying taxes at the much lower rate. Although some of these double tax treaties survive,{{when|date=April 2016}}, for example between [[Barbados]] and [[Japan]], between [[Cyprus]] and [[Russia]] and [[Mauritius]] with [[India]], which India sought to renegotiate in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;Sidhartha [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/NEWS/India_Business/India_to_push_for_change_in_tax_treaty_with_Mauritius/articleshow/1068539.cms India to push for change in tax treaty with Mauritius], Times of India, 6 January 2007,&lt;/ref&gt; most major countries began repealing their double taxation treaties with [[Microstate|micro-states]] in the 1970s, to prevent [[corporate tax]] leakage in this manner.{{citation needed||date=April 2016}}

In the early to mid-1980s, most tax havens changed the focus of their legislation to create corporate vehicles which were "[[ring fence|ring-fenced]]" and exempt from local taxation (although they usually could not trade locally either). These vehicles were usually called "exempt companies" or "[[international business corporation]]s". However, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the [[OECD]] began a series of initiatives aimed at tax havens to curb the abuse of what the OECD referred to as "[[unfair tax competition]]". Under pressure from the OECD, most major tax havens repealed their laws permitting these ring-fenced vehicles to be incorporated, but concurrently they amended their tax laws so that a company which did not actually trade within the country would not accrue any local tax liability.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the [[British Virgin Islands]] repealed the [[International Business Companies Act]] (Cap 291) (which had prohibited such companies from trading locally) and enacted the [[BVI Business Companies Act]] 2004 (which permitted this) in its place.  Contemporaneously it varied its [[Taxation in the British Virgin Islands|tax laws]] by amending the Income Tax Act (Cap 206), which amended the rate of income tax for individuals and corporations to zero, along with the Payroll Taxes Act 2004 which imposed a (new) payroll tax on person employed by businesses within the British Virgin Islands.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7464">'''The Helsinki Rules on the Uses of the Waters of International Rivers''' is an international guideline regulating how rivers and their connected [[groundwater]]s that cross national boundaries may be used, adopted by the [[International Law Association]] (ILA) in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] in August 1966. In spite of its adoption by the ILA, there is no mechanism in place that enforces the rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Browne | first = Anthony | date = 2003-08-19 | title = Water wars, water wars, everywhere... | publisher = The Times | url = http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article877529.ece | accessdate = 2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding the guideline's lack of formal status, its work on rules governing international rivers was pioneering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Raj | first1 = Krishna |last2 = Salman | first2 = Salman M.A. | chapter = International Groundwater Law and the World Bank Policy for Projects on Transboundary Groundwater | editor1-last = Salman | editor1-first = Salman M. A. | title = Groundwater: Legal and Policy Perspectives : Proceedings of a World Bank Seminar  | publisher= World Bank Publications | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-8213-4613-X | pages = 171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; It led to the creation of the [[United Nations]]' [[Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses]]. In 2004, it was superseded by the [[Berlin Rules on Water Resources]].

==Provisions==
Applicable to all [[drainage basin]]s that cross national boundaries, except where other agreement between bordering nations exists, the Helsinki Rules assert the rights of all bordering nations to an equitable share in the [[water resources]], with reasonable consideration of such factors as past customary usages of the resource and balancing variant needs and demands of the bordering nations. It also mandates protection of the resource by bordering nations with respect to [[water pollution]] in Chapter 3 (Articles IX to XI) and sets forth recommendations for resolving disputes over usage of such watercourses.

The Helsinki rules consist of 37 articles spread over 6 chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://webworld.unesco.org/water/wwap/pccp/cd/pdf/educational_tools/course_modules/reference_documents/internationalregionconventions/helsinkirules.pdf |title= The Helsinki Rules on the Uses of the Waters  of International Rivers |accessdate= 5 December 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070625012949/http://webworld.unesco.org/water/wwap/pccp/cd/pdf/educational_tools/course_modules/reference_documents/internationalregionconventions/helsinkirules.pdf |archivedate= 25 June 2007 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 2, Article 4 states: "Each basin State is entitled, within its territory, to a reasonable and equitable share in the beneficial uses of the waters of an international drainage basin".

In determining what is reasonable and equitable share, all relevant factors are to be considered together and a conclusion reached on the basis of the whole. The list provided in Article 5 (2) is produced in full below:

1.     The geography of the basin, including in particular the extent of the drainage area in the territory of each basin State

2.     The hydrology of the basin, including in particular the contribution of water by each basin State

3.     The climate affecting the basin

4.     The past utilization of the waters of the basin, including in particular existing utilization

5.     The economic and social needs of each basin State

6.     The population dependent on the waters of the basin in each basin State

7.     The comparative costs of alternative means of satisfying the economic and social needs of each basin State

8.     The availability of other resources

9.     The avoidance of unnecessary waste in the utilization of waters of the basin

10.  The practicability of compensation to one or more of the co-basin States as a means of adjusting conflicts among uses

11.  The degree to which the needs of a basin State may be satisfied, without causing substantial injury to a co-basin State

Article 6 precludes inherent preference of any use over others. Article 7 prohibits denial of reasonable use to a basin state on the basis of future uses of other states.

Article 8 relates to "existing reasonable uses".

Section 8 (1) states: "An existing reasonable use may continue in operation unless the factors justifying its continuance are outweighed by other factors leading to the conclusion that it be modified or terminated so as to accommodate a competing incompatible use".

Section 8 (2) defines the entry &amp; exit criterion of an existing use.

Section 8 (3) prohibits a use that is incompatible with an already existing reasonable use at the time of becoming operational from being treated as an existing use.

==Limitations==
Although "an important set of draft rules," according to Stephen McCaffrey of the [[McGeorge School of Law]], the Helsinki Rules do not address independent [[aquifer]]s, but only those connected to a river.&lt;ref name=McCaffrey&gt;{{cite book | last = McCaffrey | first = Stephen M. | chapter = International Groundwater Law: Evolution and Context | editor1-last = Salman | editor1-first = Salman M. A. | title = Groundwater: Legal and Policy Perspectives : Proceedings of a World Bank Seminar  | publisher= World Bank Publications | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-8213-4613-X | page = 152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the United Nations decided in 1970 to create a more inclusive set of guidelines, which after more than twenty years of investigation by the [[International Law Commission]] resulted in the adopting of the [[Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=Dellapenna&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ualg.pt/5cigpa/comunicacoes/Berlin%20Rules%20Summary.doc |first=Joseph W. |last=Dellapenna |title=The Berlin rules on water resources: the new paradigm for international water law |publisher=[[Universidade do Algarve]] |accessdate=2009-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20080301203852/http://www.ualg.pt/5cigpa/comunicacoes/Berlin%20Rules%20Summary.doc |archivedate=March 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ILA itself addressed this limitation in adopting the [[Rules on International Groundwaters]], also known as the Seoul Rules, in [[Seoul, Korea]] in 1986 and the Berlin Rules on Water Resources in 2004, which superseded this guideline.&lt;ref name=McCaffrey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dellapenna/&gt;

==Views==
After a natural or human-caused disaster, people may be urged to "go beyond thoughts and prayers," by donating blood or sending aid or money to help the victims. After the Las Vegas shooting, authorities said that although thoughts and prayers are appreciated, the most effective way to help was to give blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://qz.com/1092031/las-vegas-shooting-people-are-lining-up-at-blood-banks-to-help-the-victims/|title=Beyond thoughts and prayers: People line up at blood banks to help the victims of the Las Vegas shooting|last=Rigby|first=Sam|date=2 October 2017|work=Quartz|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
As "thoughts and prayers" became associated with post-tragedy condolences, commentators have criticized the phrase as a form of civilian or political [[slacktivism]].&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news |last=Willingham |first=AJ |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/20/us/thoughts-and-prayers-florida-school-shooting-trnd/index.html |title=How 'thoughts and prayers' went from common condolence to cynical meme |publisher=CNN |date=20 February 2018 |accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2007 [[Virginia Tech shooting]], [[Katrina vanden Heuvel]], editor of ''[[The Nation]]'', called on politicians to "move beyond thoughts and prayers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/blogs/edcut?pid=186561 |title=Beyond Thoughts and Prayers |author=vanden Heuvel, Katrina |date=16 April 2007 |work=The Nation |accessdate=3 October 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428201334/http://www.thenation.com/blogs/edcut?pid=186561 |archivedate=28 April 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her post, vanden Heuvel referred to a press release by [[Paul Helmke]], then-president of the [[Brady Campaign]], who offered his thoughts and prayers but also stated "it is long overdue for us to take some common-sense actions to prevent tragedies like this from continuing to occur."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://bradycampaign.org:80/media/release.php?release=884 |title=Nation Again Grieves Over A Tragedy "Of Monumental Proportions |author=Helmke, Paul |date=16 April 2007 |publisher=Brady Campaign |accessdate=3 October 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502133307/http://bradycampaign.org/media/release.php?release=884 |archivedate=2 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, following the [[Umpqua Community College shooting]], President [[Barack Obama]] said that "thoughts and prayers [do] not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel, and it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted some place else in America next week or a couple months from now."{{efn|name=Obamastatement}} The [[White House]] subsequently announced that Obama would continue to take more executive action on the subject of [[gun control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/10/05/daily-press-briefing-press-secretary-josh-earnest-1052015|title=Daily Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest, 10/5/2015|work=The White House|date=October 5, 2015|accessdate=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 2015, in the wake of the [[2015 San Bernardino attack|San Bernardino mass shooting]], Senator [[Chris Murphy (Connecticut politician)|Chris Murphy]] (D-CT) tweeted his frustration with the phrase "thoughts and prayers", a sentiment echoed by the cover of the ''New York Daily News'', which included tweets from senators and representatives the newspaper characterized as "meaningless platitudes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/02/politics/san-bernardino-chris-murphy-connecticut-tweet/index.html |title=Connecticut senator has had enough of 'thoughts' and 'prayers' |author=Diamond, Jeremy |date=3 December 2015 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Orlando nightclub shooting]], [[Phil Plait]] wrote that while it was "natural and very human" to "send their thoughts and express their grief ... it's cynically hypocritical when politicians do it ''and nothing else''", later noting it was "particularly galling" to see "all the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]]-funded lawmakers tweeting their 'thoughts and prayers'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2016/06/13/orlando_shooting_we_need_to_do_more_than_send_thoughts_and_prayers.html |title=Orlando: What can you do in the Face of Another Senseless Gun Tragedy |author=Plait, Phil |date=13 June 2016 |work=Slate |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An accompanying ''Slate'' post provided a selected list of members of Congress who had tweeted "thoughts and prayers" along with the amount of campaign contributions they had received from gun rights groups, based on research provided by Igor Volsky of the [[Center for American Progress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/06/12/gop_congressmen_offering_thoughts_and_prayers_for_orlando_accepted_nra_donations.html |title=GOP Congressmen Offer "Thoughts and Prayers."

Some critics of the phrase "thoughts and prayers" point to the [[Epistle of James]] in the Christian [[New Testament]] to argue that action is needed in addition to expressions of faith. Verses commonly cited to back up this argument include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/10/03/why-thoughts-and-prayers-is-starting-to-sound-so-profane/ |title=Acts of Faith: Why ‘thoughts and prayers’ is starting to sound so profane |author=Powers, Kirsten |date=3 October 2017 |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nola.com/opinions/index.ssf/2017/10/las_vegas_mass_shooting.html |title=Opinion: Your thoughts and prayers haven't stopped mass shootings |author=DeBerry, Jarvis |date=2 October 2017 |newspaper=The Times-Picayune |location=New Orleans, Louisiana |accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |text=What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, be warmed and filled," without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that?&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|James|2:14–2:16|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Defense===
Laura Coward, a writer for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', defended the use of the phrase "thoughts and prayers", acknowledging the inadequacy of not taking actions, but arguing that prayer "jolts us and disrupts us, removing us from our comfort zones [... it] takes us to uncomfortable places – spiritually, physically and emotionally – and asks us to do the hard work of accepting more than one perspective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/in-defense-of-offering-our-thoughts-and-prayers_us_57817fb5e4b0f06648f505d9 |title=In Defense of Offering Our 'Thoughts and Prayers' |author=Coward, Laura |date=9 July 2016 |website=Huffpost |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimberly Ross, a writer for ''[[RedState]]'', asks that victims should "not [be] used as pawns in another political debate about guns" since "[w]e shouldn't blame anyone but the perpetrator for crimes committed, [...] that means we can do nothing on our own – in that moment – apart from submitting thoughts and prayers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.redstate.com/kimberly_ross/2016/06/13/thoughts-prayers-always-needed-terror-strikes/ |title="Thoughts And Prayers" Are Always Needed After Terror Strikes |author=Ross, Kimberly |date=13 June 2016 |newspaper=RedState |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media==
In his third stand up special "Thoughts and Prayers", comedian [[Anthony Jeselnik]] skewers people who tweet out "thoughts and prayers" on the day of a tragedy, calling it a way for those people to garner attention in the face of a tragedy and saying that tweeting thoughts and prayers is so useless that it achieves "less than nothing".&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

In 2016, a web-based video game, ''Thoughts and Prayers: The Game'', was published to argue that thoughts and prayers have had no effect on saving lives in the context of mass shootings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/06/computer-game-shows-just-how-effective-your-thoughts-and-prayers-are.html |title=This Is Not Your Average Shooting Game |author=Kircher, Madison Malone |date=17 June 2016 |work=New York |accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth episode of the fourth season of animated series ''[[BoJack Horseman]]'', titled "Thoughts and Prayers", presents a real-life shooting that delays the opening of a new movie featuring gun violence.&lt;ref name=Browbeat-171002 /&gt;

In June 2017, the air date for an episode of ''[[The Carmichael Show]]'' entitled "Shoot-up-able", which showed the main character surviving a mass shooting, was postponed by two weeks so that it did not air 14 June, the same night as the shooting at which Representative Scalise and three others were shot, or the [[San Francisco UPS shooting|UPS shooting in San Francisco]], where three were killed by a shooter who later committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/06/15/nbc_postponed_a_carmichael_show_episode_about_mass_shootings.html |title=NBC Decides It's Too Soon for a ''Carmichael Show'' Episode About Mass Shootings |author=Adams, Sam |date=15 June 2017 |work=Slate |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/nbc-reschedules-carmichael-show-mass-shooting-episode-1016464 |title=NBC Reschedules 'Carmichael Show' Mass Shooting Episode |author=Stanhope, Kate |date=26 June 2017 |newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early August 2018, after court documents were made public showing the [[National Rifle Association#Finances|NRA was having financial issues]], mocking tweets were made offering thoughts and prayers for the NRA's troubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pitofsky |first1=Marina |title=Twitter users troll NRA for financial woes, calling for 'thoughts and prayers.' |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/08/04/nra-thoughts-and-prayers-twitter/905413002/ |accessdate=21 November 2018 |work=USA Today |date=4 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}
During May 31–June 2, 1953 workers in the city of [[Plzeň]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] revolted in violent protest against currency reform and the politics of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]]. The estimated number of casualties is around 220 injured, no-one was killed.

== Background ==
After the communist party took over power in 1948 it started to concentrate production on heavy industry, especially in armament production. The agricultural sector was forcibly [[Collectivisation#Czechoslovakia .281948-89.29|collectivised]]. But these policies led to shortages of customer goods, especially food, accompanied by inflation (28%&lt;!-- according to Pfaff --&gt;). The government's reaction was to increase the prices of state-supplied goods at the start of 1953. This led to growing disaffection among people, and to short-lived strikes.

The next step to be implemented was a currency reform, which amounted to a devaluation of savings.  All savings were devalued in the ratio of 50:1, all salaries in the ratio of 5:1 (small groups of people were exempted).  All obligations of the state were abolished. Rationing of food at subsidized prices was stopped and work quotas increased. The reform was announced on May 31, 1953, at 22:00, after months of rumors and denials by state representatives.

=== Background in Plzeň ===
Plzeň is a city in western Bohemia with large concentration of heavy industry, the largest factory being the famous [[Škoda Works]]. In the previous years and decades, the city saw many [[strike action|strikes]] of workers demanding the improvement of their lives. Many of the strikes were led by Communist party itself.

As long as the Party's reforms after 1948 favoured the workers in heavy industry, there was no reason to expect troubles. But in 1953 the factory management of Škoda Works deliberately paid off the wages for May one week earlier - thus reducing their values by 80% after the currency reform was announced.

== Uprising in Plzeň ==
News of the reform spread quickly among night shift workers in a plant of the Škoda Works in Plzeň, who then went on strike. The next day, in the morning, they decided to march to the city centre. Around noon the people attacked the city hall, and started to build barricades in the streets, and destroyed symbols of the communist party. Posters and slogans asking for the end of single party rule appeared.  Some of the local communists and uniformed policemen had joined or were forced to join the rebellion,{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} and 2,000 students had joined too{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}. Nearby [[Bory Prison]] was attacked with intention of releasing the prisoners, but the attack failed.

No central leadership of the uprising was established; its actions were chaotic and uncoordinated.

The government sent two police battalions (8,000 men) and an army unit (2,500 men, 80 tanks) to suppress the rebellion. During street fights about 220 rebels were injured. During the afternoon, June 2, the last insurgents barricaded themselves in factories and gave up. Over 2,000 people were taken prisoner immediately and martial law was imposed. The leaders of the uprising were promptly tried and sentenced to lengthy prison terms, one of whom was later executed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Communists and militiamen who had participated in the revolt were treated especially harshly.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

== Other cities ==
Strikes had started in 19 large industrial plants in Bohemia and Moravia, in industrial cities such as [[Kladno]] and [[Ostrava]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} These strikes didn't turn violent and ended within a week. An estimated 360,000 workers had gone on strike; up to 250,000 of them had demonstrated in the streets.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Aftermath==
The leaders of the Communist party decided to present the event as having been provoked by agents of imperialism and this remained the official explanation until 1989. The party was ordered to purge members suspected of "social-democratism" or of low levels of loyalty. The army stated that any future uprising would be suppressed immediately.

On June 8 the measures instituted on May 31 were recalled, except for the currency reform; also prices were reduced somewhat.

This and other uprisings in [[Central Europe]] forced the leaders of the [[Soviet Union]] to exercise greater control over these countries. {{fact|date=April 2017}}

No further violent uprising occurred in Czechoslovakia until the Warsaw Pact invasion of 1968. The [[Velvet Revolution]] (1989) that ended the power of the communist party was mostly bloodless. Detailed knowledge of the 1953 events in Plzeň was and still is relatively low among the Czech public. The shaken trust in the stability of the currency lasted for decades.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7088">'''''Victory for the Slain''''' is an [[anti-war]] [[poem]] written by children’s author [[Hugh Lofting]], creator of the ''[[Dr. Dolittle]]'' series.  Published in 1942, the poem is based on Lofting’s experiences during [[World War I]] and one of the strongest literary expressions of his [[pacifism]].  It was Lofting’s second book of verse but the only work written by him for adults.

[[File:Q 005717HoreseInGasMaskPilckemRidge31October1917.jpg|thumb|right|Hugh Lofting's pacifism, a major theme in the poem ''Victory for the Slain'', grew from his experiences in World War I where horses, like the one pictured here, had no way to defend themselves.]]

==Background and Lofting’s pacifism==
Lofting was a pacifist and was often frustrated at the quickness in which governments resorted to armed conflict to resolve international issues.  Lofting would often mock the reoccurring “latest war to end all wars” mentality and the martial ardor that often pervaded children’s literature. While the theme of the poem is no different from those in the ''Dr. Dolittle'' series, the “meaningless and folly of war” as one commentator put it, it is presented in a manner more dark and grim than his children’s literature.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Schmidt, G.D. (1992). Hugh Lofting.  New York: Twayne Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

That Lofting was consistent in his views is not surprising, having witnessed the horrors of war in [[Flanders]] during the First World War.  In 1918 he was wounded by [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] from a hand [[grenade]] in the upper thigh, an injury that would plague him the rest of his life because of the doctor’s inability to remove the metal fragments.  Soon after his injury he left active service and moved to the [[United States]] where he wrote his popular children’s series about a country [[physician]] who learned to communicate with animals.   Lofting wrote his ''Dr. Dolittle'' series in order to give the animals he saw in World War I a voice they didn't have.  In a larger sense, however, it was clear from the start that the ''Dr. Dolittle'' series was about the cruelty of war itself and the hope that Lofting saw from peace and cooperation.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Steege, D. (2003). Doctor Dolittle and the empire: Hugh Lofting's response to British colonialism. In A.L. Lucas (Ed.)Presence of The Past In Children’s Literature, 91-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1924, Lofting was editorializing about the negative effects of war on children.  In an article written for ''[[The Nation]]'', Lofting railed against what he called “tin-soldierism,” a state of mind common at the time that glorified war and “heroic deaths”.  He attacked the so-called children’s classics about heroes galloping across battlefields.  “That kind of battlefield has gone for good,” he wrote, “it is still bloody, but you don’t gallop.  And since that kind of battlefield has gone, that kind of book—for children—should go too.”&lt;ref&gt;Lofting, H. (1924). Children and internationalism. Nation, 118:172-173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lofting would become an internationalist as a result of his experiences stemming from World War I and advocated “Peace Preparedness” between nations.  He would also, at least implicitly, become an anti-imperialist who stressed international cooperation.  This spirit of cooperation is evident in his children’s books.  For instance, in ''The Voyages of Dr. Dolittle'', the title character defends a smaller tribe of “Indians” from a larger tribe.  Eventually Dolittle helps the two tribes forge a pact of cooperation.  This is just one of many examples of his pacifist philosophy in his children’s literature.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Lofting’s call for peace and preparedness fell on deaf ears and the economic instability that followed World War I, resulting in the Great Depression, would manifest itself pre-World War II [[Germany during World War II|Germany’s]] political situation.  Lofting fell into a state of despair at the rise of [[militarism]] on the European continent.  Feeling like a modern Cassandra, Lofting began work on his seventeenth book, ''Dr. Dolittle and the Secret Lake''.  In the summer of 1941, however, he stopped work on the book to write ''Victory for the Slain''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Written just after the major part of Germany’s bombing [[The Blitz|blitz]] on London, the poem’s eventual publication in 1942 was met with little regard.  Coming on the heels of England’s near eradication, and written from the safe confines of California as his critics would say, it was not well received.  That the poem was a culmination of a long-standing philosophy held by the author, rather than a reaction to the current conflict, was not understood by its readers.  A commercial failure, the importance of ''Victory for the Slain'' lies in the understanding it adds to the author of the ''Dr. Dolittle'' series and the peaceful title character more than the content of the poem itself.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Structure==
''Victory for the Slain'' is divided into seven parts, with each part symbolic of the narrator’s progression.  It uses a traditional [[Rhyming pattern|rhyming convention]].  The word “slain” is repeated in the poem thirteen times and the thematic line, “In war the only victors are the slain,” is repeated three times.  It uses a mix of military and religious symbolism throughout the seven movements.

==Plot and themes==
The narrator is an unknown individual who journeys to and eventually into, a [[cathedral]].  On the way, in the first two movements of the poem, he passes infantry soldiers marching and a wounded World War I veteran. The narrator also passes the poor box which is symbolic of the wealth and treasures wasted in war.  In the third movement the narrator then enters a church to seek solace where he muses about the folly of war and the inability of man to learn from his past mistakes as shown in this verse:

:  Why must I mingle and confuse
:  These sounds and thoughts that muse
:  So madly through my mind?
:  Wars to end wars? —War again!
:  Must Mankind forever kill and kill,
:  Thwarting every decent dictate
:  Of the human will?
:  War again! —
:  When well we know
:    War's final victors always were the slain.

In the end, the narrator doesn't find the solace that he seeks as the [[chancel]], the portion of the cathedral he is in during three sections of the poem, is destroyed by bombs.  However, the narrator vows to learn from the lessons of the past and not give in to hatred and military revenge.  It is here, perhaps, that Lofting is referencing the ongoing conflict of World War II against the [[Nazi]] regime.  Thus, Lofting and the narrator, as a single person, hope that the “slain” can lead the world to an enlightened peace.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
