      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1075">'''API TC''' is a [[product certification|certification]] for [[Two-stroke cycle|two-stroke]] [[Motor oil|oils]], awarded by the [[American Petroleum Institute]]. It is given after the product passes through stringent tests that determine the level of [[detergent]] performance, [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]], and [[Antioxidant|anti-oxidation]]. It is the only remaining, not revoked classification of the API Two-Cycle motor oil specifications (TA, TB, TC, TD). Being a very old standard itself, most currently produced 2T lubricants meet its specifications, even the lowest quality ones; current high-quality oils exceed them (often labeled "API TC+" although not based on actual measurements).

The more current [[JASO_M345]] or the international [[ISO]] two-cycle oil specifications are much better indicators of oil quality, with requirements based on modern two-stroke engines and environmental policies.

'''Aquion Energy''' is a [[Pittsburgh]]-based company that manufactured [[Sodium-ion battery|sodium ion batteries]] ([[salt water battery|salt water batteries]]) and [[electricity storage]] systems.

The company claims to provide a low-cost way to store large amounts of energy (e.g. for an electricity grid) through thousands of battery cycles, and a non-toxic end product made from widely available material inputs and which operates safely and reliably across a wide range of temperatures and operating environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technology |url=http://www.aquionenergy.com/energy-storage-technology   |publisher=Aquion |date= |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The company was founded in 2008 by Jay F. Whitacre, a professor at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], and Ted Wiley. They set up research and development offices in [[Lawrenceville (Pittsburgh)|Lawrenceville]], where it produced pilot-stage batteries.
Whitacre received a BA in physics from [[Oberlin College]] and a PhD in materials science from the [[University of Michigan]]. He held  positions at [[California Institute of Technology]] and the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], studying energy-related topics ranging from fundamental materials function to systems engineering. In 2007 he accepted a professorship at Carnegie Mellon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebatteryshow.com/data/2013/speakers-2013/jay-whitacre |title=Dr Jay Whitacre |publisher=The Battery Show |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=YSb4dXEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en |title=Jay Whitacre - Google Scholar Citations |publisher=Scholar.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company raised funding from [[Kleiner Perkins]], [[Foundation Capital]], [[Bill Gates]], Nick and Jobey Pritzker, Bright Capital and [[Advanced Technology Ventures]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/aquion-energy-announces-35-million-financing-round-to-support-commercialization-and-launch-of-novel-energy-storage-systems-2013-04-02 |title=Aquion Energy Announces $35 Million Financing Round to Support Commercialization and Launch of Novel Energy Storage Systems |publisher=MarketWatch |date= |accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, an individual battery stack was promoted to store 1.5 kWh, a shipping container-sized unit 180 kWh.&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite web |author=Martin LaMonica |url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-20081944-54/aquion-energy-takes-plunge-into-bulk-grid-storage/ |title=Aquion Energy takes plunge into bulk grid storage |publisher= Cnet News |date= July 22, 2011 |accessdate= January 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014 they announced a new generation with a single stack reaching 2.4 [[Kilowatt hour|kWh]] and a multi-stack module holding 25.5 [[Kilowatt hour|kWh.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2014/11/13/aquion-energy-reveals-second-gen-ahi-battery-technology-40-increase-energy/|title=Aquion Energy Reveals Second-Gen AHI Battery Technology, 40% Increase In Energy|work=CleanTechnica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://gigaom.com/2014/10/21/startup-aquion-energy-shows-off-the-next-generation-of-its-battery-for-solar-the-grid/ |title= Startup Aquion Energy shows off the next generation of its battery for solar and the grid |author= Katie Fehrenbacher |work=GigaOm |date= October 21, 2014 |accessdate= January 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the company announced  it would supply batteries for a Hawaii [[microgrid]] to serve as backup for a 176-kilowatt solar panel array that would store 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.technologyreview.com/news/534096/grid-batteries-for-wind-solar-find-first-customers|title = Grid Batteries for Wind, Solar Find First Customers |author = Kevin Bullis |date = January 8, 2015 |work= MIT Technology Review |access-date = January 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, Whitacre won the [[Lemelson–MIT Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smit|first1=Deb|title=CMU’s Jay Whitacre wins the Lemelson-MIT Prize for his incredible, edible (nontoxic) battery|url=http://www.nextpittsburgh.com/business-tech-news/cmus-jay-whitacre-wins-lemelson-mit-prize-incredible-edible-nontoxic-battery/|website=next pittsburgh|accessdate=16 September 2015|ref=Lemelson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, Aquion Energy filed for [[Bankruptcy|voluntary bankruptcy]] under [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://powersource.post-gazette.com/powersource/companies/2017/03/08/Energy-storage-company-Aquion-Energy-files-for-Chapter-11-bankruptcy-Pittsburgh-sodium-ion/stories/201703080186|title=Hyped battery maker Aquion Energy files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy|work=PowerSource: Energy News.

In August 2017, [[MIT Technology Review]] claimed the China Titans acquisition would mean that Aquion "''will continue operating as an independent entity, with research and development probably remaining in Pittsburgh. But manufacturing may move elsewhere, potentially somewhere in China''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Temple|first1=James|title=Inside the Fall, and Rebirth, of a Bill Gates–Backed Battery Startup|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608553/inside-the-fall-and-rebirth-of-a-bill-gates-backed-battery-startup/|website=[[MIT Technology Review]]|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017 Juline-Titans closed the East Huntingdon Township facility and moved production to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/business/battery-company-closes-plant-moves-operation-to-china/|title=Battery company closes plant, moves operation to China|date=2017-09-19|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1378">'''Basic sediment and water''' (BS&amp;W) is a technical specification of certain impurities in [[crude oil]].  When extracted from an [[oil reservoir]], the crude oil will contain some amount of water and [[suspended solids]] from the reservoir formation.  The particulate matter is known as sediment or mud.  The water content can vary greatly from field to field, and may be present in large quantities for older fields, or if oil extraction is enhanced using [[Water injection (oil production)|water injection]] technology.  The bulk of the water and sediment is usually separated at the field to minimize the quantity that needs to be transported further.  The residual content of these unwanted impurities is measured as BS&amp;W.  [[Oil refinery|Oil refineries]] may either buy crude to a certain BS&amp;W specification or may alternatively have initial crude oil dehydration and [[desalter|desalting]] process units that reduce the BS&amp;W to acceptable limits, or a combination thereof.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3577">A '''bosenova''' or '''bose supernova''' is a very small, [[supernova]]-like explosion, which can be induced in a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] (BEC) by changing the external [[magnetic field]], so that the [[Scattering length|"self-scattering" interaction]] transitions from repulsive to [[Bose–Einstein condensate#Attractive interactions|attractive]] due to the [[Feshbach resonance]], causing the BEC to "collapse and bounce" or "rebound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title=Implosion and explosion of a Bose-Einstein condensate "Bosenova"
 | author=Staff | publisher=NIST | website=News from NIST
 | url=https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/bosenova.cfm
 | accessdate=2010-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the total energy of the explosion is very small, the "collapse and bounce" scenario qualitatively resembles a condensed matter version of a [[Supernova#Core collapse|core-collapse supernova]], hence the term ''bosenova''. The nomenclature is a play of words on the Brazilian music style, [[bossa nova]].

== Experiment ==
In the particular experiment when a bosenova was first detected, transitioning the [[self-energy|self-interaction]] from repulsive to attractive caused the BEC to implode and shrink to a size smaller than the optical detector's minimum [[Angular resolution|resolution limit]], and then suddenly "explode." In this explosion, about half of the atoms in the condensate superficially seemed to have "disappeared" from the experiment altogether, i.e., they were not detected in either the cold particle remnants nor in the expanding gas cloud produced.

{{quote|The 'missing' atoms are almost certainly still around in some form, but just not in a form that we can detect them in our current experiment, the two likely possibilities are that they have formed into molecules of two rubidium atoms stuck together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Under current [[Bose–Einstein condensate#Models|BEC theory]], which only very crudely accounts for the interactions between the particles composing the BEC, the bosenova phenomenon remains unexplained, because the energy available to the individual atoms of the condensate near absolute zero appears to be insufficient to cause the observed implosion. However, subsequent [[mean-field theory|mean-field theories]] have been proposed to explain bosenovas as a [[Condensed matter physics#Emergence|collective phenomenon]].

The bosenova behaviour of a BEC may provide insights into the behavior of a [[neutron star]], as well as into the possible properties of still-hypothetical [[Exotic star#Boson stars|boson stars]] and into the quantum theory of "collective phenomena" in general.

      <comment>Statements were slightly unclear. Human activities result in GHGs which affect the climate by warming; our activities don't directly affect the climate. Reporting serves several purposes; but the overall goal is to reduce emissions from business activities. The "ways" remain efficiency improvements and renewable energy.</comment>

Human activities — including the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, agricultural practices (e.g., the use of fertilizer, and raising livestock), industrial processes, refrigeration, and the use of several consumer products — result in the emission of [[greenhouse gases]].&lt;ref&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2013 Summary for Policymakers. http://templatelab.com/climatechange-WGI-AR5-SPM-brochure/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data (EPA) http://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data&lt;/ref&gt; 

One method to encourage and possibly regulate companies to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from their activities, is through the voluntary or mandatory reporting of companies' greenhouse gas emissions.  Large power stations and manufacturing plants are often required to report their emissions to appropriate government entities, for example to the European Union as part of the Emissions Trading System &lt;ref&gt;EU Emissions Trading System. http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; or to the US EPA as part of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)]] has described [[climate change]] as the "greatest environmental challenge facing the world today,"[http://www.defra.gov.uk/publications/files/pb13310-ghg-small-business-guide.pdf] and it is now a legal requirement for all quoted companies to report their annual greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="mandatory-reporting-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbontrust.com/resources/guides/carbon-footprinting-and-reporting/mandatory-carbon-reporting|title=Mandatory carbon reporting|publisher=[[Carbon Trust]]|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandatory Greenhouse Gas reporting==

In the past there were several attempts to institute mandatory reporting legislation but none has been implemented in the US. In the wake of BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and increasing social awareness about the environment, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) started the environmental Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The EPA’s GHG reporting program became a law on January 1, 2010. It forces 85% of the nation’s top emitters to report on how much GHG they have emitted. According to this law companies are due to report their emission for the year of 2010 on March 21 of 2011.

In the first year of this legislation only 85% of the nations leading emitters are required to report their annual reports. Plans are to slightly increase this number each to start keep tabs on the amount they emit.

This program is the initial step into countering rising emissions rate. While many believe that if companies are forced to report their emissions, they will be more inclined to lower their impact, this effect has not been thoroughly studied.  The ability to attract more investment as consumers prefer environmentally friendly products may be another incentive, but again there is little evidence to support any strong claims.

In June 2012, the UK [[coalition government]] announced the introduction of mandatory carbon reporting, requiring all UK companies listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange - around 1,100 of the UK’s largest listed companies - to report their [[greenhouse gas emissions]] every year.&lt;ref&gt;Guide to UK Mandatory Carbon Reporting. http://ecometrica.com/products/our-impacts/mandatory-carbon-reporting/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Nick Clegg]] confirmed that emission reporting rules would come into effect from April 2013 in his piece for The Guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Juliette|first=Jowit|title=New emissions policy will force biggest UK firms to reveal CO2 figures|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/19/emissions-policy-firms-reveal-co2|accessdate=10 January 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this date has now been set to 1 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://ecometrica.com/products/our-impacts/mandatory-carbon-reporting/&lt;/ref&gt;

== [[ISO 14064]] ==
The ISO 14064 standards for greenhouse gas accounting and verification published on 1 March 2006 by [http://www.iso.org/iso/home.htm ISO (International Organization for Standardization)] provide government and industry with an integrated set of tools for programmes aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as well as for emissions trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Retrieved on 20 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Upstream activities ===
Cradle-to-gate (sometimes referred to as "upstream") emission factors, which include all emissions that occur in the life cycle of a material/product &lt;u&gt;up to&lt;/u&gt; the point of sale by the producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Cooperation: ISO, WRI, and WBSCD ==
ISO (International Organization for Standardization), the World Resources Institute  (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) have signed a Memorandum of  Understanding (MoU) under which they have agreed to jointly promote the ISO 14064 standards and the  WRI and WBCSD GHG Protocol standards. The move is in response to concerns among businesses and GHG program designers that  the two standards might not be consistent and mutually supportive. In fact, for corporate accounting,  requirements and guidance contained in ISO and GHG Protocol standards are consistent and they are designed  so that they can be used in a complementary manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Criticism ==
Whilst specific critiques of carbon reporting have emerged (see below) by and large, the actual practice of how organisations account for and report emissions remains understudied.&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann, L. (2009, Apr). Toward a different debate in environmental accounting: The cases of carbon and cost–benefit. Accounting, Organizations and Society 34, 499–534.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacKenzie, D.

Chinn, ''Ceramography'', ASM International and the American Ceramic Society, 2002, p 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Ceramography can be thought of as the [[metallography]] of ceramics. The microstructure is the structure level of approximately 0.1 to 100 [[Micrometre|µm]], between the minimum [[wavelength]] of [[Visible spectrum|visible light]] and the resolution limit of the naked eye. The microstructure includes most grains, secondary phases, [[Grain boundary|grain boundaries]], pores, micro-cracks and hardness microindentions. Most bulk mechanical, optical, thermal, [[Electroceramics|electrical]] and magnetic properties are significantly affected by the microstructure. The fabrication method and process conditions are generally indicated by the microstructure. The root cause of many ceramic failures is evident in the microstructure. Ceramography is part of the broader field of materialography, which includes all the microscopic techniques of material analysis, such as metallography, [[petrography]] and plastography.  Ceramography is usually reserved for high-performance ceramics for industrial applications, such as 85&amp;ndash;99.9% [[alumina]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in Fig. 1, [[zirconia]] (ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[silicon carbide]] (SiC), [[silicon nitride]] (Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and ceramic-matrix [[Composite material|composites]].  It is seldom used on whiteware [[Pottery|ceramics]] such as sanitaryware, wall tiles and dishware.

== History  ==
Ceramography evolved along with other branches of materialography and [[Ceramic engineering#History of Ceramics in Engineering|ceramic engineering]].  [[Count Alois von Beckh Widmanstätten|Alois de Widmanstätten]] of Austria etched a meteorite in 1808 to reveal pro[[Eutectic point|eutectoid]] [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] bands that grew on prior [[austenite]] grain boundaries.  Geologist [[Henry Clifton Sorby]], the "father of metallography," applied petrographic techniques to the steel industry in the 1860s in Sheffield, England.&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Smith, ''A History of Metallography'', University of Chicago Press, 1960, p 169&amp;ndash;185.&lt;/ref&gt;  French geologist [[Auguste Michel-Lévy]] devised a chart that correlated the optical properties of minerals to their transmitted color and thickness in the 1880s.  Swedish metallurgist J.A. [[Brinell scale|Brinell]] invented the first quantitative hardness scale in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;V.E. Lysaght, ''Indentation Hardness Testing'', Reinhold Publishing Corp., 1949, p 17&amp;ndash;18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith and Sandland developed the first microindention hardness test at [[Vickers]] Ltd. in London in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Smith and G.E. Sandland, “An Accurate Method of Determining the Hardness of Metals, with Particular Reference to Those of a High Degree of Hardness,” ''Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers'', Vol. I, 1922, p 623–641.&lt;/ref&gt;  Swiss-born microscopist A.I. Buehler started the first metallographic equipment manufacturer near Chicago in 1936.  Frederick Knoop and colleagues at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Bureau of Standards]] developed a less-penetrating (than Vickers) microindention test in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;F. Knoop, C.G. Peters and W.B. Emerson, “A Sensitive Pyramidal-Diamond Tool for Indentation Measurements,” ''Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards'', V23 #1, July 1939, Research Paper RP1220, p 39–61.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Holger F. Struer|Struers]] A/S of Copenhagen introduced the [[electrolytic]] polisher to metallography in 1943.  George Kehl of [[Columbia University]] wrote a book that was considered the bible of materialography until the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;G.L. Kehl, ''The Principles of Metallographic Laboratory Practice'', McGraw–Hill Book Co., 1939, 1943 &amp; 1949 (three editions).&lt;/ref&gt;  Kehl co-founded a group within the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] that became the [[ASM International (society)| International Metallographic Society]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalmetallographicsociety.org/ International Metallographic Society]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1967.

==Preparation of ceramographic specimens==
The preparation of ceramic specimens for microstructural analysis consists of five broad steps: [[saw]]ing, embedding, [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]], [[polishing]] and [[Industrial etching|etching]].  The tools and consumables for ceramographic preparation are available worldwide from metallography equipment vendors and [[laboratory]] supply companies.
===Sawing===
Most ceramics are extremely hard and must be wet-sawed with a circular blade embedded with diamond particles. A metallography or [[lapidary]] saw equipped with a low-density [[Diamond tool|diamond blade]] is usually suitable.  The blade must be cooled by a continuous liquid spray.

===Embedding===
To facilitate further preparation, the sawed specimen is usually embedded (or mounted or encapsulated) in a plastic disc, 25, 30 or 35&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter. A [[Thermosetting plastic|thermosetting]] solid [[resin]], activated by heat and [[Compression molding|compression]], e.g. mineral-filled [[epoxy]], is best for most applications. A castable (liquid) resin such as unfilled epoxy, [[Polymethyl methacrylate|acrylic]] or [[polyester]] may be used for porous [[refractory]] ceramics or [[Microelectronics|microelectronic]] devices.  The castable resins are also available with [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] dyes that aid in [[fluorescence microscopy]].  The left and right specimens in Fig. 3 were embedded in mineral-filled epoxy.  The center refractory in Fig. 3 was embedded in castable, transparent acrylic.

===Grinding===
Grinding is abrasion of the surface of interest by [[abrasive]] particles, usually diamond, that are bonded to paper or a metal disc. Grinding erases saw marks, coarsely smooths the surface, and removes stock to a desired depth.  A typical grinding sequence for ceramics is one minute on a 240-[[Particle size (grain size)|grit]] metal-bonded [[diamond]] wheel rotating at 240 rpm and lubricated by flowing water, followed by a similar treatment on a 400-grit wheel.  The specimen is washed in an ultrasonic bath after each step.

===Polishing===
Polishing is abrasion by free abrasives that are suspended in a lubricant and can roll or slide between the specimen and paper.  Polishing erases grinding marks and smooths the specimen to a mirror-like finish.  Polishing on a bare metallic platen is called [[lapping]].  A typical polishing sequence for ceramics is 5&amp;ndash;10 minutes each on 15-, 6- and 1-µm diamond paste or slurry on [[Nap (textile)|napless]] paper rotating at 240 rpm.  The specimen is again washed in an ultrasonic bath after each step.  The three sets of specimens in Fig. 3 have been sawed, embedded, ground and polished.

===Etching===
Etching reveals and delineates grain boundaries and other microstructural features that are not apparent on the as-polished surface. The two most common types of etching in ceramography are selective chemical corrosion, and a thermal treatment that causes [[relief]].  As an example, alumina can be chemically etched by immersion in boiling concentrated [[phosphoric acid]] for 30&amp;ndash;60 s, or thermally etched in a furnace for 20&amp;ndash;40 min at {{convert|1500|°C|°F}} in air.  The plastic encapsulation must be removed before thermal etching.  The alumina in Fig. 1 was thermally etched.

[[File:Ceramographic_sections.jpg|thumb|Embedded, polished ceramographic sections.]]

Alternatively, non-cubic ceramics can be prepared as [[thin section]]s, also known as '''petrography''', for examination by polarized transmitted light microscopy.  In this technique, the specimen is sawed to ~1&amp;nbsp;mm thick, glued to a [[microscope slide]], and ground or sawed (e.g., by [[microtome]]) to a thickness (''x'') approaching 30&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref&gt;U. Täffner &amp; R. Telle, "Experience Gained in Preparing Thin Sections of High-Performance Ceramics Using the Discoplan-
TS," ''Structure'', '''24''', Feb 1991, p 12–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Ahmed, "Petrographic Examination Methods," ''Tech-Notes'', Buehler Ltd., Vol 3, Issue 5, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  A cover slip is glued onto the exposed surface.  The adhesives, such as epoxy or [[Canada balsam]] resin, must have approximately the same [[refractive index]] (η ≈ 1.54) as glass.  Most ceramics have a very small [[absorption coefficient]] (α ≈ 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; for alumina in Fig. 2) in the [[Beer-Lambert law]] below, and can be viewed in transmitted light.  [[Cubic crystal system|Cubic]] ceramics, e.g. yttria-stabilized zirconia and [[spinel]], have the same refractive index in all [[Crystallography|crystallographic]] directions and appear, therefore, black when the microscope's [[polarizer]] is 90° out of phase with its [[Optical mineralogy|analyzer]].
: &lt;math&gt;I_t = I_0e^{-\alpha x}&lt;/math&gt; (Beer–Lambert eqn)

Ceramographic specimens are electrical insulators in most cases, and must be coated with a conductive ~10-nm layer of metal or carbon for electron microscopy, after polishing and etching.  Gold or Au-Pd alloy from a sputter coater or evaporative coater also improves the reflection of visible light from the polished surface under a microscope, by the [[Fresnel equations|Fresnel formula]] below.  Bare alumina (η ≈ 1.77, ''k'' ≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;6&lt;/sup&gt;) has a negligible [[refractive index#Dispersion and absorption|extinction coefficient]] and reflects only 8% of the incident light from the microscope, as in Fig. 1.  Gold-coated (''η'' ≈ 0.82, ''k'' ≈ 1.59 @ λ = 500&amp;nbsp;nm) alumina reflects 44% in air, 39% in [[immersion oil]].
: &lt;math&gt;R = \frac{I_r}{I_i} = \frac{(\eta_1 - \eta_2)^2 + k^2}{(\eta_1 + \eta_2)^2 + k^2}&lt;/math&gt; (Fresnel eqn)

==Ceramographic analysis==
Ceramic microstructures are most often analyzed by reflected visible-light [[Optical microscope|microscopy]] in [[Bright field microscopy|brightfield]].  [[Dark field microscopy|Darkfield]] is used in limited circumstances, e.g., to reveal cracks.  [[Polarization (waves)|Polarized]] transmitted light is used with thin sections, where the contrast between grains comes from [[birefringence]]. Very fine microstructures may require the higher [[magnification]] and [[Optical resolution|resolution]] of a [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM) or [[confocal laser scanning microscopy|confocal laser scanning microscope]] (CLSM).  The [[cathodoluminescence microscope]] (CLM) is useful for distinguishing phases of refractories.  The [[Transmission electron microscopy|transmission electron microscope]] (TEM) and [[scanning acoustic microscope]] (SAM) have specialty applications in ceramography.

Ceramography is often done qualitatively, for comparison of the microstructure of a component to a standard for [[quality control]] or [[failure analysis]] purposes.  Three common quantitative analyses of microstructures are grain size, second-[[Phase (matter)|phase]] content and [[porosity]].  Microstructures are measured by the principles of [[stereology]], in which three-dimensional objects are evaluated in 2-D by projections or cross-sections.

Grain size can be measured by the line-fraction or area-fraction methods of [[ASTM]] E112.  In the line-fraction methods, a statistical grain size is calculated from the number of grains or grain boundaries intersecting a line of known length or circle of known circumference.  In the area-fraction method, the grain size is calculated from the number of grains inside a known area.  In each case, the measurement is affected by secondary phases, porosity, [[Texture (crystalline)|preferred orientation]], [[exponential distribution]] of sizes, and non-equiaxed grains.  [[Image analysis]] can measure the [[shape factor (image analysis and microscopy)|shape factor]]s of individual grains by ASTM E1382.

Second-phase content and porosity are measured the same way in a microstructure, such as ASTM E562.  Procedure E562 is a point-fraction method based on the stereological principle of point fraction = volume fraction, i.e., ''P''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = ''V''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;.  Second-phase content in ceramics, such as carbide whiskers in an oxide matrix, is usually expressed as a [[mass]] fraction.  [[Volume]] fractions can be converted to mass fractions if the [[density]] of each phase is known.  Image analysis can measure porosity, pore-size distribution and volume fractions of secondary phases by ASTM E1245.  Porosity measurements do not require etching.  Multi-phase microstructures do not require etching if the [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] between phases is adequate, as is usually the case.

Grain size, porosity and second-phase content have all been [[correlate]]d with ceramic properties such as mechanical strength σ by the [[Hall–Petch]] equation. [[Hardness]], [[toughness]], [[dielectric constant]] and many other properties are microstructure-dependent.

== Microindention hardness and toughness==&lt;!-- [[Vickers hardness test]] links to here --&gt;
[[File:Knoop_A995.JPG|thumb|Knoop indention (P=1kg) in 99.5% alumina]]
[[File:Tough_A96.JPG|thumb|Toughness indention (P=10kg) in 96% alumina]]

The hardness of a material can be measured in many ways.  The [[Knoop hardness test]], a method of microindention hardness, is the most reproducible for dense ceramics.  The [[Vickers hardness test]] and superficial [[Rockwell scale]]s (e.g., 45N) can also be used, but tend to cause more surface damage than Knoop.  The Brinell test is suitable for ductile metals, but not ceramics.  In the Knoop test, a diamond indenter in the shape of an elongated pyramid is forced into a polished (but not etched) surface under a predetermined load, typically 500 or 1000 g.  The load is held for some amount of time, say 10 s, and the indenter is retracted.  The indention long diagonal (''d'', [[Micrometre|μm]], in Fig. 4) is measured under a microscope, and the Knoop hardness (HK) is calculated from the load (P, [[Gram|g]]) and the square of the diagonal length in the equations below.  The constants account for the projected area of the indenter and unit conversion factors.  Most oxide ceramics have a Knoop hardness in the range of 1000&amp;ndash;1500 [[Kilogram-force|kg&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;]]/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (10 &amp;ndash; 15 G[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]), and many carbides are over 2000 (20 GPa).  The method is specified in ASTM C849, C1326 &amp; E384.  Microindention hardness is also called micro[[indentation hardness]] or simply microhardness.  The hardness of very small particles and thin films of ceramics, on the order of 100 nm, can be measured by [[nanoindentation]] methods that use a [[Berkovich tip|Berkovich]] indenter.
:&lt;math&gt;HK = 14229 \frac{P}{d^2}&lt;/math&gt; (kg&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;HK = 139.54 \frac{P}{d^2}&lt;/math&gt; (GPa)

The toughness of ceramics can be determined from a Vickers test under a load of 10 &amp;ndash; 20&amp;nbsp;kg.  [[Fracture toughness|Toughness]] is the ability of a material to resist  crack [[Fracture mechanics|propagation]].  Several calculations have been formulated from the load (P), [[elastic modulus]] (E), microindention hardness (H), [[Fracture|crack]] length&lt;ref&gt;G.R. Anstis ''et al.'', "A Critical Evaluation of Indentation Techniques for Measuring Fracture Toughness: I, Direct Crack Measurements," ''J. Am. Ceram. Soc.'', '''64''' [9] p 533–538 (Sep 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; (''c'' in Fig. 5) and [[flexural strength]] (σ).&lt;ref&gt;P. Chantikul ''et al.'', "A Critical Evaluation of Indentation Techniques for Measuring Fracture Toughness: II, Strength Method," ''J. Am. Ceram. Soc.'', '''64''' [9] p 539–543 (Sep 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;  Modulus of rupture (MOR) bars with a rectangular cross-section are indented in three places on a polished surface. The bars are loaded in 4-point bending with the polished, indented surface in tension, until fracture.  The fracture normally originates at one of the indentions.  The crack lengths are measured under a microscope.  The toughness of most ceramics is 2&amp;ndash;4 MPa{{radic|m}}, but toughened zirconia is as much as 13, and [[cemented carbide]]s are often over 20.&lt;ref&gt;D.W. Richerson, ''Modern Ceramic Engineering'', 2nd Ed., Marcel Dekker Inc., 1992, {{ISBN|0-8247-8634-3}}, p 741.&lt;/ref&gt; The toughness-by-indention methods have been discredited recently and are being replaced by more rigorous methods that measure crack growth in a notched [[Beam (structure)|beam]] in [[flexure]].&lt;ref&gt;G.D. Quinn &amp; R.C. Bradt, "On the Vickers Indentation Fracture Toughness Test," ''J. Am. Ceram. Soc.'', '''90''' [3] p 673–680 (Mar 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;K_{icl} = 0.016 \sqrt{\frac{E}{H}}\frac{P}{(c_0)^{1.5}}&lt;/math&gt; initial crack length
:&lt;math&gt;K_{isb} = 0.59 \left(\frac{E}{H}\right)^{1/8}[\sigma (P^{1/3})]^{3/4}&lt;/math&gt; indention strength in bending

The '''Chechnya Spetsnaz base explosion''' was the February 8, 2006, blast at the [[Russia]]n [[Defense Ministry]]'s special security unit [[barracks]] at [[Kurchaloi]] near [[Grozny]], [[Chechnya]], which killed at least 13 [[Spetsnaz|Russian special forces]] troops and injured 28 more, according to the official statement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2006/02/mil-060208-rferl03.htm Death Toll In Chechen Explosion Rises To 13], RFE/RL, 8 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2006/02/08/welcome.htm At least 12 die in blast at Russian military base in Chechnya] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222458/http://www.dawn.com/2006/02/08/welcome.htm |date=September 27, 2007 }}, DAWN, February 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

The two-story building, which collapsed, housed unit of about 200 [[GRU]] servicemen, of which some 43 were believed to have been inside at the time of the explosion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5451">'''Chip formation''' is part of the process of cutting materials by mechanical means, using tools such as [[saw]]s, [[lathe]]s and [[milling machine|milling]] cutters. An understanding of the theory and engineering of this formation is an important part of the development of such machines and their cutting tools.

The formal study of chip formation was encouraged around [[World War II]] and shortly afterwards, with increases in the use of faster and more powerful cutting machines, particularly for metal cutting with the new [[high speed steel]] cutters. Pioneering work in this field was carried out by Kivima (1952) and Franz (1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Chip formation is usually described according to a three-way model developed by Franz. This model is best known within the field of machine tool design, although it is also used when an application area, such as [[woodworking]], requires a vocabulary to describe chip formation in more detail than is usually attempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Chip classification ==
The first three chip types are the original characterisation, by Dr. Norman Franz. The type of chip that forms depends on many factors, of both tool and material. In general, main factors are the angle formed by the edge faces of the tool and also the angle at which this is presented to the surface.

Sharpness of the cutting tool does not usually define the ''type'' of chip, but rather the ''quality'' of the chip, and the clear distinctions between types. A blunt tool produces a degenerate chip that is large, torn and varies from one means of formation to another, often leaving behind a poor quality surface where this means changes.

=== {{visible anchor|Type I chip}} ===
[[File:Chip formation Type I.svg|thumb|Type I chip]]
Type I chips form when a material splits ''ahead'' of the cutting edge, owing to some upwards wedge action of the tool exceeding the [[tensile strength|''tensile'' strength]] of the material, perpendicular to the surface. They are thus particularly important in fibrous materials, such as wood, where individual fibres are strong but they may be levered apart relatively easily. Type I chips generally form in cutting by tools with shallow cutting angles.

Type I chips may form long, continuous [[swarf]], limited in size only by the length of cut.

This is the idealised chip formation for [[wood shaving]]s,&lt;ref name="Elliott, Wood shavings" /&gt; particularly those produced by a well-tuned [[plane (tool)|plane]] with a finely adjusted mouth.

=== {{visible anchor|Type II chip}} ===
[[File:Chip formation Type II.svg|thumb|Type II chip]]
Type II chips form when a shearing force is produced by the wedge of the tool angle. The material fails along a short angled plane, from the apex of the tool edge, diagonally upwards and forwards to the surface. The material deforms along this line, forming an upward curling chip. These chips generally form from intermediate cutting angles.

Type II chips may form in ductile materials, such as metals.

Type II chips may also form long, continuous [[swarf]].

=== {{visible anchor|Type III chip}} ===
[[File:Climb Milling 01.png|thumb|Type III chip formation during [[Milling cutter|climb milling]]]]
Type III chips form a compression failure of the material, ahead of a relatively obtuse cutting angle, approaching 90°. In some weak or non-ductile materials this may form an acceptable chip, usually as a fine dust, but often it gives rise instead to a random "snowplough" effect where the waste material is bunched up ahead of the tool but not cleared decisively away as a well-formed chip.

This type of chip is formed by [[router (woodworking)|router]]s. It is also formed by woodworking scrapers, although when properly sharpened and used, these form such a thin Type III chip that it instead appears as a well-formed Type II chip. Their waste chip is thin enough that the compression failure volume is small enough to act as for the well-defined shear plane of the Type II.

=== {{visible anchor|Type 0 chip}} ===
This type was characterised later, by William McKenzie (1960).{{efn-lr|McKenzie also used the terms Type I and Type II chips, although confusingly these are not the same as Franz'.}}

'''Cryosurgery''' is the use of extreme cold in [[surgery]] to destroy abnormal or diseased tissue;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dermnetnz.org/procedures/cryotherapy.html|title=Cryotherapy - DermNet New Zealand|website=dermnetnz.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus, it is the surgical application of [[cryoablation]]. The term comes from the Greek words '''cryo''' (κρύο) ("icy cold") and '''surgery''' (''cheirourgiki'' – χειρουργική) meaning "hand work" or "handiwork".
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Cryosurgerym.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|[[Cryosurgery]]&lt;ref&gt;http://visualsonline.cancer.gov/retrieve.cfm?imageid=7293&amp;dpi=72&amp;fileformat=jpg&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;
Cryosurgery has been historically used to treat a number of diseases and disorders, especially [[List of skin diseases|a variety of benign and malignant skin conditions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1125851-overview|title=Cryotherapy: Overview, Mechanism of Action, Treatment Modalities Using Cryotherapy|date=1 June 2016|publisher=|via=eMedicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
[[Image:Wart cryotherapy.jpg|right|100px|thumb|Cryotherapy to a [[plantar wart]] using cotton bud application]]

[[Wart]]s, [[mole (skin marking)|moles]], [[skin tag]]s, [[solar keratosis|solar keratoses]], [[Morton's neuroma]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.podiatrytoday.com/closer-look-cryosurgery-neuromas|title=A Closer Look At Cryosurgery For Neuromas - Podiatry Today|website=www.podiatrytoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and small [[skin cancer]]s are candidates for cryosurgical treatment. Several [[internal medicine|internal disorders]] are also treated with cryosurgery, including [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]], [[prostate cancer]], lung cancer, oral cancers, [[Cervix|cervical]] disorders and, more commonly in the past, [[hemorrhoids]]. Soft tissue conditions such as [[plantar fasciitis]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.podiatrytoday.com/article/7883 |Case Studies in Cryosurgery for Heel Pain&lt;/ref&gt; (jogger's heel) and [[fibroma]] (benign excrescence of connective tissue) can be treated with cryosurgery. 
Generally, all tumors that can be reached by the cryoprobes used during an operation are treatable. Although found to be effective, this method of treatment is only appropriate for use against localized disease, and solid tumors larger than 1&amp;nbsp;cm. Tiny, diffuse [[metastases]] that often coincide with cancers are usually not affected by cryotherapy.

Cryosurgery works by taking advantage of the destructive force of freezing temperatures on [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. When their [[temperature]] sinks beyond a certain level [[ice crystal]]s begin forming inside the cells and, because of their lower [[density]], eventually tear apart those cells. Further harm to malignant growth will result once the [[blood vessel]]s supplying the affected tissue begin to freeze.

== Method ==

=== Liquid nitrogen===
[[Image:Cryogun.jpg|right|thumb|Cryogun used to spray liquid nitrogen]]
A common method of freezing lesions is using [[liquid nitrogen]] as the cooling solution. This {{convert|-196|°C|0}} cold liquid may be sprayed on the diseased tissue, circulated through a tube called a cryoprobe, or simply dabbed on with a cotton or foam swab.

=== Carbon dioxide ===
Carbon dioxide is also available as a spray and is used to treat a variety of benign spots. Less frequently, doctors use [[carbon dioxide]] "snow" formed into a cylinder or mixed with [[acetone]] to form a slush that is applied directly to the treated tissue.

=== Argon===
Recent advances in technology have allowed for the use of [[argon]] gas to drive ice formation using a principle known as the [[Joule-Thomson effect]]. This gives physicians excellent control of the ice, and minimizing complications using ultra-thin 17 [[Stubs Iron Wire Gauge|gauge]] cryoneedles.

=== Freeze sprays ===
A mixture of [[dimethyl ether]] and [[propane]] is used in some "[[freeze spray]]" preparations such as [[Dr. Scholl's]] Freeze Away.  The mixture is stored in an [[aerosol spray]] type container at room temperature and drops to {{convert|-41|C|F}} when dispensed.  The mixture is often dispensed into a straw with a cotton-tipped swab. Similar products may use [[tetrafluoroethane]] or other substances.

== Products ==
{{noref|section|date=November 2017}}
;Cryosurgical systems
A number of medical supply companies have developed [[cryogen]] delivery systems for cryosurgery. Most are based on the use of liquid nitrogen, although some employ the use of proprietary mixtures of gases that combine to form the cryogen.

==In cancer treatment==
Cryosurgery is also used to treat internal and external tumors as well as tumors in the bone. To cure internal tumors, a hollow instrument called a cryoprobe is used, which is placed in contact with the tumor. Liquid [[nitrogen]] or [[argon]] gas is passed through the cryoprobe. [[Ultrasound]] or [[MRI]] is used to guide the cryoprobe and monitor the freezing of the cells. This helps in limiting damage to adjacent healthy tissues. A ball of ice crystals forms around the probe which results in freezing of nearby cells. When it is required to deliver gas to various parts of the tumor, more than one probe is used. After cryosurgery, the frozen tissue is either naturally absorbed by the body in the case of internal tumors, or it dissolves and forms a scab for external tumors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/surgery/cryosurgery-fact-sheet|title=Cryosurgery in Cancer Treatment|website=National Cancer Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Results ==
Cryosurgery is a [[minimally invasive]] procedure, and is often preferred to more traditional kinds of surgery because of its minimal pain, scarring, and cost; however, as with any medical treatment, there are risks involved, primarily that of damage to nearby healthy tissue. Damage to [[Nerve|nerve tissue]] is of particular concern.

Patients undergoing cryosurgery usually experience redness and minor-to-moderate localized pain, which most of the time can be alleviated sufficiently by oral administration of mild [[analgesics]] such as [[Ibuprofen]], [[codeine]] or [[acetaminophen]] (paracetamol). [[Blister]]s may form as a result of cryosurgery, but these usually scab over and peel away within a few days.

The '''cyclopropenium ion''' is the cation with the formula {{chem|C|3|H|3|+}}. It attracted attention as the smallest example of an [[aromatic]] [[cation]].  Its salts have been isolated, and many derivatives have been characterized by [[X-ray crystallography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{March6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntheses==
Salts of many cyclopropenyl cations have been characterized.  Their stability varies according to the steric and inductive effects of the substituents.

Salts of triphenylcyclopropenium were first reported by [[Ronald Breslow]] in 1957.  The salt was prepared in two steps starting with the reaction phenyldiazoacetonitrile with [[diphenylacetylene]] to yield 1,2,3-triphenyl-2-cyclopropene nitrile. Treatment of this with [[boron trifluoride]] yielded [C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yadav|first1=Arvind|title=Cyclopropenium Ion|journal=Synlett|year=2012|volume=23|issue=16|pages=2428–2429|doi=10.1055/s-0032-1317230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=breslow&gt;{{cite journal |author = Ronald Breslow|author-link=Ronald Breslow |title = Synthesis of the ''s''-Triphenylcyclopropenyl Cation |year = 1957 |journal = [[J.

The parent cation, [C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, was reported as its [[hexachloroantimonate]] ({{chem|SbCl|6|−}}) salt in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cyclopropenyl Cation.

[[Amino]]-substituted cyclopropenium salts are particularly stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandar |first1=Jeffrey S. |last2=Lambert |first2=Tristan H.|title=Aminocyclopropenium ions: synthesis, properties, and applications|journal=Synthesis |year=2013|volume=45|issue=10|pages=2485–2498}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haley|first1=Michael M.|last2=Gilbertson|first2=Robert D.|last3=Weakley|first3=Timothy J.D.|title=Preparation, X-ray Crystal Structures, and Reactivity of Alkynylcyclopropenylium Salts|journal=Journal of Organic Chemistry|year=2000|volume=65|issue=5|pages=1422–1430|doi=10.1021/jo9915372}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calicene]] is an unusual derivative featuring cyclopropenium linked to a [[cyclopentadienide]].

== Reactions ==
===Organic chemistry===
Chloride salts of cyclopropenium esters are intermediates in the use of dichlorocyclopropenes for the conversion of [[carboxylic acid]]s to [[acid chloride]]s:&lt;ref name="lambert"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hardee|first1=David J.|last2=Kovalchuke|first2=Lyudmila|last3=Lambert|first3=Tristan H.|title=Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution via Aromatic Cation Activation of Carboxylic Acids: Rapid Generation of Acid Chlorides under Mild Conditions|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|year=2010|volume=132|issue=14|pages=5002–5003|doi=10.1021/ja101292a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[File:Acidchloride2.jpg|400px|Formation of acid chloride by cyclopropenium derivative]]

Related cyclopropenium cations are produced in the regeneration of the 1,1-dichlorocyclopropenes from the [[cyclopropenone]]s.

The cyclopropenium chlorides have been applied to peptide bond formation.&lt;ref name=lambert/&gt; For example, in the figure below, reacting a boc-protected amino acid with an unprotected amino acid in the presence of the cyclopropenium ion allows the formation of a [[peptide bond]] via acid chloride formation followed by nucleophilic substitution with the unprotected [[amino acid]].

:[[File:Peptidecyclo2.jpg|650px|Peptide catalysis by cyclopropenium ions]]

This method of mildly generating acid chlorides can also be useful for linking alpha-[[anomeric]] [[monosaccharide|sugar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nogueira|first1=J. M.|last2=Nguyến|first2=S. H.|last3=Bennett|first3=C. S.|title=Cyclopropenium Cation Promoted Dehydrative Glycosylations Using 2-Deoxy- and 2,6-Dideoxy-Sugar Donors|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=13|year=2011|issue=13|pages=2184–2187|doi=10.1021/ol200726v}}&lt;/ref&gt; After using the cyclopropenium ion to form the chloride at the [[anomeric carbon]], the compound is iodinated with [[tetrabutylammonium iodide]]. This iodine can thereafter be substituted by any [[hydroxyl|ROH]] group to quickly undergo alpha-selective linkage of sugars.

Additionally, some synthetic routes make use of cyclopropenium ring openings yielding an [[allylcarbene cation]]. The linear degradation product yields both a nucleophilic and electrophilic carbon centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yoshida|first1=Zen'ichi|last2=Yoneda|first2=Shigeo|last3=Hirai|first3=Hideo|title=A Novel Synthesis of Pyrroles by the Reactions of Tris(alkylthio)cyclopropenium Salt with Amines|journal=Heterocycles|year=1981|volume=15|issue=2|pages=865|doi=10.3987/S-1981-02-0865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many complexes are known with cyclopropenium ligands.  Examples include [M(C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (M = Ni, Pd, Pt) and Co(C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  Such compounds are prepared by reaction of cyclopropenium salts with low valent [[metal complex]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chiang |first1=T. |last2=Kerber |first2=R.

== As polyelectrolytes==
Because many substituted derivatives are known, cyclopropenium salts have attracted attention as possible [[polyelectrolytes]], relevant to technologies such as [[desalination]] and [[fuel cell]]s. The tris(dialkylamino)cyclopropenium salts have been particularly evaluated because of their high stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Yivan|last2=Freyer|first2=Jessica|last3=Cotanda|first3=Pepa|last4=Brucks|first4=Spencer|last5=Killops|first5=Kato|last6=Bandar|first6=Jeffrey|last7=Torsitano|first7=Christopher|last8=Balsara|first8=Nitash|last9=Lambert|first9=Tristan|last10=Campos|first10=Luis|title=The evolution of cyclopropenium ions into functional polyelectrolytes|journal=Nature Communications|volume=6|year=2015|issue=6|pages=1–7|doi=10.1038/ncomms6950|bibcode=2015NatCo...6E5950J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dallol''' ([[Amharic]]: ዳሎል) is a locality in the [[Dallol (woreda)|Dallol woreda]] of northern [[Ethiopia]]. Located in [[Administrative Zone 2 (Afar)|Administrative Zone 2]] of the [[Afar Region]] in the [[Afar Depression]], it has a latitude and longitude of {{Coord|14|14|19|N|40|17|38|E}} with an elevation of about {{convert|130|m}} below sea level. The [[Central Statistical Agency (Ethiopia)|Central Statistical Agency]] has not published an estimate for this settlement's 2005 population; it has been described as a [[ghost town]].

Dallol currently holds the official record for [[Extremes on Earth#Coldest and hottest inhabited places on Earth|record high average temperature for an inhabited location]] on Earth, where an average annual temperature of 35°C (95°F) was recorded between the years 1960 and 1966. Dallol is also one of the most remote places on Earth, although paved roads to the village of Hamedela, which is close, are being built. Still, the most important mode of transport besides jeeps are the [[camel]] caravans which travel to the area to collect salt.

Nearby is the [[Dallol (volcano)|Dallol volcano]], which last erupted in 2011.

== History ==
A railway from the port of Mersa Fatma in [[Eritrea]] to a point 28&amp;nbsp;km from Dallol was completed in April 1918.  Built from 1917-1918, using the 600&amp;nbsp;mm gauge [[Decauville]] system ("Decauville" describes ready-made sections of small-gauge track which can be rapidly assembled) it transported salt from the "Iron Point" rail terminal near Dallol, via Kululli to the port.&lt;ref name=NAI-web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/d/ORTDAK.pdf|title=Local History in Ethiopia|work=The Nordic Africa Institute website|accessdate=1 May 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217170140/http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/d/ORTDAK.pdf|archivedate=17 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mining ===
[[Potash]] production is said to have reached about 51,000 metric tons after the railway was constructed. Production was stopped after World War I owing to large-scale supplies from Germany, USA, and USSR. Unsuccessful attempts to reopen production were made in the period 1920-1941. Between the years 1925-29 an Italian company mined 25,000 tons of [[sylvite]], averaging 70% KCl, which was transported by rail to Mersa Fatma.&lt;ref name=NAI-web/&gt; After the [[Second World War]], the British administration dismantled the railway and removed all traces of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wrong|first=Michela|authorlink=Michela Wrong|title=I Didn't Do It for You: How the World Betrayed a Small African Nation|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|year=2005|page=149f|isbn=978-0060780920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dallol Co. of [[Asmara]] sold a few tons of salt from this site to India in 1951-1953. In the 1960s, the Parsons Company of the USA, a mining company, conducted a series of geological surveys at Dallol. By 1965, about 10,000 holes had been drilled at 65 locations.&lt;ref name=NAI-web/&gt;

Dallol became more known in the West in 2004 when it was featured in the [[Channel 4]]/[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] documentary ''[[Going to Extremes]]''. {{as of|2004}}, some buildings still stand in Dallol, all built with salt blocks.

== Climate ==

Dallol features an extreme version of a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh'') typical of the [[Danakil Desert]]. Dallol is the hottest place year-round on the planet and currently holds the record high average temperature for an inhabited location on Earth, where an average annual temperature of 34.6 °C (94.3 °F) was recorded between the years 1960 and 1966. The annual average high temperature is 41 °C (105 °F) and the hottest month has an average high of 46.7 °C (116.1 °F). In addition to being extremely hot year-round, the climate of the lowlands of the [[Danakil Depression]] is also extremely dry and hyperarid in terms of annual average rainy days as only a few days record measurable precipitation. The hot desert climate of Dallol is particularly due to the extremely low elevation, it being inside the [[tropics]] and near the hot [[Red Sea]] during winters, the very low seasonality impact, the constants of the extreme heat and the lack of nighttime cooling.

[[File:Silver Dirham.png|thumb|Later silver ''dirham'' of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], minted at [[Balkh]] in [[Hijri year|AH]] 111 (= 729/30 [[Common Era|CE]])]]

'''Dirham''', '''dirhem''' or '''dirhm''' (درهم) was and, in some cases, still is a unit of currency in several [[Arab league|Arab states]]. It was formerly the related unit of mass (the Ottoman [[dram (unit)|dram]]) in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and old [[Persia]]n states.

==Unit of mass==
The dirham was a unit of weight used across North Africa, the Middle East, and Persia, with varying values.

In the late Ottoman Empire ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] درهم), the standard dirham was 3.207 [[gram|g]];&lt;ref&gt;based on an oka of 1.2828 [[kilogram|kg]]; Diran Kélékian gives 3.21 g (''Dictionnaire Turc-Français'', Constantinople: Imprimerie Mihran, 1911) ; Γ. Μπαμπινιώτης gives 3.203 g (''Λεξικό της Νέας Ελληνικής Γλώσσας'', Athens, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; 400 dirhem equal one [[oka (measure)|oka]]. The Ottoman dirham was based on the [[Sassanian]] drachm, which was itself based on the Roman dram/drachm.

In [[Egypt]] in 1895, it was equivalent to 47.661 [[troy grain]]s (3.088 [[gram|g]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is currently a movement within the Islamic world to revive the [[Islamic dirham|Dirham]] as a unit of mass for measuring silver, although the exact value is disputed (either '''3 grams or 2.975 grams'''){{citation needed|date=February 2013}}.

==History==
[[File:Silver hoard from Lublin-Czechów.jpg|thumb|250px|Silver hoard from [[Lublin]]-Czechów, comprising 214 silver dirhams issued between 711/712 and 882/883 AD, [[Lublin Museum]].]]
The word "dirham" is an Arabic word from the Ancient Greek "drachma" which was originally a gold coin. Near the end of the 7th century the coin became an Islamic currency bearing the name of the sovereign and a religious verse. The dirham was struck in many [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean countries]], including [[Al-Andalus]] ([[Moors|Moorish]] [[Spain]]) and the [[Byzantine Empire]] (''[[miliaresion]]''), and could be used as currency in [[Europe]] between the 10th and 12th centuries, notably in areas with [[Viking]] connections, such as [[Jorvik|Viking York]]&lt;ref&gt;In addition to Islamic ''dirhams'' in ninth and tenth century English hoards, a counterfeit ''dirham'' was found at [[Jorvik Viking Centre|Coppergate, York]], struck as if for [[Ismail Samani|Isma'il ibn Achmad]] (ruling at Samarkand, 903-07/8), of [[Fourée|copper covered by a once-silvery wash of tin]] (illustrated in Richard Hall, ''Viking Age Archaeology'', [series Shire Archaeology] 2010:17, fig. 7).&lt;/ref&gt; and Dublin.
===Dirham in Jewish orthodox law===
The ''dirham'' is frequently mentioned in [[Jewish]] [[Halakha|orthodox law]] as a unit of weight used to measure various requirements in religious functions, such as the weight in silver specie pledged in Marriage Contracts (''[[Ketubbah]]''), the quantity of flour requiring the separation of the [[Hallah (Talmud)|dough-portion]], etc. Jewish physician and philosopher, [[Maimonides]], uses the Egyptian ''dirham'' to approximate the quantity of flour for [[Hallah (Talmud)|dough-portion]], writing in [[Mishnah]] ''[[Eduyot]]'' 1:2: "...And I found the rate of the dough-portion in that measurement to be approximately five-hundred and twenty ''dirhams'' of wheat flour, while all these dirhams are the Egyptian [''dirham'']." This view is repeated by [[Yosef Karo|Maran]]'s ''[[Shulhan Arukh]]'' (''Hil. Hallah'', [[Yoreh Deah]] § 324:3) in the name of the [[Arba'ah Turim|Tur]]. In Maimonides' commentary of the Mishnah (''Eduyot'' 1:2, note 18), Rabbi [[Yosef Qafih]] explains that the weight of each Egyptian ''dirham'' was approximately 3.333 grammes,&lt;ref&gt;''Mishnah - with a Commentary of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'', ed. Yosef Qafih, vol. 2 - ''Seder Neziqim'', pub. [[Mossad Harav Kook]]: Jerusalem 1965, p. 189 (Hebrew title: '''משנה עם פירוש הרמב"ם''')&lt;/ref&gt;  or what was the equivalent to 16 [[carob]]-grains&lt;ref&gt;''Mishnah - with a Commentary of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'' (ed. [[Yosef Qafih]]), vol. 3, [[Mossad Harav Kook]]: Jerusalem 1967, s.v. Introduction to Tractate ''Menahoth'', p. 68 (note 35) (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; which, when taken together, the minimum weight of flour requiring the separation of the dough-portion comes to approx. 1 kilo and 733 grammes. Rabbi [[Ovadiah Yosef]], in his ''Sefer Halikhot ʿOlam'' (vol. 1, pp. 288-291),&lt;ref&gt;Ovadiah Yosef, ''Sefer Halikhot ʿOlam'', vol. 1, Jerusalem 2002 (Hebrew title: '''ספר הליכות עולם''')&lt;/ref&gt; makes use of a different standard for the Egyptian ''dirham'', saying that it weighed approx. 3.0 grammes, meaning the minimum requirement for separating the [[Kohen|priest]]'s portion is 1 kilo and 560 grammes. Others (e.g. Rabbi [[Avraham Chaim Naeh]]) say the Egyptian ''dirham'' weighed approx. 3.205 grammes,&lt;ref&gt;Ovadiah Yosef, ''Sefer Halikhot ʿOlam'', vol. 1, Jerusalem 2002, p. 288, sec. 11; Abraham Chaim Naeh, [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/37746 ''Sefer Kuntres ha-Shi'urim''], Jerusalem 1943, p. 4 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; which total weight for the requirement of separating the dough-portion comes to 1 kilo and 666 grammes. Rabbi Shelomo Qorah (Chief Rabbi of [[Bnei Barak]]) writes that the traditional weight used in [[Yemen]] for each ''dirham'' weighed 3.36 grammes,&lt;ref&gt;Shelomo Qorah, ''ʿArikhat Shūlḥan - Yilqūṭ Ḥayyīm'', vol. 13 (Principles of Instruction and Tradition), Benei Barak 2012, p. 206 (Hebrew title: '''עריכת שולחן - ילקוט חיים''')&lt;/ref&gt; making the total weight for the required separation of the dough-portion to be 1 kilo and 770.72 grammes.

The word ''drachmon'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''דרכמון'''}}), used in some translations of Maimonides' commentary of the [[Mishnah]], has in all places the same connotation as ''dirham''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mishnah - with a Commentary of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'', ed. Yosef Qafih, vol. 3 - ''Seder Kodashim'', pub. [[Mossad Harav Kook]]: Jerusalem 1967, s.v. Introduction to Tractate ''Menahoth'', p. 68 (note 35) (Hebrew title: '''משנה עם פירוש הרמב"ם''')&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern-day currency ==
Currently the valid national currencies with the name ''dirham'' are :

* the [[Moroccan dirham]]
* the [[United Arab Emirates dirham]]
* the [[Armenian dram]]

Modern currencies with the subdivision ''dirham'' or ''diram'' are:
* 1 [[Libyan dinar]] is subdivided into 1,000 Dirham
* 1 [[Qatari riyal]] is subdivided into 100 Dirham
* 1 [[Jordanian dinar]] is subdivided into 10 Dirham
* 1 [[Tajikistani somoni]] is subdivided into 100 Diram

Also the unofficial [[modern gold dinar]] is divided into dirham.

'''East Carpathians Protected Landscape Area''' ({{lang-sk|Chránená krajinná oblasť Východné Karpaty}}) is a [[Protected areas of Slovakia#Protected Landscape Areas|protected landscape area]] in north-eastern [[Slovakia]], in the [[Prešov Region]], in the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. The PLA occupies a slice of land along with the border with [[Poland]]. The park was first created in 1977, when it was originally larger than today, occupying area of 968.1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (373.8&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi) until 1997, when the [[Poloniny National Park]] was created in the eastern part, reducing the area into 253.07&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (97.7&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi).

==Biology==
[[Beech]] forests are dominant in the park, with the corresponding plant and animal associations. Original growth forests constitute an ideal environment for protected or threatened species, such as the [[gray wolf]], [[lynx]], [[bear]], [[otter]] and others.

A primary source of funding for research on liquid electrofuels for transportation is the Electrofuels Program of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), headed by Eric Toone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-programs/electrofuels |title=ELECTROFUELS: Microorganisms for Liquid Transportation Fuel |publisher=ARPA-E |accessdate=July 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARPA-E, created in 2009 under President Obama’s Secretary of Energy [[Steven Chu]], is the Department of Energy’s (DOE) attempt to duplicate the effectiveness of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, [[DARPA]].  Examples of projects funded under this program include OPX Biotechnologies’ biodiesel effort led by Michael Lynch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-projects/engineering-bacteria-efficient-fuel-production |title=Novel Biological Conversion of Hydrogen and Carbon Dioxide Directly into Free Fatty Acids |publisher=ARPA-E |accessdate=July 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010053204/http://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-projects%2Fengineering-bacteria-efficient-fuel-production |archivedate=October 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Derek Lovley’s work on [[microbial electrosynthesis]] at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-projects/biofuels-solar-energy-and-bacteria-0 |title=Electrofuels Via Direct Electron Transfer from Electrodes to Microbes |publisher=ARPA-E |accessdate=July 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010052121/http://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-projects%2Fbiofuels-solar-energy-and-bacteria-0 |archivedate=October 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which reportedly produced the first liquid electrofuel using [[CO2]] as the [[feedstock]]. Descriptions of all ARPA-E Electrofuels Program research projects can be found at the ARPA-E Electrofuels Program website.

The first Electrofuels Conference, sponsored by the [[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]] was held in [[Providence, RI]] in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiche.org/sbe/conferences/conference-electrofuels-research/2011 |title=SBE's Conference on Electrofuels Research |accessdate=July 23, 2013 |publisher=American Institute of Chemical Engineers }}&lt;/ref&gt; At that conference, Director Eric Toone stated that "Eighteen months into the program, we know it works. We need to know if we can make it matter." Several groups are beyond proof-of-principle, and are working to scale up cost-effectively.

Electrofuels have the potential to be disruptive if carbon-neutral electrofuels can be cheaper than [[petroleum fuel]]s, and chemical feedstocks produced by electrosynthesis cheaper than those refined from crude oil. Electrofuels also have a great potential to alter the renewable energy landscape, as electrofuels allow renewables from all sources to be stored conveniently as a liquid fuel.

{{As of|2014}}, prompted by the [[Shale gas in the United States|fracking boom]], ARPA-E's focus has moved from electrical feedstocks to natural-gas based feedstocks, and thus away from electrofuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Scientific American |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fracking-hammers-clean-energy-research/ |last=Biello |first=David |title=Fracking Hammers Clean Energy Research |date=March 20, 2014 |accessdate=April 14, 2014 |quote=The cheap natural gas freed from shale by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) has helped kill off bleeding-edge programs like Electrofuels, a bid to use microbes to turn cheap electricity into liquid fuels, and ushered in programs like REMOTE, a bid to use microbes to turn cheap natural gas into liquid fuels.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Esso Longford gas explosion''' was a catastrophic [[industrial accident]] which occurred at the [[Esso]] [[Natural gas processing|natural gas plant]] at [[Longford, Victoria|Longford]] in the [[Australia]]n state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]'s [[Gippsland]] region. On 25 September 1998, an [[explosion]] took place at the [[Chemical plant|plant]], killing two workers and injuring eight. [[Natural gas|Gas]] supplies to the state of Victoria were severely affected for two weeks.

==Context==
In 1998, the Longford gas plant was owned by a joint partnership between [[Esso]] and BHP. Esso was responsible for the operation of the plant. Esso was a wholly owned subsidiary of US based company Exxon, which has since merged with Mobil, becoming [[ExxonMobil]]. BHP has since merged with UK based Billiton becoming [[BHP Billiton]].

Built in 1969, the plant at Longford is the onshore receiving point for oil and [[natural gas]] output from production platforms in [[Bass Strait]]. The Longford Gas Plant Complex consists of three [[Natural gas processing|gas processing]] plants and one [[crude oil]] stabilisation plant. It was the primary provider of natural gas to Victoria, and provided some supply to [[New South Wales]].

==Normal processing procedure==
The feed from the Bass Strait platforms consists of liquid and gaseous [[hydrocarbons]], [[water]] ([[Hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[Oxygen|O]]) and [[hydrogen sulfide]] ([[Hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[Sulfur|S]]). The water and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S are removed before reaching the plant, leaving a hydrocarbon stream to be the feed to Gas Plant 1. This stream contained both gaseous and liquid components. The liquid component was known as "[[natural gas condensate|condensate]]". The [[Liquified Petroleum Gas|LPG]] is further extracted by means of a [[shell and tube heat exchanger]], in which heated "lean oil" and cold "rich oil" (oil which has absorbed LPG) are pumped into the exchanger, cooling the lean oil and heating the rich oil.

==Explosion at Longford==
During the morning of Friday 25 September 1998, a pump supplying heated lean oil to heat exchanger GP905 in Gas Plant No. 1 went offline for four hours, due to an increase in flow from the Marlin Gas Field which caused an overflow of condensate in the [[absorber]]. (The plant was complex and the hot oil pump was only one component involved in the accident process; why the pump shut down is complicated and important.)

A [[heat exchanger]] is a vessel that allows the [[heat transfer|transfer of heat]] from a hot stream to a cold stream, and so does not operate at a single [[temperature]], but experiences a range of temperatures throughout the vessel. Temperatures throughout GP905 normally ranged from 60&amp;nbsp;°C   to 230&amp;nbsp;°C (140&amp;nbsp;°F   to 446&amp;nbsp;°F). Investigators estimated that, due to the failure of the lean oil pump, parts of GP905 experienced temperatures as low as {{convert|-48|°C|°F|0}}. Ice had formed on the unit, and it was decided to resume pumping heated lean oil in to thaw it. When the lean oil pump resumed operation, it pumped oil into the heat exchanger at {{convert|230|°C|°F|0}}—the temperature differential caused a [[brittle fracture]] in the exchanger (GP905) at 12.26pm.

About 10 metric tonnes of hydrocarbon vapour were immediately vented from the [[wikt:rupture|rupture]]. A [[vapour]] cloud formed and drifted downwind. When it reached a set of heaters 170 metres away, it ignited. This caused a [[deflagration]] (a burning vapour cloud). The flame front burnt its way through the vapour cloud, without causing an explosion. When the flamefront reached the rupture in the heat exchanger, a fierce jet fire developed that lasted for two days.

The rupture of GP905 led to other releases and minor fires. The main fire was an intense jet fire emanating from GP905. There was no blast wave—the nearby control room was undamaged. Damage was localised to the immediate area around and above the GP905 exchanger.

Peter Wilson and John Lowery were killed in the accident and eight others were injured.

==Aftermath==
The fire at the plant was not extinguished until two days later. The Longford plant was shut down immediately, and the state of Victoria was left without its primary gas supplier. Within days, [[VENCorp]] shut down the state's entire gas supply. The resulting gas supply shortage was devastating to Victoria's economy, crippling industry and the commercial sector (in particular, the hospitality industry which relied on natural gas for cooking). Loss to industry during the crisis was estimated at around [[A$]]1.3 billion.

As natural gas was also widely used in houses in Victoria for cooking, water heating and home heating, many Victorians endured 20 days without gas, hot-water or heating.

Gas supplies to Victoria resumed on 14 October. Many Victorians were outraged and upset to discover only minor compensation on their next gas bill, with the average compensation figure being only around $10.

==Royal Commission==
A [[Royal Commission]] was called into the explosion at Longford, headed by former [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] judge [[Daryl Dawson]]. The Commission sat for 53 days, commencing with a preliminary hearing on 12 November 1998 and concluding with a closing address by Counsel Assisting the Royal Commission on 15 April 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/papers/govpub/VPARL1998-99No61.pdf| title=The Esso Longford Gas Plant Accident| work=Report of the Longford Royal Commission| date=June 1999| first1=Sir Daryl Michael| last1=Dawson| first2=Brian John| last2=Brooks| publisher=Government Printer for the State of Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Esso blamed the accident on worker negligence, in particular Jim Ward, one of the panel workers on duty on the day of the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.futuremedia.com.au/docs/Lessons%20from%20Longford%20by%20Hopkins.PDF| title=Lessons from Esso's Gas Plant Explosion at Longford| first=Andrew| last=Hopkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The findings of the Royal Commission, however, cleared Ward of any negligence or wrongdoing. Instead, the Commission found Esso fully responsible for the accident:

:''The causes of the accident on 25 September 1998 amounted to a failure to provide and maintain so far as practicable a working environment that was safe and without risks to health. This constituted a breach or breaches of Section 21 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985.''

Other findings of the Royal Commission included:
*the Longford plant was poorly designed, and made isolation of dangerous vapours and materials very difficult;
*inadequate training of personnel in normal operating procedures of a hazardous process;
*excessive alarm and warning systems had caused workers to become desensitised to possible hazardous occurrences;
*the relocation of plant engineers to [[Melbourne]] had reduced the quality of supervision at the plant;
*poor communication between shifts meant that the pump shutdown was not communicated to the following shift.

Certain managerial shortcomings were also identified:
*the company had neglected to commission a [[Hazard and operability study|HAZOP]] (HAZard and OPerability) analysis of the heat exchange system, which would almost certainly have highlighted the risk of tank rupture caused by sudden temperature change;
*Esso's two-tiered reporting system (from operators to supervisors to management) meant that certain warning signs such as a previous similar incident (on 28 August) were not reported to the appropriate parties;
*the company's safety culture was more oriented towards preventing lost time due to accidents or injuries, rather than protection of workers and their health.

==Legal ramifications==
Esso was taken to the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]] by the Victorian WorkCover Authority. The jury found the company guilty of eleven breaches of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985, and Justice Philip Cummins imposed a record fine of $2 million in July 2001.

In addition, a class action was taken on behalf of businesses, industries and domestic users who were financially affected by the gas crisis. The class action went to trial in the Supreme Court on 4 September 2002, and was eventually settled in December 2004 when Esso was ordered to pay $32.5 million to businesses which suffered property damage as a result of the incident.

Following the Longford accident, Victoria introduced [[Major hazard facility|Major Hazard Facilities]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/PubLawToday.nsf/8d7b8bff8129f677ca256da50082e1c7/07ae2a3bdc68c580ca256ff1000aa4ac!OpenDocument Major Hazard Facilities] www.legislation.vic.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt; regulations to regulate safety at plants that contain major chemical hazards. These regulations impose a so-called "non-prescriptive" regime on facility operators, requiring them to "demonstrate" control of major chemical hazards via the use of a Safety Management System and a Safety Case.

Other states have also implemented similar regulatory regimes.

'''Fault breccia''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˈ|b|r|ɛ|tʃ|i|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɛ|ʃ|i|ə}}; Italian for "breach"), or '''tectonic breccia''', is a [[breccia]] (a [[rock (geology)|rock]] type consisting of angular [[clast]]s) that was formed by [[tectonics|tectonic]] forces.

Fault breccia is a [[tectonite]] formed by localized zone of [[brittle deformation]] (a [[fault (geology)|fault zone]]) in a rock.

==Origin==
Fault breccias are tectonites formed primarily by tectonic movement along a localized zone of [[brittle deformation]] (a [[fault (geology)|fault zone]]) in a rock formation or province.

The grinding and milling occurring when the two sides of the fault zone moving along each other results in a material that is made of loose fragments. Because of this fragmentation fault zones are easily infiltrated by [[groundwater]].

Secondary minerals such as [[calcite]], [[epidote]], [[quartz]] or [[talc]] can [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] from the circulating groundwater filling the voids and cementing the rock. However, when the tectonic movement along the fault zone continues the cement itself can be fragmented leading to a new gouge material containing neoformed clasts.

Deeper in the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]], where temperatures and pressures are higher, the rocks in the fault zone can still brecciate, but they keep their internal cohesion. The resulting type of rock is called a [[cataclasite]].

== Properties ==
Fault breccia has no [[Cohesion (geology)|cohesion]]; it is normally an [[consolidation (soil)|unconsolidated]] rock type, unless [[Cementation (geology)|cementation]] took place at a later stage. Sometimes a distinction is made between [[fault gouge]] and fault breccia, the first has a smaller [[grain size]].&lt;ref&gt;Twiss, R.J. &amp; Moores, E.M., 2000 (6th edition): ''Structural Geology'', W.H. Freeman &amp; co, {{ISBN|0-7167-2252-6}}; p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Zones of fault breccia and fault gouge in rocks can be a hazard for the construction of [[tunnel]]s and [[Mining|mines]], as the non-cohesive zones form weak places in the rock where a tunnel can collapse more easily.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3450">'''Ferropericlase''' or '''magnesiowüstite''' is a [[magnesium]]/[[iron]] [[oxide]] ((Mg,Fe)O) that is interpreted to be one of the main constituents of the Earth's lower [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] together with [[silicate perovskite]], a magnesium/iron [[silicate]] with a [[Perovskite (structure)|perovskite structure]]. Ferropericlase has been found as [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]] in a few natural [[diamonds]]. An unusually high iron content in one suite of diamonds has been associated with an origin from the lowermost mantle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gac.esd.mun.ca/GAC_2006/search_abs/sub_program.asp?sess=98&amp;form=10&amp;abs_no=301 Kopylova, M.G. 2006.

==Spin transition zone==
Changes in the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] state of [[electrons]] in iron in mantle minerals has been studied experimentally in ferropericlase. Samples are subject to the conditions of the lower mantle in a [[laser]]-heated [[diamond anvil cell]] and the spin-state is measured using  [[synchrotron]] [[High energy X-rays|X-ray]] [[X-ray spectroscopy|spectroscopy]]. Results indicate that the change from a high to low [[Electron magnetic moment|spin state]] in iron occurs with increasing depth over a range from 1000&amp;nbsp;km to 2200&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2007/NR-07-09-03.html Researchers locate mantle’s spin transition zone, leading to clues about earth’s structure&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527235247/https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2007/NR-07-09-03.html |date=2010-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The change in spin state is expected to be associated with a higher than expected increase in [[density]] with depth.

The '''Ford Taurus''' is an [[automobile]] manufactured by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in the [[United States]].  Now in its sixth generation, it was originally introduced in the 1986 model year, and has remained in near-continuous production for more than three decades.  It has had a [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]]-branded twin, the [[Mercury Sable|Sable]] (1986–2005; 2008–2009), as well as a performance variant, the [[Ford Taurus SHO]] (1989–1999 and 2010–); in addition, it served as the basis for the first-ever [[front-wheel drive]] [[Lincoln Continental]] (1988–2002).  It was a front-wheel drive [[mid-size car|mid-size]] sedan until 2000 (when it was classified as full-sized)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/bymodel/2000_Ford_Taurus.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;, although it remained mid-sized as a station wagon until 2007; the nameplate has been registered to a "global" [[full-size car]] (built on the [[Ford D3 platform]]) since 2008, and available in front- or [[all-wheel drive]] since 2008.

The original Taurus was a milestone for Ford and the entire [[Automotive industry in the United States|American automotive industry]], being the first automobile at Ford designed and manufactured using the [[statistical process control]] ideas brought to Ford by [[W. Edwards Deming]], a prominent statistician consulted by Ford to bring a "culture of quality" to the enterprise. The Taurus had an influential design that brought many new features and innovations to the marketplace.&lt;ref name = "Taub" /&gt; Since its launch in 1986, Ford had built 7,519,919 Tauruses through the 2007 model year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ford-taurus.org/taurusinfo/Specs/Production.php |title=Production Figures |work=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |accessdate=September 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the fifth-best-selling North American nameplate in Ford's history; only the [[Ford F-series|F-150]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = O'Neil | first = Mike| date = | url = http://www.ford-trucks.com/news/idx/12/247/2005/article/01122005 | title = Ford's F-series sets industry sales truck records| publisher = Ford Trucks.com | accessdate = April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ford Escort (North America)|Escort]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=July 21, 2000 |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=5429 |title=Farewell, Ford Escort |publisher=Media.Ford.com |accessdate=April 4, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504030827/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=5429 |archivedate=May 4, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ford Model T|Model T]],&lt;ref name="ford"&gt;{{cite web | last = O'Neill | first = Mike | date = May 5, 2004 | url = http://media.ford.com/newsroom/feature_display.cfm?release=17697 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015154444/http://media.ford.com/newsroom/feature_display.cfm?release=17697 | archivedate = October 15, 2007 | title = Ford Nameplates join Five Million Club | publisher = Media.Ford.com | accessdate = April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]]&lt;ref name = "ford" /&gt; have sold more units.

Johnson, Chicago Now, October 29, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, sales of the Taurus declined as it lost market share to Japanese midsize sedans and as Ford shifted resources towards developing [[SUV]]s.

However, Ford revived the Taurus name during the 2007 [[Chicago Auto Show]] a few months later by renaming two new models that had been intended to be updated versions of the Five Hundred and the Freestyle, the "2008 Taurus" and "2008 Taurus X", respectively.&lt;ref name="DETROIT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=25372 |title=2008 Ford Taurus features more power, style, and more standard safety features |publisher=Media.

== Taurus and the Quality Culture at Ford==

The Taurus was the first car resulting from introduction of a new quality culture at Ford. Between 1979 and 1982, Ford had incurred $3 billion in losses. In the Spring of 1980, Ford Chairman Donald E. Peterson initiated a new "team" approach to the design and manufacture of automobiles at Ford, that eventually resulted in the creation of the Ford Taurus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-06-04-8602090462-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; Ford's newly appointed Corporate Quality Director, Larry Moore, was charged with recruiting the famous statistician, [[W. Edwards Deming]] to help jump-start a quality movement at Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Deming Management Method |last=Walton |first=Mary |publisher=Penguin Group |year=1986 |pages=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deming told Ford that management actions were responsible for 85% of all problems in developing better cars. Based on Deming's advice, Ford management was charged with primary responsibility for automobile quality. Ford also adopted a quality culture employing [[statistical process control]] across all aspects of automobile design and manufacture. The Ford Taurus was the first Ford model resulting from this statistical approach to manufacture. In a letter to Autoweek, Donald Petersen, then Ford chairman, said, "We are moving toward building a quality culture at Ford and the many changes that have been taking place here have their roots directly in Deming's teachings."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sme.org/cgi-bin/get-press.pl?&amp;&amp;20012513&amp;ND&amp;&amp;SME&amp; Ford Embraces Six-Sigma Quality Goals.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312105954/http://www.sme.org/cgi-bin/get-press.pl?&amp;&amp;20012513&amp;ND&amp;&amp;SME&amp; |date=March 12, 2007 }} Accessed: 2006-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt; This new emphasis on quality in the manufacture of the Ford Taurus was reflected in Ford's advertising and marketing. The New York advertising firm Wells, Rich, Greene took on the Ford account in 1979 and Robert Cox was assigned to the Ford account and by the summer of 1981, “Quality is Job 1” became Ford’s calling card in marketing. This emphasis on quality was used heavily in marketing of the Ford Taurus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autonews.com/article/20160629/RETAIL03/160629819/robert-cox-ad-man-behind-fords-quality-is-job-1-pitch-dies&lt;/ref&gt;

The first-generation Taurus was launched in 1985 as a 1986 model to strong fanfare and sales, replacing the slow-selling mid-size Ford LTD. (The full-size [[Ford LTD Crown Victoria]] remained as part of the Ford line up.) The release of the Ford Taurus was one of the most anticipated ever, mostly because it was a first in car design and also the start of new quality standards for Ford. At the time of the Taurus's debut, Ford had been producing mainly rear-wheel drive cars, and [[Chrysler]] and [[General Motors]] were offering more front-wheel drive vehicles up to midrange including the [[Chrysler K platform]] and A-body [[Chevrolet Celebrity]]. With the introduction of the [[Ford Escort (North America)|Escort]] and [[Ford Tempo|Tempo]], Ford was making a transition to front-wheel drive. The Taurus displayed a rounder shape than its contemporaries, often likened to a '[[jelly bean]]' or 'flying potato',&lt;ref name = "jellybean"&gt;{{cite news | last = Schneiderman | first = R.M. | date = October 27, 2006 | publisher = Forbes | url = https://www.forbes.com/2006/10/27/ford-taurus-demise-cx_rs_1027autofacescan01.html | title = Ford Taurus, R.I.P.| accessdate = June 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the design of the [[Audi 100#C3, 1983–92|Audi 5000]] and Ford's European sedan, the [[Ford Sierra]], an updated appearance of a styling approach used in the late 1940s to early 1960s called "[[Ponton (automobile)|ponton]]" styling.&lt;ref name = "Taub"/&gt; Instead of a [[grille]], the Taurus mainstreamed the smooth grille-less '[[bottom breather]]' nose. The aerodynamic design of the Taurus made the car more fuel efficient, allowing Ford to meet more stringent [[corporate average fuel economy]] (CAFE) standard applied by the [[United States]] government.&lt;ref name = "Taub"/&gt; The Taurus's success ultimately led to an American [[automobile design]] revolution; Chrysler and General Motors developed aerodynamic cars in order to capitalize on the Taurus's success.&lt;ref name = "Taub"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Taurus: The Making of the Car That Saved Ford | first = Eric | last = Taub |date=November 1991 | isbn = 0-525-93372-7 | publisher = [[E. P. Dutton]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also benefitted from sharing a similar appearance to the limited production [[Ford Mustang SVO]] introduced two years earlier in 1984.

The first generation was available with either a V6 or an inline four-cylinder engine and came with either a [[manual transmission|manual]] (MT-5)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://articles.mcall.com/1986-10-04/news/2556816_1_test-car-cars-with-manual-transmissions-mid-size|title = Taurus Mt-5 - Room, Performance And Superior Value Road Test|last = KUCINSKI|first = LEONARD|date = October 4, 1986|work = The Morning Call|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ford-taurus.org/taurusinfo/Specials/MT5.php|title = Taurus MT5|date = January 11, 2007|accessdate = |website = Ford Encyclopedia|publisher = Taurus Car Club of America, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[automatic transmission]]. (The Taurus's twin, the [[Mercury Sable]], has never offered a manual transmission in either of its incarnations.) Like its exterior, the Taurus's interior was ahead of its time, and many features originating from it are still used in most cars today.&lt;ref name = "Taub"/&gt; Its interior was designed to be extremely user-friendly, with all of its controls designed to be recognizable by touch, allowing drivers to operate them without taking their eyes off the road.&lt;ref name = "Taub" /&gt; For example, the switches to the power windows and power locks were designed with one half of the switch raised up, with the other half recessed, in order for its function to be identified by touch.&lt;ref name = "Taub" /&gt; To further enhance this quality, the car's [[dashboard]] has all of the controls in the central area within reach of the driver. The left side of the dash curves slightly around the driver to make controls easily accessible, as well as creating a "cockpit" feel.

The interior of the Taurus was customizable to fit buyers' needs, with a large number of options and three different configurations. This means that the interior of the Taurus can be spartan or luxurious, depending on the buyer's choice of options. On models with an automatic transmission, the Taurus's interior was available in three different seating configurations.&lt;ref&gt;The interior could be ordered with a traditional column-mounted shifter and front bench seat, with bucket seats and a center console with a floor-mounted shifter, or with bucket seats and a console with a column-mounted shifter. (These options were also extended to the Sable and, beginning in 1988, the [[Lincoln Continental]] as well.) However, models available with a manual transmission were only available in one configuration: bucket seats with a center console and floor-mounted shifter.&lt;/ref&gt; The interior equipment depends on model. The most basic model, the L (see below), came standard, with just an AM radio and a front cloth bench seat, while the LX, the more luxurious model, came with a greater number of features as standard equipment.

The Taurus was well received by both the public and the press. It won many awards, most notably being named to the 1986 [[Car and Driver 10Best|Car and Driver Ten Best List]] and becoming the 1986 [[Motor Trend Car of the Year]]&lt;ref name = "COTY86"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hanson | first = John | title = Car of the Year 1986: It is Going To Be a Bull Market For The Ford Taurus | journal = [[Motor Trend]] | issue = February 1986 | pages = 23–36 | accessdate = August 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 200,000 of the Taurus were sold during the 1986 model year and the millionth Taurus was sold during the 1989 model year.&lt;ref name = "Taub" /&gt;  When production ended in 1991, more than 2,000,000 first-generation Tauruses had been sold.&lt;ref name = "TCCA numbers"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Taurus Car Club of America | url = http://www.ford-taurus.org/taurusinfo/Specs/Production.php | title = 1986–1997 Ford Taurus production numbers| accessdate = September 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ford Taurus received its first redesign in mid-1991 for the 1992 model year.  Still based on the same chassis, every exterior body panel (with the exception of the doors) was restyled.  In spite of the extensive changes, few modifications were made to the successful styling; in the marketplace, the redesign was largely released as a mid-cycle facelift.&lt;ref name = "bestselling" /&gt;  In terms of size, the 1992 Taurus gained several inches in length and over 200 pounds in curb weight.&lt;ref name="TCCA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-taurus.org/taurusinfo/G2/index.php|title=Taurus/Sable Spotter's Guide: Second Generation (1992–1995)|date=|publisher=Taurus Car Club of America|accessdate=April 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following market demand, the new Taurus was available solely with V6 engines and an automatic transmissions.  The Taurus SHO made its return, with an automatic transmission option joining the manual transmission.

The interior was also completely redesigned for 1992.  As part of the redesign, the Ford Taurus gained a passenger-side airbag as an option, which became standard in 1994, becoming the first mid-size sedan sold in the United States with standard dual airbags.&lt;ref name = "bestselling" /&gt;

The second generation sold just as well as the first, becoming the best-selling car in the [[United States]], a title it would retain for as long as this generation was sold.&lt;ref name = "bestselling" /&gt; When production ended in 1995, more than 1,400,000 second-generation cars had been sold.&lt;ref name = "TCCA numbers" /&gt;

==Third generation (1996–1999)==

For the 1996 model year, Ford debuted the third generation of the Ford Taurus.  Although not completely new, the chassis was heavily upgraded, becoming the DN101 generation.  Alongside the Mercury Sable, the Ford Taurus shared its underpinnings with the redesigned Lincoln Continental and all-new Ford Windstar.

In a break from the familiar styling of the previous two generations (that chief designer [[Jack Telnack]] had likened to a "pair of slippers"),&lt;ref name="News96"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sedgwick|first=David|title=Taurus for '96 will dare to stand out in competitive sedan market|journal=[[The Detroit News]]|issue=|pages=1C–2C|accessdate=April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford had sought to again make the Taurus stand out for buyers of mid-size sedans, giving the vehicle a much more extensive restyling than its 1992 predecessor.  Moving away from straight lines, the 1996 Taurus sought to include rounded lines, moving past the cab-forward design of the Chrysler LH sedans.  Alongside the Ford Blue Oval emblem itself, the Taurus repeated the shape several places in its exterior;&lt;ref name="bestselling" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite book|title=Car: A Drama of The American Workplace|last=Walton|first=Mary|date=May 1997|publisher=[[W. W. Norton]]|isbn=0-393-04080-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a controversial design element, the rear window of the Taurus was oval, as were the side windows of the Mercury Sable.  To allow better differentiation between models, the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable were given separate rooflines; Taurus/Sable station wagons were fitted with the doors of Sable sedans.

The interior saw a complete redesign.  To simplify production, all versions of the Taurus were fitted with bucket seats; six-passenger versions were fitted with a flip-forward center seat cushion also meant for use as a center console; five-passenger versions were fitted with a floor shifter and center console.&lt;ref name="Gen III"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-taurus.org/taurusinfo/G3/index.php|title=Taurus/Sable Spotter's Guide Generation 3|date=October 30, 2006|publisher=Taurus Car Club of America|work=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia|accessdate=February 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To improve ergonomics, radio and climate controls were centralized on an oval-shaped console on the dashboard.&lt;ref name="Tribune"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pierson|first=John|title=How Ford Added a Dash of Design To Its New Taurus|journal=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|issue=|pages=|accessdate=April 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaction to the third-generation Ford Taurus was mixed; Ford found that customers disliked  the oval-shaped exterior.  For 1996, the Ford Taurus stayed the best-selling car in the United States.  At the time, 51% of all Taurus sales for 1996 went to rental fleets, in contrast to the [[Honda Accord]] and [[Toyota Camry]], of which most sales were directly to private customers through [[Car dealership|retail outlets]].&lt;ref name="CG encyclopedia"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Encyclopedia of American Cars | first = The Editors of Consumer Guide | year = 2006 | month = | isbn = 1-4127-1354-4 | publisher = Publications International}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the Ford Taurus lost its best-selling status to the Toyota Camry.&lt;ref name="bestselling" /&gt;

For 1996, Ford Australia imported the Ford Taurus sedan as the "Taurus Ghia" alongside its locally produced [[Ford Falcon (EL)|Ford Falcon EL]], but imports ceased after only one year due to poor sales.&lt;ref name="Australia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.drive.com.au/drive/used-car-reviews/ford-taurus-19961998-20100824-13o9c.html|title=Ford Taurus 1996–1998|accessdate=October 7, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325180608/http://news.drive.com.au/drive/used-car-reviews/ford-taurus-19961998-20100824-13o9c.html|archivedate=March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Ford New Zealand imported both Ford Taurus sedans and station wagons from 1996 to 1998 with success alongside the RWD Australian Ford Falcon/Fairmont/Fairlane.

===NASCAR===

[[File:GregBiffleCar.jpg|thumb|Ford Taurus in NASCAR.]]
The third-generation Taurus had a presence in [[NASCAR]], replacing the [[Ford Thunderbird|Thunderbird]] for the 1998 season.  The Taurus became the first four-door sedan to be approved for competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-racing/nascar/season-recaps/1990s/1998-nascar.htm HowStuffWorks "1998 NASCAR Winston Cup Chronology"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The first Taurus driver to win the [[Winston Cup]] (the NASCAR sponsor of the time) [[List of NASCAR champions|championship]] was [[Dale Jarrett]], who drove #88 [[Ford Quality Care]]/[[Ford Credit]]-sponsored cars owned by [[Robert Yates (NASCAR owner)|Robert Yates]].  The first Taurus driver to win the Busch Series (now [[Xfinity Series]]) championship was [[Greg Biffle]], who drove #60 [[W. W. Grainger|Grainger Industrial Supply]]-sponsored cars owned by [[Jack Roush]].

In total, the Ford Taurus has won three Winston Cup championships and two Busch Series championships.

==Fourth generation (2000–2007)==

[[File:05-07 Ford Taurus SE sedan.jpg|thumb|right|2004-2007 Ford Taurus SE sedan]]
The Taurus received another redesign for 2000, which replaced many of the oval-derived design elements of the previous model with sharper creases and corners, an aspect of Ford's [[New Edge]] styling language. To reduce the car's price and keep it competitive, Ford reduced costs on the car in 1999, such as giving the Taurus sedan rear [[drum brake]]s on [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] equipped vehicles (previously, upgrading to ABS included the addition of rear disc brakes), eliminating the dual [[exhaust system|exhaust]] on the higher end models, and trimming many other small features.

Ford designed the fourth generation with much more conservative styling in hopes of increasing the car's appeal. Instead of sloping back, the car's trunk stood upright in a more traditional shape, increasing trunk space by another two cubic feet.&lt;ref name="Consumerguide00"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2000-to-2006-ford-taurus.htm |title=2000–2006 Ford Taurus overview |publisher=Consumer Guide |accessdate=February 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206022040/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2000-to-2006-ford-taurus.htm |archivedate=February 6, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "G4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ford-taurus.org/taurusinfo/G4/index.php |title=Taurus/Sable spotter's guide (Generation 4 2000–2007) |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |accessdate=April 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roof was also given a more upright stance to increase headroom, which can be evidenced by the thicker C-pillar and larger area between the tops of the doors and the top of the roof.

The interior was also completely redesigned with a more conventional shape, although some features from the previous Taurus generations were carried over. The dashboard was given a squarer design instead of curving around the driver as in the previous generation. The "integrated control panel" concept was carried over but redesigned, with a bigger, squarer shape, and it was placed in the center of the dash instead of being angled toward the driver. The flip-fold center console was also carried over from the previous generation, although it was revamped as well. When folded out, it now rested against the floor instead of the dashboard, and had reworked cup holders and storage areas.&lt;ref name = "G4" /&gt; In another change from previous versions, the fourth generation offered rear cup holders that either slid or folded out of the front console, depending on which console the car was equipped with.&lt;ref name = "G4" /&gt;

==Initial discontinuation and revival==
{{Wikinews|Ford Taurus to be revived}}
{{Main article|Ford Five Hundred}}

Taurus sales had slumped significantly in the years prior to its short-lived demise with model year 2007, losing significant market share to [[Japan]]ese sedans.&lt;ref name="det"/&gt; Due to waning popularity and customer demand, Ford decided to gradually discontinue the Taurus. The last Chicago, Illinois Ford Taurus Sedan rolled off the assembly line on June 25, 2004.  Production of the Taurus wagon was discontinued on December 8, 2004;&lt;ref name = "G4" /&gt; sedan retail sales halted after a short 2006 model year, and the Taurus became sold exclusively to [[fleet vehicles|fleets]] in the [[United States]], while still being sold to retail customers in [[Canada]]. Production ended on October 27, 2006, as Ford idled the Atlanta plant, as part of its ''[[The Way Forward]]'' [[Corporate restructuring|restructuring plan]].

Ford had decided to replace the Taurus with the full-size [[Ford Five Hundred|Five Hundred]] (a revival of the "500" nameplate suffix dating back to the 1950s), and midsize [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Fusion]] sedans and the Taurus wagon with the [[Ford Freestyle|Freestyle]] crossover SUV.
[[File:2004-2006 Ford Taurus Sedan.jpg|thumb|left|The last mid-size Taurus sedan was an SEL model like this one]]
Discontinuation of the Taurus was controversial.

Workers thought Ford had abandoned a car that had done so much to revitalize Ford and the US industry. An October 25, 2006, USA Today editorial, "How Ford starved its Taurus", noted that the Japanese stuck with their winners and make them better (such as the [[Toyota Corolla]], which has been in continuous production since the 1960s),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edmunds.com/toyota/corolla/history.html | title = Toyota Corolla history | publisher = Edmunds.com | accessdate = April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Detroit automakers retire cars and even entire division nameplates in search of "the next big thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = How Ford starved its Taurus | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-10-24-ford-taurus_x.htm | publisher = USA Today | date = October 25, 2006 | accessdate = October 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Auto Show 032.jpg|thumb|The 2008 Ford Five Hundred prototype, which was renamed "Taurus" upon Alan Mulally's direction]]
But [[Alan Mulally]], Ford's new CEO named in late 2006, wanted to revive the Taurus, saying in an interview with the [[Associated Press]] that he was baffled by the Taurus's discontinuation and believed it a mistake, adding that the Five Hundred should have been named "Taurus" from the beginning.&lt;ref name = "Alan"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17033668/ | title = CEO insisted in bringing "Taurus" back | publisher = [[MSNBC]] | date = February 7, 2007 | accessdate = July 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors of a possible Taurus revival were confirmed in early 2007, when the revamped Five Hundred and Freestyles were unveiled as "Taurus" and "Taurus X" at the 2007 [[Chicago Auto Show]], a decision influenced strongly by Mulally.&lt;ref name = "Alan" /&gt; Later, Mulally explained that the fact that the Taurus's name recognition and positive brand equity strongly influenced his decision to revive the nameplate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | title = Ford CEO Alan Mulally on the new Ford Taurus | publisher = Autoinsider news | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYlNOtqI8tc | date = July 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mercury division's twin also dropped the Sable name in favor of reviving the historic [[Mercury Montego|Montego]] nameplate, used in the 1960s and 1970s, but the Sable name returned in 2008.

==Fifth generation (2008–2009)==
{{Main article|Ford Taurus (fifth generation)}}
[[File:2008 Ford Taurus SEL .jpg|thumb|2008 Ford Taurus SEL]]

The fifth generation (5G) Taurus entered production in 2007 as a 2008 model and was developed directly from the [[Ford Five Hundred]], chiefly with a mild exterior [[Facelift (automobile)|facelift]] and revised engine and transmission. Ford designated the model as the Taurus, after the demise of the concurrently marketed fourth generation (4G) Taurus and to take advantage of its customer recognition and dealer demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Hundred To Be Renamed Taurus|url=http://www.stangbangers.com/News_FordFiveHundred.htm|publisher=stangbangers.com|accessdate=July 26, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217111308/http://www.stangbangers.com/News_FordFiveHundred.htm|archive-date=February 17, 2012|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes to the 5G Taurus from the Five Hundred included a new front end and the 263&amp;nbsp;hp 3.5&amp;nbsp;L [[Ford Cyclone engine|Duratec 35]] V6, which replaces the {{convert|203|hp|abbr=on}} [[Ford Mondeo V6 engine|Duratec 30]] 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[V6]]. The [[Ford Five Hundred|Five Hundred]]/Freestyle's [[List of Ford transmissions|ZF-Batavia]] [[continuously variable transmission|CVT]], which had a maximum torque rating of {{convert|221|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}, was also replaced with a [[GM-Ford 6-speed automatic transmission|Ford-GM joint venture six-speed automatic]] with additional torque of the Duratec 35. The [[Aisin]] AW six-speed automatic which was used on FWD Five Hundred and Montegos was also replaced by the new Ford six-speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ford slaps a once-successful nameplate on its refreshed and reinvigorated Five Hundred |author1=Siler, Steve |author2=Mike Dushane |publisher=Car and Driver |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/car/07q1/2008_ford_taurus-auto_shows |date=February 2007 |accessdate=February 25, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818000259/http://www.caranddriver.com/news/car/07q1/2008_ford_taurus-auto_shows |archivedate=August 18, 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SE sold for $24,125 according to Ford's website and served as the base model for the vehicle.

The 5G Taurus was sold in the Middle East as the Ford Five Hundred from 2008.&lt;ref name = "drivearabia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drivearabia.com/news/2008/02/10/so-we-got-a-ford-five-hundred/ |title=So we got a Ford Five Hundred |publisher=DriveArabia.com |accessdate=February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was determined that Ford's strategy to redesignate new cars in the lineup with new names beginning with the letter ''F'', as in [[Ford Focus (North America)|Ford Focus]], [[Ford Fusion (North America)|Ford Fusion]], and [[Ford Freestyle]], was not a good marketing move, as some of the renamed cars had highly recognizable iconic names. Car buyers in the U.S. did not associate the new ''F'' names with Ford, and were confused by the name changes.&lt;ref name = "DETROIT" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/ford-five-hundred-to-be-renamed-taurus.html |title=Five Hundred to be renamed "Taurus" |publisher=MSNBC.com |date=February 6, 2007 |accessdate=February 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mulally believed that the Taurus had an immediately strong [[brand equity]], and that it would take years for consumers to have a similar recognition of the Five Hundred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8N48NI80.htm |author=Krisher, Tom |title=Officials say Ford to revive Taurus name |publisher=BusinessWeek.com |date=February 6, 2007 |accessdate=February 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225221742/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8N48NI80.htm |archivedate=February 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable were awarded the Top Safety Pick ratings by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and five-star ratings by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The five-star rating given to the Taurus and the Sable is the highest safety rating being given by the government agency.

The 2010 Ford Taurus was revealed at the Detroit International Auto Show in 2009 at [[Cobo Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/5128405/2010-ford-taurus-a-flagship-returns |title=2010 Ford Taurus: A Flagship Returns – 2010 ford taurus |publisher=Jalopnik |date=January 11, 2009 |accessdate=December 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press preview of the Taurus and Taurus SHO was held in Asheville, North Carolina, from June 15 to 19, 2009.

The Ford scored well in test drives and the media was pleased with some of the new features available in the 2010 Ford Taurus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecarconnection.com/marty-blog/1021620_first-drive-2010-ford-taurus |title=2010 Ford Taurus First Drive |publisher=Thecarconnection.com |date=June 22, 2009 |accessdate=December 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these features included all wheel drive, cross traffic alert, collision warning, blind spot monitoring and adaptive cruise control. However, others criticized the lack of interior room and reduced sight lines despite its full-sized exterior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/27/automobiles/27ulrich-best.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;sq=Ford%20Taurus%20disappointing&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1 | work=The New York Times | title=A Holiday From Wishful Thinking | first=Lawrence | last=Ulrich | date=December 27, 2009 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Edmunds noted that the eighth-generation [[Honda Accord]] (which competes in the mid-size category) had superior driving dynamics and a more efficient design and offered almost as much interior space as the Taurus despite considerably smaller external dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideline.com/honda/accord/2009/comparison-test-2010-ford-taurus-vs-2009-honda-accord.html |title=2010 Ford Taurus vs. 2009 Honda Accord Comparison Test on Inside Line |publisher=Insideline.com |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=December 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The base price of the base SE model was $25,995, mid grade SEL $27,995, and top level Limited $31,995. Ford hoped to sell 10% to 15% high-performance SHO models.

The SHO (Super High Output), released in August 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecarconnection.com/marty-blog/1021595_driven-2010-ford-taurus-sho |title=First Drive Ford Taurus Sho |publisher=Thecarconnection.com |date=June 19, 2009 |accessdate=December 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Was powered by twin-turbocharged, gasoline direct injection EcoBoost 3.5L V6 engine. It had {{convert|365|hp}} and {{Convert|350|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque. Mileage was 17/25 mpg in AWD. The SHO base price was $37,995, which included the EcoBoost V6, all wheel drive, upgraded 6-speed automatic transmission and numerous exterior and interior trim upgrades. A fully loaded SHO could reach $45,395. There was also an available performance package which included upgraded brake pads, a 3.16:1 final drive ratio (compared to the standard 2.77:1), recalibrated electronic power steering, further suspension tuning, a re-calibrated AdvanceTrac system (Ford's combined [[traction control system]] and [[electronic stability control]]) with sport mode and "true off", summer compound Goodyear Eagle F1 245/45ZR20 tire, and an electric air pump with fix-a-flat in lieu of a spare tire.  Most options for the SHO remain available, with the Performance Package including options such as Power Moonroof, Heated/Cooled Seats, Multi-Contour Seats, Auto-Sensing Lights and Wipers, Automatic High-Beams, Adjustable Pedals, Blind Spot Information System (BLIS), and Satellite Navigation. Options from the Driver Assist option group, however, are unavailable simultaneously with the Performance Package. Those options include Adaptive Cruise Control, Collision Warning System, Lane Keep Assist, and Active Park Assist.

The base {{convert|365|hp}} produced by the SHO from the factory may be considered mild only a few years after its initial release, given the subsequent existence of {{convert|707|hp}} sedans like the [[Dodge Charger (LX)#Charger SRT Hellcat|Dodge Charger Hellcat]]. However, enthusiasts of the SHO have found the vehicle to be extremely compliant to power enhancing modifications; in many cases, with nothing more than a tune. The highest power 4th generation SHO (6th gen Taurus) currently stands at {{convert|617|hp}} at the wheels, as produced by Livernois Motorsports for one of their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stangtv.com/news/video-livernois-builds-worlds-highest-hp-EcoBoost-taurus-sho/ |title=Livernois Builds World’s Highest HP EcoBoost Taurus SHO |publisher=Power Automedia |date=August 21, 2014 |accessdate=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the potential for truly competitive levels of power on an AWD platform, the largely unassuming looks of the SHO compared to the base Taurus make the SHO a cost effective [[Sleeper (car)|sleeper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/news/a25497/this-is-what-a-550-hp-ford-taurus-sho-looks-like/ |title=This is what a 550-hp Taurus looks like |publisher=Road &amp; Track Magazine |date=April 10, 2015 |accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 facelift===
First revealed at the 2011 [[New York Auto Show]], the Taurus received a refresh for the 2013 model year. The body featured a new front fascia and slightly updated rear fascia with LED tail lamps, as well as all-new wheel options. The SHO model featured revised styling elements.  Refinements were made to the 3.5 EcoBoost V6. Power in the 3.5L V6, standard in non-SHO models, was up to 288&amp;nbsp;hp and got 19/29 MPG in FWD models, while getting 18/26MPG in AWD models. There was a new engine option for non-SHO models, a 2.0L EcoBoost Inline 4 developing 240&amp;nbsp;hp and 270&amp;nbsp;lb-ft of torque while delivering a best-in-class 22/32 miles per gallon. All models received upgrades to the steering and braking systems to improve driveability, including standard Torque Vectoring and curve control improving tracking at higher speeds. Updates to the Instrument dials were added, which were fully digital, clearer, and more colorful. [[MyFord Touch]] was added as part of Taurus's [[Ford Sync|Sync]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Steven J.

===Discontinuation (North America)===
On April 25, 2018, Ford announced plans to discontinue the Taurus (along with the Fiesta, Focus, and Fusion), in order to focus more on its line of trucks and SUVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/04/25/ford-kill-fusion-taurus-and-fiesta-cars/552148002/|title=Ford to kill Fusion, Taurus and Fiesta cars|work=USA TODAY|access-date=April 26, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement was part of a plan by Ford Motor Company to cut costs and increase profits. This was in response to a shift in perceived consumer demand towards SUVs and pickup trucks, and away from sedans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ford-motor-results/ford-posts-higher-quarterly-net-profit-beats-wall-street-estimates-idUSKBN1HW2UH|title=Ford accelerates cost-cutting plan, will drop most U.S. sedans|last=Carey|first=Nick|work=U.S.|access-date=April 26, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 5, 2018, Ford ended all national and promotional advertising (including sales and special offers) for its entire sedan lineup, including the Taurus, whose production will end in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autonews.com/article/20180905/RETAIL03/180909886/ford-stops-national-ads-for-sedans-including-fusion-still-in?X-IgnoreUserAgent=1 “Ford stops national ads for sedans, including Fusion still in production”] from Automotive News (September 5, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seventh generation (Chinese Market, 2016–present)==
{{Main article|Ford Taurus (seventh generation)}}
[[File:Ford Taurus 01 China 2016-04-12.jpg|thumb|Ford Taurus]]
[[File:Ford Taurus 03 China 2016-04-12.jpg|thumb|Ford Taurus]]
A seventh generation of the Ford Taurus was introduced at the [[Shanghai Auto Show#2015|2015 Shanghai Auto Show]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.leftlanenews.com/shanghai-live-2016-ford-taurus-88256.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Unrelated to the six generations of the American-market Ford Taurus, the seventh-generation was developed by [[Changan Ford Automobile Co., Ltd.|Changan Ford]] in conjunction with [[Ford Australia|Ford of Australia]].  Serving as the flagship of the Changan Ford joint venture, the Taurus is an extended-wheelbase variant of the [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]] ([[Ford Mondeo (fourth generation)|Mondeo]]), differing primarily in its 3.9-inch longer wheelbase and formal rear roofline.  The seventh-generation Taurus has been manufactured since November 2015 by Changan Ford in its [[Hangzhou]] facility. 

Derived from the Ford CD4 platform, the seventh-generation Taurus is fitted with a [[Ford EcoBoost engine#2.0 L (2010–)|2.0L EcoBoost]] inline-4 (an option for the sixth-generation Taurus) and a [[Ford EcoBoost engine#2.7 L Nano|2.7L EcoBoost]] V6 (used in the Fusion and Lincoln Continental), with a 6-speed automatic paired to both engines.

Since its 2015 introduction, the Changan Ford-produced Taurus has been produced solely for the [[Automotive industry in China|Chinese market]], with no considerations regarding future export.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5962">[[Image:frozen image method.png|thumb|right|Fig. 1. Illustration of the frozen mirror image method for a simplest case of the magnetic dipole over the flat superconducting surface.]]

'''Frozen mirror image method''' (or '''method of frozen images''') is an extension of the [[method of images]] for [[magnet]]-[[superconductor]] systems that has been introduced by [[Alexander Kordyuk]] in 1998 to take into account the magnetic [[flux pinning]] phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Kordyuk"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kordyuk | first1 = A. A.| doi = 10.1063/1.366648 | title = Magnetic levitation for hard superconductors| url = http://www.imp.kiev.ua/~kord/papers/box/Kordyuk%20JAP%201998.pdf| journal = [[Journal of Applied Physics]] | volume = 83 | issue = 1| pages = 610–611 | year = 1998 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1998JAP....83..610K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The method gives a simple representation of the [[magnetic field]] distribution generated by a magnet (a system of magnets) outside an infinitely flat surface of a [[Ideally hard superconductor|perfectly hard]] (with infinite [[pinning force]]) [[type-II superconductor]] in more general field cooled (FC) case, i.e. when the superconductor goes into superconducting state been already exposed to the magnetic field. The difference from the mirror image method, which deals with a perfect [[type-I superconductor]] (that completely expels the magnetic field, see the [[Meissner effect]]), is that the perfectly hard superconductor screens the variation of the external magnetic field rather than the field itself.

==Description==
The name originates from the replacement of certain elements in the original layout with imaginary magnets, which replicates the boundary conditions of the problem (see [[Dirichlet boundary conditions]]). In a simplest case of the [[magnetic dipole]] over the flat superconducting surface (see Fig. 1), the magnetic field, generated by a dipole moved from its initial position (at which the superconductor is cooled to the superconducting state) to a final position and by the screening currents at the superconducting surface, is equivalent to the field of three magnetic dipoles: the real one (1), its mirror image (3), and the mirror image of it in initial (FC) position but with the [[magnetization]] [[Vector (geometry)|vector]] inversed (2).

==Applications==
The method is shown to work for the bulk [[high temperature superconductors]] (HTSC),&lt;ref name="Kordyuk"/&gt; which are characterized by strong pinning and used for calculation of the interaction in magnet-HTSC systems such as superconducting [[magnetic bearings]],&lt;ref name="Hull"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hull | first1 = John R.| title = Superconducting bearings | doi = 10.1088/0953-2048/13/2/201 | journal = [[Superconductor Science and Technology]]| issn = 1361-6668| volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = R1-R15 | year = 2000 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2000SuScT..13R...1H | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1235722}}&lt;/ref&gt; superconducting [[Flywheel energy storage|flywheels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Filatov | first1 = A.

'''Hexanoic acid''', also known as '''caproic acid''', is the [[carboxylic acid]] derived from [[hexane]] with the chemical formula {{chem2|CH3(CH2)4COOH}}.  It is a colorless oily [[liquid]] with an odor that is fatty, cheesy, waxy, and like that of [[goat]]s&lt;ref name=Merck/&gt; or other barnyard [[animal]]s.  It is a [[fatty acid]] found naturally in various animal [[fat]]s and [[oil]]s, and is one of the chemicals that give the decomposing fleshy seed coat of the [[Ginkgo biloba|ginkgo]] its characteristic [[unpleasant odor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scidiv.bcc.ctc.edu/rkr/Ginkgo/Ginkgo.html Ginkgo.html&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of the components of [[vanilla]]. The primary use of hexanoic acid is in the manufacture of its [[ester]]s for artificial flavors, and in the manufacture of hexyl [[derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]], such as [[Alkylphenol|hexylphenols]].&lt;ref name=Merck/&gt; [[Salt (chemistry)|Salt]]s and [[ester]]s of hexanoic acid are known as '''hexanoates''' or '''caproates'''.

Two other acids are named after goats: [[caprylic acid|caprylic]] (C8) and [[decanoic acid|capric]] (C10). Along with hexanoic acid, these total 15% in goat milk fat.

Caproic, caprylic, and capric acids (capric is a crystal- or wax-like substance, whereas the other two are mobile liquids) are not only used for the formation of esters, but also commonly used "neat" in: butter, milk, cream, strawberry, bread, beer, nut, and other flavors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17744">In chemistry, a '''hydride''' is the [[anion]] of hydrogen, H&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;, or, more commonly, it is a [[Chemical compound|compound]] in which one or more hydrogen centres have [[nucleophilic]], reducing, or basic properties in it. In compounds that are regarded as hydrides, the hydrogen atom is bonded to a more [[electropositive]] element or groups. Compounds containing hydrogen bonded to metals or metalloid may also be referred to as hydrides. Common examples are [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[ethane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) (or any other [[hydrocarbon]]), and [[Nickel hydride]] (NiH), used in [[NiMH battery|NiMH rechargeable batteries]].

Almost all of the elements form [[Binary compounds of hydrogen|binary compounds with hydrogen]], the exceptions being [[helium|He]], [[neon|Ne]], [[argon|Ar]], [[krypton|Kr]], [[promethium|Pm]], [[osmium|Os]], [[iridium|Ir]], [[radon|Rn]], [[francium|Fr]], and [[radium|Ra]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood&gt;Greenwood, N. N.; &amp; Earnshaw, A. (1997). Chemistry of the Elements (2nd Edn.), Oxford:Butterworth-Heinemann. {{ISBN|0-7506-3365-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Inorganic Chemistry'' J.D. Lee&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Main Group Chemistry'', 2nd Edition A.G. Massey&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=redbook2005/&gt;

==Bonds==
Bonds between hydrogen and other elements  range from highly to somewhat covalent&lt;!-- most commentators would say somewhat covalent for the saline hydrides.--&gt;. Some hydrides, e.g. [[Boranes|boron hydrides]], do not conform to classical electron-counting rules, and the bonding is described in terms of multi-centered bonds, whereas the interstitial hydrides often involve [[metallic bond]]ing.  Hydrides can be discrete [[molecule]]s, [[oligomer]]s or [[polymer]]s, [[ionic solid]]s, [[chemisorption|chemisorbed]] monolayers,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;!--example would be nice as would a reference--&gt; bulk metals (interstitial), and other materials.  While hydrides traditionally react as [[Lewis base]]s or [[reducing agent]]s, some metal hydrides behave as hydrogen-atom donors and act as acids.

==Applications==
*Hydrides such as [[sodium borohydride]], [[lithium aluminium hydride]], [[diisobutylaluminium hydride]] (DIBAL) and [[super hydride]], are commonly used as [[reducing agent]]s in [[chemical synthesis]].  The hydride adds to an electrophilic center, typically unsaturated carbon.
*Hydrides such as [[sodium hydride]] and [[potassium hydride]] are used as strong [[Base (chemistry)|base]]s in [[organic synthesis]].  The hydride reacts with the weak Bronsted acid releasing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
*Hydrides such as [[calcium hydride]] are used as [[desiccant]]s, i.e. drying agents, to remove trace water from organic solvents.  The hydride reacts with water forming [[hydrogen]] and [[hydroxide]] salt.  The dry solvent can then be distilled or vac transferred from the "solvent pot".
*Hydrides are important in storage battery technologies such as [[nickel-metal hydride battery]].  Various metal hydrides have been examined for use as a means of hydrogen storage for [[fuel cell]]-powered electric cars and other purposed aspects of a [[hydrogen economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

* Hydride complexes are catalysts and catalytic intermediates in  a variety of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic cycles.  Important examples include [[hydrogenation]], [[hydroformylation]], [[hydrosilylation]], [[hydrodesulfurization]] catalysts.  Even certain enzymes, the [[hydrogenase]], operate via hydride intermediates.  The energy carrier [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] reacts as a hydride donor or hydride equivalent.

== Hydride ion ==
{{See also|Hydrogen anion}}
Free hydride anions exist only under extreme conditions and are not invoked for homogeneous solution.  Instead, many compounds have hydrogen centres with hydridic character.

Aside from [[electride]], the hydride ion is the simplest possible [[anion]], consisting of two [[electron]]s and a [[proton]]. Hydrogen has a relatively low [[electron affinity]], 72.77&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol and reacts exothermically with protons as a powerful [[Lewis base]]. 
::H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  →  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; [[Enthalpy|Δ''H'']] = −1676&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol
The low electron affinity of hydrogen and the strength of the H&amp;ndash;H bond (∆H&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; = 436&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol) means that the hydride ion would also be a strong [[reducing agent]]
::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  ⇌  2H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;; [[Standard electrode potential|''E''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;o&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] = −2.25 V

== Types of hydrides ==

According to the general definition every element of the [[periodic table]] (except some [[noble gas]]es) forms one or more hydrides. These substances have been classified into three main types according to the nature of their [[Chemical bond|bonding]]:&lt;ref name=Greenwood/&gt;
*''Ionic hydrides'', which have significant [[ionic bonding]] character.
*''Covalent hydrides'', which include the hydrocarbons and many other compounds which [[Covalent bond|covalently bond]] to hydrogen atoms.
*''Interstitial hydrides'', which may be described as having [[metallic bonding]].
While these divisions have not been used universally, they are still useful to understand differences in hydrides.

=== Ionic hydrides ===
Ionic or saline hydrides are composed of hydride bound to an electropositive metal, generally an [[alkali metal]] or [[alkaline earth metal]].  The divalent [[lanthanide]]s such as [[europium]] and [[ytterbium]] form compounds similar to those of heavier alkali metal. In these materials the hydride is viewed as a [[pseudohalide]]. Saline hydrides are insoluble in conventional solvents, reflecting their non-molecular structures. Ionic hydrides are used as bases and, occasionally, as reducing [[reagent]]s in [[organic synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=H. C.|title=Organic Syntheses via Boranes|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|date=1975|ISBN=0-471-11280-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Acetophenone|C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;C(O)CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[Potassium hydride|KH]] &amp;rarr; C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;C(O)CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;K + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Typical solvents for such reactions are [[ethers]]. [[Water]] and other [[protic solvent]]s cannot serve as a medium for ionic hydrides because the hydride ion is a stronger [[Base (chemistry)|base]] than [[hydroxide]] and most [[hydroxyl]] anions. Hydrogen gas is liberated in a typical acid-base reaction.

:NaH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[Oxygen|O]] → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + NaOH{{pad|3em}} Δ''H'' = −83.6&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, [[Gibbs free energy|Δ''G'']] = −109.0&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol

Often alkali metal hydrides react with metal halides. [[Lithium aluminium hydride]] (often abbreviated as LAH) arises from reactions of [[lithium hydride]] with [[aluminium chloride]].
:4 [[Lithium hydride|LiH]] + AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 LiCl

===Covalent hydrides===
According to some definitions, covalent hydrides cover all other compounds containing hydrogen.  Some definitions limit hydrides to hydrogen centres that formally react as hydrides, i.e. are nucleophilic, and hydrogen atoms bound to metal centers.These hydrides are formed by all the true non-metals (except zero group elements) and the elements like Al, Ga, Sn, Pb, Bi, Po, etc., which are normally metallic in nature, i.e., this class includes the hydrides of p-block elements. In these substances the hydride bond is formally a [[covalent bond]] much like the bond made by a proton in a [[weak acid]].  This category includes hydrides that exist as discrete molecules, polymers or oligomers, and hydrogen that has been chem-adsorbed to a surface.  A particularly important segment of covalent hydrides are [[complex metal hydride]]s, powerful soluble hydrides commonly used in synthetic procedures.

Molecular hydrides often involve additional ligands such as, [[diisobutylaluminium hydride]] (DIBAL) consists of two aluminum centers bridged by hydride ligands. Hydrides that are soluble in common solvents are widely used in organic synthesis. Particularly common are [[sodium borohydride]] (NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[lithium aluminium hydride]] and hindered reagents such as DIBAL.

===Interstitial hydrides or metallic hydrides===

Interstitial hydrides most commonly exist within metals or alloys. They are traditionally termed 'compounds', even though they do not strictly conform to the definition of a compound; more closely resembling common alloys such as steel. In such hydrides, hydrogen can exist as either atomic, or diatomic entities. Mechanical or thermal processing, such as bending, striking, or annealing may cause the hydrogen to precipitate out of solution, by degassing. Their bonding is generally considered [[metallic bonding|metallic]]. Such bulk transition metals form interstitial binary hydrides when exposed to hydrogen. These systems are usually [[Non-stoichiometric compound|non-stoichiometric]], with variable amounts of hydrogen atoms in the lattice. In materials engineering, the phenomenon of [[hydrogen embrittlement]] results from the formation of interstitial hydrides. Hydrides of this type form according to either one of two main mechanisms. The first mechanism involves the adsorption of dihydrogen, succeeded by the cleaving of the H-H bond, the delocalisation of the hydrogen's electrons, and finally, the diffusion of the protons into the metal lattice. The other main mechanism involves the electrolytic reduction of ionised hydrogen on the surface of the metal lattice, also followed by the diffusion of the protons into the lattice. The second mechanism is responsible for the observed temporary volume expansion of certain electrodes used in electrolytic experiments.

[[Palladium]] absorbs up to 900 times its own volume of hydrogen at room temperatures, forming [[palladium hydride]].  This material has been discussed as a means to carry hydrogen for vehicular [[fuel cell]]s.  Interstitial hydrides show certain promise as a way for safe [[hydrogen storage]]. During last 25 years many interstitial hydrides were developed that readily absorb and discharge hydrogen at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. They are usually based on [[intermetallic]] compounds and solid-solution alloys. However, their application is still limited, as they are capable of storing only about 2 weight percent of hydrogen, insufficient for automotive applications.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

===Transition metal hydride complexes===
{{Main article|Transition metal hydride}}
Transition metal hydrides include compounds that can be classified as ''covalent hydrides''. Some are even classified as interstitial hydrides{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} and other bridging hydrides. Classical&lt;!--this is an odd term- classic hydrides has been used elsewhere in wikipedia with a different meaning --&gt; transition metal hydride feature a single bond between the hydrogen centre and the transition metal.  Some transition metal hydrides are acidic, e.g., HCo(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The anions [[Potassium nonahydridorhenate|[ReH&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [FeH&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; are examples from the growing collection&lt;!--an example of an old refence bing used to support the changed statemnt it originally saqid rare --&gt; of known molecular [[homoleptic]] metal hydrides.&lt;ref&gt;A. Dedieu (Editor) Transition Metal Hydrides 1991, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{ISBN|0-471-18768-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[pseudohalide]]s, hydride ligands are capable of bonding with positively polarized hydrogen centres. &lt;!-- obscure, over technical language  --&gt; This interaction, called [[dihydrogen bond]] is similar to [[hydrogen bonding]] which exists between positively polarized protons and electronegative atoms with open lone pairs.

===Deuterides===
Hydrides containing [[deuterium]] are known as ''deuterides''.  Some deuterides, such as [[lithium deuteride|LiD]], are important fusion fuels in [[thermonuclear weapon]]s, and useful moderators in [[nuclear reactor]]s.

==Appendix on nomenclature==
''Protide'', ''deuteride'', and ''tritide'' are used to describe ions or compounds, which contain [[isotopic enrichment|enriched]] [[hydrogen-1]], [[deuterium]] or [[tritium]], respectively.

In the classic meaning, hydride refers to any [[Chemical compound|compounds]] hydrogen forms with other elements, ranging over [[Periodic table group|groups]] 1–16 (the [[binary compounds of hydrogen]]).  The following is a list of the nomenclature for the hydride derivatives of main group compounds according to this definition:&lt;ref name=redbook2005&gt;{{cite book |url=http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/rbook/Red_Book_2005.pdf |title=Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry (“The Red Book”)|series=IUPAC Recommendations |year=2005 |ID=Par. IR-6 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[alkali metal|alkali]] and [[alkaline earth metal|alkaline earth]] metals: metal hydride
*[[boron]]: [[borane]], BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
*[[aluminium]]: [[aluminium hydride|alumane]], AlH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
*[[gallium]]: [[gallane]], GaH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
*[[indium]]: [[indigane]], InH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
*[[thallium]]: [[thallane]], TlH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
*[[carbon]]: [[alkane]]s, [[alkene]]s, [[alkyne]]s, and all [[hydrocarbon]]s
*[[silicon]]: [[silane]]
*[[germanium]]: [[germane]]
*[[tin]]: [[stannane]]
*[[lead]]: [[plumbane]]
*[[nitrogen]]: [[ammonia]] ('azane' when [[substituent|substituted]]), [[hydrazine]]
*[[phosphorus]]: [[phosphine]] (note 'phosphane' is the [[IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry 2005|IUPAC]] recommended name)
*[[arsenic]]: [[arsine]] (note 'arsane' is the [[IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry 2005|IUPAC]] recommended name)
*[[antimony]]: [[stibine]] (note 'stibane' is the [[IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry 2005|IUPAC]] recommended name)
*[[bismuth]]: [[bismuthine]] (note 'bismuthane' is the [[IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry 2005|IUPAC]] recommended name)
*[[helium]]: [[Helium hydride ion|helium hydride]] (only exists as an ion)

According to the convention above, the following are "hydrogen compounds" and not "hydrides":{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
*[[oxygen]]: [[Properties of water|water]] ('oxidane' when substituted; synonym: oxygen hydride), [[hydrogen peroxide]]
*[[sulfur]]: [[hydrogen sulfide]] ('sulfane' when substituted) synonym: sulfur hydride
*[[selenium]]: [[hydrogen selenide]] ('selane' when substituted)
*[[tellurium]]: [[hydrogen telluride]] ('tellane' when substituted)
*[[polonium]]: [[hydrogen polonide]] ('polane' when substituted)
*[[halogen]]s: hydrogen halides

Examples:
*[[nickel hydride]]: used in [[NiMH battery|NiMH batteries]]
*[[palladium hydride]]: electrodes in [[cold fusion]] experiments
*[[lithium aluminium hydride]]: a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry
*[[sodium borohydride]]: selective specialty reducing agent, hydrogen storage in [[direct borohydride fuel cell|fuel cells]]
*[[sodium hydride]]: a powerful base used in organic chemistry
*[[diborane]]: reducing agent, rocket fuel, semiconductor dopant, catalyst, used in organic synthesis; also [[borane]], [[pentaborane]] and [[decaborane]]
*[[arsine]]: used for [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] [[semiconductors]]
*[[stibine]]: used in [[semiconductor]] industry
*[[phosphine]]: used for [[fumigation]]
*[[silane]]: many industrial uses, e.g. manufacture of [[composite material]]s and water repellents
*[[ammonia]]: [[coolant]], [[fuel]], [[fertilizer]], many other industrial uses
*[[hydrogen sulfide]]: component of [[natural gas]], important source of [[sulfur]]
*Chemically, even [[water]] and [[hydrocarbon]]s could be considered hydrides.

All metalloid hydrides are highly flammable. All solid non-metallic hydrides except [[ice]] are highly flammable. But, when hydrogen combines with halogens, it produces acids rather than hydrides, and they are not flammable.

===Precedence convention===
According to [[IUPAC inorganic nomenclature|IUPAC convention]], by precedence (stylized electronegativity), hydrogen falls between [[nitrogen group|group 15]] and [[chalcogen|group 16]] elements. Therefore, we have NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 'nitrogen hydride' ([[ammonia]]), versus H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, 'hydrogen oxide' ([[water]]). This convention is sometimes broken for polonium, which on the grounds of polonium's metallicity is often referred to as 'polonium hydride' instead of the expected 'hydrogen polonide'.

The '''International Solar Energy Society''' ('''ISES''') is a global organization for promoting the development and utilisation of [[renewable energy]]. ISES is a [[United Nations|UN]]-accredited [[NGO]] headquartered in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]], [[Germany]]. Dr David S. Renné is the current president. 

ISES was formed in 1954 as a worldwide non-profit organisation dedicated to the advancement of the utilisation of [[solar energy]].  ISES is now active in over 110 countries worldwide.  Its members include scientists and researchers, plus many others from industry, solar energy associations and other private and public organisations.

ISES also organizes ''Young ISES'', a network of students and young professional ISES members connecting young solar professionals worldwide''.''

== Aims ==
ISES aims to help its global members provide the technical answers needed to accelerate the transformation to 100% renewable energy. This is reflected in the society's official vision statement:&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''The International Solar Energy Society (ISES) envisions a world with 100% renewable energy for everyone used wisely and efficiently.''''' &lt;/blockquote&gt;ISES aims to bring recent developments in solar energy, both in research and applications, to the attention of decision makers and the general public, in order to increase the understanding and use of this non-polluting resource in everyday life. 

Through its events and publications, ISES promotes research, development, and use of technologies which are directly or indirectly fuelled by the sun. These technologies can provide sustainable solutions for the supply of energy in both industrialised and developing countries. 
In spite of a historic focus on direct solar energy, ISES today is involved in all renewable energy fields.

== Partnerships ==
ISES is a member of the [[International Renewable Energy Alliance]] (REN Alliance).  Other members include the [[International Geothermal Association]] (IGA), [[International Hydropower Association]] (IHA), [[World Bioenergy Association]] (WBA) and the [[World Wind Energy Association]] (WWEA).

== Publications ==
ISES is the publisher of several publications including ''[[Renewable Energy Focus]]'', the scientific journal ''[[Solar Energy (journal)|Solar Energy]]'' and various white papers. ISES also operates an online bookshop which includes conference proceedings, pocket reference books and others.

== National sections==

The ISES Sections are organisations working at the national or regional level and represent the international organisation at this level.  Members are encouraged to be involved with the Sections in their area.

'''Jillian Louise Calland Duff''' (called '''Jill''';&lt;ref name="Next" /&gt;&lt;ref name="joins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="announced" /&gt; born 1972) is a British [[Anglican]] bishop.

The '''lemon''', ''Citrus limon'' (L.) Osbeck, is a species of small [[evergreen]] tree in the [[flowering plant]] family [[Rutaceae]], native to [[South Asia]], primarily [[Northeast India|North eastern India]].

The tree's [[ellipsoid]]al yellow [[hesperidium|fruit]] is used for culinary and non-culinary purposes throughout the world, primarily for its [[juice]], which has both culinary and cleaning uses.&lt;ref name=morton/&gt; The pulp and [[peel (fruit)|rind]] ([[zest (ingredient)|zest]]) are also used in cooking and baking. The juice of the lemon is about 5% to 6% [[citric acid]], with a [[pH]] of around 2.2, giving it a sour taste. The distinctive sour taste of lemon juice makes it a key ingredient in [[drink]]s and foods such as [[lemonade]] and [[lemon meringue pie]].

==History==
{{see also|Citron#Origin and distribution}}

[[File:Lemon-Whole-Split.jpg|thumb|Lemon external surface and cross-section]]
The origin of the lemon is unknown, though lemons are thought to have first grown in [[Assam]] (a region in [[northeast India]]), northern [[Burma]] or [[China]].&lt;ref name="morton"&gt;{{cite web|year=1987|pages=160–168|title=Lemon in Fruits of Warm Climates|author=Julia F. Morton|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/lemon.html#Description|publisher=Purdue University}}&lt;/ref&gt; A genomic study of the lemon indicated it was a hybrid between [[bitter orange]] (sour orange) and [[citron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gulsen, O.|author2=M. L. Roose|year=2001|title=Lemons: Diversity and Relationships with Selected ''Citrus'' Genotypes as Measured with Nuclear Genome Markers|journal=Journal of the American Society of Horticultural Science|volume=126|pages=309–317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/01/110118101600.htm Genetic origin of cultivated citrus determined: Researchers find evidence of origins of orange, lime, lemon, grapefruit, other citrus species"], ''Science Daily,'' January 26, 2011 (Retrieved February 10, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lemons entered [[Europe]] near southern [[Italy]] no later than the second century AD, during the time of [[Ancient Rome]].&lt;ref name=morton/&gt; However, they were not widely cultivated. They were later introduced to [[Persia]] and then to [[Iraq]] and [[Egypt]] around 700 AD.&lt;ref name=morton/&gt; The lemon was first recorded in literature in a 10th-century [[Arabic]] treatise on farming, and was also used as an ornamental plant in early [[Islamic garden]]s.&lt;ref name=morton/&gt; It was distributed widely throughout the Arab world and the [[Mediterranean region]] between 1000 and 1150.&lt;ref name=morton/&gt;

The first substantial cultivation of lemons in Europe began in [[Genoa]] in the middle of the 15th century. The lemon was later introduced to the [[Americas]] in 1493 when [[Christopher Columbus]] brought lemon seeds to [[Hispaniola]] on his voyages. Spanish conquest throughout the New World helped spread lemon seeds. It was mainly used as an ornamental plant and for medicine.&lt;ref name=morton/&gt; In the 19th century, lemons were increasingly planted in [[Florida]] and [[California]].&lt;ref name=morton/&gt;

In 1747, [[James Lind (physician)|James Lind]]'s experiments on seamen suffering from [[scurvy]] involved adding lemon juice to their diets, though [[vitamin C]] was not yet known.&lt;ref name=morton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Lind|title=A treatise on the scurvy. Second edition.|place=London|publisher=A. Millar|year=1757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the word "lemon" may be Middle Eastern.&lt;ref name=morton/&gt; The word draws from the Old French ''limon'', then Italian ''limone'', from the Arabic ''laymūn'' or ''līmūn'', and from the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''līmūn'', a generic term for [[citrus]] fruit, which is a cognate of Sanskrit (''nimbū'', “[[Lime (fruit)|lime]]”).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lemon|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutritional value and phytochemicals==
Lemons are a rich source of [[vitamin C]], providing 64% of the [[Daily Value]] in a 100 g serving (table). Other [[essential nutrients]], however, have insignificant content (table).

Lemons contain numerous [[phytochemicals]], including [[polyphenols]], [[terpenes]], and [[tannins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Org Med Chem Lett|year=2014|volume=4|page=5|doi=10.1186/2191-2858-4-5|title=Phytochemical analysis and radical scavenging profile of juices of Citrus sinensis, Citrus anrantifolia, and Citrus limonum|authors=Rauf A, Uddin G, Ali J|pmid=25024932|pmc=4091952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lemon juice contains slightly more [[citric acid]] than [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] juice (about 47&amp;nbsp;g/l), nearly twice the citric acid of [[grapefruit]] juice, and about five times the amount of citric acid found in [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] juice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Penniston KL, Nakada SY, Holmes RP, Assimos DG | title=Quantitative Assessment of Citric Acid in Lemon Juice, Lime Juice, and Commercially-Available Fruit Juice Products | journal=Journal of Endourology | volume=22 | issue=3 | year=2008 |url=http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/end.2007.0304 | format = PDF | pmid=18290732 | pages = 567–570 | doi = 10.1089/end.2007.0304 | pmc=2637791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culinary uses==
Lemon juice, rind, and peel are used in a wide variety of foods and drinks. The whole lemon is used to make [[marmalade]], [[lemon curd]] and [[lemon liqueur]]. Lemon slices and lemon rind are used as a [[garnish (food)|garnish]] for food and drinks. Lemon [[zest (ingredient)|zest]], the grated outer rind of the fruit, is used to add flavor to baked goods, puddings, rice, and other dishes.

===Juice===
[[Lemon juice]] is used to make [[lemonade]], [[soft drink]]s, and [[cocktail]]s. It is used in [[marinade]]s for fish, where its acid neutralizes [[amine]]s in fish by converting them into nonvolatile [[ammonium]] salts, and meat, where the acid partially [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzes]] tough collagen fibers, [[tenderizing]] the meat, but the low [[pH]] denatures the proteins, causing them to dry out when cooked. Lemon juice is frequently used in the [[United Kingdom]] to add to [[pancakes]], especially on [[Shrove Tuesday]].

Lemon juice is also used as a short-term [[preservative]] on certain foods that tend to oxidize and turn brown after being sliced ([[enzymatic browning]]), such as [[apple]]s, [[banana]]s, and [[avocado]]s, where its acid denatures the enzymes.

===Peel===

In [[Morocco]], lemons are preserved in jars or barrels of salt. The salt penetrates the peel and rind, softening them, and curing them so that they last almost indefinitely. The preserved lemon is used in a wide variety of dishes. Preserved lemons can also be found in Sicilian, Italian, Greek, and French dishes.

===Leaves===

The leaves of the lemon tree are used to make a tea and for preparing cooked meats and seafoods.

==Other uses==
===Industrial===
Lemons were the primary commercial source of [[citric acid]] before the development of [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]]-based processes.&lt;ref name="Hofrichter2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Hofrichter|title=Industrial Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=80XBNrGsIywC&amp;pg=PA224|year=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-11458-8|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a cleaning agent===
{{references|section|date=August 2018}}
The juice of the lemon may be used for cleaning. A halved lemon dipped in salt or baking powder is used to brighten copper cookware. The acid dissolves the tarnish and the abrasives assist the cleaning. As a sanitary kitchen [[deodorizer]] the juice can deodorize, remove grease, bleach stains, and disinfect; when mixed with [[Sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]], it removes stains from plastic food storage containers. The oil of the lemon's peel also has various uses. It is used as a wood cleaner and polish, where its solvent property is employed to dissolve old wax, fingerprints, and grime. Lemon oil and [[orange oil]] are also used as a nontoxic [[insecticide]] treatment.

===Aroma===
Lemon oil may be used in [[aromatherapy]]. Lemon oil aroma does not influence the human [[immune system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18178322|pmc=2278291|year=2008|author1=Kiecolt-Glaser|first1=J.

===Other===
One educational science experiment involves attaching [[electrode]]s to a lemon and using it as a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] to produce electricity. Although very low power, several [[lemon battery|lemon batteries]] can power a small digital watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energyquest.ca.gov/projects/lemon.html|title=Lemon Power |publisher=California Energy Commission|accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These experiments also work with other fruits and vegetables.

Lemon juice may be used as a simple [[invisible ink]], developed by heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/invisible-ink-and-other-science-of-10-04-20/|title=Invisible Ink and More: The Science of Spying in the Revolutionary War|last=Mirsky|first=Steve|date=April 20, 2010|website=Scientific American|publisher=|access-date=October 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Horticulture==
Lemons need a minimum temperature of around {{convert|7|C|F}}, so they are not hardy year round in temperate climates, but become hardier as they mature.&lt;ref name="rhs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/grow-your-own/fruit/citrus|title=Citrus|publisher=Royal Horticultural Society|date=2017|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citrus require minimal pruning by trimming overcrowded branches, with the tallest branch cut back to encourage bushy growth.&lt;ref name=rhs/&gt; Throughout summer, pinching back tips of the most vigorous growth assures more abundant canopy development. As mature plants may produce unwanted, fast-growing shoots called ‘water shoots’, these are removed from the main branches at the bottom or middle of the plant.&lt;ref name=rhs/&gt;

In 2016, world production of lemons (combined with [[Lime (fruit)|limes]] for reporting) was 17.3 million [[tonne]]s.&lt;ref name=faostat16/&gt; The top producers were India, Mexico, China, Argentina, and Brazil, collectively accounting for 62% of total production (table).&lt;ref name="faostat16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Statistics Division (FAOSTAT)|title=World production of lemons and limes in 2016; Crops/Regions/World/Production Quantity from pick lists|date=2017|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lemon alternatives==
Many plants taste or smell similar to lemons.
* [[Lime (fruit)|Limes]], another common sour citrus fruit, used similarly to lemons
** [[Kaffir lime]] leaves: popular in east Asian cuisine
* Certain cultivars of [[basil]]
* ''[[Cymbopogon]]'' (lemongrass)
* [[Lemon balm]], a mint-like herbaceous perennial in the [[Lamiaceae]] family
* Two varieties of [[Pelargonium#Scented 'geraniums'|scented geranium]]: ''Pelargonium crispum'' (lemon geranium) and ''Pelargonium x melissinum'' (lemon balm)
* [[Lemon thyme]]
* [[Lemon verbena]]
* Certain cultivars of [[mentha|mint]]
* ''[[Magnolia grandiflora]]'' tree flowers

==Other citrus called 'lemons'==
* [[Citrus depressa|Flat lemon]], a mandarin hybrid
* [[Meyer lemon]], a cross between a citron and a mandarin/pomelo hybrid distinct from sour or sweet orange,&lt;ref name="limes and lemons"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Phylogenetic origin of limes and lemons revealed by cytoplasmic and nuclear markers | last1=Curk | first1=Franck | last2=Ollitrault | first2= Frédérique | last3=Garcia-Lor | first3= Andres | last4=Luro | first4=François | last5=Navarro | first5=Luis | last6=Ollitrault | first6=Patrick | journal=Annals of Botany | volume=11 | pages=565–583 | year=2016 | doi=10.1093/aob/mcw005 | pmc=4817432 }}&lt;/ref&gt; named after Frank N. Meyer, who first introduced it to the United States in 1908. Thin-skinned and slightly less acidic than the Lisbon and Eureka lemons, Meyer lemons require more care when shipping and are not widely grown on a commercial basis. Meyer lemons often mature to a yellow-orange color. They are slightly more frost-tolerant.
* [[Ponderosa lemon]], more cold-sensitive than true lemons, the fruit are thick-skinned and very large. Genetic analysis showed it to be a complex hybrid of citron and pomelo.&lt;ref name="limes and lemons" /&gt;
* [[Rough lemon]], a citron-mandarin cross, cold-hardy and often used as a [[citrus rootstock]]&lt;ref name="limes and lemons" /&gt;
* [[Sweet lemon]]s or sweet limes, a mixed group including the [[lumia (citrus)|lumia]] (pear lemon), [[Citrus limetta|limetta]], and [[Palestinian sweet lime]]. Among them is the Jaffa lemon, a pomelo-citron hybrid.&lt;ref name="limes and lemons" /&gt;
* Volkamer lemon, like the rough lemon, a citron-mandarin cross&lt;ref name="limes and lemons" /&gt;

'''Louis-Antoine, Comte de Bougainville''' (12 November 1729 – 31 August 1811) was a French [[admiral]] and [[exploration|explorer]]. A contemporary of the British explorer [[James Cook]], he took part in the [[Seven Years' War]] in North America and the [[American Revolutionary War]] against Britain. Bougainville later gained fame for his expeditions, including circumnavigation of the globe in a scientific expedition in 1763, the first recorded settlement on the [[Falkland Islands]], and voyages into the Pacific Ocean. [[Bougainville Island]] of [[Papua New Guinea]] as well as the [[Bougainvillea]] flower were named after him.

== Early career ==
Bougainville was born in Paris, the son of a notary, on either 11 or 12 November 1729. In early life, he studied law, but soon abandoned the profession. In 1753 he entered the army in the corps of [[musketeer]]s. At the age of twenty-five he published a treatise on [[integral calculus]], as a supplement to [[Guillaume François Antoine, Marquis de l'Hôpital|De l'Hôpital]]'s treatise, ''Des infiniment petits''.

In 1755 he was sent to London as secretary to the French embassy, where he was made a member of the [[Royal Society]].

{{further|France in the Seven Years' War}}
In 1756 Bougainville was stationed in Canada as captain of dragoons and [[aide-de-camp]] to the [[Marquis de Montcalm]]. He took an active part in the [[Battle of Fort Oswego (1756)|capture of Fort Oswego]] in 1756 and the 1757 [[Battle of Fort William Henry]]. He was wounded in 1758 at the [[Battle of Carillon (1758)|successful defence]] of [[Fort Carillon]]. He sailed back to France the following winter, under orders from the marquis to obtain additional military resources for the colony. During this crossing, he continued to learn about the ways of the sea, skills that would later serve him well. Having distinguished himself in the war against Britain, Bougainville was rewarded with the [[Cross of St Louis]] and promoted to colonel. When he returned to Canada the following year, he had gained few supplies. The metropolitan officials had decided that, "When the house is on fire, one does not worry about the stables".{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

During the pivotal year of 1759 (see [[Seven Years' War]] and [[French and Indian War]]), Bougainville participated in the defence of fortified [[Quebec City]], the capital of [[New France]]. With a small elite troop under his command, among which were the ''Grenadiers'' and the ''Volontaires à cheval'', he patrolled the north shore of the [[St. Lawrence River]], upstream from the city; he prevented the British several times from landing and cutting communications with Montreal. He did not have sufficient time, however, to rally his troops and attack the British rear when they successfully ascended the [[Plains of Abraham]] and attacked Quebec on 13 September.

Following the death of the Marquis de Montcalm and the fall of Québec on 18 September – after the colonel's aborted attempt to resupply the besieged city – Bougainville was dispatched to the western front by his new commanding officer, the [[Chevalier de Lévis]]. He attempted to stop the British advance from his entrenchments at [[Île-aux-Noix, Quebec|Île-aux-Noix]]. He was among the officers who accompanied Lévis to [[Saint Helen's Island]] off Montreal for the last French stand in North America before the general capitulation of 1761. Of the war, Bougainville wrote in his journal: "It is an abominable kind of war. The very air we breathe is contagious of insensibility and hardness".&lt;ref&gt;Cave, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Shipped back to Europe along with the other French officers, all deprived of military honours by the victors, Bougainville was prohibited by the terms of surrender from any further active duty against the British. He spent the remaining years of the Seven Years' War (1761 to 1763) as a diplomat, helping to negotiate the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]]. Under this France ceded most of New France east of the Mississippi River to the [[British Empire]].

==The first French circumnavigation==
=== Îles Malouines settlement ===

After the peace, the French decided to colonise the "Isles Malouines" ([[Falkland Islands]]). These islands were at that time almost unknown. At his own expense, Bougainville undertook the task of resettling [[Acadians]] who had been deported to France by the British because of their refusal to sign loyalty oaths.

On 15 September 1763, Bougainville set out from France with the frigate ''L'Aigle'' (Eagle) (captained by [[Nicolas Pierre Duclos-Guyot]]) and the sloop ''Le Sphinz'' (Sphinx) (captained by François Chenard de la Giraudais).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Falklands/Malvinas Case: Breaking The Deadlock in the Anglo-Argentine Sovereignty Dispute |author=Roberto C. Laver |ISBN=90-411-1534-X |pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expedition included the naturalist and writer [[Antoine-Joseph Pernety]] (known as Dom Pernety), the priest and chronicler accompanying the expedition, together with the engineer and geographer Lhuillier de la Serre.&lt;ref name="Expedition"&gt;[http://www.tmbl.gu.se/libdb/taxon/personetymol/exped.html Essential Oceanic Expeditions from the beginning of Zoological binominal nomenclature until the 1950s.]; accessed : 1 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition arrived in late January 1764 in French Bay (later renamed Berkeley Sound). They landed at [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Port Louis]] named after [[King Louis XV]]. A formal ceremony of possession of the Islands was held on 5 April 1764, after which Bougainville and Pernety returned to France. Louis XV formally ratified possession on 12 September 1764.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Although the French colony did not number more than 150 people, for financial motivations (Bougainville having paid for the expeditions) and diplomatic reasons (Spain feared that the Falklands would become a rear base to attack her Peruvian gold), Bougainville was ordered by the French government to dismantle his colony and sell it to the Spanish. Bougainville received 200,000 francs in Paris and an additional 500,000 francs in Buenos Aires. Spain agreed to maintain the colony in Port Louis, thus preventing Britain from claiming title to the islands.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Spain had claimed dominion before the French settlement in association with its colonies on the mainland. On 31 January 1767 at [[Río de la Plata]], Bougainville met Don Felipe Ruiz Puente, commanding the frigate ''La Esmeralda ''and ''La Liebre'' ("''the Hare''") and future governor of Islas Malvinas, to transfer possession and evacuate the French population.

Bougainville wrote: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was not before 1766, that the English sent a colony to settle in Port de la Croisade, which they had named Port Egmont; and captain Macbride, of the Jason frigate, came to our settlement the same year, in the beginning of December. He pretended that these parts belonged to his Britannic majesty, threatened to land by force, if he should be any longer refused that liberty, visited the governor, and sailed away again the same day.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/VoyageAroundTheWorldByLewisDeBougainvilleIn1766-9 |"Voyage Around The World By Lewis De Bougainville in 1766-9"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Circumnavigation===
[[Image:La Boudeuse.jpg|thumb|The ''[[French frigate Boudeuse (1766)|Boudeuse]]'', of Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]
In 1766 Bougainville received from [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] permission to [[circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] the globe. He would become the 14th navigator, and the first Frenchman, to sail around the world. Completion of his mission bolstered the prestige of France following its defeats during the [[Seven Years' War]]. This was the first expedition to circumnavigate the globe with professional naturalists and geographers aboard.

Bougainville left [[Nantes]] on 15 November 1766 with two ships: [[French frigate La Boudeuse (1766)|''Boudeuse'']] (captain : [[Nicolas Pierre Duclos-Guyot]]) and the ''[[French fluyt Étoile (1767)|Étoile]]'' (commanded by François Chenard de la Giraudais). This was a large expedition, with a crew of 214 aboard ''Boudeuse'' and 116 aboard ''Étoile''.

Included in the party was the botanist [[Philibert Commerçon]] (who named the flower ''[[Bougainvillea]]'') and his valet. The ship's surgeon later revealed this person as [[Jeanne Baré]], possibly Commerçon's mistress; she would become the first woman known to circumnavigate the globe. Other notable people on this expedition were Count [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse|Jean-François de Galaup de la Pérouse]] (member of the crew); the astronomer [[Pierre-Antoine Veron]]; the surgeon of ''Boudeuse'' Dr. Louis-Claude Laporte; the surgeon of the ''Étoile'' Dr. François Vives; the engineer and cartographer aboard the Étoile Charles Routier de Romainville; and the writer and historian Louis-Antoine Starot de Saint-Germain.&lt;ref name="Expedition" /&gt;

===Tahiti===
[[File:Bougainville at Tahiti.png|thumb|Bougainville reaching Tahiti]]
He saw islands of the [[Tuamotu]] group on the following 22 March, on 2 April saw the peak of [[Mehetia]] and visited the island of [[Tahiti|Otaheite]] shortly after. He narrowly missed becoming their discoverer; a previous visit and claim had been made by British explorer [[Samuel Wallis]] in [[HMS Dolphin (1751)|HMS ''Dolphin'']] less than a year previously. Bougainville claimed the island for France and named it ''New Cythera''.

His expedition left Tahiti and sailed westward to southern [[Samoa]] and the [[New Hebrides]], then on sighting [[Espiritu Santo]] turned west still looking for the ''Southern Continent''. On 4 June he almost ran into heavy breakers and had to change course to the north and east. He had almost found the [[Great Barrier Reef]]. He sailed through what is now known as the [[Solomon Islands]] but, because of the hostility of the people there, avoided landing. He named [[Bougainville Island]] for himself.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The expedition was attacked by people from [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] so the French expedition made for the [[Moluccas]]. At [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], they received news of [[Samuel Wallis|Wallis]] and [[Philip Carteret|Carteret]] who had preceded Bougainville in discovering Tahiti.

===Return to France===
[[File:Bougainville - Traité du calcul intégral, 1754 - 162404.jpg|thumb|'' Traité du calcul intégral'', 1754]]

On 16 March 1769 the expedition completed its circumnavigation and arrived at [[St Malo]]. It had lost only seven of its 340 men, an extremely low level of casualties. This result was considered a credit to the enlightened management of the expedition by Bougainville.&lt;ref name="Anne"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salmond|first1=Anne|title=Aphrodite's Island|date=2010|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520261143|pages=90,118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bougainville brought Ahutoru back to France, the first Tahitian to sail aboard a European vessel.  In France, Bougainville introduced the Tahitian to high society, including introducing him to the King and Queen at [[Versailles]].  Bougainville also underwrote part of the costs for Ahutoru's return to Tahiti after a two-year absence.  Unfortunately, Ahutoru died en route of smallpox in Oct. 1771.&lt;ref name=Anne/&gt;{{rp|122–123}}

===''Voyage autour du monde''===
[[File:Bougainville Voyage around the World 1772.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Cover page of the English edition of Bougainville's travelogue (1772).]]In 1771, Bougainville published his travel log from the expedition under the title ''Le voyage autour du monde, par la frégate ''La Boudeuse'', et la flûte ''L'Étoile (a.k.a. ''Voyage autour du monde'' and ''A Voyage Around the World''). The book describes the geography, biology and anthropology of [[Argentina]] (then a Spanish colony), [[Patagonia]], [[Tahiti]] and [[Indonesia]] (then a [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] colony). The book was a sensation, especially the description of Tahitian society. Bougainville described it as an earthly paradise where men and women lived in blissful innocence, far from the corruption of civilisation.

Bougainville's descriptions powerfully expressed the concept of the [[noble savage]], influencing the [[utopian]] thoughts of philosophers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] before the advent of the [[French Revolution]]. [[Denis Diderot]]'s book ''[[Supplément au voyage de Bougainville]]'' retells the story of Bougainville's landing on Tahiti, narrated by an anonymous reader to one of his friends. Diderot used his fictional approach, including a description of the Tahitians as noble savages, to criticise Western ways of living and thinking.&lt;ref name=Anne/&gt;{{rp|117,121}}

==American Revolutionary War==
After an interval of several years, Bougainville again accepted a naval command and saw much active service between 1779 and 1782 during the [[American Revolutionary War]], when France was as an ally of the rebels. He played a crucial part in the French victory at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], which led to the eventual defeat of Great Britain.

===Battle of the Saintes===
In the memorable engagement of the [[Battle of the Saintes]], in which Admiral [[George Rodney]] defeated the [[Comte de Grasse]], Bougainville, who commanded the ''[[French ship Auguste (1778)|Auguste]]'', succeeded in rallying eight ships of his own division, and bringing them safely into [[Saint Eustace]]. He was promoted to ''[[chef d'escadre]].'' When he re-entered the army, he was commissioned as ''[[maréchal de camp]]''.

After the peace of 1783, Bougainville returned to Paris. He obtained the place of associate of the Academy. He proposed a voyage of discovery to the [[North Pole]] but did not gain the support of the French government.

==Promotion and retirement==

In 1787, he became a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. He obtained the rank of vice-admiral in 1791.

In 1794, having escaped from the [[Reign of Terror]], he retired to his estate in [[Normandy]]. Returning to Paris, he was one of the founding members of the [[Bureau des Longitudes]]. In 1799, the Consul [[Napoleon]] made him a senator. He died in Paris on 31 August 1811.

== Legacy and honours ==

*[[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]]'s name is given to the largest eastern island of [[Papua New Guinea]]; and to the [[Bougainville Strait|strait]] which divides it from the island of [[Choiseul Island|Choiseul]]. It is also applied to the strait between [[Mallicollo]] and [[Espiritu Santo]] islands of the [[New Hebrides]] group. In the Falklands, [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Port Louis]], and "[[Lively Island|Isla Bougainville]]" (Lively Island's Spanish name) commemorate him.
*The genus of South American climbing shrubs with colourful bracts, ''[[Bougainvillea]]'', is named after him.
*1804, he was made a Grand Officier de la Légion d'honneur in 1804. 
*1808, Napoleon gave him the title of count (the Comte de Bougainville).
*Thirteen ships of the [[French Navy]] have been named in his honour, see [[French ship Bougainville|French ship ''Bougainville'']].

In '''M-SG''' an [[alkali metal]] is absorbed into [[silica gel]] at elevated temperatures. The resulting black powder material is an effective [[reducing agent]] and safe to handle as opposed to the pure metal. The material can also be used as a [[desiccant]] and as a [[hydrogen]] source.&lt;ref&gt;''Alkali Metals Plus Silica Gel: Powerful Reducing Agents and Convenient Hydrogen Sources '' James L. Dye, Kevin D. Cram, Stephanie A. Urbin, Mikhail Y. Redko, James E. Jackson, and Michael Lefenfeld [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]], 127 (26), 9338 -9339, '''2005''' [http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/jacsat/2005/127/i26/abs/ja051786+.html Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The metal is either [[sodium]] or a sodium - [[potassium]] [[alloy]] ([[NaK|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;K]]). The molten metal is mixed with silica gel under constant agitation at [[room temperature]]. This '''phase 0''' material must be handled in an inert atmosphere. Heating phase 0 at {{convert|150|°C|°F}} takes it to '''phase I'''. When this material is exposed to dry oxygen the reducing power is not affected. At further heating to {{convert|400|°C|°F}} '''phase II''' can be handled safely in an ambient environment. 

The metal reacts with the silica gel in an [[exothermic reaction]] in which Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; [[nanotechnology|nanoparticles]] are formed. The powder reacts with water to form [[hydrogen]]. 

Compounds such as [[biphenyl]] and [[naphthalene]] are reduced by the powder and form highly coloured [[radical ion|radical anion]]s. The powder can also be introduced in a [[column chromatography]] setup and eluted with organic reactants in order to probe the reducing power. The powder is mixed with additional (wet) silica gel which provides additional hydrogen. A [[Birch reduction]] of naphthalene takes 5 minutes [[elution time]]. The column converts benzyl chloride to [[bibenzyl]] in a [[Wurtz coupling]] and in a similar fashion dibenzothiophene is reduced to [[biphenyl]].

'''Nucellar embryony''' (notated '''Nu+''') is a form of [[seed]] [[reproduction]] that occurs in certain plant species, including many [[citrus]] varieties.  During the development of seeds in plants that possess this genetic [[Trait (biology)|Trait]], the [[nucellus|nucellar]] tissue which surrounds the [[megagametophyte]] can produce additional embryos ([[polyembryony]]), which are genetically identical to the parent plant. These nucellar seedlings are [[Cloning|clones]] of the parent. By contrast, [[Zygote|zygotic]] seedlings are sexually produced and inherit [[DNA|genetic material]] from both parents. Zygotic and nucellar embryos can occur in the same seed, and a zygotic embryo can divide to produce multiple embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Aleza, P. |author2=Juárez, J. |author3=Ollitrault, P. |author4=Navarro, L. |year=2010|title=Polyembryony in non-apomictic citrus genotypes|journal=Annals of Botany|volume=106|issue=4|pages=533–545|pmid=20675656|doi=10.1093/aob/mcq148 |pmc=2944972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nucellar embryony is important to the citrus industry, as it allows for the production of uniform [[rootstock]] which yields consistent results in fruit production.  However, this trait can interfere with progress in cross-breeding; most commercial [[Grafting|scion]] varieties produce mainly nucellar seedlings which do not inherit any of the traits of the "father" plant.

==Definition==
[[File:Pressure water air (en).svg|thumb|300px|Pressure in water and air. Pascal's law applies only for fluids.]]
Pascal's principle is defined as

{{Quotation|A change in pressure at any point in an enclosed fluid at rest is transmitted undiminished to all points in the fluid.}}

This principle is stated mathematically as:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta P =\rho g (\Delta h)\,&lt;/math&gt;

:{{math|&lt;math&gt;\Delta P&lt;/math&gt;}} is the [[hydrostatic pressure]] (given in [[Pascal (unit)|pascals]] in the [[SI]] system), or the difference in pressure at two points within a fluid column, due to the weight of the fluid;
:&amp;rho; is the fluid density (in [[kilograms per cubic meter]] in the SI system);
:g is acceleration due to gravity (normally using the [[standard gravity|sea level acceleration due to Earth's gravity]], in [[metre per second squared|metres per second squared]]);
:{{math|&lt;math&gt;\Delta h&lt;/math&gt;}} is the height of fluid above the point of measurement, or the difference in elevation between the two points within the fluid column (in metres).

The intuitive explanation of this formula is that the change in pressure between two elevations is due to the [[weight]] of the fluid between the elevations. Alternatively, the result can be interpreted as a pressure change caused by the change of potential energy per unit volume of the liquid due to the existence of the gravitational field.{{Elucidate|date=May 2014}} Note that the variation with height does not depend on any additional pressures. Therefore, Pascal's law can be interpreted as saying that ''any change in pressure applied'' at any given point of the fluid is transmitted ''undiminished throughout'' the fluid.

==Explanation==
If a U-tube is filled with water and pistons are placed at each end, pressure exerted against the left piston will be transmitted throughout the liquid and against the bottom of the right piston. (The pistons are simply "plugs" that can slide freely but snugly inside the tube.) The pressure that the left piston exerts against the water will be exactly equal to the pressure the water exerts against the right piston. Suppose the tube on the right side is made wider and a piston of a larger area is used; for example, the piston on the right has 50 times the area of the piston on the left. If a 1&amp;nbsp;N load is placed on the left piston, an additional pressure due to the weight of the load is transmitted throughout the liquid and up against the larger piston. The difference between [[force]] and [[pressure]] is important: the additional pressure is exerted against the entire area of the larger piston. Since there is 50 times the area, 50 times as much force is exerted on the larger piston. Thus, the larger piston will support a 50&amp;nbsp;N load - fifty times the load on the smaller piston.

Forces can be multiplied using such a device. One [[Newton (unit)|newton]] input produces 50 newtons output. By further increasing the area of the larger piston (or reducing the area of the smaller piston), forces can be multiplied, in principle, by any amount. Pascal's principle underlies the operation of the [[hydraulic press]]. The hydraulic press does not violate [[Law of conservation of energy|energy conservation]], because a decrease in distance moved compensates for the increase in force. When the small piston is moved downward 100 centimeters, the large piston will be raised only one-fiftieth of this, or 2 centimeters. The input force multiplied by the distance moved by the smaller piston is equal to the output force multiplied by the distance moved by the larger piston; this is one more example of a simple machine operating on the same principle as a [[Lever|mechanical lever]].

Pascal's principle applies to all fluids, whether gases or liquids. A typical application of Pascal's principle for gases and liquids is the automobile lift seen in many service stations (the [[hydraulic jack]]). Increased air pressure produced by an air compressor is transmitted through the air to the surface of oil in an underground reservoir. The oil, in turn, transmits the pressure to a piston, which lifts the automobile. The relatively low pressure that exerts the lifting force against the piston is about the same as the air pressure in automobile tires. Hydraulics is employed by modern devices ranging from very small to enormous. For example, there are hydraulic pistons in almost all construction machines where heavy loads are involved.

==Pascal's barrel==
[[File:Pascal's Barrel.png|thumb|An illustration of Pascal's barrel experiment from ''The forces of nature'' by [[Amédée Guillemin]] (1872).]]
''Pascal's barrel'' is the name of a [[hydrostatics]] experiment allegedly performed by [[Blaise Pascal]] in 1646.&lt;ref name="Merriman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Merriman|first=Mansfield|authorlink=Mansfield Merriman|title=Treatise on hydraulics|edition=8|year=1903|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|J. Wiley]]|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the experiment, Pascal supposedly inserted a long  vertical tube into a [[barrel]] filled with water.  When water was poured into the vertical tube, the increase in [[hydrostatic pressure]] caused the barrel to burst.&lt;ref name="Merriman" /&gt;

The experiment is mentioned nowhere in Pascal's preserved works and it may be apocryphal, attributed to him by 19th-century French authors, among whom the experiment is known as ''crève-tonneau'' (approx.: "barrel-buster");&lt;ref&gt;perhaps first in an educational context; the attribution is found under this name in A. Merlette, ''L'encyclopédie des écoles, journal de l'enseignement primaire et professionnel'' (1863) [https://books.google.ch/books?id=3rc_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA284 p. 284] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206072130/https://books.google.ch/books?id=3rc_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA284 |date=2017-02-06 }}: ''l'expérience du crève-tonneau réalisée pour la première fois par le célèbre Biaise Pascal. ''
Ernest Menu de Saint-Mesmin, ''Problèmes de mathématiques et de physique: donnés dans les Facultés des science et notamment à la Sorbonne, avec les solutions raisonnées'', L. Hachette (1862),  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=AdoEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA380 p. 380] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206072134/https://books.google.ch/books?id=AdoEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA380 |date=2017-02-06 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
nevertheless the experiment remains associated with Pascal in many elementary physics textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. E. Canon-Tapia in: Thor Thordarson (ed.)  ''Studies in Volcanology'', 2009, {{ISBN|9781862392809}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-l_65bugsoC&amp;pg=PA273  p. 273].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications of Pascal's law==
*The underlying principle of the [[hydraulic jack]] and [[hydraulic press]].
*Force amplification in the [[hydraulic brake|braking system]] of most motor vehicles.
*Used in [[Artesian aquifer|artesian]] wells, [[water tower]]s, and [[dam]]s.
*[[Scuba diving|Scuba divers]] must understand this principle. At a depth of 10 meters under water, pressure is twice the atmospheric pressure at sea level, and increases by about 100 kPa for each increase of 10&amp;nbsp;m depth.&lt;ref name=acottLaw/&gt;
*Usually Pascal's rule is applied to confined space (static flow), but due to the continuous flow process, Pascal's principle can be applied to the [[gas lift|lift oil mechanism]] (which can be represented as a U tube with pistons on either end). However, the lift height will be in microns because energy will be drained and pressure will be diminished after each impact with the lifting material, but force exerted will be equal.
*The underlying principle of [[hot isostatic pressing]]

[[File:E-Call a Bike Pedelec.jpg|thumb|[[Deutsche Bahn]] pedelecs with rear hub motors and batteries placed inside the [[Bicycle frame|frames]]. This is the "Jetstream" from [[Riese und Müller]].]]

A '''pedelec''' (from '''ped'''al '''ele'''ctric '''c'''ycle) is a [[bicycle]] where the rider's pedalling is ''assisted'' by a small [[electric motor]]; thus it is a type of low-powered [[Electric bicycle|e-bike]]. However, unlike some other types of e-bikes, pedelecs are classified as conventional bicycles in many countries by road authorities rather than as a type of electric moped. Pedelecs include an electronic controller which cuts power to the motor when the rider is not pedalling or when a certain speed – usually {{Convert|25|km/h|abbr=on}} – is reached.  Pedelecs are useful for people who ride in hilly areas or in strong [[headwind]]s. While a pedelec can be any [[List of bicycle types|type of bicycle]], a pedelec [[European city bike|city bike]] is very common. A conventional bicycle can be converted to a pedelec with the addition of the necessary parts, i.e. motor, battery etc.

Many jurisdictions [[#Legal status of pedelecs worldwide|classify pedelecs]] as bicycles as opposed to [[moped]]s or motorcycles. More powerful [[e-bike]]s, such as the [[Electric bicycle#S-Pedelecs|S-Pedelecs]] and ''power-on-demand'' e-bikes (those whose motors can provide assistance regardless of whether the rider is pedalling or not) are often classified as mopeds or even motorcycles with the rider thus subject to the regulations of such motor vehicles, e.g. having a license and a vehicle registration, wearing a helmet etc.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Pedelecs provide various advantages over conventional bicycles:
* ''Mobility'': People in hilly areas can cycle using a pedelec rather than having to rely on fully motorised transport (i.e. cars or motorbikes). This is particularly useful to the elderly who may no longer have the capacity for the strenuous effort that climbing demands.
* ''Speed'': Distances can be covered more quickly, as the average speed is greater while the effort can remain the same. 
* ''Effort'': Alternatively, the same speeds can be reached with less effort. This means that a cyclist on a pedelec may avoid undue perspiration – particularly when going uphill or against the wind – so [[bicycle commuting]] in work clothes is less problematic, i.e. eliminating the need to change and/or shower upon getting to work.
* ''Greater range'': As the cyclist is less fatigued, and average speeds higher, greater distances become feasible. 

The main disadvantage of the pedelec is its price, which is significantly higher than that of similar, but conventional [[bicycle]]s.  The other additional expenses are minor: these are the [[electricity]] recharging costs and the eventual replacement of the [[Battery (electricity)|battery]], which together have been calculated to cost a mere €0.20 - €0.40 per 100&amp;nbsp;km.
Other disadvantages are higher risk of theft due to its higher value, and the pedelec's higher weight caused by the battery, motor and sturdier frame.

== History ==
In 1989, Michael Kutter, founder of ''Dolphin E-bikes'', designed and produced the first pedelec prototype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meilensteine des Dolphin e-Bikes (Milestones of Dolphin e-bikes)|url=http://www.dolphin-ebike.ch/mainnav/story/|accessdate=23 March 2013|language=German|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330101103/http://www.dolphin-ebike.ch/mainnav/story/|archivedate=30 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first market-ready models of this kind were available in 1992 from the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] company ''Velocity'' under the name ''Dolphin''.

In 1994, larger numbers were produced by [[Yamaha Motor|Yamaha]] under the name ''Power Assist''.

In 1995, the first ''Flyer'' in the same year founded the Swiss start-up company ''BKTech AG'' in small series by [[e-business]] (as an integral part of the start-up) to the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BKTech AG|url=http://www.ecademy.ch/ecademy/ecadpubli.nsf/45ED80EADB3E3C09C12569A4005EEFD6/$file/7_bktech.pdf|work=ecademy.ch|accessdate=23 March 2013|language=German|format=PDF|date=1997–2001}} {{dead link|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''pedelec'' was coined by Susanne Brüsch in her 1999 thesis ''Pedelecs: Vehicles of the Future'' ({{lang-de|Pedelecs: Fahrzeuge der Zukunft}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Pedelecs: Fahrzeuge der Zukunft |trans-title=Pedelecs: Vehicles of the future |url= http://extraenergy.org/main.php?language=de&amp;category=&amp;subcateg=&amp;id=22 |publisher= [[Heidelberg University]] |first= Susanne |last= Brüsch |language= German |date= April 1999 |accessdate= 29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pedelec market penetration ==

=== Europe ===
Throughout the whole of Europe in 2011, between 900,000 and 1.24 million units were sold; this is 29% more than in 2010.

It has been predicted that in 2015, 3 million e-bikes will be sold in Europe, and these will mostly be pedelecs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bike Europe - EU-2010: E-bikes Rising Star in All Major Markets|url=http://www.bike-eu.com/Sales-Trends/Market-Report/2011/9/bEU-2010b-E-bikes-Rising-Star-in-All-Major-Markets-BIK005299W/|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Germany ====
{{As of|2012}} there were about 600,000 pedelecs on the road in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pedelec, Segway, Bierbike: Lust oder Last? - Arbeitskreis auf dem 50. Deutschen Verkehrsgerichtstag|url=http://www.nationaler-radverkehrsplan.de/termine/termin.php?id=3478|accessdate=23 March 2013|language=German|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth has been spectacular: the year before, 310,000-340,000 pedelecs were sold in Germany and this in turn was 55% more than in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Go Pedelec! Handbuch mit wertvollen Praxistipps|url=http://extraenergy.org/main.php?language=de&amp;category=information&amp;subcateg=21&amp;id=27585|page=14|language=German|format=PDF|year=2012|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in Germany sales have gone up by more than 30% every year since 2008.&lt;ref name="ZIV-WiPK2012" /&gt; In comparison, there were around 70 million conventional [[bicycle]]s in Germany in 2011 according to ZIV, the German Bicycle Industry Association.&lt;ref name="ZIV-WiPK2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Präsentation zur Wirtschaftspressekonferenz|url=http://www.ziv-zweirad.de/public/pk_2012-ziv-praesentation_21-03-2012.pdf|publisher=Zweirad-Industrie-Verband (ZIV)|accessdate=22 March 2013|language=German|format=PDF|date=21 March 2012|quote=Die angegebene Spanne des durchschnittlichen Verkaufspreises schließt auch die vernachlässigbar wenigen ausschließlich elektrisch angetriebenen Räder mit ein.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202064332/http://www.ziv-zweirad.de/public/pk_2012-ziv-praesentation_21-03-2012.pdf|archivedate=2 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 95% of all [[e-bike]]s in Germany are in fact pedelecs.

[[ADAC]], the German (auto)motive club has tested a large number of pedelecs in 2013, where about 70% of the pedelecs failed the test with a score lower than reasonable due to unsatisfactory safety and durability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ADAC Test Fahrräder mit Elektroantrieb 2013|url=http://www.adac.de/infotestrat/tests/fahrrad-zubehoer-sport/pedelec_2013/?tabid=tab1|website=www.adac.de|accessdate=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elsewhere===
Only the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] market for pedelecs and e-bikes is bigger than the European. According to the National Bureau of Statistics in China more than 100 million e-bikes are on the road. The annual production in Chinese factories has increased from 58,000 (1998) to 33 million in (2011).

== Legal status of pedelecs worldwide==
To really be useful, it is important for a pedelec to be ''legally classified as a bicycle'' in each country or jurisdiction rather than classified as a moped or motorcycle. Otherwise, if a pedelec is classified as a moped or motorbike then it may not be allowed in [[bike lane]]s or on [[bike path]]s; the pedelec may have to be [[Vehicle registration|registered]]; the rider may have to wear a [[motorcycle helmet]]; and/or [[vehicle insurance]] may have to be paid for.

=== Europe ===

In the EU this means it is important to legally distinguish between pedelecs and other [[e-bike]]s (including [[Electric bicycle#S-Pedelecs|S-Pedelecs]]) as these are likely to 
* have a more powerful motor than 250 W, 
* they may be able to attain a higher speed than 25&amp;nbsp;km/h before the electric motor assistance cuts out (if it cuts out at all), and/or 
* may have the ability to travel via electric motor alone (i.e. without pedalling). 
If any of those three conditions are true, then the bike is therefore more likely to be legally classified as a moped or motorcycle rather than as a bicycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32002L0024 |title= DIRECTIVE 2002/24/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 18 March 2002 relating to the type-approval of two or three-wheel motor vehicles and repealing Council Directive 92/61/EEC |format= [[PDF]] |website= eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate= 2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Austria (Highway Code and CFG) ====
According to § 2 para 1 of 22 StVO 1960 two types of electric bikes can be distinguished:
* Lit. "B) a [bike], which in addition to an electric drive according to § 1 2 [[Motor Vehicles Act 1967|KFG 1967]] is equipped (electric bike)" (thus hybrid drive according pedelec definition ''' ');
* Lit. "D) an electrically driven vehicle, the drive corresponds to an electric bicycle as defined in § 1 paragraph 2a KFG 1967" (thus a just-electric drive).

Not as motor vehicles under § 1 paragraph 2a KFG apply electric bicycles - whether hybrid ''(pedelec) ''or exclusively powered by electricity - with a bicycle for purposes of traffic 1960
# A maximum permissible power of not more than 600 watts, and
# a design speed not exceeding 25&amp;nbsp;km/h.

Provided above criteria are not exceeded is, therefore, under Austrian law, such an electric bike / pedelec not as electric power ''rad ''and therefore requires neither approval nor vehicle registration. As for normal (only muscle powered) bikes, also for electric bikes, the provisions of bicycle Regulation, for the control of these are the same as those for muscle StVO-powered bicycles, etc. Mandatory use of the bike path lane with bicycles. For their (commercial) In placing on the market subject to the product liability provisions.

In Austria, [[Electric bicycle#S-Pedelecs|S-Pedelecs]] (power-assisted pedalling up to 45&amp;nbsp;km/h) are not classified as bicycles. Whether they lit at best as [[moped]] According to Article 1 paragraph 2. A) Directive 2002/24/EC (or as [[motorbike]] § 2 Abs 1 line 14 KFG) are typable and registered as a motor vehicle can be driven, so far (October 2010 has not survived).

==== The Netherlands ====
The true Pedelecs are not required to have any other prerequisities than a bicycle has.

However, any pedelec where the power assistance is triggered by merely turning wheels rather than pedal motion (a large number of cheap versions or notoriously front hub assistance), are required to have a licence plate for a scooter / small motorcycle (so called [[:nl:Snorfiets|snorfiets]] or [[:nl:Bromfiets|bromfiets]]), a valid driving licence and an insurance.

In case of the power assistance stopping at a speed up to 25&amp;nbsp;km/h, the riders are not required to carry motorcycle helmets, however, this speed limit shall not be exceeded even while pedaling only.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
Electric bicycles, for example [[Specialized Turbo]], without 25&amp;nbsp;km/h speed limitation for power assistance are considered a small motorcycle and besides license plate (yellow with black letters), driving license and insurance, a '''motorcycle helmet''' must be worn at all time from the start of 2017 and onwards.

Very surprisingly, a large fleet of electric bicycles and pedelecs without required power control linked to the pedaling effort can be seen on the cycling paths without any proper registration.
Additionally, many users found very simple ways how to tweak their pedelecs in order to overcome the pedaling sensor, making their pedelecs without further proper vehicle registration illegal.

=== Asia ===

==== Hong Kong ====

Pedelecs, and all kinds of mechanical assist, are regarded as "motor vehicles" and classified as motor cycles, making legal registration impossible. The Hong Kong [[Transport Department]] is currently conducting a review, with a first report expected in mid-2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201305/08/P201305070364.htm|title=LCQ19: Illegal sale or use of electric bicycles|date=8 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.td.gov.hk/filemanager/en/content_1863/fcq%202018-19%20eng.pdf (Hong Kong Government) Examination of Estimates of Expenditure 2018-19]: Regarding the "Consultancy Study on Enhancing the Walkability in Hong Kong" &lt;/ref&gt;

==== Singapore ====

Pedelecs are allowed, when wearing a helmet, the motor output is limited to 200W and the motor cuts out by 25&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onemotoring.com.sg/publish/onemotoring/en/lta_information_guidelines/buy_a_new_vehicle/motorised_bicycles.MainPar.21283.File.tmp/MotorisedBicycle_Safety_Guide.pdf |title='''P'''ower '''A'''ssisted '''B'''icycles (PAB) |publisher=Land Transport Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== India ====

Electric vehicles with a motor having power less than 250W, and a maximum speed 25 km/h or lower, are not required to be registered under the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, and may be driven freely without any license/paperwork. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.araiindia.com/faqs_electric_vehicle.asp|title=FAQs regarding electric vehicles|publisher=Automotive Research Association of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
Electric-assisted bicycles are treated as human-powered bicycles, while bicycles capable of propulsion by electric power alone face additional registration and regulatory requirements as mopeds. Requirements include electric power generation by a motor that cannot be easily modified, along with a power assist mechanism that operates safely and smoothly. In December 2008, The assist ratio was updated as follow:
*Under 10&amp;nbsp;km/h; 2
*10–24&amp;nbsp;km/h; 2-(Running speed - 10) / 7
*Over 24&amp;nbsp;km/h; 0

''(See [[Moped#Individual countries/regions]])''

=== Australia ===
As of 30 May 2012, Australia has an additional new electric bicycle category using the European model of a "Pedelec" as per EN15194 Standard. This means the bicycle can have a motor of 250 watts continuous rated power which must be activated only by pedalling (if above 6&amp;nbsp;km/h) and must cut out over 25&amp;nbsp;km/h. The [[Victoria (Australia)|State of Victoria]] is the first to amend their local road rules to accommodate this new standard as of 18 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power assisted bicycles |url=http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/SafetyAndRules/SaferRiders/BikeRiders/PowerAssistedBicycles.htm |publisher=[[VicRoads]] |accessdate=21 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328200435/http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/SafetyAndRules/SaferRiders/BikeRiders/PowerAssistedBicycles.htm |archivedate=28 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical ==

=== Components ===
Pedelecs differ from an ordinary [[bicycle]] by an additional [[electric motor]], a battery, an electronic control system for the motor as well as a [[sensor]] to detect the motion of the cranks. Most models are also equipped with a battery charge indicator and a motor power setting, either continuously or divided into support levels.

==== Battery ====
Besides the motor, the battery is the main component of pedelec technology. It is usually either a [[NiMH]] - [[Nickel|Ni]] - or a [[lithium-ion battery]]. The [[Electric charge|battery]] capacity is up to 24 [[Ampere-hour|Ah]] n (Ah) at 24 or 36 [[V]] (V) or up to 15 amp hours at 48 volts. The stored [[energy]] can be up to about 800 [[watt hour]] n (Wh), but mostly about 400 Wh (2013). In ideal conditions, after a thousand charges NiCd batteries have 85% of their original capacity and are therefore considered worn. With NiMH batteries about 400 to 800 cycles are possible. The charging time depending on the type of battery is around 2 to 9 hours. The durability of the battery is dependent on other factors. As lead-acid batteries discharge they provide less [[Voltage|power]], so that full motor power is no longer achieved. The very light, more expensive [[lithium-ion battery|lithium ion batteries]] are now used by most manufacturers and have a range of up to 100 kilometers with moderate pedaling and a medium capacity battery (e.g. 15 Ah). Lithium batteries do not tolerate [[frost]] and should not be charged at frosty temperatures. For safety, the chemical composition and the quality of the electronics are crucial. Especially with short circuit and over voltage, lithium-ion batteries react very strongly. These problems in laptops have led to recalls. Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries are a notable exception. They have far safer thermal characteristics as well as being non-toxic.

In evaluating pedelec batteries, it is useful to consider not only the capacity, but also criteria such as durability, memory effect, charging time, weight, safety and environmental protection.

Manufacturers which equip their pedelecs with NiCd batteries usually deliver them with an AC adapter that discharges the battery completely before the actual charging process in order to decrease the [[memory effect]]. NiMH batteries have a much lower memory effect. With lithium-ion batteries there is no memory effect.

A [[lithium iron phosphate battery]] is much longer-lived than a lithium-ion battery. Its use significantly reduces operating costs resulting from battery wear. In 2013, they are not yet available as standard in most pedelec models, but some pedelecs (e.g. Beyond Oil) have begun installing LFP batteries as standard.

==== Motor control ====
For switching or control of the motor, there are several possibilities:
* Measuring the force or torque on the signal of a [[force-sensing resistor|force sensor]]s on the pedals, the pedal crank, the chain or at the wheel
* Measurement of treading on the signal from a revolution counter or [[Schmitt trigger|threshold switch]]es on the crank, or at another suitable location
* Measurement of both force and the speed
* Measurement of acceleration or drawbar force at the push trailer
* Measuring electrical values in the serial hybrid (pedal generator)

In addition, the speed of the vehicle are measured on the wheel, in particular, for example, to drive the motor from 25&amp;nbsp;km/h off.

The measurement can be further processed mechanically or electronically and is used to control the motor on and off or to regulate a control function based on continuously.

The fed [[Power (physics)|power]] is based on the sensor data (force sensor, crank speed, ground speed) is calculated based on the chosen level of support from the motor controller. The so-called support levels, that is, how much the motor supported in addition to the driver's performance lie in horizontal drive 5-400 percent.

When the motors are regularly used heavily, especially when going uphill they may heat up significantly, some have a temperature sensor in the motor winding, where if a certain temperature is reached the electronics may reduce power to the motor. Ideally the electronics disconnect the battery at a predetermined discharge voltage to prevent total discharge and to ensure sufficient supply for the operation of the lighting system. This can be done by [[electronics]] in the [[Battery (electricity)|battery]].

===== Force control =====
When running with a force sensor, the motor is automatically a certain [[percentage]] of the service provided to the driver. In many models, this proportion may be set in several stages. There are also models where the support level can be set only at the dealer to the customer.

===== Rotary motion detection =====
In the version with speed sensor (s) of the motor is automatically using a function to a set percentage of the self-applied force. Since the force required at the speed rises sharply, it can be calculated in some models without force sensor.

===== Sliding or traction =====
The slide or traction can help with Maximization of legislation to support a motor without pedaling to 6&amp;nbsp;km/h. The shift means has the advantage that you can let the bike roll alongside with motor support without pedaling or you push yourself (e.g. must, when transporting a heavy load, or so you walk up the wheel alone on a hill may be). For some models, the allowed 6&amp;nbsp;km/h can be achieved only in top gear, the other gears in the wheel rolls correspondingly slower. In any case, it allows for a faster (and more controlled physically) starting from standstill to "green" switches over [[light]] n

==== Power Electronics ====
The power electronics, depending on the type of motor, consist of a DC motor controller with [[pulse width modulation]] or a regulated DC-AC converter.

==== Motor types ====
[[File:Largehubmotordetail.jpg|thumb|Pedelec hub motor with gearbox.]]
[[File:Smart e-bike motor.JPG|thumbnail|Smart e-bike motor]]
Almost exclusively, pedelecs use DC motors, using [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]]-less and brush [[Electric motor#Pancake or axial rotor motor|disc motor]]s, which are suitable for direct drive, and brush motors with gears.

The use of maintenance-free [[AC induction motors]] pedelec is the exception.

A direct rotor hub motor may feature a [[regenerative brake]], so it can be used as a brake that converts some of the [[kinetic energy]] into battery charge. In addition to charging the battery when braking this incurs less wear on the 
traditional brake, reducing braking noises.

==== Force approach of the electric drive ====
See generally [[electric drive (bike)#starting points of the electric drive|starting points of the electric drive.]] When Pedelec specifically, the type of control of the drive by the pedaling (see above), which may be integrated in the drive.

==== Drive positions ====
The position of the motor has a significant impact on the handling of the pedelec. The following combinations of actuator position and motor have been successful:
* Motor in the [[bottom bracket]] ([[Mid-engine design|mid-engine layout]])
* Motor in the hub of the front wheel
* Motor in the hub of the rear wheel

=== Range ===
Generally the range with motor support is between 7&amp;nbsp;km for a constant rise and up to 70&amp;nbsp;km. At medium power addition, it is about 20 to 50&amp;nbsp;km. On some models, by default two successive switchable batteries are housed in luggage bags, here is the range specified at medium power addition of 100&amp;nbsp;km.

A conventional battery (36 V / 7 Ah) (1.9 to 5.1&amp;nbsp;kg mass in a pedelec&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alle Ergebnisse des Pedelec und E-Bike Tests|url=http://extraenergy.org/main.php?language=de&amp;category=&amp;subcateg=&amp;id=3861|publisher=ExtraEnergy e.V.|accessdate=21 March 2013|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;) has an energy content of around 250 Wh (1&amp;nbsp;kg of gasoline has about 11,500 Wh). The conversion of electrical energy into mechanical work is done with some loss of energy due to the generation of heat. Typically, incurred losses are around 25 percent, depending on the efficiency of the motor and the motor controller. Thus, a pedelec with a 70&amp;nbsp;kg rider (total mass of ~100&amp;nbsp;kg) can be calculated to go about 5.6 kilometres on a 10% grade at 25&amp;nbsp;km/h on battery power alone (assuming Frontal area = 0.4 meter-squared, Drag coefficient = 0.7, Altitude = 100m, Wind speed = 10&amp;nbsp;km/h and Rolling resistance coefficient = 0.007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hill Climbing (and going downhill)|url=http://www.electric-bicycle-guide.com/electric-bicycle-hills.html|accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electric Bicycle Calculators|url=http://www.electric-bicycle-guide.com/electric-bicycle-calculators.html|accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Depending on the assistance of the rider (which is required on a pedelec), a proportionally greater range is possible.

=== Safety ===
Safety issues are a concern in relatively flat areas, but are more pronounced in the hills. Hilly areas provide changing conditions; this poses the possibility of encountering more critical situations and thus more accidents may occur.   Cars may need to overtake pedelecs at higher speeds than cars would overtake regular bikes, and this may result in more accidents with serious consequences for both cyclists and drivers. For drivers and pedestrians, it may be difficult to estimate how fast a cyclist is moving. Also, an elderly on a pedelec may ride much faster than previously possible. Risky situations can also arise at exits and junctions. To illustrate the consequences of such critical situations, the [[German Insurers Accident Research]] (UDV) has conducted a research project with road tests, performance tests and crash tests for pedelecs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elektrofahrräder – Umweltschonend aber gefährlich?|url=http://www.udv.de/uploads/tx_udvpublications/110407_Pedelec_info_01.pdf|publisher=Gesamtverband der Deutschen Versicherungswirtschaft e.V.

On the other hand, many pedelec (and e-bike) users report that they can ride more defensively with the auxiliary electric drive assisting them; unlike traditional bicyclists that tend to be averse to braking since this incurs effort to accelerate again, a pedelec rider can brake and then accelerate back to a normal speed with much less effort. The [[Bavaria]]n accident statistics for the first half of 2012 lists 6,186 accidents involving bicycles, of which 76 are e-bikes and notes that the accident risk of e-bikes is not higher than for other bicycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/E-Bikes-nicht-gefaehrlicher-als-andere-Raeder-id21910861.html |title= E-Bikes nicht gefährlicher als andere Räder |work= [[Augsburger Allgemeine]] |date= 2012-09-20 |accessdate= 2013-03-21 |language= de |trans-title=E-Bikes not more dangerous than other bicycles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[Electric bicycle#S-Pedelecs|S-Pedelecs]] involves an additional risk. Not only do they achieve a higher average speed, but a higher top speed (usually 45&amp;nbsp;km/h) and can also expect a higher annual [[Fuel economy in automobiles|mileage]].

As with all [[plutonium]] compounds, it is subject to control under the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]].  Due to the radioactivity of plutonium, all of its compounds, PuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; included, are warm to the touch. Such contact is not recommended, since touching the material may result in serious injury.

[[Lake Karachay]], located in the southern Ural Mountains in eastern [[Russia]], was a dumping ground for the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[nuclear weapon]] facilities. It was also affected by a string of [[Nuclear and radiation accidents|accidents and disasters]] causing the surrounding areas to be highly contaminated with [[radioactive waste]]. [[Washington, D.C.]]-based [[Worldwatch Institute]] has described it as the "most [[pollution|polluted]] spot on Earth".&lt;ref name="Lenssen"&gt;Lenssen, "Nuclear Waste: The Problem that Won't Go Away", Worldwatch Institute, Washington, D.C., 1991: 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Russia|author = Andrea Pelleschi|year = 2013|publisher = [[ABDO Publishing Company]]|isbn = 9781614808787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History == 
Built in the late 1940s [[Mayak]] was one of Russia's most prominent nuclear weapons factories. Mayak was kept secret by the government until 1990. When Russian president [[Boris Yeltsin]] signed a 1992 decree opening the area, Western scientists were able to gain access. The sediment of the lake bed is estimated to be composed almost entirely of high level radioactive waste deposits to a depth of roughly 11 feet (3.4 m).

In 1994, a report revealed that 5 million cubic meters of polluted water had migrated from Lake Karachay, and was spreading to the south and north at 80 meters per year, "threatening to enter water intakes and rivers".&lt;ref&gt;Lavernov, N. P., B. I. Omelianeako, and V. I. Velichkin. 1994. Geological aspects of the nuclear waste disposal problem. Berkeley: Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors acknowledged that "theoretical hazards developed into actual events".

In November 1994, officials from the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy stated that Soviet officials initiated a process following the 1957 [[Kyshtym disaster]] resulting in the transfer of 3 billion curies of high level nuclear waste into deep wells at three other sites.&lt;ref&gt;"Critical Masses: Citizens, Nuclear Weapons Production, and Environmental Destruction in the United States and Russia", by Russell J. Dalton, 1999, p.79&lt;/ref&gt;

The Techa river, which provides water to nearby areas, was contaminated, and about 65% of local residents fell ill with radiation sickness. Doctors called it the "special disease" because they were not allowed to note radiation in their diagnoses as long as the facility was secret. In the village of Metlino, it was found that 65% of residents were suffering from chronic radiation sickness. Workers at the plutonium plant were also affected.

== Causes ==
The pollution of Lake Karachay is connected to the disposal of nuclear materials from [[Mayak]]. Among workers, [[cancer]] mortality remains an issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=12751962 | volume=159 | issue=6 | title=Cancer mortality risk among workers at the Mayak nuclear complex | year=2003 | journal=Radiat Res | pages=787–98 | author=Shilnikova NS, Preston DL, Ron E, [[Ethel Gilbert|Gilbert ES]], Vassilenko EK, Romanov SA, Kuznetsova IS, Sokolnikov ME, Okatenko PV, Kreslov VV, Koshurnikova NA | doi=10.1667/0033-7587(2003)159[0787:cmrawa]2.0.co;2| bibcode=2003RadR..159..787S }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Mayak's existence was officially recognized, there had been a 21% rise in cancer cases, a 25% rise in birth defects, and a 41% rise in leukemia in the surrounding region of Chelyabinsk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2215023/Is-polluted-place-Earth-The-Russian-lake-hour-beach-kill-you.html Is this the most polluted place on Earth?

== Prevalence of pollution ==
[[Nuclear waste]], either from civilian or military nuclear projects, remains a serious [[Environmental issues in Russia|threat to the environment of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Politics of Environmental Policy in Russia", p. 34, by David Lewis Feldman, Ivan Blokov&lt;/ref&gt; Reports suggest that there are few or no road signs warning about the polluted areas surrounding Lake Karachay.&lt;ref&gt;"The Burning Lake: A Volk Thriller", by Brent Ghelfi, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Some parts of the lake are extremely radioactive (600 röntgens/hour) and one could receive a lethal dose of radiation in 30 minutes (300 röntgens).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The [[Uranium-238]] from which most of the [[isotopes of plutonium|plutonium isotope]]s derive, by [[neutron capture]], is frequently found alongside the U-235 fuel in civilian reactors, in the form of [[Low enriched uranium]]. 

In contrast to the low burnup of weeks or months that is commonly required to produce [[weapons-grade plutonium]](WGPu/[[plutonium-239|&lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu]]), the long time in the reactor that produces reactor-grade plutonium leads to [[nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] of much of the [[fissile]], relatively long [[half-life]] isotope [[plutonium-239|&lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu]] into a number of other [[isotopes of plutonium]] that are less fissile or more radioactive.

[[Thermal-neutron reactor]]s (today's most numerous [[nuclear power station]]s) can reuse reactor-grade plutonium only to a limited degree as [[MOX fuel]], and only for a second cycle; [[fast-neutron reactor]]s, of which there are fewer than a handful operating today, can use reactor-grade plutonium fuel as a means to reduce the [[transuranium]] content of [[spent nuclear fuel]]/nuclear waste.

At the beginning of the industrial scale production of plutonium-239 in war era ''[[nuclear reactor|production reactors]]'', trace contamination or co-production with [[plutonium-240]] was initially observed, with these trace amounts resulting in the dropping of the [[Thin Man (nuclear bomb)|Thin Man]] weapon-design as unworkable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120301130234/http://www.chemcases.com/2003version/nuclear/nc-09.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in purity, of how much, continues to be important in assessing significance in the context of [[nuclear proliferation]] and weapons-usability.

The [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] definition of ''reactor grade'' [[plutonium]] changed in 1976. Before this, three grades were recognised. The change in the definition for ''reactor grade'', from describing plutonium with greater than 7% [[Plutonium-240|Pu-240]] content prior to 1976, to  ''reactor grade'' being defined as containing 19% or more Pu-240, coincides with the 1977 release of information about a 1962 "''reactor grade'' nuclear test". The question of which definition or designation applies, that, of the old or new scheme, to the 1962 "reactor-grade" test, has not been officially disclosed.

*'''[[Plutonium-239#Supergrade_plutonium|Super weapons grade]]''', less than 3% [[Plutonium-240|Pu-240]],
*'''[[Weapons grade]]''', less than 7% Pu-240 and
*'''Reactor grade''', 7% or more Pu-240.
From 1976, four grades were recognised:
*'''Super weapons grade''', less than 3% [[Plutonium-240|Pu-240]]
*'''Weapons grade''', less than 7% Pu-240,
*'''Fuel grade''', 7% to 19% Pu-240 and
*'''Reactor grade''', more than 19% Pu-240.&lt;ref name="fas"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fas.org/nuke/intro/nuke/plutonium.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701133701/http://www.fas.org/nuke/intro/nuke/plutonium.htm |archivedate=2013-07-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[nuclear reprocessing|Reprocessing]] or recycling of the [[spent fuel]] from the most common class of civilian-electricity-generating or ''power reactor'' design, the [[LWR]], (with examples being the [[pressurized water reactor|PWR]] or [[BWR]])  recovers ''reactor grade'' plutonium (as defined since 1976), not ''fuel grade''.&lt;ref&gt;http://info.ornl.gov/sites/publications/Files/Pub37993.pdf Categorization of Used Nuclear Fuel Inventory in Support of a Comprehensive National Nuclear Fuel Cycle Strategy. page 34 figure 20.

The physical mixture of isotopes in reactor-grade plutonium make it extremely difficult to handle and form and therefore explains its undesirability as a weapon-making substance, in contrast to weapons grade plutonium, which can be handled relatively safely with thick gloves.&lt;ref name="fas" /&gt;

To produce [[weapons grade]] plutonium, the uranium nuclear fuel must spend no longer than several weeks in the reactor core before being removed, creating a low fuel [[burnup]]. For this to be carried out in a [[pressurized water reactor]] - the most common reactor design for electricity generation - the reactor would have to prematurely reach [[shutdown (nuclear reactor)|cold shut down]] after only recently being fueled, meaning that the reactor would need to cool [[decay heat]] and then have its [[reactor pressure vessel]] be depressurized, followed by a [[fuel rod]] defueling. If such an operation were to be conducted, it would be easily detectable,&lt;ref name="fas" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170711002254/http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/publications/Pages/the-categorisation-of-nuclear-material-in-the-context-of-integrated-safeguards.aspx The categorisation of nuclear material in the context of integrated safeguards]&lt;/ref&gt; and require prohibitively costly reactor modifications.&lt;ref name="depletedcranium" /&gt;

One example of how this process could be detected in [[Pressurized water reactor|PWRs]], is that during these periods, there would be a considerable amount of down time, that is, large stretches of time that the reactor is not producing electricity to the grid.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifpa.org/publications/MDRequirements2010/chapter4.php&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the modern definition of "reactor grade" plutonium is produced only when the reactor is run at high [[burnup]]s and therefore producing a high electricity generating [[capacity factor]]. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2009 the [[capacity factor]] of US nuclear power stations was higher than all other forms of energy generation, with nuclear reactors producing power approximately 90.3% of the time and Coal [[thermal power plant]]s at 63.8%, with down times being for simple routine maintenance and refuelling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/archive/03482009.pdf Electric Power Annual 2009] Table 5.2 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree to which typical [[Generation II reactor]] high [[burnup|burn-up]] produced reactor-grade plutonium is less useful than [[weapons-grade plutonium]] for building [[nuclear weapon]]s is somewhat debated, with many sources arguing that the maximum probable theoretical yield would be bordering on a [[Fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzle]] explosion of the range 0.1 to 2 [[kiloton]] in a [[Fat Man]] type device. As computations state that the energy yield of a nuclear explosive decreases by one and two [[orders of magnitude]] if the 240 Pu content increases from 5% (nearly weapons-grade plutonium) to 15%( 2 kt) and 25%,(0.2 kt) respectively.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Şahin|first=Sümer|date=1981|title=Remarks On The Plutonium-240 Induced Pre-Ignition Problem In A Nuclear Device|url=http://www.ans.org/pubs/journals/download/a_32795|journal=Nuclear Technology|volume=54|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|pages=431–432|quote=The energy yield of a nuclear explosive decreases by one and two orders of magnitude if the 240 Pu content increases from 5 (nearly weapons-grade plutonium) to 15 and 25%, respectively.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These computations are theoretical and assume the non-trivial issue of dealing with the heat generation from the higher content of non-weapons usable [[Pu-238]] could be overcome.) As the premature initiation from the [[spontaneous fission]] of [[Pu-240]] would ensure a low explosive yield in such a device, the surmounting of both issues in the construction of an [[Improvised nuclear device]] is described as presenting "daunting" hurdles for a [[Fat Man]]-era implosion design, and the possibility of terrorists achieving this [[fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzle]] yield being regarded as an "overblown" apprehension with the safeguards that are in place.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aps.org/units/fps/newsletters/2006/april/article2.html [[American Physical Society]] ''Bombs, Reprocessing, and Reactor Grade Plutonium''

However, with all these major design considerations included, this fusion boosted reactor grade plutonium primary will still fizzle if the fission component of the primary does not deliver more than 0.2 kilotons of yield, which is regarded as the minimum energy necessary to start a fusion burn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Hardtack1.html |title= Operation Hardtack, test shot Juniper, 0.2 kt is approximately the yield of a boosted primary that fails to boost.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The probability that a fission device would fail to achieve this threshold yield increases as the [[burnup]] value of the fuel increases.&lt;ref name="J.

No information available in the public domain suggests that any well funded entity has ever seriously pursued creating, a nuclear weapon with an isotopic composition similar to modern, high burnup, reactor grade plutonium. All [[nuclear weapon state]]s have taken the more conventional path to nuclear weapons by either [[uranium enrichment]] or producing low burnup, "fuel-grade" and weapons-grade plutonium, in reactors capable of operating as [[production reactor]]s, the isotopic content of reactor-grade plutonium, created by the most common commercial power reactor design, the [[pressurized water reactor]], never directly being considered for weapons use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccnr.org/plute.html States have been willing to make large investments in some cases to acquire weapon-grade rather than reactor-grade plutonium: the United States, for example, in the 1980s, considered spending billions of dollars on the Special Isotope Separation facility to enrich reactor-grade plutonium to weapon-grade.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osti.gov/biblio/106640-virtual-instruments-los-alamos-experiment Virtual instruments -- A Los Alamos experiment.Molecular laser isotope separation (MLIS) process in a gaseous plutonium hexafluoride ]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2012, there were [[Nuclear power by country|thirty-one countries]] that have civil nuclear power plants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf01.html |title=Nuclear Power in the World Today |publisher=World-nuclear.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nine have nuclear weapons]], and almost every [[nuclear weapons state]] began producing weapons first instead of commercial nuclear power plants. The re-purposing of civilian nuclear industries for military purposes would be a breach of the [[Non-proliferation treaty]].

As nuclear reactor designs come in a wide variety and are sometimes improved over time, the isotopic ratio of what is deemed "reactor grade plutonium" in one design, as it compares to another, can differ substantially. For example the British [[Magnox]] reactor, a Generation I [[gas cooled reactor]](GCR) design, can rarely produce a fuel [[burnup]] of more than 2-5&amp;nbsp;[[kilowatt-hour|GWd]]/[[tonne|t]][[uranium|U]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2013/05/02/fancy-new-lids-for-nuclear-waste-casks-as-contents-get-hotter/ |title=Forbes magazine.

=="Reactor-grade" plutonium nuclear tests==
The '''reactor grade plutonium nuclear test''' was a "low-yield (under 20 kilotons)" [[Underground nuclear testing|underground]] [[nuclear test]] using non-[[weapons-grade]] [[plutonium]] conducted at the US [[Nevada Test Site]] in 1962.&lt;ref name=DOE-199406&gt;{{cite web |url=http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/websites/osti.gov/www.osti.gov/html/osti/opennet/document/press/pc29.html |title=Additional Information Concerning Underground Nuclear Weapon Test of Reactor-Grade Plutonium |publisher=[[US Department of Energy]] |date=June 1994 |accessdate=2007-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some information regarding this test was declassified in July 1977, under instructions from President [[Jimmy Carter]], as background to his decision to prohibit [[nuclear reprocessing]] in the USA.

The plutonium used for the US-UK 1962 device was apparently sourced from the military [[Magnox|magnox reactors]] at [[Calder Hall]] or [[Chapelcross]] in the United Kingdom, and provided to the US under the [[1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement]].&lt;ref name=DOE-199406/&gt; Only two US-UK underground nuclear tests occurred in 1962, the first being test shot ''[[ET.317|Pampas]]'' of [[Operation Nougat]] which produced a yield of 9.5 [[kiloton]]s and the second being test shot ''[[ET.317|Tendrac]]'' of [[Operation Storax]], which produced a yield cited as being "low" (under 20 kilotons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/publications/historical/DOENV_209_REV15.pdf |title=DOE/NV209 REV 15 December 2000 United States Nuclear Tests July 1945 through September 1992 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615231826/http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/publications/historical/DOENV_209_REV15.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another "reactor-grade" test, though not necessarily of the same US-UK 1962 design and plutonium-240 content, was the 1953 British [[Operation Totem]] series of nuclear tests. Despite producing a yield of 8-10 kilotons, from a Plutonium-239 content estimated at from 87-91%,&lt;ref name="aps.org"/&gt; something about the various tests displeased the British, for they never went through with their plan to weaponize Plutonium from magnox reactors at Calder Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theenergycollective.com/charlesbarton/28509/nuclear-proliferation-devices-and-weapons |title=Nuclear proliferation devices and weapons}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{reliable|date=September 2017}}

The initial codename for the Magnox reactor design amongst the government agency which mandated it, the [[UKAEA]], was the ''Pressurised Pile Producing Power and Plutonium(PIPPA)'' and as this codename suggests, the reactor was designed as both a power plant and, when operated with low fuel "burn-up"; as a producer of plutonium-239 for the nascent nuclear weapons program in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/appendices/nuclear-development-in-the-united-kingdom.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; This intentional dual-use approach to building electric power-reactors that could operate as production reactors in the early [[Cold War]] era, was typical of many nations, in the now designated, "[[Generation II reactor|Generation I nuclear reactors]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780857092380500048 4 Nuclear power plants: types, components and material requirements.

The [[2006 North Korean nuclear test]], the first by the DPRK, is also said to have had a magnox reactor as the root source of its plutonium, operated in [[Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center]] in North Korea.

In 2002 former Deputy Director General of the IAEA, Bruno Pelaud, stated that the DoE statement was misleading and that the test would have the modern definition of fuel-grade with a Pu-240 content of only 12%&lt;ref&gt;http://npolicy.org/books/Reactor-Grade_Plutonium_and_Nuclear_Weapons/Chapter_8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to political analyst [[Matthew Bunn]] and presidential technology advisor [[John Holdren]], both of the [[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs]], in 1997,  they cited an 1970s official U.S. assessment of programmatic alternatives for plutonium disposition. While it does not specify which RGPu definition is being referred to, it nonetheless states that "reactor-grade plutonium (with an unspecificed isotopic composition) can be used to produce nuclear weapons at all levels of technical sophistication," and "advanced nuclear weapon states such as the United States and Russia, using modern designs, could produce weapons from "reactor-grade plutonium" having reliable explosive yields, weight, and other characteristics generally comparable to those of weapons made from weapon-grade plutonium"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/files/publication/mmup.pdf Managing Military Uranium and Plutonium in the United States and the Former Soviet Union], Matthew Bunn and John P.

In a 2008 paper, Kessler et al. used a thermal analysis to conclude that a hypothetical nuclear explosive device was "technically unfeasible" using reactor grade plutonium from a reactor that had a burn up value of 30 GWd/t using "low technology" designs akin to [[Fat Man]] with spherical explosive lenses, or 55 GWd/t for "medium technology" designs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029549308004548?np=y Potential nuclear explosive yield of reactor-grade plutonium using the disassembly theory of early reactor safety analysis] doi.org/10.1016/j.nucengdes.2008.08.014&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Kessler et al. criteria, "high-technology" hypothetical nuclear explosive devices(HNEDs), that could be produced by the experienced [[nuclear weapons state]]s(NWSs) would be technically unfeasible with reactor-grade plutonium containing more than approximately 9% of the heat generating [[Pu-238]] isotope.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029549318300827 Proliferation resistant plutonium: An updated analysis doi.org/10.1016/j.nucengdes.2018.02.012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jaea.go.jp/04/np/activity/2011-02-22/2011-02-22-08.pdf A Consideration on Proliferation

==Typical isotopic composition of reactor grade plutonium==
The British Magnox reactor, a Generation I [[gas cooled reactor]](GCR) design, can rarely produce a fuel [[burnup]] of more than 2-5&amp;nbsp;[[kilowatt-hour|GWd]]/[[tonne|t]][[uranium|U]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2013/05/02/fancy-new-lids-for-nuclear-waste-casks-as-contents-get-hotter/ |title=Forbes magazine.

IAEA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Magnox reactor design was codenamed ''PIPPA'' (Pressurised Pile Producing Power and Plutonium) by the [[UKAEA]] to denote the plant's dual commercial ([[nuclear power|power reactor]]) and military ([[production reactor]]) role. The purity of Pu-239 from discharged magnox reactors is approximately 80%, depending on the burn up value.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120214232829/http://www.nda.gov.uk/documents/upload/Plutonium-Options-for-Comment-August-2008.pdf page 19, table 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, for example, a generic civilian [[Pressurized water reactor]]'s [[spent nuclear fuel]] isotopic composition, following a typical [[Generation II reactor]] 45&amp;nbsp;[[GigaWatt|GW]]d/tU of [[burnup]], is 1.11% plutonium, of which 0.56% is Pu-239, and 0.28% is Pu-240, which corresponds to a Pu-239 content of 50.5% and a Pu-240 content of 25.2%.&lt;ref&gt;http://info.ornl.gov/sites/publications/Files/Pub37993.pdf Categorization of Used Nuclear Fuel

Discharge isotopic composition of a WE 17×17 assembly with initial enrichment of 4.5 wt % that has accumulated 45&amp;nbsp;GWd/tU burnup/&lt;/ref&gt; For a lower generic burn-up rate of 43,000 [[Megawatt|MWd]]/t, as published in 1989, the plutonium-239 content was 53% of all plutonium isotopes in the reactor [[spent nuclear fuel]].&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/nuke/intro/nuke/plutonium.htm Source: Plutonium Fuel - OECD Report, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; 
The US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|NRC]] has stated that the commercial fleet of [[LWR]]s presently powering homes, had an average [[burnup]] of approximately 35 GWd/MTU in 1995, while in 2015, the average had improved to 45 GWd/MTU.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170226234425/https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/bg-high-burnup-spent-fuel.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The odd numbered fissile plutonium isotopes present in spent nuclear fuel, such as Pu-239, decrease significantly as a percentage of the total composition of all plutonium isotopes (which was 1.11% in the first example above) as higher and higher burnups take place, while the even numbered non-fissile plutonium isotopes (e.g. [[Pu-238]], [[Pu-240]] and [[Pu-242]]) increasingly accumulate in the fuel over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.ornl.gov/sites/publications/Files/Pub37993.pdf Categorization of Used Nuclear Fuel Inventory in Support of a Comprehensive National Nuclear Fuel Cycle Strategy. page 35 figure 21.

As power reactor technology increases, a goal is to reduce the spent nuclear fuel volume by increasing fuel efficiency and simultaneously reducing down times as much as possible to increase the economic viability of electricity generated from [[nuclear power plant|fission-electric stations]]. To this end, the reactors in the U.S. have doubled their average burn-up rates from 20-25 GWd/[[metric ton|MT]]U in the 1970s to over 45 GWd/[[metric ton|MT]]U in the 2000s.&lt;ref name="aesj.or.jp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2013/05/02/fancy-new-lids-for-nuclear-waste-casks-as-contents-get-hotter/ |title=Fancy New Lids for Nuclear Waste Casks, As Contents Get Hotter. "Status of Nuclear Power: A Global View IAEA 2005.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Generation III reactor]]s under construction have a designed-for [[burnup]] rate in the 60&amp;nbsp;GWd/tU range and a need to refuel once every 2 years or so.

Uploaded by - Nuclear Engineering at Argonne}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As opposed to the standard practice worldwide of [[PUREX]] separation, plutonium is not separated on its own in this pilot-scale, reprocessing cycle, rather all [[actinides]] are "[[electrowinning|electro-won]]" or "refined" from the "true waste" of [[fission products]] in spent fuel. The plutonium therefore instead comes over mixed with all the [[MOX_fuel#Americium_content|gamma and alpha emitting actinides]], species that "self-protect" in numerous possible theft scenarios.

Today's moderated/''[[thermal reactor]]s'' primarily run on the [[Nuclear_fuel_cycle#Once-through_nuclear_fuel_cycle|once-thru fuel cycle]] though they can reuse once-thru reactor-grade plutonium to a limited degree in the form of mixed-oxide or [[MOX fuel]], which is a routine commercial practice in most countries outside the US as it increases the sustainability of nuclear fission and lowers the volume of high level nuclear waste.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544214002035?np=y Assessment of the environmental footprint of nuclear energy systems.

One third of the energy/fissions at the ''end'' of the practical fuel life in a thermal reactor are from plutonium, the end of cycle occurs when the [[U-235]] percentage drops, the primary fuel that drives the [[neutron economy]] inside the reactor and the drop necessitates fresh fuel being required, so without design change, one third of the fissile fuel in a ''new'' fuel load can be fissile reactor-grade plutonium with one third less of [[Low enriched uranium]] needing to be added to continue the chain reactions anew, thus achieving a partial recycling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.physics.harvard.edu/~wilson/publications/ppaper643.html ''Plutonium Burning for Disposal of Pure Plutonium'', Richard Wilson Harvard University.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A typical 5.3% reactor-grade plutonium MOX fuel bundle, is [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutated]] when it itself is again burnt, a practice that is typical in French ''thermal'' reactors, to a twice-thru reactor-grade plutonium, with an isotopic composition of 40.8% Pu-239 and 30.6% Pu-240 at the end of cycle (EOC).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd-nea.org/pt/docs/1999/neastatus99/AnnexE.pdf See table B "MOX fuels".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name="external"&gt;with the rest being 14.9% Pu-241, 10.6% Pu-242 and 3.1% Pu-238&lt;/ref&gt; "'''MOX grade plutonium(MGPu)'''" is generally defined as having more than 30% Pu-240.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170711002254/http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/publications/Pages/the-categorisation-of-nuclear-material-in-the-context-of-integrated-safeguards.aspx The categorisation of nuclear material in the context of integrated safeguards]&lt;/ref&gt;

A limitation in the number of recycles exists within [[thermal reactor]]s, as opposed to the situation in fast reactors, as in the [[thermal neutron]] spectrum only the odd-mass [[isotopes of plutonium]] are [[fissile]], the even-mass isotopes thus accumulate, in all high thermal-spectrum burnup scenarios. [[Plutonium-240]], an even-mass isotope is, within the thermal neutron spectrum, a [[fertile material]] like [[uranium-238]], becoming fissile [[plutonium-241]] on neutron capture; however, the even-mass [[plutonium-242]] not only has a low [[neutron capture]] [[Neutron cross-section|cross section]] within the thermal spectrum, it also requires 3 [[neutron capture]]s before becoming a fissile nuclide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.physics.harvard.edu/~wilson/publications/ppaper643.html ''Plutonium Burning for Disposal of Pure Plutonium'', Richard Wilson Harvard University.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

While most thermal neutron reactors must limit MOX fuel to less than half of the total fuel load for nuclear stability reasons, due to the reactor design operating within the limitations of a thermal spectrum of neutrons, [[Fast neutron reactor]]s on the other hand can use plutonium of any isotopic composition, operate on completely recycled plutonium and in the fast "[[burner reactor|burner]]" mode, or fuel cycle, fission and thereby eliminate all the plutonium present in the world stockpile of once-thru spent fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781782422129000095?np=y 9 – Reprocessing of spent fast reactor nuclear fuels.

In Bathke's equation on "attractiveness level" of [[Weapons-grade nuclear material]], the Figure of Merit(FOM) the calculation generates, returns the suggestion that Sodium Fast Breeder Reactors are unlikely to reach the desired level of proliferation resistance, while Molten Salt breeder reactors are more likely to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jaea.go.jp/04/np/activity/2011-02-22/2011-02-22-08.pdf A Consideration on Proliferation

As is typically found in civilian European ''thermal'' reactors, a 5.3% plutonium MOX fuel-bundle,  produced by conventional wet-chemical/PUREX [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] of an initial fuel assembly that generated 33 GWd/t before becoming [[spent nuclear fuel]], creates, when it itself is burnt in the ''thermal'' reactor, a [[spent nuclear fuel]] with a plutonium isotopic composition of 40.8% Pu-239 and 30.6% Pu-240.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd-nea.org/pt/docs/1999/neastatus99/AnnexE.pdf See table B "MOX fuels".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name="external"&gt;with the rest being 14.9% Pu-241, 10.6% Pu-242 and 3.1% Pu-238&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nuclear reprocessing|Reprocessing]], which mainly takes the form of recycling reactor-grade plutonium back into the same or a more advanced fleet of reactors, was planned in the US in the 1960s. At that time the [[uranium market]] was anticipated to become crowded and supplies tight so together with recycling fuel, the more efficient [[fast breeder reactor]]s were thereby seen as immediately needed to efficiently use the limited known uranium supplies. This became less urgent as time passed, with both reduced demand forecasts and increased uranium ore discoveries, for these economic reasons, fresh fuel and the reliance on solely fresh fuel remained cheaper in commercial terms than recycled. 

In 1977 the Carter administration placed a ban on reprocessing spent fuel, in an effort to set an international example, as within the US, there is the perception that it would lead to nuclear weapons proliferation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/10/01/why-doesnt-u-s-recycle-nuclear-fuel/#409b354a390f Why Doesn't U.S. Recycle Nuclear Fuel?]&lt;/ref&gt; This decision has remained controversial and is viewed by many US physicists and engineers as fundamentally in error, having cost the US taxpayer and [[Nuclear_Waste_Policy_Act#Payment_of_costs|the fund generated by US reactor utility operators]], with cancelled programs and the over 1 billion dollar investment into the proposed alternative, that of [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]] ending in protests, lawsuits and repeated stop-and-go decisions depending on the opinions of new incoming presidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.physics.harvard.edu/~wilson/publications/ppaper643.html ''Plutonium Burning for Disposal of Pure Plutonium'', Richard Wilson

"Using the European or Japanese reactors for burning plutonium, while the quickest means of accomplishing the task of burning weapons plutonium, would send a signal (undesired by this group of people) that the European and Japanese approach (which more closely resembles the Eisenhower approach than the Carter one) has merit. But the converse could also be true. A refusal to ask the rest of the world to help in burning plutonium can be, and in some quarters is taken as a signal that the United States is not serious about destroying weapons stocks.

As the "undesirable" contaminant from a weapons manufacturing viewpoint, Pu-240, decays faster than the Pu-239, with half lives of 6500 and 24,000 years respectively, the quality of the plutonium grade, increases with time (although its total quantity decreases during that time as well). Thus, physicists and engineers have pointed out, as hundreds/thousands of years pass, the alternative to fast reactor "burning"  or recycling of the plutonium from the world fleet of reactors until it is all burnt up, the alternative to burning most frequently proposed, that of deep [[geological repository]], such as [[Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository]], have the potential to become "plutonium mines", from which ''weapons-grade'' material for nuclear weapons could be acquired by simple [[PUREX]] extraction, in the centuries-to-millenia to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nci.org/s/sp121495.htm |title=A Perspective on the Proliferation Risks of Plutonium Mines |author=Lyman, Edwin S. |publisher=[[Nuclear Control Institute]] |date=December 1994 |accessdate=2015-11-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125225922/http://nci.org/s/sp121495.htm |archivedate=2015-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://npolicy.org/books/Reactor-Grade_Plutonium_and_Nuclear_Weapons/Chapter_3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robin Wood''' is a [[Germany|German]] [[Environmental movement|environmental advocacy]] group. The group was founded in 1982 by former members of [[Greenpeace]] who desired a decentralized [[grassroots]] organization with greater autonomy to address specific local German issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Neil | last=Carter | title=The Politics of the Environment: Ideas, Activism, Policy | page=155 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | edition=2 |date=May 2007 | ISBN=0-521-86802-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Robin Wood is based in [[Bremen]] and, in 2008, was composed of fifteen mostly autonomous regional groups within Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Sonia | last=Gigler | title= Robin Wood: Germany's Bare Branch Avenger | url=http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/article/24137/robin-wood-germanys-bare-branch-avenger.html | newspaper=Cafe Babel | date=11 March 2008 | accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''royal funeral chariot''' is a wheeled vehicle traditionally used to transport the bodies of royalty during [[funeral procession]]s in some cultures of [[Mainland Southeast Asia]]. Today, they remain in use in [[Thailand]] and [[Cambodia]].

==Thailand==
The royal funeral chariots of Thailand were used since the Ayutthaya period, but they were destroyed when Ayutthaya was completely sacked in 1767. New funeral chariots were commissioned during the reign of King [[Rama I]] at the beginning of the [[Rattanakosin period]]. They include, among other smaller accompanying vehicles, the two main chariots which have been used to transport the bodies of kings of the [[Chakri Dynasty]], the Maha Phichai Ratcharot ("Royal Great Victory Carriage" or "Royal Chariot of Great Victory"), built in 1795, and Vejayanta Ratcharot (Named after [[Indra]]'s chariot Vejayanta), built in 1799. The chariots, built of teak and ornately carved, gilded and decorated, have a tall, tiered design symbolizing [[Mount Meru]] surrounded by ''[[devata]]'' (angels) and ''[[nāga]]''. The chariots are topped with a ''butsabok'' (open-sided roofed structure) which houses the royal funerary urn containing the royal body. Despite the term used, the "chariots" have four wheels and are pulled by hundreds of men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Srimaneekulroj|first1=Kanin|title=Carrying the weight of history|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/lifestyle/social-and-lifestyle/1131529/carrying-the-weight-of-history|accessdate=12 November 2016|work=Bangkok Post|date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ราชรถราชยานของไทย|url=http://www.virtualmuseum.finearts.go.th/bangkoknationalmuseums/index.php/th/2015-03-19-11-02-16/%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%AD-video/68-%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%96%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A2.html|website=Virtual Museum website|publisher=Department of Fine Arts|accessdate=12 November 2016|language=Thai|format=video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maha Phichai Ratcharot was used for the funeral procession of King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] in October 2017. It was drawn by 216 men. The 13.7 [[tonne]] chariot is 18 metres long, 11.2 metres high, and 4.8 metres wide. It has been used 25 times, most recently in 2012 for the cremation of Princess [[Bejaratana|Bejaratana Rajasuda]], the late king's cousin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Skulpichetrat|first1=Jutarat|title=Golden chariot restored for Thai king's "ascent to heaven"|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-king-idUSKBN15M0GQ|accessdate=7 February 2017|agency=Reuters|date=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The royal chariots are housed in the [[Bangkok National Museum]] and undergo restoration when they are needed for royal funerals. Following custom, The doorsill of the exhibition hall and a section of the museum wall are demolished and a path is laid each time the chariots need to be brought outside. Then the structures are rebuilt and the path removed after the ceremony ends, signifying that their future use is not anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=“พระมหาพิชัยราชรถ” เสร็จพิธีก่อกำแพง-รื้อถนนปิดตาย|url=http://www.springnews.co.th/program/news/scoop/325705|accessdate=12 November 2016|work=Spring News|date=30 October 2016|language=Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional chariot, the Rajarot Puen Yai (''royal gun carriage''), is used only for the cremations of the King in his constitutional duty as [[Head of the Royal Thai Armed Forces]] (a tradition started by  King Vajiravudh on his request to recognize the royal patronage and support for the armed services of the Kingdom, used for the first time in his state cremation in 1926)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Royal Cremation to feature gun-carriage procession for first time in 67 years |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/national/30328574|date=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the urn carrying his remains is carried in procession around the royal crematorium at the Sanam Luang Royal Plaza thrice before the cremation services begin. The carriage is modeled on those used in the royal and state funerals in the United Kingdom, and was restored yet again in 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1481">The '''saturation vapor curve''' is the curve separating the two-phase state and the superheated &lt;!-- where "superheated" means "the number of degrees a vapor is above its saturation temperature", not "the metastable state of a liquid above its saturation temperature" --&gt; vapor state in the [[T-s diagram]].

When used in a [[Thermodynamic cycle|power cycle]], the fluid expansion depends strongly on the nature of this saturation curve:

* A "wet" fluid shows a negative saturation vapor curve.  If overheating before the expansion is limited, a two-phase state is obtained at the end of the expansion.
[[Image:Wet_fluid.png|350px|Wet fluid in an ORC cycle]]
* An "[[isentropic]]" fluid shows a vertical saturation vapor curve. It remains very close to the saturated vapor state after an hypothetical isentropic expansion.
[[Image:Isentropic_fluid.png|350px|Isentropic fluid in an ORC cycle]]
* A "dry" fluid shows a positive saturation vapor curve. It is in dry vapor state at the end of the expansion, and strongly overheated.

The '''shrouded tidal turbine''' is an emerging [[Tidal stream generator|tidal stream technology]] that has a turbine enclosed in a [[Venturi effect|venturi]] shaped [[shroud]] or duct (ventuduct), producing a sub atmosphere of low pressure behind the turbine. The venturi shrouded turbine is not subject to the [[Betz limit]] and allows the turbine to operate at higher efficiencies than the turbine alone by increasing the volume of the flow over the turbine. Claimed improvements vary, from 1.15 to 4 times higher power output &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberiad.net/library/pdf/bk_tidal_paper25apr06.pdf |title=Brian Kirke's published article Developments in Ducted Water Turbines |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913202219/http://www.cyberiad.net/library/pdf/bk_tidal_paper25apr06.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; than the same turbine minus the shroud. The Betz limit of 59.3% conversion efficiency for a turbine in an open flow still applies, but is applied to the much larger shroud cross-section rather than the small turbine cross-section.

==Principles==

Considerable commercial interest has been shown in shrouded tidal stream turbines due to the increased power output. They can operate in shallower slower moving water with a smaller turbine at sites where large turbines are restricted. Arrayed across a seaway or in fast flowing rivers, shrouded turbines are cabled to shore for connection to a grid or a community. Alternatively the property of the shroud that produces an accelerated flow velocity across the turbine allows tidal flows formerly too slow for commercial use to be used for energy production.

While the shroud may not be practical in wind, as the next generation of tidal stream turbine design it is gaining more popularity and commercial use. The Tidal Energy Pty Ltd tidal turbine is multidirectional able to face up-stream in any direction and the Lunar Energy turbine bi directional. All tidal stream turbines constantly need to face at the correct angle to the water stream in order to operate. The Tidal Energy Pty Ltd is a unique case with a pivoting base. Lunar Energy use a wide angle diffuser to capture incoming flow that may not be inline with the long axis of the turbine. A shroud can also be built into a tidal fence or barrage increasing the performance of turbines.

==Types of shroud==

Not all shrouded turbines are the same - the performance of a shrouded turbine varies with the design of the shroud. Not all shrouded turbines have undergone independent scrutiny of claimed performances, as companies closely guard their respective technologies, so quoted performance figures need to be closely scrutinised.  Lunar Energy reports a 15%-25%  improvement over the same turbine without the shroud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lunarenergy.co.uk/duct.htm |title=Lunar Energy |publisher=Lunar Energy |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shrouded turbines do not operate at maximum efficiency when the shroud does not intercept the current flow at the correct angle, which can occur as currents eddy and swirl, resulting in reduced operational efficiency. At lower turbine efficiencies the extra cost of the shroud must be justified, while at higher efficiencies the extra cost of the shroud has less impact on commercial returns. Similarly the added cost of the supporting structure for the shroud has to be balanced against the performance gained. Yawing (pivoting) the shroud and turbine at the correct angle, so it always faces upstream like a wind sock, can increase turbine performance but may need expensive active devices to turn the shroud into the flow. Passive designs can be incorporated, such as floating the shrouded turbine under a pontoon on a swing mooring, or flying the turbine like a kite under water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uekus.com |title=Underwater Electric Kite |publisher=Uekus.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; One design by Tidal Energy Pty Ltd passively yaws the shrouded turbine using a turntable with a peer reviewed claim of 3.84 (384%) increase in efficiency over the same turbine minus the shroud - See Kirke..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tidalenergy.net.au |title=Tidal energy Pty. Ltd |publisher=Tidalenergy.net.au |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Advantages ===
* A shroud of suitable geometry can increase the flow velocity across the turbine by 3 to 4 times the open or free stream velocity.
* More power generated means greater returns on investment.
* The number of suitable sites is increased as sites formerly too slow for commercial development become viable.
* Where large cumbersome turbines are not suitable, smaller shrouded turbines can be sea-bed-mounted in shallow rivers and estuaries allowing safe navigation of the water ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verdantpower.com/what-initiative |title=Verdant Power |publisher=Verdant Power |date=2012-01-23 |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hidden in a shroud, a turbine is less likely to be damaged by floating debris.
* Bio-fouling is also reduced as the turbine is shaded from natural light in shallow water.
* The increased velocities through the turbine effectively water-blast the shroud throat and turbine clean as organisms are unable to attach at increased velocities. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberiad.net/library/pdf/bk_tidal_paper25apr06.pdf |title=Brian Kirke's PhD Thesis |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913202219/http://www.cyberiad.net/library/pdf/bk_tidal_paper25apr06.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Described by one manufacturer as 'eco-benign',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tidalenergy.net.au/index-subpage-2.html |title=What is hydro kinetic energy? |publisher=Tidal Energy Pty Ltd |accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; tidal stream turbines do not interfere with marine life or the environment and have little or no visual amenity impact.

=== Disadvantages ===
* Most shrouded turbines are directional, although one exception is the version off Southern Vancouver Island in British Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Garry Fletcher |url=http://www.racerocks.com/racerock/energy/tidalenergy/tidalenergy.htm |title=deployed at Race Rocks |publisher=Racerocks.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; One-direction fixed shrouds may not capture flow efficiently - in order for the shroud to produce maximum efficiency to use both flood and ebb tide they need to be yawed like a windmill on a pivot or turntable, or suspended under a pontoon on a marine swing mooring allowing the turbine to always face upstream like a wind sock.
* Shrouded turbine loads are 3 to 4 times those of the open or free stream turbine, so a robust mounting system is necessary. However, this mounting system needs to be designed in such a way as to prevent turbulence being spilled onto the turbine or high-pressure waves occurring near the turbine and detuning performance. Streamlining the mounts and or including structural mounts in the shroud geometry performs two functions, that of supporting the turbine and providing a net benefit of 3 to 4 times the power output.

For example, it can be produced as a settled suspension obtained from conventional drinking water treatment, as [[sewage sludge]] from wastewater treatment processes or as [[Fecal sludge management|fecal sludge]] from [[Pit latrine|pit latrines]] and [[Septic tank|septic tanks]]. The term is also sometimes used as a generic term for solids separated from suspension in a liquid; this 'soupy' material usually contains significant quantities of 'interstitial' water (between the solid particles).

[[Industrial wastewater treatment]] plants produce solids that are also referred to as sludge. This can be generated from biological or physical-chemical processes.

In the [[Activated sludge|activated sludge process]] for wastewater treatment, the terms "waste activated sludge" and "return activated sludge" are used.

More and more research is being put into '''Solar-wind hybrid turbines''', since predicting either wind or sun can be difficult. Many different designs are being tested to determine if there is an efficient way to combine the two. Installing [[solar panel]]s on the already existing [[wind turbine]]s was tested, but produced blinding rays of light that posed a threat to [[airplane]]s. These beams also had the potential to cause fires if concentrated. The solution to this was produce tinted solar panels that do not reflect as much light. Another proposed design was to have a [[vertical axis wind turbine]] coated in solar cells that are able to absorb sunlight from any angle. While these designs are still being tested, scientists are having success, and these new hybrid units are a very promising project.&lt;ref&gt;Jha, A. R. Wind Turbine Technology.

The use of '''solar energy in rural areas across sub-Saharan Africa''' has increased over the years. With many communities lacking access to basic necessities such as [[electricity]], [[clean water]], and effective [[irrigation]] systems; the innovations in solar powered technologies have led to poverty alleviation projects that combine development strategies and environmental consciousness. Another use for [[solar energy]] that has gained momentum in rural African households (as well as some urban areas) is that of [[solar cooking]]. Historically, the high dependency on wood collection from depleting sources have resulted in serious environmental degradation and has been considered an extremely unsustainable practice when compared to the renewable attribute of solar powered cooking. There have also been recent links made between solar energy and increased [[food security]] in the region. African development projects, mostly in rural areas seem to be recognizing the real potential of [[renewable energy]] sources especially power derived from the sun.

==Solar cooking==
The article by Hilde M. Toonen (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toonen|first=Hilde M.|title=Adapting to an innovation: Solar cooking in the urban households of Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso)|journal=Physics and Chemistry of the Earth|date=2009|volume=34|pages=65–71|doi=10.1016/j.pce.2008.03.006|bibcode=2009PCE....34...65T}}&lt;!--|accessdate=Jan 31, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; details the efforts carried out by the SUPO (Stichting voor Urbane Projecten in Ontwikkelingslanden) foundation that was established in 1977; when they began a solar cooking project in 2005 in the urban households of the [[Burkina Faso]] city of [[Ouagadougou]]: PESGO (Programme Energie Solaire Grand-Ouaga). The technology used was that of [[CooKit]] which is a cardboard panel cooker covered with aluminum foil. Sunrays are reflected towards a black pot which is placed in a thermo-resistant plastic bag. Temperatures from 70 _C to 90_C (160 F and 200 F) can be reached. The cardboard is foldable and weighs only 500 g (1&amp;nbsp;lb.), it is therefore easily stored. If the CooKit is kept dry and away from [[termite]]s, the CooKit may last for several years. Considering its durability, the CooKit seems to be a good investment: the purchase costs are lower than the money people spend on firewood. The manufacturing of the CooKit is not difficult. Solar Cookers International published a construction manual (SCI, 2007c). A CooKit can be made in one or two hours and materials needed are cardboard, aluminum foil and non-toxic, water based glue (SCI, 2007c) (see Fig. 1). (Toonen, 2009).

Fig. 1 The CooKit

As mentioned above the [[CooKit]] aims to reduce the high dependency on firewood and [[charcoal]] for cooking purposes that proves to not only negatively affect the environment; but also put a strain on the finances of the individual households. However the researchers involved in the SUPO foundation quickly realized that CooKit alone could not be as effective in replacing firewood; and that the use of a special plant oil extracted from the drought-resistant [[Jatropha]] plant would be the most complementary component to aid in the cooking process as a fuel substitute. The process of extraction is also very straightforward where an individual just needs to squeeze the plant to get the oil. According to SUPA the main reason for using [[Jatropha oil]] along with the CooKit is due to the unreliability of weather conditions; however there have not yet been any developments in creating an inexpensive stove to be used with the Jatropha oil but that a one-flame cooker is simply a [[prototype]] at this stage.
The CooKit example shared here is only one adaptation to solar cooking technology and that further research reveals other innovations such as the Solar Fryer (Gallagher, 2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gallagher|first=Alan|title=A Solar Fryer|journal=Solar Energy|date=2011|volume=85|pages=496–505|doi=10.1016/j.solener.2010.12.018|bibcode=2011SoEn...85..496G}}&lt;!--|accessdate=Jan 31, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the original [[Solar box cooker|Solar Box Oven]]. Evidence has shown that although the main setbacks to solar cooking are the longer time it takes to prepare meals for families and that the dependency on favorable weather conditions means that one cannot use solar energy every day; it is a step in the right direction as it can at least alleviate the pressure currently being placed on the remaining scarce firewood resources.

==Solar-powered water purification==
[[Water purification|Purified water]] is a big issue facing many communities in the [[Developing country|developing world]] in particular. Those in rural areas are usually too isolated for on-grid government-funded water pipe infrastructure to be built; and so the responsibility of getting clean water becomes that of the women and their children in the villages who have to walk long distances to water sources that are not necessarily the purest.

In the article by Sambwa et al. (2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sambwa|first=Adoko|author2=Nwokoye D. Nnamdi|author3=Umeghalu S. Ebelechukwu|last-author-amp=yes|title=Recycling of used DC motors as solar pumps for water supply and water delivery applications in urban poor and rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa|journal=Desalination|date=2009|volume=248|pages=586–594|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2008.05.106}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authors highlight these issues and propose the integration of DC (Direct Current) Motors into solar powered water pumping technology. This is usually referred to as ‘[[Technology transfer|Technology Transfer]]’ that the authors argue is a development concept, [that has been] conceived by the politicians and the general public in sub-Saharan Africa as the ability to purchase or acquire technological equipment. Coupled with ‘‘globalization and economic liberation’’, this trend has become contagious to the point that any segment of unserviceable technological equipment finds its way into the sub-region…They are grouped as: vehicles, house hold machinery, industrial equipment, and many more. The authors have identified these unserviceable equipment as an inestimable source of [[raw material]]s where DC motors have been extracted (recovered) for the purpose of being reconfigured as DC motors for driving water pumps. (Sambwa et al., 2009). The pump itself can be retrieved from washing machines or radiators of the generating set engines. Figure 2 below shows the end product of the DC Motor Drive Water Pump before it has been connected to the [[solar panel]]s.

Fig. 2 DC motor drive water pump

However one of the main setbacks of relying on used imported technologies is that they prove to be problematic to local engineers and technicians as most of them have already worked for many years before being exported to the continent. (Sambwa et al., 2009).
The project proved to be successful as it was able to pump water from a 10m deep water reservoir; but in order to fund future projects costs would have to be covered by external sources. In spite of the higher production costs, the overall benefit of utilizing this technology outweighs the proposed setbacks. And due to the relatively simplistic model, maintenance work that would arise in the future can be dealt with by the local technicians.

==Solar-powered drip irrigation system==
In the article by Burney et al. (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burney|first=Jennifer|author2=Lennart Woltering |author3=Marshall Burke |author4=Rosamond Naylor |author5=Dov Pasternak |title=Solar-powered drip irrigation enhances food security in the Sudano–Sahel|journal=PNAS|date=2 Feb 2010|volume=107|issue=5|pages=1848–1853|doi=10.1073/pnas.0909678107 |pmid=20080616 |pmc=2806882|bibcode=2010PNAS..107.1848B|url=http://oar.icrisat.org/2273/1/PNAS107_5_1848-1853_2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; another use for solar energy that has been proposed is the Photovoltaic- (or solar-) powered drip irrigation (PVDI) system [which] combines the efficiency of [[drip irrigation]] with the reliability of a solar-powered water pump… [Where the] PV array powers a pump (either surface or submersible, depending on the water source) that feeds water to a reservoir. The reservoir then gravity-distributes the water to a low-pressure drip irrigation system. No batteries are used in the system: The pump only runs during the daytime, and energy storage is in the height of the column of water in the reservoir.
An important technological advancement for agricultural practices in the region that is related to increasing food security; the PVDI systems were integrated into preexisting local women’s agricultural groups in the Kalalé District of Northern [[Benin]] in November 2007. The PVDI systems were conceived, financed, and installed by an NGO, the Solar Electric Light Fund,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.self.org Solar Electric Light Fund: Energy is a Human Right&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; to boost vegetable production from communal gardens in an effort to combat high malnutrition and poverty levels in the region. (Burney et al., 2010).

Wooden toy-making is a traditional craft in the [[Varanasi]] district of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]. Bright and colourful lacquered toys are made by clusters of skilled craftsmen. These toys were given the [[Geographical Indication]] tag in 2014, along with other lacquer ware produced in this region.&lt;ref name="gijournal"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Varanasi Wooden Lacquerware &amp; Toys - GI Application 457|journal=Geographical Indications Journal|date=28 November 2014|volume=64|pages=15–21|url=http://www.ipindia.nic.in/writereaddata/Portal/IPOJournal/1_70_1/gi-journal-64.pdf|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
According to the craftsmen, their ancestors specialised in ivory carving that enjoyed good patronage during the reign of the Mughal emperors and the British. After ivory was banned by the Government of India, they shifted to woodcarving.&lt;ref name="deccan herald"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wooden wonders of Varanasi|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/559720/wooden-wonders-varanasi.html|accessdate=23 November 2016|work=Deccan Herald|publisher=The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.|date=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process of manufacture ==
Wooden logs are sourced from nearby areas such as the jungles of Chitrakoot and Sonbhadra.&lt;ref name="deccan herald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dna"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wooden toy manufacturing industry on the verge of dying|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/locality/varanasi/wooden-toy-manufacturing-industry-verge-dying-38491|accessdate=23 November 2016|work=Daily News and Analysis (DNA)|publisher=Diligent Media Corporation Ltd.|date=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keria (Coraiya) wood from Bihar was used earlier and it is still the preferred type of wood for toy-making. But after the government banned the cutting of Keria trees in the 1980s, the craftsmen switched to using the wood from [[eucalyptus]], which is now used predominantly.&lt;ref name="dna"/&gt; Stacks of wooden logs can be seen stored outside the houses of the wood-carvers.&lt;ref name="dsource"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Visen|first1=Shivani|title=Wooden Toys of Varanasi - The Craft of Wooden Toy Making|url=http://www.dsource.in/resource/wooden-toys-varanasi|website=D'source Digital Online Learning Environment for Design|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pieces of wood are cut out from the logs according to the size of the toy that is to be made. Each piece is heated slowly to remove all the moisture from the wood. This process is time-consuming.&lt;ref name="deccan herald"/&gt; The piece is sanded in order to smoothen its surface.&lt;ref name="dsource" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gijournal" /&gt;

The wood is either hand-carved or shaped using [[lathe]]. Lathe is preferred for toys that are axially symmetric. In hand-carving, first the design of the toy is drawn on the wood. Then, the wood is sculpted with chisel and hammer according to the design. Once shaped, the surface of the toy is smoothened using a file and the toy is sent for painting.&lt;ref name="dsource" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gijournal" /&gt;

Toys are given several coats of paint, and finished with a clear or coloured lacquer. Paint brushes made out of the hair from squirrel’s tail are used for painting fine lines.&lt;ref name="dsource"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deccan herald" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gijournal"/&gt;

Lacquering may also be done on a lathe. For slender and delicate items, hand-lathe is preferred. A lac stick is pressed against the toy which is fixed to the lathe. While the toy keeps revolving, the heat generated by friction softens the lac, making it stick to the toy.&lt;ref name="dsource"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gijournal"/&gt;

== Geographical Indication Tag ==
Artisan groups from the region applied for the GI tag in September 2013 and their request was granted in November 2014.&lt;ref name="gijournal"/&gt;
