(2003). Behavioral game theory: Experiments in strategic interaction. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Behavioral game theory began with the work of Allais in 1953 and Ellsberg in 1961.  They discovered the [[Allais paradox]] and the [[Ellsberg paradox]], respectively.&lt;ref name="Gintis"&gt;Gintis, H. (2005). Behavioral game theory and contemporary economic theory. Analyse &amp; Kritik, 27(1), 48-72.&lt;/ref&gt; Both paradoxes show that choices made by participants in a game do not reflect the benefit they expect to receive from making those choices.  In the 1970s the work of Vernon Smith showed that economic markets could be examined experimentally rather than only theoretically.&lt;ref name="Gintis"/&gt;  At the same time, several economists conducted experiments that discovered variations of traditional decision-making models such as [[regret (decision theory)|regret theory]], [[prospect theory]], and [[hyperbolic discounting]].&lt;ref name="Gintis"/&gt; These discoveries showed that actual decision makers consider many factors when making choices. For example, a person may seek to minimize the amount of regret they will feel after making a decision and weigh their options based on the amount of regret they anticipate from each. Because they were not previously examined by traditional economic theory, factors such as regret along with many others fueled further research.

Beginning in the 1980s experimenters started examining the conditions that cause divergence from [[rational choice theory|rational choice]]. [[ultimatum game|Ultimatum]] and [[bargaining problem#the bargaining game|bargaining games]] examined the effect of emotions on predictions of opponent behavior.  One of the most well known examples of an ultimatum game is the television show [[Deal or No Deal]] in which participants must make decisions to sell or continue playing based on monetary ultimatums given to them by “the banker.” These games also explored the effect of trust on decision-making outcomes and utility maximizing behavior.&lt;ref name="Gintis2"&gt;Gintis, H. (2009). The bounds of reason: Game theory and the unification of the behavioral sciences. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Common resource games were used to experimentally test how cooperation and social desirability affect subject's choices. A real life example of a common resource game might be a party guest's decision to take from a food platter. The guests decisions would not only be affected by how hungry they are, but they would also be affected by how much of the shared resource, the food, is left and if the guest believes others would judge them for taking more. Experimenters during this period regarded behavior that did not maximize utility as the result of participant's flawed reasoning.&lt;ref name="Gintis"/&gt; By the turn of the century economists and psychologists expanded this research. Models based on the [[rational choice theory]] were adapted to reflect decision maker preferences and attempt to rationalize choices that did not maximize utility.&lt;ref name="Gintis"/&gt;

== Comparison to traditional game theory ==
Traditional game theory uses theoretical models to determine the most beneficial choice of all players in a game.&lt;ref name="Osborne"&gt;Osborne, M. J., &amp; Rubinstein, A. (1994). A course in game theory. MIT press.&lt;/ref&gt; Game theory uses rational choice theory along with assumptions of players' common knowledge in order to predict utility-maximizing decisions.&lt;ref name="Osborne"/&gt; It also allows for players to predict their opponents' strategies.&lt;ref name="Colman"&gt;Colman, A. M. (2003). Cooperation, psychological game theory, and limitations of rationality in social interaction. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 26(02), 139-153.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional game theory is a primarily [[Normative economics|normative theory]] as it seeks to pinpoint the decision rational players should choose, but does not attempt to explain why that decision was made.&lt;ref name="Colman"/&gt; Rationality is a primary assumption of game theory, so there are not explanations for different forms of rational decisions or irrational decisions.&lt;ref name="Colman"/&gt;

Behavioral game theory is a primarily [[Positive economics|positive theory]] rather than a normative theory.&lt;ref name="Colman"/&gt; A positive theory seeks to describe phenomena rather than prescribe a correct action. Positive theories must be testable and can be proven true or false. A normative theory is subjective and based on opinions. Because of this, normative theories cannot be proven true or false. Behavioral game theory attempts to explain decision making using experimental data.&lt;ref name="Colman"/&gt; The theory allows for rational and irrational decisions because both are examined using real-life experiments. Specifically, behavioral game theory attempts to explain factors that influence real world decisions.&lt;ref name="Colman"/&gt; These factors are not explored in the area of traditional game theory, but can be postulated and observed using empirical data.&lt;ref name="Colman"/&gt; Findings from behavioral game theory will tend to have higher [[external validity]] and can be better applied to real world decision-making behavior.&lt;ref name="Colman"/&gt;

== Factors that affect rationality in games ==

=== Beliefs ===
Beliefs about other people in a decision-making game are expected to influence ones ability to make rational choices. However, beliefs of others can also cause experimental results to deviate from equilibrium, utility-maximizing decisions. In an experiment by Costa-Gomez (2008) participants were questioned about their first order beliefs about their opponent's actions prior to completing a series of normal-form games with other participants.&lt;ref name="belief"&gt;Costa-Gomes, M. A., &amp; Weizsäcker, G. (2008). Stated beliefs and play in normal-form games. The Review of Economic Studies, 75(3), 729-762.&lt;/ref&gt; Participants complied with Nash Equilibrium only 35% of the time. Further, participants only stated beliefs that their opponents would comply with traditional game theory equilibrium 15% of the time.&lt;ref name="belief"/&gt; This means participants believed their opponents would be less rational than they really were. The results of this study show that participants do not choose the utility-maximizing action and they expect their opponents to do the same.&lt;ref name="belief"/&gt; Also, the results show that participants did not choose the utility-maximizing action that corresponded to their beliefs about their opponent's action.&lt;ref name="belief"/&gt; While participants may have believed their opponent was more likely to make a certain decision, they still made decisions as if their opponent was choosing randomly.&lt;ref name="belief"/&gt; Another study that examined participants from the TV show Deal or No Deal found divergence from rational choice.&lt;ref name="post"&gt;Post, T., Van den Assem, M. J., Baltussen, G., &amp; Thaler, R. H. (2008). Deal or no deal? Decision making under risk in a large-payoff game show. The American economic review, 38-71.&lt;/ref&gt; Participants were more likely to base their decisions on previous outcomes when progressing through the game.&lt;ref name="post"/&gt; [[Risk aversion]] decreased when participants' expectations were not met within the game. For example a subject that experienced a string of positive outcomes was less likely to accept the deal and end the game. The same was true for a subject that experienced primarily negative outcomes early in the game.&lt;ref name="post"/&gt;

=== Social cooperation ===
Social behavior and cooperation with other participants are two factors that are not modeled in traditional game theory, but are often seen in an experimental setting.  The evolution of social norms has been neglected in decision-making models, but these norms influence the ways in which real people interact with one another and make choices.&lt;ref name="Gintis2"/&gt; One tendency is for a person to be a strong reciprocator.&lt;ref name="Gintis2"/&gt; This type of person enters a game with the predisposition to cooperate with other players. They will increase their cooperation levels in response to cooperation from other players and decrease their cooperation levels, even at their own expense, to punish players who do not cooperate.&lt;ref name="Gintis2"/&gt; This is not utility-maximizing behavior, as a strong reciprocator is willing to reduce their payoff in order to encourage cooperation from others.&lt;br /&gt;
 
Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger (2004) developed a model based on reciprocity called the sequential reciprocity equilibrium. This model adapts traditional game theory logic to the idea that players reciprocate actions in order to cooperate.&lt;ref&gt;Dufwenberg, M., &amp; Kirchsteiger, G. (2004). A theory of sequential reciprocity. Games and economic behavior, 47(2), 268-298.&lt;/ref&gt; The model had been used to more accurately predict experimental outcomes of classic games such as the prisoner's dilemma and the centipede game. Rabin (1993) also created a fairness equilibrium that measures altruism's effect on choices.&lt;ref name="rabin"&gt;Rabin, M. (1993). Incorporating fairness into game theory and economics. The American economic review, 1281-1302. (Incorporates social motives into game theory decision making)&lt;/ref&gt; He found that when a player is altruistic to another player the second player is more likely to reciprocate that altruism.&lt;ref name="rabin"/&gt; This is due to the idea of fairness.&lt;ref name="rabin"/&gt; Fairness equilibriums take the form of mutual maximum, where both players choose an outcome that benefits both of them the most, or mutual minimum, where both players choose an outcome that hurts both of them the most.&lt;ref name="rabin"/&gt; These equilibriums are also [[Nash equilibrium]]s, but they incorporate the willingness of participants to cooperate and play fair.

=== Incentives, consequences, and deception ===
The role of incentives and consequences in decision-making is interesting to behavioral game theorists because it affects rational behavior. Post (2008) analyzed Deal or no Deal contestant behavior in order to reach conclusions about decision-making when stakes are high.&lt;ref name="post"/&gt;  Studying the contestant's choices formed the conclusion that in a sequential game with high stakes decisions were based on previous outcomes rather than rationality.&lt;ref name="post"/&gt; Players who face a succession of good outcomes, in this case they eliminate the low-value cases from play, or players who face a succession of poor outcomes become less risk averse.&lt;ref name="post"/&gt; This means that players who are having exceptionally good or exceptionally bad outcomes are more likely to gamble and continue playing than average players. The lucky or unlucky players were willing to reject offers of over one hundred percent of the expected value of their case in order to continue playing.&lt;ref name="post"/&gt; This shows a shift from risk avoiding behavior to risk seeking behavior. This study highlights behavioral biases that are not accounted for by traditional game theory. Riskier behavior in unlucky contestants can be attributed to the break-even effect, which states that gamblers will continue to make risky decisions in order to win back money.&lt;ref name="post"/&gt; On the other hand, riskier behavior in lucky contestants can be explained by the house-money effect, which states that winning gamblers are more likely to make risky decisions because they perceive that they are not gambling with their own money.&lt;ref name="post"/&gt; This analysis shows that incentives influence rational choice, especially when players make a series of decisions.

Incentives and consequences also play a large role in deception in games. Gneezy (2005) studied deception using a cheap talk sender-receiver game.&lt;ref name="Gneezy"&gt;Gneezy, U. (2005). Deception: The role of consequences. American Economic Review, 384-394.&lt;/ref&gt; In this type of game player one receives information about the payouts of option A and option B. Then, player one gives a recommendation to player two about which option to take. Player one can choose to deceive player two, and player two can choose to reject player one's advice. Gneezy found that participants were more sensitive to their gain from lying than to their opponent's loss.&lt;ref name="Gneezy"/&gt; He also found that participants were not wholly selfish and cared about how much their opponents lost from their deception, but this effect diminished as their own payout increased.&lt;ref name="Gneezy"/&gt; These findings show that decision makers examine both incentives to lie and consequences of lying in order to decide whether or not to lie. In general people are averse to lying, but given the right incentives they tend to ignore consequences.&lt;ref name="Gneezy"/&gt; Wang (2009) also used a cheap talk game to study deception in participants with an incentive to deceive.&lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;Wang, J. T. Y., Spezio, M., &amp; Camerer, C. (2009). Pinocchio's pupil: Using eyetracking and pupil dilation to understand truth-telling and deception in sender-receiver game. American Economic Review, Forthcoming.&lt;/ref&gt; Using eye tracking he found that participants who received information about payoffs focused on their own payoff twice as often as their opponents.&lt;ref name="Wang"/&gt; This suggests minimal strategic thinking. Further, participants' pupils dilated when they sent a deceiving, and they dilated more when telling a bigger lie.&lt;ref name="Wang"/&gt; Through these physical cues Wang concluded that deception is cognitively difficult.&lt;ref name="Wang"/&gt; These findings show that factors such as incentives, consequences, and deception can create irrational decisions and affect the way games unfold.

=== Group decisions ===
Behavioral game theory considers the effects of groups on rationality. In the real world many decisions are made by teams, yet traditional game theory uses an individual as a decision maker. This created a need to model group decision-making behavior. Bornstein and Yaniv (1998) examined the difference in rationality between groups and individuals in an ultimatum game.&lt;ref name="born"&gt;Bornstein, G., &amp; Yaniv, I. (1998). Individual and group behavior in the ultimatum game: Are groups more “rational” players?. Experimental Economics, 1(1), 101-108.&lt;/ref&gt; In this game player one (or group one) decides what percentage of a payout to give to player two (or group two) and then player two decides whether to accept or reject this offer. Participants in the group condition were put in groups of three and allowed to deliberate on their decisions.&lt;ref name="born"/&gt; Perfect rationality in this game would be player one offering player two none of the payout, but that is almost never the case in observed offers. Bornstein and Yaniv found that groups were less generous, willing to give up a smaller portion of the payoff, in the player one condition and more accepting of low offers in the player two condition than individuals.&lt;ref name="born"/&gt; These results suggest that groups are more rational than individuals.&lt;ref name="born"/&gt;

Kocher and Sutter (2005) used a beauty contest game to study and compare individual and group behavior.&lt;ref name="ko"&gt;Kocher, M. G., &amp; Sutter, M. (2005). The Decision Maker Matters: Individual Versus Group Behaviour in Experimental Beauty‐Contest Games*. The Economic Journal, 115(500), 200-223.&lt;/ref&gt; A beauty contest game is one where all participants choose a number between zero and one hundred. The winner is the participant who chooses a number closest to two thirds of the average number. In the first round the rational choice would be thirty-three, as it is two thirds of the average number, fifty. Given an infinite number of rounds all participants should choose zero according to game theory. Kocher and Sutter found that groups did not perform more rationally than individuals in the first round of the game.&lt;ref name="ko"/&gt; However, groups performed more rationally than individuals in subsequent rounds.&lt;ref name="ko"/&gt; This shows that groups are able to learn the game and adapt their strategy faster than individuals.

Bunch, Christopher P. Nielsen and Danny C. Sorensen, expresses the eigenvectors of the sum of a [[symmetric matrix]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and the [[outer product]], &lt;math&gt;v v^T&lt;/math&gt;, of [[vector (mathematics)|vector]] &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; with itself.

==Statement==
Let &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; denote the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; denote the eigenvalues of the updated matrix &lt;math&gt;\tilde A = A + v v^T&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt; (\tilde q_i)_k = \frac{N_i v_k}{\lambda_k - \tilde \lambda_i} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; is a number that makes the vector &lt;math&gt;\tilde q_i&lt;/math&gt; normalized.

==Derivation==
This formula can be derived from the [[Sherman–Morrison formula]] by examining the poles of &lt;math&gt;(A-\tilde\lambda I+vv^T)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Remarks==

The eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\tilde A&lt;/math&gt; were studied by Golub.&lt;ref name="GOLUB73"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Golub | first1 = G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3718">{{hatlink|For the dog, see [[Chow Chow]].}}
In [[mathematics]], and more particularly in the field of [[algebraic geometry]], '''Chow coordinates''' are a generalization of [[Plücker coordinates]], applying to  ''m''-dimensional [[algebraic varieties]] of degree ''d'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}^n&lt;/math&gt;, that is, ''n''-dimensional [[projective space]]. They are named for [[Wei-Liang Chow]].

A '''Chow variety''' is a variety whose points correspond to all cycles of a given projective space of given dimension and degree.

==Definition==
To define the Chow coordinates, take the intersection of an algebraic variety ''Z'' of degree ''d'' and dimension ''m'' by linear subspaces ''U'' of  [[codimension]] ''m''. When  ''U'' is in [[general position]], the intersection will be a finite set of ''d'' distinct points.

Then the coordinates of the ''d'' points of intersection are algebraic functions of the [[Plücker coordinates]] of U, and by taking a symmetric function of the algebraic functions, a homogeneous polynomial known as the '''Chow form''' (or '''Cayley form''') of Z is obtained. 

The Chow coordinates are then the coefficients  of the Chow form. Chow coordinates can generate the smallest field of definition of a divisor. The Chow coordinates define a point in the projective space corresponding to all forms.

==Chow variety==
The closure of the possible Chow coordinates is called the Chow variety.&lt;!--
== Chow points ==
Let &lt;math&gt;V = \Gamma(\mathbf{P}^n, \mathcal{O}_{\mathbf{P}^n}(1))&lt;/math&gt;. By definition, a Chow point is a [[divisor (algebraic geometry)|divisor]] on &lt;math&gt;\check{\mathbf{P}^n} = \mathbf{P}(V^*).&lt;/math&gt;--&gt;

== Relation to Hilbert scheme ==
The [[Hilbert scheme]] is a variant of the Chow varieties. There is always a map (called the [[cycle map]])
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Hilb} \to \mathbf{Cycl}, \, Z \mapsto [Z]&lt;/math&gt;
from the [[Hilbert scheme]] to the Chow variety.

== Chow quotient ==
A '''Chow quotient''' parametrizes closures of [[generic orbit]]s. It is constructed as a closed subvariety of a Chow variety.

Kapranov's theorem says that the [[moduli space of curves|moduli space]] &lt;math&gt;\overline{M}_{0, n}&lt;/math&gt; of [[stable curve|stable]] genus-zero curves with ''n'' marked points is the Chow quotient of Grassmannian &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Gr}(2, \mathbb{C}^n)&lt;/math&gt; by the standard maximal torus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3335">In [[mathematics]], a [[partial order]] or [[total order]] &lt; on a set ''X'' is said to be '''dense''' if, for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X'' for which ''x'' &lt; ''y'', there is a ''z'' in ''X'' such that ''x'' &lt; ''z'' &lt; ''y''.

==Example==
The [[rational number]]s with the ordinary ordering are a densely ordered set in this sense, as are the [[real number]]s. On the other hand, the ordinary ordering on the [[integer]]s is not dense.

==Uniqueness==
[[Georg Cantor]] proved that every two densely totally ordered [[countable set]]s without lower or upper bounds are [[order isomorphism|order-isomorphic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Introduction to Modern Set Theory|volume=8|series=Pure and Applied Mathematics|first=Judith|last=Roitman|authorlink=Judith Roitman|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1990|isbn=9780471635192|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0euMlBhBxjMC&amp;pg=PA123|contribution=Theorem 27, p.&amp;nbsp;123}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, there exists an order-isomorphism between the [[rational number]]s and other densely ordered countable sets including the [[dyadic rational]]s and the [[algebraic number]]s. The proof of this result uses the [[back-and-forth method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Set Theory: With an Introduction to Real Point Sets|first=Abhijit|last=Dasgupta|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2013|isbn=9781461488545|page=161|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u06-BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Minkowski's question mark function]] can be used to determine the order isomorphisms between the quadratic algebraic numbers and the rational numbers, and between the rationals and the dyadic rationals.

==Generalizations==
Any [[binary relation]] ''R'' is said to be ''dense'' if, for all ''R''-related ''x'' and ''y'', there is a ''z'' such that ''x'' and  ''z'' and also ''z'' and  ''y'' are ''R''-related. Formally:
: &lt;math&gt; \forall x\  \forall y\ xRy\Rightarrow (\exists z\ xRz \land zRy).&lt;/math&gt; Alternatively, in terms of [[composition of relations|composition of ''R'' with itself]], the dense condition may be expressed as ''R'' ⊆ ''R R''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gunter Schmidt]] (2011) ''Relational Mathematics'', page 212, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{ISBN|978-0-521-76268-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sufficient condition]]s for a binary relation ''R'' in a set ''X'' to be dense are:
* ''R'' is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]];
* ''R'' is [[coreflexive relation|coreflexive]];
* ''R'' is [[quasireflexive relation|quasireflexive]];
* ''R'' is left or right [[Euclidean relation|Euclidean]]; or
* ''R'' is [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] and [[semi-connex relation|semi-connex]] and ''X'' has ≥3 elements.
None if them is [[necessary condition|necessary]].
A non-[[empty relation|empty]] and dense relation cannot be [[antitransitive]].

A strict [[partial order]] &lt; is a dense order [[iff]] &lt; is a dense relation. A dense relation that is also [[transitive relation|transitive]] is said to be [[idempotent relation|idempotent]].

'''Ernest William Hobson''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1934.0008 | title = Ernest William Hobson. 1856-1933 | journal = [[Obituary Notices of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 236–413 | year = 1934 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (27 October 1856 &amp;ndash; 19 April 1933) was an [[England|English]] [[mathematician]], now remembered mostly for his books, some of which broke new ground in their coverage in English of topics from [[mathematical analysis]]. He was [[Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathematics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] from 1910 to 1931.

==Life==

He was born in [[Derby]], and was educated at [[Derby School]], the [[Royal School of Mines]], and [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], graduating [[Senior wrangler]] in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=HB874EW|name=Hobson, Ernest William}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He was the brother of the [[economist]] [[John A. Hobson]].
He became a Fellow of Christ's almost immediately after graduation. He made his way into research mathematics only gradually, becoming an expert in the theory of [[spherical harmonics]].

His 1907 work on [[real analysis]] was something of a watershed in the British mathematical tradition; and was lauded by [[G. H. Hardy]].&lt;ref name=lms&gt;[http://www.lms.ac.uk/newsletter/323/323_11.html lms newsletter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018061028/http://www.lms.ac.uk/newsletter/323/323_11.html |date=2010-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It included material on [[general topology]] and [[Fourier series]] that was topical at the time; and included mistakes that were picked up later (for example by [[R. L. Moore]]).

From 1924 to 1927 [[Robert Pollock Gillespie]] studied under him.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Gillespie.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He is buried in the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground]] in Cambridge, with his wife Seline, born 25 March 1860, died 10 June 1940, by whom he had four sons, one of whom Walter William (1894 - 1930) is buried with them in the same grave.

In physics, '''event symmetry''' includes invariance principles that have been used in some discrete approaches to [[quantum gravity]] where the [[diffeomorphism invariance]] of [[general relativity]] can be extended to a [[Covariant transformation|covariance]] under every permutation of spacetime events.&lt;ref&gt;P. Gibbs, "The Principle of Event Symmetry.", International Journal of Theoretical Physics 35:1037–1062, (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The principle of event symmetry==

=== What it means ===
Since general relativity was discovered by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1915, observation and experiment have demonstrated that it is an accurate gravitation theory up to cosmic scales. On small scales, the laws of [[quantum mechanics]] have likewise been found to describe nature in a way consistent with every experiment performed, so far. To describe the laws of the universe fully a synthesis of general relativity and quantum mechanics must be found. Only then can physicists hope to understand the realms where gravity and quantum come together. The [[big bang]] is one such place.

The task to find such a theory of quantum gravity is one of the major scientific endeavours of our time. Many physicists believe that [[string theory]] is the leading candidate, but string theory has so far failed to provide an adequate description of the big bang, and its success is just as incomplete in other ways. That could be because physicists do not really know what the correct underlying principles of string theory are, so they do not have the right formulation that would allow them to answer the important questions. In particular, string theory treats [[spacetime]] in quite an old fashioned way even though it indicates that spacetime must be very different at small scales from what we are familiar with.

General relativity by contrast, is a model theory based on a geometric symmetry principle from which its dynamics can be elegantly derived. The symmetry is called [[general covariance]] or [[general covariance|diffeomorphism invariance]]. It says that the dynamical equations of the gravitational field and any matter must be unchanged in form under any smooth transformation of spacetime coordinates. To understand what that means you have to think of a region of spacetime as a set of ''events'', each one labelled by unique values of four coordinate values x,y,z, and t. The first three tell us ''where'' in space the event happened, while the fourth is time and tells us ''when'' it happened. But the choice of coordinates that are used is arbitrary, so the laws of physics should not depend on what the choice is. It follows that if any smooth mathematical function is used to map one coordinate system to any other, the equations of dynamics must transform in such a way that they look the same as they did before. This symmetry principle is a strong constraint on the possible range of equations and can be used to derive the laws of gravity almost uniquely.

The principle of general covariance works on the assumption that spacetime is smooth and continuous. Although this fits in with our normal experience, there are reasons to suspect that it may not be a suitable assumption for quantum gravity. In quantum field theory, continuous fields are replaced with a more complex structure that has a dual particle-wave nature as if they can be both continuous and discrete depending on how you measure them. Research in string theory and several other approaches to quantum gravity suggest that spacetime must also have a dual continuous and discrete nature, but without the power to probe spacetime at sufficient energies it is difficult to measure its properties directly to find out how such a quantised spacetime should work.

This is where event symmetry comes in. In a discrete spacetime treated as a disordered set of events it is natural to extend the symmetry of general covariance to a discrete event symmetry in which any function mapping the set of events to itself replaces the smooth functions used in general relativity. Such a function is also called a [[permutation]], so the principle of event symmetry states that the equations governing the laws of physics must be unchanged when transformed by any permutation of spacetime events.

=== How it works ===

It is not immediately obvious how event symmetry could work. It seems to say that taking one part of space time and swapping it with another part a long distance away is a valid physical operation, and that the laws of physics must be written to support this. Clearly this symmetry can only be correct if it is hidden or broken. To get this in perspective consider what the symmetry of general relativity seems to say. A smooth coordinate transformation or diffeomorphism can stretch and twist spacetime in any way so long as it is not torn. The laws of general relativity are unchanged in form under such a transformation. Yet this does not mean that objects can be stretched or bent without being opposed by a physical force. Likewise, event symmetry does not mean that objects can be torn apart in the way the permutations of spacetime would make us believe. In the case of general relativity the gravitational force acts as a background field that controls the measurement properties of spacetime. In ordinary circumstances the geometry of space is flat and Euclidean and the diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity is hidden thanks to this background field. Only in the extreme proximity of a violent collision of [[black hole]]s would the flexibility of spacetime become apparent. In a similar way, event symmetry could be hidden by a background field that determines not just the geometry of spacetime, but also its topology.

General relativity is often explained in terms of curved spacetime. We can picture the universe as the curved surface of a membrane like a soap film that changes dynamically in time. The same picture can help us understand how event symmetry would be broken. A soap bubble is made from molecules that interact via forces that depend on the orientations of the molecules and the distance between them. If you wrote down the equations of motion for all the molecules in terms of their positions, velocities and orientations, then those equations would be unchanged in form under any permutation of the molecules (which we will assume are all the same). This is mathematically analogous to the event symmetry of spacetime events. The equations may be different, and unlike the molecules on the surface of a bubble, the events of spacetime are not embedded in a higher-dimensional space, yet the mathematical principle is the same.

Physicists do not presently know if event symmetry is a correct symmetry of nature, but the example of a [[soap bubble]] shows that it is a logical possibility. If it can be used to explain real physical observations then it merits serious consideration.

=== Maximal permutability ===
American philosopher of physics [[John Stachel]] has used permutability of spacetime events to generalize Einstein's [[hole argument]].&lt;ref&gt;J Stachel, "`The Relations Between Things' versus `The Things Between Relations': The Deeper Meaning of the Hole Argument", in Reading Natural Philosophy/ Essays in the History and Philosophy of Science and Mathematics, ed. David Malament Chicago and LaSalle, IL, Open Court pp 231-266 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Stachel uses the term [[quiddity]] to describe the universal qualities of an entity and [[haecceity]] to describe its individuality. He makes use of the analogy with quantum mechanical particles, that have quiddity but no haecceity. The permutation symmetry of systems of particles leaves the equations of motion and the description of the system invariant. This is generalised to a ''principle of maximal permutability''&lt;ref&gt;J. Stachel, "Structure, individuality and quantum gravity" in Structural Foundations of Quantum Gravity, edited by D.P. Rickles, S.R.D. French and J. Saatsi Oxford University Press (2005) {{arxiv|gr-qc/0507078}}
&lt;/ref&gt; that should be applied to physical entities. In an approach to quantum gravity where spacetime events are discrete, the principle implies that physics must be symmetric under any permutations of events, so the principle of event symmetry is a special case of the principle of maximal permutability.

Stachel's view builds on the work of philosophers such as [[Gottfried Leibniz]] whose [[monadology]] proposed that the world should be viewed only in terms of relations between objects rather than their absolute positions. [[Ernst Mach]] used this to formulate his relational principle, which influenced Einstein in his formulation of general relativity. Some quantum gravity physicists believe that the true theory of quantum gravity will be a [[relational theory]] with no spacetime. The events of spacetime are then no longer a background in which physics happens. Instead they are just the set of events where an interaction between entities took place. Characteristics of spacetime that we are familiar with (such as distance, continuity and dimension) should be [[Emergence|emergent]] in such a theory, rather than put in by hand.

=={{visible anchor|Quantum graphity}} and other random graph models==
In a [[random graph]] model of spacetime, points in space or events in spacetime are represented by nodes of a graph. Each node may be connected to any other node by a link. In mathematical terms this structure is called a graph. The smallest number of links that it takes to go between two nodes of the graph can be interpreted as a measure of the distance between them in space. The dynamics can be represented either by using a [[Hamiltonian mechanics#Mathematical formalism|Hamiltonian]] formalism if the nodes are points in space, or a [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] formalism if the nodes are events in spacetime. Either way, the dynamics allow the links to connect or disconnect in a random  way according to specified probability rule. The model is event-symmetric if the rules are invariant under any permutation of the graph nodes.

The mathematical discipline of [[random graph]] theory was founded in the 1950s by [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Alfréd Rényi]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Erdős, A Rényi,  "On Random Graphs I", Publ. Math. Debrecen 6, p. 290–297, (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; They proved the existence of sudden changes in characteristics of a random graph as parameters of the model varied. These are similar to phase transitions in physical systems. The subject has been extensively studied since with applications in many areas including computation and biology. A standard text is "Random Graphs" by [[Béla Bollobás]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Bollobás, "Random Graphs", 2nd Edition, Cambridge University Press, (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Application to quantum gravity came later. Early random graph models of space-time have been proposed by Frank Antonsen (1993),&lt;ref&gt;F. Antenson, "Random graphs as a model for pregeometry", Int.J.Theor.Phys. 33, 1189, (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Manfred Requardt (1996)&lt;ref&gt;M. Requardt, "Emergence of Space-Time on the Planck Scale within the Scheme of Dynamical Cellular Networks and Random Graphs", (1996), {{arxiv|hep-th/9612185}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas Filk (2000).&lt;ref&gt;T. Filk, "Random graph gauge theories as toy models for nonperturbative string theories.", Class. Quantum Grav. 17 4841-4854, (2000), {{arxiv|hep-th/0010126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tomasz Konopka, [[Fotini Markopoulou-Kalamara]], [[Simone Severini]], and [[Lee Smolin]] of the Canadian [[Perimeter Institute]] for Theoretical Physics introduced a graph model that they called '''Quantum Graphity'''.&lt;ref&gt;T Konopka, F Markopoulou, L Smolin, "Quantum Graphity", (2006), {{arxiv|hep-th/0611197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T Konopka, F Markopoulou, S Severini, Quantum Graphity: a model of emergent locality, (2008), {{arxiv|0801.0861}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Hamma, F Markopoulou, S Lloyd, F Caravelli, S Severini, K Markstrom, "A quantum Bose-Hubbard model with evolving graph as toy model for emergent spacetime", (2009) {{arxiv|0911.5075}}, F. Caravelli, F. Markopoulou, "Quantum Graphity at Low Temperature", (2010) {{arxiv|1008.1340}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An argument based on quantum graphity combined with the [[holographic principle]] can resolve the [[horizon problem]] and explain the observed [[scale invariance]] of
[[cosmic background radiation]] fluctuations without the need for [[cosmic inflation]].&lt;ref&gt;J Magueijo, L Smolin, C Contaldi, "Holography and the scale-invariance of density fluctuations", (2006),{{arxiv|astro-ph/0611695}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Caravelli, F. Markopoulou, "Properties of Quantum Graphity at Low Temperature", (2010),{{arxiv|1008.1340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the quantum graphity model, points in spacetime are represented by nodes on a graph connected by links that can be ''on'' or ''off''. This indicates whether or not the two points are directly connected as if they are next to each other in spacetime. When they are ''on'' the links have additional state variables that define the random dynamics of the graph under the influence of quantum fluctuations and temperature. At high temperature the graph is in ''Phase I'' where all the points are randomly connected to each other and no concept of spacetime as we know it exists. As the temperature drops and the graph cools, it is conjectured to undergo a phase transition to a ''Phase II'' where spacetime forms. It will then look like a spacetime manifold on large scales with only near-neighbour points being connected in the graph. The hypothesis of quantum graphity is that this ''geometrogenesis'' models the condensation of spacetime in the [[big bang]].

==Event symmetry and string theory==
String theory is formulated on a background spacetime just as quantum field theory is. Such a background fixes spacetime curvature, which in general relativity is like saying that the gravitational field is fixed. However, analysis shows that the excitations of the string fields act as [[gravitons]], which can perturb the gravitational field away from the fixed background. So, string theory actually includes dynamic quantised gravity. More detailed studies have shown that different string theories in different background spacetimes can be related by dualities. There is also good evidence that string theory supports changes in topology of spacetime. Relativists have therefore criticised string theory for not being formulated in a background independent way, so that changes of spacetime geometry and topology can be more directly expressed in terms of the fundamental degrees of freedom of the strings.

The difficulty in achieving a truly background independent formulation for [[string theory]] is demonstrated by a problem known as Witten's Puzzle.&lt;ref&gt;E. Witten, "Space-time Transitions in String Theory", (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ed Witten]] asked the question "What could the full symmetry group of string theory be if it includes diffeomorphism invariance on a spacetime with changing topology?". This is hard to answer because the diffeomorphism group for each spacetime topology is different and there is no natural way to form a larger group containing them all such that the action of the group on continuous spacetime events makes sense. This puzzle is solved if the spacetime is regarded as a discrete set of events with different topologies formed dynamically as different string field configurations. Then the full symmetry need only contain the permutation group of spacetime events. Since any diffeomorphism for any topology is a special kind of permutation on the discrete events, the permutation group does contain all the different diffeomorphism groups for all possible topologies.

There is some evidence from Matrix Models that event-symmetry is included in string theory. A random matrix model can be formed from a random graph model by taking the variables on the links of the graph and arranging them in a N by N square matrix, where N is the number of nodes on the graph. The element of the matrix in the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; column and m&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; row gives the variable on the link joining the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; nodes to the m&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; node. The event-symmetry can then be extended to a larger N dimensional rotational symmetry.

In string theory, [[random matrix]] models were introduced to provide a non-perturbative formulation of [[M-Theory]] using [[noncommutative geometry]]. Coordinates of spacetime are normally [[commutative]] but in noncommutative geometry they are replaced by matrix operators that do not commute. In the original M(atrix) Theory these matrices were interpreted as connections between [[instantons]] (also known as D0-branes), and the matrix rotations were a gauge symmetry. Later, Iso and Kawai reinterpreted this as a permutation symmetry of space-time events&lt;ref&gt;S. Iso, H. Kawai, "Space-time and matter in IIB matrix model: Gauge symmetry and diffeomorphism.", Int. J. Mod. Phys. A15:651-666,(2000), {{arxiv|hep-th/9903217}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that diffeomorphism invariance was included in this symmetry. The two interpretations are equivalent if no distinction is made between instantons and events, which is what would be expected in a relational theory. This shows that Event Symmetry can already be regarded as part of string theory.

==Trivia==

=== Greg Egan's dust theory ===
The first known publication of the idea of event symmetry is in a work of science fiction rather than a journal of science{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}. [[Greg Egan]] used the idea in a short story called "Dust" in 1992&lt;ref&gt;G. Egan, "Dust", Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine, July 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded it into the novel [[Permutation City]] in 1994. Egan used dust theory as a way of exploring the question of whether a perfect computer simulation of a person differs from the real thing. However, his description of the dust theory as an extension of general relativity is also a consistent statement of the principle of event symmetry as used in quantum gravity.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The essence of the argument can be found in chapter 12 of "Permutation City". Paul, the main character of the story set in the future, has created a copy of himself in a computer simulator. The simulation runs on a distributed network sufficiently powerful to emulate his thoughts and experiences. Paul argues that the events of his simulated world have been remapped to events in the real world by the computer in a way that resembles a coordinate transformation in relativity. General relativity only allows for covariance under continuous transformations whereas the computer network has formed a discontinuous mapping that permutes events like "a cosmic anagram". Yet Paul's copy in the simulator experiences physics as if it were unchanged. Paul realises that this is "Like […] gravity and acceleration in General Relativity&amp;thinsp;—&amp;thinsp;it all depends on what you can't tell apart. This is a new Principle of Equivalence, a new symmetry between observers."

'''Exponential random graph models''' (ERGMs) are a family of [[statistical model]]s for analyzing data about [[social network|social]] and [[network science|other networks]].

==Background==
Many metrics exist to describe the structural features of an observed network such as the density, centrality, or assortativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wasserman |first1=Stanley |author-link1=Stanley Wasserman |last2=Faust |first2=Katherine |title=Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-521-38707-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newman |first=M.E.J. |title=The Structure and Function of Complex Networks |journal=SIAM Review |volume=45 |number=2 |pages=167–256 |doi=10.1137/S003614450342480|arxiv=cond-mat/0303516 |bibcode=2003SIAMR..45..167N }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these metrics describe the observed network which is only one instance of a large number of possible alternative networks. This set of alternative networks may have similar or dissimilar structural features. To support [[statistical inference]] on the processes influencing the formation of network structure, a [[statistical model]] should consider the set of all possible alternative networks weighted on their similarity to an observed network. However because network data is inherently relational, it violates the assumptions of independence and identical distribution of standard statistical models like [[linear regression]].&lt;ref name="Contractor"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Contractor |first1=Noshir |last2=Wasserman |first2=Stanley |last3=Faust |first3=Katherine |title=Testing Multitheoretical, Multilevel Hypotheses About Organizational Networks: An Analytic Framework and Empirical Example |journal=Academy of Management Review |volume=31 |number=3 |pages=681–703 |doi=10.5465/AMR.2006.21318925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative statistical models should reflect the uncertainty associated with a given observation, permit inference about the relative frequency about network substructures of theoretical interest, disambiguating the influence of confounding processes, efficiently representing complex structures, and linking local-level processes to global-level properties.&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robins |first1=G. |last2=Pattison |first2=P. |last3=Kalish |first3=Y. |last4=Lusher |first4=D.|year=2007 |title=An introduction to exponential random graph models for social networks |journal=Social Networks|volume=29 |pages=173–191 |doi=10.1016/j.socnet.2006.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Degree-preserving randomization]], for example, is a specific way in which an observed network could be considered in terms of multiple alternative networks.

==Definition==
The [[Exponential family]] is a broad family of models for covering many types of data, not just networks. An ERGM is a model from this family which describes networks.

Formally a [[random graph]] &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; consists of a set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; nodes and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; dyads (edges) &lt;math&gt;\{ Y_{ij}: i=1,\dots,n; j=1,\dots,n\}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;Y_{ij}=1&lt;/math&gt; if the nodes &lt;math&gt;(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; are connected and &lt;math&gt;Y_{ij}=0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise.

The basic assumption of these models is that the structure in an observed graph &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; can be explained by any statistics &lt;math&gt;s(y)&lt;/math&gt; depending on the observed network and nodal attributes. This way, it is possible to describe any kind of dependence between the undyadic variables:

&lt;math&gt;
P(Y = y | \theta) = \frac{\exp(\theta^{T} s(y))}{c(\theta)}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of model parameters associated with &lt;math&gt;s(y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is a normalising constant.

These models represent a probability distribution on each possible network on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; nodes. However, the size of the set of possible networks for an undirected network (simple graph) of size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;2^{n(n-1)/2}&lt;/math&gt;. Because the number of possible networks in the set vastly outnumbers the number of parameters which can constrain the model, the ideal probability distribution is the one which maximizes the [[Gibbs entropy]].&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman |first=M.E.J.|title=Networks|chapter=Other Network Models|pages=565–585 |isbn=978-0-19-920665-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4351">In [[computer algebra]], the '''Faugère F4 algorithm''', by [[Jean-Charles Faugère]], computes the [[Gröbner basis]] of an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of a multivariate [[polynomial ring]].  The algorithm uses the same mathematical principles as the [[Buchberger algorithm]], but computes many normal forms in one go by forming a generally [[sparse matrix]] and using fast linear algebra to do the reductions in parallel.

The '''Faugère F5 algorithm''' first calculates the Gröbner basis of a pair of generator polynomials of the ideal.  Then it uses this basis to reduce the size of the initial matrices of generators for the next larger basis: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If ''G''&lt;sub&gt;prev&lt;/sub&gt; is an already computed Gröbner basis (''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;) and we want to compute a Gröbner basis of (''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''G''&lt;sub&gt;prev&lt;/sub&gt; then we will construct matrices whose rows are ''m''&amp;nbsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''m'' is a monomial not divisible by the leading term of an element of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;prev&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This strategy allows the algorithm to apply two new criteria based on what Faugère calls ''signatures'' of polynomials. Thanks to these criteria, the algorithm can compute Gröbner bases for a large class of interesting polynomial systems, called ''[[regular sequence]]s'', without ever simplifying a single polynomial to zero—the most time-consuming operation in algorithms that compute Gröbner bases. It is also very effective for a large number of non-regular sequences.

== Implementations ==

The Faugère F4 algorithm is implemented 
* in [http://www-polsys.lip6.fr/~jcf/FGb/index.html FGb],  Faugère's own implementation, which includes interfaces for using it from [[C/C++]] or [[Maple (software)|Maple]],
* in [[Maple computer algebra system]], as the option '''method=fgb''' of function '''Groebner[gbasis]''' (this is an older version of FGb, with limitations of the size of the problems that can be solved),
* in the [[Magma computer algebra system]],
* in the [[SageMath]] computer algebra system,
* in [[SymPy]] [[Python (programming language)|Python]] package.

Study versions of the Faugère F5 algorithm is implemented in{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7475">In [[mathematics]], the '''formal derivative''' is an operation on elements of a [[polynomial ring]] or a ring of [[formal power series]] that mimics the form of the derivative from [[derivative|calculus]].  Though they appear similar, the algebraic advantage of a formal derivative is that it does not rely on the notion of a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]], which is in general impossible to define for a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]].  Many of the properties of the derivative are true of the formal derivative, but some, especially those that make numerical statements, are not.

Formal differentiation is used in algebra to test for [[multiple roots of a polynomial]].

==Definition==
The definition of formal derivative is as follows: fix a ring ''R'' (not necessarily commutative) and let ''A'' = ''R''[''x''] be the ring of polynomials over ''R''.  Then the formal derivative is an operation on elements of ''A'', where if

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)\,=\,a_n x^n + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0&lt;/math&gt;

then its formal derivative is

:&lt;math&gt;f'(x)\,=\,Df(x) = n a_n x^{n - 1} + \cdots + 2 a_2 x + a_1&lt;/math&gt;

just as for polynomials over the [[real numbers|real]] or [[complex numbers|complex]] numbers. Here &lt;math&gt;m a_i&lt;/math&gt; does not mean multiplication in the ring, but rather &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^m a_i,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is never used inside the sum.

There is a problem with this definition for noncommutative rings. The formula itself is correct, but there is no standard form of a polynomial. Therefore using this definition it is difficult to prove &lt;math&gt;(f(x)\cdot b)'=f'(x)\cdot b.&lt;/math&gt;

==Alternative definition well suited for noncommutative rings==
Let for &lt;math&gt;r\in R&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;r'=0,&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;x'=1.&lt;/math&gt;
Let us define derivative for expressions, such that &lt;math&gt;(a+b)'=a'+b',&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(a\cdot b)'=a'\cdot b+a\cdot b'.&lt;/math&gt;

We must prove that this definition gives the same result for an expression independent on the method the expression was evaluated, therefore that it is compatible with the axioms of equality.
*&lt;math&gt;(a+b)'=a'+b'=b'+a'=(b+a)',&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;((a+b)+c)'=(a+b)'+c'=(a'+b')+c'=a'+(b'+c')=a'+(b+c)'=(a+(b+c))',&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;(a(bc))'=a'(bc)+a(bc)'=a'bc+a(b'c+bc')=a'bc+ab'c+abc'=&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=(a'b+ab')c+(ab)c'=(ab)'c+(ab)c'=((ab)c)',&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;((a+b)c)'=(a+b)'c+(a+b)c'=(a'+b')c+(a+b)c'=(a'c+b'c)+(ac'+bc')=&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\cdots=(a'c+(b'c+ac'))+bc'=(a'c+(ac'+b'c))+bc'=\cdots=(a'c+ac')+(b'c+bc')=&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=(ac)'+(bc)'=(ac+bc)',&lt;/math&gt;
and the distributivity from the other side from symmetry.

Linearity naturally follows from the definition.

Formula for derivative of a polynomial (in standard shape for commutative rings) is direct consequence of the definition:
&lt;math&gt;(\sum_i a_ix^i)'=\sum_i (a_ix^i)'=\sum_i ((a_i)'x^i+a_i(x^i)')=\sum_i(0x^i+a_i(\sum_{j=1}^ix^{j-1}(x')x^{i-j}))=\sum_i\sum_{j=1}^i a_ix^{i-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
It can be verified that:

* Formal differentiation is linear: for any two polynomials ''f''(''x''), ''g''(''x'') and elements ''r'', ''s'' of ''R'', we have

::&lt;math&gt;(r \cdot f + s \cdot g)'(x) = r \cdot f'(x) + s \cdot g'(x).&lt;/math&gt;

:When ''R'' is not commutative there is another, different linearity property in which ''r'' and ''s'' appear on the right rather than on the left.  When ''R'' does not contain an identity element then neither of these reduces to the case of simply a sum of polynomials or the sum of a polynomial with a multiple of another polynomial, which must also be included as a "linearity" property.

* The formal derivative satisfies the [[Product rule|Leibniz rule]], or product rule:

::&lt;math&gt;(f \cdot g)'(x) = f'(x) \cdot g(x) + f(x) \cdot g'(x).&lt;/math&gt;

:Note the order of the factors; when ''R'' is not commutative this is important.

These two properties make ''D'' a [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]] on ''A'' (see also [[module of relative differential forms]] for a discussion of a generalization).

==Application to finding repeated factors==
As in calculus, the derivative detects multiple roots: if ''R'' is a field then ''R''[''x''] is a [[Euclidean domain]], and in this situation we can define multiplicity of roots; namely, for every polynomial ''f''(''x'') and every element ''r'' of ''R'', there exists a nonnegative integer ''m&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' and a polynomial ''g''(''x'') such that

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = (x - r)^{m_r} g(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g''(''r'') is not equal to ''0''.  ''m&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the multiplicity of ''r'' as a root of ''f''.  It follows from the Leibniz rule that in this situation, ''m&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' is also the number of differentiations that must be performed on ''f''(''x'') before ''r'' is not a root of the resulting polynomial.  The utility of this observation is that although in general not every polynomial of degree ''n'' in ''R''[''x''] has ''n'' roots counting multiplicity (this is the maximum, by the above theorem), we may pass to [[field extension]]s in which this is true (namely, [[algebraic closure]]s).  Once we do, we may uncover a multiple root that was not a root at all simply over ''R''.  For example, if ''R'' is the field with three elements, the polynomial

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)\,=\,x^6 + 1&lt;/math&gt;

has no roots in ''R''; however, its formal derivative is zero since 3 = 0 in ''R'' and in any extension of ''R'', so when we pass to the algebraic closure it has a multiple root that could not have been detected by factorization in ''R'' itself.  Thus, formal differentiation allows an [[computability theory (computer science)|effective]] notion of multiplicity.  This is important in [[Galois theory]], where the distinction is made between [[separable field extension]]s (defined by polynomials with no multiple roots) and inseparable ones.

==Correspondence to analytic derivative==
When the ring ''R'' of scalars is commutative, there is an alternative and equivalent definition of the formal derivative, which resembles the one seen in differential calculus. The element Y–X of the ring ''R''[X,Y] divides Y&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; – X&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; for any nonnegative integer ''n'', and therefore divides ''f''(Y) – ''f''(X) for any polynomial ''f'' in one indeterminate. If the quotient (in ''R''[X,Y]) is denoted by ''g'':

:&lt;math&gt;g(X,Y) = \frac{f(Y) - f(X)}{Y - X}&lt;/math&gt;

then it is not hard to verify that ''g''(X,X) (in ''R''[X]) coincides with the formal derivative of ''f'' as it was defined above.

This formulation of the derivative works equally well for a formal power series, assuming only that the ring of scalars is commutative.

Actually, if the division in this definition is carried out in the class of functions of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; continuous at &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, it will recapture the classical definition of the derivative. If it is carried out in the class of functions continuous in both &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, we get uniform differentiability, and our function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; will be continuously differentiable. Likewise, by choosing different classes of functions (say, the Lipschitz class), we get different flavors of differentiability. This way differentiation becomes a part of algebra of functions.

The '''hierarchical decision process''' ('''HDP''') refines the classical [[analytic hierarchy process]] (AHP) a step further in eliciting and evaluating subjective judgements.  These improvements, proposed initially by Dr. Jang Ra (a student of Dr. [[Thomas L. Saaty]] who developed and refined AHP) include the constant-sum measurement scale (1–99 scale) for comparing two elements, the logarithmic [[least squares method]] (LLSM) for computing normalized values, the sum of inverse column sums (SICS) for measuring the degree of (in)consistency, and sensitivity analysis of pairwise comparisons [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]].  These subtle modifications address issues concerning normal AHP consistency and applicability in the process of constructing hierarchies: generating criteria, classifying/selecting criteria, and screening/selecting decision alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentCon.jsp?punumber=586 Technology Management: the New International Language]'', 27–31 Oct 1991, pp.&amp;nbsp;595–599, {{ISBN|0-7803-0161-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2699">In [[geometry]], any [[hyperplane]] ''H'' of a [[projective space]] ''P'' may be taken as a '''hyperplane at infinity'''. Then the [[set complement]] {{nowrap|''P'' ∖ ''H''}} is called an [[affine space]]. For instance, if {{nowrap|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are [[homogeneous coordinates]] for ''n''-dimensional projective space, then the equation {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}} defines a hyperplane at infinity for the ''n''-dimensional affine space with coordinates {{nowrap|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. ''H'' is also called the '''ideal hyperplane'''.

Similarly, starting from an affine space ''A'', every class of [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines can be associated with a [[point at infinity]]. The [[union (set theory)|union]] over all classes of parallels constitute the points of the hyperplane at infinity. Adjoining the points of this hyperplane (called '''ideal points''') to ''A'' converts it into an ''n''-dimensional projective space, such as the real projective space {{nowrap|'''R'''P&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

By adding these ideal points, the entire affine space ''A'' is completed to a projective space ''P'', which may be called the '''projective completion''' of ''A''.  Each [[affine subspace]] ''S'' of ''A'' is completed to a [[projective space|projective subspace]] of ''P'' by adding to ''S'' all the ideal points corresponding to the directions of the lines contained in ''S''.  The resulting projective subspaces are often called ''affine subspaces'' of the projective space ''P'', as opposed to the '''infinite''' or '''ideal''' subspaces, which are the subspaces of the hyperplane at infinity (however, they are projective spaces, not affine spaces).

In the projective space, each projective subspace of dimension ''k'' intersects the ideal hyperplane in a projective subspace "at infinity" whose dimension is {{nowrap|''k'' − 1}}.

A pair of non-[[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] affine hyperplanes intersect at an affine subspace of dimension {{nowrap|''n'' − 2}}, but a parallel pair of affine hyperplanes intersect at a projective subspace of the ideal hyperplane (the intersection ''lies on'' the ideal hyperplane). Thus, parallel hyperplanes, which did not meet in the affine space, intersect in the projective completion due to the addition of the hyperplane at infinity.

'''''In silico'' medicine''' (also known as "'''computational medicine'''") is the application of ''[[in silico]]'' research to problems involving health and medicine.  It is the direct use of [[computer simulation]] in the [[medicine|diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of a disease]]. More specifically, ''in silico'' medicine is characterized by [[Computer model|modeling]], [[simulation]], and visualization of biological and medical processes in computers with the goal of simulating real biological processes in a virtual environment.&lt;ref name="cordis_insilicomedicine"&gt;{{cite web | title = Project Success Stories - In silico medicine reaches the clinic | work = European Commission CORDIS | accessdate = 9 November 2017 | url = http://cordis.europa.eu/result/rcn/86061_en.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term ''in silico'' was first used in 1989 at a workshop "Cellular Automata: Theory and Applications" by a mathematician from National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).&lt;ref name="orchestra-qsar.eu"&gt;http://www.orchestra-qsar.eu/about-in-silico-methods&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''in silico radiation oncology'', a precursor of generic ''in silico'' medicine was coined and first introduced by G. Stamatakos in Proceedings of the IEEE in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;G.Stamatakos, D.Dionysiou, E.Zacharaki, N.Mouravliansky, K.Nikita, N.Uzunoglu,"In silico radiation oncology: combining novel simulation algorithms with current visualization techniques," Proceedings of the IEEE, vol.90, issue 11, 2002, pp.1764-1777, DOI: 10.1109/JPROC.2002.804685 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1046955&amp;abstractAccess=no&amp;userType=inst&lt;/ref&gt; The same researcher coined and introduced the more generic term ''in silico oncology''.&lt;ref&gt;Stamatakos, Georgios.; (2006) "Spotlight on Cancer Informatics" Cancer Informatics (2) pp.83-86 [https://doi.org/10.1177/117693510600200029 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/117693510600200029] OPEN ACCESS&lt;/ref&gt; ''In silico'' medicine is considered an extension of previous work using mathematical models of biological systems&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stamatakos|first=Georgios S.|date=2006|title=Spotlight on Cancer Informatics|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/117693510600200029|journal=Cancer Informatics|language=en|volume=2|pages=|doi=10.1177/117693510600200029|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  It became apparent that the techniques used to model biological systems has utility to explain and predict dynamics in the medical field.  The first fields in medicine to use ''in silico'' modeling were genetics, physiology and biochemistry.  The field saw a dramatic influx of data when the human genome was sequenced in the 1980s and 1990s.  Concurrently the increase in available computational power allowed for modeling of complex systems that were previously impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schneider|first=Maria Victoria|title=In Silico Systems Biology|publisher=Methods in Molecular Biology|isbn=978-1-62703-449-4|pages=Chapter 1|url=http://www.springerprotocols.com/doiresolver?genre=book&amp;pid=10.1007/978-1-62703-450-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
There are numerous reasons why ''in silico'' medicine is used.  For example, ''in silico'' medical modeling can allow for early prediction of success of a compound for a medicinal purpose and elucidate potential adverse effects early in the [[drug discovery]] process.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmet, Ahmet; Sean, Ekins; Sandhya, Kortagere. "Applications and Limitations of In Silico Models in Drug Discovery." Bioinformatics and Drug Discovery, 2012-01-08.

The term ''in silico'' medicine is exemplified in initiatives such as the [[Virtual Physiological Human]] by the [[European Commission]]&lt;ref name="fp7_EC"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) | work = FP7 European Commission | accessdate = 10 May 2013 | url = http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/home_en.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in institutes such as the VPH Institute and the INSIGNEO Institute at the University of Sheffield.

Web. 10 Apr. 2014. http://in-silico-oncology.iccs.ntua.gr/english/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; at the Institute of Communication and Computer Systems, National Technical Institute of Athens (ICCS-NTUA) aims at developing clinically driven and oriented multiscale simulation models of [[malignant tumors]] (cancer) to be utilized as patient individualized decision support and treatment planning systems following completion of clinical adaptation and validation. An additional aim of the Group's research is to simulate oncological clinical trials which would otherwise be too costly or time intensive and to this direction, [[grid computing]] infrastructures have been exploited, such as the [[European Grid Infrastructure]], to increase the performance and effectiveness of the simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Athanaileas, Theodoros| title=Exploiting grid technologies for the simulation of clinical trials: the paradigm of in silico radiation oncology | journal=SIMULATION: Transactions of The Society for Modeling and Simulation International | volume=87 | number=10 | pages=893–910 | year=2011 | publisher=Sage Publications | doi=10.1177/0037549710375437|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISOG has led the development of the first technologically integrated  ''Oncosimulator'', a joint Euro-Japanese research venture.&lt;ref&gt;G.

In 2003, the first vaccine based solely off of genomic information was developed.  The technique of developing the vaccine, termed "reverse vaccinology," used the genomic information and not the infectious bacteria itself to develop the vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v26/n6/full/nbt0608-597b.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
As modeling of human, social, behavioral, and cultural (HSBC) characteristics of patient behavior becomes more sophisticated, there is speculation that virtual patients may replace patient actors in medical school curriculum.  Additionally, there are projects underway that utilize virtual cadavers, computer simulated models of human anatomy based on CT images of real people.&lt;ref&gt;Sokolowski, John A., Banks, Catherine M.

Main contributors to the field are Alessandro Berarducci, Petr Hájek, Konstantin Ignatiev, [[Giorgi Japaridze]], Franco Montagna, Vladimir Shavrukov, Rineke Verbrugge, Albert Visser, and Domenico Zambella.

== Examples ==

* '''Logic ILM''': The language of ILM extends that of classical propositional logic by adding the unary modal operator &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; and the binary modal operator &lt;math&gt;\triangleright&lt;/math&gt; (as always, &lt;math&gt;\Diamond p&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\neg \Box\neg p&lt;/math&gt;). The arithmetical interpretation of &lt;math&gt;\Box p&lt;/math&gt; is “&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is provable in Peano Arithmetic PA”, and &lt;math&gt;p \triangleright q&lt;/math&gt; is understood as “&lt;math&gt;PA+q&lt;/math&gt; is interpretable in &lt;math&gt;PA+p&lt;/math&gt;”. 

Axiom schemata: 

1. All classical tautologies

2. &lt;math&gt;\Box(p \rightarrow q) \rightarrow (\Box p \rightarrow \Box q)&lt;/math&gt;

3. &lt;math&gt;\Box(\Box p \rightarrow p) \rightarrow \Box p&lt;/math&gt;

4. &lt;math&gt; \Box (p \rightarrow q) \rightarrow (p \triangleright q)&lt;/math&gt;

5. &lt;math&gt; (p \triangleright q)\wedge  (q \triangleright r)\rightarrow (p\triangleright r)&lt;/math&gt;

6. &lt;math&gt; (p \triangleright r)\wedge  (q \triangleright r)\rightarrow ((p\vee q)\triangleright r)&lt;/math&gt;

7. &lt;math&gt; (p \triangleright q)\rightarrow (\Diamond p \rightarrow \Diamond q) &lt;/math&gt;

8. &lt;math&gt; \Diamond p \triangleright p &lt;/math&gt;

9. &lt;math&gt; (p \triangleright q)\rightarrow((p\wedge\Box r)\triangleright (q\wedge\Box r)) &lt;/math&gt;

Rules inference: 

1. “From &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p\rightarrow q&lt;/math&gt; conclude &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;” 

2. “From &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; conclude &lt;math&gt;\Box p&lt;/math&gt;”.

The completeness of ILM with respect to its arithmetical interpretation was independently proven by Alessandro Berarducci and Vladimir Shavrukov.  


* '''Logic TOL''': The language of TOL extends that of classical propositional logic by adding the modal operator &lt;math&gt;\Diamond&lt;/math&gt; which is allowed to take any nonempty sequence of arguments. The arithmetical interpretation of &lt;math&gt;\Diamond( p_1,\ldots,p_n)&lt;/math&gt; is “&lt;math&gt;(PA+p_1,\ldots,PA+p_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[tolerant sequence]] of theories”. 
 
Axioms (with &lt;math&gt;p,q&lt;/math&gt; standing for any formulas,  &lt;math&gt;\vec{r},\vec{s}&lt;/math&gt; for any sequences of formulas, and &lt;math&gt;\Diamond()&lt;/math&gt; identified with ⊤): 

1. All classical tautologies

2. &lt;math&gt;\Diamond (\vec{r},p,\vec{s})\rightarrow \Diamond (\vec{r}, p\wedge\neg q,\vec{s})\vee \Diamond (\vec{r}, q,\vec{s}) &lt;/math&gt;

3. &lt;math&gt;\Diamond (p)\rightarrow \Diamond (p\wedge \neg\Diamond (p)) &lt;/math&gt;

4. &lt;math&gt;\Diamond (\vec{r},p,\vec{s})\rightarrow \Diamond (\vec{r},\vec{s})&lt;/math&gt;

5. &lt;math&gt;\Diamond (\vec{r},p,\vec{s})\rightarrow \Diamond (\vec{r},p,p,\vec{s})&lt;/math&gt;

6. &lt;math&gt;\Diamond (p,\Diamond(\vec{r}))\rightarrow \Diamond (p\wedge\Diamond(\vec{r}))&lt;/math&gt;

7. &lt;math&gt;\Diamond (\vec{r},\Diamond(\vec{s}))\rightarrow \Diamond (\vec{r},\vec{s})&lt;/math&gt;

Rules inference: 

1. “From &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p\rightarrow q&lt;/math&gt; conclude &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;” 

2. “From &lt;math&gt;\neg p&lt;/math&gt; conclude &lt;math&gt;\neg \Diamond( p)&lt;/math&gt;”.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9275">In [[mathematics]], the '''inverse problem for Lagrangian mechanics''' is the problem of determining whether a given system of [[ordinary differential equation]]s can arise as the [[Euler&amp;ndash;Lagrange equation]]s for some [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] function.

There has been a great deal of activity in the study of this problem since the early 20th century. A notable advance in this field was a 1941 paper by the [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] [[Jesse Douglas]], in which he provided [[necessary and sufficient]] conditions for the problem to have a solution; these conditions are now known as the '''Helmholtz conditions''', after the [[Germany|German]] [[physicist]] [[Hermann von Helmholtz]].

==Background and statement of the problem==

The usual set-up of [[Lagrangian mechanics]] on ''n''-[[dimension]]al [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is as follows. Consider a [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] [[path (topology)|path]] ''u''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;''T'']&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. The '''action''' of the path ''u'', denoted ''S''(''u''), is given by
:&lt;math&gt;S(u) = \int_{0}^{T} L(t, u(t), \dot{u}(t)) \, \mathrm{d} t,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''L'' is a function of time, position and [[velocity]] known as the '''Lagrangian'''. The [[principle of least action]] states that, given an initial state ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and a final state ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the trajectory that the system determined by ''L'' will actually follow must be a [[minimum|minimizer]] of the action [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] ''S'' satisfying the boundary conditions ''u''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''(T)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, the [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]s (and hence minimizers) of ''S'' must satisfy the [[Euler&amp;ndash;Lagrange equation]]s for ''S'':

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{u}^{i}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial u^{i}} = 0 \quad \text{for } 1 \leq i \leq n,&lt;/math&gt;
where the upper indices ''i'' denote the components of ''u''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''u''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''u''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;).

In the classical case
:&lt;math&gt;T(\dot{u}) = \frac{1}{2} m | \dot{u} |^{2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V : [0, T] \times \mathbb{R}^{n} \to \mathbb{R},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L(t, u, \dot{u}) = T(\dot{u}) - V(t, u),&lt;/math&gt;
the Euler&amp;ndash;Lagrange equations are the second-order ordinary differential equations better known as [[Newton's laws of motion]]:
:&lt;math&gt;m \ddot{u}^{i} = - \frac{\partial V(t, u)}{\partial u^{i}} \quad \text{for } 1 \leq i \leq n,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{i.e. }m \ddot{u} = - \nabla_{u} V(t, u).&lt;/math&gt;

The '''inverse problem of Lagrangian mechanics''' is as follows: given a system of second-order ordinary differential equations
:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{u}^{i} = f^{i} (u^{j}, \dot{u}^{j}) \quad \text{for } 1 \leq i, j \leq n, \quad \mbox{(E)}&lt;/math&gt;
that holds for times 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''t''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''T'', does there exist a Lagrangian ''L''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;''T'']&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' for which these ordinary differential equations (E) are the Euler&amp;ndash;Lagrange equations? In general, this problem is posed not on Euclidean space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, but on an ''n''-dimensional [[manifold]] ''M'', and the Lagrangian is a function ''L''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;''T'']&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;T''M''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''', where T''M'' denotes the [[tangent bundle]] of ''M''.

==Douglas' theorem and the Helmholtz conditions==

To simplify the notation, let

:&lt;math&gt;v^{i} = \dot{u}^{i}&lt;/math&gt;

and define a collection of ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; functions Φ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{j}^{i} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} \frac{\partial f^{i}}{\partial v^{j}} - \frac{\partial f^{i}}{\partial u^{j}} - \frac{1}{4} \frac{\partial f^{i}}{\partial v^{k}} \frac{\partial f^{k}}{\partial v^{j}}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem.''' (Douglas 1941) There exists a Lagrangian ''L''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;''T'']&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;T''M''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' such that the equations (E) are its Euler&amp;ndash;Lagrange equations [[if and only if]] there exists a [[non-singular]] [[symmetric matrix]] ''g'' with entries ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; depending on both ''u'' and ''v'' satisfying the following three '''Helmholtz conditions''':

:&lt;math&gt;g \Phi = (g \Phi)^{\top}, \quad \mbox{(H1)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d} g_{ij}}{\mathrm{d} t} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial f^{k}}{\partial v^{i}} g_{kj} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial f^{k}}{\partial v^{j}} g_{ki} = 0 \mbox{ for } 1 \leq i, j \leq n, \quad \mbox{(H2)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial v^{k}} = \frac{\partial g_{ik}}{\partial v^{j}} \mbox{ for } 1 \leq i, j, k \leq n. \quad \mbox{(H3)}&lt;/math&gt;

(The [[Einstein summation convention]] is in use for the repeated indices.)

===Applying Douglas' theorem===

At first glance, solving the Helmholtz equations (H1)&amp;ndash;(H3) seems to be an extremely difficult task. Condition (H1) is the easiest to solve: it is always possible to find a ''g'' that satisfies (H1), and it alone will not imply that the Lagrangian is singular. Equation (H2) is a system of ordinary differential equations: [[Picard&amp;ndash;Lindelöf theorem|the usual theorems]] on the existence and uniqueness of solutions to ordinary differential equations imply that it is, ''in principle'', possible to solve (H2). Integration does not yield additional constants but instead first integrals of the system (E), so this step becomes difficult ''in practice'' unless (E) has enough explicit first integrals. In certain well-behaved cases (e.g. the [[geodesic flow]] for the [[canonical form|canonical]] [[connection (mathematics)|connection]] on a [[Lie group]]), this condition is satisfied.

The final and most difficult step is to solve equation (H3), called the ''closure conditions'' since (H3) is the condition that the [[differential form|differential 1-form]] ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[closed and exact differential forms|closed form]] for each ''i''. The reason why this is so daunting is that (H3) constitutes a large system of coupled partial differential equations: for ''n'' degrees of freedom, (H3) constitutes a system of

:&lt;math&gt;2 \left( \begin{matrix} n + 1 \\ 3 \end{matrix} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

partial differential equations in the 2''n'' independent variables that are the components ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''g'', where

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \begin{matrix} n \\ k \end{matrix} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

denotes the [[binomial coefficient]]. In order to construct the most general possible Lagrangian, one must solve this huge system!

Fortunately, there are some auxiliary conditions that can be imposed in order to help in solving the Helmholtz conditions. First, (H1) is a purely algebraic condition on the unknown matrix ''g''. Auxiliary algebraic conditions on ''g'' can be given as follows: define functions

:&amp;Psi;&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;

by

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi_{jk}^{i} = \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{\partial \Phi_{j}^{i}}{\partial v^{k}} - \frac{\partial \Phi_{k}^{i}}{\partial v^{j}} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

The auxiliary condition on ''g'' is then

:&lt;math&gt;g_{mi} \Psi_{jk}^{m} + g_{mk} \Psi_{ij}^{m} + g_{mj} \Psi_{ki}^{m} = 0 \mbox{ for } 1 \leq i, j \leq n. \quad \mbox{(A)}&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, the equations (H2) and (A) are just the first in an infinite hierarchy of similar algebraic conditions. In the case of a [[parallel connection]] (such as the canonical connection on a Lie group), the higher order conditions are always satisfied, so only (H2) and (A) are of interest. Note that (A) comprises

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \begin{matrix} n \\ 3 \end{matrix} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

conditions whereas (H1) comprises

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \begin{matrix} n \\ 2 \end{matrix} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

conditions. Thus, it is possible that (H1) and (A) together imply that the Lagrangian function is singular. As of 2006, there is no general theorem to circumvent this difficulty in arbitrary dimension, although certain special cases have been resolved.

A second avenue of attack is to see whether the system (E) admits a submersion onto a lower-dimensional system and to try to "lift" a Lagrangian for the lower-dimensional system up to the higher-dimensional one. This is not really an attempt to solve the Helmholtz conditions so much as it is an attempt to construct a Lagrangian and then show that its Euler&amp;ndash;Lagrange equations are indeed the system (E).

'''Julio Rey Pastor''' (14 August 1888 – 21 February 1962) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] mathematician and [[History of science|historian of science]].

== Biography ==
Julio Rey Pastor studied high school in his hometown, and began his studies in Sciences in Vitoria. He moved to the University of Saragossa, where he found a stimulating environment in mathematics.  [[Zoel García de Galdeano]], Professor of Analytical Geometry and Calculus, was the professor who most influenced Rey Pastor’s scientific work. He graduated with honors in 1908. Rey Pastor earned his [[doctorate]] from [[Complutense University of Madrid]] in 1909, under supervision of [[Eduardo Torroja Caballé]]. Between 1911 and 1914, he studied at the [[University of Berlin]] and the [[University of Göttingen]], under the supervision of [[Felix Klein]]. During that period, he also studied under the supervision of Professors [[Hermann Schwarz]], [[Friedrich Hermann Schottky]] (father of Walter Schottky, Nobel Prize in Physics in 1911), and [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]].&lt;ref&gt;Link to the Spanish Council of Scientific Research (CSIC): http://www.residencia.csic.es/jae/en/protagonistas/41_c.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

His report sent to the Junta para Ampliación de Estudios (JAE) allows us to assess the significance of his studies in Germany.  He especially liked Schwarz’s lectures on analytic functions and synthetic geometry, not only because of their innovations but also because Schwarz’s teaching method. In this report, Rey proposed the creation of a "seminar in mathematics to arouse the research spirit of our school children." His proposal was accepted and in 1915 the JAE created the Mathematics Laboratory and Seminar, an important institution for the development of research on this field in Spain.

:''From 1915, Julio Rey Pastor became a dominant figure in mathematics in Spain, and later Argentina. In that year the ''Junta'' created for him in Madrid the first mathematics research institute in Spain which was outside an university. There he started a research seminar, and contributed to the advance and modernization of mathematics research and teaching. He was also the author of a series of advanced mathematics [[textbook]]s which had a very considerable influence in the Iberian world….''&lt;ref name=ELO94&gt;E.L. Ortiz (1994) "Spain, Portugal and Ibero-America, 1780 — 1930", in ''Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences'', volume 2, page 1509, [[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] editor, [[Routledge]] {{ISBN|0-415-09239-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Undoubtedly, the creation of the laboratory was a result of Rey Pastor’s studies in Germany, and it was intended to overcome the isolation and individualism of the Spanish mathematicians. This laboratory, under the National Institute of Sciences, was first installed in the basement of the National Library, then moved to a modest apartment on Santa Teresa St., then to the building of the Center for Historical Studies and, finally, became part of the [[Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas]] (CSIC), renamed Instituto Jorge Juan de Matemáticas in 1939.

Rey Pastor’s scientific work involved research, textbooks, and articles for the general public. They reflected the changes that were taking place in mathematics. He was also interested in the history of science and, specifically, mathematics in Spain.

:''From 1921 Rey Pastor settled permanently in [[Argentina]]...His influence in Argentina was as important as it had been in Spain...In the mid-1930s he directed a substantial group of research students in Buenos Aires. His continued interest in the mathematics life of Spain created two parallel schools, on both sides of the Atlantic, working on similar research projects.''&lt;ref name=ELO94/&gt;

In 1951, he was appointed director of the Instituto Jorge Juan de Matemáticas in the CSIC. His plans in Spain included two projects: the creation, within the CSIC, of an Institute of Applied Mathematics, and the foundation of a Seminar on the History of Science at the university.

In 1954, he entered the Royal Spanish Academy, proposed by [[Gregorio Marañón]], and Francisco Javier Sánchez Cantón, and delivered an acceptance speech on the algebra of language. (He had become a member of the Academy of Sciences in Madrid in 1920, and of the Academy of Sciences in Buenos Aires in 1932).

Rey Pastor showed his passion for mathematics as a researcher, as promoter of new studies, and as creator of agencies and institutions that enhanced the development of mathematics in Spain. A [[lunar crater]] Faraday G was called ''Reypastor'' by [[Hugh Percy Wilkins]] and Antonio Paluzie-Borrell, mappers of Earth's Moon, but the designation was not adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://the-moon.wikispaces.com/Faraday Lunar Crater Faraday]: ″Faraday G was called Reypastor by Hugh Percy Wilkins and Antonio Paluzie-Borrell, but the IAU did not accept that name.″, from [http://www.the-moon wikispaces.com/Introduction The Moon Wiki]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, he went back to Argentina and only returned to Spain on the occasion of the entry of his disciple, [[Sixto Ríos]] into the Academy of Sciences, on June 21, 1961. In his speech, Rey Pastor recalled the process of creation of the laboratory and the support from the JAE.

Rey Pastor occupied a seat in the [[List of members of the Real Academia Española|Real Academia Española]] between 1953 and 1962. He was honored with a [[List of people on stamps of Spain|Spanish stamp]] in 2000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9992">'''Kaprekar's routine''' is an algorithm in [[recreational mathematics]] devised by the [[India]]n [[mathematician]] [[D. R. Kaprekar]] which produces a sequence of numbers which either converges to a constant value or results in a repeating cycle. The algorithm is as follows:

# Choose any [[natural number]] {{math|''n''}} in some base (usually [[decimal|base 10]]). This is the first number of the sequence.
# Create a new number {{math|''n′''}} by arranging the digits of {{math|''n''}} in descending order, and another new number {{math|''n″''}}  by arranging the digits of {{math|''n''}} in ascending order. These numbers may have leading zeros, which can be discarded (or alternatively, retained). Subtract {{math|''n′'' − ''n″''}}  to produce the next number of the sequence.
# Repeat step 2.

For example, if we start with 3524 then we get:

:5432 − 2345 = 3087
:8730 −  378 = 8352
:8532 − 2358 = 6174
:7641 − 1467 = 6174 (this value repeats indefinitely)

A sequence like this is sometimes called a Kaprekar sequence and the function {{math|K(''n'')}} = {{math|''n′'' − ''n″''}}  is the '''Kaprekar mapping'''.

Some numbers map to themselves: for instance if {{math|''n''}} = 0, then 0 − 0 = 0; if {{math|''n''}} = 495, then 954 − 459 = 495; if {{math|''n''}} = 6174, then 7641 − 1467 = 6174. These are the [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s of the Kaprekar mapping.&lt;ref name="A099009"&gt;{{OEIS|A099009}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the sequence reaches one of these numbers, it will repeat indefinitely.

All Kaprekar sequences will either reach one of these fixed points or will result in a repeating cycle. Either way, the end result is reached in a fairly small number of steps.

Note that the numbers {{math|''n′''}} and {{math|''n″''}} have the same digit sum and hence the same remainder modulo 9 (if we are using base 10). Therefore, each number in a Kaprekar sequence of base 10 numbers (other than possibly the first) is a multiple of 9. In the general case of base {{math|''b''}}, the numbers in the sequences will be multiples of {{math|''b'' − 1}}.

==Numbers of length four digits==

In 1949 D. R. Kaprekar discovered&lt;ref name=Kaprekar1955&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kaprekar DR|title=An Interesting Property of the Number 6174 | journal=[[Scripta Mathematica]]|volume=15|pages=244–245|year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; that if the above process is applied to [[decimal|base 10]] numbers of 4 digits, the resulting sequence will almost always converge to the value [[6174 (number)|6174]] in at most 8 iterations, except for a small set of initial numbers which converge instead to 0. The number 6174 is sometimes known as Kaprekar's constant.&lt;ref name="mathworld"&gt;{{MathWorld | urlname = KaprekarRoutine | title = Kaprekar Routine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Yutaka Nishiyama]], [http://plus.maths.org/issue38/features/nishiyama/index.html Mysterious number 6174]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaprekar1980&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kaprekar DR|title=On Kaprekar Numbers | journal=Journal of Recreational Mathematics|volume=13|issue=2|pages=81–82|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The set of numbers that converge to zero depends on whether leading zeros are discarded (the usual formulation) or are retained (as in Kaprekar's original formulation).

In the usual formulation, there are 77 four-digit numbers that converge to zero,&lt;ref&gt;{{OEIS|A069746}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example 2111. However, in Kaprekar's original formulation the leading zeros are retained, and only [[repdigit]]s such as 1111 or 2222 map to zero. This contrast is illustrated below:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;"
|- 
! discard leading zeros
! retain leading zeros
|- style="vertical-align: top;"
|
2111 − 1112 = 999&lt;br/&gt;
 999 −  999 = 0
|
2111 − 1112 = 0999&lt;br/&gt;
9990 − 0999 = 8991&lt;br/&gt;
9981 − 1899 = 8082&lt;br/&gt;
8820 − 0288 = 8532&lt;br/&gt;
8532 − 2358 = '''6174'''
|}

Below is a flowchart. Leading zeros are retained, however the only difference when leading zeros are discarded is that instead of 0999 connecting to 8991, we get 999 connecting to 0.

==Numbers of length three digits==

If the Kaprekar routine is applied to numbers of 3 digits in base 10, the resulting sequence will almost always converge to the value [[495 (number)|495]] in at most 6 iterations, except for a small set of initial numbers which converge instead to 0.&lt;ref name="mathworld"/&gt;

The set of numbers that converge to zero depends on whether leading zeros are discarded (the usual formulation) or are retained (as in Kaprekar's original formulation). In the usual formulation, there are 60 three-digit numbers that converge to zero,&lt;ref&gt;{{OEIS|A090429}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example 211. However, in Kaprekar's original formulation the leading zeros are retained, and only [[repdigit]]s such as 111 or 222 map to zero.

Below is a flowchart. Leading zeros are retained, however the only difference when leading zeros are discarded is that instead of 099 connecting to 891, we get 99 connecting to 0.

[[File:KaprekarRoutineFlowGraph495.svg|thumb|center|upright=3.4|Sequence of three digit Kaprekar transformations ending in 495]]

==Other digit lengths==
For digit lengths other than three or four (in base 10), the routine may terminate at one of several constant values or may enter one of several cycles instead, depending on the starting value of the sequence.&lt;ref name="mathworld" /&gt;

The following table is applicable when leading zeros are retained.[http://kaprekar.sourceforge.net/output/sample.php] If leading zeros are discarded, the only difference is that the 09→81→63→27→45 cycle for digit length 2 does not occur, because then 54 − 45 = 9 (instead of 09), and 9 − 9 = 0, so all 2-digit sequences will instead end in 0. When leading zeros are retained, only [[repdigit]]s will result in 0.

It can easily be shown that all numbers of the form 6174, 631764, 63317664, 6...333...17...666...4 (where the length of the "3" sequence and the length of the "6" sequence are the same) are fixed points of the Kaprekar mapping in base 10. Other such "families" also exist, for instance 495, 549945, 554999445, 5(n)499(n)4(n)5, where d(n) means n repetitions of the digit "d".&lt;ref name="A099009"/&gt;

The number of cycles increases rapidly with larger digit lengths, and all but a small handful of these cycles are of length three. For example, for 20-digit numbers in base 10, there are fourteen constants (cycles of length one) and ninety-six cycles of length greater than one, all but two of which are of length three. Odd digit lengths produce fewer different end results than even digit lengths.[http://kaprekar.sourceforge.net/output/sample2.php][http://kaprekar.sourceforge.net/output/numplay/numplay.php]

==Other bases==
Kaprekar sequences can also be calculated in bases other than 10. For instance, the table below is applicable to hexadecimal, and leading zeros are retained.[http://kaprekar.sourceforge.net/output/sample_hex.php] If leading zeros are discarded, the only difference is that the 0f→e1→c3→87 cycle for digit length 2 does not occur, because then 87 − 78 = f (instead of 0f), and f − f = 0, so all 2-digit sequences will instead end in 0. When leading zeros are retained, only [[repdigit]]s will result in 0.

Note that each number in a Kaprekar sequence in base 16 is a multiple of F (decimal 15 = 16−1).

In [[mathematics]], '''Knuth's up-arrow notation''' is a method of notation for [[Large number|very large]] [[Integer|integers]], introduced by [[Donald Knuth]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Knuth, Donald E.|year=1976|title=Mathematics and Computer Science: Coping with Finiteness|journal=Science|volume=194|issue=4271|pages=1235–1242|doi=10.1126/science.194.4271.1235|pmid=17797067}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to the [[Ackermann function]] and especially to the [[hyperoperation]] sequence. The idea is based on the fact that [[multiplication]] can be viewed as [[Iteration|iterated]] [[addition]] and [[exponentiation]] as iterated [[multiplication]]. Continuing in this manner leads to [[tetration]] (iterated exponentiation) and to the remainder of the hyperoperation sequence, which is commonly denoted using Knuth arrow notation. This notation allows for a simple description of numbers far larger than can be explicitly written out.

A single arrow means [[exponentiation]] (iterated multiplication); more than one arrow means iterating the operation associated with one fewer arrow.

For example:
* single arrow is iterated multiplication ([[exponentiation]])
::&lt;math&gt;2 \uparrow 4 = 2\times(2\times(2\times 2)) = 2^4 = 16&lt;/math&gt;
* double arrow is iterated exponentiation ([[tetration]])
::&lt;math&gt;2 \uparrow\uparrow 4 = 2 \uparrow (2 \uparrow (2 \uparrow 2) ) = 2^{2^{2^{2}}} = 65536&lt;/math&gt;
* triple arrow is iterated tetration ([[pentation]])

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
2 \uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 3
&amp;= 2 \uparrow\uparrow (2 \uparrow\uparrow 2 )\\ 
&amp;=2 \uparrow\uparrow(2 \uparrow 2)\\
&amp;=2 \uparrow\uparrow4\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The general definition of the notation (by [[Recursion (mathematics)|recursion]]) is as follows (for integer ''a'' and non-negative integers ''b'' and ''n''):
:&lt;math&gt;
  a\uparrow^n b=
   \begin{cases}
    a^b, &amp; \text{if }n=1; \\
    1, &amp; \text{if }n\ge 1\text{ and }b=0; \\
    a\uparrow^{n-1}(a\uparrow^{n}(b-1)), &amp; \text{otherwise }
   \end{cases}
 &lt;/math&gt;

Here, ↑&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; stands for ''n'' arrows, so for example
:&lt;math&gt;2 \uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 3 = 2\uparrow^4 3&lt;/math&gt;.

==Introduction==

The ordinary arithmetical operations of [[addition]], [[multiplication]], and [[exponentiation]] are naturally extended into a sequence of [[hyperoperations]] as follows.

[[Addition]] by a [[natural number]] is defined as iterated counting:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{matrix}
   a+b &amp; = &amp; a+\underbrace{1+1+\dots+1} \\
   &amp; &amp; b\mbox{ copies of }1
  \end{matrix} 
 &lt;/math&gt;
   
[[Multiplication]] by a [[natural number]] is defined as iterated [[addition]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{matrix}
   a\times b &amp; = &amp; \underbrace{a+a+\dots+a} \\
   &amp; &amp; b\mbox{ copies of }a
  \end{matrix} 
 &lt;/math&gt;

For example,

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{matrix}   3\times 4 &amp; = &amp; \underbrace{3+3+3+3} &amp; = &amp; 12\\
   &amp; &amp; 4\mbox{ copies of }3
  \end{matrix} 
 &lt;/math&gt;

[[Exponentiation]] for a natural power &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is defined as iterated multiplication, which Knuth denoted by a single up-arrow:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{matrix}
   a\uparrow b= a^b = &amp; \underbrace{a\times a\times\dots\times a}\\
   &amp; b\mbox{ copies of }a
  \end{matrix} 
 &lt;/math&gt;

For example,

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{matrix}
   4\uparrow 3= 4^3 = &amp; \underbrace{4\times 4\times 4} &amp; = &amp; 64\\
   &amp; 3\mbox{ copies of }4
  \end{matrix} 
 &lt;/math&gt;

To extend the sequence of operations beyond exponentiation, Knuth defined a “double arrow” [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]] to denote iterated exponentiation ([[tetration]]):

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{matrix}
   a\uparrow\uparrow b =&amp;  \underbrace{a^{a^{{}^{.\,^{.\,^{.\,^a}}}}}} &amp; 
   = &amp; \underbrace{a\uparrow (a\uparrow(\dots\uparrow a))} 
\\  
    &amp; b\mbox{ copies of }a
    &amp; &amp; b\mbox{ copies of }a
  \end{matrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;

For example,

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{matrix}
   4\uparrow\uparrow 3 = &amp; \underbrace{4^{4^4}} &amp; 
   = &amp; \underbrace{4\uparrow (4\uparrow 4)} &amp; = &amp; 4^{256} &amp; \approx &amp; 1.34078079\times 10^{154}&amp;
\\  
    &amp; 3\mbox{ copies of }4
    &amp; &amp;3\mbox{ copies of }4
  \end{matrix} 
 &lt;/math&gt;

Here and below evaluation is to take place from right to left, as Knuth's arrow operators (just like exponentiation) are defined to be [[Right associative operator|right-associative]].

According to this definition,
:&lt;math&gt;3\uparrow\uparrow 2=3^3=27 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3\uparrow\uparrow 3=3^{3^3}=3^{27}=7,625,597,484,987 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3\uparrow\uparrow 4=3^{3^{3^3}}=3^{3^{27}}=3^{7625597484987}\approx 1.2580143\times 10^{3638334640024}
 &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;3\uparrow\uparrow 5=3^{3^{3^{3^3}}}=3^{3^{3^{27}}}=3^{3^{7625597484987}}\approx 3^{1.2580143\times 10^{3638334640024}} &lt;/math&gt;
:etc.

This already leads to some fairly large numbers, but Knuth extended the notation. He went on to define a “triple arrow” operator for iterated tetration ([[pentation]]):

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{matrix}
   a\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow b= &amp;
    \underbrace{a_{}\uparrow\uparrow (a\uparrow\uparrow(\dots\uparrow\uparrow a))}\\
    &amp; b\mbox{ copies of }a
  \end{matrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;

followed by a “quadruple arrow“ operator for iterated pentation ([[hyperoperation|hexation]]):

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{matrix}
   a\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow b= &amp;
    \underbrace{a_{}\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow (a\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow(\dots\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow a))}\\
    &amp; b\mbox{ copies of }a
  \end{matrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;

and so on. The general rule is that an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-arrow operator expands into a right-associative series of (&lt;math&gt;n - 1&lt;/math&gt;)-arrow operators. Symbolically,

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{matrix}
   a\ \underbrace{\uparrow_{}\uparrow\!\!\dots\!\!\uparrow}_{n}\ b=
    \underbrace{a\ \underbrace{\uparrow\!\!\dots\!\!\uparrow}_{n-1}
    \ (a\ \underbrace{\uparrow_{}\!\!\dots\!\!\uparrow}_{n-1}
    \ (\dots
    \ \underbrace{\uparrow_{}\!\!\dots\!\!\uparrow}_{n-1}
    \ a))}_{b\text{ copies of }a}
  \end{matrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;

Examples:

:&lt;math&gt;3\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow2 = 3\uparrow\uparrow3 = 3^{3^3} = 3^{27}=7,625,597,484,987&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{matrix}
    3\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow3 = 3\uparrow\uparrow(3\uparrow\uparrow3) = 3\uparrow\uparrow(3\uparrow3\uparrow3) = &amp;
    \underbrace{3_{}\uparrow 3\uparrow\dots\uparrow 3} \\
   &amp; 3\uparrow3\uparrow3\mbox{ copies of }3
  \end{matrix}
  \begin{matrix}
   = &amp; \underbrace{3_{}\uparrow 3\uparrow\dots\uparrow 3} \\
   &amp; \mbox{7,625,597,484,987 copies of 3}
  \end{matrix}
  \begin{matrix}
   = &amp; \underbrace{3^{3^{3^{3^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{3}}}}}}}}} \\
   &amp; \mbox{7,625,597,484,987 copies of 3}
  \end{matrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;

The notation &lt;math&gt;a \uparrow^n b&lt;/math&gt; is commonly used to denote &lt;math&gt;a \uparrow\uparrow \dots \uparrow b&lt;/math&gt; with ''n'' arrows. In fact, &lt;math&gt;a \uparrow^n b&lt;/math&gt; is ''a'' [''n''+2] ''b'' with [[hyperoperation]]. For example, &lt;math&gt;39\uparrow\uparrow14&lt;/math&gt; can also be written as 39 [4] 14 (the "[4]" means [[tetration]]), but it is not equal to 39 [2] 14 = 39 × 14 = 546; similarly, &lt;math&gt;77 \uparrow^{77} 77&lt;/math&gt; is equal to 77 [79] 77,  instead of 77 [77] 77.

==Notation==
In expressions such as &lt;math&gt;a^b&lt;/math&gt;, the notation for exponentiation is usually to write the exponent &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; as a superscript to the base number &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. But many environments &amp;mdash; such as [[programming language]]s and plain-text [[e-mail]] &amp;mdash; do not support [[superscript]] typesetting. People have adopted the linear notation &lt;math&gt;a \uparrow b&lt;/math&gt; for such environments; the up-arrow suggests 'raising to the power of'. If the [[character set]] does not contain an up arrow, the [[caret]] (^) is used instead.

The superscript notation &lt;math&gt;a^b&lt;/math&gt; doesn't lend itself well to generalization, which explains why Knuth chose to work from the inline notation &lt;math&gt;a \uparrow b&lt;/math&gt; instead.

&lt;math&gt;a \uparrow^n b&lt;/math&gt; is a shorter alternative notation for n uparrows. Thus &lt;math&gt;a \uparrow^4 b = a \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow b&lt;/math&gt;.

===Writing out up-arrow notation in terms of powers===
Attempting to write &lt;math&gt;a \uparrow \uparrow b&lt;/math&gt; using the familiar superscript notation gives a power tower.

:For example: &lt;math&gt;a \uparrow \uparrow 4 = a \uparrow (a \uparrow (a \uparrow a)) = a^{a^{a^a}}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''b'' is a variable (or is too large), the power tower might be written using dots and a note indicating the height of the tower.

:&lt;math&gt;a \uparrow \uparrow b = \underbrace{a^{a^{.^{.^{.{a}}}}}}_{b}&lt;/math&gt;

Continuing with this notation, &lt;math&gt;a \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow b&lt;/math&gt; could be written with a stack of such power towers, each describing the size of the one above it.

:&lt;math&gt;a \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 4 = a \uparrow \uparrow (a \uparrow \uparrow (a \uparrow \uparrow a)) = 
  \underbrace{a^{a^{.^{.^{.{a}}}}}}_{ \underbrace{a^{a^{.^{.^{.{a}}}}}}_{ \underbrace{a^{a^{.^{.^{.{a}}}}}}_{a} }}&lt;/math&gt;

Again, if ''b'' is a variable or is too large, the stack might be written using dots and a note indicating its height.

:&lt;math&gt;a \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow b = 
  \left. \underbrace{a^{a^{.^{.^{.{a}}}}}}_{ \underbrace{a^{a^{.^{.^{.{a}}}}}}_{ \underbrace{\vdots}_{a} }} \right\} b&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;a \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow b&lt;/math&gt; might be written using several columns of such stacks of power towers, each column describing the number of power towers in the stack to its left:

:&lt;math&gt;a \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 4 = a \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow (a \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow (a \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow a)) = 
  \left.\left.\left. \underbrace{a^{a^{.^{.^{.{a}}}}}}_{ \underbrace{a^{a^{.^{.^{.{a}}}}}}_{ \underbrace{\vdots}_{a} }} \right\}
                     \underbrace{a^{a^{.^{.^{.{a}}}}}}_{ \underbrace{a^{a^{.^{.^{.{a}}}}}}_{ \underbrace{\vdots}_{a} }} \right\}
                     \underbrace{a^{a^{.^{.^{.{a}}}}}}_{ \underbrace{a^{a^{.^{.^{.{a}}}}}}_{ \underbrace{\vdots}_{a} }} \right\}
                     a&lt;/math&gt;

And more generally:

:&lt;math&gt;a \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow b = 
  \underbrace{
    \left.\left.\left. \underbrace{a^{a^{.^{.^{.{a}}}}}}_{ \underbrace{a^{a^{.^{.^{.{a}}}}}}_{ \underbrace{\vdots}_{a} }} \right\}
                       \underbrace{a^{a^{.^{.^{.{a}}}}}}_{ \underbrace{a^{a^{.^{.^{.{a}}}}}}_{ \underbrace{\vdots}_{a} }} \right\}
                       \cdots \right\}
                       a
  }_{b}&lt;/math&gt;

This might be carried out indefinitely to represent &lt;math&gt;a \uparrow^n b&lt;/math&gt; as iterated exponentiation of iterated exponentiation for any ''a'', ''n'' and ''b'' (although it clearly becomes rather cumbersome).

====Using tetration====

The [[tetration]] notation &lt;math&gt;^{b}a&lt;/math&gt; allows us to make these diagrams slightly simpler while still employing a geometric representation (we could call these ''tetration towers'').

: &lt;math&gt; a \uparrow \uparrow b = { }^{b}a&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; a \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow b = \underbrace{^{^{^{^{^{a}.}.}.}a}a}_{b}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; a \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow b = 
   \left. \underbrace{^{^{^{^{^{a}.}.}.}a}a}_{ \underbrace{^{^{^{^{^{a}.}.}.}a}a}_{ \underbrace{\vdots}_{a} }} \right\} b&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, as an example, the fourth Ackermann number &lt;math&gt;4 \uparrow^4 4&lt;/math&gt; could be represented as:
: &lt;math&gt;\underbrace{^{^{^{^{^{4}.}.}.}4}4}_{ \underbrace{^{^{^{^{^{4}.}.}.}4}4}_{ \underbrace{^{^{^{^{^{4}.}.}.}4}4}_{4} }} = 
        \underbrace{^{^{^{^{^{4}.}.}.}4}4}_{ \underbrace{^{^{^{^{^{4}.}.}.}4}4}_{ ^{^{^{4}4}4}4 }}&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==
Some numbers are so large that multiple arrows of Knuth's up-arrow notation become too cumbersome; then an ''n''-arrow operator  &lt;math&gt;\uparrow^n&lt;/math&gt; is useful (and also for descriptions with a variable number of arrows), or equivalently, [[hyper operator]]s.

Some numbers are so large that even that notation is not sufficient. The [[Conway chained arrow notation]] can then be used: a chain of three elements is equivalent with the other notations, but a chain of four or more is even more powerful.

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{matrix}
   a\uparrow^n b &amp; = &amp; a [n+2] b &amp; = &amp; a\to b\to n \\
   \mbox{(Knuth)} &amp; &amp; \mbox{(hyperoperation)} &amp; &amp; \mbox{(Conway)}
  \end{matrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;

It is generally suggested{{By whom|date=March 2015}} that Knuth's arrow should be used for smaller magnitude numbers, and the chained arrow or hyper operators for larger ones.

==Definition==

The up-arrow notation is formally defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
  a\uparrow^n b=
  \left\{
   \begin{matrix}
    a b, &amp; \mbox{if }n=0; \\
    1, &amp; \mbox{if }n\ge1\mbox{ and }b=0; \\
    a\uparrow^{n-1}(a\uparrow^n(b-1)), &amp; \mbox{otherwise }
   \end{matrix}
  \right.
 &lt;/math&gt;
for all integers &lt;math&gt;a, b, n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;b \ge 0, n \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;.

This definition takes [[multiplication]] as the basic operation &lt;math&gt;(a\uparrow^0 b = a b)&lt;/math&gt;, then yields [[exponentiation]] &lt;math&gt;(a\uparrow^1 b = a\uparrow b = a^b)&lt;/math&gt; as repeated multiplication, [[tetration]] &lt;math&gt;(a\uparrow^2 b = a\uparrow\uparrow b)&lt;/math&gt; as repeated exponentiation, etc. (This is equivalent to the [[Hyperoperation#Definition|hyperoperation sequence]] except it omits the two more-basic operations of [[Successor_function|successor]] and [[addition]], inclusion of which requires additional starting values that somewhat complicate the definition.)

All up-arrow operators (including normal exponentiation, &lt;math&gt;a \uparrow b&lt;/math&gt;) are defined to be [[Associative property#Notation for non-associative operations|right associative]], i.e. evaluated from right to left in an expression. 
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;a \uparrow b \uparrow c = a \uparrow (b \uparrow c)&lt;/math&gt; &amp;mdash;&amp;mdash; not &lt;math&gt;(a \uparrow b) \uparrow c&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;3\uparrow\uparrow 3=3^{3^3}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;3^{(3^3)}=3^{27}=7625597484987&lt;/math&gt; &amp;mdash;&amp;mdash; not &lt;math&gt;\left(3^3\right)^3=27^3=19683.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that due to right-associativity we have, for &lt;math&gt;b \ge 1, n\ge 1&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
a \uparrow^{n}b &amp; = &amp; a\uparrow^{n-1}a\uparrow^{n-1}\cdots a\uparrow^{n-1}a \ \ (\text{with }b \ a\text{'s}) \\
                &amp; = &amp; a\uparrow^{n-1}a\uparrow^{n-1}\cdots a\uparrow^{n-1}a\uparrow^{n-1}1 \ \ (\text{with }b \ a\text{'s}) \\
                &amp; = &amp; (a\uparrow^{n-1})^{b}1
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

where each &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; appears as a left operand of the arrow operator (which is significant because the arrow operators are not [[commutativity|commutative]]), and we have written &lt;math&gt;(a\uparrow ^m)^b&lt;/math&gt; for the ''b''th [[functional power]] of the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=a\uparrow ^m x&lt;/math&gt;. Because &lt;math&gt;(a\uparrow ^m)^0 n = n&lt;/math&gt;, the original definition can therefore be written more concisely as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
  a\uparrow^n b=
  \left\{
   \begin{matrix}
    a b, &amp; \mbox{if }n=0; \\
    (a\uparrow^{n-1})^b 1 &amp; \mbox{if }n\ge 1
   \end{matrix}
  \right.
 &lt;/math&gt;
for all integers &lt;math&gt;a, b, n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;b \ge 0, n \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Computing &lt;math&gt;2\uparrow^m n&lt;/math&gt; can be restated in terms of an infinite table.

Note that for 2 ≤ ''n'' ≤ 9 the numerical order of the numbers &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow^m n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[lexicographical order]] with ''m'' as the most significant number, so for the numbers of these 8 columns the numerical order is simply line-by-line. The same applies for the numbers in the 97 columns with 3 ≤ ''n'' ≤ 99, and if we start from ''m'' = 1 even for 3 ≤ ''n'' ≤ 9,999,999,999.

==Numeration systems based on the hyperoperation sequence==

[[Reuben Goodstein|R. L. Goodstein]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goodstein, R. L.|title=Transfinite ordinals in recursive number theory |jstor=2266486 |journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic |volume=12 |year=1947 |issue=4 |doi=10.2307/2266486 |pages=123–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a system of notation different from Knuth arrows, used the sequence of [[hyperoperation|hyperoperators]] here denoted by &lt;math&gt;( +, \ \times, \ \uparrow, \ \uparrow\uparrow, \ \dots)&lt;/math&gt; to create systems of numeration for the nonnegative integers.  Letting square brackets ([1], [2], [3], [4], ... ) denote the respective hyperoperators &lt;math&gt;( +, \ \times, \ \uparrow, \ \uparrow\uparrow, \ \dots)&lt;/math&gt;, the so-called ''complete hereditary representation'' of integer ''n'', at level ''k'' and base ''b'', can be expressed as follows using only the first ''k'' hyperoperators and using as digits only 0, 1, ..., ''b'' − 1, together with the base ''b'' itself:

* For 0 ≤ ''n'' ≤ ''b''-1, ''n'' is represented simply by the corresponding digit.
* For ''n'' &gt; ''b''-1, the representation of ''n'' is found recursively, first representing ''n'' in the form 
:''b'' [''k''] ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; [''k'' - 1] ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''-1&lt;/sub&gt; [''k'' - 2] ... [2] ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [1] ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
:where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are the largest integers satisfying (in turn)

:''b'' [''k''] ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''n''

:''b'' [''k''] ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; [''k'' - 1] ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k'' - 1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''n''

:...

:''b'' [''k''] ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; [''k'' - 1] ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k'' - 1&lt;/sub&gt; [''k'' - 2] ... [2] ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [1] ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''n''

:Any ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; exceeding ''b''-1 is then re-expressed in the same manner, and so on, repeating this procedure until the resulting form contains only the digits 0, 1, ..., ''b''-1, together with the base ''b''. 

The remainder of this section will use the superscripts to denote the hyperoperators.
 
Unnecessary parentheses can be avoided by giving higher-level operators higher precedence in the order of evaluation; thus,

level-1 representations have the form b [1] X, with ''X'' also of this form;

level-2 representations have the form b [2] X [1] Y, with ''X'',''Y'' also of this form;

level-3 representations have the form b [3] X [2] Y [1] Z, with ''X'',''Y'',''Z'' also of this form;

level-4 representations have the form b [4] X [3] Y [2] Z [1] W, with ''X'',''Y'',''Z'',''W'' also of this form;

and so on.  

Note that in this type of base-''b'' ''hereditary'' representation, the base itself appears in the expressions, as well as "digits" from the set {0, 1, ..., ''b''-1}. This compares to ''ordinary'' base-2 representation when the latter is written out in terms of the base ''b''; e.g., in ordinary base-2 notation, 6 = (110)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2 [3] 2 [2] 1 [1] 2 [3] 1 [2] 1 [1] 2 [3] 0 [2] 0, whereas the level-3 base-2 hereditary representation is 6 = 2 [3] (2 [3] 1 [2] 1 [1] 0) [2] 1 [1] (2 [3] 1 [2] 1 [1] 0). The hereditary representations can be abbreviated by omitting any instances of [1] 0, [2] 1, [3] 1, [4] 1, etc.;  for example, the above level-3 base-2 representation of 6 abbreviates to 2 [3] 2 [1] 2. 

Examples:
The unique base-2 representations of the number [[266 (number)|266]], at levels 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are as follows:

:Level 1: 266 = 2 [1] 2 [1] 2 [1] ... [1] 2 (with 133 2s)
:Level 2: 266 = 2 [2] (2 [2] (2 [2] (2 [2] 2 [2] 2 [2] 2 [2] 2 [1] 1)) [1] 1)
:Level 3: 266 = 2 [3] 2 [3] (2 [1] 1) [1] 2 [3] (2 [1] 1) [1] 2
:Level 4: 266 = 2 [4] (2 [1] 1) [3] 2 [1] 2 [4] 2 [2] 2 [1] 2
:Level 5: 266 = 2 [5] 2 [4] 2 [1] 2 [5] 2 [2] 2 [1] 2

[[File:Pythagorean proof (1).svg|300px|right|thumb|An example of "beauty in method"—a simple and elegant proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].]]

'''Mathematical beauty''' describes the notion that some [[mathematician]]s may derive [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] pleasure from their work, and from [[mathematics]] in general. They express this pleasure by describing mathematics (or, at least, some aspect of mathematics) as ''beautiful''. Mathematicians describe mathematics as an [[art]] form or, at a minimum, as a [[creativity|creative activity]]. Comparisons are often made with [[music]] and [[poetry]].

[[Bertrand Russell]] expressed his sense of mathematical beauty in these words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|authorlink=Bertrand Russell|title=Mysticism and Logic: And Other Essays|publisher=[[Longman]]|year=1919|page=60|chapter=The Study of Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zwMQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=Mathematics+rightly+viewed+possesses+not+only+truth+but+supreme+beauty+a+beauty+cold+and+austere+like+that+of+sculpture+without+appeal+to+any+part+of+our+weaker+nature+without+the+gorgeous+trappings+inauthor:Russell|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Paul Erdős]] expressed his views on the [[ineffability]] of mathematics when he said, "Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] beautiful. If you don't see why, someone can't tell you. I ''know'' numbers are beautiful. If they aren't beautiful, nothing is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Devlin|first=Keith|title=The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved And Why Numbers Are Like Gossip|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|year=2000|page=140|chapter=Do Mathematicians Have Different Brains?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJdmfYEaLG4C|accessdate=2008-08-22|isbn=978-0-465-01619-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beauty in method==
Mathematicians describe an especially pleasing method of [[Mathematical proof|proof]] as ''[[Elegance|elegant]]''. Depending on context, this may mean:

* A proof that uses a minimum of additional assumptions or previous results.
* A proof that is unusually succinct.
* A proof that derives a result in a surprising way (e.g., from an apparently unrelated [[theorem]] or collection of theorems).
* A proof that is based on new and original insights.
* A method of proof that can be easily generalized to solve a family of similar problems.

In the search for an elegant proof, mathematicians often look for different independent ways to prove a result—the first proof that is found may not be the best. The theorem for which the greatest number of different proofs have been discovered is possibly the [[Pythagorean theorem]], with hundreds of proofs having been published.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elisha Scott Loomis]] published over 360 proofs in his book Pythagorean Proposition ({{isbn|0-873-53036-5}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Another theorem that has been proved in many different ways is the theorem of [[quadratic reciprocity]]—[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] alone published eight different proofs of this theorem.

Conversely, results that are logically correct but involve laborious calculations, over-elaborate methods, very conventional approaches, or that rely on a large number of particularly powerful [[axiom]]s or previous results are not usually considered to be elegant, and may be called ''ugly'' or ''clumsy''.

==Beauty in results==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Fermat's last theorem]] --&gt;
[[File:EulerIdentity2.svg|thumb|right|Starting at ''e''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, travelling at the velocity ''i'' relative to one's position for the length of time π, and adding 1, one arrives at 0. (The diagram is an [[Argand diagram]])]]
Some mathematicians{{sfnp|Rota|1997|p=173}} see beauty in mathematical results that establish connections between two areas of mathematics that at first sight appear to be unrelated. These results are often described as ''deep''.

While it is difficult to find universal agreement on whether a result is deep, some examples are often cited. One is [[Euler's identity]]:&lt;ref name=Gallagher2014&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=James|title=Mathematics: Why the brain sees maths as beauty|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26151062|accessdate=13 February 2014|newspaper=BBC News online|date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math display=block&gt;\displaystyle e^{i \pi} +1 = 0\, .&lt;/math&gt;

This is a special case of [[Euler's formula]], which the physicist [[Richard Feynman]] called "our jewel" and "the most remarkable formula in mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard P.|last= Feynman|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics |volume=I|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1977|isbn=0-201-02010-6|pages=22–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern examples include the [[modularity theorem]], which establishes an important connection between [[elliptic curve]]s and [[modular form]]s (work on which led to the awarding of the [[Wolf Prize]] to [[Andrew Wiles]] and [[Robert Langlands]]), and "[[monstrous moonshine]]", which connects the [[Monster group]] to [[modular function]]s via [[string theory]] for which [[Richard Borcherds]] was awarded the [[Fields Medal]].

Other examples of deep results include unexpected insights into mathematical structures. For example, Gauss's [[Theorema Egregium]] is a deep theorem which relates a local phenomenon ([[curvature]]) to a global phenomenon ([[area]]) in a surprising way. In particular, the area of a triangle on a curved surface is proportional to the excess of the triangle and the proportionality is curvature. Another example is the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] (and its vector versions including [[Green's theorem]] and [[Stokes' theorem]]).

The opposite of ''deep'' is ''trivial''. A trivial theorem may be a result that can be derived in an obvious and straightforward way from other known results, or which applies only to a specific set of particular objects such as the [[empty set]]. Sometimes, however, a statement of a theorem can be original enough to be considered deep, even though its proof is fairly obvious.

In his ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'', [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] suggests that a beautiful proof or result possesses "inevitability", "unexpectedness", and "economy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Mathematician's Apology|author=Hardy, G.H. | chapter = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gian-Carlo Rota|Rota]], however, disagrees with unexpectedness as a sufficient condition for beauty and proposes a counterexample:
{{quote|A great many theorems of mathematics, when first published, appear to be surprising; thus for example some twenty years ago [from 1977] the proof of the existence of [[Exotic sphere|non-equivalent differentiable structures]] on spheres of high dimension was thought to be surprising, but it did not occur to anyone to call such a fact beautiful, then or now.{{sfnp|Rota|1997|p=172}} }}
Perhaps ironically, Monastyrsky writes:
{{quote|It is very difficult to find an analogous invention in the past to [[Milnor]]'s beautiful construction of the different differential structures on the seven-dimensional sphere... The original proof of Milnor was not very constructive, but later E. Briscorn showed that these differential structures can be described in an extremely explicit and beautiful form.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last = Monastyrsky|title=Some Trends in Modern Mathematics and the Fields Medal|year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This disagreement illustrates both the subjective nature of mathematical beauty and its connection with mathematical results: in this case, not only the existence of exotic spheres, but also a particular realization of them.

==Beauty in experience==
[[File:Compound of five cubes.png|thumb|222px|A "cold and austere beauty" has been attributed to the [[compound of five cubes]]]]
{{tone|section|date=March 2013}}
Interest in [[pure mathematics]] separate from [[Empirical research|empirical]] study has been part of the experience [[History of mathematics|of various civilizations]], including that of the [[Greek mathematics|ancient Greeks]], who "did mathematics for the beauty of it".&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetic pleasure that [[mathematical physicist]]s tend to experience in Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]] has been attributed (by [[Paul Dirac]], among others) to its "great mathematical beauty".&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; The beauty of mathematics is experienced when the [[reality|physical reality]] of objects are represented by [[mathematical models]]. [[Group theory]], developed in the early 1800s for the sole purpose of solving [[polynomial]] equations, became a fruitful way of categorizing [[elementary particle]]s—the building blocks of matter. Similarly, the study of [[knot theory|knots]] provides important insights into [[string theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]].

Some believe that in order to appreciate mathematics, one must engage in doing mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=George|title=Mathematics Is Not a Spectator Sport|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|year=2005|chapter=Preface|isbn=0-387-25528-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=psFwdN6V6icC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;dq=there+is+nothing+in+the+world+of+mathematics+that+corresponds+to+an+audience+in+a+concert+hall,+where+the+passive+listen+to+the+active.+Happily,+mathematicians+are+all+doers,+not+spectators.|accessdate=2008-08-22|quote="...there is nothing in the world of mathematics that corresponds to an audience in a concert hall, where the passive listen to the active. Happily, mathematicians are all ''doers'', not spectators.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are some teachers that encourage [[student engagement]] by teaching mathematics in a kinesthetic way (see [[kinesthetic learning]]). For example, [[Math Circle]] is an afterschool enrichment program where students do mathematics through games and activities; in a general Math Circle lesson, students use pattern finding, observation, and exploration to make their own mathematical discoveries. For example, mathematical beauty arises in a Math Circle activity on [[symmetry]] designed for 2nd and 3rd graders. In this activity, students create their own snowflakes by folding a square piece of paper and cutting out designs of their choice along the edges of the folded paper. When the paper is unfolded, a symmetrical design reveals itself. In a day to day elementary school mathematics class, symmetry can be presented as such in an artistic manner where students see aesthetically pleasing results in mathematics.

Some teachers prefer to use [[mathematical manipulatives]] to present mathematics in an aesthetically pleasing way. Examples of a manipulative include [[algebra tiles]], [[cuisenaire rods]], and [[pattern blocks]]. For example, one can teach the method of [[completing the square]] by using algebra tiles. Cuisenaire rods can be used to teach fractions, and pattern blocks can be used to teach geometry. Using mathematical manipulatives helps students gain a conceptual understanding that might not be seen immediately in written mathematical formulas.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, E. (1989). Effects of Manipulative Materials in Mathematics Instruction. Journal for Research in Mathematics Education, 20, 498–505.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another example involves [[origami]]. Origami, the art of paper folding, has aesthetic qualities and many mathematical connections. One can study the [[mathematics of paper folding]] by observing the [[crease pattern]] on unfolded origami pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Hull, Thomas. "Project Origami: Activities for Exploring Mathematics". Taylor &amp; Francis, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Combinatorics]] (the study of counting) has artistic representations that some find mathematically beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;Brualdi, Richard. "Introductory Combinatorics." Pearson, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many visual examples that illustrate combinatorial concepts. Here are some topics and objects seen in combinatorics courses with visual representations:
* [[Four color theorem]]
* [[Young tableau]]
* [[Permutohedron]]
* [[Graph theory]]
* [[Partition of a set]]

==Beauty and philosophy==
Some mathematicians are of the opinion that the doing of mathematics is closer to discovery than invention, for example:
{{quote|There is no scientific discoverer, no poet, no painter, no musician, who will not tell you that he found ready made his discovery or poem or picture – that it came to him from outside, and that he did not consciously create it from within.
|[[William Kingdon Clifford]], from a lecture to the Royal Institution titled "Some of the conditions of mental development"}}
These mathematicians believe that the detailed and precise results of mathematics may be reasonably taken to be true without any dependence on the universe in which we live. For example, they would argue that the theory of the [[natural numbers]] is fundamentally valid, in a way that does not require any specific context. Some mathematicians have extrapolated this viewpoint that mathematical beauty is truth further, in some cases becoming [[mysticism]].

[[Pythagoras#Mathematics|Pythagorean mathematicians]] believed in the literal reality of numbers. The discovery of the existence of [[irrational number]]s was a shock to them, since they considered the existence of numbers not expressible as the ratio of two natural numbers to be a flaw in nature (the Pythagorean [[world view]] did not contemplate the [[Limit of a sequence|limits of infinite sequences]] of ratios of natural numbers—the modern notion of a [[real number]]). From a modern perspective, their mystical approach to numbers may be viewed as [[numerology]].

In [[Plato]]'s philosophy there were two worlds, the physical one in which we live and another abstract world which contained unchanging truth, including mathematics. He believed that the physical world was a mere reflection of the more perfect abstract world.

[[Hungary|Hungarian]] mathematician [[Paul Erdős]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Schechter, Bruce | title=My brain is open: The mathematical journeys of Paul Erdős | publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | location=New York | year=2000 | pages=70–71 | isbn = 0-684-85980-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; spoke of an imaginary book, in which God has written down all the most beautiful mathematical proofs. When Erdős wanted to express particular appreciation of a proof, he would exclaim "This one's from The Book!"

Twentieth-century French philosopher [[Alain Badiou]] claims that [[ontology]] is mathematics. Badiou also believes in deep connections between mathematics, poetry and philosophy.

In some cases, natural philosophers and other scientists who have made extensive use of mathematics have made leaps of inference between beauty and physical truth in ways that turned out to be erroneous. For example, at one stage in his life, [[Johannes Kepler]] believed that the proportions of the orbits of the then-known planets in the [[Solar System]] have been arranged by [[God]] to correspond to a concentric arrangement of the five [[Platonic solid]]s, each orbit lying on the [[Circumscribed sphere|circumsphere]] of one [[polyhedron]] and the [[Inscribed sphere|insphere]] of another. As there are exactly five Platonic solids, Kepler's hypothesis could only accommodate six planetary orbits and was disproved by the subsequent discovery of [[Uranus]].

==Beauty and mathematical information theory==
In the 1970s, [[Abraham Moles]] and [[Frieder Nake]] analyzed links between beauty, [[information processing]], and [[information theory]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Moles: ''Théorie de l'information et perception esthétique'', Paris, Denoël, 1973 ([[Information Theory]] and aesthetical perception)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F Nake (1974). Ästhetik als Informationsverarbeitung. ([[Aesthetics]] as information processing). Grundlagen und Anwendungen der Informatik im Bereich ästhetischer Produktion und Kritik. Springer, 1974, {{isbn|3-211-81216-4}}, {{isbn|978-3-211-81216-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] formulated a mathematical theory of observer-dependent subjective beauty based on [[algorithmic information theory]]: the most beautiful objects among subjectively comparable objects have short [[algorithmic information theory|algorithmic]] descriptions (i.e., [[Kolmogorov complexity]]) relative to what the observer already knows.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schmidhuber. [[Low-complexity art]]. [[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]], Journal of the International Society for the Arts, Sciences, and Technology ([[Leonardo, The International Society of the Arts, Sciences and Technology|Leonardo/ISAST]]), 30(2):97–103, 1997. {{doi|10.2307/1576418}}. {{JSTOR|1576418}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

The latter corresponds to the [[first derivative]] of subjectively perceived beauty:
the observer continually tries to improve the [[predictability]] and [[Data compression|compressibility]] of the observations by discovering regularities such as repetitions and [[symmetries]] and [[fractal]] [[self-similarity]]. Whenever the observer's learning process (possibly a predictive artificial [[neural network]]) leads to improved data compression such that the observation sequence can be described by fewer [[bit]]s than before, the temporary interestingness of the data corresponds to the compression progress, and is proportional to the observer's internal curiosity reward.&lt;ref&gt;.J.

===Music===
Examples of the use of mathematics in music include the [[stochastic music]] of [[Iannis Xenakis]], [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci]] in [[Tool (band)|Tool]]'s [[Lateralus (song)|Lateralus]], counterpoint of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[polyrhythm]]ic structures (as in [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''), the [[Metric modulation]] of [[Elliott Carter]], [[permutation]] theory in [[serialism]] beginning with [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and application of Shepard tones in [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]'s ''[[Hymnen]]''.

===Visual arts===
[[File:Della Pittura Alberti perspective pillars on grid.jpg|thumb|Diagram from [[Leon Battista Alberti]]'s 1435 ''[[Della Pittura]]'', with pillars in [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] on a grid]]

Examples of the use of mathematics in the visual arts include applications of [[chaos theory]] and [[fractal]] [[geometry]] to [[digital art|computer-generated art]], [[symmetry]] studies of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[projective geometry|projective geometries]] in development of the [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] theory of [[Renaissance]] art, [[grid (page layout)|grids]] in [[Op art]], optical geometry in the [[camera obscura]] of [[Giambattista della Porta]], and multiple perspective in analytic [[cubism]] and [[futurism]].

The Dutch graphic designer [[M. C. Escher]] created mathematically inspired [[woodcut]]s, [[lithograph]]s, and [[mezzotint]]s. These feature impossible constructions, explorations of [[infinity]], [[architecture]], visual [[paradox]]es and [[tessellation]]s. British constructionist artist [[John Ernest]] created reliefs and paintings inspired by group theory.&lt;ref&gt;John Ernest's use of mathematics and especially group theory in his art works is analysed in ''John Ernest, A Mathematical Artist'' by Paul Ernest in ''Philosophy of Mathematics Education Journal'', No. 24 Dec. 2009 (Special Issue on Mathematics and Art): http://people.exeter.ac.uk/PErnest/pome24/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other British artists of the constructionist and systems schools also draw on mathematics models and structures as a source of inspiration, including [[Anthony Hill (artist)|Anthony Hill]] and [[Peter Lowe (artist)|Peter Lowe]]. Computer-generated art is based on mathematical [[algorithm]]s.

'''Maurice Fréchet''' ({{IPA-fr|moʁis ʁəne fʁeʃɛ|lang}}; 2 September 1878 – 4 June 1973) was a French mathematician. He made major contributions to the [[topology]] of point sets and introduced the entire concept of [[metric space]]s. He also made several important contributions to the field of statistics and [[probability]], as well as [[calculus]]. His dissertation opened the entire field of [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]s on [[metric spaces]] and introduced the notion of [[compactness]]. Independently of [[Frigyes Riesz|Riesz]], he discovered the [[Riesz representation theorem|representation theorem]] in the space of [[Lebesgue]] square integrable [[Function (mathematics)|functions]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
He was born to a [[Protestant]] family in [[Maligny, Yonne]] to Jacques and Zoé Fréchet. At the time of his birth, his father was a director of a Protestant orphanage in Maligny and was later in his youth appointed a head of a Protestant school. However, the newly established [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] was not sympathetic to religious education and so the laws were enacted requiring all education to be secular. As a result, his father lost his job. To generate some income his mother set up a boarding house for foreigners in Paris. His father was able later to obtain another teaching position within the secular system – it was not a job of a headship, however, and the family could not expect as high standards as they might have otherwise.

Maurice attended the secondary school [[Lycée Buffon]] in Paris where he was taught mathematics by [[Jacques Hadamard]]. Hadamard recognised the potential of young Maurice and decided to tutor him on an individual basis. After Hadamard moved to the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1894, Hadamard continuously wrote to Fréchet, setting him mathematical problems and harshly criticising his errors. Much later Fréchet admitted that the problems caused him to live in a continual fear of not being able to solve some of them, even though he was very grateful for the special relationship with Hadamard he was privileged to enjoy.

After completing high-school Fréchet was required to enroll in the military service. This is the time when he was deciding whether to study mathematics or physics – he chose mathematics out of dislike of chemistry classes he would have had to take otherwise. Thus in 1900 he enrolled to [[École Normale Supérieure]] to study mathematics.

He started publishing quite early, having published four papers in 1903. He also published some of his early papers in the [[American Mathematical Society]] due to his contact with American mathematicians in Paris—particularly [[Edwin Bidwell Wilson|Edwin Wilson]].

===Middle life===
Fréchet served at many different institutions during his academic career. From 1907–1908 he served as a professor of mathematics at the Lycée in [[Besançon]], then moved in 1908 to the Lycée in [[Nantes]] to stay there for a year. After that he served at the [[University of Poitiers]] between 1910–1919.

He married in 1908 to Suzanne Carrive (1881-1945) and had four children: Hélène, Henri, Denise and Alain.

===First World War===
Fréchet was planning to spend a year in the United States at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] but his plan was disrupted when the [[First World War]] broke out in 1914. He was mobilised on 4 August the same year. Because of his diverse language skills, gained when his mother ran the establishment for foreigners, he served as an interpreter for the [[British Army]]. However, this was not a safe job; he spent two and a half years very near to or at the front. French egalitarian ideals caused many academics to be mobilised. They served in the trenches and many of them were lost during the war. It is remarkable that during his service in the war, he still managed to produce cutting edge mathematical papers frequently, despite having little time to devote to mathematics.

===After the war===
After the end of the war, Fréchet was chosen to go to [[Strasbourg]] to help with the reestablishment of the [[University of Strasbourg|university]]. He served as a professor of higher analysis and Director of the Mathematics Institute. Despite being burdened with administrative work, he was again able to produce a large amount of high quality research.

In 1928 Fréchet decided to move back to Paris, thanks to encouragement from [[Émile Borel|Borel]], who was then Chair in the Calculus of Probabilities and Mathematical Physics at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. Fréchet briefly held a position of lecturer at the Sorbonne's [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and from 1928 was a Professor (without a Chair). Fréchet was promoted to [[tenured]] Chair of General Mathematics in 1933 and to Chair of Differential and Integral Calculus in 1935. In 1941 Fréchet succeeded Borel as Chair in the Calculus of Probabilities and Mathematical Physics, a position Fréchet held until he retired in 1949. From 1928 to 1935 Fréchet was also put in charge of lectures&lt;!-- not clear exactly what this means, but it's what the source says--&gt; at the [[École Normale Supérieure]]; in this latter capacity Fréchet was able to direct a significant number of young mathematicians toward research in probability, including Doeblin, Fortet, Loeve, and Ville.&lt;ref name="HeydeSeneta2001"&gt;{{cite book|editors=C.C. Heyde and E. Seneta|title=Statisticians of the Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6DD1FKq6fFoC&amp;pg=PA332|year=2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-95329-8|page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his major achievements, Fréchet was not overly appreciated in France. As an illustration, while being nominated numerous times, he was not elected a member of the [[Academy of Sciences]] until the age of 78.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}. In 1929 he became foreign member of the Polish Academy of Science and Arts and in 1950 foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00000286 |title=M.R. Fréchet (1878 - 1973) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fréchet was an [[Esperantist]], publishing some papers and articles in that constructed language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.numdam.org/ARCHIVE/CM/CM_1954-1956__12_/CM_1954-1956__12__81_0/CM_1954-1956__12__81_0.pdf La kanonaj formoj de la 2, 3, 4-dimensiaj paraanalitikaj funkcioj {{eo icon}}&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as president of the ''Internacia Scienca Asocio Esperantista'' ("International Scientific Esperantist Association") from 1950–53.&lt;ref&gt;[[:eo:Maurice René Fréchet|from the Esperanto Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main works==
His first major work was his outstanding 1906 PhD thesis ''Sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel'', on the calculus of functionals. Here Fréchet introduced the concept of a [[metric space]], although the name is due to [[Felix Hausdorff|Hausdorff]]. Fréchet's level of abstraction is similar to that in [[group theory]], proving theorems within a carefully chosen axiomatic system which can then be applied to a large array of particular cases. 

Here is a list of his most important works, in chronological order:
* ''Sur les opérations linéaires I-III, 1904–1907 (On linear operators)
* ''Les Espaces abstraits'', 1928 (Abstract spaces)
* ''Recherches théoriques modernes sur la théorie des probabilités'', 1937–1938 (Modern theoretical research in the theory of probability)
* ''Les Probabilités associées à un système d'événements compatibles et dépendants'', 1939–1943 (Probabilities Associated with a System of Compatible and Dependent Events)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kaplansky, Irving|authorlink=Irving Kaplansky|title=''Les Probablititês Associées à un Système d'Événements Compatibles et Dépendants ; I. Événements en Nombre Fini Fixe'' by Maurice Fréchet|journal=Bull. Amer. Math.

* ''Pages choisies d'analyse générale'', 1953 (Selected Pages of General Analysis)
* ''Les Mathématiques et le concret'', 1955 (Mathematics and the concrete)

Fréchet also developed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Maurice R. |last=Fréchet |year=1941 |title=Sur la loi de répartition de certaines grandeurs géographiques  |language=fr|journal=Journal de la Société de Statistiques de Paris |volume=82 |issue= |pages=114–122 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ideas from the article ''Deux types fondamentaux de distribution statistique''&lt;ref&gt;Jaromír Korčák (1938): Deux types fondamentaux de distribution statistique. Prague, Comité d’organisation, Bull. de l'Institut International de Statistique, vol. 3, pp. 295–299.&lt;/ref&gt; (1938; an English translation ''The Two Fundamental Types of Statistical Distribution'') of Czech [[geographer]], [[demographer]] and statistician [[Jaromír Korčák]].

Fréchet is sometimes credited with the introduction of what is now known as the [[Cramér–Rao bound]], but Fréchet's 1940s lecture notes on the topic appear to have been lost.&lt;ref name="NielsenBhatia2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frank Nielsen|author2=Rajendra Bhatia|title=Matrix Information Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MAhygTspBU8C&amp;pg=PA248|year=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-30232-9|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

In 1908 he married Suzanne Carrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7542">[[File:Maxima of a point set.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The five red points are the maxima of the set of all the red and yellow points. The shaded regions show the points dominated by each of the five maxima.]]
In [[computational geometry]], a point {{mvar|p}} in a [[finite set]] of points {{mvar|S}} is said to be ''maximal'' or ''non-dominated'' if there is no other point {{mvar|q}} in {{mvar|S}} whose coordinates are all greater than or equal to the corresponding coordinates of {{mvar|p}}. The '''maxima of a point set''' {{mvar|S}} are all the maximal points of {{mvar|S}}.
The problem of finding all maximal points, sometimes called the '''problem of the maxima''' or '''maxima set problem''', has been studied as a variant of the [[convex hull]] and [[orthogonal convex hull]] problems. It is equivalent to finding the [[Pareto frontier]] of a collection of points, and was called the '''floating-currency problem''' by [[Herbert Freeman]] based on an application involving comparing the relative wealth of individuals with different holdings of multiple currencies.&lt;ref name="ps"&gt;{{citation

==Two dimensions==
For points in two dimensions, this problem can be solved in time {{math|''O''(''n'' log ''n'')}} by an algorithm that performs the following steps:&lt;ref name="ps"/&gt;&lt;ref name="klp"/&gt;
*Sort the points in one of the coordinate dimensions (the {{mvar|x}}-coordinate, say)
*For each point, in decreasing order by {{mvar|x}}-coordinate, test whether its {{mvar|y}}-coordinate is greater than the maximum {{mvar|y}}-coordinate of any previously processed point. (For the first point, this is [[vacuous truth|vacuously true]]). If it is, output the point as one of the maximal points, and remember its {{mvar|y}}-coordinate as the greatest seen so far.

If the coordinates of the points are assumed to be [[integer]]s, this can be sped up using [[integer sorting]] algorithms, to have the same asymptotic running time as the sorting algorithms.&lt;ref name="ko"&gt;{{citation

==Three dimensions==
For points in three dimensions, it is again possible to find the maximal points in time {{math|''O''(''n'' log ''n'')}} using an algorithm similar to the two-dimensional one that performs the following steps:
*Sort the points in one of the coordinate dimensions (the {{mvar|x}}-coordinate, say)
*For each point, in decreasing order by {{mvar|x}}-coordinate, test whether its projection onto the {{mvar|yz}} plane is maximal among the set of projections of the set of points processed so far. If it is, output the point as one of the maximal points, and remember its {{mvar|y}}-coordinate as the greatest seen so far.
This method reduces the problem of computing the maximal points of a static three-dimensional point set to one of maintaining the maximal points of a dynamic two-dimensional point set.
The two-dimensional subproblem can be solved efficiently by using a [[balanced binary search tree]] to maintain the set of maxima of a dynamic point set.
Using this data structure, it is possible to test whether a new point is dominated by the existing points, to find and remove the previously-undominated points that are dominated by a new point, and to add a new point to the set of maximal points, in logarithmic time per point. The number of search tree operations is linear over the course of the algorithm, so the total time is {{math|''O''(''n'' log ''n'')}}.&lt;ref name="ps"/&gt;&lt;ref name="klp"&gt;{{citation

For points with integer coordinates the first part of the algorithm, sorting the points, can again be sped up by integer sorting. If the points are sorted separately by all three of their dimensions, the range of values of their coordinates can be reduced to the range from {{math|1}} to {{mvar|n}} without changing the relative order of any two coordinates and without changing the identities of the maximal points. After this reduction in the coordinate space, the problem of maintaining a dynamic two-dimensional set of maximal points may be solved by using a [[van Emde Boas tree]] in place of the balanced binary search tree. These changes to the algorithm speed up its running time to {{math|''O''(''n'' log log ''n'')}}.&lt;ref name="ko"/&gt;

In [[computing]], '''NaN''', standing for '''not a number''', is a numeric [[data type]] value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in [[floating point|floating-point]] calculations. Systematic use of NaNs was introduced by the [[IEEE 754]] floating-point standard in 1985, along with the representation of other non-finite quantities like [[Infinity|infinities]].

Two separate kinds of NaNs are provided, termed ''quiet NaNs'' and ''signaling NaNs''.  Quiet NaNs are used to propagate errors resulting from invalid operations or values, whereas signaling NaNs can support advanced features such as mixing numerical and [[symbolic computation]] or other extensions to basic floating-point arithmetic.  For example, [[Indeterminate form|0/0]] is undefined as a [[real number]], and so represented by NaN; the square root of a negative number is [[imaginary number|imaginary]], and thus not representable as a real floating-point number, and so is represented by NaN; and NaNs may be used to represent missing values in computations.&lt;ref name=idl&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowman|first=Kenneth|date=2006|title=An introduction to programming with IDL: Interactive Data Language|publisher=Academic Press|page=26|isbn=978-0-12-088559-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Press|first1=William H.|last2=Teukolsky|first2=Saul A.|last3=Vetterling|first3=William T.|last4=Flannery|first4=Brian P.|date=2007|title=Numerical recipes: the art of scientific computing|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=34|isbn=978-0-521-88068-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Floating point ==
{{Floating-point}}
In floating-point calculations, NaN is not the same as [[Extended real number line|infinity]], although both are typically handled as special cases in floating-point representations of real numbers as well as in floating-point operations.  An invalid operation is also not the same as an [[arithmetic overflow]] (which might return an infinity) or an [[arithmetic underflow]] (which would return the smallest [[normal number (computing)|normal number]], a [[denormal number]], or [[0 (number)|zero]]).

[[IEEE 754]] NaNs are represented with the exponent field filled with ones (like infinity values), and some non-zero number in the [[significand]] (to make them distinct from infinity values); this representation allows the definition of multiple distinct NaN values, depending on which bits are set in the significand, but also on the value of the leading sign bit (but applications are not required to provide distinct semantics for those distinct NaN values).

For example, a bit-wise [[IEEE floating-point]] standard single precision (32-bit) NaN would be: &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap;"&gt;s111 1111 1xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx&lt;/span&gt; where ''s'' is the sign (most often ignored in applications) and the ''x'' sequence represents a non-zero number (the value zero encodes infinities). The first bit from ''x'' is used to determine the type of NaN: "quiet NaN" or "signaling NaN". The remaining bits encode a ''payload'' (most often ignored in applications).

Floating-point operations other than ordered comparisons normally propagate a quiet NaN (''qNaN''). Most floating-point operations on a signaling NaN (''sNaN'') signal the invalid operation exception, the default exception action is then the same as for qNaN operands and they produce a qNaN if producing a floating-point result.

The propagation of quiet NaNs through arithmetic operations allows errors to be detected at the end of a sequence of operations without extensive testing during intermediate stages. However, note that depending on the language and the function, NaNs can silently be removed in expressions that would give a constant result for all other floating-point values e.g. NaN^0, which may be defined as 1, so in general a later test for a set ''invalid'' flag is needed to detect all cases where NaNs are introduced &lt;ref name=LectureNotes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ieee754status/IEEE754.PDF|title=Lecture Notes on the Status of IEEE Standard 754 for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic| author=William Kahan |date=1 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[#Function definition|Function definition]] below for further details).

In section 6.2 of the current [[IEEE 754-2008 revision|IEEE 754-2008]] standard there are two anomalous functions (the ''maxnum'' and ''minnum'' functions that return the maximum of two operands that are expected to be numbers) that favor numbers&amp;nbsp;— if just one of the operands is a NaN then the value of the other operand is returned. For the next revision of the IEEE 754 standard, it is planned to replace these functions as they are not [[associative property|associative]] (when a signaling NaN appears in an operand).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://754r.ucbtest.org/minutes/2017-05-19-minutes.txt|title=754R Minutes|date=19 May 2017|accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison with NaN ===
A comparison with a NaN always returns an ''unordered result'' even when comparing with itself. The comparison predicates are either signaling or non-signaling on quiet NaN operands; the signaling versions signal the invalid operation exception for such comparisons. The equality and inequality predicates are non-signaling so ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x'' returning false can be used to test if ''x'' is a quiet NaN. The other standard comparison predicates are all signaling if they receive a NaN operand, the standard also provides non-signaling versions of these other predicates. The predicate ''isNaN(x)'' determines if a value is a NaN and never signals an exception, even if ''x'' is a signaling NaN.

=== Operations generating NaN ===

There are three kinds of operations that can return NaN:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.39.2736|author=David Goldberg|title= What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Most operations with a NaN as at least one operand.
* [[Indeterminate forms]]:
** The divisions {{math|(±0) / (±0)}} and {{math|(±∞) / (±∞)}}.
** The multiplications {{math|(±0) × (±∞)}} and {{math|(±∞) × (±0)}}.
** Remainder {{math|''x'' % ''y''}} when {{math|''x''}} is an infinity or {{math|''y''}} is zero.
** The additions {{math|(+∞) + (&amp;minus;∞)}}, {{math|(&amp;minus;∞) + (+∞)}} and equivalent subtractions {{math|(+∞) &amp;minus; (+∞)}} and {{math|(&amp;minus;∞) &amp;minus; (&amp;minus;∞)}}.
** The standard has alternative functions for powers:
*** The standard &lt;tt&gt;pow&lt;/tt&gt; function and the integer exponent &lt;tt&gt;pown&lt;/tt&gt; function define [[zero to the power of zero|{{math|0⁰}}]], {{math|1&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and {{math|∞⁰}} as {{math|1}}.
*** The &lt;tt&gt;powr&lt;/tt&gt; function defines all three indeterminate forms as invalid operations and so returns NaN.
* Real operations with [[complex number|complex]] results, for example:
** The square root of a negative number.
** The logarithm of a negative number.
** The inverse sine or cosine of a number that is less than −1 or greater than 1.

NaNs may also be explicitly assigned to variables, typically as a representation for missing values. Prior to the IEEE standard, programmers often used a special value (such as −99999999) to represent undefined or missing values, but there was no guarantee that they would be handled consistently or correctly.&lt;ref name=idl/&gt;

NaNs are not necessarily generated in all the above cases. If an operation can produce an exception condition and traps are not masked then the operation will cause a trap instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.intel.com/products/processor/manuals/index.htm
|title=Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual Volume 1: Basic Architecture
|date=April 2008
|pages=118–125, 266–267, 334–335
}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an operand is a quiet NaN, and there isn't also a signaling NaN operand, then there is no exception condition and the result is a quiet NaN. Explicit assignments will not cause an exception even for signaling NaNs.

=== Quiet NaN ===
Quiet NaNs, or qNaNs, do not raise any additional exceptions as they propagate through most operations. The exceptions are where the NaN cannot simply be passed through unchanged to the output, such as in format conversions or certain comparison operations (which do not "expect" a NaN input).

=== Signaling NaN ===
Signaling NaNs, or sNaNs, are special forms of a NaN that when consumed by most operations should raise the invalid operation exception and then, if appropriate, be "quieted" into a qNaN that may then propagate. They were introduced in [[IEEE 754]]. There have been several ideas for how these might be used:

* Filling uninitialized memory with signaling NaNs would produce the invalid operation exception if the data is used before it is initialized
* Using an sNaN as a placeholder for a more complicated [[object (computer science)|object]], such as:
** A representation of a number that has [[arithmetic underflow|underflowed]]
** A representation of a number that has [[arithmetic overflow|overflowed]]
** Number in a higher precision format
** A [[complex number]]
When encountered, a trap handler could decode the sNaN and return an index to the computed result. In practice, this approach is faced with many complications. The treatment of the [[sign bit]] of NaNs for some simple operations (such as [[absolute value]]) is different from that for arithmetic operations. Traps are not required by the standard. There are other approaches to this sort of problem that would be more portable.

== Function definition ==

There are differences of opinion about the proper definition for the result of a numeric [[subroutine|function]] that receives a quiet NaN as input. One view is that the NaN should propagate to the output of the function in all cases to propagate the indication of an error. Another view, and the one taken by the [[C99|ISO C99]] and [[IEEE 754-2008 revision|IEEE 754-2008]] standards in general, is that if the function has multiple arguments and the output is uniquely determined by all the non-NaN inputs (including infinity), then that value should be the result. Thus for example the value returned by hypot(±∞,qNaN) and hypot(qNaN,±∞) is +∞.

The problem is particularly acute for the [[exponentiation]] function pow(x,y) = x&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;. The expressions 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, ∞&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and 1&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; are considered [[indeterminate form]]s when they occur as limits (just like ∞&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;0), and the question of whether [[Zero to the power of zero|zero to the zero power]] should be defined as 1 has divided opinion.

If the output is considered as undefined when a parameter is undefined, then pow(1,qNaN) should produce a qNaN. However, [[Math.h|math libraries]] have typically returned 1 for pow(1,y) for any [[real number]] y, and even when y is an [[Extended real number line|infinity]]. Similarly, they produce 1 for pow(x,0) even when x is 0 or an infinity. The rationale for returning the value 1 for the indeterminate forms was that the value of functions at singular points can be taken as a particular value if that value is in the limit the value{{Clarify|date=October 2011}} for all but a vanishingly small part of a ball around the limit value of the parameters.  The 2008 version of the [[IEEE 754]] standard says that pow(1,qNaN) and pow(qNaN,0) should both return 1 since they return 1 whatever else is used instead of quiet NaN. Moreover, ISO C99, and later IEEE 754-2008, chose to specify pow(−1,±∞) = 1 instead of qNaN; the reason of this choice is given in the C rationale:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/C99RationaleV5.10.pdf |title=Rationale for International Standard—Programming Languages—C, Revision 5.10 |date=April 2003 |page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Generally, C99 eschews a NaN result where a numerical value is useful. [...] The result of pow(−2,∞) is +∞, because all large positive floating-point values are even integers."

To satisfy those wishing a more strict interpretation of how the power function should act, the 2008 standard defines two additional power functions: pown(x,n), where the exponent must be an integer, and powr(x,y), which returns a NaN whenever a parameter is a NaN or the exponentiation would give an [[indeterminate form]].

== Integer NaN ==
Most fixed-size [[integer]] formats do not have any way of explicitly indicating invalid data. Converting NaN to an integer type, or performing an integer operation whose floating-point equivalent would produce NaN, usually throws an [[exception handling|exception]]. In [[Java programming language|Java]], such operations throw instances of &lt;code&gt;java.lang.ArithmeticException&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/ArithmeticException.html|title=ArithmeticException (Java Platform SE 8 )|author=|date=|website=docs.oracle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[C programming language|C]], they lead to [[undefined behavior]].

[[Perl]]'s {{mono|Math::BigInt}} package uses "NaN" for the result of strings that don't represent valid integers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Math::BigInt|url=http://perldoc.perl.org/Math/BigInt.html#Input|website=perldoc.perl.org|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since, in practice, encoded NaNs have a sign, a quiet/signaling bit and optional 'diagnostic information' (sometimes called a ''payload''), these will often be found in string representations of NaNs, too, for example:

  -NaN
   NaN12345
  -sNaN12300
  -NaN(s1234)

(other variants exist).

== Encoding ==
In [[IEEE 754]] standard-conforming floating-point storage formats, NaNs are identified by specific, pre-defined bit patterns unique to NaNs. The sign bit does not matter. Binary format NaNs are represented with the exponential field filled with ones (like infinity values), and some non-zero number in the significand field (to make them distinct from infinity values). The original IEEE 754 standard from 1985 ([[IEEE 754|IEEE 754-1985]]) only described binary floating-point formats, and did not specify how the signaling/quiet state was to be tagged. In practice, the most significant bit of the significand field determined whether a NaN is signaling or quiet. Two different implementations, with reversed meanings, resulted:
* most processors (including those of the [[Intel]] and [[AMD]]'s [[x86]] family, the [[Motorola 68000 family]], the [[AIM alliance|AIM]] [[PowerPC]] family, the [[ARM architecture|ARM]] family, the [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[SPARC]] family, and optionally new [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] processors) set the signaling/quiet bit to non-zero if the NaN is quiet, and to zero if the NaN is signaling. Thus, on these processors, the bit represents an 'is_quiet' flag;
* in NaNs generated by the [[PA-RISC]] and old MIPS processors, the signaling/quiet bit is zero if the NaN is quiet, and non-zero if the NaN is signaling. Thus, on these processors, the bit represents an 'is_signaling' flag.
The former choice has been preferred as it allows the implementation to quiet a signaling NaN by just setting the signaling/quiet bit to 1. The reverse is not possible with the latter choice because setting the signaling/quiet bit to 0 could yield an infinity.

The 2008 revision of the IEEE 754 standard ([[IEEE 754-2008 revision|IEEE 754-2008]]) makes formal recommendations for the encoding of the signaling/quiet state.
* For binary formats, the most significant bit of the significand field should be an 'is_quiet' flag. I.e. this bit is non-zero if the NaN is quiet, and zero if the NaN is signaling.
* For decimal formats, whether binary or decimal encoded, a NaN is identified by having the top five bits of the combination field after the sign bit set to ones. The sixth bit of the field is the 'is_quiet' flag. The standard follows the interpretation as an 'is_signaling' flag. I.e. the signaling/quiet bit is zero if the NaN is quiet, and non-zero if the NaN is signaling. A signaling NaN is quieted by clearing this sixth bit.

For IEEE 754-2008 conformance, the meaning of the signaling/quiet bit in recent MIPS processors is now configurable via the NAN2008 field of the FCSR register. This support is optional in MIPS Release&amp;nbsp;3 and required in Release&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdn2.imgtec.com/documentation/MD00083-2B-MIPS64INT-AFP-05.04.pdf|title=MIPS® Architecture For Programmers – Volume I-A: Introduction to the MIPS64® Architecture|date=20 November 2013|publisher=MIPS Technologies, Inc.|page=79|format=PDF|access-date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state/value of the remaining bits of the significand field are not defined by the standard. This value is called the 'payload' of the NaN. If an operation has a single NaN input and propagates it to the output, the result NaN's payload should be that of the input NaN (this is not always possible for binary formats when the signaling/quiet state is encoded by an 'is_signaling' flag, as explained above). If there are multiple NaN inputs, the result NaN's payload should be from one of the input NaNs; the standard does not specify which.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12319">An '''object of the mind''' is an [[object (philosophy)|object]] that [[Existence|exists]] in the imagination, but which, in the real world, can only be represented or modeled. Some such objects are [[abstraction]]s, [[literary]] [[concept]]s, or [[fictional]] [[scenario]]s.

Closely related are '''intentional objects''', which are what thoughts and feelings are [[intentionality|about]], even if they are not about anything real (such as thoughts 
about [[unicorn]]s, or feelings of apprehension about a dental appointment which is subsequently cancelled).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mac.com/cranetim/iWeb/Tim's%20website/Online%20papers_files/Intentional%20objects-1.pdf Tim Crane - ''Intentional Objects'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, intentional objects may coincide with real objects (as in thoughts about horses, or a feeling of regret about a missed appointment).

==Mathematical objects==
Mathematics and geometry describe [[abstract object]]s that sometimes correspond to familiar shapes, and sometimes do not. Circles, triangles, rectangles, and so forth describe two-dimensional shapes that are often found in the real world. However, mathematical formulas do not describe individual physical circles, triangles, or rectangles. They describe ideal shapes that are [[object (philosophy)|object]]s of the [[mind]]. The incredible precision of mathematical expression permits a vast applicability of mental abstractions to real life situations.

Many more mathematical formulas describe shapes that are unfamiliar, or do not necessarily correspond to objects in the real world. For example, the [[Klein bottle]]&lt;ref&gt;The Teaching Company, Course No. 1423. "Joy of Thinking: The Beauty and Power of Classical Mathematical Ideas." Lecture 14 - "A One-Sided, Sealed Surface - the Klein Bottle." Professors Edward B. Burger, Michael Starbird.&lt;/ref&gt; is a one-sided, sealed surface with no inside or outside (in other words, it is the three-dimensional equivalent of the [[Möbius strip]]). Such objects can be represented by twisting and cutting or taping pieces of paper together, as well as by computer simulations. To hold them in the imagination, abstractions such as extra or fewer dimensions are necessary.

==Logical sequences==
If-then arguments posit [[logical]] [[sequences]] that sometimes include objects of the mind. For example, a [[counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] argument proposes a [[hypothetical]] or [[subjunctive]] [[Subjunctive possibility|possibility]] which ''could'' or ''would'' be true, but ''might not'' be false. [[Conditional probability|Conditional]] sequences involving subjunctives use [[intensional logic|intensional]] language, which is studied by [[modal logic]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://eom.springer.de/M/m064320.htm ''Modal Logic''. Springer Online Reference Works.]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[classical logic]] studies the [[extensional]] language of [[logical possibility|necessary]] and [[sufficient]] conditions.

In general, a logical [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] is a sufficient condition, and a logical [[consequent]] is a necessary condition(or the [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]) in a [[logical conditional]]. But logical conditionals accounting only for necessity and sufficiency do not always reflect every day if-then reasoning, and for this reason they are sometimes known as [[material conditional]]s. In contrast, [[indicative conditional]]s, sometimes known as non-material conditionals,&lt;ref&gt;[http://facweb.bcc.ctc.edu/wpayne/non-material%20conditional.htm Payne, W. Russ ''The non-material conditional'']&lt;/ref&gt; attempt to describe if-then reasoning involving hypotheticals, fictions, or counterfactuals.

[[Truth tables]] for if-then statements identify four unique combinations of premises and conclusions: true premises and true conclusions; false premises and true conclusions; true premises and false conclusions; false premises and false conclusions. [[Strict conditional]]s assign a positive [[truth-value]] to every case except the case of a true premise and a false conclusion. This is sometimes regarded as counterintuitive, but makes more sense when false conditions are understood as objects of the mind.

===False antecedent===
A false antecedent is a premise known to be false, fictional, imaginary, or unnecessary. In a conditional sequence, a false antecedent may be the basis for any consequence, true or false.

The subjects of [[literature]] are sometimes false antecedents. For example, the contents of [[false documents]], the origins of [[wikt:stand-alone|stand-alone]] phenomena, or the implications of [[loaded words]]. Also, artificial sources, personalities, events, and histories. False antecedents are sometimes referred to as "[[nothing]]", or "[[nonexistent]]", whereas nonexistent referents are not referred to.

[[Art]] and [[acting]] often portray scenarios without any antecedent except an artist's imagination. For example, mythical heroes, legendary creatures, gods, and goddesses.

===False consequent===
A false consequent, in contrast, is a conclusion known to be false, fictional, imaginary, or insufficient. In a conditional statement, a fictional conclusion is known as a [[non sequitur (logic)|non sequitur]], which literally means ''out of sequence''. A conclusion that is out of sequence is not contingent on any premises that precede it, and it does not follow from them, so such a sequence is not conditional. A conditional sequence is a connected series of statements. A false consequent cannot follow from true premises in a connected sequence. But, on the other hand, a false consequent can follow from a false antecedent.

As an example, the name of a [[team]], a [[genre]], or a [[nation]] is a collective term applied [[ex post facto]] to a group of distinct individuals. None of the individuals on a sports team is the team itself, nor is any musical chord a genre, nor any person America. The name is an identity for a collection that is connected by [[consensus]] or [[reference]], but not by sequence. A different name could equally follow, but it would have different [[social]] or [[political]] [[meaning (semiotics)|significance]].

==Philosophy of mind==

{{main|Mind-body dualism}}

In philosophy, [[mind-body dualism]] is the doctrine that mental activities exist apart from the physical body, notably posited by [[René Descartes]] in ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''.

==Invented sources==
{{main|False document}}
Many objects in fiction follow the example of false antecedents or false consequents. For example, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] is based on an imaginary book. In the ''Appendices'' to ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien's characters name the ''[[Red Book of Westmarch]]'' as the source material for ''The Lord of the Rings'', which they describe as a translation. But the ''Red Book of Westmarch'' is a fictional document that chronicles events in an [[imaginary world]]. One might imagine a different [[translation]], by another author.

==Convenient fictions==
{{see|Fictionalism}}
[[Social reality]] is composed of many standards and [[inventions]] that facilitate [[communication]], but which are ultimately objects of the mind. For example, [[money]] is an object of the mind which [[currency]] represents. Similarly, [[language]]s signify [[idea]]s and [[thoughts]].

Objects of the mind are frequently involved in the roles that people play. For example, [[acting]] is a profession which predicates real jobs on fictional premises. [[Charades]] is a game people play by guessing imaginary objects from short play-acts.

Imaginary [[personalities]] and histories are sometimes invented to enhance the [[verisimilitude]] of [[fictional universes]], and/or the [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]] of [[role-playing games]]. In the sense that they exist independently of extant personalities and histories, they are believed to be fictional characters and fictional time frames.

[[Science fiction]] is abundant with future times, alternate times, and past times that are objects of the mind. For example, in the novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]], the number 1984 represented a year that had not yet passed.

[[Calendar date]]s also represent objects of the mind, specifically, past and future times. In ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'', which was released in 1986, the narration opens with the statement, "It is the year 2005." In 1986, that statement was futuristic. During the year 2005, that reference to the year 2005 was factual. Now, ''The Transformers: The Movie'' is [[retro-futuristic]]. The number 2005 did not change, but the object of the mind that it represents did change.

Deliberate [[invention]] also may reference an object of the mind. The intentional invention of fiction for the purpose of [[deception]] is usually referred to as [[lie|lying]], in contrast to invention for [[entertainment]] or [[art]]. Invention is also often applied to [[problem solving]]. In this sense the physical invention of materials is associated with the [[mind|mental]] invention of fictions.

Convenient fictions also occur in science.

==Science==
The theoretical posits of one era's scientific theories may be demoted to mere '''objects of the mind''' by subsequent discoveries: some standard examples include [[phlogiston]] and [[ptolemaic epicycle]]s.

This raises questions, in the debate between [[scientific realism]] and [[instrumentalism]] about the status of current posits, such as [[black hole]]s and [[quark]]s. Are they still merely intentional, even if the theory is correct?

The situation is further complicated by the existence in scientific practice of entities which are explicitly held not to be real, but which nonetheless serve a purpose—convenient fictions. Examples include [[field line|field lines]], [[centers of gravity]], and [[electron hole]]s in semiconductor theory.

==Self-reference==
{{Original research|section|date=September 2007}}
A [[reference]] that names an imaginary [[source text|source]] is in some sense also a [[self-reference]]. A self-reference automatically makes a comment about itself. Premises that name themselves as premises are premises by self-reference; conclusions that name themselves as conclusions are conclusions by self-reference.

In their respective [[imaginary world]]s the ''Necronomicon'', ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', and the ''Red Book of Westmarch'' are realities, but only because they are referred to as real. Authors use this technique to invite readers to [[roleplaying|pretend]] or to make-believe that their imaginary world is real. In the sense that the stories that quote these books are true, the quoted books exist; in the sense that the stories are fiction, the quoted books do not exist.

==Nonexistent objects==
Austrian philosopher [[Alexius Meinong]] (1853–1920) advanced nonexistent objects in the 19th and 20th century within a “theory of objects”. He was interested in intentional states which are directed at nonexistent objects.  Starting with the “principle of intentionality”,  mental phenomena are intentionally directed towards an object.  People may imagine, desire or fear something that does not exist.  Other philosophers concluded that intentionality is not a real relation and therefore does not require the existence of an object, while Meinong concluded there is an object for every mental state whatsoever—if not an existent then at least a nonexistent one.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Nonexistent Objects, First published Tue Aug 22, 2006; substantive revision Thu Sep 7, 2006, Accessed May 18, 2010 [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonexistent-objects/#HisRooAleMeiProInt]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4411">In [[psychometrics]], '''predictive validity''' is the extent to which a [[test score|score]] on a [[scale (social sciences)|scale]] or [[test (student assessment)|test]] predicts scores on some criterion measure.&lt;ref&gt;Cronbach, L.J., &amp; Meehl, P.E. (1955). Construct validity for psychological tests.'' Psychological Bulletin'', ''52'', 281-302.[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Cronbach/construct.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board]] (MASB) endorses this definition as part of its ongoing [http://www.commonlanguage.wikispaces.net/ Common Language in Marketing Project].&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] of a cognitive test for job performance is the correlation between test scores and, for example, supervisor performance ratings.  Such a cognitive test would have ''predictive validity'' if the observed correlation were statistically significant. 

Predictive validity shares similarities with [[concurrent validity]] in that both are generally measured as correlations between a test and some criterion measure. In a study of concurrent validity the test is administered at the same time as the criterion is collected. This is a common method of developing validity evidence for employment tests: A test is administered to incumbent employees, then a rating of those employees' [[job performance]] is, or has already been, obtained independently of the test (often, as noted above, in the form of a supervisor rating). Note the possibility for restriction of range both in test scores and performance scores: The incumbent employees are likely to be a more homogeneous and higher performing group than the applicant pool at large.

In a strict study of predictive validity, the test scores are collected first; then at some later time the criterion measure is collected. For predictive validity, the example is slightly different: Tests are administered, perhaps to job applicants, and then after those individuals work in the job for a year, their test scores are correlated with their first year job performance scores. Another relevant example is [[SAT]] scores: These are validated by collecting the scores during the examinee's senior year and high school and then waiting a year (or more) to correlate the scores with their first year college [[grade point average]]. Thus predictive validity provides somewhat more useful data about test validity because it has greater fidelity to the real situation in which the test will be used. After all, most tests are administered to find out something about future behavior.

As with many aspects of social science, the magnitude of the [[correlation]]s obtained from predictive validity studies is usually not high. A typical predictive validity for an employment test might obtain a correlation in the neighborhood of ''r''=.35. Higher values are occasionally seen and lower values are very common. Nonetheless the [[utility]] (that is the benefit obtained by making decisions using the test) provided by a test with a correlation of .35 can be quite substantial. More information, and an explanation of the relationship between variance and predictive validity, can be found here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do Psychometric Tests Work?|url= https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-psychometric-tests-work-dr-mark-parkinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predictive validity in modern validity theory==

The latest ''Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing''&lt;ref name="1999standards"&gt;American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, &amp; National Council on Measurement in Education. (1999). ''Standards for educational and psychological testing''. Washington, DC: American Educational Research Association.&lt;/ref&gt; reflect Samuel Messick's model of validity&lt;ref name="messick1995"&gt;Messick, S. (1995). Validity of psychological assessment: Validation of inferences from persons’ responses and performances as scientific inquiry into score meaning. ''American Psychologist, 50'', 741-749.&lt;/ref&gt; and do not use the term "predictive validity." Rather, the ''Standards'' describe validity-supporting "Evidence Based on Relationships [between the test scores and] Other Variables."

Predictive validity involves testing a group of subjects for a certain construct, and then comparing them with results obtained at some point in the future.

When number (generally large number) is represented in a finite alphabet set, and it cannot be represented by just one member of the set, '''Recursive indexing''' is used.

Recursive indexing itself is a method to write the successive differences of the number after extracting the maximum value of the alphabet set from the number, and continuing recursively till the difference falls in the range of the set.

Recursive indexing with a 2-letter alphabet is called [[unary code]].

==Encoding==
To encode a number ''N'', keep reducing the maximum element of this set (''S''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) from ''N'' and output ''S''max for each such difference, stopping when the number lies in the half closed half open
range [0&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Example===
Let ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[0 1 2 3 4 … 10], be an 11-element set, and we have to recursively index the value N=49.

According to this method, we need to keep removing 10 from 49, and keep proceeding till we reach a number in the 0–10 range.

So the values are 10 (''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;49&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;10 =&amp;nbsp;39), 10 (''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;39&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;29), 10 (''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;29&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;19), 10 (''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;19&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9), 9.
Hence the recursively indexed sequence for ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;49 with set ''S'', is&amp;nbsp;10,&amp;nbsp;10,&amp;nbsp;10,&amp;nbsp;10,&amp;nbsp;9.

==Decoding==
Keep adding all the elements of the index, stopping when the index value is between (inclusive of ends) the least and penultimate elements of the set ''S''.

===Example===
Continuing from above example we have&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;9&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;49.

==Uses==
This technique is most commonly used in [[run-length encoding]] systems to encode longer runs than the alphabet sizes permit.

'''''Regular Polytopes''''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[geometry]] book written by [[Canada|Canadian]] [[mathematician]] [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter]]. Originally published in 1947, the book was updated and republished in 1963 and 1973.

The book is a comprehensive survey of the geometry of [[regular polytope]]s, the generalisation of regular [[polygon]]s and regular [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] to [[higher dimensions]]. Originating with an essay entitled ''Dimensional Analogy'' written in 1923, the first edition of the book took Coxeter twenty-four years to complete.

==Overview==
[[File:Schlegel wireframe 120-cell.png|left|150px|thumb|[[Schlegel diagram]] of the [[120-cell]], a 4-dimensional regular polytope.]]
''Regular Polytopes'' is a standard reference work on regular polygons, polyhedra and their higher dimensional analogues. It is unusual in the breadth of its coverage; its combination of mathematical rigour with geometric insight; and the clarity of its diagrams and illustrations.

Coxeter starts by introducing two-dimensional polygons and three-dimensional polyhedra. He then gives a rigorous combinatorial definition of "regularity" and uses it to show that there are no other [[Convex polyhedron|convex]] regular polyhedra apart from the five [[Platonic solid]]s. The concept of "regularity" is extended to non-convex shapes such as [[star polygon]]s and [[star polyhedron|star polyhedra]]; to [[tessellation]]s and [[honeycomb]]s and to polytopes in higher dimensions. Coxeter introduces and uses the [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] generated by reflections that became known as [[Coxeter group]]s.

The book combines algebraic rigour with clear explanations, many of which are illustrated with diagrams, and with a diagramatic notation for [[Wythoff construction]]s. The black and white plates in the book show solid models of three-dimensional polyhedra, and wire-frame models of projections of some higher-dimensional polytopes. At the end of each chapter Coxeter includes an "Historical remarks" section which provides an historical perspective of the development of the subject.

The challenge of comprehending higher dimensions was addressed by Coxeter on page 118: "There are three ways of approaching the Euclidean geometry of four or more dimensions: the axiomatic, the algebraic (or analytical) and the intuitive. The first two have been admirably expounded by [[Duncan Sommerville|Sommerville]] and [[Eric Harold Neville|Neville]], and we shall presuppose some familiarity with such treatises."&lt;ref&gt;[[Duncan Sommerville]] (1929) ''Introduction to the Geometry of N Dimensions''; and [[Eric Harold Neville]] (1921) [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/u/umhistmath/ABR2619.0001.001?rgn=works;view=toc;rgn1=author;q1=Neville The Fourth Dimension] from [[University of Michigan]] Historical Math Collection&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the third, [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] wrote: "A man who really pursues it, will end up holding on to the fourth dimension".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3512">In mathematical [[group theory]], the '''root datum''' of a connected split [[reductive group|reductive]] [[algebraic group]] over a field is a generalization of a [[root system]] that determines the group up to isomorphism. They were introduced by [[Michel Demazure]] in [[Grothendieck's Séminaire de géométrie algébrique|SGA III]], published in 1970.

==Definition==
A '''root datum''' consists of a quadruple
:&lt;math&gt;(X^\ast, \Phi, X_\ast, \Phi^\vee)&lt;/math&gt;,
where 
* &lt;math&gt;X^\ast&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_\ast&lt;/math&gt; are free abelian groups of finite [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] together with a [[perfect pairing]] between them with values in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; which we denote by ( , ) (in other words, each is identified with the dual of the other).
* &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is a finite subset of &lt;math&gt;X^\ast&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Phi^\vee&lt;/math&gt; is a finite subset of &lt;math&gt;X_\ast&lt;/math&gt; and there is a bijection from &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;\Phi^\vee&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\alpha\mapsto\alpha^\vee&lt;/math&gt;.
* For each &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(\alpha, \alpha^\vee)=2&lt;/math&gt;.
* For each &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the map &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto x-(x,\alpha^\vee)\alpha&lt;/math&gt; induces an automorphism of the root datum (in other words it maps &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; and the induced action on &lt;math&gt;X_\ast&lt;/math&gt; maps &lt;math&gt;\Phi^\vee&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\Phi^\vee&lt;/math&gt;)

The elements of &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; are called the '''roots''' of the root datum, and the elements of &lt;math&gt;\Phi^\vee&lt;/math&gt; are called the '''coroots'''.

If &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; does not contain &lt;math&gt;2\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in\Phi&lt;/math&gt;, then the root datum is called '''reduced'''.

==The root datum of an algebraic group==
If ''G'' is  a reductive algebraic group over an [[algebraically closed field]] ''K'' with a split maximal torus ''T''  then its '''root datum''' is a quadruple 
:(''X''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;Phi;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;Phi;&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;), 
where 
*''X''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is the lattice of characters of the  maximal torus, 
*''X''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; is the dual lattice (given by the 1-parameter subgroups), 
*&amp;Phi; is a set of  roots, 
*&amp;Phi;&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt; is the corresponding set of coroots.

A connected split reductive algebraic group over ''K''  is uniquely determined (up to isomorphism) by its root datum, which is always reduced. Conversely for any root datum there is a reductive algebraic group. A root datum contains slightly more information than the [[Dynkin diagram]], because it also determines the center of the group.

For any root datum (''X''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;Phi;,''X''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;Phi;&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;), we can define a '''dual root datum''' (''X''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;Phi;&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;,''X''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;Phi;) by switching the characters with the 1-parameter subgroups, and switching the roots with the coroots.

If ''G'' is a connected reductive algebraic group over the algebraically closed field ''K'', then its [[Langlands dual group]] &lt;sup&gt;''L''&lt;/sup&gt;''G'' is the complex connected reductive group whose root datum is dual to that of ''G''.

==Definitions and statement==
If &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \mathcal{F}=\{S_1,S_2,\dots\}&lt;/math&gt; is a family of sets, and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is another set, then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is said to be [[Shattered set|shattered]] by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; if every subset of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; (including the [[empty set]] and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; itself) can be obtained as an intersection &lt;math&gt;T\cap S_i&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and a set in the family. The VC dimension of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the largest [[cardinality]] of a set shattered by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;.

In terms of these definitions, the Sauer–Shelah lemma states that if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a family of sets with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; distinct elements such that
&lt;math&gt; \textstyle |\mathcal{F}| &gt; \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} {\binom{n}{i}}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; shatters a set of size &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Equivalently, if the VC dimension of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;k,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; can consist of at most &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{i=0}^{k} {\binom{n}{i}} =O(n^k)&lt;/math&gt; sets.

The bound of the lemma is tight: Let the family &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; be composed of all subsets of &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,\dots n\}&lt;/math&gt; with size less than &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Then the size of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is exactly &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} {\binom{n}{i}}&lt;/math&gt; but it does not shatter any set of size &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="gowers"&gt;{{citation|title=Dimension arguments in combinatorics|at=Example 3|first=Timothy|last=Gowers|authorlink=Timothy Gowers|work=Gowers's Weblog: Mathematics related discussions|url=http://gowers.wordpress.com/2008/07/31/dimension-arguments-in-combinatorics/|date=July 31, 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The number of shattered sets==
A strengthening of the Sauer–Shelah lemma, due to {{harvtxt|Pajor|1985}}, states that every finite set family &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;shatters at least &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal{F}|&lt;/math&gt; sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | volume = 16
 | year = 1985}}. As cited by {{harvtxt|Anstee|Rónyai|Sali|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This immediately implies the Sauer–Shelah lemma, because only  &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} {\tbinom{n}{i}} &lt;/math&gt; of the subsets of an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-item universe have cardinality less than &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, when &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal{F}|&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} {\tbinom{n}{i}}&lt;/math&gt;, there are not enough small sets to be shattered, so one of the shattered sets must have cardinality at least &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

For a restricted type of shattered set, called an order-shattered set, the number of shattered sets always equals the cardinality of the set family.&lt;ref name="ars02"/&gt;

==Proof==
Pajor's variant of the Sauer–Shelah lemma may be proved by [[mathematical induction]]; the proof has variously been credited to [[Noga Alon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/09/28/extremal-combinatorics-iii-some-basic-theorems/|first=Gil|last=Kalai|authorlink=Gil Kalai|title=Extremal Combinatorics III: Some Basic Theorems|work=Combinatorics and More|date=September 28, 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or to [[Ron Aharoni]] and Ron Holzman.&lt;ref name="ars02"&gt;{{citation

'''Base:''' every family of only one set shatters the empty set. 

'''Step:''' Assume the lemma is true for all families of size less than &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal{F}|&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; be a family of two or more sets. Let &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; be an element that belongs to some but not all of the sets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. Split &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; into two subfamilies, of the sets that contain &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and the sets that do not contain &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. 

By the induction assumption, these two subfamilies shatter two collections of sets whose sizes add to at least &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal{F}|&lt;/math&gt;. 

None of these shattered sets contain &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, since a set that contains &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; cannot be shattered by a family in which all sets contain &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or all sets do not contain &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

Some of the shattered sets may be shattered by both subfamilies. When a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is shattered by only one of the two subfamilies, it contributes one unit both to the number of shattered sets of the subfamily and to the number of shattered sets of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. When a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is shattered by both subfamilies, both &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S\cup\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; are shattered by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; contributes two units to the number of shattered sets of the subfamilies and of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the number of shattered sets of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is at least equal to the number shattered by the two subfamilies of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, which is at least &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal{F}|&lt;/math&gt;.

A different proof of the Sauer–Shelah lemma in its original form, by [[Péter Frankl]] and [[János Pach]], is based on [[linear algebra]] and the [[inclusion–exclusion principle]].&lt;ref name="pa95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gowers"/&gt;

==Applications==
The original application of the lemma, by Vapnik and Chervonenkis, was in showing that every probability distribution can be approximated (with respect to a family of events of a given VC dimension) by a finite set of sample points whose [[cardinality]] depends only on the VC dimension of the family of events. In this context, there are two important notions of approximation, both parameterized by a number &amp;epsilon;: a set ''S'' of samples, and a probability distribution on ''S'', is said to be an &amp;epsilon;-approximation of the original distribution if the probability of each event with respect to ''S'' differs from its original probability by at most &amp;epsilon;. A set ''S'' of (unweighted) samples is said to be an [[ε-net (computational geometry)|&amp;epsilon;-net]] if every event with probability at least &amp;epsilon; includes at least one point of ''S''. An &amp;epsilon;-approximation must also be an &amp;epsilon;-net but not necessarily vice versa.

Vapnik and Chervonenkis used the lemma to show that set systems of VC dimension ''d'' always have &amp;epsilon;-approximations of cardinality &lt;math&gt;O(\tfrac{d}{\epsilon^2}\log\tfrac{d}{\epsilon})&lt;/math&gt;.

For any particular ''E'', the probability that ''x'' is missed while ''y'' is larger than its median is very small,
and the Sauer–Shelah lemma (applied to &lt;math&gt;x\cup y&lt;/math&gt;) shows that only a small number of distinct events ''E'' need to be considered, so by the [[Boole's inequality|union bound]], with nonzero probability, ''x'' is an ε-net.&lt;ref name="pa95"/&gt;

In turn, ε-nets and ε-approximations, and the likelihood that a random sample of large enough cardinality has these properties, have important applications in [[machine learning]], in the area of [[probably approximately correct learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In [[topology]] and related fields of [[mathematics]], there are several restrictions that one often makes on the kinds of [[topological space]]s that one wishes to consider. Some of these restrictions are given by the '''separation axioms'''. These are sometimes called ''Tychonoff separation axioms'', after [[Andrey Tychonoff]].

The separation axioms are [[axiom]]s only in the sense that, when defining the notion of [[topological space]], one could add these conditions as extra axioms to get a more restricted notion of what a topological space is. The modern approach is to fix once and for all the [[axiomatization]] of topological space and then speak of ''kinds'' of topological spaces.
However, the term "separation axiom" has stuck. The separation axioms are denoted with the letter "T" after the [[German language|German]] ''Trennungsaxiom'', which means "separation axiom."

The precise meanings of the terms associated with the separation axioms has varied over time, as explained in [[History of the separation axioms]]. It is important to understand the authors' definition of each condition mentioned to know exactly what they mean, especially when reading older literature.

==Preliminary definitions==
Before we define the separation axioms themselves, we give concrete meaning to the concept of separated sets (and points) in [[topological space]]s. (Separated sets are not the same as ''separated spaces'', defined in the next section.)

The separation axioms are about the use of topological means to distinguish [[disjoint set]]s and [[Distinct (mathematics)|distinct]] points. It's not enough for elements of a topological space to be distinct (that is, [[Equality (mathematics)|unequal]]); we may want them to be ''topologically distinguishable''. Similarly, it's not enough for [[subset]]s of a topological space to be disjoint; we may want them to be ''separated'' (in any of various ways). The separation axioms all say, in one way or another, that points or sets that are distinguishable or separated in some weak sense must also be distinguishable or separated in some stronger sense.

Let ''X'' be a topological space. Then two points ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X'' are '''topologically distinguishable''' if they do not have exactly the same [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]]s (or equivalently the same open neighbourhoods); that is, at least one of them has a neighbourhood that is not a neighbourhood of the other (or equivalently there is an [[open set]] that one point belongs to but the other point does not).

Two points ''x'' and ''y'' are '''separated''' if each of them has a neighbourhood that is not a neighbourhood of the other; that is, neither belongs to the other's [[Closure (topology)|closure]]. More generally, two subsets ''A'' and ''B'' of ''X'' are '''separated''' if each is disjoint from the other's closure. (The closures themselves do not have to be disjoint.) All of the remaining conditions for separation of sets may also be applied to points (or to a point and a set) by using singleton sets. Points ''x'' and ''y'' will be considered separated, by neighbourhoods, by closed neighbourhoods, by a continuous function, precisely by a function, if and only if their singleton sets {''x''} and {''y''} are separated according to the corresponding criterion.

Subsets ''A'' and ''B'' are '''separated by neighbourhoods''' if they have disjoint neighbourhoods. They are '''separated by closed neighbourhoods''' if they have disjoint closed neighbourhoods. They are '''separated by a continuous function''' if there exists a [[continuous function]] ''f'' from the space ''X'' to the [[real line]] '''R''' such that the [[image (function)|image]] ''f''(''A'') equals {0} and ''f''(''B'') equals {1}. Finally, they are '''precisely separated by a continuous function''' if there exists a continuous function ''f'' from ''X'' to '''R''' such that the [[preimage]] ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;({0}) equals ''A'' and ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;({1}) equals ''B''.

These conditions are given in order of increasing strength: Any two topologically distinguishable points must be distinct, and any two separated points must be topologically distinguishable. Any two separated sets must be disjoint, any two sets separated by neighbourhoods must be separated, and so on.

For more on these conditions (including their use outside the separation axioms), see the articles [[Separated sets]] and [[Topological distinguishability]].

== Main definitions ==

These definitions all use essentially the [[#Preliminary definitions|preliminary definitions]] above.

Many of these names have alternative meanings in some of mathematical literature, as explained on [[History of the separation axioms]]; for example, the meanings of "normal" and "T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;" are sometimes interchanged, similarly "regular" and "T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;", etc. Many of the concepts also have several names; however, the one listed first is always least likely to be ambiguous.

Most of these axioms have alternative definitions with the same meaning; the definitions given here fall into a consistent pattern that relates the various notions of separation defined in the previous section. Other possible definitions can be found in the individual articles.

In all of the following definitions, ''X'' is again a [[topological space]].

* ''X'' is '''[[T0 space|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]''', or ''Kolmogorov'', if any two distinct points in ''X'' are [[topological distinguishability|topologically distinguishable]]. (It will be a common theme among the separation axioms to have one version of an axiom that requires T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and one version that doesn't.)
* ''X'' is '''[[R0 space|R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]''', or ''symmetric'', if any two topologically distinguishable points in ''X'' are separated.
* ''X'' is '''[[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]]''', or ''accessible'' or ''Fréchet'' or ''Tikhonov'', if any two distinct points in ''X'' are separated. Thus, ''X'' is T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if it is both T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. (Although you may say such things as "T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space", "Fréchet topology", and "Suppose that the topological space ''X'' is Fréchet", avoid saying "Fréchet space" in this context, since there is another entirely different notion of [[Fréchet space]] in [[functional analysis]].)
* ''X'' is '''[[R1 space|R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]]''', or ''preregular'', if any two topologically distinguishable points in ''X'' are separated by neighbourhoods. Every R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space is also R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.
* ''X'' is '''[[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]''', or ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''separated'', if any two distinct points in ''X'' are separated by neighbourhoods. Thus, ''X'' is Hausdorff if and only if it is both T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Every Hausdorff space is also T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
* ''X'' is '''[[Urysohn space|T&lt;sub&gt;2½&lt;/sub&gt;]]''', or ''Urysohn'', if any two distinct points in ''X'' are separated by closed neighbourhoods. Every T&lt;sub&gt;2½&lt;/sub&gt; space is also Hausdorff.
* ''X'' is '''[[completely Hausdorff space|completely Hausdorff]]''', or ''completely T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', if any two distinct points in ''X'' are separated by a continuous function. Every completely Hausdorff space is also T&lt;sub&gt;2½&lt;/sub&gt;.
* ''X'' is '''[[regular space|regular]]''' if, given any point ''x'' and closed set ''F'' in ''X'' such that ''x'' does not belong to ''F'', they are separated by neighbourhoods. (In fact, in a regular space, any such ''x'' and ''F'' will also be separated by closed neighbourhoods.) Every regular space is also R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
* ''X'' is '''[[regular Hausdorff space|regular Hausdorff]]''', or ''T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'', if it is both T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and regular.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter, p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; Every regular Hausdorff space is also T&lt;sub&gt;2½&lt;/sub&gt;.
* ''X'' is '''[[completely regular space|completely regular]]''' if, given any point ''x'' and closed set ''F'' in ''X'' such that ''x'' does not belong to ''F'', they are separated by a continuous function. Every completely regular space is also regular.
* ''X'' is '''[[Tychonoff space|Tychonoff]]''', or ''T&lt;sub&gt;3½&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''completely T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'', or ''completely regular Hausdorff'', if it is both T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and completely regular.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; Every Tychonoff space is both regular Hausdorff and completely Hausdorff.
* ''X'' is '''[[normal space|normal]]''' if any two disjoint closed subsets of ''X'' are separated by neighbourhoods. (In fact, a space is normal if and only if any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by a continuous function; this is [[Urysohn's lemma]].)
* ''X'' is '''[[normal Hausdorff space|normal Hausdorff]]''', or ''T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'', if it is both T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and normal. Every normal Hausdorff space is both Tychonoff and normal regular.
* ''X'' is '''[[completely normal space|completely normal]]''' if any two separated sets are separated by neighbourhoods. Every completely normal space is also normal.
* ''X'' is '''[[completely normal Hausdorff space|completely normal Hausdorff]]''', or ''T&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''completely T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'', if it is both completely normal and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Every completely normal Hausdorff space is also normal Hausdorff.
* ''X'' is '''[[perfectly normal space|perfectly normal]]''' if any two disjoint closed sets are precisely separated by a continuous function. Every perfectly normal space is also completely normal.
* ''X'' is '''[[perfectly normal Hausdorff space|perfectly normal Hausdorff]]''', or ''T&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''perfectly T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'', if it is both perfectly normal and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Every perfectly normal Hausdorff space is also completely normal Hausdorff.

==Relationships between the axioms==
The T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; axiom is special in that it can be not only added to a property (so that completely regular plus T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is Tychonoff) but also subtracted from a property (so that Hausdorff minus T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), in a fairly precise sense; see [[Kolmogorov quotient]] for more information. When applied to the separation axioms, this leads to the relationships in the table to the left below. In this table, you go from the right side to the left side by adding the requirement of T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and you go from the left side to the right side by removing that requirement, using the Kolmogorov quotient operation. (The names in parentheses given on the left side of this table are generally ambiguous or at least less well known; but they are used in the diagram below.)

Other than the inclusion or exclusion of T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the relationships between the separation axioms are indicated in the diagram to the right. In this diagram, the non-T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; version of a condition is on the left side of the slash, and the T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; version is on the right side. Letters are used for [[abbreviation]] as follows:
"P" = "perfectly", "C" = "completely", "N" = "normal", and "R" (without a subscript) = "regular". A bullet indicates that there is no special name for a space at that spot. The dash at the bottom indicates no condition.

You can combine two properties using this diagram by following the diagram upwards until both branches meet. For example, if a space is both completely normal ("CN") and completely Hausdorff ("CT&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;"), then following both branches up, you find the spot "•/T&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;".
Since completely Hausdorff spaces are T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (even though completely normal spaces may not be), you take the T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; side of the slash, so a completely normal completely Hausdorff space is the same as a T&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; space (less ambiguously known as a completely normal Hausdorff space, as you can see in the table above).

As you can see from the diagram, normal and R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; together imply a host of other properties, since combining the two properties leads you to follow a path through the many nodes on the rightside branch. Since regularity is the most well known of these, spaces that are both normal and R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are typically called "normal regular spaces". In a somewhat similar fashion, spaces that are both normal and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are often called "normal Hausdorff spaces" by people that wish to avoid the ambiguous "T" notation. These conventions can be generalised to other regular spaces and Hausdorff spaces.

==Other separation axioms==
There are some other conditions on topological spaces that are sometimes classified with the separation axioms, but these don't fit in with the usual separation axioms as completely. Other than their definitions, they aren't discussed here; see their individual articles.

* ''X'' is '''[[sober space|sober]]''' if, for every closed set ''C'' that is not the (possibly nondisjoint) union of two smaller closed sets, there is a unique point ''p'' such that the closure of {''p''} equals ''C''. More briefly, every irreducible closed set has a unique generic point. Any Hausdorff space must be sober, and any sober space must be T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.
* ''X'' is '''[[weak Hausdorff space|weak Hausdorff]]''' if, for every continuous map ''f'' to ''X'' from a compact Hausdorff space, the image of ''f'' is closed in ''X''. Any Hausdorff space must be weak Hausdorff, and any weak Hausdorff space must be T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
* ''X'' is '''[[semiregular space|semiregular]]''' if the [[regular open set]]s form a [[base (topology)|base]] for the open sets of ''X''. Any regular space must also be semiregular.
* ''X'' is '''[[quasi-regular space|quasi-regular]]''' if for any nonempty open set ''G'', there is a nonempty open set ''H'' such that the closure of ''H'' is contained in ''G''.
* ''X'' is '''[[fully normal space|fully normal]]''' if every [[open cover]] has an open [[star refinement]]. ''X'' is '''[[fully T4 space|fully T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]''', or '''fully normal Hausdorff''', if it is both T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and fully normal. Every fully normal space is normal and every fully T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; space is T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Moreover, one can show that every fully T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; space is [[paracompact]]. In fact, fully normal spaces actually have more to do with paracompactness than with the usual separation axioms.

[[File:6n-graf.svg|thumb|(6, 4, 5, 1) and (6, 4, 3, 2, 1) are both paths between vertices 6 and 1]]
[[File:Shortest path with direct weights.svg|thumb|250px|Shortest path (A, C, E, D, F) between vertices A and F in the weighted directed graph]]
In [[graph theory]], the '''shortest path problem''' is the problem of finding a [[path (graph theory)|path]] between two [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] (or nodes) in a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] such that the sum of the [[Glossary of graph theory terms#weighted graph|weights]] of its constituent edges is minimized.

The problem of finding the shortest path between two intersections on a road map may be modeled as a special case of the shortest path problem in graphs, where the vertices correspond to intersections and the edges correspond to road segments, each weighted by the length of the segment.

==Definition==
The shortest path problem can be defined for [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] whether [[Graph (discrete mathematics)#Undirected graph|undirected]], [[Graph (discrete mathematics)#Directed graph|directed]], or [[Mixed graph|mixed]].
It is defined here for undirected graphs; for directed graphs the definition of path
requires that consecutive vertices be connected by an appropriate directed edge.

Two vertices are adjacent when they are both incident to a common edge.
A [[Path (graph theory)|path]] in an undirected graph is a [[sequence]] of vertices &lt;math&gt;P = ( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n ) \in V \times V \times \cdots \times V&lt;/math&gt;
such that &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; is adjacent to &lt;math&gt;v_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i &lt; n&lt;/math&gt;.
Such a path &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is called a path of length &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;
from &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v_n&lt;/math&gt;.
(The &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; are variables; their numbering here relates to their position in the sequence and needs not to relate to any canonical labeling of the vertices.)

Let &lt;math&gt;e_{i, j}&lt;/math&gt; be the edge incident to both &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_j&lt;/math&gt;. Given a [[Function (mathematics)#Real-valued functions|real-valued]] weight function &lt;math&gt;f: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, and an undirected (simple) graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, the shortest path from &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v'&lt;/math&gt; is the path &lt;math&gt;P = ( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n )&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;v_1 = v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_n = v'&lt;/math&gt;) that over all possible &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; minimizes the sum &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i =1}^{n-1} f(e_{i, i+1}).&lt;/math&gt; When each edge in the graph has unit weight or &lt;math&gt;f: E \rightarrow \{1\}&lt;/math&gt;, this is equivalent to finding the path with fewest edges.

The problem is also sometimes called the '''single-pair shortest path problem''', to distinguish it from the following variations:
* The '''single-source shortest path problem''', in which we have to find shortest paths from a source vertex ''v'' to all other vertices in the graph.
* The '''single-destination shortest path problem''', in which we have to find shortest paths from all vertices in the directed graph to a single destination vertex ''v''. This can be reduced to the single-source shortest path problem by reversing the arcs in the directed graph.
* The '''all-pairs shortest path problem''', in which we have to find shortest paths between every pair of vertices ''v'', ''v' '' in the graph.

These generalizations have significantly more efficient algorithms than the simplistic approach of running a single-pair shortest path algorithm on all relevant pairs of vertices.

==Algorithms==
The most important algorithms for solving this problem are:
* [[Dijkstra's algorithm]] solves the single-source shortest path problem with non-negative edge weight.
* [[Bellman–Ford algorithm]] solves the single-source problem if edge weights may be negative.
* [[A* search algorithm]] solves for single pair shortest path using heuristics to try to speed up the search.
* [[Floyd–Warshall algorithm]] solves all pairs shortest paths.
* [[Johnson's algorithm]] solves all pairs shortest paths, and may be faster than Floyd–Warshall on [[sparse graph]]s.
* [[Viterbi algorithm]] solves the shortest stochastic path problem with an additional probabilistic weight on each node.

Additional algorithms and associated evaluations may be found in {{harvtxt|Cherkassky|Goldberg|Radzik|1996}}.

===Planar directed graphs with arbitrary weights===

==All-pairs shortest paths==
The all-pairs shortest path problem finds the shortest paths between every pair of vertices {{mvar|v}}, {{mvar|v'}} in the graph.  The all-pairs shortest paths problem for unweighted directed graphs was introduced by {{harvtxt|Shimbel|1953}}, who observed that it could be solved by a linear number of matrix multiplications that takes a total time of {{math|''O''(''V''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.

==Applications==
Shortest path algorithms are applied to automatically find directions between physical locations, such as driving directions on [[web mapping]] websites like [[MapQuest]] or [[Google Maps]]. For this application fast specialized algorithms are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Fast route planning|first=Peter|last=Sanders|authorlink=Peter Sanders (computer scientist)|publisher=Google Tech Talk|date=March 23, 2009|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0ErpE8tQbw|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one represents a nondeterministic [[abstract machine]] as a graph where vertices describe states and edges describe possible transitions, shortest path algorithms can be used to find an optimal sequence of choices to reach a certain goal state, or to establish lower bounds on the time needed to reach a given state. For example, if vertices represent the states of a puzzle like a [[Rubik's Cube]] and each directed edge corresponds to a single move or turn, shortest path algorithms can be used to find a solution that uses the minimum possible number of moves.

In a [[Computer network|networking]] or [[Telecommunications network|telecommunications]] mindset, this shortest path problem is sometimes called the min-delay path problem and usually tied with a [[widest path problem]]. For example, the algorithm may seek the shortest (min-delay) widest path, or widest shortest (min-delay) path.

A more lighthearted application is the games of "[[six degrees of separation]]" that try to find the shortest path in graphs like movie stars appearing in the same film.

Other applications, often studied in [[operations research]], include plant and facility layout, [[robotics]], [[transportation]], and [[Very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1145/242224.242246 |title=Developing algorithms and software for geometric path planning problems |date=December 1996 |first=Danny Z. |last=Chen |journal=ACM Computing Surveys |volume=28 |issue=4es |pages=18 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Road networks===
A road network can be considered as a graph with positive weights. The nodes represent road junctions and each edge of the graph is associated with a road segment between two junctions. The weight of an edge may correspond to the length of the associated road segment, the time needed to traverse the segment, or the cost of traversing the segment. Using directed edges it is also possible to model one-way streets. Such graphs are special in the sense that some edges are more important than others for long distance travel (e.g. highways). This property has been formalized using the notion of highway dimension.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, Ittai; Fiat, Amos; [[Andrew V. Goldberg|Goldberg, Andrew V.]]; Werneck, Renato F. [http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/115272/soda10.pdf%20research.microsoft.com/pubs/115272/soda10.pdf "Highway Dimension, Shortest Paths, and Provably Efficient Algorithms"]. ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, pages 782–793, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a great number of algorithms that exploit this property and are therefore able to compute the shortest path a lot quicker than would be possible on general graphs.

All of these algorithms work in two phases. In the first phase, the graph is preprocessed without knowing the source or target node. The second phase is the query phase. In this phase, source and target node are known.The idea is that the road network is static, so the preprocessing phase can be done once and used for a large number of queries on the same road network.

The algorithm with the fastest known query time is called hub labeling and is able to compute shortest path on the road networks of Europe or the USA in a fraction of a microsecond.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, Ittai; Delling, Daniel; [[Andrew V. Goldberg|Goldberg, Andrew V.]]; Werneck, Renato F. [http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/142356/HL-TR.pdf research.microsoft.com/pubs/142356/HL-TR.pdf "A Hub-Based Labeling Algorithm for Shortest Paths on Road Networks"]. Symposium on Experimental Algorithms, pages 230–241, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Other techniques that have been used are:

* ALT (A* search, landmarks, and [[triangle inequality]])
* Arc flags
* [[Contraction hierarchies]]
* Transit node routing
* Reach-based pruning
* Labeling

==Related problems==
For shortest path problems in [[computational geometry]], see [[Euclidean shortest path]].

The [[traveling salesman problem|travelling salesman problem]] is the problem of finding the shortest path that goes through every vertex exactly once, and returns to the start.  Unlike the shortest path problem, which can be solved in polynomial time in graphs without negative cycles, the travelling salesman problem is [[NP-complete]] and, as such, is believed not to be efficiently solvable for large sets of data (see [[P = NP problem]]).  The problem of [[Longest path problem|finding the longest path]] in a graph is also NP-complete.

The [[Canadian traveller problem]] and the stochastic shortest path problem are generalizations where either the graph isn't completely known to the mover, changes over time, or where actions (traversals) are probabilistic.

The shortest multiple disconnected path &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cpc.2005.01.020 |title=Shortest multiple disconnected path for the analysis of entanglements in two- and three-dimensional polymeric systems |year=2005 |first=Martin |last=Kroger |journal=Computer Physics Communications |volume=168 |issue=3 |pages=209–232 |ref=harv|bibcode=2005CoPhC.168..209K }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a representation of the primitive path network within the framework of [[Reptation theory]].

The [[widest path problem]] seeks a path so that the minimum label of any edge is as large as possible.

===Strategic shortest-paths===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
Sometimes, the edges in a graph have personalities: each edge has its own selfish interest. An example is a communication network, in which each edge is a computer that possibly belongs to a different person. Different computers have different transmission speeds, so every edge in the network has a numeric weight equal to the number of milliseconds it takes to transmit a message. Our goal is to send a message between two points in the network in the shortest time possible. If we know the transmission-time of each computer (the weight of each edge), then we can use a standard shortest-paths algorithm. If we do not know the transmission times, then we have to ask each computer to tell us its transmission-time. But, the computers may be selfish: a computer might tell us that its transmission time is very long, so that we will not bother it with our messages.  A possible solution to this problem is to use [[Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanism#quickest paths|a variant of the VCG mechanism]], which gives the computers an incentive to reveal their true weights.

==Linear programming formulation==
There is a natural [[linear programming]] formulation for the shortest path problem, given below. It is very simple compared to most other uses of linear programs in [[discrete optimization]], however it illustrates connections to other concepts.

Given a directed graph (''V'', ''A'') with source node ''s'', target node ''t'', and cost ''w&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' for each edge (''i'', ''j'') in ''A'', consider the program with variables ''x&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''

:minimize &lt;math&gt;\sum_{ij \in A} w_{ij} x_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; subject to &lt;math&gt;x \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; and for all ''i'', &lt;math&gt;\sum_j x_{ij} - \sum_j x_{ji} = \begin{cases}1, &amp;\text{if }i=s;\\ -1, &amp;\text{if }i=t;\\ 0, &amp;\text{ otherwise.}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The intuition behind this is that &lt;math&gt;x_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is an indicator variable for whether edge (''i'', ''j'') is part of the shortest path: 1 when it is, and 0 if it is not. We wish to select the set of edges with minimal weight, subject to the constraint that this set forms a path from ''s'' to ''t'' (represented by the equality constraint: for all vertices except ''s'' and ''t'' the number of incoming and outcoming edges that are part of the path must be the same (i.e., that it should be a path from s to t).

This LP has the special property that it is integral; more specifically, every [[Linear programming#Theory|basic optimal solution]] (when one exists) has all variables equal to 0 or 1, and the set of edges whose variables equal 1 form an ''s''-''t'' [[dipath]]. See Ahuja et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ravindra K. |last=Ahuja |author1-link=Ravindra K. Ahuja |first2=Thomas L. |last2=Magnanti |author2-link=Thomas L. Magnanti |first3=James B. |last3=Orlin |author3-link=James B. Orlin | title= Network Flows: Theory, Algorithms and Applications | publisher=Prentice Hall | year=1993 | isbn=0-13-617549-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; for one proof, although the origin of this approach dates back to mid-20th century.

The dual for this linear program is
:maximize ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''y''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; subject to for all ''ij'', ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;le; ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;
and feasible duals correspond to the concept of a [[consistent heuristic]] for the [[A-star algorithm|A* algorithm]] for shortest paths. For any feasible dual ''y'' the [[reduced cost]]s &lt;math&gt;w'_{ij} = w_{ij} - y_j + y_i&lt;/math&gt; are nonnegative and [[A-star algorithm|A*]] essentially runs [[Dijkstra's algorithm]] on these reduced costs.

==General algebraic framework on semirings: the algebraic path problem==
{{expand section|date=August 2014}}
Many problems can be framed as a form of the shortest path for some suitably substituted notions of addition along a path and taking the minimum.  The general approach to these is to consider the two operations to be those of a [[semiring]]. Semiring multiplication is done along the path, and the addition is between paths. This general framework is known as the [[algebraic path problem]].&lt;ref name="BarasTheodorakopoulos2010"&gt;{{cite book |first1=John |last1=Baras |first2=George |last2=Theodorakopoulos |title=Path Problems in Networks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fZJeAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9|date=4 April 2010|publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers|isbn=978-1-59829-924-3|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mehryar |last=Mohri |author-link=Mehryar Mohri |url=http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/jalc.pdf |title=Semiring frameworks and algorithms for shortest-distance problems |journal=[[Journal of Automata, Languages and Combinatorics]] |volume=7 |issue=3 |date=January 2002 |pages=321–350}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~run/talks/2008-06-05-Bern-Jonczy.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821054702/http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~run/talks/2008-06-05-Bern-Jonczy.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the classic shortest-path algorithms (and new ones) can be formulated as solving linear systems over such algebraic structures.&lt;ref name="GondranMinoux2008"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Michel |last1=Gondran |first2=Michel |last2=Minoux |title=Graphs, Dioids and Semirings: New Models and Algorithms|year=2008|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-75450-5|at=chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, an even more general framework for solving these (and much less obviously related problems) has been developed under the banner of [[valuation algebra]]s&lt;!-- not just [[valuation (algebra)]]! --&gt;.&lt;ref name="PoulyKohlas2012"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Marc |last1=Pouly |first2=Jürg |last2=Kohlas |title=Generic Inference: A Unifying Theory for Automated Reasoning|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-01086-0|at=Chapter 6.

==Shortest path in stochastic time-dependent networks==
In real-life situations, the transportation network is usually stochastic and time-dependent. In fact, a traveler traversing a link daily may experiences different travel times on that link due not only to the fluctuations in travel demand (origin-destination matrix) but also due to such incidents as work zones, bad weather conditions, accidents and vehicle breakdowns. As a result, a stochastic time-dependent (STD) network is a more realistic representation of an actual road network compared with the deterministic one.&lt;ref&gt;Loui, R.P., 1983. Optimal paths in graphs with stochastic or multidimensional weights. Communications of the ACM, 26(9), pp.670-676.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rajabi-Bahaabadi |first1=Mojtaba |first2=Afshin |last2=Shariat-Mohaymany |first3=Mohsen |last3=Babaei |first4=Chang Wook |last4=Ahn |title=Multi-objective path finding in stochastic time-dependent road networks using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm |journal=Expert Systems with Applications |date=2015 |volume=42 |issue=12|pages=5056–5064 |doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2015.02.046 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite considerable progress during the course of the past decade, it remains a controversial question how an optimal path should be defined and identified in stochastic road networks. In other words, there is no unique definition of an optimal path under uncertainty. One possible and common answer to this question is to find a path with the minimum expected travel time. The main advantage of using this approach is that efficient shortest path algorithms introduced for the deterministic networks can be readily employed to identify the path with the minimum expected travel time in a stochastic network. However, the resulting optimal path identified by this approach may not be reliable, because this approach fails to address travel time variability. To tackle this issue some researchers use distribution of travel time instead of expected value of it so they find the probability distribution of total travelling time using different optimization methods such as [[dynamic programming]] and [[Dijkstra's algorithm]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Olya |first1=Mohammad Hessam |title=Finding shortest path in a combined exponential – gamma probability distribution arc length |journal=International Journal of Operational Research |date=2014 |volume=21 |issue=1|pages=25–37 |doi=10.1504/IJOR.2014.064020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These methods use [[stochastic optimization]], specifically stochastic dynamic programming to find the shortest path in networks with probabilistic arc length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Olya |first1=Mohammad Hessam |title=Applying Dijkstra’s algorithm for general shortest path problem with normal probability distribution arc length |journal=International Journal of Operational Research |date=2014 |volume=21 |issue=2|pages=143–154 |doi=10.1504/IJOR.2014.064541 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that the concept of travel time reliability is used interchangeably with travel time variability in the transportation research literature, so that, in general, one can say that the higher the variability in travel time, the lower the reliability would be, and vice versa.

In order to account for travel time reliability more accurately, two common alternative definitions for an optimal path under uncertainty have been suggested. Some have introduced the concept of the most reliable path, aiming to maximize the probability of arriving on time or earlier than a given travel time budget. Others, alternatively, have put forward the concept of an α-reliable path based on which they intended to minimize the travel time budget required to ensure a pre-specified on-time arrival probability.

{{Graph families defined by their automorphisms}}

In [[graph theory]], a '''strongly regular graph'''  is defined as follows.  Let ''G'' = (''V'', ''E'') be a [[regular graph]] with ''v'' vertices and degree ''k''.  ''G'' is said to be '''strongly regular''' if there are also [[integer]]s λ and μ such that:

* Every two [[adjacent vertices]] have λ common neighbours.
* Every two non-adjacent vertices have μ common neighbours.

A graph of this kind is sometimes said to be an srg(''v'', ''k'', λ, μ). Strongly regular graphs were introduced by [[Raj Chandra Bose]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.pjm/1103035734, R. C. Bose, Strongly regular graphs, partial geometries and partially balanced designs, Pacific
J. Math 13 (1963) 389–419. (p. 122)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors exclude graphs which satisfy the definition trivially, namely those graphs which are the disjoint union of one or more equal-sized [[complete graph]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.cwi.nl/~aeb/math/ipm.pdf Brouwer, Andries E; Haemers, Willem H. ''Spectra of Graphs''. p. 101] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316102909/http://homepages.cwi.nl/~aeb/math/ipm.pdf |date=2012-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Godsil, Chris; Royle, Gordon. ''Algebraic Graph Theory''. Springer-Verlag New York, 2001, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; and their [[complement graph|complements]], the complete [[multipartite graph]]s with equal-sized independent sets.

The [[complement graph|complement]] of an srg(''v'', ''k'', λ, μ) is also strongly regular. It is an srg(''v'', ''v−k''−1, ''v''−2−2''k''+μ, ''v''−2''k''+λ).

A strongly regular graph is a [[distance-regular graph]] with diameter 2 whenever μ is non-zero.

==Properties==

===Relationship between Parameters===
The four parameters in an srg(''v'', ''k'', λ, μ) are not independent and must obey the following relation:
:&lt;math&gt;(v-k-1)\mu = k(k-\lambda-1)&lt;/math&gt;
The above relation can be derived very easily through a counting argument as follows:
# Imagine the nodes of the graph to lie in three levels. Pick any node as the root node, in Level 0. Then its ''k'' neighbor nodes lie in Level 1, and all other nodes lie in Level 2.
# Nodes in Level 1 are directly connected to the root, hence they must have λ other neighbors in common with the root, and these common neighbors must also be in Level 1. Since each node has degree ''k'', there are &lt;math&gt;k-\lambda-1&lt;/math&gt; edges remaining for each Level 1 node to connect to nodes in Level 2. Therefore, there are &lt;math&gt;k\times(k-\lambda-1)&lt;/math&gt; edges between Level 1 and Level 2.
# Nodes in Level 2 are not directly connected to the root, hence they must have μ common neighbors with the root, and these common neighbors must all be in Level 1. There are &lt;math&gt;(v-k-1)&lt;/math&gt; nodes in Level 2, and each is connected to μ nodes in Level 1. Therefore the number of edges between Level 1 and Level 2 is &lt;math&gt;(v-k-1)\times\mu&lt;/math&gt;.
# Equating the two expressions for the edges between Level 1 and Level 2, the relation follows.

===Adjacency Matrix===
Let ''I'' denote the [[identity matrix]] and let ''J'' denote the [[matrix of ones]], both matrices of order ''v''.  The [[adjacency matrix]] ''A'' of a strongly regular graph satisfies two equations. First:
:&lt;math&gt;AJ = JA = kJ,&lt;/math&gt;
which is a trivial restatement of the regularity requirement. This shows that ''k'' is an eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix with the all-ones eigenvector. Second is a quadratic equation,

:&lt;math&gt;{A}^{2} = k{I} + \lambda{A} + \mu({J-I-A})&lt;/math&gt;

which expresses strong regularity. The ''ij''-th element of the left hand side gives the number of two-step paths from ''i'' to ''j''. The first term of the RHS gives the number of self-paths from ''i'' to ''i'', namely ''k'' edges out and back in. The second term gives the number of two-step paths when ''i'' and ''j'' are directly connected. The third term gives the corresponding value when ''i'' and ''j'' are not connected. Since the three cases are [[mutually exclusive]] and [[collectively exhaustive]], the simple additive equality follows.

Conversely, a graph whose adjacency matrix satisfies both of the above conditions and which is not a complete or null graph is a strongly regular graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=P.J.|last1=Cameron|first2=J.H.|last2=van Lint|title=Designs, Graphs, Codes and their Links|publisher=Cambridge University Press|series=London Mathematical Society Student Texts 22|year=1991|isbn=978-0-521-42385-4|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eigenvalues===
The adjacency matrix of the graph has exactly three [[eigenvalue]]s:
*''k'', whose [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] is 1 (as seen above)
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\left[(\lambda-\mu)+\sqrt{(\lambda-\mu)^2 + 4(k-\mu)}\right],&lt;/math&gt; whose multiplicity is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} \left[(v-1)-\frac{2k+(v-1)(\lambda-\mu)}{\sqrt{(\lambda-\mu)^2 + 4(k-\mu)}}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\left[(\lambda-\mu)-\sqrt{(\lambda-\mu)^2 + 4(k-\mu)}\right],&lt;/math&gt; whose multiplicity is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} \left[(v-1)+\frac{2k+(v-1)(\lambda-\mu)}{\sqrt{(\lambda-\mu)^2 + 4(k-\mu)}}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
As the multiplicities must be integers, their expressions provide further constraints on the values of ''v'', ''k'', ''μ'', and ''λ'', related to the so-called ''Krein conditions''.

Strongly regular graphs for which &lt;math&gt;2k+(v-1)(\lambda-\mu) = 0&lt;/math&gt; are called [[conference graph]]s because of their connection with symmetric [[conference matrix|conference matrices]]. Their parameters reduce to

::&lt;math&gt;\text{srg}\left(v, \tfrac{1}{2}(v-1), \tfrac{1}{4}(v-5), \tfrac{1}{4}(v-1)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Strongly regular graphs for which &lt;math&gt;2k+(v-1)(\lambda-\mu) \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; have integer eigenvalues with unequal multiplicities.

Conversely, a connected regular graph with only three eigenvalues is strongly regular.&lt;ref&gt;Godsil, Chris; Royle, Gordon. ''Algebraic Graph Theory''. Springer-Verlag, New York, 2001, Lemma 10.2.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* The [[Cycle graph|cycle]] of length 5 is an srg(5, 2, 0, 1).
* The [[Petersen graph]] is an srg(10, 3, 0, 1).
* The [[Clebsch graph]] is an srg(16, 5, 0, 2).
* The [[Shrikhande graph]] is an srg(16, 6, 2, 2) which is not a [[distance-transitive graph]].
* The ''n''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''n'' square [[rook's graph]], i.e., the line graph of a balanced complete bipartite graph ''K&lt;sub&gt;n,n&lt;/sub&gt;'', is an srg(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2, ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2, 2).  The parameters for ''n''=4 coincide with those of the Shrikhande graph, but the two graphs are not isomorphic.
* The [[line graph]] of a complete graph ''K&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an srg(&lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{2}, 2(n-2), n-2, 4&lt;/math&gt;).
* The [[Chang graphs]] are srg(28, 12, 6, 4), the same as the line graph of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, but these four graphs are not isomorphic.
* The [[line graph]] of a [[generalized quadrangle]] GQ(2, 4) is an srg(27, 10, 1, 5). In fact every generalized quadrangle of order (s, t) gives a strongly regular graph in this way: to wit, an srg((s+1)(st+1), s(t+1), s-1, t+1).
* The [[Schläfli graph]] is an srg(27, 16, 10, 8).&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld | urlname=SchlaefliGraph | title=Schläfli graph}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Hoffman–Singleton graph]] is an srg(50, 7, 0, 1).
* The [[Sims-Gewirtz graph]] is an (56, 10, 0, 2).
* The [[Higman–Sims graph|M&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; graph]] is an srg(77, 16, 0, 4).
* The [[Brouwer–Haemers graph]] is an srg(81, 20, 1, 6).
* The [[Higman–Sims graph]] is an srg(100, 22, 0, 6).
* The [[Local McLaughlin graph]] is an srg(162, 56, 10, 24).

[[File:Chow test example.png|250px|thumbnail|right|[[Linear regression]] with a structural break]]
In [[econometrics]], a '''structural break''', or '''structural change''', is an unexpected shift in a [[time series]] that can lead to huge [[forecasting]] errors and unreliability of the [[Economic model|model]] in general.&lt;ref name=guj&gt;{{cite book |last=Gujarati |first=Damodar |title=Basic Econometrics |year=2007 |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill |location=New Delhi |isbn=0-07-066005-0 |pages=278–284}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue was popularised by [[David Hendry]], who argued that lack of stability of coefficients frequently caused forecast failure, and therefore we must routinely test for structural stability.  Structural stability&amp;nbsp;− i.e., the time-invariance of regression coefficients&amp;nbsp;− is a central issue in all applications of [[linear regression]] models.&lt;ref name="Sup-MZ test"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Ahmed | first1=Mumtaz | last2=Haider | first2=Gulfam | last3=Zaman | first3=Asad | title=Detecting structural change with heteroskedasticity|journal=Communications in Statistics – Theory and Methods | date= October 2016 | pages=1–10 | doi=10.1080/03610926.2016.1235200 | quote = The hypothesis of structural stability that the regression coefficients do not change over time is central to all applications of linear regression models.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A single break in mean with a known breakpoint===

For linear regression models, the [[Chow test]] is often used to test for a single break in mean at a known time period {{math|''K''}} for {{math|''K''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;[1,''T'']}}.&lt;ref name="Dating breaks in labor productivity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Greene Econometrics – Chow test" /&gt; This test assesses whether the coefficients in a regression model are the same for periods {{math|[1,2,&amp;nbsp;...,''K'']}} and {{math|[''K''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,''T'']}}.&lt;ref name="Greene Econometrics – Chow test" /&gt;

===Other forms of structural breaks===

Other challenges occur where there are:
:Case 1: a known number of breaks in mean with unknown break points;
:Case 2: an unknown number of breaks in mean with unknown break points;
:Case 3: breaks in variance.

The [[Chow test]] is not applicable in these situations, since it only applies to models with a known breakpoint and where the error variance remains constant before and after the break.&lt;ref name=guj/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dating breaks in labor productivity"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hansen | first1=Bruce E | title=The New Econometrics of Structural Change: Dating Breaks in U.S. Labor Productivity|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives | date=November 2001 | volume=15 | issue=4 | pages=117–128 | doi=10.1257/jep.15.4.117 | url=http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.15.4.117 | accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greene Econometrics – Chow test"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Greene | first1=William | title=Econometric Analysis | date=2012 | publisher=Pearson Education | isbn=9780273753568 | pages=208–211 | edition=7th | chapter=Section 6.4: Modeling and testing for a structural break | quote = An important assumption made in using the Chow test is that the disturbance variance is the same in both (or all) regressions.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;6.4.4 TESTS OF STRUCTURAL BREAK WITH UNEQUAL VARIANCES&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;In a small or moderately sized sample, the Wald test has the unfortunate property that the probability of a type I error is persistently larger than the critical level we use to carry it out. (That is, we shall too frequently reject the null hypothesis that the parameters are the same in the subsamples.) We should be using a larger critical value. Ohtani and Kobayashi (1986) have devised a “bounds” test that gives a partial remedy for the problem.&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the [[CUSUM]] (cumulative sum) and CUSUM-sq (CUSUM squared) tests can be used to test the constancy of the coefficients in a model. The bounds test can also be used.&lt;ref name="Greene Econometrics – Chow test" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pesaran |first=M. H. |last2=Shin |first2=Y. |last3=Smith |first3=R.

The '''MZ test''' developed by Maasoumi, Zaman, and Ahmed (2010) allows for the simultaneous detection of one or more breaks in both mean and variance at a ''known'' break point.&lt;ref name="Sup-MZ test" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MZ test"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maasoumi|first1=Esfandiar|last2=Zaman|first2=Asad|last3=Ahmed|first3=Mumtaz|title=Tests for structural change, aggregation, and homogeneity|journal=Economic Modelling|date=November 2010|volume=27|issue=6|pages=1382–1391|doi=10.1016/j.econmod.2010.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''sup-MZ test''' developed by Ahmed, Haider, and Zaman (2016) is a generalization of the MZ test which allows for the detection of breaks in mean and variance at an ''unknown'' break point.&lt;ref name="Sup-MZ test" /&gt; &lt;!--Need to elaborate more on the MZ test and Sup-MZ test here .--&gt;&lt;!--

Instead of assuming IID Normal errors as in standard regression, they created tests when errors form ARMA process and even more complex stochastic structures. This literature, and its applications, are reviewed in Hansen, B. (2001).&lt;ref name="Dating breaks in labor productivity" /&gt;

HOWEVER, all of this literature makes the same assumption that structural change occurs in the regression coefficients but NOT in the error process. Even the very complex error processes, with heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation (HAC), do not change in time. Recently, Maasoumi, Zaman, and Ahmad (2010) published a paper (“Tests for Structural Change, Homogeneity, and Aggregation” Economic Modelling  Vol 27 no.6  (2010): 1382–1391) which relaxes this assumption and allows variances to change at the breakpoint, while also allowing for multiple known breakpoints. This test is called the MZ test by the authors. This test requires the breakpoints to be specified in advance. On the pattern of the rolling Chow, this test can also be used to detect unknown breakpoints by using it at all possible breakpoints, and then taking the maximum of all the statistics, leading to the sup MZ test. The performance of this test was evaluated recently by Ahmed,Haider, &amp; Zaman (2016)&lt;ref name="Ahmed, Haider, &amp; Zaman (2016)"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Mumtaz Ahmed and Gulfam Haider and Asad Zaman| title = Detecting structural change with heteroskedasticity| journal = Communications in Statistics – Theory and Methods| volume = 0| number = 0|pages = 1–10|year  = 2016|publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis|doi = 10.1080/03610926.2016.1235200|url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical evaluations shows that small changes in variance across the breakpoint cause significant deterioration in performance of the sup F test. Of course the sup MZ test is designed for this situation and hence works much better. Empirical evaluation was done by taking several macroeconomic series and testing them for structural change using both sup F and sup MZ. In these GNP series, tests indicated that structural change frequently involved both regression coefficients and the variance, leading to substantially superior performance of the sup MZ.

===Tests for multiple breaks===
The MZ test is designed to handle the (unlikely) case that multiple breaks all occur at known breakpoints. There is a vast literature on more complicated cases. The simpler case arises when the number of breakpoints is known but their position is unknown. The more difficult case is where both the number of breakpoints, and their position is unknown. For these cases, the sup-Wald, sup-LM, and sup-LR tests developed by [[Donald Andrews|Andrews]] (1993, 2003) may be used to test for parameter instability when the change points (the structural break locations) are unknown.&lt;ref name="Andrews 1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrews Corrigendum" /&gt;
--&gt;

===Structural breaks in cointegration models===

For a [[cointegration]] model, the Gregory–Hansen test (1996) can be used for one unknown structural break,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gregory |first=Allan |last2=Hansen |first2=Bruce |year=1996 |title=Tests for Cointegration in Models with Regime and Trend Shifts |journal=Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=555–560 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0084.1996.mp58003008.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hatemi–J test (2006) can be used for two unknown breaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hacker |first=R. Scott |last2=Hatemi-J |first2=Abdulnasser |year=2006 |title=Tests for Causality between Integrated Variables Using Asymptotic and Bootstrap Distributions: Theory and Application |journal=[[Applied Economics (journal)|Applied Economics]] |volume=38 |issue=15 |pages=1489–1500 |doi=10.1080/00036840500405763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistical packages==

There are several [[statistical packages]] that can be used to find structural breaks, including [[R (programming language)|R]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christian |last=Kleiber |first2=Achim |last2=Zeileis |title=Applied Econometrics with R |location=New York |publisher=Springer |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-387-77316-2 |pages=169–176 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=86rWI7WzFScC&amp;pg=PA169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GAUSS]], and [[Stata]], among others.

[[Image:Stuttering Equivalence.pdf|thumb|The paths &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi'&lt;/math&gt; are stuttering equivalent.]]

:&lt;math&gt;\pi\sim_{st}\pi'&lt;/math&gt;, 

can be seen as a partitioning of path &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi'&lt;/math&gt; into blocks, so that states in the &lt;math&gt;k^{\mathrm{th}}&lt;/math&gt; block of one path are labeled (&lt;math&gt;L(\sdot)&lt;/math&gt;) the same as states in the &lt;math&gt;k^{\mathrm{th}}&lt;/math&gt; block of the other path. Corresponding blocks may have different lengths.

Formally, this can be expressed as two infinite paths &lt;math&gt;\pi=s_0, s_1, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi'=r_0, r_1, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; which are stuttering equivalent (&lt;math&gt;\pi \sim_{st} \pi'&lt;/math&gt;) if there are two infinite sequences of integers &lt;math&gt;0 = i_0 &lt; i_1 &lt; i_2 &lt; \ldots&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 = j_0 &lt; j_1 &lt; j_2 &lt; \ldots&lt;/math&gt; such that for every block &lt;math&gt;k \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;L(s_{i_k}) = L(s_{i_k+1}) = \ldots = L(s_{i_{k+1}-1}) = L(r_{j_k}) = L(r_{j_k+1}) = \ldots = L(r_{j_{k+1}-1})&lt;/math&gt;.

Stuttering equivalence is not the same as [[bisimulation]], since bisimulation cannot capture the semantics of the 'eventually' (or 'finally') operator found in [[Linear temporal logic|linear temporal]]/[[Computation tree logic|computation tree logic(branching time logic)]]([[modal logic]]). So-called ''branching bisimulation'' has to be used.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2438">A '''symmetry element''' is a point of reference about which [[symmetry operation]]s can take place. In particular, symmetry elements can be identities, mirror planes, axes of rotation (both proper and improper), and centers of inversion.&lt;ref name="Mortimer2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert G.

==Identity==

The identity symmetry element is found in all objects and is denoted '''E'''.&lt;ref&gt;Glazer, Michael; Burns, Gerald; Glazer, Alexander. Space groups for solid state scientists.&lt;/ref&gt; It corresponds to an operation of doing nothing to the object.

==Mirror planes==

Mirror planes are denoted by '''σ'''. In particular, a vertical mirror plane is denoted '''σ{{sub|v}}'''.

==[[Cyclic symmetry]]==

Cyclic symmetry, also known as radial symmetry, is represented by an axis about which the object rotates in its corresponding symmetry operation. For proper axes of rotation, cyclic symmetry is denoted as '''C{{sub|n}}''', where n is the order of rotation.&lt;ref&gt;Glazer, Michael; Burns, Gerald; Glazer, Alexander. Space groups for solid state scientists.&lt;/ref&gt;
Improper rotation, also known as [[screw axis]] symmetry, is denoted by '''S{{sub|n}}'''. 
Improper rotation is the composition of a rotation axis and a mirror plane. In its symmetry operation, the object is rotated about the axis, then reflected across a mirror plane that is normal to the axis of rotation.

==Inversion==

For inversion, denoted '''i''', there must be a point in the center of an object that is the inversion center. In the inversion operation for 3D coordinates, the inversion center is the origin (0,0,0). When an object is inverted, the position vector of a point in an object, ⟨x,y,z⟩, is inverted to ⟨-x,-y,-z⟩.

In [[mathematics]], '''tensor calculus''' or '''tensor analysis''' is an extension of [[vector calculus]] to [[tensor field]]s ([[tensor]]s that may vary over a [[manifold]], e.g. in [[spacetime]]).

Developed by [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]] and his student [[Tullio Levi-Civita]], it was used by [[Albert Einstein]] to develop his [[theory of general relativity]]. Contrasted with the infinitesimal calculus, tensor calculus allows presentation of physics equations in a [[Manifest covariance|form that is independent]] of the [[coordinate chart|choice of coordinates]] on the manifold.

Tensor calculus has many real-life applications in [[physics]] and [[engineering]], including [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], [[continuum mechanics]], [[electromagnetism]] (see [[mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field]]), [[general relativity]] (see [[mathematics of general relativity]]),[[quantum field theory]].

In [[computability theory]], the '''Turing jump''' or '''Turing jump operator''', named for [[Alan Turing]], is an operation that assigns to each [[decision problem]] {{math|''X''}} a successively harder decision problem {{math|''X'' &amp;prime;}} with the property that {{math|''X'' &amp;prime;}} is not decidable by an [[oracle machine]] with an [[oracle (computer science)|oracle]] for {{math|''X''}}.

The operator is called a ''jump operator'' because it increases the [[Turing degree]] of the problem {{math|''X''}}. That is, the problem {{math|''X'' &amp;prime;}} is not [[Turing reducible]] to {{math|''X''}}. [[Post's theorem]] establishes a relationship between the Turing jump operator and the [[arithmetical hierarchy]] of sets of natural numbers. Informally, given a problem, the Turing jump returns the set of Turing machines which halt when given access to an oracle that solves that problem.

== Definition ==
The Turing jump of X can be thought of as an oracle to the [[Halting_problem#Generalized_to_oracle_machines|halting problem]] for [[oracle machine]]s with an oracle to X.

Formally, given a set {{math|''X''}} and a [[Gödel numbering]] {{math|φ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt;}} of the [[relative computability|{{math|''X''}}-computable]] functions, the '''Turing jump''' {{math|''X'' &amp;prime;}} of {{math|''X''}} is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;X'= \{x \mid \varphi_x^X(x) \ \mbox{is defined} \}.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''{{math|''n''}}th Turing jump''' {{math|''X''&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;}} is defined inductively by
:&lt;math&gt;X^{(0)} = X, \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;X^{(n+1)}=(X^{(n)})'. \,&lt;/math&gt;

The '''{{math|ω}} jump''' {{math|''X''&lt;sup&gt;(ω)&lt;/sup&gt;}} of {{math|''X''}} is the [[effective join]] of the sequence of sets {{math|''X''&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;}} for {{math|''n'' ∈ '''[[Natural numbers|N]]'''}}: &lt;!-- &lt;math&gt;\langle X^{(n)}\mid n \in \mathbb{N}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; --&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;X^{(\omega)} = \{p_i^k \mid i \in \mathbb{N} \text{ and } k \in X^{(i)}\},\,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} denotes the {{math|''i''}}th prime.

The notation {{math|0&amp;prime;}} or {{math|∅&amp;prime;}} is often used for the Turing jump of the empty set. It is read ''zero-jump'' or sometimes ''zero-prime''.

Similarly, {{math|0&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the {{math|''n''}}th jump of the empty set. For finite {{math|''n''}}, these sets are closely related to the [[arithmetic hierarchy]].

The jump can be iterated into transfinite ordinals: the sets {{math|0&lt;sup&gt;(α)&lt;/sup&gt;}} for {{math|α &amp;lt; ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;CK&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{math|ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;CK&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the [[Church–Kleene ordinal]], are closely related to the [[hyperarithmetic hierarchy]].  Beyond {{math|ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;CK&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the process can be continued through the countable ordinals of the [[constructible universe]], using set-theoretic methods (Hodes 1980).  The concept has also been generalized to extend to uncountable [[regular cardinal]]s (Lubarsky 1987).

== Examples ==

* The Turing jump {{math|0&amp;prime;}} of the empty set is Turing equivalent to the [[halting problem]].
* For each {{math|''n''}}, the set {{math|0&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;}} is [[m-complete]] at level &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; in the [[arithmetical hierarchy]] (by [[Post's theorem]]).
* The set of Gödel numbers of true formulas in the language of [[Peano arithmetic]] with a predicate for {{math|''X''}} is computable from {{math|''X''&lt;sup&gt;(ω)&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

== Properties ==

* {{math|''X'' &amp;prime;}} is {{math|''X''}}-[[computably enumerable]] but not {{math|''X''}}-[[computable function|computable]].
* If {{math|''A''}} is [[Turing degree|Turing equivalent]] to {{math|''B''}} then {{math|''A''&amp;prime;}} is Turing equivalent to {{math|''B''&amp;prime;}}.  The converse of this implication is not true.
* ([[Richard Shore|Shore]] and [[Theodore Slaman|Slaman]], 1999) The function mapping {{math|''X''}} to {{math|''X'' &amp;prime;}} is definable in the partial order of the Turing degrees.

Many properties of the Turing jump operator are discussed in the article on [[Turing degree]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10109">{{Short description|A type of metric space in which the triangle inequality is replaced by a stronger inequality using max in place of addition}}
In [[mathematics]], an '''ultrametric space''' is a [[metric space]] in which the [[triangle inequality]] is strengthened to &lt;math&gt;d(x,z)\leq\max\left\{d(x,y),d(y,z)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;. Sometimes the associated metric is also called a '''non-Archimedean metric''' or '''super-metric'''. Although some of the theorems for ultrametric spaces may seem strange at a first glance, they appear naturally in many applications.

== Formal definition ==

Formally, an ultrametric space is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of points &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; with an associated distance function (also called a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]])

:&lt;math&gt;d\colon M \times M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[real number]]s), such that for all &lt;math&gt;x,y,z\in M&lt;/math&gt;, one has:
# &lt;math&gt;d(x, y) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = 0&lt;/math&gt; [[iff]] &lt;math&gt;x=y&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = d(y, x)&lt;/math&gt; ('''symmetry''')
# &lt;math&gt;d(x, z) \le \max \left\{ d(x, y), d(y, z) \right\}&lt;/math&gt; ('''strong triangle''' or '''ultrametric inequality''').

In the case when &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a group (written additively) and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is generated by a [[length function]] &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|&lt;/math&gt;  (so that &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = \|x - y\|&lt;/math&gt;), the last property can be made stronger using the [[Wolfgang Krull|Krull]] sharpening&lt;ref&gt;Planet Math: [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/ultrametrictriangleinequality.html Ultrametric Triangle Inequality]&lt;/ref&gt; to:
: &lt;math&gt;\|x+y\|\le \max \left\{ \|x\|, \|y\| \right\}&lt;/math&gt; with equality if &lt;math&gt;\|x\| \ne \|y\|&lt;/math&gt;.

We want to prove that if &lt;math&gt;\|x+y\| \le \max \left\{ \|x\|, \|y\|\right\}&lt;/math&gt;, then the equality occurs if &lt;math&gt;\|x\| \ne \|y\|&lt;/math&gt;. [[Without loss of generality]], let us assume that &lt;math&gt;\|x\| &gt; \|y\|&lt;/math&gt;. This implies that &lt;math&gt;\|x + y\| \le \|x\|&lt;/math&gt;. But we can also compute &lt;math&gt;\|x\|=\|(x+y)-y\| \le \max \left\{ \|x+y\|, \|y\|\right\}&lt;/math&gt;. Now, the value of &lt;math&gt;\max \left\{ \|x+y\|, \|y\|\right\}&lt;/math&gt; cannot be &lt;math&gt;\|y\|&lt;/math&gt;, for if that is the case, we have &lt;math&gt;\|x\| \le \|y\|&lt;/math&gt; contrary to the initial assumption. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\max \left\{ \|x+y\|, \|y\|\right\}=\|x+y\|&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\|x\| \le \|x+y\|&lt;/math&gt;. Using the initial inequality, we have &lt;math&gt;\|x\| \le \|x + y\| \le \|x\|&lt;/math&gt; and therefore &lt;math&gt;\|x+y\| = \|x\|&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==
[[File:Strong_triangle_ineq.svg|thumb|400px|In the triangle on the right, the two bottom points x and y violate the condition d(x, y) ≤ max(d(x, z), d(y, z)).]]
From the above definition, one can conclude several typical properties of ultrametrics. For example, in an ultrametric space, for all &lt;math&gt;x,y,z\in M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r,s\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, at least one of the three equalities &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=d(y,z)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;d(x,z)=d(y,z)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=d(z,x)&lt;/math&gt; holds. That is, every triple of points in the space forms an [[isosceles triangle]], so the whole space is an [[isosceles set]].

In the following, the concept and notation of an [[open ball|(open) ball]] is the same as in the article about [[metric space]]s, i.e.
: &lt;math&gt;B(x;r)=\{y\in M|d(x,y)&lt;r\}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Every point inside a ball is its center, i.e. if &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)&lt;r&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;B(x;r)=B(y;r)&lt;/math&gt;.
* Intersecting balls are contained in each other, i.e. if &lt;math&gt;B(x;r)\cap B(y;s)&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty then either &lt;math&gt;B(x;r)\subseteq B(y;s)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B(y;s)\subseteq B(x;r)&lt;/math&gt;.
* All balls of strictly positive radius are both open and closed sets in the induced [[topology]]. That is, open balls are also closed, and closed balls (replace &lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt;) are also open.
* The set of all open balls with radius ''r'' and center in a closed ball of radius &lt;math&gt;r&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; forms a [[partition of a set|partition]] of the latter, and the mutual distance of two distinct open balls is again equal to &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

Proving these statements is an instructive exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Stack Exchange: [http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1141731/proving-an-ultrametric-space-and-its-properties Ultrametric Triangle Inequality]&lt;/ref&gt; All directly derive from the ultrametric triangle inequality. Note that, by the second statement, a ball may have several center points that have non-zero distance. The intuition behind such seemingly strange effects is that, due to the strong triangle inequality, distances in ultrametrics do not add up.

== Examples ==

* The [[discrete metric]] is an ultrametric.
* The [[p-adic numbers]] form a complete ultrametric space.
* Consider the [[formal language|set of words]] of arbitrary length (finite or infinite), Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, over some alphabet Σ. Define the distance between two different words to be 2&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n'' is the first place at which the words differ. The resulting metric is an ultrametric.
* The [[formal language|set of words]] with glued ends of the length n over some alphabet Σ is an ultrametric space with respect to the p-close distance. Two words x and y are p-close if any substring of p (p &lt; n) consecutive letters appears the same number of times (might be also zero) both in x and y.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

* If ''r''=(''r&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') is a sequence of [[real numbers]] [[decreasing]] to zero, then |''x''|&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; := [[lim sup]]&lt;sub&gt;''n''→∞&lt;/sub&gt; |''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''|&lt;sup&gt;''r&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/sup&gt; induces an ultrametric on the space of all complex sequences for which it is finite.

== Applications==
* A [[contraction mapping]] may then be thought of as a way of approximating the final result of a computation (which can be guaranteed to exist by the [[Banach fixed point theorem]]). Similar ideas can be found in [[domain theory]]. [[P-adic analysis]] makes heavy use of the ultrametric nature of the [[p-adic metric]].

Elsevier, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt; These algorithms require a constant-rate assumption and produce trees in which the distances from the root to every branch tip are equal. When [[DNA]], [[RNA]] and [[protein]] data are analyzed, the ultrametricity assumption is called the [[molecular clock]].

In [[computational geometry]], the '''Urquhart graph''' of a set of points in the plane, named after Roderick B. Urquhart, is obtained by removing the longest [[edge (geometry)|edge]] from each [[triangle]] in the [[Delaunay triangulation]].

The Urquhart graph was described by {{harvtxt|Urquhart|1980}}, who suggested that removing the longest edge from each Delaunay triangle would be a fast way of constructing the [[relative neighborhood graph]] (the graph connecting pairs of points ''p'' and ''q'' when there does not exist any third point ''r'' that is closer to both ''p'' and ''q'' than they are to each other). Since Delaunay triangulations can be constructed in time O(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n''), the same time bound holds for the Urquhart graph as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Like the relative neighborhood graph, the Urquhart graph of a set of points in [[general position]] contains the [[Euclidean minimum spanning tree]] of its points, from which it follows that it is a [[connected graph]].

'''Zeno's paradoxes''' are a set of [[philosophy|philosophical]] problems generally thought to have been devised by [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] (c. 490–430 BC) to support [[Parmenides]]' doctrine that contrary to the evidence of one's senses, the belief in [[Ontological pluralism|plurality]] and change is mistaken, and in particular that [[motion (physics)|motion]] is nothing but an [[illusion]].  It is usually assumed, based on [[Plato|Plato's]] [[Parmenides (dialogue)|''Parmenides'']] (128a–d), that Zeno took on the project of creating these [[paradox]]es because other philosophers had created paradoxes against Parmenides' view.  Thus Plato has Zeno say the purpose of the paradoxes "is to show that their hypothesis that existences are many, if properly followed up, leads to still more absurd results than the hypothesis that they are one."&lt;ref&gt;''Parmenides'' 128d&lt;/ref&gt; Plato has [[Socrates]] claim that Zeno and Parmenides were essentially arguing exactly the same point.&lt;ref&gt;''Parmenides'' 128a–b&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Zeno's nine surviving paradoxes (preserved in [[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's ''Physics'']]&lt;ref name=aristotle&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.html Aristotle's ''Physics''] "Physics" by Aristotle translated by R. P. Hardie and R. K. Gaye

and [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius's]] commentary thereon) are essentially equivalent to one another. Aristotle offered a refutation of some of them.&lt;ref name=aristotle/&gt;  Three of the strongest and most famous—that of Achilles and the tortoise, the [[Dichotomy]] argument, and that of an arrow in flight—are presented in detail below.

Zeno's arguments are perhaps the first examples of a method of proof called ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' also known as [[proof by contradiction]].  They are also credited as a source of the [[dialectic]] method used by Socrates.&lt;ref&gt;([fragment 65], Diogenes Laertius. [http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/diogenes/dlzeno-eleatic.htm IX] 25ff and VIII 57).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mathematicians and historians, such as [[Carl Boyer]], hold that Zeno's paradoxes are simply mathematical problems, for which modern [[calculus]] provides a mathematical solution.&lt;ref name=boyer&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyer |first=Carl |title=The History of the Calculus and Its Conceptual Development |url=https://books.google.com/?id=w3xKLt_da2UC&amp;dq=zeno+calculus&amp;q=zeno#v=snippet&amp;q=zeno |year=1959 |publisher=Dover Publications  |accessdate=2010-02-26 |page=295 | quote=If the paradoxes are thus stated in the precise mathematical terminology of continuous variables (...) the seeming contradictions resolve themselves. |isbn=978-0-486-60509-8 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Some [[philosopher]]s, however, say that Zeno's paradoxes and their variations (see [[Thomson's lamp]]) remain relevant [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] problems.&lt;ref name=KBrown/&gt;&lt;ref name=FMoorcroft&gt;{{cite web |first=Francis |last=Moorcroft |title=Zeno's Paradox |url=http://www.philosophers.co.uk/cafe/paradox5.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418141459/http://www.philosophers.co.uk/cafe/paradox5.htm |archivedate=2010-04-18 }}

The origins of the paradoxes are somewhat unclear. [[Diogenes Laertius]], a fourth source for information about Zeno and his teachings, citing [[Favorinus]], says that Zeno's teacher Parmenides was the first to introduce the Achilles and the tortoise paradox. But in a later passage, Laertius attributes the origin of the paradox to Zeno, explaining that Favorinus disagrees.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives'', 9.23 and 9.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paradoxes of motion ==

=== Achilles and the tortoise ===
{{Redirect|Achilles and the Tortoise}}
[[File:Race between Achilles and the tortoise.gif|thumb|Distance vs. time, assuming the tortoise to run at Achilles' half speed]]
[[File:Zeno Achilles Paradox.png|thumb|left|Achilles and the tortoise]]

| In a race, the quickest runner can never overtake the slowest, since the pursuer must first reach the point whence the pursued started, so that the slower must always hold a lead.| as recounted by [[Aristotle]], [[Physics (Aristotle)|''Physics'']] VI:9, 239b15
}}
In the paradox of [[Achilles]] and the [[tortoise]], Achilles is in a footrace with the tortoise. Achilles allows the tortoise a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] of 100 meters, for example. Supposing that each racer starts running at some constant speed (one very fast and one very slow), then after some finite [[time]], Achilles will have run 100 meters, bringing him to the tortoise's starting point. During this time, the tortoise has run a much shorter distance, say, 10 meters. It will then take Achilles some further time to run that distance, by which time the tortoise will have advanced farther; and then more time still to reach this third point, while the tortoise moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles arrives somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has some distance to go before he can even reach the tortoise.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Dichotomy paradox ===
{{ quote

}}

Suppose Homer wishes to walk to the end of a path. Before he can get there, he must get halfway there. Before he can get halfway there, he must get a quarter of the way there. Before traveling a quarter, he must travel one-eighth; before an eighth, one-sixteenth; and so on.

The resulting sequence can be represented as:
:&lt;math&gt; \left\{ \cdots,  \frac{1}{16},  \frac{1}{8},  \frac{1}{4},  \frac{1}{2},  1 \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

This description requires one to complete an infinite number of tasks, which Zeno maintains is an impossibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindberg|first1=David|title=The Beginnings of Western Science|date=2007|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-48205-7|page=33|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sequence also presents a second problem in that it contains no first distance to run, for any possible ([[wikt:finite|finite]]) first distance could be divided in half, and hence would not be first after all. Hence, the trip cannot even begin. The paradoxical conclusion then would be that travel over any finite distance can neither be completed nor begun, and so all motion must be an [[illusion]]. An alternative conclusion, [[Duration (philosophy)#Responses to Kant and Zeno|proposed]] by [[Henri Bergson]], is that motion (time and distance) is not actually divisible.

This argument is called the ''[[Dichotomy]]'' because it involves repeatedly splitting a distance into two parts. It contains some of the same elements as the ''Achilles and the Tortoise'' paradox, but with a more apparent conclusion of motionlessness. It is also known as the '''Race Course''' paradox. Some, like Aristotle, regard the Dichotomy as really just another version of ''Achilles and the Tortoise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Huggett |first=Nick |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#Dic |title=Zeno's Paradoxes: 3.1 The Dichotomy |year=2010 |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arrow paradox ===
[[File:Zeno Arrow Paradox.png|thumb|The arrow]]

{{quote|If everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest, and if that which is in locomotion is always occupying such a space at any moment, the flying arrow is therefore motionless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.6.vi.html#752 |work=The Internet Classics Archive |title=Physics |author=Aristotle |quote=Zeno's reasoning, however, is fallacious, when he says that if everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest, and if that which is in locomotion is always occupying such a space at any moment, the flying arrow is therefore motionless. This is false, for time is not composed of indivisible moments any more than any other magnitude is composed of indivisibles.}}&lt;/ref&gt;|as recounted by [[Aristotle]], [[Physics (Aristotle)|''Physics'']] VI:9, 239b5}}

In the arrow paradox (also known as the '''[[fletching|fletcher's]] paradox'''), Zeno states that for motion to occur, an object must change the position which it occupies. He gives an example of an arrow in flight. He states that in any one (duration-less) instant of time, the arrow is neither moving to where it is, nor to where it is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | chapter-url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lives_of_the_Eminent_Philosophers/Book_IX#Pyrrho | first=Diogenes |last=Laertius |authorlink=Diogenes Laërtius | title=[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]] | volume=IX |chapter=Pyrrho  |at= passage 72 | year=c. 230| isbn=1-116-71900-2  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It cannot move to where it is not, because no time elapses for it to move there; it cannot move to where it is, because it is already there. In other words, at every instant of time there is no motion occurring.  If everything is motionless at every instant, and time is entirely composed of instants, then motion is impossible.

Whereas the first two paradoxes divide space, this paradox starts by dividing time—and not into segments, but into points.&lt;ref name=HuggettArrow&gt;{{cite web |last=Huggett |first=Nick |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#Arr |title=Zeno's Paradoxes: 3.3 The Arrow |year=2010 |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three other paradoxes as given by Aristotle ==

=== Paradox of Place ===
From Aristotle:
{{quote
|If everything that exists has a place, place too will have a place, and so on ''[[ad infinitum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.4.iv.html ''Physics'' IV:1, 209a25]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Paradox of the Grain of Millet ===
Description of the paradox from the ''Routledge Dictionary of Philosophy'':
{{quote
|The argument is that a single grain of [[millet]] makes no sound upon falling, but a thousand grains make a sound. Hence a thousand nothings become something, an absurd conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;The Michael Proudfoot, A.R. Lace. Routledge Dictionary of Philosophy. Routledge 2009, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aristotle's refutation:
{{quote
|Zeno is wrong in saying that there is no part of the millet that does not make a sound: for there is no reason why any such part should not in any length of time fail to move the air that the whole bushel moves in falling. In fact it does not of itself move even such a quantity of the air as it would move if this part were by itself: for no part even exists otherwise than potentially.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.7.vii.html ''Physics'' VII:5, 250a20]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Description from Nick Huggett:
{{quote
|This is a [[Parmenides|Parmenidean]] argument that one cannot trust one's sense of hearing. Aristotle's response seems to be that even inaudible sounds can add to an audible sound.&lt;ref&gt;Huggett, Nick, "Zeno's Paradoxes", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#GraMil&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== The Moving Rows (or Stadium) ===
[[File:Zeno Moving Rows Paradox.png|thumb|The moving rows]]From Aristotle:
{{quote
|... concerning the two rows of bodies, each row being composed of an equal number of bodies of equal size, passing each other on a race-course as they proceed with equal velocity in opposite directions, the one row originally occupying the space between the goal and the middle point of the course and the other that between the middle point and the starting-post. This...involves the conclusion that half a given time is equal to double that time.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.6.vi.html ''Physics'' VI:9, 239b33]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For an expanded account of Zeno's arguments as presented by Aristotle, see [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius']] commentary ''On Aristotle's Physics''.

== Proposed solutions ==

=== Diogenes the Cynic ===
According to [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], [[Diogenes the Cynic]] said nothing upon hearing Zeno's arguments, but stood up and walked, in order to demonstrate the falsity of Zeno's conclusions (see ''[[solvitur ambulando]]''). To fully solve any of the paradoxes, however, one needs to show what is wrong with the argument, not just the conclusions. Through history, several solutions have been proposed, among the earliest recorded being those of Aristotle and Archimedes.

=== Aristotle ===
[[Aristotle]] (384 BC−322 BC) remarked that as the distance decreases, the time needed to cover those distances also decreases, so that the time needed also becomes increasingly small.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. Physics 6.9
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Aristotle's observation that the fractional times also get shorter does not guarantee, in every case, that the task can be completed. One case in which it does not hold is that in which the fractional times decrease in a [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]], while the distances decrease geometrically, such as: 1/2 s for 1/2 m gain, 1/3 s for next 1/4 m gain, 1/4 s for next 1/8 m gain, 1/5 s for next 1/16 m gain, 1/6 s for next 1/32 m gain, etc. In this case, the distances form a convergent series, but the times form a [[divergent series]], the sum of which has no limit. Archimedes developed a more explicitly mathematical approach than Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt;
Aristotle also distinguished "things infinite in respect of divisibility" (such as a unit of space that can be mentally divided into ever smaller units while remaining spatially the same) from things (or distances) that are infinite in extension ("with respect to their extremities").&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. Physics 6.9; 6.2, 233a21-31&lt;/ref&gt;
Aristotle's objection to the arrow paradox was that "Time is not composed of indivisible nows any more than any other magnitude is composed of indivisibles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.6.vi.html |title=Physics |volume=VI |at=Part 9 verse: 239b5 |isbn=0-585-09205-2 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thomas Aquinas ===
[[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;!-- please do not change to Saint Thomas Aquinas, see [[MOS:SAINTS]] --&gt; commenting on Aristotle's objection, wrote "Instants are not parts of time, for time is not made up of instants any more than a magnitude is made of points, as we have already proved. Hence it does not follow that a thing is not in motion in a given time, just because it is not in motion in any instant of that time."&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. Commentary on Aristotle's Physics, Book 6.861
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archimedes ===
Before 212 BC, [[Archimedes]] had developed a method to derive a finite answer for the sum of infinitely many terms that get progressively smaller. (See: [[Geometric series]], [[1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + · · ·]], ''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]''.) Modern calculus achieves the same result, using more rigorous methods (see [[convergent series]], where the "reciprocals of powers of 2" series, equivalent to the Dichotomy Paradox, is listed as convergent). These methods allow the construction of solutions based on the conditions stipulated by Zeno, i.e. the amount of time taken at each step is geometrically decreasing.&lt;ref name=boyer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George B. Thomas, ''Calculus and Analytic Geometry'', Addison Wesley, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bertrand Russell ===
[[Bertrand Russell]] offered what is known as the "at-at theory of motion". It agrees that there can be no motion "during" a durationless instant, and contends that all that is required for motion is that the arrow be at one point at one time, at another point another time, and at appropriate points between those two points for intervening times. In this view motion is a function of position with respect to time.&lt;ref name=HuggettBook&gt;{{ cite book |title=Space From Zeno to Einstein |first=Nick |last=Huggett |year=1999 |isbn=0-262-08271-3 }}

Salmon | page=198 |isbn=978-0-19-510864-4 |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nick Huggett ===
Nick Huggett argues that Zeno is [[begging the question|assuming the conclusion]] when he says that objects that occupy the same space as they do at rest must be at rest.&lt;ref name=HuggettArrow/&gt;

=== Peter Lynds ===
Peter Lynds has argued that all of Zeno's motion paradoxes are resolved by the conclusion that instants in time and instantaneous magnitudes do not physically exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/1197/|title=Zeno's Paradoxes: A Timely Solution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Lynds, Peter. Time and Classical and Quantum Mechanics: Indeterminacy vs. Discontinuity. Foundations of Physics Letter s (Vol. 16, Issue 4, 2003). doi:10.1023/A:1025361725408
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time’s Up Einstein"&gt;
[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.06/physics.html Time’s Up Einstein], Josh McHugh, [[Wired Magazine]], June 2005
&lt;/ref&gt;
Lynds argues that an object in relative motion cannot have an instantaneous or determined relative position (for if it did, it could not be in motion), and so cannot have its motion fractionally dissected as if it does, as is assumed by the paradoxes. For more about the inability to know both speed and location, see [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]].

=== Hermann Weyl ===
Another proposed solution is to question one of the assumptions Zeno used in his paradoxes (particularly the Dichotomy), which is that between any two different points in space (or time), there is always another point. Without this assumption there are only a finite number of distances between two points, hence there is no infinite sequence of movements, and the paradox is resolved. The ideas of [[Planck length]] and [[Planck time]] in modern physics place a limit on the measurement of time and space, if not on time and space themselves. According to [[Hermann Weyl]], the assumption that space is made of finite and discrete units is subject to a further problem, given by the "[[Weyl's tile argument|tile argument]]" or "distance function problem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Bendegem|first=Jean Paul|title=Finitism in Geometry|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/geometry-finitism/#SomParSolProDea|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=2012-01-03|date=17 March 2010 }}

According to this, the length of the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle in discretized space is always equal to the length of one of the two sides, in contradiction to geometry. [[Jean Paul Van Bendegem]] has argued that the Tile Argument can be resolved, and that discretization can therefore remove the paradox.&lt;ref name=boyer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=187807 |title=Discussion:Zeno's Paradoxes and the Tile Argument |first=Jean Paul |last=van Bendegem |location= Belgium |year=1987 |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=295–302|doi=10.1086/289379}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== The paradoxes in modern times ==
Infinite processes remained theoretically troublesome in mathematics until the late 19th century. The [[Ε-δ definition|epsilon-delta]] version of [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]] and [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] developed a rigorous formulation of the logic and calculus involved. These works resolved the mathematics involving infinite processes.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Harold | title=Are Zeno's Paradoxes Based on a Mistake? |jstor=2251675 |year=1965 |journal= [[Mind (journal)|Mind]] |volume=74 |issue=296 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages= 563–570 |doi=10.1093/mind/LXXIV.296.563}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=russell&gt;[[Bertrand Russell|B Russell]] (1956) ''Mathematics and the metaphysicians'' in "The World of Mathematics" (ed.

While mathematics can calculate where and when the moving Achilles will overtake the Tortoise of Zeno's paradox, philosophers such as Brown and Moorcroft&lt;ref name=KBrown&gt;{{cite web

claim that mathematics does not address the central point in Zeno's argument, and that solving the mathematical issues does not solve every issue the paradoxes raise.

Popular literature often misrepresents Zeno's arguments. For example, Zeno is often said to have argued that the sum of an infinite number of terms must itself be infinite–with the result that not only the time, but also the distance to be travelled, become infinite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Benson|first= Donald C.|title= The Moment of Proof : Mathematical Epiphanies|year= 1999|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= New York|isbn= 978-0195117219|page= 14|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8_vbuzxrpfIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A humorous take is offered by [[Tom Stoppard]] in his play Jumpers (1972), in which the principal protagonist, the philosophy professor George Moore, suggests that according to Zeno’s paradox, [[Saint Sebastian]], a 3rd Century Christian saint supposedly martyred by being shot with arrows, died of fright.  However, none of the original ancient sources has Zeno discussing the sum of any infinite series. Simplicius has Zeno saying "it is impossible to traverse an infinite number of things in a finite time". This presents Zeno's problem not with finding the ''sum'', but rather with ''finishing'' a task with an infinite number of steps: how can one ever get from A to B, if an infinite number of (non-instantaneous) events can be identified that need to precede the arrival at B, and one cannot reach even the beginning of a "last event"?&lt;ref name=KBrown/&gt;&lt;ref name=FMoorcroft/&gt;&lt;ref name=Papa-G /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Huggett |first=Nick |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#ZenInf |title=Zeno's Paradoxes: 5. Zeno's Influence on Philosophy |year=2010 |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=2011-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debate continues on the question of whether or not Zeno's paradoxes have been resolved. In ''The History of Mathematics: An Introduction'' (2010) Burton writes, "Although Zeno's argument confounded his contemporaries, a satisfactory explanation incorporates a now-familiar idea, the notion of a 'convergent infinite series.'".&lt;ref&gt;Burton, David, ''A History of Mathematics: An Introduction'', McGraw Hill, 2010, {{isbn|978-0-07-338315-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] offered a "solution" to the paradoxes based on the work of [[Georg Cantor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |date=2002 |title=Our Knowledge of the External World: As a Field for Scientific Method in Philosophy |chapter=Lecture 6. The Problem of Infinity Considered Historically |publisher=Routledge |page=169 |orig-year=First published in 1914 by The Open Court Publishing Company |isbn=0-415-09605-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Brown concludes "Given the history of 'final resolutions', from Aristotle onwards, it's probably foolhardy to think we've reached the end. It may be that Zeno's arguments on motion, because of their simplicity and universality, will always serve as a kind of [[Rorschach test|'Rorschach image']] onto which people can project their most fundamental phenomenological concerns (if they have any)."&lt;ref name=KBrown/&gt;

==A similar ancient Chinese philosophic consideration==
[[History of Science and Technology in China|Ancient Han Chinese]] philosophers from the [[School of Names|Mohist School of Names]] during the [[Warring States period|Warring States period of China (479-221 BCE)]] independently developed equivalents to some of Zeno's paradoxes. The scientist and historian [[Joseph Needham|Sir Joseph Needham]], in his ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'', describes an [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese]] paradox from the surviving [[School of Names|Mohist School of Names]] book of logic which states, in the [[archaism|archaic]] [[Old Chinese|ancient Chinese script]], "a one-foot stick, every day take away half of it, in a myriad ages it will not be exhausted." Several other paradoxes from this philosophical school (more precisely, movement) are known, but their modern interpretation is more speculative.

== Quantum Zeno effect ==
{{Main article|Quantum Zeno effect}}

In 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |bibcode=1977JMP....18..756M |last=Sudarshan |first=E. C. G. |authorlink=E. C. G.

&lt;/ref&gt; physicists [[E. C. George Sudarshan]] and B. Misra discovered that the dynamical evolution (motion) of a quantum system can be hindered (or even inhibited) through observation of the system.&lt;ref name="u0"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.boulder.nist.gov/timefreq/general/pdf/858.pdf |format=PDF |author1=W.M.Itano |author2=D.J.

&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is usually called the "quantum Zeno effect" as it is strongly reminiscent of Zeno's arrow paradox. This effect was first theorized in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |last=Khalfin |first=L.A. |author-link=   |journal=Soviet Phys.

== Zeno behaviour ==
In the field of verification and design of [[timed event system|timed]] and [[hybrid system]]s, the system behaviour is called ''Zeno'' if it includes an infinite number of discrete steps in a finite amount of time.&lt;ref name="Fishwick2007"&gt;{{cite book | editor=Paul A.  Fishwick | title=Handbook of dynamic system modeling | url=https://books.google.com/?id=cM-eFv1m3BoC&amp;pg=SA15-PA22 | accessdate=2010-03-05 | edition=hardcover | series=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC Computer and Information Science | date=1 June 2007 | publisher=CRC Press | location=Boca Raton, Florida, USA | isbn=978-1-58488-565-8 | pages=15–22 to 15–23 | chapter=15.6 "Pathological Behavior Classes" in chapter 15  "Hybrid Dynamic Systems: Modeling and Execution" by Pieter J.  Mosterman, The Mathworks, Inc. }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[formal verification]] techniques exclude these behaviours from analysis, if they are not equivalent to non-Zeno behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lamport |first=Leslie |authorlink=Leslie Lamport |year=2002 |title=Specifying Systems |format=PDF |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-321-14306-X |url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/book-02-08-08.pdf |page=128 |accessdate=2010-03-06 }}

In [[systems design]] these behaviours will also often be excluded from system models, since they cannot be implemented with a digital controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Henzinger |first2=Thomas |last1=Franck |first1=Cassez |first3=Jean-Francois |last3=Raskin |url=http://mtc.epfl.ch/~tah/Publications/a_comparison_of_control_problems_for_timed_and_hybrid_systems.html |title=A Comparison of Control Problems for Timed and Hybrid Systems |year=2002 |accessdate=2010-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528193234/http://mtc.epfl.ch/~tah/Publications/a_comparison_of_control_problems_for_timed_and_hybrid_systems.html |archivedate=May 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Zvi Galil was born in [[Tel Aviv]] in 1947. He completed both his B.Sc. (1970) and his M.Sc. (1971) in [[Applied Mathematics]] at [[Tel Aviv University]] before earning his Ph.D. in Computer Science at [[Cornell]] in 1975 under the supervision of [[John Hopcroft]].&lt;ref name="mathgenealogy"&gt;{{mathgenealogy|name=Zvi Galil|id=67227}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then spent a year working as a post-doctorate researcher at [[IBM]]'s [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]] in [[Yorktown Heights, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On converting on-line algorithms into real-time and on real-time algorithms for string-matching and palindrome recognition|journal=ACM SIGACT News|volume=7|issue=4|doi=10.1145/990502.990505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic administrator==
From 1976 until 1995 he worked in the computer science department of Tel Aviv University, serving as its chair from 1979 to 1982. In 1982 he joined the faculty of [[Columbia University]], serving as the chair of the Computer Science Department from 1989-1994.&lt;ref name="festschrift"/&gt; From 1995-2007, he served as the dean of the Fu Foundation School of Engineering &amp; Applied Science. In this position he oversaw the renaming of the school in honor of Chinese businessman Z. Y. Fu after a large donation was given in his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E2D9113AF932A35753C1A961958260|title= Chinese Tycoon Gives Columbia $26 Million|date=1997-10-01|publisher=[[New York Times]]|first=Karen W.|last=Arenson|accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Columbia, he was appointed the Julian Clarence Levi Professor of Mathematical Methods and Computer Science in 1987, and the Morris and Alma A. Schapiro Dean of Engineering in 1995.&lt;ref name="festschrift"/&gt;

From 1983 to 1987, Galil served as the chairman of [[ACM SIGACT]], an organization that promotes research in [[theoretical computer science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=ACM SIGACT News|volume=19|issue=1|date=Fall 1987|title=Front matter|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=38309}}&lt;/ref&gt;
