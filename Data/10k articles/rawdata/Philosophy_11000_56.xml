==Family background==
Badayuni was born in [[Delhi]], [[India]] on November 11, 1898. His father, Hakim Abdul Qayyum, died 20 days after he was born. His grandfather, Abdul Majid Qadri, was a Shaikh of [[Qadri]] Sufi Order. He received his religious education from his uncle Abdul Qadir, and studied Islamic Medicine in Delhi with [[Hakim Ajmal Khan]]. The scholars of Badayun were active in dissemination of their Aqidah in refutation of sects which they considered heretical.

==Education==
Badayuni studied Islamic Sciences at Madrasa Qadiriya and Madrasa Ilahiya, Kanpur. 
==Leader of community==
In the [[Khilafat Movement]], he was a member of the Central Khilafat Committee of [[Bombay]]. He took a stand against the [[Shuddhi]] movement, which was initiated by [[Hindu]] Arya Samajis to reconvert Indian Muslims to [[Hinduism]]. Abdul Hamid left the [[Indian National Congress]] and joined ''Markazi Tableeg al-Islam'' to oppose the Shuddhi Movement and actively worked to prevent the reversion of Muslims to Hinduism with [[Maulana Naeem-ud-Deen Muradabadi|Naeem-ud-Deen Muradabadi]], Abdul Hafiz Qadri, Syed [[Peer Jamaat Ali Shah]] and Syed Abu al-Hasanat Qadri.

== Association with [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] ==
He was a member of the All India Muslim League Council beginning in 1937. He neutralized the influence of Pro-Congress [[Deobandi]] Scholar Hussain Ahmad Madni in Silhat and Bengal in favor of the Muslim League. The resolution for the creation of Pakistan was adopted on March 23, 1940. He spoke in favor of the resolution at Minto Park, Lahore. At the [[All India Sunni Conference]] held at Banaras in 1946 and [[Peer Jamaat Ali Shah]] declared [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] a Muslim and Maulana Abdul Hamid supported Syed Jamaat Ali Shah and spoke for more than 3 hours in support of Quid-e-Azam &amp; the Muslim League.&lt;ref&gt;Mujahid e Millat Maulana Abdul Hamid Badayuni RA ke Milli wa Siasi Khidmat, Zahooruddin Khan Amritsri published by Idara-e-Pakistan Shanasi lahore  [http://www.slideshare.net/themrtariq/tehreek-e-pakistan-aur-allama-abdul-hamid-badayuni]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pakpost.gov.pk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakpost.gov.pk/philately/stamps99/pioneer_of_freedom.html|title=Pioneer of Freedom (Series)|publisher=pakpost.gov.pk|accessdate=2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Badayuni went to Hijaz in 1946 under the leadership of [[Muhammad Abdul Aleem Siddiqi]] to request that the Saudi Government end the Hajj Tax and also to explain the mission of the Muslim League to create an independent Pakistan. He visited Haramain Sharifain 22 times and met many Muslim Leaders. He was a founding member of the [[Council of Islamic Ideology]] and also held the post of President of [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan]] which was a prominent body of the Sunni [[Barelvi]] movement in Pakistan.

'''Ali Shariati Mazinani''' ({{lang-fa|علی شریعتی مزینانی}}, {{nbsp}}23 November 1933 – 21 June 1975) was an [[Iran]]ian revolutionary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qantara.de/webcom/show_article.php/_c-476/_nr-1103/i.html|title=30th Anniversary of the Foundation of the Islamic Republic|publisher=Qantara|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sociologist who focused on the [[sociology of religion]]. He is held as one of the most influential Iranian intellectuals of the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;Gheissari, Ali. 1998. ''Iranian Intellectuals in the Twentieth Century''. Austin: University of Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been called the "ideologue of the [[Iranian Revolution]]", although his ideas ended up not forming the basis of the Islamic Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, Ervand. 1993. "Ali Shariati: Ideologue of the Iranian Revolution". In Edmund Burke and Ira Lapidus (eds.), ''Islam, Politics, and Social Movements''. Los Angeles: University of California Press. First published in MERIP Reports (January 1982): 25–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ali Shariati (Ali Masharati) was born in 1933 in [[Kahak, Razavi Khorasan|Kahak]] (a village in Mazinan), a suburb of [[Sabzevar]], in northeastern [[Imperial State of Persia|Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ali Rahnema|Rahnema, Ali]]. 1998, 2000. ''An Islamic Utopian. A Political Biography of Ali Shari'ati''. London: I.B. Tauris, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; His father's family were clerics.&lt;ref name=rakel8&gt;{{cite book|last=Rakel|first=E.P.|title=The Iranian Political Elite, State and Society Relations, and Foreign Relations since the Islamic Revolution|year=2008|publisher=University of Amsterdam|url=http://dare.uva.nl/document/104471}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Mohammad-Taqi, was a teacher and Islamic scholar. In 1947, he opened the Centre for the Propagation of Islamic Truths in [[Mashhad]], in [[Khorasan Province]].&lt;ref&gt;''An Islamic Utopian'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a social Islamic forum which became embroiled in the oil nationalisation movement of the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;''An Islamic Utopian'', pp. 13–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Shariati's mother was from a small land-owning family.&lt;ref name=rakel8/&gt; His mother was from Sabzevar, a little town near Mashhad.&lt;ref name="Ervand Abrahamian 1989 105"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nCVsR1cJc7oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Iranian+Mojahedin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidqayclsXRAhUxSJoKHTSiBiwQ6AEIGTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%20shariati&amp;f=false|title=Radical Islam: The Iranian Mojahedin|author=Ervand Abrahamian|year=1989|page=105|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=1850430772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his years at the Teacher's Training College in Mashhad, Shariati came into contact with young people who were from less privileged economic classes of society, and for the first time saw the poverty and hardship that existed in Iran during that period. At the same time, he was exposed to many aspects of [[Western philosophy|Western philosophical]] and political thought. He attempted to explain and offer solutions for the problems faced by Muslim societies through traditional Islamic principles interwoven with, and understood from, the point of view of modern sociology and philosophy. His articles from this period for the Mashhad daily newspaper, ''Khorasan'', display his developing eclecticism and acquaintance with the ideas of modernist thinkers such as [[Jamal-al-Din Afghani|Jamal al-Din al-Afghani]], [[Sir Allama Muhammad Iqbal]] of Pakistan, among Muslims, and [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Alexis Carrel]].&lt;ref&gt;''An Islamic Utopian'', pp. 61–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, he became a high-school teacher and founded the Islamic Students' Association, which led to his arrest following a demonstration. In 1953, the year of [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|Mossadeq's overthrow]], he became a member of the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]]. He received his bachelor's degree from the [[University of Mashhad]] in 1955. In 1957, he was arrested again by the Iranian police, along with sixteen other members of the National Resistance Movement.

Shariati then managed to get a scholarship for France, where he continued his graduate studies at [[University of Paris| the Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]]. He left Paris after earning a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in sociology in 1964 from the Sorbonne. During this period in Paris, Shariati started collaborating with the [[Algerian National Liberation Front]] (FLN) in 1959. The following year, he began to read [[Frantz Fanon]] and translated an anthology of his work into Persian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexpress.fr/info/monde/dossier/islamisme/dossier.asp?ida=436714 «La jeune génération est un enjeu»] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205192933/http://www.lexpress.fr/info/monde/dossier/islamisme/dossier.asp?ida=436714 |date=5 December 2006 }}, interview with [[Gilles Kepel]] in ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'', 26 January 2006 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shariati introduced Fanon's thought into Iranian revolutionary émigrée circles. He was arrested in Paris on 17 January 1961 during a demonstration in honour of [[Patrice Lumumba]].

The same year he joined [[Ebrahim Yazdi]], [[Mostafa Chamran]] and [[Sadegh Qotbzadeh]] in founding the [[Freedom Movement of Iran]] abroad. In 1962, he continued studying sociology and [[history of religion]]s, and followed the courses of Islamic scholar [[Louis Massignon]], [[Jacques Berque]] and the sociologist [[Georges Gurvitch]]. He also came to know the philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] that same year, and published [[Jalal Al-e Ahmad]]'s book ''[[Gharbzadegi]]'' (or ''Occidentosis'') in Iran.

Shariati then returned to Iran in 1964 where he was arrested and imprisoned for engaging in subversive political activities while in France. He was released after a few weeks, at which point he began teaching at the University of Mashhad.

Shariati then went to [[Tehran]] where he began lecturing at the [[Hosseiniye Ershad]] Institute. These lectures were hugely popular among his students and were spread by word of mouth throughout all economic sectors of society, including the middle and upper classes, where interest in his teachings began to grow immensely.

His continued success again aroused the interest of the government, which arrested him as well as many of his students. Widespread pressure from the people, and an international outcry, eventually led to his release on 20 March 1975, after eighteen months in solitary confinement.

Shariati was allowed to leave for England. He died three weeks later in a [[Southampton]] hospital under "mysterious circumstances" although in [[Ali Rahnema]]'s biography of Shariati, he is said to have died of a fatal heart attack. He is buried next to [[Zaynab bint Ali|Sayyidah Zaynab]], the granddaughter of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], and the daughter of [[Ali]], in Damascus, Syria, where Iranian pilgrims often visit.

Shariati sought to revive the revolutionary currents of [[Shia Islam|Shiism]].&lt;ref name=ostovar&gt;{{cite web|last=Ostovar|first=Afshon P.|title=Guardians of the Islamic Revolution Ideology, Politics, and the Development of Military Power in Iran (1979–2009)|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/64683/afshon_1.pdf;jsessionid=DF7BFA33BF18FF73E9117CB0504F14E1?sequence=1|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=26 July 2013|format=PhD Thesis|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His interpretation of Shiism encouraged revolution in the world, and promised salvation after death.&lt;ref name=milani&gt;{{cite book|author=Abbas Milani|title=The Myth of the Great Satan: A New Look at America's Relations with Iran|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTrRom48fhAC&amp;pg=PA123|accessdate=1 August 2013|date=31 July 2010|publisher=Hoover Press|isbn=978-0-8179-1136-2|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shariati referred to his brand of Shiism as [[Red Shi'ism vs. Black Shi'ism|"red Shiism"]] which he contrasted with non-revolutionary [[Red Shi'ism vs. Black Shi'ism|"black Shiism"]] or [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|Safavid Shiism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ali Shariati, "[[Red Shi'ism vs. Black Shi'ism]]".&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas have been compared to the Catholic [[Liberation Theology]] movement founded in South America by Peruvian [[Gustavo Gutierrez]] and Brazilian [[Leonardo Boff]].&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Shariati was a prominent Islamist philosopher who argued that a good society would conform to Islamic values. He suggested that the role of government was to guide society in the best possible manner rather than manage it in the best possible way.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evSkdzXF_4&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the most learned members of the [[Ulema]] (clergy) should play a leadership role in guiding society because they best understand how to administer an Islamic value system based on the teachings of the Prophets of God and the 12 Shia [[Twelver]] Imams.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RjiWLcuyQA&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the role of the clergy was to guide society in accordance with Islamic values to advance human beings towards reaching their highest potential—not to provide/serve the hedonistic desires of individuals as in the West.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

Shariati's works were highly influenced by the [[Third Worldism]] that he encountered as a student in Paris—ideas that [[class conflict|class war]] and revolution would bring about a just and [[classless society]]—from one side, and the epistemic [[decolonisation]] thinking of his time from the other side. He is said to have adopted the idea of ''[[Gharbzadegi]]'' from [[Jalal Al-e Ahmad]] and given it "its most vibrant and influential second life".&lt;ref&gt;Mottahedeh, Roy, ''The Mantle of the Prophet: Religion and Politics in Iran'', p. 330&lt;/ref&gt;

He sought to translate these ideas into cultural symbols of Shiism that Iranians could relate to. Shariati believed Shia should not merely await the return of the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|12th Imam]], but should actively work to hasten his return by fighting for [[social justice]], "even to the point of embracing [[martyrdom]]," saying "everyday is [[Ashoura]], every place is [[Battle of Karbala|Karbala]]".&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), pp. 128–9&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was writing the three letters to Fanon, unlike him, Shariati believed that it is not true that we have to put away religion to fight imperialism. He felt that people could fight imperialism solely by recovering their culture identity. In some countries such an identity was intertwined with fundamental religious beliefs. Shariati refers to the maxim of returning to ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= From Blank Revolution to Islamic Revolution|author=Naser Gharagozlu|page=87|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shariati and socialism===
It seems that his eagerness to socialism begun with the translation of the book ''[[Abu Dhar al-Ghifari|Abu Zarr]]: The God-Worshipping Socialist'' by an Egyptian thinker namely Abdul Hamid Jowdat-al-Sahar ([[:ar:عبد الحميد جودة السحار]]). According to this book, Abu Zarr was the very first socialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qh_QotrY7RkC&amp;pg=PA465&amp;lpg=PA465&amp;dq=Abu+Zarr:+the+socialist+God+worshiper&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3FJRj7pDvW&amp;sig=N7x5y1j-dd8U7RfADglLRUWV5c0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG1-ie44vUAhUl34MKHa2pCFIQ6AEIOzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Abu%20Zarr%3A%20the%20socialist%20God%20worshiper&amp;f=false |title=Iran Between Two Revolutions |last=Abrahamian |first=Ervand |website=books.google.ca |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=465 |access-date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, Shariarti's father declared that his son believed that the principles of Abu Zarr are fundamental. Even some thinkers described Shariati as the Abu Zarr of Modern Time in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nCVsR1cJc7oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Iranian+Mojahedin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidqayclsXRAhUxSJoKHTSiBiwQ6AEIGTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%20shariati&amp;f=false|title=Radical Islam: The Iranian Mojahedin|author=Ervand Abrahamian|year=1989|page=106|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=1850430772}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all his thoughts, there is his insistence on the necessity of revolutionary action. Shariati believed that Marxism could not provide the [[Third World]] with the ideological means for its own liberation. One of his premises was that Islam by nature is a revolutionary ideology. Therefore, Islam could relate to the modern world as an ideology. According to Shariati, the historical and original origin of human problems was the emergence of private ownership. He believed that in the modern era, the appearance of the machine was the second most fundamental change in the human condition. In fact, private ownership and the emergence of the machine, if considered one of two curves of history, belong to the second period of history. The first period is collective ownership. However, Shariati gave a critique about the historical development of religion and the modern philosophical and ideological movements and their relationship to both private ownership and the emergence of the machine.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvnb|Manouchehri, Abbas|Ali Shariati and The Islamic Renaissance|Phd dissertation|year=1988|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Epistemology====

Shariati developed the idea of the social, cultural and historical contingencies of religious knowledge in sociology. He believed in the earthly religion and in the social context in which the meaning of society is construed. He also emphasized that he understood religion historically because he was a sociologist. He said he was concerned with the historical and social [[Tawhid]] not with the truth of the exalted book of [[Quran]] or Muhammad or Ali.&lt;ref&gt;Behrooz Ghamari-Tabrizi, Abdolkarim Soroush, The Oxford Handbook of Islam and Politics, Edited by John L. Esposito and Emad El-Din Shahin, online pub date: Dec 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy of history==
Completely contrary to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and his philosophy of history, Shariati believed that it is not true that the civilized human is less consciousness than modern people  {{clarify|date=April 2017}} but rather there is a difference between them. The civilized man could talk on himself more that universe and the new people are so concerned with reality and universe that there is no place for himself and mysticism and religion. Of course he knows the movement of soul in Hegel’s philosophy and history in one sense as right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite article|url=http://www.noormags.ir/view/fa/articlepage/16475/%d8%b4%d8%b1%db%8c%d8%b9%d8%aa%db%8c-%d9%88-%d9%81%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%81%d9%87-%d8%aa%d8%a7%d8%b1%db%8c%d8%ae-%d9%87%da%af%d9%84?q=%D9%87%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%B7%20%D8%B4%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B9%D8%AA%DB%8C&amp;score=120.44966&amp;rownumber=1|author=Ahmad Rasekhi|title=Shariati and the hegel's philosophy of history|page=41|year=1198|magazine=Keyhan Farhangi|number=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=May 2017}}

==Political philosophy==
In the first place Shariati criticised western [[liberal democracy]]. He pointed out that there is a direct relationship between [[democracy]], [[liberalism]] and the plundering of nations. He believed that liberal democracy is the enemy of humankind. He also referred to the fact that the ruling economic system of liberal democracy is unjust and contrary to the rights of people. He maintained that in such a society, someone who is weak is already subjected to defeat and annihilation. There are basic foundations in Shariati’s thoughts and his criticism of liberal democracy. The first foundation is related to the contrast between the religious worldview and the non-religious one. He explained history, society and humanity according to a [[monism|monistic]] worldview. He explained liberalism as something with inequality and discrimination. Freedom and equality based on spirituality were the very basis of pre-modern societies which were devastated in one period of history. 

Shariati believed that the government of Imam Ali could be considered the best form of democracy. On this occasion, he tried to interpret the behavior of [[Ali|Imam Ali]] in contrast with his enemy.&lt;ref name="Sayyed Javad Imam Jomeh Zadeh, Hosein Rouhani 2007 59–78"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.noormags.ir/view/fa/articlepage/299696/%d8%a8%d8%b1%d8%b1%d8%b3%db%8c-%d8%aa%d8%b7%d8%a8%db%8c%d9%82%db%8c-%d8%af%d9%85%d9%88%da%a9%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%b3%db%8c-%d8%ba%d8%b1%d8%a8%db%8c-%d8%a8%d8%a7-%d8%af%d9%85%d9%88%da%a9%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%b3%db%8c-%d9%85%d8%aa%d8%b9%d9%87%d8%af-%d8%af%da%a9%d8%aa%d8%b1-%d8%b9%d9%84%db%8c-%d8%b4%d8%b1%db%8c%d8%b9%d8%aa%db%8c?q=%D8%B9%D9%84%DB%8C%20%D8%B4%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B9%D8%AA%DB%8C&amp;score=449.0383&amp;rownumber=1|author=Sayyed Javad Imam Jomeh Zadeh, Hosein Rouhani|title=comparative inquiry on western democracy and commitment democracy of Ali Sharity|magazine=Social sciences of Mashhad university|year=2007|pages=59–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarification needed|date=May 2017}} He called this democracy Commitment democracy. It appears that Shariati did not accept the western definition of [[democracy]] although he had no problem with democracy. According to him, a religious government is the democratic right of [[Muslim]] citizens. He believed that one of the basic problems of western democracy is [[demagogue|demagogy]]. Nowadays the votes of voters direct to special channels with the help of advertising instruments. In such a condition only one who is critically conscious can dispose of distractions and surface-level arguments, and vote effectively for themselves and their communities. He maintains that the western democracy based on gold, cruelty and tricking (Zar, Zour va Tazvir) is an anti-revolutionary regime which is different with ideological Guidance.&lt;ref name="Sayyed Javad Imam Jomeh Zadeh, Hosein Rouhani 2007 59–78"/&gt;{{clarification needed|date=May 2017}}{{clarification needed|date=May 2017}}

===Commitment democracy===

For explaining better the commitment democracy, he at first divides between two concepts. One of them is Syasat and the other is politic. Syasat is a philosophy by government that want to have the responsibility of changing and becoming the society not its being and existence. In fact Syasat is a progressive and dynamic thing. The aim of government in the philosophy of Syasat is to change social foundations, institutions and even all the norms of society namely culture, morality and desires etc. in simple word, Syasat want to make exist the people. In contrary, there is no making in politic. In other word politic is follow of having people not making them. Of course Shariati prefers Syasat on politic because the former is more progressive. He considers with making human(Ensan Sazi). In fact his [[utopia]] is constructed with three concepts of Gnosis, [[Equality before the law|equality]] and [[Political freedom|freedom]]. Commitment democracy appeared out of his lecture in Hoseyniyeh Ershad; a famous lecture with the name of [[Ummah and Imamate]]. According to him, Imam is one who want to guide humans not only in political, social and economic dimensions but also in all existential dimensions. He believes that Imam is alive everywhere and every time. In one hand Imamate is not a metaphysical belief but a revolutionary guide philosophy. He added that Imam has to guide people not according to his desire like dictator but to Islamic ideology and authentic values.&lt;ref name="Sayyed Javad Imam Jomeh Zadeh, Hosein Rouhani 2007 59–78"/&gt;{{clarification needed|date=May 2017}}

==Sociology==
Some scholars known him among the current of religious neo-thinkers. According to this stand point, Shariati accepted the rationality of west. Shariati known the theoretical foundation of west as [[civilization]] and called its appearances as Tajadod. He emphasized on accepting of [[civilization]] and criticized tajadod. He also believed that the civilization has to be considered as something deep. He also known very well of the importance of [[Science|empirical science]] and knowledge. The empirical methodology appreciated by him. He also criticized traditionalism for regardless of scientific methodology. In other hand, he criticized Modernists because of confusing the western ideological theories with valid scientific epistemology. According to him, the knowledge of reason is self-evident. Therefore, he suggested to thought of reason as the axiom for understanding the other sources namely holy book or [[Quran]], tradition, syrah and consensus. Also he denied consensus as a source for understang [[religion]]. He insisted on the concepts of knowledge and Time along with holy book and tradition. Consequently, he had emphasized on the important role of methodology and changing of viewpoint. Also Shariati, who was the fan of [[Georges Gurvitch]] in analysis of [[sociology]], believes that there is no special pattern for analysis of social affairs and historical events. He thought that there is no unity of religion and society, but rather there are many religions and societies. Also shariati referred to active role of scholar of human science during investigation and scientific research. He believes that There is a relation between values of scholar and affecting of those values on the conclusions of investigation. He believes that we haven’t to extend the other conclusions of other western scholars to our society. However he given to criticize the western ideological schools such as nationalism, liberalism and Marxism and etc. He maintains that there is no conformity and correspondence between western ideology and Iranian society. According to him, the democracy is inconsistent with revolutionary evolution and progress. One of his criticism to western ideology is to regardless imitation of those ideology. One of the other his criticism is to denying spirituality in the western ideology. In fact, those ideologies try to stop humans from arriving at transcendental goals and any evolutionary movements.  In this occasion, he firmly criticized capitalism and at the same time, In contrary, he admired socialism because of guiding human to evolution and freeing from utilitarianism. He firmly criticized Karl Marx. According to Shariati, Because Karl Marx knows the economy as the beneath and foundation of human and society he has gone strayed. Just in contrary, sharia knows human as the foundation and origin of society not [[economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fardin Qoreishi|url=http://www.noormags.ir/view/fa/articlepage/70654/%d8%b9%d9%84%db%8c-%d8%b4%d8%b1%db%8c%d8%b9%d8%aa%db%8c-%d9%88-%d8%ba%d8%b1%d8%a8-%d8%a7%d9%86%d8%af%db%8c%d8%b4%db%8c-%d8%a7%d8%b2-%d9%85%d9%88%d8%b6%d8%b9-%d9%86%d9%88%da%af%d8%b1%d8%a7%db%8c%db%8c-%d8%af%db%8c%d9%86%db%8c?q=%D8%B9%D9%84%DB%8C%20%D8%B4%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B9%D8%AA%DB%8C&amp;score=431.22278&amp;rownumber=2|title=Shariati and thinking on west from religious neo reflection|pages=178–179|year=2001|magazine=Nameh Pajouhesh}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarification needed|date=May 2017}}

==Modern problems==
According to Shariati, human [[history]] is composed of two stages, the stage of collectivity and the stage of [[Private property|private ownership]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He explained that the first stage, collectivity, was concerned with social equality and spiritual oneness. But the second stage, which is the current era, could be considered as the domination of the many by one. The second stage began with the emergence of [[Private property|private ownership]]. The various types of private ownership in history have included [[slavery]], [[serfdom]], [[feudalism]], and [[capitalism]] among others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; According to the concept of [[social ownership]], all material and spiritual resources are accessible to everyone. But monopoly polarised the human community. In fact, according to Shariati, private ownership is the main cause of all modern problems. These problems change men’s brotherhood and love to duplicity, deceit, hatred, exploitation, [[Colonization|colonisation]] and [[massacre]]. The polarisation by [[monopoly]] manifested itself in different forms throughout history. For example, in ancient times there were slave economies which transferred to capitalist society in modern times. In other words, machinism, or the dependence on machines, can be considered the latest stage of private ownership. Machinism began in the nineteenth century and human beings have had to confront the many anxieties and problems arousing from it.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Legacy==
There are many adherents and opponents of Shariati’s views. But we have to pay attention to the point that the image of Shariati is not such that some revolutionary groups, in early days of Islamic republic of Iran, attributed to him. In fact, Shariati has an unknown figure and personality.{{clarification needed|date=May 2017}} [[Ali Khamenei]] knew Shariati as a pioneer of Islamic teaching according to the requirements of his generation. According to Sayyed Ali Khamenei, Shariati had also both positive and negative characteristics. Khamenei believes that it is unfair that we consider Shariati as someone who firmly disagreed with the Mullahs. One of the positive sides of Shariati was his ability to explain his thought progression with suitable and simple language for his generation. Shariati not only was not the opposition of Mullahs but rather he believes in the currents of Mullahs in [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8903290362&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarification needed|date=May 2017}}  Some Scholars like Elizabeth F. Thompson try to envisage some similarities between Shariati and his role in the Islamic revolution in Iran with Sayyed Qutb’s role in Egypt. One similarity is that both of them paved the way for the imminent revolution in Iran and Egypt. Both desired of Islamic cultural dominance. Both were fans of being revolutionary about ruling values and norms. They considered [[Islamism]] a third way between those of America and the Soviet Union. At the same time they were not wholly utopian and they were partly Islamic. {{clarification needed|date=May 2017}} Of course there are differences between them - Shariati was a leftist while Qutb was a conservative. According to [[Mahmoud Taleghani]], Ali Shariati was a thinker who created a school for revolution. The school guided young people to revolutionary action. Beheshti believes that Shariati’s work was fundamental to Islamic revolution.&lt;ref name="Ervand Abrahamian 1989 105"/&gt;

According to Hamid Enayat, Shariati was not only a theorist but also an adherent of Islamic radicalism. Enayat believes that Shariati can be considered the founder of Islamic socialism. Enayat considers him to be one of the most beloved and popular individuals in Islamic radicalism and socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hamid Enayat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TauRPwAACAAJ&amp;dq=hamid+enayat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiogo3hpoLSAhXGIJoKHV7xCo8Q6AEIJjAC|title=Modern Islamic Political Thought|year=2008|publisher=Acls History E Book Project|isbn=1597404608}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarification needed|date=May 2017}} 

According to Hamid Elgar, Shariati was the number one ideologue of the Islamic revolution.&lt;ref name="Abdollah Vakili 1991 30–37"&gt;{{cite book|author=Abdollah Vakili|title=Ali shariati and the mystical tradition of islam|publisher=Institute of Islamic studies, Mc Gill University|year=1991|pages=30–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Despite passing away at the young age of 43, he was the prolific author of "more than a hundred books"&lt;ref&gt;[[Mohamed Hassanein Heikal]], ''Iran, the untold story: an insider's account of America's Iranian adventure and its consequences for the future'', Pantheon Books (1982), p. 129 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Scott, ''Pieces of the Game: The Human Drama of Americans Held Hostage in Iran'', Peachtree Publ (1984), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;, and the number of his publications goes up to some 200 if we include "articles, seminar papers, and lecture series",&lt;ref&gt;Najibullah Lafraie, ''Revolutionary Ideology and Islamic Militancy: The Iranian Revolution and Interpretations of the Quran'', I.B.Tauris (2009), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; some of the most notable being:

'''Analytic theology''' (abbreviated as AT) refers to a growing body of theological literature resulting from the application of the methods and concepts of late twentieth-century analytic philosophy to theological writing and thought. In the last decade, various lectures, study centers, conference sections, academic journals and at least one monograph series have appeared with “Analytic Theology” in their title or description. The movement counts both philosophers and theologians in its ranks, but as the head-noun theology in the title indicates, a growing number of theologians with philosophical training are producing AT literature. Analytic theology is strongly related to the [[philosophy of religion]] but is wider in scope due to its willingness to engage topics not normally addressed in the philosophy of religion such as the [[Eucharist]], [[sin]], salvation, and [[eschatology]]. Given the types of historical philosophy that have funded analytic [[philosophy of religion]], analytic theologians are frequently involved in retrieval theology as they revisit, re-appropriate, and modify older Christian solutions to theological and theological questions. Analytic theology has strong roots in Anglo-American analytic philosophy of religion in the last quarter of the 20th century as well as similarities, at times, to scholastic approaches to theology. However, the title analytic theology primarily refers to a resurgence of philosophical-theological work during the last 15 years by a community of scholars spreading outward from centers in the UK and US.

==Defining analytic theology==
Historically and methodologically, AT is both a way of approaching theological works as well as a sociological or historical shift in academic theology.

===Analytic theology defined as a theological method===

Due to its similarities to [[philosophical theology]] and [[philosophy of religion]], offering a definition for analytic theology has been a challenge. Attempts at definitions have been given by individuals such as systematic theologian [[William J. Abraham]], who defines analytic theology as “systematic theology attuned to the deployment of the skills, resources, and virtues of analytic philosophy. It is the articulation of the central themes of Christian teaching illuminated by the best insights of analytic philosophy.”&lt;ref&gt;William J. Abraham, “Systematic Theology as Analytic Theology,” in ''Analytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology'', ed. Oliver Crisp and Michael C. Rea (Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosopher [[Michael Rea]] defines analytic theology as “the activity of approaching theological topics with the ambitions of an analytic philosopher and in a style that conforms to the prescriptions that are distinctive of analytic philosophical discourse. It will also involve, more or less, pursuing those topics in a way that engages the literature that is constitutive of the analytic, employing some of the technical jargon from that tradition, and so on. But, in the end, it is the style and the ambitions that are most central.”&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Rea, “Introduction,” in ''Analytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology'', ed. Oliver Crisp and Michael C. Rea (Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge theologian [[Sarah Coakley]], by contrast, warns that attempts to set down an essentialist definition for analytic theology (i.e. a club that some are in and some are not welcome in) will distract from the productive work resulting from the recent flourishing of AT.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Coakley, “On Why Analytic Theology Is Not a Club,” ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'' 81, no. 3 (September 1, 2013): 604-605.&lt;/ref&gt;
       
More specifically, analytic theology can be understood in a narrow and wide sense. When understood more widely, analytic theology is a method to be applied in theological works. Like other methodological approaches to theology (e.g. [[historical theology]], retrieval theology, [[post-liberal theology]]), analytic theology, on this view, is a way of doing theological work that is independent of one’s theological commitments. In this wider sense, Muslims, Jews, and Christians could all apply the same analytic methods to their own theological work and thus be doing analytic theology. William Wood has called this the “formal model” of analytic theology.&lt;ref&gt;William Wood, “Trajectories, Traditions, and Tools in Analytic Theology,” ''Journal of Analytic Theology'' 4 (2016): 255&lt;/ref&gt;
       
By contrast, some are concerned that those participating in the analytic theology movement are doing more than just applying a particular method to their work. Given that most of its practitioners are still Christians, they wonder if analytic theology is also a theological program (i.e. it is committed to forwarding a certain body of theological beliefs). This then would be the narrower sense of analytic theology. In contrast to the formal method above, Wood suggests we could call this wider sense the “substantive model” of analytic theology. Here one does “theology that draws on the tools and methods of [[analytic philosophy]] to advance a specific theological agenda, one that is, broadly speaking, associated with traditional Christian orthodoxy. On this conception, the central task of analytic theology would be to develop philosophically well-grounded accounts of traditional Christian doctrines like the Trinity, Christology, and the atonement.” Wood is correct that the majority of analytic theologians are Christians who write in support of a broadly conciliar Orthodoxy.  However, until statements by Christian analytic theologians can be cited that reject non-Christian (or even unorthodox Christian) conclusions as falling outside the boundaries of analytic theology, the “substantive model” may lack justification as a fair definition.
       
Falling between these two poles may be a more moderate position. [[Oliver Crisp]], one of the founders of the contemporary AT movement, comments that AT is indeed more than just a theological style of writing. It also involves work by theologians who hold that “there is some theological truth of the matter and that this truth of the matter can be ascertained and understood by human beings (theologians included!).” Such writers also hold to “an instrumental use of reason.”&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Crisp, “On Analytic Theology,” in ''Analytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology'', ed. Oliver Crisp and Michael C. Rea (Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Crisp’s comment brings out a key attribute of analytic theology addressed below - a tendency towards theological realism.
        
Whether one holds a wide, narrow or moderate view of analytic theology, “doing” analytic theology does not require undergoing a religious experience, participating in a church, or holding to any confessional statement. This openness makes more sense in contrast to the idea of doctrine, which involves the clarification and advancement of the teachings of a particular church or Christian community. 
       
====Characteristics of analytic theology====
As a way of doing theology, analytic theology can often be identified by at least two, but usually three features:  First there is the analytic method itself.  Second is the focus on theological topics, such as incarnation or resurrection. There is not a hard boundary between analytic theology and analytic philosophy of religion. However, as noted in the introduction, analytic theology tends to treat a wider range of theological topics than does philosophy of religion. Whereas the latter might limit its focus to the existence of God, the problem of evil, and a very minimal concept of God (i.e. omniscience, omnipotence, omnibenevolence), Analytic Theologians assume the existence of God and press well into analysis of theological topics not often addressed by philosophy of religion. The third feature that characterizes most analytic theology is an engagement with the wider analytic philosophical or theological literature for concepts that can be applied to answer theological questions. Very often these concepts are deployed in the process of solving questions or conceptual “problems” that accompany certain theological beliefs (e.g. the two natures of Christ, or the question of free will in heaven). This literary aspect may in fact be as essential as the other two.  For example, ideas such as speech-act theory or possible worlds semantics have been applied to theological questions involving divine revelation or foreknowledge. In other words, analytic theology involves not only theology written about with a certain analytic style but an application of ideas found in analytic philosophical literature. 
       
[[File:Characteristics of Analytic Theology.png|thumb|A Venn diagram showing topics covered by analytic theology.]]

====The analytic method====
The most frequently mentioned characteristic of analytic theology is its broad methodological and thematic overlap with analytic philosophy. This is signaled by the shared term “analytic” in both phrases.  An effort to sketch out, tentatively, some rhetorical features that characterised analytic philosophy was first made by philosopher Michael Rea in the introduction to the 2009 edited volume ''Analytic Theology''.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Crisp and Michael C. Rea, eds., Analytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology (Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was that some of these ways of pursuing analysis of topics are found to characterize analytic theology. Rae’s five characteristics are:

*P1. Write as if philosophical positions and conclusions can be adequately formulated in sentences that can be formalized and logically manipulated. 
*P2. Prioritize precision, clarity, and logical coherence. 
*P3 Avoid substantive (non-decorative) use of metaphor and other ropes whose semantic content outstrips their propositional content. 
*P4 Work as much as possible with well-understood primitive concepts, and concepts that can be analyzed in terms of those. 
*P5 Treat conceptual analysis (insofar as it is possible) as a source of evidence.

(Rea’s qualification of each of these principles as well as his discussion of disagreements over them should be consulted):

Imagine, for example, that a theologian writes that Jesus’s cry of dereliction from the cross indicates that the Trinity was broken or ruptured in a mysterious way during Jesus' crucifixion. First, in terms of differentiating AT from philosophy of religion, this is not something likely to be addressed in philosophy of religion. An analytic theologian might ask for what “broken” denotes given its connotations when used in reference to the God of Christianity. Is the original writer merely using rhetorical flare or are they trying to imply an actual ontological change in God? The analytic theologian, given her penchant for theory building, might list out the implications for other Christian doctrines depending on what meaning is intended by the word “broken.” The analytic theologian might turn to the history of theology, especially theologians who were philosophically careful, in search of concepts that help her speak about Christ being “forsaken” by God without doing so in a way that unnecessarily risks contradicting an orthodox understanding of the Trinity.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Thomas H. McCall, ''Forsaken: The Trinity and the Cross, and Why It Matters'' (Downers Grove, Ill: IVP Academic, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Analytic writers are willing to agree with others that there are many things about God that easily outstrip our conceptual abilities. Mystery or apophaticism are not incompatible with Analytic Theology. However the latter are more likely than others to press back when such concepts are used in a way that seem unnecessarily incoherent or risk contradicting other doctrines.

===Analytic theology defined sociologically and historically===
Andrew Chignell has offered a different definition of analytic theology. “Analytic theology is a newly concerted, and well-funded effort on the part of philosophers of religion, theologians and religion scholars to re-engage and learn from one another instead of allowing historical institutional and stylistic barriers to keep them apart.”&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Chignell, “The Two (or Three) Cultures of Analytic Theology: A Roundtable,” ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'' 81, no. 3 (September 1, 2013): 570.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is seen as significant because in some senses analytic theology is not substantially different methodologically than philosophical theology work done in the 1980s and 1990s. For example, [Thomas V. Morris’s] books The Logic of God Incarnate (1986) and Our Idea of God (1991) exemplify the method and style of those working in analytic theology, but predates the current trend by twenty years. 
       
From this perspective, what characterizes analytic theology is sociological as much as methodological. In addition to its stylistic features, analytic theology is a reconciliation between philosophers, theologians, and biblical studies scholars that was less present prior to the mid-2000s. Chignell mentions at least two edited volumes that attempted to bring together philosophers, theologians and scholars of religion to work on questions they had in common.&lt;ref&gt;See Eleonore Stump and Thomas P. Flint, eds., ''University of Notre Dame Studies in the Philosophy of Religion'', vol. 7, "Hermes and Athena: Biblical Exegesis and Philosophical Theology" (Notre Dame, Ind.: University of Notre Dame Press, 1993).  See also, William J. Wainwright, ed., ''Reflection and Theory in the Study of Religion'', vol. 11, "God, Philosophy, and Academic Culture: a Discussion between Scholars in the AAR and the APA" (Atlanta, Ga.: Scholars Press, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to say why the analytic theology movement did not gain momentum prior to Crisp and Rea’s efforts between 2004 and the 2009 publication of ''Analytic Theology''. In their respective fields, Crisp and Rea both witnessed a lack of eagerness for interdisciplinary interaction between philosophy and theology.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Rea, “Analytic Theology: Precis,” ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'' 81, no. 3 (September 1, 2013): 573.&lt;/ref&gt; One possibility for the delay is that more time was needed (in the mid-1990s) before works by Richard Swinburne, Thomas Flint, Nicholas Wolterstorff, Eleonore Stump, Alvin Plantinga and others made room in the theological academy for a movement like analytic theology. 
       
An alternative, and significant factor, is the role the John Templeton Foundation played in funding projects connected with analytic theology.  It is not inconsequential that the John Templeton Foundation has helped to fund analytic theology-type projects on three continents, including: North America, at the University of Notre Dame’s Center for Philosophy of Religion; in Europe, at the Munich School of Philosophy and University of Innsbruck; and, in the Middle East, at the Shalem Center and then later the Herzl Institute in Jerusalem. More recent Templeton-funded initiatives include a three-year project at Fuller Theological Seminary in California and the establishment of Logos Institute for Analytic and Exegetical Theology at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland.”&lt;ref&gt;Joshua R. Farris and James M. Arcadi, “Introduction to the Topical Issue ‘Analytic Perspectives on Method and Authority in Theology,’” ''Open Theology'' 3, no. 1 (November 27, 2017), 630.&lt;/ref&gt;  
       
Whatever the link between the rise of AT and funding might be, it is unlikely that funding alone accounts for the flourishing in work that has appeared in the last decade. It certainly has nothing to do with the rich precursors to the AT movement in the 1980’s and 1990’s. For this reason, understanding the 20th-century shifts in Anglo-American philosophy is important to understanding the appearance of analytic theology. 
       
==The history of analytic theology==
Historically demarcating movements (e.g. the Early Modern period of European history) is always imperfect.  Many intellectual movements rise and fall like a bell curve rather than appearing suddenly as with clear boundaries.  Analytic theology is no different. It should be thought of as the result of a wave cresting and not the result of a few contemporary individuals. Those currently working analytic theology derive their momentum from previous scholarship.

[[File:History of Analytic Theology.png|thumb|Figure 2]]
 
Contemporary analytic theology, represented by scholars like Oliver Crisp and Michael Rea, has its roots in three periods of Western philosophical history. These are indicated by the three “rising tide” levels in Figure 2. These periods include: (a) historic Scholastic philosophical theology (b) Mid 20th’ century responses by Christian philosophers to challenges of religious epistemology and religious language about God (c) a turn by Christian philosophers to work on more traditionally theological topics in the 1980s. 
       
As noted above, analytic theology is a contemporary movement. It is a resurgence in philosophical-theology that began in the UK and US. However, this movement has always had a strong retrieval element to it. Retrieval theology refers to thinkers revisiting and reappropriating certain ideas from historical theology or philosophy.  In analytic theology this retrieval often includes a revisitation to the works of theologian-philosophers like Augustine, Duns Scotus, Anselm, Thomas Aquinas, and Jonathan Edwards.  How then did a contemporary movement wind up with roots in a period of the Western intellectual tradition that is hundreds of years old? 
	
In Medieval Europe, a rich tradition of philosophical thought about theological topics, flourished for over a thousand years. This tradition of philosophical theology was brought into steep decline by the philosophy of Immanuel Kant and the theology of Friedrich Schleiermacher.&lt;ref&gt;See Nicholas Wolterstorff, “Is It Possible and Desirable for Theologians to Recover from Kant?,” ''Modern Theology'' 14, no. 1 (January 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th-century, logical positivism stands as the low water-mark of philosophical theology with its denial of the very possibility to talk meaningfully about God at all. As a result, a very robust dividing wall separated philosophy and theology by the middle of the 20th century. (See Figure 2). The story of analytic theology usually begins at this point with Logical Positivism. 
       
In August 1929 a group of philosophers in Vienna, sometimes referred to as the Vienna Circle, published a manifesto containing a verificationist criterion to be used as a criteria by which statements could be analyzed in terms of meaning.  Any statements that could not be broken down into empirically verifiable concepts were held to be meaningless thus preventing any metaphysical (i.e. theological) dialogue as counting as meaningful. 
       
In the middle of the 20th century this verification principle began to crumble under the weight of its own strictness on at least four counts: (a) No satisfactory concept of empirical verifiability could be agreed upon; (b) Supporters of logical positivism like Carl Hempel argued that it seemed to invalidate less strictly worded universal generalizations of science; (c) Ordinary language philosophers argued that it rendered meaningless imperatives, interrogatives, and other performative utterances.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Gasser, “Toward Analytic Theology: An Itinerary,” ''Scientia et Fides'' 3, no. 2 (November 4, 2015): 27.&lt;/ref&gt; (d) Furthermore, the verification principle itself was not empirically verifiable by its own standards. 
       
In the 1950s logical positivism evaporated and with it the threat that metaphysical claims were meaningless. Conversation shifted to grounds that required speakers to show why theological or philosophical claims were true or false. This had a liberating effect on analytic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Gasser, “Toward Analytic Theology,” 31.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nicholas Wolterstorff, the demise of Logical Positivism also had the effect of throwing doubt over any subsequent attempts, like Kant or the Logical Positivists, to point out a deep epistemological boundary between the knowable and unknowable, the thinkable and unthinkable. This put a crack in the wall that had divided theology and philosophy for centuries. Wolterstorff states that one result of the demise of logical positivism “has proved to be that the theme of limits on the thinkable and the assertible has lost virtually all interest for philosophers in the analytic tradition. Of course, analytic philosophers do still on occasion charge people with failing to think a genuine thought or make a genuine judgment. But the tacit assumption has come to be that such claims will always have to be defended on an individual, ad hoc, basis; deep skepticism reigns among analytic philosophers concerning all grand proposals for demarcating the thinkable from the unthinkable, the assertible from the non-assertible.”&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Wolterstorff, “How Philosophical Theology Became Possible within the Analytic Tradition of Philosophy,” in ''Analytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology'', ed. Oliver Crisp and Michael C. Rea (Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), 157.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wolterstorff also suggests that classical-foundationalism collapsed as the de facto theory of epistemology in philosophy, but it was not replaced by an alternative theory. What has resulted was an environment of dialogical pluralism where no major epistemological framework (e.g. classical foundationalism or idealism) is widely held.&lt;ref&gt;Wolterstorff, “How Philosophical Theology Became Possible,” 159-161.&lt;/ref&gt;
       
In this context of dialogical pluralism, the state of play returned to one in which metaphysical or theistic belief could be taken as rational provided one could give justification for those beliefs. Two mechanisms for doing this became popular: Reformed Epistemology (See. Alvin Plantinga &amp; Nicholas Wolterstorff) and evidentialist approaches that made use of Bayesian probability (See. Richard Swinburne). Either way, logical argumentation and rational coherence remained important for such beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Gasser, “Toward Analytic Theology”, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to arguments for rational belief in God, Christian philosophers also began to give arguments for the rationality of various aspects of belief within a theistic worldview. Examples here would be the coherence of certain traditional attributes of God or the possibility that the existence of God was not logically incompatible with the existence of evil in the world). 
       
In 1978 the [Society of Christian Philosophers] was formed. Six years later Alvin Plantinga delivered his famous presidential addresses “Advice to Christian Philosophers” in which he signaled the need for Christians working in that field to do more than follow the assumptions and approaches to philosophy accepted in the wider field, given that many of those assumptions were antithetical to Christianity. He goes on to write that

|text=Christian philosophers, however, are the philosophers of the Christian community; and it is part of their task as Christian philosophers to serve the Christian community. But the Christian community has its own questions, its own concerns, its own topics for investigation, its own agenda and its own research program. Christian philosophers ought not merely take their inspiration from what's going on at Princeton or Berkeley or Harvard, attractive and scintillating as that may be; for perhaps those questions and topics are not the ones, or not the only ones, they should be thinking about as the philosophers of the Christian community. There are other philosophical topics the Christian community must work at, and other topics the Christian community must work at philosophically. And obviously, Christian philosophers are the ones who must do the philosophical work involved. If they devote their best efforts to the topics fashionable to the non-Christian philosophical world, they will neglect a crucial and central part of their task as Christian philosophers. What is needed here is more independence, more autonomy with respect to the projects and concerns of the non-theistic philosophical world.&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Plantinga, “Advice to Christian Philosophers,” ''Faith and Philosophy'' 1, no. 3 (1984): 253–271.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
      
In the 1980s and 1990s Christian philosophers did, in fact, begin to turn much of their efforts to explicating questions unique to Christian theology, thereby setting the precedent for the type of work done in analytic theology. The decades saw the production of more literature by Christian philosophers treating theological topics such as the attributes of God the atonement by scholars like[Richard Swinburne.  However, much of that work remained largely appreciated by Christian philosophers and less so by Christian theologians.    As noted in the analytic theology Defined as a Movement section, both Oliver Crisp and Michael Rea found that philosophers and theologians were not interacting and sharing resources as late as the mid-2000s.  It was in the mid-2000s at Notre Dame that they floated the idea of an edited volume aimed at bringing philosophers and theologians together to work on theological questions with a methodology tuned to the style and resources of analytic philosophy.

|text=As we discussed the matter, we thought that perhaps a volume might be called for a volume tendentiously entitled Analytic Theology, which would include a few essays making a case directed toward theologians on behalf of analytic approaches to theological topics, a few essays that offered criticism of such approaches, and a few more essays that addressed some of the historical, methodological, and epistemological issues that seemed to lurk in the background of the disciplinary divide. Broadly speaking, our primary task in the volume was to say a bit about what we take “analytic theology” to consist in, and then to make a sort of cumulative case in favor of its being a worthwhile enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Rea, “Analytic Theology: Precis,” ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'' 81, no. 3 (September 1, 2013): 573.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
        
It was with the publication of this volume that AT began to take off and get attention, both positive and negative, in philosophical and theological circles. In 2012 a session at the American Academy of Religion was dedicated to discussing the volume, followed by several articles in volume 81 the AAR journal. In 2013 the Journal of analytic theology was begun, which is now in its sixth year. In 2015, Thomas McCall, professor of Theology at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School published An Invitation to Analytic Christian Theology with IVP. The following year at the 2016 Evangelical Theological Society annual conference a series of papers were given interacting with McCall’s book to a packed room. By the close of the second decade of the 21st-century, several multiple year projects have been funded at graduate level institutions that focus on Analytic Theology. Edited volumes, such as those in the Oxford Studies in analytic theology series, continue to be released. Several dissertations have now been published, as monographs, that treat theological topics in an Analytic Style, and both the AAR and ETS continue to have regular sections devoted to papers on Analytic Theology.

==Analytic theology compared to other disciplines==
In a 2013 volume of the Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Andrew Chignell notes that some of the reviewers and writers in the 2009 analytic theology edited volume wondered what the difference, if any, was between analytic theology and philosophical theology.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Chignell, “The Two (or Three) Cultures of Analytic Theology: A Roundtable,” ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'' 81, no. 3 (September 1, 2013): 569–570.&lt;/ref&gt; Chignell’s definition brings out an important question. Similarly one might ask what the difference between analytic theology and the Analytic Philosophy of Religion is.&lt;ref&gt;Max Baker-Hytch, “Analytic Theology and Analytic Philosophy of Religion: What’s the Difference?,” ''Journal of Analytic Theology'' 4 (May 2016): 347.&lt;/ref&gt; Demarcating boundaries between disciplines can be difficult. This is no different with analytic theology. Therefore, suggestions will be disputed. However, here are a few distinctions. 
       
* '''Analytic theology versus philosophical theology.''' The difference between Analytic Theology and [[philosophical theology]] is largely sociological or historic. Analytic theology just is philosophical theology applied by theologians with philosophical methods and sensitivities. In time, as analytic theologians listen to the calls by Biblical Theologians to be more sensitive to exegetical issues, there might develop a slight difference between even philosophical theology and analytic theology.
* '''Analytic theology versus philosophy of religion.'''The difference between Analytic Theology and the [[philosophy of religion]], is more of a difference in scope. Given that AT grew out of Anglo-American philosophy of religion, they share much of the same history up until the 1990s. However, Analytic Theology is willing to treat topics of Christian theology that one will not see addressed in philosophy of religion. Furthermore, analytic theologians are not focused on proving the existence of God. Instead, they will begin with God’s existence, and the deliverances of their particular Christian tradition, and work on theological questions with the tools of analytic philosophy. Andrew Chignell suggests something like this in writing:
       
{{Quote
|text=Philosophy of religion involves arguments about religiously pertinent philosophical issues, of course, but these arguments are customarily constructed in such a way that, ideally, anyone will be able to feel their probative force on the basis of ‘reason alone.’ Analytic theology, by contrast, appeals to sources of topics and evidence that go well beyond our collective heritage as rational beings with the standard complement of cognitive faculties.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Chignell, “As Kant Has Shown,” in ''Analytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology'', ed. Oliver Crisp and Michael C. Rea (Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), 119.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to treating a wider range of topics than philosophy of religion, and focusing on a slightly narrower audience, AT may differ from the philosophy of religion in the way it makes use of Scripture and tradition as evidence in its methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Max Baker-Hytch presses on this last possible difference by calling Analytic Theologians to specify exactly what it is about its use of Scripture and tradition that distinguishes it from philosophy of religion. See Max Baker-Hytch, “Analytic Theology and Analytic Philosophy of Religion: What’s the Difference?,” ''Journal of Analytic Theology'' 4 (May 2016): 347-361.&lt;/ref&gt; }}
	
* '''Analytic theology versus systematic theology.''' The difference between analytic theology and [[systematic theology]] is a third question that has been raised. Michael Rea’s introduction in the 2009 analytic theology volume has not been received well by some theologians. Analytic Theology has thus been challenged as legitimately theology. Some suspect it is no more than philosophy in theological costume. William Abraham argues that analytic theology is in fact systematic theology and that it was only a matter of time before something like analytic theology took root in the theological world.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Abraham, “Systematic Theology as Analytic Theology,” in ''Analytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology'', ed. Oliver Crisp and Michael C. Rea (Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), 54–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Oliver Crisp has published an article demonstrating how analytic theology could qualify itself as systematic theology. Crisp cites leading theologians to demonstrate that there is no agreed-upon definition for systematic theology. He then shows how analytic theology shares a common task and goals with systematic theology and rises above a conceptual threshold established by the way various theologians view systematic theology.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver D. Crisp, “Analytic Theology as Systematic Theology,” Open Theology 3, no. 1 (January 26, 2017): 156–166.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 interview, Oliver Crisp suggests that analytic theology is not attempting to take over the work of theology, but is instead suggesting an additional set of resources that theologians could turn to in order to find help in their theological projects.&lt;ref&gt;See https://www.closertotruth.com/episodes/what-analytic-theology&lt;/ref&gt;
       
Analytic theology thus sits at the boundaries between a number of disciplines as suggested by '''Figure 3'''.

 [[File:Analytic Theology in Relation to Other Disciplines.png|thumb|Figure 3.]]

==Motivations For analytic theology==
       
Why would students and scholars want to do theological work in an analytic style? At least three motivations exist:

# &lt;u&gt;A motivation to find possible solutions to theological challenges.&lt;/u&gt; The history of theology has demonstrated that times of disagreement during the church’s history have produced advances in theological clarity and depth. Theological disagreements force parties to be clear about their terminology, thought processes, and values. Disagreement also motivates thinkers to look for new solutions to prior conceptual problems. During the 20th-century, challenges to Christian theology by many thinkers like Anthony Flew, William Rowe and John Hick provoked responses by philosophers like Basil Mitchell, Alvin Plantinga and Thomas Morris which proved to be valued by many Christian theologians. By way of example, Christians have held for centuries that God answers petitionary prayer. More than one philosopher has offers a strong argument for the incompatibility of answered prayer and divine foreknowledge. It is easy to see the strong desire for a solution to the puzzle. Analytic theology, thanks to its careful way of proceeding and its access to philosophical concepts, offers conceptual tools to work out explanations to solutions, rather than just asserting that answered prayer is possible (e.g. rather than merely citing Bible passages like James 5:15-18). 
# &lt;u&gt;A motivation to consider theological topics and challenges from a fresh perspective.&lt;/u&gt; Some theological words (e.g. love, judgement) are widely used without reflection because they are part of everyday language. However, clarifying what words like “love” refer to (rather than mistaking the effects of love for the meaning of “love” ) can bring a fresh perspective to old discussions. Christians might know for example that God loves us, and that the evidence of love is patience and kindness. If love is defined as a desire for the good of the beloved and for union with the beloved (an insight from Thomas Aquinas) new vistas of thought open up. One suddenly has criteria by which to identify patient actions that are genuinely loving patient and kind acts that are driven by other motives. 
# &lt;u&gt;A motivation to reap the benefits of clearer thinking in theological writing.&lt;/u&gt; When responding to conceptual challenges, writers sometimes offer “solutions” that, in hindsight, turn out to be new terms that do little more than rename the problem or put a new label on an old solution. The clear and careful thinking, prized by analytic theologians, can alert others to these dead ends by calling writers to clarify the meanings masked by new terminology, or the to demonstrate the difference between new terms and already existing “solutions.”

==Criticisms of analytic theology==
Some of the following concerns have been voiced over analytic theology. First, “Why do analytic theologians have such conservative theological views?” In other words, is AT just a theological project? Second, “Why do analytic theologians ignore historical-critical biblical studies?” The worry here is also stated as, "Analytic Theologians seem to treat the Bible as a sourcebook for propositions to insert into logical arguments." Thirdly, similar to the second worry, "Does AT genuinely engage Biblical narrative?" Fourth, "Is Analytic Theology genuinely theology is it just philosophy dressed in theological clothing?"

==Practitioners &amp; examples of analytic theology==
       
One of the best ways to become acquainted with a style of work or a movement is to become acquainted with works that are considered to be good examples of that style. As noted in the article above, prior to the mid-2000s most of the scholars doing something like analytic theology were Christian philosophers working on their own projects.

===Practitioners===
       
Given its dual citizenship in theology and philosophy, nothing prevents philosophers, with theological skills, or theologians, with philosophical training, from doing analytic theology. One should expect the scholar’s particular strengths, theology versus philosophy, to take the leading role in their writing. Some of the best work resourced by analytic theologians have been done by philosophers, including nearly all of the past presidents of the Society of Christian Philosophers.   Although artificial, an attempt to list out some leading lights in terms of “generations”

* '''1st Generation''' (Writers who released their first works in the 1960-70’s.) Basil Mitchell, Nicholas Wolterstorff, George Mavrodes, Alvin Plantinga, Richard Swinburne  
* '''2nd Generation''' (Writers who released their first works in the 1980s.) Plantinga/Wolterstorff/Swinburne again, William Hasker, Thomas Flint, Linda Zagzebski, Eleonore Stump, Thomas Morris, James P. Moreland, William J. Abraham
* '''3rd Generation''' (Writers who released works in the 1990s and 2000s) Oliver Crisp, Michael Rea, Thomas McCall, Trent Doughtery, Brian Leftow, Sarah Coakley, etc.. 
* '''4th Generation''' (Writers who released works in the last decade) Tim Pawl, Joshua Farris, JT Turner, James Arcadi, Jordan Wessling, Aku Visala, R.T. Mullins, Kevin Hector, RC Kunst etc.…

===Examples===
       
The literature representative of analytic theology is growing rapidly. A few examples include: ''Analytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology'' (2009) edited by Oliver Crisp and Michael Rea; ''Analytic Theology: A Bibliography'' (2012) by William Abraham, ''An Invitation to Analytic Christian Theology'' (2015) by Thomas H. McCall; ''the Journal of Analytic Theology'', the ''TheoLogica'' journal. Interested scholars should consult the growing series of titles under the Oxford Studies in Analytic Theology.  There are nine titles in the series as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;See https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/o/oxford-studies-in-analytic-theology-osat/&lt;/ref&gt; The PBS series Closer to Truth, released an episode on analytic theology in 2018. Finally, as noted in the sections on the history of analytic theology, there is a much wider body of literature published between 1970 and the 2009 release of the analytic theology that represents the kind of work analytic theologians value and use in their more recent works.

==Geography of analytic theology==
       
Given the above history, it is not unreasonable to suggest that analytic theology had its birth in an Anglo-American world of analytic philosophy. This is in contrast to the German Idealist context of much early 20th-century theology (e.g. Barth, Rahner). Since the publication of the 2009 analytic theology volume, and with the help of several Templeton grants, analytic theology is being done in the UK, USA, Germany, and Israel.  Individual scholars who would count themselves as Analytic Theologians, or supporters of AT, can be found at institutions in the following countries or regions: Spain, Israel, Brazil, France, the UK, Austria, Scandinavia, and North America. 
       
Currently, there are several centers of study where analytic theology is being actively worked on in a departmental setting. These include: Fuller Theological Seminary, the Logos Institute at St. Andrews University, the Center for Philosophy of Religion at Notre Dame University, and the University of Innsbruck.&lt;ref&gt;See Innsbruck: www.uibk.ac.at/analytic-theology/ ; Fuller Seminary: analytictheology.fuller.edu ; St. Andrews: logos.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk ; and Notre Dame: philreligion.nd.edu/research-initiatives/analytic-theology.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernard-Henri Lévy''' ({{IPAc-en|l|eɪ|ˈ|v|iː}}; {{IPA-fr|bɛʁnaʁ ɑ̃ʁi levi|lang}}; born 5 November 1948) is a French [[public intellectual]], media personality, and author. Often referred to in France simply as '''BHL''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=25 June 2008|title=Rousselet et BHL entrent au capital de ''Libération''|url= http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/medias/20070104.OBS5464/rousselet_et_bhl_entrentau_capital_de_liberation.html|work=Le nouvel Observateur }}&lt;/ref&gt; he was one of the leaders of the "[[New Philosophers|Nouveaux Philosophes]]" (New Philosophers) movement in 1976.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Lévy was born in 1948 in [[Béni Saf]], [[French Algeria]], to an affluent [[History of the Jews in Algeria|Algerian Jewish]] family. His family moved to Paris a few months after his birth. His father, [[André Lévy (businessman)|André Lévy]], was the founder and manager of a timber company, Becob, and became a multimillionaire from his business.&lt;ref&gt;Kirsch, Jonathan.  [http://www.jewishjournal.com/cover_story/article/bernard_henri_levy_bares_his_jewish_soul "Bernard-Henri Lévy bares his Jewish soul."] ''Jewish Journal''.  11 January 2017.  17 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
He is the brother of Philippe Levy and {{ill|Véronique Lévy|fr}}.

After attending the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] in Paris, Lévy made his way into the elite and highly selective [[École Normale Supérieure]] in 1968, from which he graduated with a degree in philosophy. His professors there included prominent French intellectuals and philosophers [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Louis Althusser]].

Lévy became a pre-eminent journalist, having started his career as a [[war correspondent]] for ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', the newspaper founded underground by [[Albert Camus]] during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation of France]]. In 1971, Lévy travelled to the [[Indian subcontinent]], and was based in Bangladesh covering the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] against Pakistan. He was inspired by a call for an International Brigade&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/28/bernard-henri-levy-andre-malraux-s-bangladesh-before-the-radicals|title=Bernard-Henri Levy: Andre Malraux's Bangladesh, Before the Radicals|last=Lévy|first=Bernard-Henri|date=2014-04-28|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; to aid Bangladeshi freedom fighters made by [[André Malraux]].&lt;ref name="BHL in Dhaka"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/uncategorized/2014/05/27/bhl-in-dhaka|title=BHL in Dhaka|date=2014-05-27|work=Dhaka Tribune|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently spent part of 1972 working as a civil servant for the Bangladesh Ministry of Economy and Planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bernard-henri-levy.com/bhl-in-dhaka-interview-de-bernard-henri-levy-par-niaz-alam-dhaka-tribune-le-28-mai-2014-43883.html|title="BHL in Dhaka", interview de Bernard-Henri Lévy par Niaz Alam (Dhaka Tribune, le 28 mai 2014) : Bernard-Henri Lévy|website=www.bernard-henri-levy.com|language=fr-FR|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This experience was the source of his first book, ''Bangla-Desh, Nationalisme dans la révolution'' ("Bangladesh, Nationalism in the Revolution", 1973).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/176951/bernard-henri-levy-2|title=On the Road With Bernard-Henri Lévy, the Planet's Last Superstar French Intellectual|last=Davidzon|first=Vladislav|date=26 June 2014|website=Tablet|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He visited Bangladesh in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/bernardhenri-levy/an-emotional-return-to-ba_b_5206352.html|title=An Emotional Return to Bangladesh -- After 43 Years|last=Lévy|first=Bernard-Henri|date=2014-04-24|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to speak at the launch of the first Bengali translation of this book and to open a memorial garden for Malraux at Dhaka University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bd.ambafrance.org/Opening-of-the-Malraux-Garden-at|title=Opening of the Malraux Garden at the University of Dhaka|website=La France au Bangladesh - Ambassade de France à Dacca|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Philosophers===
Returning to Paris, Lévy became known as a founder of the [[New Philosophers]] (''Nouveaux Philosophes'') school. This was a group of young intellectuals who were disenchanted with communist and socialist responses to the [[May 1968 in France|near-revolutionary upheavals in France of May 1968]], and who developed an uncompromising moral critique of Marxist and socialist [[dogma]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alexander|first=Beth R.|date=10 November 2004|title=Commentary: Bernard Henri-Lévy takes heat|agency=UPI|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7172525_ITM|quote=... a group who broke away from the Marxist ideology dominating late 1960s France and the hard-line French left typified by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].|work=UPI Perspectives}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, the television show ''[[Apostrophes (talk show)|Apostrophes]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Apostrophes'' was a French TV program hosted by [[Bernard Pivot]].&lt;/ref&gt; featured Lévy together with [[André Glucksmann]] as a ''nouveau philosophe''. In that year, he published ''Barbarism with a Human Face'' (''La barbarie à visage humain'', 1977), arguing that Marxism was inherently corrupt. Throughout the 1970s, Lévy taught a course on [[epistemology]] at the [[University of Strasbourg]] and he also taught philosophy at the [[École Normale Supérieure]].

===Intellectual involvement===
In 1981, Lévy published ''L'Idéologie française'' ("The French Ideology"), arguably his most influential work, in which he offers a dark picture of French history. It was strongly criticised for its journalistic character and unbalanced approach to French history by some of the most respected French academics, including Marxism-critic [[Raymond Aron]] (see his ''Memoirs'').

In the 1990s, Lévy called for European and American intervention in the [[Bosnian War]] during the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]]. He spoke about the Serb POW camps which were holding [[Muslims]]. He referred to the Jewish experience in [[the Holocaust]] as providing a lesson that mass murder cannot be ignored by those in other nations.&lt;ref name=leadel/&gt;

At the end of the 1990s, with [[Benny Lévy]] and [[Alain Finkielkraut]], Lévy founded an Institute on [[Emmanuel Levinas|Levinassian]] Studies at Jerusalem, in honor of [[Emmanuel Levinas]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.levinas.fr/institut/institut.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

He is member of nonprofit advocacy group [[JCall]]. In March 2006, Lévy was one of twelve signatories of a letter entitled, "[[MANIFESTO: Together facing the new totalitarianism]]."' addressing concerns for free speech and thought in response to violent and deadly protests in the [[Muslim world]] related to the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]] that arose in Denmark.

===Books===

====''Who Killed Daniel Pearl?''====
In 2003, Lévy wrote an account of his efforts to track the murderer of [[Daniel Pearl]], the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reporter who was taken captive and beheaded by Islamic extremists the previous year. At the time of Pearl's death, Lévy was visiting [[Afghanistan]] as French President [[Jacques Chirac]]'s special envoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graff|first=James|date=4 May 2003|title=The Engaged Intellect|volume=161|issue=19|journal=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,449446,00.html|quote=The Envoy: At the request of French President Jacques Chirac, Lévy traveled to Afghanistan in February 2002 to gauge the needs of the Afghan people... }}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the next year in Pakistan, India, Europe and the United States trying to uncover why Pearl's captors held and executed him. The resulting book, ''Who Killed Daniel Pearl?'', argues it was because Pearl knew too much about the links between Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] and [[al-Qaeda]]. The book was strongly criticized by both experts and Pearl's own family, including wife [[Mariane Pearl]] who called Lévy "a man whose intelligence is destroyed by his own ego".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Nicolas Beau]] and Olivier Toscer, ''Une imposture française'', Éditions des Arènes, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levy|first1=Justine|title=Justine Levy, Daughter of French Public Intellectual BHL, Writes What She Knows: Life|url=http://jewishbusinessnews.com/2015/02/27/justine-levy-daughter-of-french-public-intellectual-bhl-writes-what-she-knows-life/|website=Jewishbusinessnews|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was condemned by [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]], a British historian of India and travel writer, and others, for its lack of rigour and its caricatured depictions of Pakistani society. Dalrymple also criticized Lévy's fictionalised account of Pearl's thoughts in the last moments of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Escobar, Pepe, [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/EF28Df02.html "Who killed Daniel Pearl?"

====''In the Footsteps of Tocqueville''====
Although Lévy's books have been translated into the English language since ''La Barbarie à visage humain'', his breakthrough in gaining a wider US audience was the publication of a series of essays between May and November 2005 for ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' later collected as a book.&lt;ref name="Keillor 1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Keillor|first=Garrison|title=On the Road Avec M. Lévy|work=The New York Times|page=1|date=29 January 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/29/books/review/29keillor.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the series, ''In the Footsteps of Tocqueville'', Lévy criss-crossed the United States, interviewing Americans, and recording his observations, with direct reference to his claimed predecessor, [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]. His work was published in serial form in the magazine and collected as a book by the same title. The book was widely criticized in the United States, with [[Garrison Keillor]] publishing a damning review on the front page of the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]''.&lt;ref name="Keillor 1"/&gt;

====''The Spirit of Judaism''====

In February 2016, Lévy published a new book entitled ''L'Esprit du Judaisme''. An English version, ''The Genius of Judaism'', was published by [[Random House]] in January 2017. In his foreword he describes this work as "a sequel, 40 years later" to ''Testament de Dieu'', his earlier, widely considered seminal, opus. The book explores the reasons why the State of Israel is considered to be a litmus test for Jews and non-Jews alike; as well as the roots and causes of [[anti-Semitism]] where it existed, still exists, or is newly nascent. But, most of all, the book is devoted to Levy's ″defense of a certain idea of man and God, of history and time, of power, voice, light, sovereignty, revolt, memory, and nature—an idea that contains what I call, in homage to one of the few really great French writers to have understood some of its mystery, the genius of Judaism.″&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.momentmag.com/bernard-henri-levy/|title=Bernard-Henri Lévy|date=4 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation in other media==

===In film===
Lévy directed the widely panned 1997 romance film ''[[Day and Night (1997 film)|Day and Night]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite film|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119418/ |title=Le jour et la nuit |first=Bernard-Henri |last=Lévy |date=12 February 1997 |location=France}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered by critics [[List of films considered the worst|the worst film of 1997]] along with ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]''. The movie received a 3.5&amp;nbsp;million francs public subsidy through the ''Commission des avances sur recettes'', which at the time was chaired by Lévy.&lt;ref name="Ajavon"&gt;[[François-Xavier Ajavon]], [http://www.nanarland.com/divers/divers.php?id=8 "Symbolisme et temporalité bergsonnienne dans ''Le Jour et la Nuit'' de Bernard-Henri Levy"], Nanarland.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Italian conceptual artist, [[Francesco Vezzoli]], created two commercials for an imaginary U.S. presidential campaign, in which he had actress [[Sharon Stone]] running against Bernard-Henri Lévy. His project entitled ''Democrazy,'' was shown at the 2007 [[Venice Biennale]].

===Pie throwing===
Bernard Henri Lévy is a favorite victim of [[pie throwing|pie thrower]] [[Noël Godin]].&lt;ref name="Entarteur"&gt;''Bernard-Henry Lévy à nouveau "entarté" en Belgique'', [http://www.liberation.fr/depeches/2015/05/30/bernard-henry-levy-a-nouveau-entarte-en-belgique_1319980].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent activities===
[[File:Bernard-Henri Lévy-tau-2.jpg|thumb|Bernard-Henri Lévy at [[Tel Aviv University]]]]

In September 2008, Lévy toured the United States to promote his book ''[[Left in Dark Times: A Stand Against the New Barbarism]]''.

In 2006, Lévy joined the [[British debate over veils|British debate over Muslim women's veils]] by suggesting to ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' that wearing a veil had the effect of dehumanizing the wearer by hiding her face – and said, alluding to a passage by [[Emmanuel Levinas]], that "the veil is an invitation to rape".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'', 14 October 2006. Not available online, quote in context: "Our time is almost up, but BHL becomes the most animated I have seen him when I ask him about Jack Straw's intervention on Muslim women and the veil. 'Jack Straw', he says, leaning close to me, 'made a great point. He did not say that he was against the veil. He said it is much easier, much more comfortable, respectful, to speak with a woman with a naked face. And without knowing, he quoted [[Emmanuel Lévinas|Levinas]], who is the philosopher of the face. Levinas says that [having seen] the naked face of your interlocutor, you cannot kill him or her, you cannot rape him, you cannot violate him. So when the Muslims say that the veil is to protect women, it is the contrary. The veil is an invitation to rape.{{'"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 June 2009, Lévy posted a video on [[Dailymotion]] in support of the [[2009 Iranian election protests|Iranian protesters who were being repressed after the contested elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymotion.com/user/BernardHL/video/x9o0n8_message-to-the-young-people-of-iran_news Message to the Young People of Iran by Bernard-Henri Lévy – une vidéo Nieuws &amp; Politiek].

He is a member of the Selection Committee of the Editions Grasset, and he runs the ''La Règle du Jeu'' ("The Rule of the Game") magazine. He writes a weekly column in the magazine ''Le Point'' and chairs the Conseil de Surveillance of [[Arte|La Sept-Arte]].

Through the 2000s, Lévy argued that the world must pay more attention to the [[Darfur genocide|crisis in Darfur]].&lt;ref name=leadel/&gt; In ''Left in Dark Times'', he argued that the Darfur genocide was not a palatable issue for modern leftists because it did not provide a platform for the anti-American views with which he says leftist thought has become suffused.

In January 2010, he publicly defended Popes [[Pius XII]] and [[Benedict XVI]] against political attacks directed against them from within the Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.7sur7.be/7s7/fr/1505/Monde/article/detail/1056957/2010/01/20/Bernard-Henri-Levy-defend-Benoit-XVI-et-Pie-XII.dhtml "Bernard-Henri Lévy défend Benoît XVI et Pie XII"]. 7sur7.be, 20 January 2010. Retrieved 19 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the opening of the "Democracy and its Challenges" conference in [[Tel Aviv]] (May 2010) Lévy gave a very high estimation of the [[Israel Defense Forces]], saying "I have never seen such a democratic army, which asks itself so many moral questions. There is something unusually vital about Israeli democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/bernard-henri-levy-i-have-never-seen-an-army-as-democratic-as-the-idf-1.293087|author=Or Kashti|title=Bernard Henri Levy: I have never seen an army as democratic as the IDF|work=Haaretz|date=30 May 2010| accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lévy has reported from troubled zones during wartime, to attract public opinion, in France and abroad, over those political changes. In August 2008, Lévy reported from South Ossetia, Georgia, during the [[2008 South Ossetia war]]; on that occasion he interviewed the President of Georgia, [[Mikheil Saakashvili]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard-Henri Lévy, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bernardhenri-levy/georgia-at-war-what-i-saw_b_120076.html "Georgia at War: What I Saw"], ''The Huffington Post'', 20 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, he engaged in talks with Libyan rebels in [[Benghazi]], and publicly promoted the international acknowledgement of the recently formed [[National Transitional Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xhdrv8_l-appel-de-bhl-depuis-benghazi-libye-en-direct-sur-tf1-au_news L'appel de BHL depuis Benghazi (Libye) en direct sur TF1 au – une vidéo Nieuws &amp; Politiek].

In May 2011, Lévy defended IMF Chief [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]] when Kahn was accused of sexually assaulting a chambermaid in New York City. Lévy questioned the credibility of the charges against Strauss-Kahn, asking ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', "how a chambermaid could have walked in alone, contrary to the habitual practice of most of New York's grand hotels of sending a 'cleaning brigade' of two people, into the room of one of the most closely watched figures on the planet."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-05-16/bernard-henri-lvy-the-dominique-strauss-kahn-i-know/ "Dominique Strauss-Kahn: Bernard-Henri Lévy Defends IMF Director"].

In May 2011, Lévy argued for military intervention in Syria against [[Bashar al-Assad]] after violence against civilians in response to the [[2011 Syrian uprising]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/world/88662/bashar-al-assad-syria-qaddafi-arab-spring|author=Bernard-Henri Levy|title=After Qaddafi, Assad|work=[[The New Republic]]|date=19 May 2011|accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He repeated his position in a letter to the [[Weekly Standard]] in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Halper, [http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/experts-obama-here-what-do-syria_751267.html "Experts to Obama: Here Is What to Do in Syria"], ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', 27 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lévy curated a major art exhibition in 2013 entitled ''Adventures of truth – Painting and philosophy: a narrative'' at the [[Maeght Foundation]].

He criticized the international community for their acts during the [[Bosnia genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bernardhenri-levy/the-significance-of-saraj_b_4148799.html |work=Huffington Post |first=Bernard-Henri |last=Lévy |title=The Significance of Sarajevo |date=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levy was in Kiev, Ukraine during the [[2014 Ukrainian Revolution|Maidan Revolution]] in February 2014, actively promoting the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/op-ed/bernard-henri-levy-remembering-the-maidan-385357.html |work=Kyiv Post |first=Bernard-Henri |last=Levy |title=Bernard-Henri Levy: Remembering the Maidan |date=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, he performed his play ''Hotel Europa'' at the Kiev opera house on the first anniversary of the Euromaidan's toppling of the pro-Russian government of Victor Yanukovich.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Bernard-Henri Levy will perform his 'Hotel Europe' play in Kyiv's opera house on Feb. 21|url = http://test.kyivpost.com/article/content/ukraine-politics/bernard-henri-levy-will-perform-his-hotel-europe-play-in-kyivs-opera-house-on-feb-21-380982.html|work=Kyiv Post|date=18 February 2015|accessdate = 16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, he visited Bangladesh for the first time since 1972 to speak at the launch of the first Bengali translation of his first book  ''Bangla-Desh, Nationalisme dans la révolution'' ("Bangladesh, Nationalism in the Revolution", 1973), and to open a memorial garden for Malraux at Dhaka University.&lt;ref name="BHL in Dhaka"/&gt;

On 5 June 2018 he performed his one-man play ''Last Exit before Brexit'' at the [[Cadogan Hall]] in London. The play is a revised version of ''Hotel Europa'' and argues passionately that [[Brexit]] should be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/05/please-please-remain-bernard-henri-levy-performs-one-man-brexit-play|title='Please, please remain': Bernard-Henri Lévy performs one-man Brexit play|date=5 June 2018|access-date=6 June 2018| website=theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lévy has also been regularly contributing to  Project Syndicate since 2015.

Lévy's involvement with the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] cause goes back to the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Algemeiner1"&gt;{{cite web | last=Cohen | first=Ben | title=Bernard-Henri Lévy: Jews Have 'Special Obligation' to Support Kurdish Independence | website=Algemeiner.com | date=September 25, 2017 | url=https://www.algemeiner.com/2017/09/25/bernard-henri-levy-jews-have-special-obligation-to-support-kurdish-independence/ | access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 16, 2016, Bernard-Henri Lévy's new documentary film, ''Peshmerga'', was chosen by the Cannes film festival as a special screening to its official selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-festival-adds-peshmerga-official-894343|title=Cannes Adds Bernard-Henri Levy's 'Peshmerga' to Official Selection|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The movie itself is, as stated in its official Cannes presentation: "The third part of a trilogy, opus three of  a documentary made and lived in real time, the missing piece of the puzzle of a lifetime, the desperate search for enlightened Islam. Where is that other Islam strong enough to defeat the Islam of the fundamentalists? Who embodies it? Who sustains it? Where are the men and women who in word and deed strive for that enlightened Islam, the Islam of law and human rights, an Islam that stands for women and their rights, that is faithful to the lofty thinking of Averroes, Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani, Ibn Tufail, and Rumi?... Here, with this third film, this hymn to Kurdistan and the exception that it embodies, I have the feeling of possibly reaching my goal. Kurdistan is Sunnis and Shiites, Chaldeans, Assyrians, Aramaic-speaking Syrians living freely with Muslims, the memory of the Jews of Aqrah, secularism, freedom of conscience and belief. It is where one can run into a Jewish Barzani on the forward line of a front held, 50 kilometers from Erbil, by his distant cousin, a Muslim, Sirwan Barazi… Better than the Arab Spring. The Bosnian dream achieved. My dream. There is no longer really any doubt. Enlightened Islam exists: I found it in Erbil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/62158.html|title=Festival de Cannes - Site Officiel / Institutionnel|website=Festival de Cannes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/islamic-state-will-be-defeated-1441233971|title=Islamic State Will Be Defeated|first=Bernard-Henri|last=Lévy|date=2 September 2015|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Lévy said that "Jews have a special obligation to support the Kurds," and that he hopes "they will come say to the Peshmerga: 'For years now you have spilled your blood to defend the values of our shared civilization. Now it is our turn to defend your right to live freely and independently.'"&lt;ref name="Algemeiner1"/&gt;

==Criticisms==
Early essays, such as ''Le Testament de Dieu'' or ''L'Idéologie française'' faced strong rebuttals from noted intellectuals on all sides of the ideological spectrum, such as historian [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]] and philosophers [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Raymond Aron]], and [[Gilles Deleuze]], who called Lévy's methods "vile".&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Deleuze, [http://www.acrimed.org/A-propos-des-nouveaux-philosophes-et-d-un-probleme-plus-general-Gilles-Deleuze A propos des nouveaux philosophes et d'un problème plus général], first published in May 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Lévy was publicly embarrassed when his essay ''De la guerre en philosophie'' (2010) cited the writings of French "philosopher" [[Jean-Baptiste Botul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article7019866.ece|work=The Times|location=London|title=BernardHenri Lvy a laughing stock for quoting fictional philosopher|date=9 February 2010|accessdate=26 April 2010|first=Charles|last=Bremner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Botul's writings are actually well-known spoofs, and Botul himself is the purely fictional creation of a living French journalist and philosopher, [[Frédéric Pagès]]. The obviousness of the hoax led to suspicions that Levy had not read Botul, and that he consequently might have used a [[ghostwriter]] for his book. Responding in an opinion piece, Levy wrote: "It was a truly brilliant and very believable hoax from the mind of a Canard Enchaîné journalist who remains a good philosopher all the same.  So I was caught, as were the critics who reviewed the book when it came out. The only thing left to say, with no hard feelings, is kudos to the artist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carvajal|first=Doreen|title=Philosopher Left to Muse on Ridicule Over a Hoax|work=The New York Times|page=4|date=10 February 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/10/world/europe/10levy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the essay ''Une imposture française'', journalists Nicolas Beau and Olivier Toscer claim that Lévy uses his unique position as an influential member of both the literary and business establishments in France to be the go-between of the two worlds, which helps him to get positive reviews as marks of gratitude, while silencing dissenters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BHL: les dessous d'un système|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/livre/une-imposture-francaise_811125.html|website=L'EXPRESS|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, Beau and Toscer noted that most of the reviews published in France for ''Who Killed Daniel Pearl?'' didn't mention strong denials about the book given by experts and Pearl's own family including wife [[Mariane Pearl]] who called Lévy "a man whose intelligence is destroyed by his own ego".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lévy|first1=Justine|title=Justine Levy, Daughter of French Public Intellectual BHL, Writes What She Knows: Life|url=http://jewishbusinessnews.com/2015/02/27/justine-levy-daughter-of-french-public-intellectual-bhl-writes-what-she-knows-life/|website=Jewishbusinessnews|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Lévy has been married three times. His eldest daughter by his first marriage to Isabelle Doutreluigne, [[Justine Lévy]], is a best-selling novelist. He has a son, Antonin-Balthazar Lévy, by his second wife, Sylvie Bouscasse. He is currently married to French actress and singer [[Arielle Dombasle]]. The close relationship between Lévy and heiress and socialite [[Daphne Guinness]] has become something of an open secret known and acknowledged by most US society columnists since 2008. On 13 July 2010, Daphne Guinness confirmed the whole story in the UK press.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Blasberg, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/12/daphne-guinness-bernardhe_n_822322.html "Daphne Guinness: Bernard-Henri Levy ‘Is Quite Obviously The Love Of My Life’"], ''Huffington Post'', 12 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lévy is proudly [[Jewish]], and he has said that Jews ought to provide a unique Jewish moral voice in society and politics.&lt;ref name=leadel&gt;[http://www.leadel.net/talks/environment-science/bernard-henri-levy environment-science | Leading Jewish Inspiration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307015108/http://www.leadel.net/talks/environment-science/bernard-henri-levy |date=7 March 2009 }}. Leadel. Retrieved 19 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lévy has been friends with [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] since 1983. Relations between them deteriorated during Sarkozy's 2007 presidential run in which Lévy backed the Socialist candidate and also described Sarkozy as "A man with a warrior vision of politics". However, they grew closer again after Sarkozy's victory.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Dickey, [http://www.newsweek.com/why-sarkozy-went-war-66463 "Why Sarkozy Went to War"]. ''Newsweek'' (3 April 2011). Retrieved 19 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his recent book, ''Left in Dark Times'', is devoted to explaining his refusal to support Sarkozy despite agreeing with him on many points, and his insistence on continuing to identify himself as a leftist despite rejecting much of modern leftist thought.

In 2004, his fortune amounts to 150 million euros. Owner of seven companies, its fortune comes essentially from the inheritance of his parents, then completed by stock exchange investments (he is in 2000 suspected of [[insider trading]] by the ''Commission des opérations de bourse'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/un-heritier-devenu-milliardaire-27-10-2004-2005406567.php|title=Un héritier devenu milliardaire|date=26 October 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats==
Lévy was one of six prominent Jewish public figures in Europe targeted for assassination by a Belgium-based [[Islamist]] militant group in 2008. The list included others in France such as [[Josy Eisenberg]]. That plot was reportedly foiled after the group's leader, [[Abdelkader Belliraj]], was arrested based on unrelated murder charges from the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1051943.html "Bernard Henri Levy among 6 Jews said targeted by Islamist group"], ''Haaretz'' (1 January 2009).

'''Biofeedback''' is the process of gaining greater awareness of many [[physiology|physiological]] functions primarily using instruments that provide information on the activity of those same systems, with a goal of being able to manipulate them at will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Durand, Vincent Mark |author2=Barlow, David |title=Abnormal psychology: an integrative approach |publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning |location=Belmont, CA |year=2009 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mo_q4zFVNo4C&amp;pg=PA331 331] |isbn=0-495-09556-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = AAPB&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback]]|title=What is Biofeedback|url=http://www.aapb.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=1|others=(See bottom of page.)|date=18 May 2008|accessdate=2015-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the processes that can be controlled include [[Electroencephalography|brainwaves]], [[muscle tone]], [[skin conductance]], [[heart rate]] and [[pain]] perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=deCharms RC, Maeda F, Glover GH |title=Control over brain activation and pain learned by using real-time functional MRI |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=102 |issue=51 |pages=18626–31 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16352728 |pmc=1311906 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0505210102 |url= |bibcode=2005PNAS..10218626D|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In biofeedback, you are connected to electrical sensors that help you receive information (feedback) about your body (bio).

Biofeedback may be used to improve health, performance, and the physiological changes that often occur in conjunction with changes to thoughts, emotions, and behavior.  Eventually, these changes may be maintained without the use of extra equipment, for no equipment is necessarily required to practice biofeedback.&lt;ref name = AAPB/&gt;

Biofeedback has been found to be effective for the treatment of [[headache]]s and [[migraine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nestoriuc Y, Martin A |title=Efficacy of biofeedback for migraine: a meta-analysis |journal=Pain |volume=128 |issue=1–2 |pages=111–27 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17084028 |doi=10.1016/j.pain.2006.09.007 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nestoriuc Y, Martin A, Rief W, Andrasik F |title=Biofeedback treatment for headache disorders: a comprehensive efficacy review |journal=Appl Psychophysiol Biofeedback |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=125–40 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18726688 |doi=10.1007/s10484-008-9060-3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information coded biofeedback==
'''Information coded biofeedback''' is an evolving form and methodology in the field of biofeedback.  Its uses may be applied in the areas of health, wellness and awareness.  Biofeedback has its modern conventional roots in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Barbara B|title=New mind, new body: Bio-feedback; new directions for the mind|date=January 1, 1975|asin=B0006W86JE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karlins|first1=Marvins|title=Biofeedback|date=January 1, 1973|isbn=978-0446760188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, biofeedback as a discipline and a technology has continued to mature and express new versions of the method with novel interpretations in areas utilizing the [[Electromyography|electromyograph]], electrodermograph, [[electroencephalograph]] and [[electrocardiogram]] among others.
The concept of biofeedback is based on the fact that a wide variety of ongoing intrinsic natural functions of the organism occur at a level of awareness generally called the "unconscious".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  The biofeedback process is designed to interface with select aspects of these "unconscious" processes.

The definition reads:
Biofeedback is a process that enables an individual to learn how to change physiological activity for the purposes of improving health and performance. Precise instruments measure physiological activity such as brainwaves, heart function, breathing, muscle activity, and skin temperature. These instruments rapidly and accurately feed back information to the user. The presentation of this information—often in conjunction with changes in thinking, emotions, and behavior—supports desired physiological changes. Over time, these changes can endure without continued use of an instrument.&lt;ref name="AAPB" /&gt;

A more simple definition could be:
Biofeedback is the process of gaining greater awareness of many physiological functions primarily using instruments that provide information on the activity of those same systems, with a goal of being able to manipulate them at will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Durand |first1=Vincent Mark|last2=Barlow |first2= David|title=Abnormal psychology: an integrative approach|date=2009|location=Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Cengage Learning|isbn=0-495-09556-7|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Emphasis added by author.)

In both of these definitions, a cardinal feature of the concept is the association of the "will" with the result of a new cognitive "learning" skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Barbara B|title=Biological Awareness as a State of Consciousness|journal=Journal of Altered States of Consciousness|date=1975|volume=2|issue=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examine this concept and do not necessarily ascribe it simply to a willful acquisition of a new learned skill but also extend the dynamics into the realms of a behavioristic conditioning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dupuis|first1=Garnet|title=The Unconscious and Its Role in Biofeedback Processes|journal=Center of International Studies|date=November 29, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Leslie H. Sherlinab|author2=Martijn Arns|author3=Joel Lubar|author4=Hartmut Heinrich|author5=Cynthia Kerson|author6=Ute Streh|author7=M. Barry Sterman|last-author-amp=yes |title=Neurofeedback and Basic Learning Theory: Implications for Research and Practice|journal=Journal of Neurotherapy |date=2011|volume=15|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (7).  Behaviorism contends that it is possible to change the actions and functions of an organism by exposing it to a number of conditions or influences.  Key to the concept is not only that the functions are unconscious but that conditioning processes themselves may be unconscious to the organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skinner|first1=B.F.|title=About Behaviorism|date=1974|isbn=0-394-71618-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Information coded biofeedback relies primarily on the behavior conditioning aspect of biofeedback in promoting significant changes in the functioning of the organism.

The principle of "information" is both complex and, in part, controversial. The term itself is derived from the Latin verb informare which means literally "to bring into form or shape".  The meaning of "information" is largely affected by the context of usage.  Probably the simplest and perhaps most insightful definition of "information" was given by Gregory Bateson—"Information is news of change" or another as "the difference that makes a difference".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bateson|first1=Gregory|title=Form, Substance, and Difference, in Steps to an Ecology of Mind|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Information may also be thought of as "any type of pattern that influences the formation or transformation of other patterns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Claude|first1=Shannon|title=The Mathematical Theory of Communication|date=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recognizing the inherent [[complexity]] of an organism, information coded biofeedback applies algorithmic calculations in a [[stochastic]] approach to identify significant probabilities in a limited set of possibilities.

==Sensor modalities==

===Electromyograph===
[[File:Muscle Whistler with EMG surface electrodes (1971).jpg|thumb|The "Muscle Whistler", shown here with surface EMG electrodes, was an early biofeedback device developed by [[Harry Garland]] and [[Roger Melen]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
 | journal = Popular Electronics| title = Build the Muscle Whistler | last1 = Garland | first1 = Harry  | last2 = Melen | first2 = Roger | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = 60–62 | year = 1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whistler"/&gt;]]
An [[electromyograph]] ([[Electromyography|EMG]]) uses surface electrodes to detect muscle action potentials from underlying skeletal muscles that initiate muscle contraction. Clinicians record the surface electromyogram (SEMG) using one or more active electrodes that are placed over a target muscle and a reference electrode that is placed within six inches of either active. The SEMG is measured in [[microvolt]]s (millionths of a volt).&lt;ref&gt;Tassinary, L. G., Cacioppo, J. T., &amp; Vanman, E. J. (2007). The skeletomotor system: Surface electromyography. In J. T. Cacioppo, L. G. Tassinary, &amp; G. G. Berntson, (Eds.). ''Handbook of psychophysiology'' (3rd ed.). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Florimond, V. (2009). ''Basics of surface electromyography applied to physical rehabilitation and biomechanics''. Montreal: Thought Technology Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to surface electrodes, clinicians may also insert wires or needles intramuscularly to record an EMG signal. While this is more painful and often costly, the signal is more reliable since surface electrodes pick up cross talk from nearby muscles.  The use of surface electrodes is also limited to superficial muscles, making the intramuscular approach beneficial to access signals from deeper muscles. The electrical activity picked up by the electrodes is recorded and displayed in the same fashion as the surface electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electromyography (EMG)|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/neurological/electromyography_emg_92,P07656/|work=Johns Hopkins Medicine|accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to placing surface electrodes, the skin is normally shaved, cleaned and exfoliated to get the best signal. Raw EMG signals resemble noise (electrical signal not coming from the muscle of interest) and the voltage fluctuates, therefore they are processed normally in three ways: rectification, filtering, and integration. This processing allows for a unified signal that is then able to be compared to other signals using the same processing techniques.

Biofeedback therapists use EMG biofeedback when treating [[anxiety]] and [[worry]], [[chronic pain]], computer-related disorder, [[essential hypertension]], headache (migraine, mixed headache, and [[tension-type headache]]), [[low back pain]], [[physical rehabilitation]] ([[cerebral palsy]], incomplete spinal cord lesions, and [[stroke]]), [[temporomandibular joint dysfunction]] (TMD), [[torticollis]], and [[fecal incontinence]], [[urinary incontinence]], and [[pelvic pain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Peper | first = E |author2=Gibney KH | year = 2006 | title = Muscle biofeedback at the computer: A manual to prevent repetitive strain injury (RSI) by taking the guesswork out of assessment, monitoring, and training | location = Amersfoort, The Netherlands | publisher = BFE | url = http://www.aapb.org/tl_files/AAPB/files/biof_35_2_biofeedback.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101019023511/http://aapb.org/tl_files/AAPB/files/biof_35_2_biofeedback.pdf | archivedate = 2010-10-19 | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Yucha2008&gt;{{cite book | last = Yucha | first = C |author2=Montgomery D | year = 2008 | title = Evidence-based practice in biofeedback and neurofeedback | location =Wheat Ridge, CO | publisher = AAPB | url = http://www.isnr.org/uploads/EvidenceBasedYuchaMontgomeryW.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101009135554/http://isnr.org/uploads/EvidenceBasedYuchaMontgomeryW.pdf | archivedate = 2010-10-09 | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical therapists have also used EMG biofeedback for evaluating muscle activation and providing feedback for their patients.&lt;ref name="Whistler"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forward|first=Edna|journal=Physical Therapy|title=Patient Evaluation with an Audio Electromyogram Monitor: "The Muscle Whistler"|date=April 1972|volume=52 |issue=4| pages=402–403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feedback thermometer===
A feedback thermometer detects skin temperature with a [[thermistor]] (a temperature-sensitive resistor) that is usually attached to a finger or toe and measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit. Skin temperature mainly reflects [[arteriole]] diameter. Hand-warming and hand-cooling are produced by separate mechanisms, and their regulation involves different skills.&lt;ref name="Andreassi, J. L. 2007"&gt;Andreassi, J. L. (2007). ''Psychophysiology: Human behavior and physiological response'' (5th ed.). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum and Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Hand-warming involves arteriole [[vasodilation]] produced by a beta-2 adrenergic hormonal mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cohen R.

Biofeedback therapists use temperature biofeedback when treating chronic pain, [[edema]], headache (migraine and tension-type headache), essential hypertension, [[Raynaud's phenomenon|Raynaud's disease]], anxiety, and [[Stress (biology)|stress]].&lt;ref name = Yucha2008/&gt;

===Electrodermograph===
An electrodermograph (EDG) measures skin electrical activity directly (skin conductance and skin potential) and indirectly (skin resistance) using electrodes placed over the digits or hand and wrist. Orienting responses to unexpected stimuli, arousal and worry, and cognitive activity can increase [[eccrine]] sweat gland activity, increasing the conductivity of the skin for electric current.&lt;ref name="Andreassi, J. L. 2007"/&gt;
 
In ''skin conductance'', an electrodermograph imposes an imperceptible current across the skin and measures how easily it travels through the skin. When anxiety raises the level of sweat in a sweat duct, conductance increases. Skin conductance is measured in microsiemens (millionths of a [[siemens (unit)|siemens]]). In ''skin potential'', a therapist places an active electrode over an active site (e.g., the palmar surface of the hand) and a reference electrode over a relatively inactive site (e.g., forearm). Skin potential is the voltage that develops between eccrine sweat glands and internal tissues and is measured in millivolts (thousandths of a volt). In ''skin resistance'', also called [[galvanic skin response]] (GSR), an electrodermograph imposes a current across the skin and measures the amount of opposition it encounters. Skin resistance is measured in kΩ (thousands of ohms).&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, M. E., Schell, A. M., &amp; Filion, D. L. (2007). The electrodermal system. In J. T. Cacioppo, L. G. Tassinary, &amp; G. G. Berntson (Eds.). ''Handbook of psychophysiology'' (3rd ed.). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electroencephalograph===
{{More footnotes|section|date= September 2013}}
An [[electroencephalograph]] (EEG) measures the electrical activation of the brain from scalp sites located over the human cortex.  The EEG shows the amplitude of electrical activity at each cortical site, the amplitude and relative power of various wave forms at each site, and the degree to which each cortical site fires in conjunction with other cortical sites (coherence and symmetry).&lt;ref&gt;Kropotov, J. D. (2009). Quantitative EEG, event-related potentials and neurotherapy. San Diego, CA: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EEG uses precious metal electrodes to detect a voltage between at least two electrodes located on the scalp. The EEG records both excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) that largely occur in dendrites in pyramidal cells located in macrocolumns, several millimeters in diameter, in the upper cortical layers. [[Neurofeedback]] monitors both slow and fast cortical potentials.&lt;ref name="Thompson, M. 2003"&gt;Thompson, M., &amp; Thompson, L. (2003). ''The biofeedback book: An introduction to basic concepts in applied psychophysiology.'' Wheat Ridge, CO: Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slow cortical potentials are gradual changes in the membrane potentials of cortical dendrites that last from 300 ms to several seconds. These potentials include the [[contingent negative variation]] (CNV), [[readiness potential]], [[movement-related potentials]] (MRPs), and [[P300 (neuroscience)|P300]] and [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]] potentials.&lt;ref name="Stern, R. M. 2001"&gt;Stern, R. M., Ray, W. J., &amp; Quigley, K. S. (2001). ''Psychophysiological recording'' (2nd ed.). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fast cortical potentials range from 0.5&amp;nbsp;Hz to 100&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;LaVaque, T. J. (2003). Neurofeedback, Neurotherapy, and quantitative EEG. In D. Moss, A. McGrady, T. Davies, &amp; I. Wickramasekera (Eds), ''Handbook of mind-body medicine for primary care'' (pp. 123-136). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; The main frequency ranges include delta, theta, alpha, the sensorimotor rhythm, low beta, high beta, and gamma. The thresholds or boundaries defining the frequency ranges vary considerably among professionals. Fast cortical potentials can be described by their predominant frequencies, but also by whether they are synchronous or asynchronous wave forms. Synchronous wave forms occur at regular periodic intervals, whereas asynchronous wave forms are irregular.&lt;ref name="Thompson, M. 2003"/&gt;

The synchronous [[delta rhythm]] ranges from 0.5 to 3.5&amp;nbsp;Hz. Delta is the dominant frequency from ages 1 to 2, and is associated in adults with deep sleep and brain pathology like trauma and tumors, and learning disability.

The synchronous [[theta rhythm]] ranges from 4 to 7&amp;nbsp;Hz. Theta is the dominant frequency in healthy young children and is associated with drowsiness or starting to sleep, REM sleep, hypnagogic imagery (intense imagery experienced before the onset of sleep), hypnosis, attention, and processing of cognitive and perceptual information.

The synchronous [[alpha rhythm]] ranges from 8 to 13&amp;nbsp;Hz and is defined by its waveform and not by its frequency. Alpha activity can be observed in about 75% of awake, relaxed individuals and is replaced by low-amplitude desynchronized beta activity during movement, complex problem-solving, and visual focusing. This phenomenon is called alpha blocking.

The synchronous [[sensorimotor rhythm]] (SMR) ranges from 12 to 15&amp;nbsp;Hz and is located over the sensorimotor cortex (central sulcus). The sensorimotor rhythm is associated with the inhibition of movement and reduced muscle tone.

The [[beta rhythm]] consists of asynchronous waves and can be divided into low beta and high beta ranges (13–21&amp;nbsp;Hz and 20–32&amp;nbsp;Hz). Low beta is associated with activation and focused thinking. High beta is associated with anxiety, [[hypervigilance]], [[panic]], peak performance, and [[worry]].

EEG activity from 36 to 44&amp;nbsp;Hz is also referred to as gamma. Gamma activity is associated with perception of meaning and meditative awareness.&lt;ref name="Thompson, M. 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steriade, M. (2005). Cellular substrates of brain rhythms. In E.

Neurotherapists use EEG biofeedback when treating [[Substance use disorder|addiction]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[learning disability]], anxiety disorders (including [[worry]], [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] and posttraumatic stress disorder), [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], migraine, and [[generalized seizures]].&lt;ref name = Yucha2008/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.

===Photoplethysmograph===
[[File:EmWave2, powering up.jpg|thumb|180px|upright|An ''emWave2'' photoplethysmograph for monitoring heart rate variability]]

[[File:Photoplethysmograph - Biofeedback HRV with ear sensor.jpg|thumb|180px|upright| ''Stone'' computer-based photoplethysmograph with ear sensor]]

A [[photoplethysmograph]] (PPG) measures the relative blood flow through a digit using a photoplethysmographic (PPG) sensor attached by a Velcro band to the fingers or to the temple to monitor the [[Superficial temporal artery|temporal artery]]. An infrared light source is transmitted through or reflected off the tissue, detected by a phototransistor, and quantified in arbitrary units. Less light is absorbed when blood flow is greater, increasing the intensity of light reaching the sensor.&lt;ref name="Combatalade, D. 2009"&gt;Combatalade, D. (2009). ''Basics of heart rate variability applied to psychophysiology''. Montreal, Canada: Thought Technology Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

A photoplethysmograph can measure blood volume pulse (BVP), which is the phasic change in blood volume with each heartbeat, heart rate, and [[heart rate variability]] (HRV), which consists of beat-to-beat differences in intervals between successive heartbeats.&lt;ref name="Lehrer, P. M. 2007 P. M"&gt;Lehrer, P. M. (2007). Biofeedback training to increase heart rate variability. In P. M. Lehrer, R. M. Woolfolk, &amp; W. E. Sime (Eds.). ''Principles and practice of stress management'' (3rd ed.). New York: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Peper E. |author2=Harvey R. |author3=Lin I. |author4=Tylova H. |author5=Moss D. | year = 2007 | title = Is there more to blood volume pulse than heart rate variability, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and cardio-respiratory synchrony? | url = | journal = Biofeedback | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 54–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A photoplethysmograph can provide useful feedback when temperature feedback shows minimal change. This is because the PPG sensor is more sensitive than a thermistor to minute blood flow changes.&lt;ref name="Shaffer" /&gt;  Biofeedback therapists can use a photoplethysmograph to supplement temperature biofeedback when treating chronic pain, edema, headache (migraine and tension-type headache), essential hypertension, Raynaud's disease, anxiety, and stress.&lt;ref name = Yucha2008/&gt;

===Electrocardiogram===
The [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) uses electrodes placed on the torso, wrists, or legs, to measure the electrical activity of the heart and measures the [[interbeat interval]] (distances between successive [[R-wave]] peaks in the [[QRS complex]]). The interbeat interval, divided into 60 seconds, determines the heart rate at that moment. The statistical variability of that interbeat interval is what we call heart rate variability.&lt;ref&gt;Berntson, G. G., Quigley, K. S., &amp; Lozano, D. (2007). Cardiovascular psychophysiology. In J. T. Cacioppo, L. G. Tassinary, &amp; G. G. Berntson, (Eds.). ''Handbook of psychophysiology'' (3rd ed.).

HRV data from both polyplethysmographs and electrocardiograms are analyzed via mathematical transformations such as the commonly-used [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The FFT splits the HRV data into a [[Spectral density|power spectrum]], revealing the waveform's constituent frequencies.&lt;ref name="Combatalade, D. 2009" /&gt; Among those constituent frequencies, high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) components are defined as above and below .15&amp;nbsp;Hz, respectively. As a rule of thumb, the LF component of HRV represents sympathetic activity, and the HF component represents parasympathetic activity. The two main components are often represented as a LF/HF ratio and used to express sympathovagal balance.&lt;ref name="Combatalade, D. 2009" /&gt; Some researchers consider a third, medium-frequency (MF) component from .08&amp;nbsp;Hz to .15&amp;nbsp;Hz, which has been shown to increase in power during times of appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCraty|first=Rollin|last2=Atkinson|first2=Mike|last3=Tiller|first3=William A.|last4=Rein|first4=Glen|last5=Watkins|first5=Alan D.|title=The effects of emotions on short-term power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002914999803099|journal=The American Journal of Cardiology|volume=76|issue=14|pages=1089–1093|doi=10.1016/s0002-9149(99)80309-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pneumograph===
A [[pneumograph]] or respiratory strain gauge uses a flexible sensor band that is placed around the chest, abdomen, or both. The strain gauge method can provide feedback about the relative expansion/contraction of the chest and abdomen, and can measure [[respiration rate]] (the number of breaths per minute).&lt;ref name="Stern, R. M. 2001"/&gt; Clinicians can use a pneumograph to detect and correct dysfunctional breathing patterns and behaviors. Dysfunctional breathing patterns include [[clavicular breathing]] (breathing that primarily relies on the [[external intercostals]] and the [[accessory muscles of respiration]] to inflate the lungs), [[reverse breathing]] (breathing where the abdomen expands during exhalation and contracts during inhalation), and [[thoracic breathing]] (shallow breathing that primarily relies on the external intercostals to inflate the lungs). Dysfunctional breathing behaviors include [[apnea]] (suspension of breathing), gasping, sighing, and wheezing.&lt;ref name="Peper, E. 2008"&gt;Peper, E., Tylova, H., Gibney, K. H., Harvey, R., &amp; Combatalade, D. (2008). ''Biofeedback mastery: An experiential teaching and self-training manual''. Wheat Ridge, CO: Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback.&lt;/ref&gt;

A pneumograph is often used in conjunction with an [[electrocardiograph]] (ECG) or photoplethysmograph (PPG) in heart rate variability (HRV) training.&lt;ref name="Lehrer, P. M. 2007 P. M"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lehrer P.

Biofeedback therapists use pneumograph biofeedback with patients diagnosed with anxiety disorders, asthma, chronic pulmonary obstructive disorder (COPD), essential hypertension, [[panic attacks]], and stress.&lt;ref name = Yucha2008/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fried, R. 1987"&gt;Fried, R. (1987). ''The hyperventilation syndrome: Research and clinical treatment''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capnometer===
A [[capnometer]] or [[capnograph]] uses an infrared detector to measure end-tidal {{chem|CO|2}} (the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in expired air at the end of expiration) exhaled through the nostril into a latex tube. The average value of end-tidal {{chem|CO|2}} for a resting adult is 5% ({{convert|36|torr|kPa|abbr=on|disp=or}}). A capnometer is a sensitive index of the quality of patient breathing. Shallow, rapid, and effortful breathing lowers {{chem|CO|2}}, while deep, slow, effortless breathing increases it.&lt;ref name="Peper, E. 2008"/&gt;

Biofeedback therapists use capnometric biofeedback to supplement respiratory strain gauge biofeedback with patients diagnosed with anxiety disorders, asthma, chronic pulmonary obstructive disorder (COPD), essential hypertension, panic attacks, and stress.&lt;ref name = Yucha2008/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fried, R. 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fried, R. (1993). ''The psychology and physiology of breathing''. New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rheoencephalograph===

[[Rheoencephalography]] (REG), or brain blood flow biofeedback, is a biofeedback technique of a conscious control of blood flow. An electronic device called a [[rheoencephalograph]] [from Greek rheos stream, anything flowing, from rhein to flow] is utilized in brain blood flow biofeedback. Electrodes are attached to the skin at certain points on the head and permit the device to measure continuously the electrical conductivity of the tissues of structures located between the electrodes. The brain blood flow technique is based on non-invasive method of measuring bio-impedance. Changes in bio-impedance are generated by blood volume and blood flow and registered by a rheographic device.&lt;ref&gt;Tokarev V.E. "A Rheoencephalogram (REG) Variability System Based on ISKRA-226 Personal Computer", Institute for Complex Problem of Hygiene Healthcare Conference, Novokuznetsk, Russia, 1989, p.115-116.&lt;/ref&gt; The pulsative bio-impedance changes directly reflect the total blood flow of the deep structures of brain due to high frequency impedance measurements.&lt;ref&gt;Tokarev V.E. "Regulatory Mechanisms of Physiological Systems During REG Biofeedback", 25th Annual Meeting of Association of Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback, Atlanta, USA, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hemoencephalography===
[[Hemoencephalography]] or HEG biofeedback is a functional [[infrared]] imaging technique. As its name describes, it measures the differences in the color of light reflected back through the scalp based on the relative amount of oxygenated and unoxygenated blood in the brain. Research continues to determine its reliability, validity, and clinical applicability. HEG is used to treat [[ADHD]] and migraine, and for research.&lt;ref&gt;Toomim, H., &amp; Carmen, J. (2009).

=== Pressure ===
Pressure can be monitored as a patient performs exercises while resting against an air-filled cushion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportstek.net/pressure_biofeedback.htm Chattanooga Stabilizer Pressure Biofeeedback]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is pertinent to [[physiotherapy]]. Alternatively, the patient may actively grip or press against an air-filled cushion of custom shape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pressureairbiofeedback.com/index.html pab®, Pressure Air Biofeedback]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Urinary incontinence===
Mowrer detailed the use of a bedwetting alarm that sounds when children urinate while asleep. This simple biofeedback device can quickly teach children to wake up when their bladders are full and to contract the urinary sphincter and relax the detrusor muscle, preventing further urine release. Through classical conditioning, sensory feedback from a full bladder replaces the alarm and allows children to continue sleeping without urinating.&lt;ref&gt;Mowrer, O. H. (1960). ''Learning theory and behavior''. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arnold Kegel|Kegel]] developed the perineometer in 1947 to treat urinary incontinence (urine leakage) in women whose pelvic floor muscles are weakened during pregnancy and childbirth. The perineometer, which is inserted into the vagina to monitor pelvic floor muscle contraction, satisfies all the requirements of a biofeedback device and enhances the effectiveness of popular Kegel exercises.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, J. D., &amp; Talcott, L. B. (1989). The Kegel Perineometer: Biofeedback Twenty Years Before Its Time. A "Special Historical Paper." ''Proceedings of the 20th Annual Meeting of the Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback'', San Diego, CA, 169-172.&lt;/ref&gt; Contradicting this, a 2013 [[randomized controlled trial]] found no benefit of adding biofeedback to pelvic floor muscle exercise in [[stress urinary incontinence]].&lt;ref name="HirakawaT2013Randomized"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hirakawa|first=T|author2=Suzuki, S |author3=Kato, K |author4=Gotoh, M |author5= Yoshikawa, Y |title=Randomized controlled trial of pelvic floor muscle training with or without biofeedback for urinary incontinence|journal=Int.

Research has shown that biofeedback can improve the efficacy of [[pelvic floor exercise]]s and help restore proper bladder functions. The mode of action of [[vaginal cones]], for instance involves a biological biofeedback mechanism. Studies have shown that biofeedback obtained with vaginal cones is as effective as biofeedback induced through physiotherapy electrostimulation.&lt;ref&gt;3Olah et al., The conservative management of patients with symptoms of stress incontinence: a randomized, prospective study comparing weighted vaginal cones and interferential therapy" ''Am J Obstet Gynecol''1990 Jan;162(1) 87-92&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research recommended biofeedback as a first-line treatment for adult urinary incontinence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Busby-Whitehead |author2=Johnson T. |author3=Clarke M.

===Fecal incontinence and anismus===
Biofeedback is a major treatment for [[anismus]] (paradoxical contraction of puborectalis during defecation). This therapy directly evolved from the investigation [[anorectal manometry]] where a probe that can record pressure is placed in the anal canal. Biofeedback therapy is also a commonly used and researched therapy for fecal incontinence, but the benefits are uncertain.&lt;ref name="Norton 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norton|first=C|author2=Cody, JD|title=Biofeedback and/or sphincter exercises for the treatment of faecal incontinence in adults.|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Jul 11, 2012|volume=7|pages=CD002111|pmid=22786479|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002111.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biofeedback therapy varies in the way it is delivered. It is also unknown if one type has benefits over another.&lt;ref name="Norton 2012" /&gt; The aims have been described as to enhance either the rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR), rectal sensitivity (by discrimination of progressively smaller volumes of a rectal balloon and promptly contracting the [[external anal sphincter]] (EAS)), or the strength and endurance of the EAS contraction. Three general types of biofeedback have been described, though they are not mutually exclusive, with many protocols combining these elements.&lt;ref name="Norton 2012" /&gt; Similarly there is variance of the length of both the individual sessions and the overall length of the training, and if home exercises are performed in addition and how. In rectal sensitivity training, a balloon is placed in the rectum, and is gradually distended until there is a sensation of rectal filling. Successively smaller volume reinflations of the balloon aim to help the person detect rectal distension at a lower threshold, giving more time to contract the EAS and prevent incontinence, or to journey to the toilet. Alternatively, in those with urge incontinence/ rectal hypersensitivity, training is aimed at teaching the person to tolerate progressively larger volumes. Strength training may involve electromyography (EMG) skin electrodes, manometric pressures, intra-anal EMG, or [[endoanal ultrasound]]. One of these measures are used to relay the muscular activity or anal canal pressure during anal sphincter exercise. Performance and progress can be monitored in this manner. Co-ordination training involves the placing of 3 balloons, in the rectum and in the upper and lower anal canal. The rectal balloon is inflated to trigger the RAIR, an event often followed by incontinence. Co-ordination training aims to teach voluntary contraction of EAS when the RAIR occurs (i.e. when there is rectal distension).&lt;ref name="Norton 2012" /&gt;

===EEG===
{{Main|Electroencephalography|Neurofeedback}}
[[Richard Caton|Caton]] recorded spontaneous electrical potentials from the exposed cortical surface of monkeys and rabbits, and was the first to measure event-related potentials (EEG responses to stimuli) in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Caton R | year = 1875 | title = The electric currents of the brain | url = | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 2 | issue = | page = 278 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikolay Danilevsky|Danilevsky]] published ''Investigations in the Physiology of the Brain'', which explored the relationship between the EEG and states of consciousness in 1877.&lt;ref name="Brazier, M.

[[Adolf Beck (physiologist)|Beck]] published studies of spontaneous electrical potentials detected from the brains of dogs and rabbits, and was the first to document alpha blocking, where light alters rhythmic oscillations, in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Coenen A.

[[Vladimir Pravdich-Neminsky|Pravdich-Neminsky]] photographed the EEG and event related potentials from dogs, demonstrated a 12–14&amp;nbsp;Hz rhythm that slowed during asphyxiation, and introduced the term electrocerebrogram in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pravdich-Neminsky V.

[[Alexander Forbes (physiologist)|Forbes]] reported the replacement of the string galvanometer with a vacuum tube to amplify the EEG in 1920. The vacuum tube became the de facto standard by 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Forbes A. |author2=Mann D.

[[Hans Berger|Berger]] (1924) published the first human EEG data. He recorded electrical potentials from his son Klaus's scalp. At first he believed that he had discovered the physical mechanism for telepathy but was disappointed that the electromagnetic variations disappear only millimeters away from the skull. (He did continue to believe in telepathy throughout his life, however, having had a particularly confirming event regarding his sister). He viewed the EEG as analogous to the ECG and introduced the term ''elektenkephalogram''. He believed that the EEG had diagnostic and therapeutic promise in measuring the impact of clinical interventions. Berger showed that these potentials were not due to scalp muscle contractions. He first identified the alpha rhythm, which he called the Berger rhythm, and later identified the beta rhythm and [[sleep spindles]]. He demonstrated that alterations in consciousness are associated with changes in the EEG and associated the beta rhythm with alertness. He described interictal activity (EEG potentials between seizures) and recorded a partial complex seizure in 1933. Finally, he performed the first QEEG, which is the measurement of the signal strength of EEG frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Berger H | year = 1920 | title = Ueber das elektroenkephalogramm des menschen | url = | journal = Archiv für Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten | volume = 87 | issue = | pages = 527–570 | doi = 10.1007/BF01797193 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edgar Adrian, 1st Baron Adrian|Adrian]] and [[Bryan Harold Cabot Matthews|Matthews]] confirmed Berger's findings in 1934 by recording their own EEGs using a cathode-ray oscilloscope. Their demonstration of EEG recording at the 1935 Physiological Society meetings in England caused its widespread acceptance. Adrian used himself as a subject and demonstrated the phenomenon of alpha blocking, where opening his eyes suppressed alpha rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Adrian E. D. |author2=Mathews B.

[[Frederic A. Gibbs|Gibbs]], [[Hallowell Davis|Davis]], and [[William Gordon Lennox|Lennox]] inaugurated clinical electroencephalography in 1935 by identifying abnormal EEG rhythms associated with epilepsy, including [[interictal]] spike waves and 3&amp;nbsp;Hz activity in [[absence seizures]].&lt;ref name="Brazier, M. A. B. 1959"/&gt;

[[Frédéric Bremer|Bremer]] used the EEG to show how sensory signals affect vigilance in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bremer F | year = 1935 | title = Cerveau isole et physiologie du sommeil | url = | journal = Com. Ren. Soc. Bio. | volume = 118 | issue = | pages = 1235–1241 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Grey Walter|Walter]] (1937, 1953) named the [[delta waves]] and [[theta waves]], and the contingent negative variation (CNV), a slow cortical potential that may reflect expectancy, motivation, intention to act, or attention. He located an [[occipital lobe]] source for alpha waves and demonstrated that delta waves can help locate brain lesions like tumors. He improved Berger's electroencephalograph and pioneered EEG topography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bladin P. F. | year = 2006 | title = W.

Kleitman has been recognized as the "Father of American sleep research" for his seminal work in the regulation of sleep-wake cycles, [[circadian rhythms]], the sleep patterns of different age groups, and the effects of [[sleep deprivation]]. He discovered the phenomenon of [[rapid eye movement sleep|rapid eye movement]] (REM) sleep with his graduate student Aserinsky in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kleitman N | year = 1960 | title = Patterns of dreaming | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 203 | issue = 5| pages = 82–88 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican1160-82 | bibcode = 1960SciAm.203e..82K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dement, another of Kleitman's students, described the EEG architecture and phenomenology of sleep stages and the transitions between them in 1955, associated REM sleep with dreaming in 1957, and documented sleep cycles in another species, cats, in 1958, which stimulated basic sleep research. He established the Stanford University Sleep Research Center in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Dement, W. (2000).

Andersen and Andersson (1968) proposed that thalamic pacemakers project synchronous alpha rhythms to the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] via thalamocortical circuits.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, P., &amp; Andersson, S. (1968). ''A physiological basis of the alpha rhythm''. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kamiya (1968) demonstrated that the alpha rhythm in humans could be [[operant]]ly conditioned. He published an influential article in ''Psychology Today'' that summarized research that showed that subjects could learn to discriminate when alpha was present or absent, and that they could use feedback to shift the dominant alpha frequency about 1&amp;nbsp;Hz. Almost half of his subjects reported experiencing a pleasant "alpha state" characterized as an "alert calmness." These reports may have contributed to the perception of alpha biofeedback as a shortcut to a meditative state. He also studied the EEG correlates of meditative states.&lt;ref&gt;Kamiya, J. (1969). [[Operant]] control of the EEG alpha rhythm. In C. Tart (Ed.), ''Altered states of consciousness''. NY: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown (1970) demonstrated the clinical use of alpha-theta biofeedback. In research designed to identify the subjective states associated with EEG rhythms, she trained subjects to increase the abundance of alpha, beta, and theta activity using visual feedback and recorded their subjective experiences when the amplitude of these frequency bands increased. She also helped popularize biofeedback by publishing a series of books, including ''New Mind, New body'' (1974) and ''Stress and the Art of Biofeedback'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, B. (1974). ''New mind, new body''. New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, B. (1977). ''Stress and the art of biofeedback''. New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, B. (1980). ''Supermind: The ultimate energy''. New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mulholland and Peper (1971) showed that occipital alpha increases with eyes open and not focused, and is disrupted by visual focusing; a rediscovery of alpha blocking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mulholland T. |author2=Peper E. | year = 1971 | title = Occipital alpha and accommodative vergence, pursuit tracking, and fast eye movements | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 8 | issue = 5| pages = 556–575 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8986.1971.tb00491.x | pmid = 5116820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green and Green (1986) investigated voluntary control of internal states by individuals like Swami Rama and American Indian medicine man Rolling Thunder both in India and at the [[Menninger Foundation]]. They brought portable biofeedback equipment to India and monitored practitioners as they demonstrated self-regulation. A film containing footage from their investigations was released as ''Biofeedback: The Yoga of the West'' (1974). They developed alpha-theta training at the Menninger Foundation from the 1960s to the 1990s. They hypothesized that theta states allow access to unconscious memories and increase the impact of prepared images or suggestions.

Sterman (1972) showed that cats and human subjects could be operantly trained to increase the amplitude of the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) recorded from the sensorimotor cortex. He demonstrated that SMR production protects cats against drug-induced generalized seizures (tonic-clonic seizures involving loss of consciousness) and reduces the frequency of seizures in humans diagnosed with [[epilepsy]]. He found that his SMR protocol, which uses visual and auditory EEG biofeedback, normalizes their EEGs (SMR increases while theta and beta decrease toward normal values) even during sleep. Sterman also co-developed the Sterman-Kaiser (SKIL) QEEG database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sterman M.

Birbaumer and colleagues (1981) have studied feedback of slow cortical potentials since the late 1970s. They have demonstrated that subjects can learn to control these DC potentials and have studied the efficacy of slow cortical potential biofeedback in treating ADHD, epilepsy, migraine, and schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Birbaumer N. |author2=Elbert T. |author3=Lutzenberger W. |author4=Rockstroh B. |author5=Schwarz J. | year = 1981 | title = EEG and slow cortical potentials in anticipation of mental tasks with different hemispheric involvement | url = | journal = Biol Psychol | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 251–260 | doi = 10.1016/0301-0511(81)90040-5 | pmid = 7342994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lubar (1989) studied SMR biofeedback to treat attention disorders and epilepsy in collaboration with Sterman. He demonstrated that SMR training can improve attention and academic performance in children diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity (ADHD). He documented the importance of theta-to-beta ratios in ADHD and developed theta suppression-beta enhancement protocols to decrease these ratios and improve student performance.&lt;ref&gt;Lubar, J.

This move has been caused by the general change in the population norms in the past 20 years (most likely due to the change in the average amount of sleep in young people).{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Feré demonstrated the exosomatic method of recording of skin electrical activity by passing a small current through the skin in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Feré, C., Note sur les modifications de la tension e1ectrique dans le corps human, ''Compt. rend. Soc. biol.'', 5  23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarchanoff used the endosomatic method by recording the difference in skin electrical potential from points on the skin surface in 1889; no external current was applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tarchanoff J | year = 1890 | title = Uber die galvanischen Erscheinungen an der Haut des Menschen bei Relzung der Sinnesorgane und bei verschiedenen Formen der psychischen Tatigkeit | url = | journal = Arch.

Marjorie and [[Neurofeedback|Hershel Toomim]] (1975) published a landmark article about the use of GSR biofeedback in psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="Toomim, M. 1975"/&gt;

===Musculoskeletal system===
[[Edmund Jacobson|Jacobson]] (1930) developed hardware to measure EMG voltages over time, showed that cognitive activity (like imagery) affects EMG levels, introduced the deep relaxation method [[Progressive muscle relaxation|Progressive Relaxation]], and wrote ''Progressive Relaxation'' (1929) and ''You Must Relax'' (1934). He prescribed daily Progressive Relaxation practice to treat diverse psychophysiological disorders like hypertension.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, E. (1938). ''Progressive relaxation''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several researchers showed that human subjects could learn precise control of individual motor units (motor neurons and the muscle fibers they control). [[Lindsley]] (1935) found that relaxed subjects could suppress motor unit firing without biofeedback training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lindsley D. B. | year = 1935 | title = Characteristics of single motor unit responses in human muscle during various degrees of contraction | url = | journal = American Journal of Physiology | volume = 113 | issue = | pages = 88–89 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison and Mortensen (1962) trained subjects using visual and auditory EMG biofeedback to control individual motor units in the tibialis anterior muscle of the leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Harrison V.

Basmajian (1963) instructed subjects using unfiltered auditory EMG biofeedback to control separate motor units in the abductor pollicis muscle of the thumb in his Single Motor Unit Training (SMUT) studies. His best subjects coordinated several motor units to produce drum rolls. Basmajian demonstrated practical applications for neuromuscular rehabilitation, [[pain management]], and headache treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Basmajian, J. V. (1967). ''Muscles alive: Their functions revealed by electromyography''. Baltimore: Williams and Wilkins.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marinacci (1960) applied EMG biofeedback to neuromuscular disorders (where [[proprioception]] is disrupted) including Bell Palsy (one-sided facial paralysis), [[polio]], and stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marinacci A.

Value of the electromyogram in differential diagnosis | url = | journal = Bulletin of the Los Angeles Neurological Society | volume = 25 | issue = | page = 18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"While Marinacci used EMG to treat neuromuscular disorders, his colleagues used the EMG only for diagnosis. They were unable to recognize its potential as a teaching tool even when the evidence stared them in the face! Many electromyographers who performed nerve conduction studies used visual and auditory feedback to reduce interference when a patient recruited too many motor units. Even though they used EMG biofeedback to guide the patient to relax so that clean diagnostic EMG tests could be recorded, they were unable to envision EMG biofeedback treatment of motor disorders."&lt;ref&gt;Peper, E., &amp; Shaffer, F. (in press). Biofeedback history: An alternative view. ''Biofeedback''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatmore and Kohli (1968) introduced the concept of dysponesis (misplaced effort) to explain how functional disorders (where body activity is disturbed) develop. Bracing your shoulders when you hear a loud sound illustrates dysponesis, since this action does not protect against injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Whatmore G. |author2=Kohli D. | year = 1968 | title = Dysponesis: A neuropsychologic factor in functional disorders | url = | journal = Behavioral Science | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 102–124 | doi = 10.1002/bs.3830130203 | pmid = 4231964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These clinicians applied EMG biofeedback to diverse functional problems like headache and hypertension. They reported case follow-ups ranging from 6 to 21 years. This was long compared with typical 0-24 month follow-ups in the clinical literature. Their data showed that skill in controlling misplaced efforts was positively related to clinical improvement. Last, they wrote ''The Pathophysiology and Treatment of Functional Disorders'' (1974) that outlined their treatment of functional disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Whatmore, G., &amp; Kohli, D. (1974).

===Cardiovascular system===
Shearn (1962) operantly trained human subjects to increase their heart rates by 5 beats-per-minute to avoid electric shock.&lt;ref name="Shearn 1962"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shearn D. W. | year = 1962 | title = Operant conditioning of heart rate | url = | journal = Science | volume = 137 | issue = 3529| pages = 530–531 | doi = 10.1126/science.137.3529.530 | pmid = 13911531 |bibcode = 1962Sci...137..530S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Shearn's slight heart rate increases, [[Swami Rama]] used yoga to produce atrial flutter at an average 306 beats per minute before a Menninger Foundation audience. This briefly stopped his heart's pumping of blood and silenced his pulse.&lt;ref name="Green, E. 1977"/&gt;

Engel and Chism (1967) operantly trained subjects to decrease, increase, and then decrease their heart rates (this was analogous to ON-OFF-ON EEG training). He then used this approach to teach patients to control their rate of [[premature ventricular contractions]] (PVCs), where the ventricles contract too soon. Engel conceptualized this training protocol as illness onset training, since patients were taught to produce and then suppress a symptom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Engel B. T. |author2=Chism R. A. | year = 1967 | title = Operant conditioning of heart rate speeding | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 418–426 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8986.1967.tb02728.x | pmid = 6041674 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peper has similarly taught asthmatics who wheeze to better control their breathing.&lt;ref&gt;E. Peper, S. Ancoli, &amp; M. Quinn (Eds.). (1979). ''Mind/Body integration: Essential readings in biofeedback''. New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwartz (1971, 1972) examined whether specific patterns of cardiovascular activity are easier to learn than others due to biological constraints. He examined the constraints on learning integrated (two autonomic responses change in the same direction) and differentiated (two autonomic responses change inversely) patterns of [[blood pressure]] and heart rate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schwartz G. E. | year = 1971 | title = Learned control of cardiovascular integration in man | url = | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 33 | issue = 1| pages = 57–62 | pmid = 5100734 | last2 = Shapiro | first2 = D | last3 = Tursky | first3 = B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schultz and Luthe (1969) developed [[Autogenic Training]], which is a deep relaxation exercise derived from hypnosis. This procedure combines passive volition with imagery in a series of three treatment procedures (standard Autogenic exercises, Autogenic neutralization, and Autogenic meditation). Clinicians at the Menninger Foundation coupled an abbreviated list of standard exercises with thermal biofeedback to create autogenic biofeedback.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, J. H., &amp; Luthe, W. (1969). ''Autogenic therapy: Autogenic methods.'' New York: Grune &amp; Stratton.&lt;/ref&gt; Luthe (1973) also published a series of six volumes titled ''Autogenic therapy''.&lt;ref&gt;Luthe, W. (1973). ''Autogenic therapy: Treatment with autogenic neutralization''. New York: Grune &amp; Stratton.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fahrion and colleagues (1986) reported on an 18-26 session treatment program for hypertensive patients. The Menninger
program combined breathing modification, autogenic biofeedback for the hands and feet, and frontal EMG training. The authors reported that 89% of their medication patients discontinued or reduced medication by one-half while significantly lowering blood pressure. While this study did not include a double-blind control, the outcome rate was impressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fahrion S. |author2=Norris P. |author3=Green A. |author4=Green E. | year = 1986 | title = Biobehavioral treatment of essential hypertension: A group outcome study | url = | journal = Biofeedback-and-Self-Regulation | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 257–277 | doi = 10.1007/BF01000163 | pmid = 3607093 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedman and colleagues (1991) demonstrated that hand-warming and hand-cooling are produced by different mechanisms. The primary hand-warming mechanism is [[beta-adrenergic]] (hormonal), while the main hand-cooling mechanism is alpha-adrenergic and involves sympathetic C-fibers. This contradicts the traditional view that finger blood flow is controlled exclusively by sympathetic C-fibers. The traditional model asserts that, when firing is slow, hands warm; when firing is rapid, hands cool. Freedman and colleagues' studies support the view that hand-warming and hand-cooling represent entirely different skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Freedman R.

The opposite happens when blood pressure goes down. Because it takes about 5 seconds for blood pressure to change after changes in heart rate (think of different amounts of blood flowing through the same sized tube), the baroreflex produces a rhythm in heart rate with a period of about 10 seconds. Another rhythm in heart rate is caused by respiration (respiratory sinus arrhythmia), such that heart rate rises during inhalation and falls during exhalation. During HRV biofeedback, these two reflexes stimulate each other, stimulating resonance properties of the cardiovascular system caused by the inherent rhythm in the baroreflex,&lt;ref&gt;Vaschillo, E., Vaschillo, B., Lehrer, P. : 'Characteristics of Resonance in Heart Rate Variability Stimulated by Biofeedback': Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback, 31, 129-142: 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and thus causing very big oscillations in heart rate and large-amplitude stimulation of the baroreflex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lehrer P., Vaschillo E., Vaschillo B., Lu S.E., Eckberg D.L., Edelberg R., Shih W.J., Lin Y., Kuusela T.A., Tahvanainen K.U.O., Hamer R. | year = 2003 | title = Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback Increases Baroreflex Gain and Peak Expiratory Flow | url = | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 65 | issue = | pages = 796–805 | doi=10.1097/01.psy.0000089200.81962.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus HRV biofeedback exercises the baroreflex, and strengthens it. This apparently has the effect of modulating autonomic reactivity to stimulation. Because the baroreflex is controlled through brain stem mechanisms that communicate directly with the insula and amygdala, which control emotion, HRV biofeedback also appears to modulate emotional reactivity, and to help people suffering from anxiety, stress, and depression&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Karavidas M.K. |author2=Lehrer P. |author3=Vaschillo E. |author4=Vaschillo B. |author5=Marin H. |author6=Buyske S. |author7=Radvanski D. |author8=Hassett A. | year = 2007 | title = Preliminary results of an open label study of heart rate variability for the treatment of major depression | url = | journal = Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 19–30 | doi=10.1007/s10484-006-9029-z | pmid=17333315}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zucker T.L. |author2=Samuelson K.W. |author3=Muench F. |author4=Greenberg M.A. |author5=Gevirtz R.N. | year = 2009 | title = The effects of respiratory sinus arrhythmia biofeedback on heart rate variability and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms: a pilot study | url = | journal = Appl.

Because emotions have such an impact on cardiac function, which cascades to numerous other biological processes, emotional regulation techniques are able to effect practical, psychophysiological change.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;
McCraty et al. discovered that feelings of gratitude increased HRV and moved its power spectrum toward the MF (mid-frequency) and HF (high-frequency) ranges, while decreasing LF (low-frequency) power.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;
The Heartmath Institute's patented techniques involve engendering feelings of gratitude and happiness, focusing on the physical location of the heart, and breathing in 10-second cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tiller|first1=William|last2=McCraty|first2=Rollin|last3=Atkinson|first3=Mike|title=Cardiac Coherence: A New, Noninvasive Measure of Autonomic Nervous System Order|journal=Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine|date=January 1996|volume=2|issue=1|pages=52–65|url=http://www.heartmathbenelux.com/doc/Cardiaccoherence.pdf|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pain===

====Chronic back pain====
Newton-John, Spense, and Schotte (1994) compared the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) and Electromyographic Biofeedback (EMG-Biofeedback) for 44 participants with chronic low back pain. Newton-John et al. (1994) split the participants into two groups, then measured the intensity of pain, the participants' perceived disability, and depression before treatment, after treatment and again six months later. Newton-John et al.(1994) found no significant differences between the group which received CBT and the group which received EMG-Biofeedback. This seems to indicate that biofeedback is as effective as CBT in chronic low back pain. Comparing the results of the groups before treatment and after treatment, indicates that EMG-Biofeedback reduced pain, disability, and depression as much as by half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Newton-John T.

====Muscle pain====
Budzynski and Stoyva (1969) showed that EMG biofeedback could reduce [[frontalis muscle|frontalis]] muscle (forehead) contraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Budzynski T. H. |author2=Stoyva J.

McNulty, Gevirtz, Hubbard, and Berkoff (1994) proposed that [[sympathetic nervous system]] innervation of [[muscle spindles]] underlies [[trigger points]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McNulty W.

====Tension headache====
Budzynski, Stoyva, Adler, and Mullaney (1973) reported that auditory frontalis EMG biofeedback combined with home relaxation practice lowered tension headache frequency and frontalis EMG levels. A control group that received noncontingent (false) auditory feedback did not improve. This study helped make the frontalis muscle the placement-of-choice in EMG assessment and treatment of headache and other psychophysiological disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Budzynski, T. H., Stoyva, J. M., Adler, C. S., &amp; Mullaney, D. EMG biofeedback and tension headache: A controlled-outcome study. ''Psychosomatic Medicine'', 35,  484-496.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Migraine====
Sargent, Green, and Walters (1972, 1973) demonstrated that hand-warming could abort migraines and that autogenic biofeedback training could reduce headache activity. The early Menninger migraine studies, although methodologically weak (no pretreatment baselines, control groups, or random assignment to conditions), strongly influenced migraine treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sargent J.

====Phantom-limb pain====
Flor (2002) trained amputees to detect the location and frequency of shocks delivered to their stumps, which resulted in an expansion of corresponding cortical regions and significant reduction of their phantom limb pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Flor H | year = 2002 | title = Phantom-limb pain: characteristics, causes, and treatment | url = | journal = The Lancet Neurology | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 182–189 | doi = 10.1016/S1474-4422(02)00074-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial decision making===
Financial traders use biofeedback as a tool for regulating their level of emotional arousal in order to make better financial decisions. The technology company [[Philips]] and the Dutch bank [[ABN AMRO]] developed a biofeedback device for retail investors based on a galvanic skin response sensor.&lt;ref&gt;Djajadiningrat, T., Geurts, L., Munniksma, P.R., Christiaansen, G., &amp; de Bont, J.

===Stress reduction===
A randomized study by Sutarto et al. assessed the effect of resonant breathing biofeedback (recognize and control involuntary heart rate variability) among manufacturing operators; depression, anxiety and stress significantly decreased.&lt;ref name="Sutarto2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sutarto|first=AP|author2=Wahab, MN |author3=Zin NM |title=Resonant breathing biofeedback training for stress reduction among manufacturing operators|journal=Int J Occup Saf Ergon|year=2012|pages=549–61|doi=|pmid=23294659|volume=18|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=January 2013}}

===Macular disease of the retina===

==Clinical effectiveness==

===Research===
Moss, LeVaque, and Hammond (2004) observed that "Biofeedback and neurofeedback seem to offer the kind of evidence-based practice that the healthcare establishment is demanding."&lt;ref&gt;Geyman, J. P., Deyon, R. A., &amp; Ramsey, S. D. (Eds). (2000). ''Evidence-based clinical practice: Concepts and approach''. Boston: Butterworth-Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sackett, D. L., Straus, S. E., Richardson, W. S., Rosenberg, W., &amp; Haynes, R. B. (Eds.). ''Evidence-based medicine: How to practice and teach EBM''. Edinburgh, New York: Churchill Livingstone.&lt;/ref&gt; "From the beginning biofeedback developed as a research-based approach emerging directly from laboratory research on psychophysiology and behavior therapy, The ties of biofeedback/neurofeedback to the biomedical paradigm and to research are stronger than is the case for many other behavioral interventions" (p.&amp;nbsp;151).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Moss D. |author2=LaVaque T.

The Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback (AAPB) and the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research (ISNR) have collaborated in validating and rating treatment protocols to address questions about the clinical efficacy of biofeedback and neurofeedback applications, like ADHD and headache. In 2001, Donald Moss, then president of the Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback, and Jay Gunkelman, president of the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research, appointed a task force to establish standards for the efficacy of biofeedback and neurofeedback.

The Task Force document was published in 2002,&lt;ref name="LaVaque, T. J. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=LaVaque T. J. |author2=Hammond D.

A broader review was published&lt;ref&gt;Yucha, C., &amp; Gilbert, C. (2004). ''Evidence-based practice in biofeedback and neurofeedback''. Wheat Ridge, CO: Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback.&lt;/ref&gt; and later updated,&lt;ref name = Yucha2008/&gt; applying the same efficacy standards to the entire range of medical and psychological disorders. The 2008 edition reviewed the efficacy of biofeedback for over 40 clinical disorders, ranging from alcoholism/substance abuse to [[vulvar vestibulitis]]. The ratings for each disorder depend on the nature of research studies available on each disorder, ranging from anecdotal reports to [[double blind]] studies with a [[control group]]. Thus, a lower rating may reflect the lack of research rather than the ineffectiveness of biofeedback for the problem.

The randomized trial by Dehli et al. compared if the injection of a bulking agent in the anal canal was superior to sphincter training with biofeedback to treat fecal incontinence. Both methods lead to an improvement of FI, but comparisons of [[Fecal incontinence#Severity scales|St Mark's scores]] between the groups showed no differences in effect between treatments.&lt;ref name="Dehli2013"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dehli Trond, Stordahl Arvid, Vatten Lars J, Romundstad Pål R, Mevik Kjersti, Sahlin Ylva, Lindsetmo Rolv O, Vonen Barthold | year = 2013 | title = Sphincter training or anal injections of dextranomer for treatment of anal incontinence: a randomized trial | url = | journal = Scand.

===Efficacy===
Yucha and Montgomery's (2008) ratings are listed for the five levels of efficacy recommended by a joint Task Force and adopted by the Boards of Directors of the Association for Applied Psychophysiology (AAPB) and the International Society for Neuronal Regulation (ISNR).&lt;ref name="LaVaque, T. J. 2002"/&gt; From weakest to strongest, these levels include: not empirically supported, possibly efficacious, probably efficacious, efficacious, and efficacious and specific.

Level 1: '''Not empirically supported.''' This designation includes applications supported by anecdotal reports and/or case studies in non-peer-reviewed venues. Yucha and Montgomery (2008) assigned eating disorders, immune function, [[spinal cord injury]], and [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]] to this category.&lt;ref name = Yucha2008/&gt;

Level 2: '''Possibly efficacious.''' This designation requires at least one study of sufficient statistical power with well-identified outcome measures but lacking randomized assignment to a control condition internal to the study. Yucha and Montgomery (2008) assigned asthma, [[autism]], [[Bell palsy]], cerebral palsy, COPD, [[coronary artery disease]], [[cystic fibrosis]], depression, [[erectile dysfunction]], fibromyalgia, hand dystonia, [[irritable bowel syndrome]], [[PTSD]], [[repetitive strain injury]], [[respiratory failure]], stroke, [[tinnitus]], and urinary incontinence in children to this category.&lt;ref name = Yucha2008/&gt;

Level 3: '''Probably efficacious.''' This designation requires multiple observational studies, clinical studies, waitlist-controlled studies, and within subject and intrasubject replication studies that demonstrate efficacy. Yucha and Montgomery (2008) assigned [[alcoholism]] and substance abuse, [[arthritis]], [[diabetes mellitus]], fecal disorders in children, fecal incontinence in adults, [[insomnia]], pediatric headache, [[traumatic brain injury]], urinary incontinence in males, and vulvar vestibulitis ([[vulvodynia]]) to this category.&lt;ref name = Yucha2008/&gt;

Level 4: '''Efficacious.''' This designation requires the satisfaction of six criteria:

(a) In a comparison with a no-treatment control group, alternative treatment group, or sham (placebo) control using randomized assignment, the investigational treatment is shown to be statistically significantly superior to the control condition or the investigational treatment is equivalent to a treatment of established efficacy in a study with sufficient power to detect moderate differences.

(b) The studies have been conducted with a population treated for a specific problem, for whom inclusion criteria are delineated in a reliable, operationally defined manner.

(c) The study used valid and clearly specified outcome measures related to the problem being treated.

(d) The data are subjected to appropriate data analysis.

(e) The diagnostic and treatment variables and procedures are clearly defined in a manner that permits replication of the study by independent researchers.

(f) The superiority or equivalence of the investigational treatment has been shown in at least two independent research settings.

Yucha and Montgomery (2008) assigned attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, chronic pain, epilepsy, [[constipation]] (adult), headache (adult), hypertension, [[motion sickness]], [[Raynaud's disease]], and temporomandibular joint dysfunction to this category.&lt;ref name = Yucha2008/&gt;

Level 5: '''Efficacious and specific.''' The investigational treatment must be shown to be statistically superior to credible sham therapy, pill, or alternative bona fide treatment in at least two independent research settings. Yucha and Montgomery (2008) assigned urinary incontinence (females) to this category.&lt;ref name = Yucha2008/&gt;

===Criticisms===
In a healthcare environment that emphasizes cost containment and evidence-based practice, biofeedback and neurofeedback professionals continue to address skepticism in the medical community about the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of their treatments. Critics question how these treatments compare with conventional behavioral and medical interventions on efficacy and cost. The publication of white papers and rigorous evaluation of biofeedback interventions can address these legitimate questions and educate medical professionals, third-party payers, and the public about the value of these services.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, D., &amp; Andrasik, F.

==History==
[[Claude Bernard]] proposed in 1865 that the body strives to maintain a steady state in the internal environment ([[milieu intérieur]]), introducing the concept of [[homeostasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bernard C | author-link = Claude Bernard|title=An Introduction to the study of experimental medicine |publisher=Dover |location=Mineola, N.Y |year=1957 |orig-year= First published 1865 |pages= |isbn=0-486-20400-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1885, J.R. Tarchanoff showed that voluntary control of heart rate could be fairly direct (cortical-autonomic) and did not depend on "cheating" by altering breathing rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tarchanoff | first = JR | year = 1885 | title = [Voluntary acceleration of the heart beat in man] | journal = Pflüger's Archiv für die gesamte Physiologie | volume =35|  pages = 109–135 | doi = 10.1007/BF01612726}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, J. H. Bair studied voluntary control of the retrahens aurem muscle that wiggles the [[ear]], discovering that subjects learned this skill by inhibiting interfering muscles and demonstrating that skeletal muscles are self-regulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/h0074157 | last = Bair | first = JH | year = 1901 | title = Development of voluntary control | url = http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/pdf_extract/48/200/158 | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 8 | pages = 474–510 | issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alexander Graham Bell]] attempted to teach the deaf to speak through the use of two devices—the [[phonautograph]], created by [[Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville|Édouard-Léon Scott's]], and a [[Pressure measurement|manometric flame]].  The former translated sound vibrations into tracings on smoked glass to show their acoustic waveforms, while the latter allowed sound to be displayed as patterns of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bruce, Robert C. |title=Bell: Alexander Graham Bell and the conquest of solitude |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y |year=1990 |pages= |isbn=0-8014-9691-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After [[World War II]], mathematician [[Norbert Wiener]] developed [[Cybernetics|cybernetic theory]], that proposed that systems are controlled by monitoring their results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wiener, Norbert |title=Cybernetics Or Control And Communication In The Animal And The Machine |publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC |location= |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4325-9444-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants at the landmark 1969 conference at the Surfrider Inn in Santa Monica coined the term biofeedback from Wiener's [[feedback]].  The conference resulted in the founding of the Bio-Feedback Research Society, which permitted normally isolated researchers to contact and collaborate with each other, as well as popularizing the term "biofeedback."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moss D|title=Humanistic and transpersonal psychology: a historical and biographical sourcebook |publisher= [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]] |location=Westport, Conn |year=1999 |pages= |isbn=0-313-29158-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= | chapter = Biofeedback, mind-body medicine, and the higher limits of human nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work of [[B.F. Skinner]] led researchers to apply [[operant conditioning]] to biofeedback, decide which responses could be voluntarily controlled and which could not. In the first experimental demonstration of biofeedback Shearn&lt;ref&gt;169&lt;/ref&gt; used these procedures with heart rate. The effects of the perception of autonomic nervous system activity was initially explored by [[George Mandler]]'s group in 1958. In 1965, Maia Lisina combined classical and operant conditioning to train subjects to change blood vessel diameter, eliciting and displaying reflexive blood flow changes to teach subjects how to voluntarily control the temperature of their skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Lisina MI | year = 1965 | chapter = The role of orientation in the transformation of involuntary reactions into voluntary ones | editor = Voronin IG | editor2 = Leontiev AN | editor3 = Luria AR | editor4 = Sokolov EN | editor5 = Vinogradova OB | title = Orienting reflex and exploratory behavior | pages = 339–44 | location = Washington, DC | publisher = American Institute of Biological Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, H.D. Kimmel trained subjects to sweat using the galvanic skin response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kimmel HD |title=Instrumental conditioning of autonomically mediated responses in human beings |journal=Am Psychol |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=325–35 |date=May 1974 |pmid=4847492 |doi= 10.1037/h0037621|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hinduism:'''

Biofeedback systems have been known in India and some other countries for millennia. Ancient Hindu practices like yoga and Pranayama (breathing techniques) are essentially biofeedback methods. Many yogis and sadhus have been known to exercise control over their physiological processes. In addition to recent research on Yoga, Paul Brunton, the British writer who travelled extensively in India, has written about many cases he has witnessed.

Christopher deCharms (of Omneuron in San Francisco) in conjunction with Stanford University School of Medicine has developed a real-time fMRI for the purpose of training the brain to activate its own endogenous opiates. deCharms believes this will revolutionize the treatment of chronic pain. The patient can control his own pain by visually looking at his rtfMRI, watching his own reactions in real time, and then blocking the pathways causing pain. deCharms mentions that clinical trials with rtfMRI is measuring a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain.&lt;ref&gt;deCharms, R. C. (2008, February). Christopher deCharms: A look inside the brain in real time
 [Video file].  Retrieved from http://www.ted.com/talks/christopher_decharms_scans_the_brain_in_real_time?language=en
&lt;/ref&gt; With 8 participants in the study, deCharms et al.(2005) demonstrated that subjects can control the pain of heat stimulus, by visually observing in real time their brain activity. The subjects were instructed to use techniques such as changing the focus of their attention to the pain, and changing the emotional value of the pain.  Then while viewing their own fMRI in real time the subjects could observe the effect of their thoughts on the part of the brain called the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC).  When the subject 'controlled the pain' the virtual flame on the fMRI got dimmer.  Results from this study indicate two things: 1. That subjects can learn to voluntarily control brain activity in a specific region of the brain, and 2. There is a significant increase in the ability of healthy subjects to control their pain with repeated training.  This study was then repeated with 8 patients with chronic intractable pain. The results showed that these patients were successful in reducing their pain rating by 64% (using the McGill Pain Questionnaire).  The authors state that this is not yet a 'treatment', but still under serious investigation.&lt;ref&gt;deCharms, R.

==In popular culture==
* Biofeedback data and biofeedback technology are used by Massimiliano Peretti in a contemporary art environment, the [[Amigdalae]] project.  This project explores the way in which emotional reactions filter and distort human [[perception]] and observation.  During the performance, biofeedback medical technology, such as the [[EEG]], [[body temperature]] variations, heart rate, and galvanic responses, are used to analyze an audience's emotions while they watch the video art.  Using these signals, the music changes so that the consequent sound environment simultaneously mirrors and influences the viewer's [[emotional state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kontinuita.com/ |title=under changes |publisher=Kontinuita.com |accessdate=2012-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scope-art.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=102&amp;Itemid=206 |title=Scope New York Home |publisher=Scope-art.com |accessdate=2012-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More information is available at the website of the CNRS French National Center of Neural Research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cogimage.dsi.cnrs.fr/seminaires/resumes/resume_amygdalae_2005.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Charles Wehrenberg implemented ''competitive-relaxation'' as a gaming paradigm with the ''Will Ball Games'' circa 1973. In the first bio-mechanical versions, comparative GSR inputs monitored each player's relaxation response and moved the ''Will Ball'' across a playing field appropriately using stepper motors.[[Image: WillBall table.png| thumb|WillBall gaming table 1973]] In 1984, Wehrenberg programmed the ''Will Ball'' games for Apple II computers. The ''Will Ball'' game itself is described as pure ''competitive-relaxation''; ''Brain Ball'' is a duel between one player's left- and right-brain hemispheres; ''Mood Ball'' is an obstacle-based game; ''Psycho Dice'' is a psycho-kinetic game.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Wehrenberg ''Will Ball'', Solo Zone, San Francisco, 1995/2001 {{ISBN|1-886163-02-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 The HeartMath Institute developed an educational system based on heart rhythm measurement and display on a Personal Computer (Windows/Macintosh). Their systems have been copied by many but are still unique in the way they assist people to learn about and self-manage their physiology. A handheld version of their system was released in 2006 and is completely portable, being the size of a small mobile phone and having rechargeable batteries. With this unit, one can move around and go about daily business while gaining feedback about inner psycho-physiological states.
* In 2001, the company [[Journey to Wild Divine]] began producing biofeedback hardware and software for the [[Macintosh]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[operating system]]s. Third-party and open-source software and games are also available for the Wild Divine hardware. ''[[Tetris 64]]'' makes use of biofeedback to adjust the speed of the tetris puzzle game.
* [[David Rosenboom]] has worked to develop musical instruments that would respond to mental and physiological commands. Playing these instruments can be learned through a process of biofeedback.
* In the mid-1970s, an episode of the television series ''The Bionic Woman'' featured a doctor who could "heal" himself using biofeedback techniques to communicate to his body and react to stimuli. For example, he could exhibit "super" powers, such as walking on hot coals, by feeling the heat on the sole of his feet and then convincing his body to react by sending large quantities of perspiration to compensate. He could also convince his body to deliver extremely high levels of adrenalin to provide more energy to allow him to run faster and jump higher. When injured, he could slow his heart rate to reduce blood pressure, send extra platelets to aid in clotting a wound, and direct white blood cells to an area to attack infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb episode|0526163}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the science-fiction book ''Quantum Lens'' by Douglas E. Richards, bio-feedback is used to enhance certain abilities to detect quantum effects that give the user special powers.

'''Buddhist logico-epistemology''' is a term used in Western scholarship for ''[[pramāṇa]]-vāda'' (doctrine of proof) and ''Hetu-vidya'' (science of causes). Pramāṇa-vāda is an [[epistemological]] study of the nature of knowledge; Hetu-vidya is a system of [[logic]].&lt;ref&gt;''Pramanasamuccaya of Dingnaga'' : 5/14,1&lt;/ref&gt; These models developed in India during the [[5th century|5th]] through [[7th century|7th]] centuries.

The early Buddhists texts show that the historical Buddha was familiar with certain rules of reasoning used for debating purposes and made use of these against his opponents. He also seems to have held certain ideas about epistemology and reasoning, though he did not put forth a logico-epistemological system. The structure of debating rules and processes can be seen in the early Theravada text the [[Kathāvatthu]]. 

The first Buddhist thinker to discuss logical and epistemic issues systematically was [[Vasubandhu]] in his ''Vāda-vidhi'' ("A Method for Argumentation"), who was influenced by the Hindu work on reasoning, the ''[[Nyāya-sūtra]]''.&lt;ref name="Anacker, Stefan 2005, p.31"&gt;Anacker, Stefan (2005, rev.ed.). ''Seven Works of Vasubandhu: The Buddhist Psychological Doctor. '' Delhi, India: Motilal Banarsidass. (First published: 1984; Reprinted: 1986, 1994, 1998; Corrected: 2002; Revised: 2005), p.31&lt;/ref&gt;

A mature system of Buddhist logic and epistemology was founded by the Buddhist scholar [[Dignāga]] (c. 480–540 CE) in his ''magnum opus'', the ''[[Pramāṇa-samuccaya]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tucci |first=Giuseppe |year=1929 |title=Buddhist Logic before Dinnaga (Asanga, Vasubandhu, Tarka-sastras) |journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland |pages=451–488}}{{volume needed|date=June 2018}}{{issue needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thdl.org"&gt;{{cite journal |editor-last=Tobden |editor-first=Tashi |last=Sadhukhan |first=Sanjit Kumar |year=1994 |title=A Short History of Buddhist Logic in Tibet |journal=Bulletin of Tibetology |series=New Series |volume=30 |issue=3 |location=Gangtok, Sikkim |publisher=Sikkim Research Institute of Tibetology |url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/bot/bot_1994_03_full.pdf |access-date=2009-03-14 |pages=7–8 |archive-url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/242822/bot_1994_03_full.pdf |archive-date=2012-05-24 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dharmakirti]] further developed this system with several innovations. Dharmakirti's ''[[Pramanavarttika]]'' ('Commentary on Valid Cognition') became the main source of epistemology and reasoning in [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugon, Pascale, "Tibetan Epistemology and Philosophy of Language", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''(Spring 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/epistemology-language-tibetan/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Scholars such as H.N. Randle and [[Fyodor Shcherbatskoy]] (1930s) initially employed terms such as “Indian Logic” and “Buddhist Logic” to refer to the Indian tradition of [[inference]] ([[anumana]]), [[epistemology]] ([[pramana]]) and 'science of causes' (''hetu-vidya''). This tradition developed in the orthodox [[Hindu]] tradition known as [[Nyaya]] as well as in [[Buddhist philosophy]]. Logic in classical India, writes [[Bimal Krishna Matilal]], is "the systematic study of informal inference-patterns, the rules of debate, the identification of sound inference vis-à-vis sophistical argument, and similar topics".&lt;ref name="Matilal, Bimal Krishna 1998 p.1"&gt;Matilal, Bimal Krishna (author), Ganeri, Jonardon (editor) &amp; (Tiwari, Heeraman)(1998). ''The Character of Logic in India''. Albany, NY, USA: State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-3739-6}} (HC:acid free), p.12&lt;/ref&gt; As Matilal notes, this tradition developed out systematic debate theory (''vadavidya''):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Logic as the study of the form of correct arguments and inference patterns, developed in India from the methodology of philosophical debate. The art of conducting a philosophical debate was prevalent probably as early as the time of the [[Buddha]] and the [[Mahavira]] (Jina), but it became more systematic and methodical a few hundred years later.&lt;ref&gt;Bimal Krishna Matilal. 'Introducing Indian Logic' in Ganeri, ''Indian logic A Reader'', p 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

‘Indian Logic’ should be understood as being a different system of logic than modern [[classical logic]] (e.g. modern [[predicate calculus]]), but as ''anumāna''-theory, a system in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;Mohanty, Jitendra Nath (1992). ''Reason and Tradition in Indian Thought: An Essay on the Nature of Indian Philosophical Thinking''. New York, USA: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-823960-2}}, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Indian Logic’ was also influenced by the study of grammar, whereas Classical Logic which principally informed modern Western Logic was influenced by the study of mathematics.&lt;ref name="Matilal, Bimal Krishna 1998 p.14"&gt;Matilal, Bimal Krishna (author), Ganeri, Jonardon (editor) &amp; (Tiwari, Heeraman)(1998). ''The Character of Logic in India''. Albany, NY, USA: State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-3739-6}} (HC:acid free), p.14&lt;/ref&gt; 

A key difference between Western Logic and Indian Logic is that certain epistemological issues are included within Indian Logic, whereas in modern Western Logic they are deliberately excluded. Indian Logic includes general questions regarding the ‘nature of the derivation of knowledge’, [[epistemology]], from information supplied by evidence, evidence which in turn may be another item of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Matilal, Bimal Krishna 1998 p.14"/&gt; For this reason, other scholars use the term "logico-epistemology" to refer to this tradition, emphasizing the centrality of the epistemic project for Indian logical reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Bronkhorst, J. Buddhist Teaching in India, chapter 3. 
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, J. The Ornament of the Middle Way: A Study of the Madhyamaka Thought of Shantarakshita page 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfus, Georges B. J. Recognizing Reality: Dharmakirti's Philosophy and Its Tibetan Interpretations. page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Georges Dreyfus, while Western logic tends to be focused on formal validity and deduction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The concern of Indian "logicians" is quite different. They intend to provide a critical and systematic analysis of the diverse means of correct cognition that we use practically in our quest for knowledge. In this task, they discuss the nature and types of pramana. Although Indian philosophers disagree on the types of cognition that can be considered valid, most recognize perception and inference as valid. Within this context, which is mostly epistemological and practically oriented, topics such as the nature and types of correct reasoning that pertain to logic in the large sense of the word are discussed.&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfus, Georges B. J. 'Recognizing Reality: Dharmakirti's Philosophy and Its Tibetan Interpretations.' SUNY Press, 1997, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

===Pramana===
[[Pramāṇa]] (Tib. ''tshad ma'') is often translated as "valid cognition" or "instrument of knowledge" and refers to epistemic ways of knowing. Decisive in distinguishing [[Buddhist]] pramana from what is generally understood as Orthodox Hindu philosophy is the issue of [[epistemology|epistemological]] justification. All schools of [[Indian logic]] recognize various sets of 'valid justifications for knowledge' or ''[[pramana]]''. Buddhist logico-epistemology was influenced by the  [[Nyāya]] school's methodology, but where the Nyaya recognised a set of four pramanas—perception, inference, comparison and testimony—the Buddhists (i.e. the school of Dignaga) only recognized two: perception and inference. For Dignaga, comparison and testimony are just special forms of inference.&lt;ref&gt;Sidertis, Mark. Buddhism as Philosophy: An Introduction, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. 2007, page 209.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most Indic ''pramanavada'' accept '[[perception]]' (Sanskrit: pratyakṣa) and 'inference' (Sanskrit: anumāna), but for some schools of orthodox Hinduism the 'received textual tradition' (Sanskrit: āgamāḥ) is an epistemological category equal to perception and inference. The Buddhist logical tradition of Dignaga and Dharmakirti accept scriptural tradition ''only'' if it accords with pratyakṣa and anumāna. This view is thus in line with the Buddha's injunction in the ''[[Kalama Sutta]]'' not to accept anything on mere tradition or scripture.&lt;ref&gt;Kalama Sutta, [[Anguttara Nikaya]] III.65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
===Early Buddhist background===
====Epistemology====
The time of the Buddha Gautama was a lively intellectual culture with many differing philosophical theories. [[KN Jayatilleke]], in his "Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge", uses the Pali Nikayas to glean the possible epistemological views of the historical Buddha and those of his contemporaries. According to his analysis of the Sangarava Sutta, during the Buddha's time, Indian views were divided into three major camps with regards to knowledge:&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, London, 1963, page 170&lt;/ref&gt;

*The Traditionalists (Anussavika) who regarded knowledge as being derived from scriptural sources (the Brahmins who upheld the Vedas).
*The Rationalists (Takki  Vimamsi) who only used reasoning or ''takka'' (the skeptics and materialists). 
*The "Experientialists" who held that besides reasoning, a kind of supra-normal yogic insight was able to bring about unique forms of knowledge (the Jains, the middle and late Upanishadic sages).   

The Buddha rejected the first view in several texts such as the [[Kalama sutta]], arguing that a claim to scriptural authority (''sabda'') was not a source of knowledge, as was claimed by the later Hindu [[Mimamsa]] school.&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, London, 1963, page 173&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha also seems to have criticized those who used reason (''takka''). According to Jayatilleke, in the Pali Nikayas, this term refers "primarily to denote the reasoning that was employed to construct and defend metaphysical theories and perhaps meant the reasoning of sophists  and dialecticians only in a secondary sense".&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, London, 1963, page 206&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha rejected metaphysical speculations, and put aside certain questions which he named [[The unanswered questions|the unanswerables]] (''avyakatas''), including questions about the soul and if the universe is eternal or not.

The Buddha's epistemological view has been a subject of debate among modern scholars. Some such as [[David Kalupahana]], have seen him first and foremost as an [[empiricist]] because of his teaching that knowledge required verification through the six sense fields ([[ayatanas]]).&lt;ref&gt;D. J. Kalupahana, A Buddhist tract on empiricism, https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kk3n/80-300/kalupahana1969.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kalama sutta]] states that verification through one’s own personal experience (and the experiences of the wise) is an important means of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, page 177; 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Buddha's view of truth was also based on the soteriological and therapeutic concern of ending suffering. In the "Discourse to Prince Abhaya" (MN.I.392–4) the Buddha states that a belief should only be accepted if it leads to wholesome consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel, Steven M (editor); A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy, 2013, page 228.&lt;/ref&gt; This has led scholars such as [[Caroline Augusta Foley Rhys Davids|Mrs Rhys Davids]] and [[Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin|Vallée-Poussin]] to see the Buddha's view as a form of [[Pragmatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Poussin; Bouddhisme, Third Edition, Paris, 1925, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of truth as what is useful is also shown by the Buddha's [[parable of the arrow]].

[[K. N. Jayatilleke]] sees Buddha's epistemological view as empirically based which also includes a particular view of causation ([[dependent origination]]): "inductive inferences in Buddhism are based on a theory of causation. These inferences are made on the data of perception. What is considered to constitute knowledge are direct inferences made on the basis of  such perceptions."&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, page 457.&lt;/ref&gt; Jayatilleke argues the Buddhas statements in the Nikayas tacitly imply an adherence to some form of [[correspondence theory]], this is most explicit in the 'Apannaka Sutta'. He also notes that [[Coherentism]] is also taken as a criterion for truth in the Nikayas, which contains many instances of the Buddha debating opponents by showing how they have contradicted themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, page 352-353.&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes that the Buddha seems to have held that utility and truth go hand in hand, and therefore something which is true is also useful (and vice versa, something false is not useful for ending suffering).&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, page 359.&lt;/ref&gt; Echoing this view, Christian Coseru writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;canonical sources make quite clear that several distinct factors play a crucial role in the acquisition of knowledge. These are variously identified with the testimony of sense experience, introspective or intuitive experience, inferences  drawn from these two types of experience, and some  form of  coherentism, which  demands  that truth claims  remain  consistent  across the entire corpus  of  doctrine. Thus, to the extent that Buddhists  employ  reason, they  do so primarily in order further to advance the  empirical investigation  of   phenomena.&lt;ref&gt; Coseru, Christian. Reason and Experience in Buddhist Epistemology In Steven Emmanuel (ed.), ''A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy''. Wiley-Blackwell (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Debate and analysis====
The [[Early Buddhist Texts]] show that during this period many different kinds of philosophers often engaged in public debates (''vivada''). The early texts also mention that there was a set procedure (''patipada'') for these debates and that if someone does not abide by it they are unsuitable to be debated.&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, London, 1963, page 232-233&lt;/ref&gt; There also seems to have been at least a basic conception of valid and invalid reasoning, including, according to Jayatilleke, fallacies (''hetvabhasah'') such as ''[[petitio principii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, London, 1963, page 236&lt;/ref&gt; Various fallacies were further covered under what were called ''nigrahasthana'' or "reasons for censure" by which one could lose the debate. Other ''nigrahasthanas'' included ''arthantaram'' or "shifting the topic", and not giving a coherent reply.&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, London, 1963, page 238&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to Jayatilleke, 'pure reasoning' or 'a priori' reasoning is rejected by the Buddha as a source of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, London, 1963, page 273&lt;/ref&gt; While reason could be useful in deliberation, it could not establish truth on its own. 

In contrast to his opponents, the Buddha termed himself a defender of 'analysis' or 'vibhajjavada'. He held that after proper rational analysis, assertions could be classified in the following way:&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, London, 1963, page 279-80&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Those which can be asserted or denied categorically (''ekamsika'')
*Those which cannot be asserted or denied categorically (''anekamsika''), which the Buddha further divided into:
**Those  which  after  analysis  (''vibhajja-'')  could  be  known to be true or  false.
**Those like the avyakata-theses, which  could  not  be  thus known.

This view of analysis differed from that of the [[Jains]], which held that all views were ''anekamsika'' and also were relative, that is, they were true or false depending on the standpoint one viewed it from ([[anekantavada]]).

The early texts also mention that the Buddha held there to be 'four kinds of explanations of questions".&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, London, 1963, page 282&lt;/ref&gt;

* a question which ought to be explained categorically 
* a question which ought to be answered with a counter question
* a question which ought to be set aside (''thapaniya'')
* a question which ought to be explained analytically

The Buddha also made use of various terms which reveal some of his views on meaning and language. For example, he held that many concepts or designations (''paññatti'') could be used in conventional everyday speech while at the same time not referring to anything that exists ultimately (such as the pronouns like "I" and "Me").&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, London, 1963, page 321&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Hayes likewise points to the Potthapada sutta as an example of the Early Buddhist tendency towards a [[nominalist]] perspective on language and meaning in contrast to the Brahmanical view which tended to see language as reflecting real existents.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Dignaga on the interpretation of Signs, page 85-86&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Buddha also divided statements (bhasitam) into two types with regards to their meaning: those which were intelligible, meaningful (''sappatihirakatam'') and those meaningless or incomprehensible (''appatihirakatam'').&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, London, 1963, page 325&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jayatilleke, "in  the  Nikayas  it  is  considered  meaningless  to  make  a
statement  unless  the  speaker  could  attach  a  verifiable  content  to  each of  its  terms."&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, London, 1963, page 327&lt;/ref&gt; This is why the Buddha held that statements about the existence of a self or soul (atman) were ultimately meaningless, because they could not be verified.

The Buddha, like his contemporaries, also made use of the "four corners" ([[catuṣkoṭi]]) logical structure as a tool in argumentation. According to Jayatilleke, these "four forms of predication" can be rendered thus:&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, London, 1963, page 335&lt;/ref&gt; 
#S is P, e.g. ''atthi paro loko'' (there  is a next  world).
#S is not P,  e.g. ''natthi  paro  loko'' (there is no next world).
#S is and is not P, e.g. ''atthi ca natthi ca paro  loko'' (there is and is no next world).
#S neither is nor is not P, e.g. ''n'ev'atthi  na natthi paro loko'' (there neither is nor is there no next world)

The Buddha in the Nikayas seems to regard these as "'the  four  possible  positions'  or  logical  alternatives that a proposition  can take".&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, London, 1963, page 339&lt;/ref&gt; Jayatilleke notes that the last two are clearly non-Aristotelian in nature. The Buddhists in the Nikayas use this logical structure to analyze the truth of statements and classify them. When all four were denied regarding a statement or question, it was held to be meaningless and thus set aside or rejected (but ''not negated'').&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, London, 1963, page 347&lt;/ref&gt;

====Two levels of Truth====
The early texts mention of two modes of discourse used by the Buddha. Jayatilleke writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;when he is speaking about things  or persons  we  should  not  presume  that  he  is  speaking  about  entities  or substances;  to  this  extent  his  meaning  is  to  be  inferred  (neyyattha-). But  when  he  is pointing  out  the  misleading  implications  of  speech  or using  language  without  these  implications,  his  meaning  is  plain  and direct  and  nothing  is to  be  inferred  (nitattha-). This  is a valid  distinction  which  certainly  holds  good  for  the  Nikäyas  at  least,  in  the  light of the  above-statement.&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, London, 1963, page 363&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The later commentarial and [[Abhidharma]] literature began to use this distinction as an epistemic one. They spoke of [[two truths doctrine|two levels of truth]], the conventional (samutti), and the absolute (paramattha). &lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, London, 1963, page 364&lt;/ref&gt; This theory of double truth became very influential in later Buddhist epistemic discourse.

===Kathāvatthu===
The [[Theravada]] [[Kathāvatthu]] (points of controversy) is a Pali Buddhist text which discusses the proper method for critical discussions on doctrine. Its date is debated by scholars but it might date to the time of Ashoka (C. 240 BC).&lt;ref&gt;James P. McDermott, KATHAVATTHU; Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume VII: Abhidharma Buddhism to 150 A.D.&lt;/ref&gt; Western cholarship by St. Schayer and following him A. K. Warder, have argued that there is an "anticipations of propositional logic" in the text.&lt;ref&gt;Matilal, Bimal Krishna, 'The Character of Logic in India' State University of New York Press 1998, page 37&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Jonardon Ganeri "the leading concern of the text is with issues of ''balance'' and ''fairness'' in the conduct of a dialogue and it recommends a strategy of argumentation which guarantees that both parties to a point of controversy have their arguments properly weighed and considered."&lt;ref&gt;Ganeri, Jonardon. Argumentation, dialogue and the "Kathāvatthu", Journal of Indian Philosophy August 2001, Volume 29, Issue 4, pp 485–493&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Kathāvatthu, a proper reasoned dialogue (''vadayutti'') is structured as follows: there is a point of contention - whether A is B; this is divided into several 'openings' (''atthamukha''):&lt;ref&gt;Ganeri, Jonardon. Argumentation, dialogue and the "Kathāvatthu", Journal of Indian Philosophy August 2001, Volume 29, Issue 4, pp 485–493&lt;/ref&gt;

#Is A B?
#Is A not B?
#Is A B everywhere?
#Is A B always?
#Is A B in everything?
#Is A not B everywhere?
#Is A not B always?
#Is A not B in everything? 

These help clarify the attitude of someone towards their thesis in the proceeding argumentative process. Jonardon Ganeri outlines the process thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Each such ‘opening’ now proceeds as an independent dialogue, and each is divided into five stages: the way forward (anuloma), the way back (patikamma), the refutation (niggaha), the application (upanayana) and the conclusion (niggamana). In the way forward, the proponent solicits from the respondent the endorsement of a thesis, and then tries to argue against it. In the way back, the respondent turns the tables, soliciting from the proponent the endorsement of the counter-thesis, and then trying argue against it. In the refutation, the respondent, continuing, seeks to refute the argument that the proponent had advanced against the thesis. The application and conclusion repeat and reaffirm that the proponent’s argument against the respondent’s thesis is unsound, while the respondent’s argument against the proponent’s counter-thesis is sound.&lt;ref&gt;Ganeri, Jonardon. Argumentation, dialogue and the "Kathāvatthu", Journal of Indian Philosophy August 2001, Volume 29, Issue 4, pp 485–493&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Milinda-panha===
Another Buddhist text which depicts the standards for rational debate among Buddhists is the [[Milindapanha]] ("Questions of Menander", 1st century BCE) which is a dialogue between the Buddhist monk Nagasena and an Indo-Greek King. In describing the art of debate and dialogue, Nagasena states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When scholars talk a matter over one with another, then is there a winding up, an unravelling, one or other is convicted of error, and he then acknowledges his mistake; distinctions are drawn, and contra-distinctions; and yet thereby they are not angered.&lt;ref&gt;Dov M. Gabbay John Woods (editors). Greek, Indian and Arabic Logic, Volume 1. 1st Edition. 2004. page 310.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The various elements outlined here make up the standard procedure of Buddhist debate theory. There is an 'unravelling' or explication (''nibbethanam'') of one's thesis and stances and then there is also a 'winding up' ending in the censure (''niggaho'') of one side based on premises he has accepted and the rejoinders of his opponent.&lt;ref&gt;Dov M. Gabbay John Woods (editors). Greek, Indian and Arabic Logic, Volume 1. 1st Edition. 2004. page 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abhidharma===
The Buddhist Abhidharma schools developed a classification of four types of reasoning which became widely used in Buddhist thought. The Mahayana philosopher [[Asanga]] in his [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]], outlines these four reasons (''yukti'') that one may use to inquire about the nature of things. According to Cristian Coseru these are:&lt;ref&gt;Coseru, Christian. Reason and Experience in Buddhist Epistemology In Steven Emmanuel (ed.), ''A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy''.

#The principle of dependence (apeksāyukti), which takes into account the fact that conditioned things  necessarily arise in  dependence upon conditions: it is a principle of reason, for instance, that sprouts depend on seeds.
#The principle of causal efficacy (kāryakāranayukti), which accounts for the difference between things in terms of the different causal conditions for their apprehension: it is a principle of reason, thus, that, in dependence upon form, a faculty of  vision, and visual awareness,  one has visual rather than, say, auditory or tactile  experiences.
#The realization of evidence from experience (sāksātkriyāsādhanayukti). We realize the presence  of   water from moisture and of fire from smoke.  
#The principle of natural reasoning, or the principle of reality (dharmatāyukti), which concerns the phenomenal character of things as perceived (for instance, the wetness and fluidity of water).

According to Coseru "what we have here are examples of natural reasoning or of reasoning from experience, rather than attempts to use deliberative modes of reasoning for the purpose of justifying a given thesis or arguing for its conditions of satisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;Coseru, Christian.

===Nyaya===
{{Main|Nyaya}}
[[File:4 Pramanas, epistemology according to ancient Nyayasutras.svg|thumb|200px|The Nyaya school considers perception, inference, comparison/analogy, and testimony from reliable sources as four means to correct knowledge, holding that perception is the ultimate source of such knowledge.]]

The [[Nyāya Sūtras]] of Gotama (c. 1st or 2nd century CE) is the founding text of the Nyaya school. The text systematically lays out logical rules for argumentation in the form of a five step schema and also sets forth a theory of epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;Dov M. Gabbay John Woods (editors). Greek, Indian and Arabic Logic, Volume 1. 1st Edition. 2004. page 321&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jonardon Ganeri, the Nyaya sutra brought about a transformation in Indian thinking about logic. First, it began a shift away from interest in argumentation and debate towards the formal properties of sound [[inference]]. Secondly the Nyaya sutra led a shift to rule governed forms of logical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Dov M. Gabbay John Woods (editors). Greek, Indian and Arabic Logic, Volume 1. 1st Edition. 2004. page 321&lt;/ref&gt; 

BK Matilal outlines the five steps or limbs of the Nyaya method of reasoning as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Matilal, Bimal Krishna (author), Ganeri, Jonardon (editor) &amp; (Tiwari, Heeraman)(1998). ''The Character of Logic in India''. Albany, NY, USA: State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-3739-6}} (HC:acid free), p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

#There is fire on the hill. [thesis]
#For there is smoke. [reason]
#(Wherever there is smoke, there is fire), as in the kitchen. [example]
#This is such a case (smoke on the hill).
#Therefore, it is so, i.e., there is fire on the hill.

Later Buddhist thinkers like Vasubandhu would see several of these steps as redundant and would affirm that only the first two or three were necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Matilal, Bimal Krishna (author), Ganeri, Jonardon (editor) &amp; (Tiwari, Heeraman)(1998). ''The Character of Logic in India''. Albany, NY, USA: State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-3739-6}} (HC:acid free), p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Naiyayikas (the Nyaya scholars) also accepted four valid means (''pramaṇa'') of obtaining valid knowledge (''pramana'') - perception (''pratyakṣa''), inference (''anumāna''), comparison (''[[upamāna]]'') and word/testimony of reliable sources (''śabda''). 

The systematic discussions of the Nyaya school influenced the Medieval Buddhist philosophers who developed their own theories of inferential reasoning and epistemic warrant (pramana). The Nyaya became one of the main opponents of the Buddhists.

===Mahayana Buddhist philosophy===
[[Nagarjuna]] (c. 150 – c. 250 CE), one of the most influential Buddhist thinkers, defended the theory of the emptiness ([[shunyata]]) of [[phenomena]] and attacked theories which posited an essence or true existence ([[svabhava]]) to phenomena in his magnum opus [[Mulamadhyamakakarika|The Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way]].&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, ''The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change.'' Harvard University Press, 2000, pages 221-222.&lt;/ref&gt; He used the Buddhist [[catuṣkoṭi]] ("four corners" or "four positions") to construct [[reductio ad absurdum]] arguments against numerous theories which posited essences to certain phenomena, such as causality and movement. In Nagarjuna's works and those of his followers, the four positions on a particular thesis are negated or ruled out (Sk. ''pratiṣedha'') as exemplified by the first verse of Nagarjuna's Middle way verses which focuses on a critique of causation:&lt;ref&gt;Ruegg, David Seyfort. The Buddhist Philosophy of the Middle: Essays on Indian and TibetanMadhyamaka (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), page 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Entities of any kind are not ever found anywhere produced from themselves,  from  another,  from  both  [themselves  and  another], and also from no cause."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nagarjuna also famously relied upon refutation based argumentation (''vitanda'') drawing out the consequences (''prasanga'') and presuppositions of his opponents' own theories and showing them to be self refuting.&lt;ref&gt;Dov M. Gabbay John Woods (editors). Greek, Indian and Arabic Logic, Volume 1. 1st Edition. 2004. page 330&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ''vaitandika'' only seeks to disprove his opponents arguments without putting forward a thesis of his own, the Hindu Nyaya school philosophers such as [[Vatsyayana]] saw it as unfair and also irrational (because if you argue against P, you must have a thesis, mainly not P).&lt;ref&gt;Matilal, Bimal Krishna, 'The Character of Logic in India' State University of New York Press 1998, page 52&lt;/ref&gt; According to Matilal, Nagarjuna's position of not putting forth any implied thesis through his refutations would be rational if seen as a form of [[illocutionary act]].&lt;ref&gt;Matilal, Bimal Krishna, 'The Character of Logic in India' State University of New York Press 1998, page 52&lt;/ref&gt;

Nagarjuna's reductios and the structure of the [[catuṣkoṭi]] became very influential in the Buddhist [[Madhyamaka]] school of philosophy which sees itself as a continuation of Nagarjuna's thought. Nagarjuna also discusses the four modes of knowing of the Nyaya school, but he is unwilling to accept that such epistemic means bring us ultimate knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Coseru, Christian. Reason and Experience in Buddhist Epistemology In Steven Emmanuel (ed.), ''A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy''. Wiley-Blackwell (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nagarjuna's epistemic stance continues to be debated among modern scholars, his skepticism of the ability of reason and language to capture the nature of reality and his view of reality as being empty of true existence have led some to see him as a skeptic, mystic, nihilist or agnostic, while others interpret him as a Wittgensteinian analyst, an anti-realist, or deconstructionist.&lt;ref&gt;Coseru, Christian. Reason and Experience in Buddhist Epistemology In Steven Emmanuel (ed.), ''A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy''. Wiley-Blackwell (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nagarjuna is also said to be the author of the ''Upāyaśṛdaya'' one of the first Buddhist texts on proper reasoning and argumentation.&lt;ref&gt;Tillemans, "Buddhist Epistemology (pramāṇavāda)" in William Edelglass and Jay L. Garfield (Editors)''Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy.''&lt;/ref&gt; He also developed the Buddhist theory of two truths, defending ultimate truth as the truth of emptiness.

[[Vasubandhu]] was one of the first Buddhist thinkers to write various works on sound reasoning and debate, including the ''Vādavidhi'' (Methods of Debate), and the ''Vādavidhāna'' (Rules of Debate).&lt;ref&gt;Tillemans, "Buddhist Epistemology (pramāṇavāda)" in William Edelglass and Jay L. Garfield (Editors)''Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Vasubandhu was influenced by the system of the Nyaya school. Vasubandhu also introduced the concept of 'logical pervasion' ([[vyapti]]).&lt;ref name="Anacker, Stefan 2005, p.31"/&gt; He also introduced the [[Trairūpya]] (triple inferential sign). The Trairūpya is a logical argument that contains three constituents which a logical ‘sign’ or ‘mark’ (linga) must fulfill to be 'valid source of knowledge' ([[pramana]]):&lt;ref&gt;Matilal, Bimal Krishna (author), Ganeri, Jonardon (editor) &amp; (Tiwari, Heeraman)(1998). ''The Character of Logic in India''. Albany, NY, USA: State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-3739-6}} (HC:acid free), p.7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

#It should be present in the case or object under consideration, the ‘subject-locus' (pakṣa)  
#It should be present in a ‘similar case’ or a homologue (sapakṣa)  
#It should not be present in any ‘dissimilar case’ or heterologue (vipakṣa)

===Dignaga-Dharmakirti school===
{{see also|Dignaga|Dharmakirti}}
[[File:Dignaga.jpg|180 × 240px|thumbnail|Dignaga. A statue in [[Elista]], [[Russia]].]]
[[File:2 Pramana Epistemology Buddhism.svg|thumb|200px|Buddhist epistemology holds that perception and inference are the means to correct knowledge.]]
[[Dignaga]] (c. 480 – 540 CE) is the founder of an influential tradition of Buddhist logic and epistemology, which was widely influential in Indian thought and brought about a turn to epistemological questions in Indian philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Recognizing Reality: Dharmakirti’s Philosophy and its Tibetan Interpretations, (Suny: 1997), page 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; According to B.K. Matilal, "Dinnaga was perhaps the most creative logician in medieval (400-1100) India."&lt;ref&gt;Matilal, Bimal Krishna, 'The Character of Logic in India' State University of New York Press 1998, page 88&lt;/ref&gt;

Dignaga defended the validity of only two pramanas, perception and inference in his magnum opus, the ''pramanasamuccaya''. As noted by Cristian Coseru, Dignaga's theory of knowledge is strongly grounded on perception "as an epistemic modality for establishing a cognitive event as knowledge". His theory also does not "make a radical distinction between epistemology and the psychological processes of  cognition."&lt;ref&gt;"Coseru, Christian. Reason and Experience in Buddhist Epistemology In Steven Emmanuel (ed.), ''A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy''. Wiley-Blackwell (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; For Dignaga, perception is never in error, for it is the most basic raw sense data. It is only through mental construction and inferential thinking that we err in the interpretation of perceptual particulars.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes (1982), p 139.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dignaga also wrote on language and meaning. His "apoha" (exclusion) theory of meaning was widely influential. For Dignaga, a word can express its own meaning only by repudiating other meanings. The word 'cow' gives its own meaning only by the exclusion of all those things which are other than cow.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Richard, ''Dignāga on the Interpretation of Signs'' (Dordrecht: Reidel Publishing Company, 1982), page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following Dignaga, [[Dharmakirti]] (c. 7th century), contributed significantly to the development and application of Buddhist [[pramana]] theory. Dharmakīrti's ''[[Pramanavarttika|Pramāṇavārttika]]'', remains in Tibet as a central text on [[pramana]] and was widely commented on by various Indian and Tibetan scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Liberman (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=H9O57AB42yoC ''Dialectical Practice in Tibetan Philosophical Culture: An Ethnomethodological Inquiry into Formal Reasoning'']. Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers. p. 52. {{ISBN|978-0-7425-7686-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dharmakirti's theory of epistemology differed from Dignaga's by introducing the idea that for something to be a valid cognition it must "confirm causal efficacy" (''arthakriyāsthiti'') which "consists in [this cognition’s] compliance with [the object’s capacity to] perform a function" (''Pramāṇavārttika'' 2.1ac).&lt;ref&gt;Eltschinger, Vincent (2010). "Dharmakīrti: Revue internationale de philosophie". Buddhist Philosophy. 2010.3 (253): 397–440.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also one of the primary theorists of Buddhist atomism, according to which the only items considered to exist or be ultimately real are momentary particulars (''svalakṣaṇa'') including material atoms and momentary states of consciousness (dharmas).&lt;ref name="Prasad, Rajendra 2002"&gt;Prasad, Rajendra (2002). ''Dharmakirti's Theory of Inference : Revaluation and Reconstruction''. New Delhi, India: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Everything else is considered to be only conventional (''saṃvṛtisat'') and thus he has been seen as a nominalist, like Dignaga.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Tillemans (2011), [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dharmakiirti/ Dharmakirti], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

These two thinkers were very influential on later Buddhist philosophy. The "School of Dignāga" or the "Dignāga-Dharmakīrti school" is sometimes used to refer to this tradition. In Tibetan it is termed “those who follow reasoning” (Tibetan: ''rigs pa rjes su ‘brang ba''), which is back-translated into sanskrit by scholars as 'pramāṇavāda'.&lt;ref&gt;Tillemans, Tom, "Dharmakīrti", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/dharmakiirti/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Vincent Eltschinger has argued that Buddhist epistemology, especially Dharmakirti's, was an apologetic response to attacks by hostile Hindu opponents and thus was seen by Buddhists as "that which, by defeating the outsiders, removes the obstacles to the path towards liberation."&lt;ref&gt;Bisschop, Peter. Review: Vincent Eltschinger, ''Buddhist Epistemology as Apologetics''&lt;/ref&gt; Coseru meanwhile simply notes the inseparability of epistemic concerns from spiritual praxis for Buddhist epistemologists such as Dharmakirti: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is this praxis that leads a representative thinker such as Dharmakīrti to claim that the Buddha, whose view he and his successors claim to propound, is a true embodiment of the sources of knowledge. Thus, far from seeing a tension between empirical scrutiny and the exercise of reason, the Buddhist epistemological enterprise positions itself not merely as a dialogical disputational method for avoiding unwarranted beliefs, but as a practice aimed at achieving concrete, pragmatic ends. As Dharmakīrti reminds his fellow Buddhists, the successful accomplishment of any human goal is wholly dependent on having correct knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Coseru, Christian. Reason and Experience in Buddhist Epistemology In Steven Emmanuel (ed.), ''A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy''. Wiley-Blackwell (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later philosophers who worked on Buddhist epistemology and logic include Devendrabuddhi (630-690 C.E.), Dharmottara (750-8 10 C.E.), Prajñākaragupta (740-800 C.E.), [[Jñanasrimitra]] (975–1025) and [[Ratnakīrti]] (11th century).

===Bhāvaviveka and ''svatantrika''===
[[Bhāvaviveka]] (c. 500 - c. 578) appears to be the first Buddhist logician to employ the 'formal syllogism' (Wylie: sbyor ba'i tshig; Sanskrit: prayoga-vākya) in expounding the [[Mādhyamaka]] view, which he employed to considerable effect in his commentary to [[Nagarjuna]]'s ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' entitled the ''Prajñāpradīpa''.&lt;ref&gt;Ames, William L. (1993). "Bhāvaviveka's ''Prajñāpradīpa'' ~ A Translation of Chapter One: 'Examinations of Causal Conditions' (''Pratyaya'')". ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', 1993, vol.21. Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers, p.210&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bhāvaviveka was later criticized by [[Chandrakirti]] (540-600) for his use of logical arguments. For [[Chandrakirti]], a true Mādhyamika only uses reductio ad absurdum arguments and does not put forth positive arguments. Chandrakirti saw in the logico-epistemic tradition a commitment to a foundationalist epistemology and essentialist ontology, while for him a Mādhyamika's job should be to just deconstruct concepts which presuppose an essence.&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfus, Georges B. J. 'Recognizing Reality: Dharmakirti's Philosophy and Its Tibetan Interpretations.' SUNY Press, 1997, page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In spite of these criticisms, Buddhist philosophers such as Jñanagarbha (700-760) and [[Śāntarakṣita]] (725–788) continued to explain Madhyamaka philosophy through the use of formal syllogisms as well as adopting the conceptual schemas of the Dignaga-Dharmakirti school.&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfus, Georges B. J. 'Recognizing Reality: Dharmakirti's Philosophy and Its Tibetan Interpretations.' SUNY Press, 1997, page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency is termed ''Svātantrika'', while Chandrakirti's stance is termed ''Prasangika''. The [[Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction]] is a central topic of debate in Tibetan Buddhist philosophy.

===Tibetan tradition===
[[Tom Tillemans]], in discussing the Tibetan translation and assimilation of the logico-epistemological tradition, identifies two currents and transmission streams:

The first is the tradition of the [[Kadampa]] scholar Ngok Lodzawa Loden Shayrap (1059–1109) and Chapa Chögyi Sengge (1109–69) and their disciples, mainly located at Sangpu Neutok .&lt;ref name="rep.routledge.com"&gt;Tillemans, Tom J.F. (1998). 'Tibetan philosophy'. In E. Craig (Ed.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Routledge. Source: [http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/F003SECT4] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812075514/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/F003SECT4# |date=2009-08-12 }} (accessed: Saturday March 14, 2009), p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Chapa’s ''Tshad ma’i bsdus pa'' (English: 'Summaries of Epistemology and Logic') became the groundwork for the ‘Collected Topics’ (Tibetan: Düra; Wylie: bsdus grwa) literature, which in large part furnished the [[Gelugpa]]-based logical architecture and epistemology.&lt;ref name="rep.routledge.com"/&gt; These two scholars (whose works are now lost) strengthened the influence of [[Dharmakirti]] in Tibetan Buddhist scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfus, Georges B. J. Recognizing Reality: Dharmakirti's Philosophy and Its Tibetan Interpretations. page 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also another tradition of interpretation founded by [[Sakya Pandita]] (1182–1251), who wrote the ''Tshad-ma rigs-gter'' (English: "Treasury of Logic on Valid Cognition").&lt;ref&gt;Pettit (?: p.469): "A treatise on Buddhist logic (pramana) by Sakya Pandita, which is probably the most important work of its kind in Tibet except for the major works of Dignaga and Dharmakirti. [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham]] is the author of a commentary on this text entitled Tshad ma rig pa'i gter mchan gyis 'grel pa, written at the Sakya monastery of rDzong gsar bkra shis lha rte)".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;arthasya bahudharmasca sarve lingannakalpitam. yo'nubandho'nyasmat vyatireka'dhigamyate.: 'Pramanasamuccaya' : 2:13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rep.routledge.com"/&gt; Sakya pandita secured the place of Dharmakirti's ''pramanavarttika'' as the foundational text on epistemology in Tibet. Later thinkers of the [[Gelug]] school such as Gyeltsap and Kaydrup attempted a synthesis of the two traditions, with varying results. This is because the views of Chapa were mostly that of [[Philosophical realism]], while Sakya pandita was an [[Anti-realism|anti-realist]].&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfus, Georges B. J. Recognizing Reality: Dharmakirti's Philosophy and Its Tibetan Interpretations. page 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bábism'''{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} ({{lang-fa|بابیه}}, ''Babiyye''), also known as the '''Bayání Faith'''&lt;ref&gt;This has been the standard term which the modern followers of Bábism have adopted in order to identify themselves, however it has not been popular within scholarship, modern and contemporary to the religion's founders, the majority of scholars — such as Browne for instance — choosing to refer to the religion as Bábism or the Bábí Faith&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Varnava, Andrekos, Nicholas Coureas, and Marina Elia, eds. The Minorities of Cyprus: Development patterns and the identity of the internal-exclusion. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2009. p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Persian language|Persian]]: {{Lang|fa|بيانى}}, ''Bayání''), is an [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] religion which professes that there is one incorporeal, unknown, and incomprehensible God&lt;ref&gt;[[Báb|Báb, The]] (1848). [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/trans/bayan/bayan.htm ''Persian Bayán''], Exordium.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="browne15"&gt;[[Edward Granville Browne|Browne, E.G.]] [https://www.h-net.org/~bahai/areprint/nk/n-q-p-5.pdf ''Kitab-i-Nuqtatu'l-Kaf''], p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; who manifests his will in an unending series of [[Theophany|theophanies]], called [[Manifestations of God]] (Arabic: {{Lang|ar|ظهور الله}}). It has no more than a few thousand adherents according to current estimates, most of whom are concentrated in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Azali |encyclopedia=Britannica Concise Encyclopedia |volume=2006 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9356264/Azali |accessdate=2006-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barret (2001), p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica |year=1989 |article=Azali Babism |first=Dennis |last=MacEoin |url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v3f2/v3f2a070.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by [[Báb|‘Ali Muhammad Shirazi]] who first assumed the title of [[Bab (gateway)|Báb]] ({{abbr|lit.|literally}}&amp;nbsp;"Gate") from which the religion gets its name, out of the belief that he was the gate to the [[Twelfth Imam]].{{sfn|Saiedi|2008|p=19}} However throughout his ministry his titles and claims underwent much evolution as the Báb progressively outlined his teachings.&lt;ref name="evlambden"&gt;Lambden, Stephen. [http://hurqalya.ucmerced.edu/node/2971 The Evolving Clains and Titles of Mirza `Ali Muhammad Shirazi, the Bab (1819-1850 CE)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1844, Bábism flourished in [[Persian Empire|Persia]] until 1852, then lingered on in exile in the [[Ottoman Empire]], especially [[Cyprus]], as well as underground. An anomaly amongst Islamic messianic movements, the Bábí movement signaled a break with [[Islam]], beginning a new religious system with its own unique laws, teachings, and practices. While Bábism was violently opposed by both clerical and government establishments, it led to the founding of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], whose followers consider the religion founded by the Báb as a predecessor to their own.

==Etymology==
Bábism, a term originating from [[Orientalism|Orientalists]] rather than the followers of the religion, comes from the Perso-Arabic noun ''bab''  (Arabic: {{Lang|ar|باب}}), meaning gate. Additionally, Bayání comes from the [[triliteral root]] B-Y-N which forms a class of words relating to concepts of clarity, differentiation, and separation, including ''[[Bayán]]'' which can refer to explanation, commentary, or exposition as well as the branch of Arabic rhetoric dealing with metaphors and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Espito, John L.

==Beliefs and teachings==
{{Main|Teachings of the Báb}}
The Báb's teachings can be grouped into three broad stages which each have a dominant thematic focus. His earliest teachings are primarily defined by his interpretation of the [[Quran]] and other [[Hadith|Islamic traditions]]. While this interpretive mode continues throughout all three stages of his teachings, a shift takes place where his emphasis moves to the philosophical elucidation and finally to [[legislation|legislative]] pronouncements. In the second philosophical stage, the Báb gives an explanation of the [[metaphysics]] of being and creation, and in the third legislative stage his mystical and historical principles are explicitly united.{{sfn|Saiedi|2008|pp=27–28}}
An analysis of the Báb's writings throughout the three stages shows that all of his teachings were animated by a common principle that had multiple dimensions and forms.{{sfn|Saiedi|2008|p=49}}

===Hidden Imam===
In [[Twelver]] [[Shi'a Islam]]ic belief there were twelve [[Imams]], the last of which, known as [[Imam Mahdi]], who communicated with his followers only through certain representatives.&lt;ref name="browne"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://bahai-library.com/browne_babism |title=Bábism |first=Edward G. |last=Browne |authorlink=E.G. Browne |year=1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Twelver]]'s belief, after the last of these representatives died, the Imam Mahdi went into a state of Occultation; while still alive, he was no longer accessible to his believers.&lt;ref name="browne" /&gt; Shi'a Muslims believe that when the world becomes oppressed, the Imam Mahdi (also termed the [[Al-Qa'im (person)|Qa'im]]) will come out of occultation and restore true religion on Earth before the cataclysmic end of the world and judgement day.&lt;ref name="browne" /&gt;&lt;ref name="amanat1"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Resurgence of Apocalyptic in Modern Islam |first=Abbas |last=Amanat |authorlink=Abbas Amanat |editor=Stephen J. Stein |journal=The Encyclopedia of Apocalypticism |volume=III |year=2000 |pages=230–254 |url=http://bahai-library.com/amanat_resurgence_apocalyptic_islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bábí belief the [[Báb]] is the return of the Imam Mahdi, but the doctrine of the Occultation is implicitly denied; instead the Báb stated that his manifestation was a symbolic return of the Imam, and not the physical reappearance of the Imam Mahdi who had died a thousand years earlier.&lt;ref name="browne" /&gt; In Bábí belief the statements made from previous revelations regarding the Imam Mahdi were set forth in symbols.&lt;ref name="browne" /&gt; The Báb also stated that he was not only the fulfillment of the Shi`i expectations for the Qá'im, but that he also was the beginning of a new prophetic dispensation.&lt;ref name="amanat1" /&gt;

===Resurrection, Judgment Day and cyclical revelation===
The Báb taught that his revelation was beginning an apocalyptic process that was bringing the Islamic dispensation to its cyclical end, and starting a new dispensation.&lt;ref name="amanat1" /&gt; He taught that the terms "resurrection", "Judgement Day", "paradise" and "hell" used in Shi'a prophecies for the end-times are symbolic.{{sfn|Esslemont|1980}} He stated that "Resurrection" means that the appearance of a new revelation, and that "raising of the dead" means the spiritual awakening of those who have stepped away from true religion.{{sfn|Esslemont|1980}} He further stated that "Judgement Day" refers to when a new [[Manifestation of God]] comes, and the acceptance or rejection of those on the Earth.{{sfn|Esslemont|1980}} Thus the Báb taught that with his revelation the [[end times]] ended and the age of resurrection had started and that the end-times were symbolic as the end of the past prophetic cycle.&lt;ref name="amanat1" /&gt;

In the [[Persian Bayán]], the Báb wrote that religious dispensations come in cycles, as the seasons, to renew "pure religion" for humanity.&lt;ref name="amanat1" /&gt; This notion of continuity anticipated future prophetic revelations after the Báb.&lt;ref name="amanat1" /&gt;

===He whom God shall make manifest===
While the Báb claimed a station of revelation, he also claimed no finality for his revelation.&lt;ref name="browne" /&gt; One of the core Bábí teachings is the great Promised One, whom the Báb termed [[He whom God shall make manifest]], promised in the sacred writings of previous religions would soon establish the Kingdom of God on the Earth.&lt;ref name="farah"&gt;{{cite book |title=Islam: Beliefs and Observances |first=Caesar E. |last=Farah |location=Woodbury, NY |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |year=1970 |url=http://bahai-library.com/farah_islam_beliefs_observances}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the books written by the Báb he constantly entreats his believers to follow He whom God shall make manifest when he arrives and not behave like the Muslims who have not accepted his own revelation.&lt;ref name="browne" /&gt;

===Religious law===
The Báb abrogated Islamic law and in the ''[[Persian Bayán]]'' promulgated a system of Bábí law, thus establishing a separate religion distinct from Islam.&lt;ref name="eor2"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hutter |first=Manfred |title=Babis |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion |editor=Lindsay Jones |volume=Vol. 2 |edition=2nd |location=Detroit |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA |year=2005 |pages=727–729}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="walbridge"&gt;{{cite book |title=Essays and Notes on Bábí and Bahá'í History |first=John |last=Walbridge |publisher=H-Bahai Digital Library |location=East Lansing, Michigan |year=2002 |chapter=Chap. 3 |url=http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/bhpapers/vol6/waless/chap3.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the new laws included changing the direction of the [[Qibla]] to the [[Bahá'í pilgrimage#House of the Báb, Shiraz|Báb's house]] in [[Shiraz, Iran]] and changing the calendar to a solar calendar of nineteen months and nineteen days (which became the basis of the [[Bahá'í calendar]]) and prescribing the last month as a month of fasting.&lt;ref name="eor" /&gt;

The Báb also created a large number of rituals and rites which remained largely unpracticed.&lt;ref name="mceoin"&gt;{{cite web |title=Deconstructing and Reconstructing the Shari'a: the Bábí and Bahá'í Solutions to the Problem of Immutability |first=Denis |last=MacEoin |authorlink=Denis MacEoin |url=http://bahai-library.com/maceoin_deconstructing_sharia |accessdate=11 July 2006 |date=23 March 2006 |publisher=bahai-library.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these rituals include the carrying of arms only in times of necessity, the obligatory sitting on chairs, the advocating of the cleanliness displayed by Christians, the non-cruel treatment of animals, the prohibition of beating children severely, the recommendation of the printing of books, even scripture and the prohibition on the study of logic or dead languages.&lt;ref name="mceoin" /&gt; While some statements in the Bayan show tolerance, there are other very harsh regulations in regards to relations with non-believers. For example, non-believers are forbidden to live in five central Iranian provinces, the holy places of previous religions are to be demolished, all non-Bábí books should be destroyed, believers are not to marry or sit in the company of non-believers, and the property of non-believers can be taken from them.&lt;ref name="mceoin" /&gt; Some further ritual include elaborate regulations regarding pilgrimage, fasting, the manufacture of rings, the use of perfume, and the washing and disposal of the dead.&lt;ref name="mceoin" /&gt;

==History==

===Antecedents===
[[Twelver]] Shi'i Muslims regard the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Twelfth Imam]], [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], as the last of the Imams.&lt;ref name="oneworld"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=Shi'ism |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1-85168-184-6 |pages=312–313}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They contend that Muhammad al-Mahdi went into [[The Occultation#Minor Occultation|the Occultation]] in 874 CE, at which time communication between the Imam and the Muslim community could only be performed through mediators called ''Bāb''s "gates" or ''Nā'ib''s "representatives".{{sfn|Saiedi|2008|p=15}} In 940, the fourth ''nā'ib'' claimed that Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi had gone into an indefinite "Grand Occultation", and that he would cease to communicate with the people. According to Twelver belief, the Hidden Imam is alive in the world, but in concealment from his enemies, and that he would only emerge shortly before the [[Last Judgment]]. At that time, acting as [[Al-Qa'im (person)|al-Qā'im]] ("He who will arise"), a messianic figure also known as the [[Mahdi]] ("He who is rightly guided"), the Hidden Imam would start a holy war against evil, would defeat the unbelievers, and would start a reign of justice.{{sfn|Saiedi|2008|p=15}}

In 1830s [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Persia]], [[Sayyid Kazim Rashti]] was the leader of the [[Shaykhism|Shaykhis]], a sect of Twelvers. The Shaykhis were a group expecting the imminent appearance of al-Qāʾim. At the time of Kazim's death in 1843, he had counselled his followers to leave their homes to seek the Lord of the Age whose advent would soon break on the world.&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Islam |year=1999 |article=Bāb |publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV |location=Leiden, The Netherlands |first=A. |last=Bausani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin===
[[File:Room-bab.jpg|thumb|left|The room in the [[Báb]]'s house in [[Shiraz]] where he declared his mission to Mulla Husayn.]]
On 22 May,&lt;ref name="dawn"&gt;{{cite book |first=R. |last=Mehrabkhani |year=1987 |title=Mullá Ḥusayn: Disciple at Dawn |publisher=Kalimat Press |location=Los Angeles, CA, USA |isbn=978-0-933770-37-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wDYnPNwuwtcC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121 |pages=58–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  1844 [[Mullá Husayn]] of [[Boshruyeh]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], a prominent disciple of Sayyid Kāẓim, entered [[Shiraz]] following the instruction by his master to search for al-Qā'im. Soon after he arrived in Shiraz, Mullá Husayn came into contact with the Báb. On the night of May 22, 1844, Mulla Husayn was invited by the Báb to his home; on that night Mullá Husayn told him that he was searching for the possible successor to Sayyid Kāẓim, al-Qā'im, and the Báb told Mullá Husayn privately that he was Sayyid Kāẓim's successor and the bearer of divine knowledge.&lt;ref name="iranica_bab"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]] |year=1989 |article=Bāb, Sayyed `Ali Mohammad Sirazi |first=Dennis |last=MacEoin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the night of the 22nd to dawn of the 23rd, Mulla Husayn became the first to accept the Báb's claims as the gateway to Truth and the initiator of a new prophetic cycle;&lt;ref name="EoI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iranica_bab"/&gt; the Báb had replied in a satisfactory way to all of Mullá Husayn's questions and had written in his presence, with extreme rapidity, a long commentary on the [[Yusuf (sura)|surah of Yusuf]], which has come to be known as the [[Selections from the Writings of the Báb#Qayyúmu'l-Asmá'|Qayyūmu l-Asmā']] and is often considered the Báb's first revealed work,&lt;ref name="EoI" /&gt; though he had before then composed a commentary on [[Al-Fatiha|Surat al-Fatihah]] and [[Surat al-Baqara]].&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Todd. "The Authority of the Feminine and Fatima's Place in an Early Work by the Bab." The Most Learned of the Shi’a: The Institution of the Marja’Taqlid (2007): 94-127.&lt;/ref&gt;  This night and the following day are observed in the Bahá'í Faith as a [[Bahá'í calendar#Holy days|holy day]] since then.

After Mulla Husayn accepted the Báb's claim, the Báb ordered him to wait until 17 others had independently recognized the station of the Báb before they could begin teaching others about the new revelation.

Within five months, seventeen other disciples of Sayyid Kāẓim had independently recognized the Báb as a Manifestation of God.&lt;ref name="BBCHistory"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Time of the Báb |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/bahai/history/bab_2.shtml |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=2 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them was one woman, Zarrin Tāj Baraghāni, a poet, who later received the name of [[Táhirih]] (the Pure). These 18 disciples were later to be known as the [[Letters of the Living]] and were given the task of spreading the new faith across Iran and Iraq.&lt;ref name="iranica_bab" /&gt; The Báb emphasized the spiritual station of these 18 individuals, who along with himself, made the first "Unity" of his religion.{{sfn|Amanat|1989|p=191}}

After his declaration, he soon assumed the title of the Báb. Within a few years the movement spread all over Iran, causing controversy. His claim was at first understood by some of the public at the time to be merely a reference to the Gate of the Hidden Imám of Muhammad, but this understanding he publicly disclaimed. He later proclaimed himself, in the presence of the heir to the Throne of Persia and other notables, to be al-Qā'im. In the Báb's writings, the Báb appears to identify himself as the gate (báb) to Muhammad al-Mahdi and later he begins to explicitly proclaim his station as equivalent to that of the Hidden Imam and a new messenger from God.{{sfn|Saiedi|2008|p=19}} Saiedi states the exalted identity the Báb was claiming was unmistakable, but due to the reception of the people, his writings appear to convey the impression that he is only the gate to the Hidden Twelfth Imam.{{sfn|Saiedi|2008|p=19}} To his circle of early believers, the Báb was equivocal about his exact status, gradually confiding in them that he was not merely a gate to the Hidden Imam, but the Manifestation of the Hidden Imam and al-Qā'im himself.&lt;ref name="EoA"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Resurgence of Apocalyptic in Modern Islam |first=Abbas |last=Amanat |authorlink=Abbas Amanat |editor=Stein, Stephen J. |title=The Encyclopedia of Apocalypticism, vol.

===Spread===
The Báb's message was disseminated by the [[Letters of the Living]] through Iran and southern [[Iraq]]. One of these initial activities were communicated to the West starting January 8, 1845 as an exchange of diplomatic reports concerning the fate of [[Letters of the Living#Mull.C3.A1 .60Al.C3.AD Bast.CC.A3.C3.A1m.C3.AD|Mullá ʿAli-e Bastāmi]], the second Letter.&lt;ref name=momen1981&gt;{{cite book |author=Moojan Momen |authorlink=Moojan Momen |title=The Bábí and Bahá'í religions 1844–1944: some contemporary western accounts |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1S4KAQAAMAAJ |year=1981 |origyear=1977 |publisher=G.

Followups continued until in 1846 he was sentenced by the Ottomans to serve in the naval shipyards at hard labor—the Ottoman ruler refusing to banish him as it would be "difficult to control his activities and prevent him spreading his false ideas."&lt;ref name=momen1981/&gt; [[Quddús]] and other early followers then were sent on to Shiraz to begin public presentations of the new religion. Indeed various activities the Báb initiated were devolved to various Letters of the Living like preaching activities and answering questions from the community.&lt;ref name="MDM"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=MacEoin, Denis M |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]] |volume=Online |date=15 December 1988 |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/babism-index |accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular as these first public activities multiplied opposition by the Islamic clergy arose and prompted the Governor of Shiraz to order the Báb's arrest. The Báb, upon hearing of the arrest order, left [[Bushehr]] for Shiraz in June 1845 and presented himself to the authorities. This series of events become the first public account of the new religion in the West when they were published Nov 1, 1845 in ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref name="States1977"&gt;{{cite book |author=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States |title=World order |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sUYlAQAAIAAJ |accessdate=20 August 2013 |year=1977 |publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was also carried from Nov 15 by the [[Literary Gazette]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UcdLAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA757#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false "Mahometan Schism"], ''Literary Gazette'', Nov. 15, 1845, p. 757, 1st column, below middle&lt;/ref&gt; which was subsequently echoed widely.&lt;ref&gt;for example see:

The Báb was released and departed for [[Isfahan]]. There, many came to see him at the house of the imám jum'ih, head of the local clergy, who became sympathetic. After an informal gathering where the Báb debated the local clergy and displayed his speed in producing instantaneous verses, his popularity soared.{{sfn|Amanat|1989|p=257}}  After the death of the Governor of Isfahan, [[Manouchehr Khan Gorji]], an [[Iranian Georgians|Iranian Georgian]],&lt;ref&gt;Cheyne, ''The Reconciliation of Races and Religions'', 29.&lt;/ref&gt; who had become his supporter, pressure from the clergy of the province led to the Shah, [[Mohammad Shah Qajar]], ordering the Báb to [[Tehran]] in January, 1847.{{sfn|Amanat|1989|p=258}} After spending several months in a camp outside Tehran, and before the Báb could meet the Shah, the Prime Minister sent the Báb to [[Tabriz]] in the northwestern corner of the country, and later [[Maku, Iran|Maku]] and [[Chehriq]], where he was confined.&lt;ref name="iranica_bab" /&gt; During his confinement, he was said to have impressed his jailers with his patience and dignity.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} Communication between the Báb and his followers was not completely severed but was quite difficult, and more responsibilities were devolved to the ''Letters''&lt;ref name="MDM"/&gt; as he was not able to elucidate his teachings to the public.&lt;ref name="iranica_babism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]] |year=2011 |article=Babism |first=Dennis |last=MacEoin}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Bábí teachings now mostly spread by his followers, they faced increasing persecution themselves.&lt;ref name="iranica_babism" /&gt;

The role played by [[Táhirih]] in [[Karbala|Karbalāʾ]] was particularly significant. She began an effort of innovation in religion based on her station as a Letter of the Living and the incarnation of [[Fatimah]]. In his early teachings, the [[Báb]] emphasized observing [[Sharia]] and extraordinary acts of piety. However, his claim of being the Bāb, i.e. the authority direct from God, was in conflict with this more conservative position of supporting Sharia. Táhirih innovated an advance in the understanding of the priority of the Báb's station above that of Islamic Sharia by wedding the concept of the Bāb’s overriding religious authority with ideas originating in [[Shaykhism]] pointing to an age after outward conformity. She seems to have made this connection circa 1262/1846 even before the Bāb himself. The matter was taken up by the community at large at the [[Conference of Badasht]].&lt;ref name="MDM"/&gt;

This conference was one of the most important events of the Bábí movement when in 1848 its split from Islam and Islamic law was made clear.&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt; Three key individuals who attended the conference were [[Bahá'u'lláh]], [[Quddús]], and Táhirih. Táhirih, during the conference, was able to persuade many of the others about the Bábí split with Islam based on the station of the Báb and an age after outward conformity. She appeared at least once during the conference in public without a [[chador|veil]], heresy within the Islamic world of that day, signalling the split.&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt;  During this same month the Báb was brought [[Báb#Trial|to trial]] in Tabriz and made his claim to be the [[Mahdi]] public to the Crown Prince and the Shi'a clergy.&lt;ref name="PSmith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=Báb |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1-85168-184-6 |pages=55–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1848 the increased fervour of the Bábís and the clerical opposition had led to a number of confrontations between the Bábís and their government and clerical establishment.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt;  After the death of [[Mohammad Shah Qajar]], the shah of Iran, a series of armed struggles and uprisings broke out in the country, including at Tabarsi.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt; These confrontations all resulted in Bábí massacres; Bahá'í authors give an estimate of 20,000 Bábís killed from 1844 to present, with most of the deaths occurring during the first 20 years.&lt;ref name="MacEoin 1983 pp. 219–55"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=MacEoin |first=Denis |authorlink=Denis MacEoin |title=From Babism to Baha'ism: Problems of Militancy, Quietism, and Conflation in the Construction of a Religion |journal=Religion |volume=13 |issue=1983 |pages=219–55 |year=1983 |url=http://bahai-library.com/maceoin_babism_militancy |doi=10.1016/0048-721X(83)90022-2 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Professor of Islamic Studies [[Denis MacEoin]] studied documented deaths, both for individuals and for round figures, from Bábí, Bahá'í, European, and Iranian sources, and confirmed at most two to three thousand.&lt;ref name="MacEoin 1983 pp. 219–55"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MacEoin 1983 pp. 68–72"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=MacEoin |first=Denis |authorlink=Denis MacEoin |title=A Note on the Numbers of Babi and Baha'i Martyrs |journal=Baha'i Studies Bulletin |volume=02 |issue=3–1983 |pages=68–72 |year=1983 |url= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacEoin 1983 pp. 84–88"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=MacEoin |first=Denis |authorlink=Denis MacEoin |title=A Note on the Numbers of Babi and Baha'i Martyrs in Iran |journal=Baha'i Studies Bulletin |volume=02 |issue=2–1983 |pages=84–88 |year=1983 |url= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that he could not find evidence for any higher figures.&lt;ref name="MacEoin 1983 pp. 68–72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MacEoin 1983 pp. 84–88"/&gt; Supporters of the Bábís paint their struggle as basically defensive in nature; Shi'i writers on the other hand point to this period as proof of the subversive nature of Bábísm. MacEoin has pointed out that the Bábís did arm themselves, upon the Báb's instructions, and originally intended an uprising, but that their eventual clashes with state forces were defensive, and not considered an offensive jihad. In mid-1850 a new prime-minister, [[Amir Kabir]], was convinced that the Bábí movement was a threat and ordered the [[execution of the Báb]] which was followed by the killings of many Bábís.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt;

====Fort Tabarsi====
{{Main|Battle of Fort Tabarsi}}
Of the conflicts between the Bábís and the establishment, the first and best known took place in [[Mazandaran Province|Māzandarān]] at the remote shrine of [[Shaykh Tabarsi]], about 22 kilometres southeast of Bārfarush (modern [[Babol]]). From October 1848 until May 1849, around 300 Bábís (later rising to 600), led by Quddús and Mullá Husayn, defended themselves against the attacks of local villagers and members of the Shah's army under the command of Prince Mahdi Qoli Mirza.&lt;ref name="PSmith2"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=Tabarsi, Shaykh |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1-85168-184-6 |page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were, after being weakened through attrition and starvation, subdued through false promises of safety, and put to death or sold into slavery.&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PSmith2"/&gt;

====Zanjan upheaval====
The revolt at the fortress of ʿAli Mardan Khan in [[Zanjan Province|Zanjan]] in northwest Iran was by far the most violent of all the conflicts. It was headed by Mullā Muhammad ‘Ali Zanjani, called [[Hujjat]], and also lasted seven or eight months (May 1850 – January 1851). The Bábí community in the city had swelled to around 3000 after the conversion of one of the town's religious leaders to the Bábí movement.&lt;ref name="PSmith3"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=Zanjan |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1-85168-184-6 |pages=368–369}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict was preceded by years of growing tension between the leading Islamic clergy and the new rising Bábí leadership. The city governor ordered that the city be divided into two sectors, with hostilities starting soon thereafter.&lt;ref name="PSmith3"/&gt; The Bábís faced resistance against a large number of regular troops, and led to the death of several thousand Bábís.&lt;ref name="PSmith3"/&gt; After Hujjat was killed, and the Bábí numbers being greatly reduced, the Bábís surrendered in January 1851 and were massacred by the army.&lt;ref name="PSmith3"/&gt;

====Nayriz upheaval====
Meanwhile, a serious but less protracted struggle was waged against the government at [[Neyriz]] in [[Fars Province|Fars]] by Yahya Vahid Darabi of Nayriz. Vahid had converted around 1500 people in the community and had thus caused tensions with the authorities which led to an armed struggle in a nearby fort.&lt;ref name="PSmith4"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=Nayriz |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1-85168-184-6 |page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bábís resisted attacks by the town's governor as well as further reinforcements. After being given a truce offer on 17 June 1850, Vahid told his followers to give up their positions, which led to Vahid and the Bábís being killed; the Bábí section of the town was also plundered, and the property of the remaining Bábís seized.&lt;ref name="PSmith4"/&gt; Later, in March 1853 the governor of the city was killed by the Bábís. These further events led to a second armed conflict near the city where the Bábís once again resisted troop attacks until November 1853, when a massacre of Bábís happened, with their women being enslaved.&lt;ref name="PSmith4"/&gt;

===After the execution of the Báb===
{{See also|Execution of the Báb}}
[[File:Haifa Shrine and Port.jpg|thumb|262px|The [[Shrine of the Báb]] in [[Haifa]]]]
The revolts in Zanjan and Nayriz were in progress when in 1850 the Báb, with one of his disciples, was brought from his prison at Chehriq to Tabriz and publicly shot in front of the citadel. The body, after being exposed for some days, was recovered by the Bábís and conveyed to a shrine near [[Tehran]], whence it was ultimately removed to [[Haifa]], where it is now [[Shrine of the Báb|enshrined]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}&lt;ref name="gpb_18"&gt;{{cite book |first=Effendi |last=Shoghi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=978-0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-19.html |pages=273–289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most western scholars who reviewed the Faith of the Báb after 1860 saw it as a way of letting in Western and Christian ideals into "a closed and rigid Moslem system" and giving the Báb himself sometimes less or more credit for being authentic in the process.&lt;ref name=momen1981/&gt; However some went further. In 1866 British diplomat Robert Grant Watson (b. 8 February 1834, d. 28 October 1892) published a history of the first 58 years of the 19th century of Persia&lt;ref name="WatsonBLO"&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/watson_history_persia_1858 A History of Persia from the Beginning of the Nineteenth Century to the Year 1858] by Robert Grant Watson, pages 347–352, 385–393, 407–410, London: Smith, Elder and Co., 1866&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/ahistorypersiaf00grangoog#page/n363/mode/2up A History of Persia from the Beginning of the Nineteenth Century to the Year 1858] by Robert Grant Watson, 1866.&lt;/ref&gt; and would serve in several diplomatic capacities&lt;ref&gt;see: * [[María Luz Incident]]
* [https://archive.org/details/cu31924005216811 The diplomatic service]; an abstract and examination of evidence taken by the Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1870 (1871)&lt;/ref&gt; Watson summarizes the impact of the Báb in Persia:
{{quote|Bábism, though at present a proscribed religion in Persia, is far from being extinct, or even declining, and the Báb may yet contest with Mahomed(sic) the privilege of being regarded as the real prophet of the faithful. Bábism in its infancy was the cause of a greater sensation than that even which was produced by the teaching of Jesus, if we may judge from the account of [[Josephus]] of the [[Historicity of Jesus#Josephus|first days of Christianity]].&lt;ref name="WatsonBLO"/&gt;}}
Latter commentators also noted these kinds of views: [[Ernest Renan]],&lt;ref&gt;*[https://books.google.com/books?id=V7MLR8OBo_YC&amp;lpg=PA353&amp;ots=W3l6_BfbhA&amp;pg=PA299#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Origins of Christianity: The apostles], Volume 2 of The Origins of Christianity, by Ernest Renan, Publisher Carleton, 1866,* [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1898-09-11/ed-1/seq-22.pdf Under "Some New Books", "vi"], ''The Sun'', New York New York, September 11, 1898, p. 22, 5th column near bottom to 6th column top&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Greenleaf Bulfinch,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924031235546#page/n141/mode/2up/search/babism ''Babism''],  Studies in the evidences of Christianity, 1869, pp. 129 – 140&lt;/ref&gt; son of [[Charles Bulfinch]], and others.&lt;ref name="Margaret"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dean-Deibert |first=Margaret |title=Early Journalistic Reactions to the Bahá'í Faith: 1845–1912 |journal=World Order |issue=Summer 1978 |pages=17–27 |date=1978 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next two years comparatively little was heard of the Bábís. The Bábís became polarized with one group speaking of violent retribution against [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]], while the other, under the leadership of Baha’u’llah, looked to rebuild relationships with the government and advance the Babí cause by persuasion and the example of virtuous living.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Xl9py3z5w The Attempted Assassination of Nasir al Din Shah in 1852: Millennialism and violence], by [[Moojan Momen]], 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/momen_attempted_assassination_shah The Attempted Assassination of Nasir al Din Shah in 1852: Millennialism and Violence], by [[Moojan Momen]], 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Religio 12-1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Momen |first=Moojan |authorlink=Moojan Momen |title=Millennialism and Violence: The Attempted Assassination of Nasir al-Din Shah of Iran by the Babis in 1852 |journal=Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=57–82 |date=August 2008 |jstor=10.1525/nr.2008.12.1.57 |doi=10.1525/nr.2008.12.1.57}}&lt;!--| accessdate = April 16, 2013 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The militant group of Babis was between thirty and seventy persons, only a small number of the total Babi population of perhaps 100,000. Their meetings appear to have come under the control of a "Husayn Jan", an emotive and magnetic figure who obtained a high degree of personal devotion to himself from the group. Meanwhile Tahirih and Baha'u'llah, visible leaders of the community previously, were removed from the scene – Tahirih by arrest and in the case of Baha'u'llah an invitation to go on pilgrimage to Karbila. On August 15, 1852, three from this small splinter group, acting on their own initiative, attempted to assassinate [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] as he was returning from the chase to his palace at [[Niavaran|Niavarān]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=94}} Notwithstanding the assassins' claim that they were working alone, the entire Bábí community was blamed, and a slaughter of several thousand Bábís followed, starting on the 31 August 1852 with some thirty Bábís, including Táhirih. Dr [[Jakob Eduard Polak]], then the Shah's physician,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=POLAK, Jakob Eduard |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]] |volume=Online |date=December 15, 2009 |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/polak-jakob-eduard |accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an eye-witness to her execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Polak |first=Jakob Eduard |title=Persien |chapter=Martyrdom of Tahirih (Dr Jakob Eduard Polak) |chapterurl=http://www.paintdrawer.co.uk/david/folders/Research/Bahai/Tahirih/Martyrdom%20of%20Tahirih%20(Dr%20Jakob%20Eduard%20Polak).htm |publisher=F.A.

===Succession===
{{Main|Bahá'í/Bábí split}}

In most of his prominent writings, the Báb alluded to a Promised One, most commonly referred to as "[[He whom God shall make manifest]]", and that he himself was "but a ring upon the hand of Him Whom God shall make manifest." Within 20 years of the Báb's death, over 25 people claimed to be the Promised One, most significantly [[Bahá'u'lláh]].

Shortly before the Báb's execution, a follower of the Báb, Abd al-Karim, brought to the Báb's attention the necessity to appoint a successor; thus the Báb wrote a certain number of tablets which he gave to Abd al-Karim to deliver to Subh-i Azal and Bahá'u'lláh.{{sfn|Amanat|1989|p=384}}  These tablets were later interpreted by both [[Azali]]s and Bahá'ís as proof of the Báb's delegation of leadership.{{sfn|Amanat|1989|p=384}} Some sources state that the Báb did this at the suggestion of Bahá'u'lláh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=`Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink=`Abdu'l-Bahá |editor=Browne, E.G.

All of this lends credence to the Bahá'í claim that the Báb appointed Subh-i Azal the head of the Bábí Faith so as to divert attention away from Bahá'u'lláh, while allowing Bábís to visit Bahá'u'lláh and consult with him freely, and allowing Bahá'u'lláh to write Bábís easily and freely.

Subh-i Azal's leadership was controversial. He generally absented himself from the Bábí community spending his time in [[Baghdad]] in hiding and disguise; and even went so far as to publicly disavow allegiance to the Báb on several occasions.&lt;ref name="cole_bio"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Brief Biography of Baha'u'llah |last=Cole |first=Juan |accessdate=22 June 2006 |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahabio.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iranica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]] |year=1989 |article=Azali Babism |first=Dennis |last=MacEoin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Barrett p. 246"&gt;{{cite book |last=Barrett |first=David |title=The New Believers |publisher=Cassell &amp; Co |year=2001 |location=London, UK |isbn=978-0-304-35592-1 |page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subh-i Azal gradually alienated himself from a large proportion of the Bábís who started to give their alliance to other claimants.&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt; During the time that both Bahá'u'lláh and Subh-i-Azal were in Baghdad, since Subh-i Azal remained in hiding, Bahá'u'lláh performed much of the daily administration of the Bábí affairs.&lt;ref name="cole_bio"/&gt;

[[Bahá'u'lláh]] claimed that in 1853, while a prisoner in Tehran, he was visited by a "[[Maid of Heaven]]", which symbolically marked the beginning of his mission as a Messenger of God. Ten years later in Baghdad, he made his first public declaration to be He whom God shall make manifest to a small number of followers, and in 1866 he made the claim public.&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt;  Bahá'u'lláh's claims threatened Subh-i Azal's position as leader of the religion since it would mean little to be leader of the Bábís if "Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest" were to appear and start a new religion.&lt;ref name="cole_bio"/&gt; Subh-i-Azal responded by making his own claims, but his attempt to preserve the traditional Bábísm was largely unpopular, and his followers became the minority.&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt;
[[File:Bahai community.jpg|260px|left|thumbnail|A Baha'i Community (1910)]]
[[File:Iranian Azali community.jpg or Isfahan,Iran Azali community.jpg|240px|thumbnail|An Azali Community in Iran]]
Eventually Bahá'u'lláh was recognized by the vast majority of Bábís as "He whom God shall make manifest" and his followers began calling themselves Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="cole_bio"/&gt; By 1908, there were probably from half a million to a million Bahá'ís, and at most only a hundred followers of Subh-i Azal.

Subh-i Azal died in [[Famagusta]], [[Cyprus]] in 1912, and his followers are known as [[Azali]]s or Azali Bábis. MacEoin notes that after the deaths of those Azali Babis who were active in the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]], the Azali form of Babism entered a stagnation from which it has not recovered as there is no acknowledged leader or central organization.&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt;

Current estimates of Azalis are that there are no more than a few thousand.&lt;ref name = "Barrett p. 246"/&gt; The ''World Religion Database'' estimated 7.3 million Bahá'ís in 2010 and stated: "The Baha'i Faith is the only religion to have grown faster in every United Nations region over the past 100 years than the general population; Baha'i [sic] was thus the fastest-growing religion between 1910 and 2010, growing at least twice as fast as the population of almost every UN region."{{sfn|Johnson|Grim|2013|pp=59–62}} Bahá'í sources since 1991 usually estimate the worldwide Bahá'í population at "above 5 million".&lt;ref name="whoare"&gt;{{Cite news |last=International Community |first=Bahá'í | author-link = Bahá'í International Community |title=How many Bahá'ís are there? |magazine=The Bahá'ís |page=14 |year=1992 |url=http://www.bahai.com/thebahais/pg14.htm |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Statistics |author=Bahá'í International Community |authorlink=Bahá'í International Community |publisher=Bahá'í International Community |year=2010 |accessdate=March 5, 2010 |url=http://news.bahai.org/media-information/statistics/}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Bahá'í statistics]].

==Writings==
:''See also [[Báb#Writings|Writings of the Báb]]
The Báb's major writings include the [[Selections from the Writings of the Báb#Qayyúmu'l-Asmá'|Qayyúmu'l-Asmá']] (a commentary on the [[Yusuf (sura)|Sura of Joseph]]), and the [[Persian Bayán]], which the Bábís saw as superseding the [[Qur'an]]. The latter has been translated into [[French language|French]]; only portions exist in [[English language|English]]. Unfortunately, most of the writings of the Báb have been lost. The Báb himself stated they exceeded five hundred thousand verses in length; the Qur'an, in contrast, is 6300 verses in length. If one assumes 25 verses per page, that would equal 20,000 pages of text.{{sfn|MacEoin|1992|p=15}} [[Nabíl-i-A`zam|Nabíl-i-Zarandí]], in ''[[The Dawn-Breakers]]'', mentions nine complete commentaries on the Qur'an, revealed during the Báb's imprisonment at [[Maku, Iran|Máh-Kú]], which have been lost without a trace.{{sfn|MacEoin|1992|p=88}} Establishing the true text of the works that are still extant, as already noted, is not always easy, and some texts will require considerable work. Others, however, are in good shape; several of the Báb's major works are available in the handwriting of his trusted secretaries.{{sfn|MacEoin|1992|pp=12–15}}

Most works were revealed in response to specific questions by Bábís. This is not unusual; the genre of the letter has been a venerable medium for composing authoritative texts as far back as Paul of Tarsus. Three-quarters of the chapters of the New Testament are letters, were composed to imitate letters, or contain letters within them.&lt;ref&gt;On letters as a medium of the composition of the New Testament, see Norman Perrin, ''The New Testament: An Introduction, Proclamation and Parenesis, Myth and History'' (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovitch, 1974), 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the Báb revealed works very rapidly by chanting them in the presence of a secretary and witnesses.

The Archives Department at the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] currently holds about 190 [[Tablet (religious)|Tablets]] of the Báb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Unpublished letter from the Universal House of Justice |title=Numbers and Classifications of Sacred Writings Texts |url=http://bahai-library.com/uhj_numbers_sacred_writings |accessdate=16 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excerpts from several principal works have been published in the only English language compilation of the Báb's writings: ''[[Selections from the Writings of the Báb]]''. Denis MacEoin, in his ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', gives a description of many works; much of the following summary is derived from that source. In addition to major works, the Báb revealed numerous letters to his wife and followers, many prayers for various purposes, numerous commentaries on verses or chapters of the Qur'an, and many khutbihs or sermons (most of which were never delivered). Many of these have been lost; others have survived in compilations.{{sfn|MacEoin|1992|pp=15–40}}

==Criticism==
[[Denis MacEoin]] considers Bábí law as a "mishmash of rules and regulations that at times are little more than mere whimsy, revolving around some of the Bab's own obsessions about cleanliness, polite behaviour, and elegance. It is a shari'a, but not in any practical sense. Certainly, it does not seem to be going anywhere...Here and there we find indications that the Bab had been impressed by Europeans and that he wanted his followers to emulate them."&lt;ref name="mceoin" /&gt; He further states: "One comes away from the Bayan with a strong sense that very little of this is to be taken seriously. It is a form of a game, never actually intended to be put into practice, much in the same way that whole sections of the Bab's later books don't, in fact, mean anything very much, but are elaborate exercises in interesting things you can do with Arabic roots. Or the way so many of the Bab's early writings, described as tafsirs on this or that sura of the Qur'an, are really not commentaries at all."&lt;ref name="mceoin" /&gt; He further criticizes the Babi laws stating "The average Babi could hardly hope to afford the three diamonds, four yellow rubies, six emeralds, and six red rubies that he was expected to give to the Babi Messiah, let alone find time to observe all the rules and regulations laid down in the book. For all that, the Babi shari'a made an impact."&lt;ref name="mceoin" /&gt; Nader Saiedi states that the severe laws of the Bayán were never meant to be put in practice, because their implementation depended on the appearance of He whom God shall make manifest, while at the same time all of the laws would be abrogated unless the Promised One would reaffirm them. Saiedi concludes that these can then only have a strategic and symbolic meaning, and were meant to break through traditions and to focus the Báb’s followers on obedience to He whom God shall make manifest.{{sfn|Saiedi|2008|pp=363–367}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7578">{{Descartes}}
'''Cartesianism''' is the [[philosophical]] and [[Science|scientific]] system of [[René Descartes]] and its subsequent development by other seventeenth century thinkers, most notably [[Nicolas Malebranche]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cartesianism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes is often regarded as the first thinker to emphasize the use of reason to develop the [[natural sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grosholz |first=Emily |title=Cartesian method and the problem of reduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=2EtAVLU1eIAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1 |ISBN=0-19-824250-6 |year=1991 |publisher=Oxford University Press |quote=But contemporary debate has tended to...understand [Cartesian method] merely as the 'method of doubt'...I want to define Descartes's method in broader terms...to trace its impact on the domains of [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] as well as [[metaphysics]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=November 2017}} For him, the philosophy was a thinking system that embodied all knowledge, and expressed it in this way:&lt;ref name="Preface"&gt;{{cite web |last=Descartes |first=René | url=http://www.classicallibrary.org/descartes/principles/preface.htm| title=Letter of the Author to the French Translator of the Principles of Philosophy serving for a preface|author2=Translator John Veitch| accessdate=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartesians view the mind as being wholly separate from the corporeal body. Sensation and the perception of reality are thought to be the source of untruth and illusions, with the only reliable truths to be had in the existence of a metaphysical mind. Such a mind can perhaps interact with a physical body, but it does not exist in the body, nor even in the same physical plane as the body. The question of how mind and body interact would be a persistent difficulty for Descartes and his followers, with different Cartesians providing different answers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cartesianism {{!}} philosophy|url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/Cartesianism|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date = 2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ontology ==
Descartes held that all existence consists in three distinct substances, each with its own essence:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* matter, possessing extension in three dimensions
* mind, possessing self-conscious thought
* God, possessing necessary existence

== Epistemology ==
Descartes brought the question of how reliable knowledge may be obtained ([[epistemology]]) to the fore of philosophical enquiry. Many consider this to be Descartes' most lasting influence on the history of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Concise Encyclopedia of Western Philosophy and Philosophers|last = Ree|first = Jonathan|publisher = Routledge|year = 1991|isbn = 0415078830|location = London|pages = 78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartesianism is a form of [[rationalism]] because it holds that scientific knowledge can be derived ''[[A priori and a posterior knowledge|a priori]]'' from '[[Innatism|innate ideas]]' through [[deductive reasoning]]. Thus Cartesianism is opposed to both Aristotelianism and [[empiricism]], with their emphasis on sensory experience as the source of all knowledge of the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For Descartes, the faculty of deductive reason is supplied by God and may therefore be trusted because God would not deceive us.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Concise Encyclopedia of Western Philosophy and Philosophers|last = Ree|first = Jonathan|publisher = Routledge|year = 1991|isbn = 0415078830|location = London|pages = 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Rise of Modern Philosophy|last = Kelly|first = Anthony|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2006|isbn = 9780198752769|location = Oxford|pages = 123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical dispersal==
In the [[Netherlands]], where Descartes had lived for a long time, Cartesianism was a doctrine popular mainly among university professors and lecturers. In [[Germany]] the influence of this doctrine was not relevant and followers of Cartesianism in the German-speaking border regions between these countries (e.g., the [[iatromathematicians|iatromathematician]] [[Yvo Gaukes]] from East Frisia) frequently chose to publish their works in the Netherlands. In [[France]], it was very popular, and gained influence also among [[Jansenism|Jansenists]] such as [[Antoine Arnauld]], though there also, as in Italy, it became opposed by the Church. In [[Italy]], the doctrine failed to make inroads, probably since Descartes' works were placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' in 1663.&lt;ref name="copleston"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Copleston |first=Frederick Charles |authorlink=Frederick Copleston |title=A History of Philosophy, Volume 4 |publisher=Continuum International |date=2003 |page=174 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZtDGtgARkzMC&amp;pg=PA174 |isbn=978-0-8264-6898-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England]], because of religious and other reasons, Cartesianism was not widely accepted.&lt;ref name="copleston"/&gt; Though [[Henry More]] was initially attracted to the doctrine, his own changing attitudes toward Descartes mirrored those of the country: "quick acceptance, serious examination with accumulating ambivalence, final rejection."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Lennon |first=Thomas M. |author2=John M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4374">'''Claudio Ciborra''' (1951 – 13 February 2005) was an Italian [[organizational theory|organizational theorist]],&lt;ref&gt;Donald A. Mankin (1996) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=td1ReW6TRhoC&amp;pg=PA13 Teams and Technology: Fulfilling the Promise of the New Organization]''. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and Professor of Information Systems and PWC Chair in Risk Management in the [[London School of Economics]]. Prior to the LSE, he was professor at the [[Theseus International Management Institute]].

== Work ==
Ciborra was an original thinker in his field: the [[Social Study of Information Systems]]. His contribution ranks among that of the top names in this and related fields such as [[Shoshana Zuboff]], Wanda Orlikowski, Steve Barley, Lynn Markus, [[Lucas Introna]], [[Jannis Kallinikos]], Geoff Walsham, Rob Kling, Robey, Chrisanthi Avgerou and Richard Boland. He collaborated widely, including with such scholars as Ole Hanseth ([[University of Oslo]]) and Giovan Francesco Lanzara ([[University of Bologna]]).

Ciborra contributed to the following areas.
*The relationship between technology and organizations 
*Transaction cost theory and IS 
*Organizational learning, bricolage and improvisation 
*IS infrastructures.

===Improvisation===
Ciborra goes beyond the typical characterisation of improvisation as situated, pragmatic and contingent action by referring to the existential condition of the actor (his “moods feelings, affectations and fundamental attunement with the situation”). By eschewing the notion of the actor as a “robot” adapting to changing circumstances he reintroduces the personal human aspects that shape our encounters with the world and shows how our affectations define the situation at hand and so shape action.

===Bricolage===
{{main article|Bricolage#Information systems}}
As expounded by Ciborra, bricolage can be seen as the constant re-ordering of people and resources, the constant "trying out" and experimentation that is the true hallmark of organisational change. But bricolage is not a random trying out: Ciborra emphasises that it is a trying out based on leveraging the world "as defined by the situation".

===Hospitality (''xenia'')===
Hospitality is Claudio's attempt to present an alternative conception of how IT/IS is implemented. He rejects the scientific explanations of IS implementation (planning, design, goals, targets, methods, procedures) and instead views technology as an alien embodying and exemplifying its alien culture and affordances. Successful implementation is achieved when the "host" organisation (i.e. that implementing the technology) is able to extend courtesy and to absorb and appropriate/assimilate the alien culture where it offers advantages such as new ways of working. Claudio also warns that the host must beware that the guest can quickly become hostile.

===Crisis===
Ciborra claims that much of the IS and IT world (particularly their strategic management, marketing, academia and training organisations) are in crisis. He teaches that this is because IS and IT are treated as scientific disciplines when in fact they are social disciplines and hence thinking about them is based in an inappropriate paradigm which we might call "Positivism" (although Ciborra does not use this term).

===Formative context===
Ciborra drew on the work of [[Roberto Unger]] and showed how IS can embody and so be enacted as [[Formative Context]].
*Drift
*Caring
*The Platform Organisation

===Gestell===
Ciborra analyses Information System infrastructure using Heidegger's concept of [[Gestell]].

In [[folk magic]] and mythology, '''crossroads''' may represent a location "between the worlds" and, as such, a site where [[supernatural]] spirits can be contacted and [[paranormal]] events can take place. Symbolically, it can mean a locality where two realms touch and therefore represents [[liminality]], a place literally "neither here nor there", "betwixt and between".

==Ancient religions==
An 11th-century homily called '''''[[De Falsis Deis]]''''' tells us that Mercury or Odin were honored on crossroads.

:53. Sum man eac wæs gehaten Mercurius on life, se wæs swyðe facenfull
:54. And, ðeah full snotorwyrde, swicol on dædum and on leasbregdum. Ðone
:55. macedon þa hæðenan be heora getæle eac heom to mæran gode and æt wega
:56. gelætum him lac offrodon oft and gelome þurh deofles lare and to heagum
:57. beorgum him brohton oft mistlice loflac.''&lt;ref&gt;The Old English text is reproduced here from The Cambridge Old English Reader by Richard Marsden, pp. 205–208.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern English text gives:
"There was also a man called Mercury, he was very crafty and deceitful in deed and trickeries, though his speech was fully plausible. The heathens made him a renowned god for themselves; at crossroads they offered sacrifices to him frequently and they often erringly brought praise-offerings to hilltops, all through the devil’s teaching. This false god was honored among the heathens in that day, and he is also called by the name Odin in the Danish manner."

==Hoodoo==
In [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|conjure, rootwork, and hoodoo]], a form of [[African American]] magical spirituality,  in order to acquire facility at various manual and body skills, such as playing a [[musical instrument]], throwing [[dice]], or [[dancing]], one may attend upon a crossroads a certain number of times, either at [[midnight]] or just before [[dawn]], and one will meet a "black man," whom some call the [[Devil]], who will bestow upon one the desired skills. In the [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] tradition, [[Papa Legba]] is the [[Loa|lwa]] of crossroads.

==Blues songs==
In Western folk mythology, a crossroads can be used to summon a demon in order to broker a supernatural deal.  This legend can be seen in many stories.  For example, in 1926's ''[[Faust (1926 film)|Faust]]'', the title character summons the demon [[Mephistopheles]] at a crossroads.  In the U.S. television show [[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|''Supernatural'']], crossroads demons are a recurring [[plot device]].

Some 20th-century [[blues]] songs, such as ''Sold It to the Devil'' by Black Spider Dumpling (John D. Twitty), may be about making a deal with the devil at the crossroads. Many modern listeners believe that the premier song about [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]-selling at a crossroads is "[[Cross Road Blues]]" by [[Robert Johnson]].  However, the song's lyrics merely describe a man trying to [[Hitchhiking|hitchhike]]; the sense of foreboding has been interpreted as the singer's apprehension of finding himself, a young black man in the 1920s deep south, alone after dark and at the mercy of passing motorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Litwack |first=Leon F |title=Trouble in Mind: Black Southerners in the Age of Jim Crow |publisher=New York: Vintage Books |year=1998 |pages=410–411}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of selling one's soul for instrumental skills predates the American South as several virtuoso classical musicians such as [[Paganini]]{{cn|date=October 2014}} had stories told about selling their soul for music prowess (and that story may reference back to medieval troubadour doing something similar). The motif of selling one's soul for guitar power has become a staple of both rock and metal guitarists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2012/apr/16/crossroads/ |title=Radiolab, April 16, 2012: Features |author=Jad Abumrad |work=Radiolab.org |year=2012 |accessdate=27 April 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brazilian mythology==
Crossroads are very important both in [[Brazilian mythology]] (related to the [[Headless Mule|headless mule]], the [[devil]], the [[Bestial beast|Besta Fera]] and the Brazilian version of the [[werewolf]]) and [[Afro-Brazilian religions|religions]] (as the favourite place for the manifestation of "left-hand" entities such as [[Eshu|Exu]]s and where to place offerings to the [[Orisha]]s). Eshu and Legba derive from the same African deity, although they are viewed in markedly different manners among traditions. For example, Papa Legba is considered by Haitian Vodou practitioners to be closest to [[Saint Peter]], although in Brazilian [[Quimbanda]] it is not uncommon to see Exu closely associated with demonic entities such as [[Lucifer]], clad in Mephistophelean attire and bearing a trident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Canizares |first=Baba Raul |title=Santeria and the Orisha of the Crossroads. |publisher=New York: Original Publications |year=2000 |pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burial==
In the UK there was a tradition of [[burial#Burial at cross-roads|burying at crossroads]] criminals and [[suicide]]s. This may have been due to the crossroads marking the boundaries of the settlement coupled with a desire to bury those outside of the law outside the settlement, or that the many roads would confuse the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba25/BA25FEAT.HTML |title=British Archaeology, no 25, June 1997: Features |author=Robert Halliday |work=britarch.ac.uk |year=2008 |accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Taoism}}
'''Daoist meditation''' refers to the traditional [[meditative]] practices associated with the Chinese philosophy and religion of [[Daoism]], including concentration, mindfulness, contemplation, and visualization. Techniques of Daoist meditation are historically interrelated with [[Buddhist meditation]], for instance, 6th-century Daoists developed ''guan'' 觀 "observation" insight meditation from [[Tiantai]] Buddhist ''[[anapanasati]]'' "mindfulness of breath" practices. 

[[Traditional Chinese medicine]] and [[Chinese martial arts]] have adapted certain Daoist meditative techniques. Some examples are [[Daoyin]] "guide and pull" breathing exercises, [[Neidan]] "internal alchemy" techniques, [[Neigong]] "internal skill" practices, [[Qigong]] breathing exercises, [[Zhan zhuang]] "standing like a post" techniques. The opposite direction of adoption has also taken place, when the martial art of [[Taijiquan]], "great ultimate fist", become one of the practices of modern Taoist monks, while historically it was not among traditional techniques.

==Terminology==
The [[Chinese language]] has several keywords for Daoist meditation practices, some of which are difficult to translate accurately into English.

===Types of meditation===
Livia Kohn (2008a:118) distinguishes three basic types of Daoist meditation: "concentrative", "insight", and "visualization".

''Ding'' [[wikt:定|定]] literally means "decide; settle; stabilize; definite; firm; solid" and early scholars such as [[Xuanzang]] used it to translate [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Samadhi (Buddhism)|samadhi]]'' "deep meditative contemplation" in Chinese [[Buddhist texts]]. In this sense, Kohn (2008c:358) renders ''ding'' as "intent contemplation" or "perfect absorption." The ''[[Zuowanglun]]'' has a section called ''Taiding'' 泰定 "intense concentration"

''Guan'' [[wikt:觀|觀]] basically means "look at (carefully); watch; observe; view; scrutinize" (and names the ''[[Yijing]]'' [[I Ching hexagram 20#Hexagram 20|Hexagram 20]] ''Guan'' "Viewing"). ''Guan'' became the Daoist technical term for "monastery; abbey", exemplified by [[The Northern Celestial Masters#Louguan_.28450-688.29|Louguan]] 樓觀 "Tiered Abbey" temple, designating "Observation Tower", which was a major Daoist center from the 5th through 7th centuries (see [[Louguantai]]). Kohn (2008d:452) says the word ''guan'', "intimates the role of Taoist sacred sites as places of contact with celestial beings and observation of the stars." [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) Daoist masters developed ''guan'' "observation" meditation from Tiantai Buddhist ''zhiguan'' 止觀 "cessation and insight" meditation, corresponding to [[Buddhist_meditation#Tiantai_.C5.9Bamatha-vipa.C5.9Byan.C4.81|śamatha-vipaśyanā]] – the two basic types of Buddhist meditation are ''[[samatha]]'' "calm abiding; stabilizing meditation" and ''[[vipassanā]]'' "clear observation; analysis". Kohn (2008d:453) explains, "The two words indicate the two basic forms of Buddhist meditation: ''zhi'' is a concentrative exercise that achieves one-pointedness of mind or "cessation" of all thoughts and mental activities, while ''guan'' is a practice of open acceptance of sensory data, interpreted according to Buddhist doctrine as a form of "insight" or wisdom." ''Guan'' meditators would seek to merge individual consciousness into emptiness and attain unity with the Dao. 

''Cun'' [[wikt:存|存]] usually means "exist; be present; live; survive; remain", but has a sense of "to cause to exist; to make present" in the Daoist meditation technique, which both the [[Shangqing School]] and [[Lingbao School]]s popularized.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It thus means that the meditator, by an act of conscious concentration and focused intention, causes certain energies to be present in certain parts of the body or makes specific deities or scriptures appear before his or her mental eye. For this reason, the word is most commonly rendered "to visualize" or, as a noun, "visualization." Since, however, the basic meaning of ''cun'' is not just to see or be aware of but to be actually present, the translation "to actualize" or" actualization" may at times be correct if somewhat alien to the Western reader. (Kohn 2008b:287) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other key words===
Within the above three types of Daoist meditation, some important practices are:
*''[[Zuowang]]'' 坐忘 "sitting forgetting" was first recorded in the (c. 3rd century BCE) ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]''.
*''Shouyi'' 守一 "guarding the one; maintaining oneness" involves ''ding'' "concentrative meditation" on a single point or god within the body, and is associated with Daoist alchemical and longevity techniques (Kohn 1989b).The faith healer and author [[Zhi Gang Sha]] (2010: 135, 257) says ''shouyi'' means meditational focus on the ''jindan'' 金丹 "pill of immortality".
*''Neiguan'' 內觀 "inner observation; inner vision" is visualizing inside one's body and mind, including ''[[zangfu]]'' organs, inner deities, ''[[qi]]'' movements, and thought processes. 
*''Yuanyou'' 遠遊 "far-off journey; ecstatic excursion", best known as the ''[[Chuci]]'' poem title [[Yuan You]], was meditative travel to distant countries, sacred mountains, the sun and moon, and encounters with gods and ''[[Xian (Daoist)|xian]]'' transcendents.
*''Zuobo'' 坐缽 "sitting around the bowl ([[water clock]])" was a [[Quanzhen School]] communal meditation that was linked to Buddhist ''[[zuochan]]'' (Japanese ''[[zazen]]'') 坐禪 "sitting meditation"

==Warring States period==
The earliest Chinese references to meditation date from the [[Warring States period]] (475-221 BCE), when the philosophical [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] flourished.

===''Guanzi''===
Four chapters of the ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' have descriptions of meditation practices: ''Xinshu'' 心術 "Mind techniques" (chapters 36 and 37), ''Baixin'' 白心 "Purifying the mind" (38), and ''[[Neiye]]'' "Inward training" (49). Modern scholars (e.g., Harper 1999:880, Roth 1999:25) believe the ''Neiye'' text was written in the 4th century BCE and the others were derived from it. [[A. C. Graham]] (1989:100) regards the ''Neiye'' as "possibly the oldest 'mystical' text in China"; Harold Roth (1991:611-2) describes it as "a manual on the theory and practice of meditation that contains the earliest references to breath control and the earliest discussion of the physiological basis of self-cultivation in the Chinese tradition." Owing to the consensus that proto-Daoist [[Huang-Lao]] philosophers at the [[Jixia Academy]] in [[Qi (state)|Qi]] composed the core ''Guanzi'', ''Neiye'' meditation techniques  are technically "Daoistic" rather than "Daoist" (Roth 1991).

''Neiye'' Verse 8 associates ''dingxin'' 定心 "stabilizing the mind" with acute hearing and clear vision, and generating ''[[Jing (Chinese medicine)|jing]]'' 精 "vital essence". However, thought, says Roth (1999:114), is considered "an impediment to attaining the well-ordered mind, particularly when it becomes excessive." 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;If you can be aligned and be tranquil,
Only then can you be stable.
With a stable mind at your core,
With the eyes and ears acute and clear,
And with the four limbs firm and fixed,
You can thereby make a lodging place for the vital essence.
The vital essence: it is the essence of the vital energy.
When the vital energy is guided, it [the vital essence] is generated,
But when it is generated, there is thought,
When there is thought, there is knowledge,
But when there is knowledge, then you must stop.
Whenever the forms of the mind have excessive knowledge,
You lose your vitality. (tr. Roth 1999:60)&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Verse 18 contains the earliest Chinese reference to practicing breath-control meditation. Breathing is said to "coil and uncoil" or "contract and expand"', "with coiling/contracting referring to exhalation and uncoiling/expanding to inhalation" (Roth 1991:619). 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;For all [to practice] this Way:
You must coil, you must contract,
You must uncoil, you must expand,
You must be firm, you must be regular [in this practice].
Hold fast to this excellent [practice]; do not let go of it.
Chase away the excessive; abandon the trivial. 
And when you reach its ultimate limit
You will return to the Way and its inner power. (18, tr. Roth 1999:78)&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Neiye'' Verse 24 summarizes "inner cultivation" meditation in terms of ''shouyi'' 守一 "maintaining the one" and ''yunqi'' 運氣 "revolving the ''qi''". Roth (1999:116) says this earliest extant ''shouyi'' reference "appears to be a meditative technique in which the adept concentrates on nothing but the Way, or some representation of it. It is to be undertaken when you are sitting in a calm and unmoving position, and it enables you to set aside the disturbances of perceptions, thoughts, emotions, and desires that normally fill your conscious mind." 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;When you enlarge your mind and let go of it,
When you relax your vital breath and expand it,
When your body is calm and unmoving:
And you can maintain the One and discard the myriad disturbances.
You will see profit and not be enticed by it,
You will see harm and not be frightened by it.
Relaxed and unwound, yet acutely sensitive,
In solitude you delight in your own person.
This is called "revolving the vital breath":
Your thoughts and deeds seem heavenly. (24, tr. Roth 1999:92) &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Daodejing''===
Several passages in the classic ''[[Daodejing]]'' are interpreted as referring to meditation. For instance, "Attain utmost emptiness, Maintain utter stillness" (16, tr. Mair 1994:78) emphasizes ''xu'' 虛 "empty; void" and ''jing'' 靜 "still; quiet", both of which are central meditative concepts. Randal P. Peerenboom (1995:179) describes Laozi's contemplative process as "[[Apophatic theology|apophatic]] meditation", the "emptying of all images (thoughts, feelings, and so on) rather than concentration on or filling the mind with images", comparable with Buddhist ''[[Dhyāna_in_Buddhism#Nirodha-Samapatti|nirodha-samapatti]]'' "cessation of feelings and perceptions" meditation. 

Verse 10 gives what Roth (1999:150) calls "probably the most important evidence for breathing meditation" in the ''Daodejing''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;While you
Cultivate the soul and embrace unity,
can you keep them from separating?
Focus your vital breath until it is supremely soft,
can you be like a baby?
Cleanse the mirror of mysteries,
can you make it free of blemish?
Love the people and enliven the state,
can you do so without cunning?
Open and close the gate of heaven,
can you play the part of the female?
Reach out with clarity in all directions,
can you refrain from action?
It gives birth to them and nurtures them,
It gives birth to them but does not possess them,
It rears them but does not control them.
This is called “mysterious integrity.” (tr. Mair 1994:69)&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Three of these ''Daodejing'' phrases resonate with ''Neiye'' meditation vocabulary. ''Baoyi'' 抱一 "embrace unity" compares with ''shouyi'' 守一 "maintain the One" (24, Roth 1999:92 above). ''Zhuanqi'' 專氣 "focus your vital breath" is ''zhuanqi'' 摶氣 "concentrating your vital breath" (19, tr. Roth 1999:82). ''Dichu xuanjian'' 滌除玄覽 "cleanse the mirror of mysteries" and ''jingchu qi she'' 敬除其舍 "diligently clean out its lodging place" (13, Roth 1999:70) have the same verb ''chu'' "eliminate; remove".

The ''Daodejing'' exists in two received versions, named after the commentaries. The "Heshang Gong version" (see below) explains textual references to Daoist meditation, but the "Wang Bi version" explains them away. [[Wang Bi]] (226-249) was a scholar of ''[[Xuanxue]]'' "mysterious studies; neo-Daoism", which adapted Confucianism to explain Daoism, and his version eventually became the standard ''Daodejing''  interpretation. [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]] (tr. Erkes 1945:122) said Wang Bi's commentary changed the ''Daodejing'' "from a compendiary of magical meditation to a collection of free philosophical aperçus."

===''Zhuangzi''===
The (c. 4th-3rd centuries BCE) Daoist ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' refers to meditation in more specific terms than the ''Daodejing''. Two well-known examples of mental disciplines are [[Confucius]] and his favorite disciple [[Yan Hui (disciple of Confucius)|Yan Hui]] discussing ''xinzhai'' 心齋 "heart-mind fasting" and ''[[zuowang]]'' "sitting forgetting" (Roth 1991:602). In the first dialogue, Confucius explains ''xinzhai''.
&lt;blockquote&gt; "I venture to ask what 'fasting of the mind' is," said Hui.&lt;br&gt;
"Maintaining the unity of your will," said Confucius, "listen not with your ears but with your mind. Listen not with your mind but with your primal breath. The ears are limited to listening, the mind is limited to tallying. The primal breath, however, awaits things emptily. It is only through the Way that one can gather emptiness, and emptiness is the fasting of the mind." (4, tr. Mair 1994:32) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the second, Yan Hui explains ''zuowang'' meditation.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Yen Hui saw Confucius again on another day and said, "I'm making progress." 
"What do you mean?" 
"I sit and forget." 
"What do you mean, 'sit and forget'?" Confucius asked with surprise. 
"I slough off my limbs and trunk," said Yen Hui, "dim my intelligence, depart from my form, leave knowledge behind, and become identical with the Transformational Thoroughfare. This is what I mean by 'sit and forget'." 
"If you are identical," said Confucius, "then you have no preferences. If you are transformed, then you have no more constants. It's you who is really the worthy one! Please permit me to follow after you." (9, tr. Mair 1994:64) &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Roth (1999:154) interprets this "slough off my limbs and trunk" (墮肢體) phrase to mean, "lose visceral awareness of the emotions and desires, which for the early Taoists, have 'physiological' bases in the various organs." Peerenboom further describes ''zuowang'' as "aphophatic or cessation meditation."
&lt;blockquote&gt;One does away with sense perceptions, with all forms of cognition (thoughts, knowledge, conceptions, idea, images), with all valuations (preferences, norms, mores). Cognate to and a variant of ''wang'' (忘—to forget) is ''wang'' (亡—to destroy, perish, disappear, not exist). In the apophatic meditative process, all distinctions and ways of distinguishing are "forgotten" in the sense of eliminated: they cease to exist. (1995:198) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another ''Zhuangzi'' chapter describes breathing meditation that results in a body "like withered wood" and a mind "like dead ashes".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sir Motley of Southurb sat leaning against his low table. He looked up to heaven and exhaled slowly. Disembodied, he seemed bereft of soul. Sir Wanderer of Countenance Complete, who stood in attendance before him, asked, "How can we explain this? Can the body really be made to become like withered wood? Can the mind really be made to become like dead ashes? The one who is leaning against the table now is not the one who was formerly leaning against the table." "Indeed," said Sir Motley, "your question is a good one, Yen. Just now, I lost myself. Can you understand this? You may have heard the pipes of man, but not the pipes of earth. You may have heard the pipes of earth, but not the pipes of heaven." (2, tr. Mair 1994:10) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Victor Mair (1994:371) presents ''Zhuangzi'' evidence for "close affinities between the Taoist sages and the ancient Indian holy men. Yogic breath control and ''asanas'' (postures) were common to both traditions." First, this reference to "breathing from the heels", which is a modern explanation of the ''[[sirsasana]]'' "supported headstand".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The true man [i.e., ''[[zhenren]]''] of old did not dream when he slept and did not worry when he was awake. His food was not savory, his breathing was deep. The breathing of the true man is from his heels, the breathing of the common man is from his throat. The words of those who unwillingly yield catch in their throats as though they were retching. Those whose desires are deep-seated will have shallow natural reserves. (6, tr. Mair 1994:52) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Second, this "bear strides and bird stretches" reference to ''[[Xian (Daoism)|xian]]'' practices of yogic postures and breath exercises. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Retiring to bogs and marshes, dwelling in the vacant wilderness, fishing and living leisurely—all this is merely indicative of nonaction. But it is favored by the scholars of rivers and lakes, men who flee from the world and wish to be idle. Blowing and breathing, exhaling and inhaling, expelling the old and taking in the new, bear strides and bird stretches—all this is merely indicative of the desire for longevity. But it is favored by scholars who channel the vital breath and flex the muscles and joints, men who nourish the physical form so as to emulate the hoary age of Progenitor P'eng [i.e., [[Peng Zu]]]. (15, tr. Mair 1994:145) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Mair previously (1991:159) noted the (c. 168 BCE) [[Mawangdui Silk Texts]], famous for two ''Daodejing'' manuscripts, include a painted text that illustrates gymnastic exercises–including the "odd expression 'bear strides'."

===''Xingqi'' jade inscription===
Some writing on a Warring States era jade artifact could be an earlier record of breath meditation than the ''Neiye'', ''Daodejing'', or ''Zhuangzi'' (Harper 1999:881). This rhymed inscription entitled ''xingqi'' 行氣 "circulating ''qi''" was inscribed on a [[dodecagonal]] block of jade, tentatively identified as a pendant or a knob for a staff. While the dating is uncertain, estimates range from approximately 380 BCE ([[Guo Moruo]]) to earlier than 400 BCE ([[Joseph Needham]]). In any case, Roth (1997:298) says, "both agree that this is the earliest extant evidence for the practice of guided breathing in China."

The inscription says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;To circulate the Vital Breath:
Breathe deeply, then it will collect.
When it is collected, it will expand.
When it expands, it will descend.
When it descends, it will become stable.
When it is stable, it will be regular.
When it is regular, it will sprout.
When it sprouts, it will grow.
When it grows, it will recede.
When it recedes, it will become heavenly.
The dynamism of Heaven is revealed in the ascending;
The dynamism of Earth is revealed in the descending.
Follow this and you will live; oppose it and you will die. (tr. Roth 1997:298) &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Practicing this series of exhalation and inhalation patterns, one becomes directly aware of the "dynamisms of Heaven and Earth" through ascending and descending breath. ''Tianji'' 天機, translated "dynamism of Heaven", also occurs in the ''Zhuangzi'' (6, tr. Mair 1994:52), as "natural reserves" in "Those whose desires are deep-seated will have shallow natural reserves." Roth (1997:298-299) notes the final line's contrasting verbs, ''xun'' 訓 "follow; accord with" and ''ni'' 逆 "oppose; resist", were similarly used in the (168 BCE) ''[[Huangdi Sijing]]'' [[Hundred Schools of Thought#School of Yin-yang|Yin-yang]] silk manuscripts.

==Han Dynasty ==
As Daoism was flourishing during the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE), meditation practitioners continued early techniques and developed new ones. 

===''Huainanzi''===
The (139 BCE) ''[[Huainanzi]]'', which is an eclectic compilation attributed to [[Liu An]], frequently describes meditation, especially as a means for rulers to achieve effective government. 
 
Internal evidence reveals that the ''Huainanzi'' authors were familiar with the ''Guanzi'' methods of meditation (Roth 1991:630). The text uses ''xinshu'' 心術 "mind techniques" both as a general term for "inner cultivation" meditation practices and as a specific name for the ''Guanzi'' chapters (Major et al. 2010:44). 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The essentials of the world: do not lie in the Other but instead lie in the self; do not lie in other people but instead lie in your own person. When you fully realize it [the Way] in your own person, then all the myriad things will be arrayed before you. When you thoroughly penetrate the teachings of the Techniques of the Mind, then you will be able to put lusts and desires, likes and dislikes, outside yourself. (tr. Major et al. 2010:71). &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several ''Huainanzi'' passages associate breath control meditation with longevity and immortality (Roth 1991:648). For example, two famous ''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' "immortals":
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now Wang Qiao and Chi Songzi exhaled and inhaled, spitting out the old and internalizing the new. They cast off form and abandoned wisdom; they embraced simplicity and returned to genuineness; in roaming with the mysterious and subtle above, they penetrated to the clouds and Heaven. Now if one wants to study their Way and does not attain their nurturing of the ''qi'' and their lodging of the spirit but only imitates their every exhale and inhale, their contracting and expanding, it is clear that one will not be able to mount the clouds and ascend on the vapors. (tr. Major et al. 2010:414) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Heshang gong'' commentary===
The (c. 2nd century CE) ''Daodejing'' commentary attributed to [[Heshang Gong]] 河上公 (lit. "Riverbank Elder") provides what Kohn (2008:118) calls the "first evidence for Taoist meditation" and "proposes a concentrative focus on the breath for harmonization with the Dao."

Eduard Erkes says (1945:127-128) the purpose of the Heshang Gong commentary was not only to explicate the ''Daodejing'', but chiefly to enable "the reader to make practical use of the book and in teaching him to use it as a guide to meditation and to a life becoming a Taoist skilled in meditative training."

Two examples from ''Daodejing'' 10 (see above) are the Daoist meditation terms ''xuanlan'' 玄覽 (lit. "dark/mysterious display") "observe with a tranquil mind" and ''tianmen'' 天門 (lit. "gate of heaven") "middle of the forehead". ''Xuanlan'' occurs in the line 滌除玄覽 that Mair renders "Cleanse the mirror of mysteries". Erkes (1945:142) translates "By purifying and cleansing one gets the dark look", because the commentary says, "One must purify one's mind and let it become clear. If the mind stays in dark places, the look knows all its doings. Therefore it is called the dark look." Erkes explains ''xuanlan'' as "the Taoist term for the position of the eyes during meditation, when they are half-closed and fixed on the point of the nose." ''Tianmen'' occurs in the line 天門開闔 "Open and close the gate of heaven". The Heshang commentary (tr. Erkes 1945:143) says, "The gate of heaven is called the purple secret palace of the north-pole. To open and shut means to end and to begin with the five junctures. In the practice of asceticism, the gate of heaven means the nostrils. To open means to breathe hard; to shut means to inhale and exhale."

===''Taiping jing''===
The (c. 1st century BCE to 2nd century CE) ''[[Taiping Jing]]'' "Scripture of Great Peace" emphasized ''shouyi'' "guarding the One" meditation, in which one visualizes different cosmic colors corresponding with different parts of one's body.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In a state of complete concentration, when the light first arises, make sure to hold on to it and never let it go. First of all, it will be red, after a long time it will change to be white, later again it will be green, and then it will pervade all of you completely. When you further persist in guarding the One, there will be nothing within that would not be brilliantly illuminated, and the hundred diseases will be driven out. (tr. Kohn 1989b:140) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Besides "guarding the One" where a meditator is assisted by the god of Heaven, the ''Taiping jing'' also mentions "guarding the Two" with help from the god of Earth, "guarding the Three" with help from spirits of the dead, and "guarding the Four" or "Five" in which one is helped by the myriad beings (Kohn 1989b:139).

The ''Taiping jing shengjun bizhi'' 太平經聖君祕旨 "Secret Directions of the Holy Lord on the Scripture of Great Peace" is a Tang-period collection of ''Taiping jing'' fragments concerning meditation. It provides some detailed information, for instance, interpretations of the colors visualized. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;In guarding the light of the One, you may see a light as bright the rising sun. This is a brilliance as strong as that of the sun at noon. In guarding the light of the One, you may see a light entirely green. When this green is pure, it is the light of lesser yang. In guarding the light of the One, you may see a light entirely red, just like fire. This is a sign of transcendence. In guarding the light of the One, you may see a light entirely yellow. When this develops a greenish tinge, it is the light of central harmony. This is a potent remedy of the Tao. In guarding the light of the One, you may see a light entirely white. When this is as clear as flowing water, it is the light of lesser yin. In guarding the light of the One, you may see a light entirely black. When this shimmers like deep water, it is the light of greater yin. (tr. Kohn 1993:195-6) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the year 142, [[Zhang Daoling]] founded the [[Tianshi Dao|Tianshi]] "Celestial Masters" movement, which was the first organized form of Daoist religion. Zhang and his followers practiced ''Taiping jing'' meditation and visualization techniques. After the [[Way of the Five Pecks of Rice]] rebellion against the Han Dynasty, Zhang established a theocratic state in 215, which led to the downfall of the Han.

==Six Dynasties==
The historical term "[[Six Dynasties]]" collectively refers to the [[Three Kingdoms]] (220–280 AD), [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265–420), and [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] (420–589). During this period of disunity after the fall of the Han, Chinese Buddhism became popular and new schools of religious Daoism emerged.

===Early visualization meditation===
Daoism's "first formal visualization texts appear" in the 3rd century (Kohn 2008a:118). 

The ''Huangting jing'' 黃庭經 "Scripture of the Yellow Court" is probably the earliest text describing inner gods and spirits located in the human body. Meditative practices described in the ''Huangting jing'' include visualization of bodily organs and their gods, visualization of the sun and moon, and absorption of ''neijing'' 內景"inner light". 

The ''Laozi zhongjing'' 老子中經 "Central Scripture of Laozi" similarly describes visualizing and activating gods within the body, along with breathing exercises for meditation and longevity techniques. The adept envisions the yellow and red essences of the sun and moon, which activates [[Laozi]] and ''Yunü'' 玉女 "Jade Woman" within the abdomen, producing the ''shengtai'' 聖胎  "sacred embryo".

The ''[[Cantong qi]]'' "Kinship of the Three", attributed to [[Wei Boyang]] (fl. 2nd century), criticizes Daoist methods of meditation on inner deities.

===''Baopuzi''===
The Jin Dynasty scholar [[Ge Hong]]'s (c. 320) ''Baopuzi'' "Master who Embraces Simplicity", which is an invaluable source for early Daoism, describes ''shouyi'' "guarding the One" meditation as a source for magical powers from the ''zhenyi'' 真一 "True One".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Realizing the True One, the original unity and primordial oneness of all, meant placing oneself at the center of the universe, identifying one's physical organs with constellations in the stars. The practice led to control over all the forces of nature and beyond, especially over demons and evil forces. (Kohn 1993:197) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ge Hong says his teacher Zheng Yin 鄭隱 taught that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If a man can preserve Unity, Unity will also preserve him. In this way the bare blade finds no place in his body to inserts its edge; harmful things find no place in him that will admit entrance to their evil. Therefore, in defeat it is possible to be victorious; in positions of peril, to feel only security. Whether in the shrine of a ghost, in the mountains or forests, in a place suffering the plague, within a tomb, in bush inhabited by tigers and wolves, or in the habitation of snakes, all evils will go far away as long as one remains diligent in the preservation of Unity. (18, tr. Ware 1966:304-5) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Baopuzi'' also compares ''shouyi'' meditation with a complex ''mingjing'' 明鏡 "bright mirror" [[multilocation]] visualization process through which an individual can mystically appear in several places at once. 
&lt;blockquote&gt; My teacher used to say that to preserve Unity was to practice jointly Bright Mirror, and that on becoming successful in the mirror procedure a man would be able to multiply his body to several dozen all with the same dress and facial expression. (18, tr. Ware 1966:306) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Shangqing meditation===
The Daoist school of [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] "Highest Clarity" traces its origins to [[Wei Huacun]] (252-334), who was a Tianshi adept proficient in meditation techniques. Shangqing adopted the ''Huangting jing'' as scripture, and the [[hagiography]] of Wei Huacun claims a ''xian'' "immortal" transmitted it (and thirty other texts) to her in 288. Additional divine texts were supposedly transmitted to [[Yang Xi]] from 364 to 370, constituting the Shangqing scriptures.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The practices they describe include not only concentration on the ''bajing'' 八景 (Eight Effulgences) and visualization of gods in the body, but also active interaction with the gods, ecstatic excursions to the stars and the heavens of the immortals (''yuanyou'' 遠遊), and the activation of inner energies in a protoform of inner alchemy (''neidan''). The world of meditation in this tradition is incomparably rich and colorful, with gods, immortals, body energies, and cosmic sprouts vying for the adept's attention. (Kohn 2008a:119)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Lingbao meditation===
Beginning around 400 CE, the [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] "[[Numinous]] Treasure" School eclectically adopted concepts and practices from Daoism and Buddhism, which had recently been introduced to China. [[Ge Chaofu]], Ge Hong's grandnephew, "released to the world" the ''Wufu jing'' 五符經 "Talismans of the Numinous Treasure" and other Lingbao scriptures, and claimed family transmission down from [[Ge Xuan]] (164-244), Ge Hong's great uncle (Bokenkamp 2008:664).

The Lingbao School added the Buddhist concept of [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|reincarnation]] to the Daoist tradition of ''xian'' "immortality; longevity", and viewed meditation as a means to unify body and spirit (Robinet 1997:157).

Many Lingbao meditation methods came from native Chinese traditions, such as visualizing inner gods (''Taiping jing''), and circulating the solar and lunar essences (''Huangting jing'' and ''Laozi zhongjing''). Meditation rituals changed from individuals practicing privately to Lingbao clergy worshipping communally; frequently with the "multidimensional quality" of a priest performing interior visualizations while leading congregants in communal visualization rites (Robinet 1997:167).

===Buddhist influences===
During the Southern and Northern Dynasties period, the introduction of traditional [[Buddhist meditation]] methods richly influenced Daoist meditation.

The (c. late 5th-century) [[The Northern Celestial Masters]] text ''[[Xishengjing]]'' "Scripture of Western Ascension" recommends cultivating an empty state of consciousness called ''[[Mushin (mental state)|wuxin]]'' [[wikt:無心|無心]] (lit. "no mind") "cease all mental activity" (translating [[Sanskrit]] ''acitta'' from ''[[citta]]'' [[wikt:चित्त|चित्त]] "mind"), and advocates a simple form of ''guan'' 觀 "observation" insight meditation (translating ''[[vipassanā]]'' from ''vidyā'' [[wikt:विद्या|विद्या]] "knowledge") (Kohn 2008a:119).

Two early [[Chinese encyclopedias]], the (c. 570) Daoist encyclopedia ''Wushang biyao'' 無上秘要 "Supreme Secret Essentials" and the (7th century) Buddhistic ''Daojiao yishu'' 道教義樞 "Pivotal Meaning of Daoist Teachings" distinguish various levels of ''guan'' 觀 "observation" insight meditation, under the influence of the Buddhist [[Madhyamaka]] school's [[Two truths doctrine]]. The ''Daojiao yishu'', for instance, says. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Realize also that in concentration and insight, one does not reach enlightenment and perfection of body and mind through the two major kinds of observation [of energy and spirit] alone. Rather, there are five different sets of three levels of observation. One such set of three is: 1. Observation of apparent existence. 2. Observation of real existence. 3. Observation of partial emptiness. (tr. Kohn 1993:225) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Tang Dynasty==
Daoism was in competition with Confucianism and Buddhism during the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907), and Daoists integrated new meditation theories and techniques from Buddhists.

The 8th century was a "heyday" of Daoist meditation (Kohn 2008a:119); recorded in works such as [[Sun Simiao]]'s ''Cunshen lianqi ming'' 存神煉氣銘 "Inscription on Visualization of Spirit and Refinement of Energy", Sima Chengzhen 司馬承禎's ''[[Zuowanglun]]'' "Essay on Sitting in Forgetfulness", and Wu Yun 吳筠's ''Shenxian kexue lun'' 神仙可學論 "Essay on How One May Become a Divine Immortal through Training". These Daoist classics reflect a variety of meditation practices, including concentration exercises, visualizations of body energies and celestial deities to a state of total absorption in the Dao, and contemplations of the world. 

The (9th century) ''[[Qingjing Jing]]'' "Scripture of Clarity and Quiescence" associates the Tianshi tradition of a divinized Laozi with Daoist ''guan'' and Buddhist ''vipaśyanā'' methods of insight meditation. 

==Song Dynasty==
Under the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279), the Daoist schools of [[Quanzhen School|Quanzhen]] "Complete Authenticity" and [[Zhengyi Dao| Zhengyi]] "Orthodox Unity" emerged, and [[Neo-Confucianism]] became prominent.

Along with the continued integration of meditation methods, two new visualization and concentration practices became popular (Kohn 2008a:119). ''[[Neidan]]'' "inner alchemy" involved the circulation and refinement of inner energies in a rhythm based on the ''[[Yijing]]''. Meditation focused upon starry deities (e.g., the ''[[Ursa Major (Chinese astronomy)#Stars|Santai]]'' 三台 "Three Steps" stars in [[Ursa Major]]) and warrior protectors (e.g., the '' Xuanwu'' 玄武 "Dark Warrior; [[Black Tortoise]]" Northern Sky spirit).

==Later dynasties==
[[File:Yin and Yang.svg|thumb|The ''[[Taijitu]]'' diagram.]]
During the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1279–1367), Daoists continued to develop the Song period practices of ''neidan'' alchemy and deity visualizations.

Under the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644), ''neidan'' methods were interchanged between Daoism and [[Chan Buddhism]]. Many literati in the [[scholar-official]] class practiced Daoist and Buddhist meditations, which exerted a stronger influence on Confucianism (Kohn 2008a:120). 

In the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644–1912), Daoists wrote the first specialized texts on ''nüdan'' 女丹 "inner alchemy for women", and developed new forms of physical meditation, notably ''[[Taijiquan]]''—sometimes described as meditation in motion or moving meditation. This ''[[Neijia]]'' internal martial art is named after the [[Taijitu]] symbol, which was a traditional focus in both Daoist and [[Neo-Confucian]] meditation.

==Modern period==
[[Image:Stage1.gif|thumb|"Gathering the Light" from the Daoist ''neidan'' text ''[[The Secret of the Golden Flower]]'']]
Daoism and other Chinese religions were suppressed under the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (1912–1949) and in the [[People's Republic of China]] from 1949 to 1979. Many Daoist temples and monasteries have been reopened in recent years. 

Western knowledge of Daoist meditation was stimulated by [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]]'s (German 1929, English 1962) ''[[The Secret of the Golden Flower]]'' translation of the (17th century) ''neidan'' text ''Taiyi jinhua zongzhi'' 太乙金華宗旨.

In the 20th century, the ''[[Qigong]]'' movement has incorporated and popularized Daoist meditation, and "mainly employs concentrative exercises but also favors the circulation of energy in an inner-alchemical mode" (Kohn 2008a:120). Teachers have created new methods of meditation, such as [[Wang Xiangzhai]]'s ''[[zhan zhuang]]'' "standing like a post" in the ''[[Yiquan]]'' school.

'''David Malet Armstrong''' (8 July 1926&amp;nbsp;– 13 May 2014), often '''D. M. Armstrong''', was an [[Australia]]n [[philosopher]]. He is well known for his work on [[metaphysics]] and the [[philosophy of mind]], and for his defence of a [[State of affairs (philosophy)|factualist]] [[ontology]], a [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalist]] theory of the [[mind]], an [[Internalism and externalism|externalist]] [[epistemology]], and a [[modal logic|necessitarian]] conception of the [[Physical law|laws of nature]].&lt;ref name="BioDict20CPhil"&gt;

[[Keith Campbell (philosopher)|Keith Campbell]] said that Armstrong's contributions to metaphysics and epistemology "helped to shape philosophy's agenda and terms of debate", and that Armstrong's work "always concerned to elaborate and defend a philosophy which is ontically economical, synoptic, and compatibly continuous with established results in the natural sciences".&lt;ref name="BlackwellCompanion"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Metaphysics|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|pages=126–127|editors=Jaegwon Kim, Ernest Sosa and Gary S.

== Life and career ==
After studying at the [[University of Sydney]], Armstrong did a B.Phil at the [[University of Oxford]] and a Ph.D at the [[University of Melbourne]]. He taught at [[Birkbeck College]] in 1954–55, then at the University of Melbourne from 1956–63. In 1964, he became Challis Professor of Philosophy at the University of Sydney, where he stayed until his retirement in 1991. During his career, he was a visiting lecturer at a number of institutions including [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], the [[University of Notre Dame]], the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and [[Franklin and Marshall College]].&lt;ref name="Vita"&gt;

In 1974, when the University of Sydney's Philosophy department split into two departments—the Department for General Philosophy and the Department for Traditional and Modern Philosophy—Armstrong joined the latter along with [[David Stove]] and [[Keith Campbell (philosopher)|Keith Campbell]], while the former department pursued more radical politics and taught courses on [[Marxism]] and [[feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Armstrong's philosophy is broadly naturalistic. In ''Sketch for a Systematic Metaphysics'', Armstrong states that his philosophical system rests upon "the assumption that all that exists is the space time world, the physical world as we say". He justifies this by saying that the physical world "seems obviously to exist" while other things "seem much more hypothetical". From this fundamental assumption flows a rejection of [[abstract objects]] including [[Platonic forms]].&lt;ref&gt;

Armstrong's philosophy, while systematic, does not spend any time on social or ethical matters, and also does not attempt to build a [[philosophy of language]]. He once described his slogan as 'Put semantics last'&lt;ref name="ditext" /&gt; and, in ''Universals &amp; Scientific Realism'', he rebuts an arguments in favour of Plato's theory of forms that rely on semantics by describing "a long but, I think, on the whole discreditable tradition which tries to settle ontological questions on the basis of semantic considerations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Metaphysics ===

==== Universals ====
In metaphysics, Armstrong defends the view that universals exist (although Platonic uninstantiated universals do not exist). Those universals match up with the fundamental particles that science tells us about.&lt;ref name="Universals"&gt;
{{cite book
 |last1=Armstrong |first1=D. M.

 |title=Universals
 |publisher=[[Westview Press]]
 |isbn=978-0-8133-0763-3
 |ol=2211958M
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong describes his philosophy as a form of [[scientific realism]].&lt;ref&gt;

 |ol=7735301M
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong's universals are "sparse": not every predicate will have an accompanying property, but only those which are deemed basic by scientific investigation. The ultimate ontology of universals would only be realised with the completion of physical science. [[Mass]] would thus be a universal (subject to mass not being discarded by future physicists). Armstrong realises that we will need to refer to and use properties that are not considered universals in his sparse ontology—for instance, being able to refer to something ''being a game'' (to use the example from [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein's]] ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]''). Armstrong then suggests that a [[supervenience]] relation exists between these second order properties and the ontologically authentic universals given to us by physics.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong's theory of universals treats relations as having no particular ontological difficulty, they can be treated in the same way non-relational properties are. How Armstrong's theory of universals deals with relations with varying adicities has been raised as an issue by Fraser MacBride.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal

 |doi=10.1093/mind/fzi565
}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacBride argues that there can be relations where the number of terms in the relation varies across instances. Armstrong's response is to affirm a theory he describes as the Principle of Instantial Invariance, wherein the adicity of properties are essential and invariant. According to Armstrong, complex relations which seem to challenge the principle are not ontologically real but are second-order properties that can be reduced to more basic properties that subscribe to the Principle of Instantial Invariance.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong rejects [[nominalism|nominalist]] accounts of properties that attempt to align properties simply with classes. Coextension is a problem they face: if properties are simply classes, in a world where all blue things are also wet, class nominalists are unable to draw a distinction between the property of being blue and being wet. He provides an analogy to the argument in ''[[Euthyphro]]'': to say that electrons are electrons because they are part of the class of electrons puts the cart before the horse. They are part of the class of electrons ''because'' they ''are'' electrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mumford|2007|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Armstrong's view, nominalisms can also be criticised for producing a blob theory of reality. Objects have structure: they have parts, those parts are made of molecules, which are in turn made up of atoms standing in relation to one another, which are in turn made up of subatomic particles and so on. Blobbiness also threatens Platonic universals: a particular instantiating a universal in a world of Platonic universals becomes a matter of the blob-particular having a relation to a universal ''elsewhere'' (in the Platonic heaven, say), rather than having an internal relation in the way that a chemical element does to a constituent atom.&lt;ref name="Universals" /&gt;

Armstrong further rejects nominalisms that deny that properties and relations exist in reality because he suggests that these sorts of nominalisms, specifically referring to what he calls class nominalism, and resemblance nominalism, postulate primitives of either class membership or resemblance. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In terms of the origin of Armstrong's view of universals, Armstrong says his view of universals is "relatively unexplored territory" but points to [[Hilary Putnam]]'s 1970 paper 'On Properties'&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a possible forerunner. He also says that "Plato in his later works, Aristotle and the Scholastic Realists were ahead of contemporary philosophy in this matter, although handicapped by the relative backwardness of the science and the scientific methodology of their day".&lt;ref&gt;

==== States of affairs ====
Central to Armstrong's philosophy is the idea of [[states of affairs]] ("facts" in Russell's terminology): in ''Sketch for a Systematic Metaphysics'', Armstrong claims that states of affairs are "''the'' fundamental structures in reality".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 |last=Armstrong |first=D. M.
 |year=2010
 |title=Sketch for a Systematic Metaphysics
 |pages=36
 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]
 |isbn=978-0-19-965591-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A state of affairs roughly put is an instantiation of a particular and a universal: a state of affairs might be that a particular atom exists, instantiating a universal (say, that it is of a particular element, if chemical elements are ultimately accepted as part of Armstrong's universals). The particulars in Armstrong's ontology must have at least one universal—just as he rejects uninstantiated universals, he also rejects "unpropertied particulars".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mumford|2007|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong argues that states of affairs are distinct things in ontology because they are more than the sum of their parts. If some particular ''a'' has a non-symmetric relation ''R'' to another particular ''b'', then ''R (a, b)'' differs from ''R (b, a)''. It may be the case that ''R (a, b)'' obtains in the world but ''R (b, a)'' does not. Without states of affairs instantiating the particulars and universals (including relations), we cannot account for the truth of the one case and the falsity of the other.&lt;ref name="Universals"/&gt;

==== Laws of nature ====
Armstrong's theory of universals gives him the basis for an understanding of laws of nature as being relations between universals, a non-[[David Hume|Humean]] account of laws of nature proposed independently by Armstrong,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This account posits that the relations between universals are truthmakers for the statements about physical laws, and it is realist as it accepts that laws of nature are a feature of the world rather than just a way we talk about the world. Armstrong identifies the laws as holding between universals rather than particulars as an account of laws involving just particulars rather than universals would not adequately explain how laws of nature operate in the case of [[counterfactuals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mumford|2007|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To illustrate the theory, [[Stephen Mumford]] gives the example of ''all ravens are black''. Under the theory of Armstrong, Tooley and Dretske, there is a relation of necessity between the universals ravenhood and blackness, rather than there being a relationship with every single raven. This allows the explanation of laws of nature that have not been instantiated. Mumford cites the frequently-used example of the [[moa]] bird: "It is supposed that every bird of this now-extinct species died at a young age, though not because of anything in its genetic makeup. Rather, it died mainly because of some virus that just happened to sweep through the population. One bird could have escaped the virus only to be eaten by a predator on the day before its fiftieth birthday."&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the theory of Armstrong, Tooley and Dretske, such a coincidence would not be a law of nature.

==== Dispositions ====
Armstrong rejects [[Disposition#In analytic philosophy|dispositionalism]], the idea that dispositional properties (or powers as they are sometimes referred to) are ontologically significant and have an important role in explaining [[Physical law|laws of nature]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

 |title=Dispositions
 |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=E. N.
 |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]
 |publisher=[[Stanford University]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong believes that the challenge that dispositionalism presents for his account of laws of nature is not in the case of ''manifested'' dispositions (say, a glass dropping on the ground and breaking) but ''unmanifested'' dispositions (the fact that counter factually if one were to drop the glass on the ground, it ''would'' break). Armstrong simply states that the disposition is simply in the nature of the instantiated properties of the thing which is supposed to have the disposition.&lt;ref&gt;

 |pages=48–53
 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]
 |isbn=978-0-19-965591-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Truth and truthmakers ====
Regarding truth, Armstrong holds to what he describes as a "maximalist version" of [[truthmaker theory]]: he believes that every truth has a truthmaker, although there doesn't necessarily exist a one-to-one mapping between truth and truthmaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mumford|2007|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of one to many relations between truths and truthmakers is a feature that Armstrong believes allows truthmaker theory to answer some of the criticisms levelled at older correspondence theories of truth (of which he believes truthmaker theory to be an improved version).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 |last=Armstrong |first=D. M.
 |year=2010
 |title=Sketch for a Systematic Metaphysics
 |pages=61–66
 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]
 |isbn=978-0-19-965591-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative truths have truthmakers in Armstrong's account: he gives the example of a wall that is painted green. The wall being painted green is a truth for the proposition that it is ''not'' painted white ''and'' the proposition that it is ''not'' painted red and so on.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

 |title=Truths and Truthmakers
 |page=24
 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]
 |isbn=978-0-521-54723-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty in providing an adequate account of truthmakers for events in the past is one reason Armstrong gives for rejecting [[presentism (philosophy of time)|presentism]]—the view that only the present exists (another reason being the incompatibility of such a view with [[special relativity]]). Presentists, Armstrong argues, must either deny that truthmakers are needed for statements about the past, or account for them "by postulating rather strange truthmakers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |title=Sketch for a Systematic Metaphysics
 |pages=105
 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]
 |isbn=978-0-19-965591-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mind ====
Armstrong holds to a physicalist, functionalist theory of the mind. He initially was attracted to [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' and the rejection of Cartesian dualism. Armstrong did not accept behaviourism and instead defended a theory he referred to as the "central-state theory" which identifies mental states with the state of the central nervous system. In ''A Materialist Theory of Mind'', he accepted that mental states such as consciousness exist, but stated that they can be explained as physical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mumford|2007|pp=133–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong attributes his adoption of the central-state theory to the work of [[J. J. C. Smart]]—specifically the paper 'Sensations and Brain Processes'—and traces the lineage from there to [[Ullin Place]]'s 1956 paper 'Is Consciousness a Brain Process?'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Armstrong |first=D. M.
 |year=2010
 |title=Sketch for a Systematic Metaphysics
 |pages=101
 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]
 |isbn=978-0-19-965591-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Mumford said that Armstrong's ''A Materialist Theory of Mind'' "represents an authoritative statement of Australian materialism and was, and still is, a seminal piece of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mumford|2007|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epistemology ===
Armstrong's view of knowledge is that the conditions of knowledge are satisfied when you have a [[justified true belief]] that you arrived at through a reliable process: that is, the belief was caused by some factor in the external world (hence the label of externalism). Armstrong uses the analogy of a [[thermometer]]: as a thermometer changes to reflect the temperature of the environment it is in, so must one's beliefs if they are reliably formed. The connection between knowledge and the external world, for Armstrong, is a nomological relationship (that is, a law of nature relationship).&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intuitions that lead to this kind of externalism led [[Alvin Plantinga]] towards an account of knowledge that added the requirement for 'properly-functioning' cognitive systems operating according to a design plan.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Belief ====
On the question of the relationship between [[belief]]s and [[knowledge]], Armstrong defends a "weak acceptance" of the belief condition, namely that if a person can be said to know some thing ''p'', he or she believes ''p''. In a paper for the [[Aristotelian Society]], Armstrong rejects a series of linguistic arguments for a rejection of the belief condition which argue that one can have knowledge without having belief because a common usage of the word 'belief' is to imply lack of knowledge—Armstrong gives the example of if you asked a man on a railway station whether the train has just left and he said "I believe it has", you would take from this that he does not ''know'' that it has.&lt;ref name="PAS"&gt;
{{Cite journal
 |last=Armstrong |first=D. M.
 |year=1969
 |title=Does Knowledge Entail Belief?
 |journal=[[Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society]]
 |volume=70 |issue= |pages=21–36
 |jstor=4544782
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong also argues that contradictory beliefs show that there ''is'' a connection between beliefs and knowledge. He gives the example of a woman who has learned her husband is dead but cannot bring herself to ''believe'' her husband is dead. She both believes and disbelieves her husband is dead: it just happens that one of her two beliefs is justified, true and satisfies some knowledge conditions.&lt;ref name="PAS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mumford 2007 155"&gt;{{harvnb|Mumford|2007|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong presents a response to [[Colin Radford]]'s modified version of the "unconfident examinee" example. A student is asked when Queen Elizabeth I died, and he hesitatingly answers "1603" and exhibits no confidence in his answer. He has forgotten that at some point previously, he studied English history. Radford presents this as an example of knowledge without belief. But Armstrong differs on this: the unconfident examinee has a belief that Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603, he knows that she died in 1603, but he does not ''know that he knows''. Armstrong rejects the [[KK Principle]]—that to know some thing ''p'', one must know that one knows ''p''.&lt;ref name="PAS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mumford 2007 155"/&gt; Armstrong's rejection of the KK Principle is consistent with his wider externalist project.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Naive realism.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Direct realism argues we perceive the world directly]]

The question of '''direct''' or '''naïve realism''', as opposed to '''indirect''' or '''representational realism''', arises in the [[philosophy of perception]] and [[philosophy of mind|of mind]] out of the debate over the nature of [[Consciousness|conscious]] [[Qualia|experience]];&lt;ref name=lehar&gt;Lehar, Steve. (2000). [http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/consc1/consc1.html The Function of Conscious Experience: An Analogical Paradigm of Perception and Behavior], ''Consciousness and Cognition''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ce&gt;Lehar, Steve. (2000). [http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/epist/naive-philos.html Naïve Realism in Contemporary Philosophy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811172229/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/epist/naive-philos.html |date=2012-08-11 }}, ''The Function of Conscious Experience''.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] question of whether the world we see around us is the real world itself or merely an internal perceptual copy of that world generated by [[neural]] processes in our [[Human brain|brain]]. [[Naïve realism]] is known as ''direct'' realism when developed to counter ''indirect'' or representative realism, also known as epistemological dualism,&lt;ref&gt;Lehar, Steve. [http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/Representationalism.html Representationalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905185905/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/Representationalism.html |date=2012-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] position that our conscious experience is not of the real world itself but of an [[Mental representation|internal representation]], a miniature [[Virtual reality|virtual-reality]] replica of the world.

Indirect realism is broadly equivalent to the accepted view of [[perception]] in natural science that states that we do not and cannot perceive the external world as it really is but know only our ideas and interpretations of the way the world is.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]] (or audition) is the ability to perceive (create ideas of)sound by detecting vibrations. The sound waves of language cannot perceive directly. They are only heard, interpreted and understood because the physical waves were transformed into ideas (Mental representation of sound wages) by our brains.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Representationalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is one of the key assumptions of [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] in [[psychology]]. The representational realist would deny that "first-hand knowledge" is a coherent concept, since knowledge is always via some means. Our ideas of the world are interpretations of sensory input derived from an external world that is real (unlike the standpoint of [[idealism]], which holds that only ideas are real, but mind-independent things are not).

The main alternative to representationalism is '''anti-representationalism''',&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; the view according to which perception is not a process of constructing internal representations.

==History==
[[Aristotle]] was the first to provide a description of direct realism. In ''[[On the Soul]]'' he describes how a see-er is informed of the [[substance theory|object itself]] by way of the [[hylomorphism|hylomorphic form]] carried over the intervening material continuum with which the eye is impressed.&lt;ref name="Bernecker2008"&gt;{{cite book |first=S. |last=Bernecker |year=2008 |title=The Metaphysics of Memory |series=Philosophical Studies Series |publisher=Springer |isbn=9781402082191 |lccn=2008921236 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNk4jvxjVhUC&amp;pg=PA62 |page=62 |quote=The distinction between direct and indirect realism about perception has an interesting history. There was a time when perception was understood to be of things themselves, not of our ideas of things. This is what we find in Aristotle and Aquinas, who maintain that the mind or understanding grasps the form of the material object without the matter. What we perceive directly, on this view, are material objects. This changed in the seventeenth century with Descartes and Locke. who can be read as saying that the primary objects of perception are not things external to the mind but sense-data. Sense-data are the messengers that stand between us and physical objects such as tables and chairs. While indirect realism was the standard view of early modern philosophers, nowadays direct realism is, once again, in fashion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medieval philosophy]], [[direct realism]] was defended by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref name="Bernecker2008"/&gt;

Indirect realism was popular with several [[early modern philosophy|early modern philosophers]], including [[René Descartes]],&lt;ref name=Yolton&gt;John W. Yolton, ''Realism and Appearances: An Essay in Ontology'', Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]],&lt;ref name=Yolton/&gt; [[G. W. Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Dickerson, ''Kant on Representation and Objectivity'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Berkeley]],&lt;ref name=SEP-PP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-episprob/ The Problem of Perception (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]: "Paraphrasing David Hume (1739...; see also Locke 1690, Berkeley 1710, Russell 1912): nothing is ever directly present to the mind in perception except perceptual appearances."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Hume]].&lt;ref name=SEP-PP/&gt;

Locke categorized qualities as follows:&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Smith, "On Primary and Secondary Qualities", ''Philosophical Review'' (1990), 221–54.&lt;/ref&gt; 

* Primary qualities are qualities which are "explanatorily basic" – which is to say, they can be referred to as the explanation for other qualities or phenomena without requiring explanation themselves – and they are distinct in that our sensory experience of them resembles them in reality.  (For example, one perceives an object as spherical precisely because of the way the atoms of the sphere are arranged.)  Primary qualities cannot be removed by either thought or physical action, and include mass, movement, and, controversially, solidity (although later proponents of the distinction between primary and secondary qualities usually discount solidity).
* Secondary qualities are qualities which one's experience does not directly resemble; for example, when one sees an object as red, the sensation of seeing redness is not produced by some quality of redness in the object, but by the arrangement of atoms on the surface of the object which reflects and absorbs light in a particular way.  Secondary qualities include colour, smell, and taste.

[[Thomas Reid]], a notable member of the [[Scottish common sense realism]] was proponent of direct realism.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Rysiew, ''New Essays on Thomas Reid'', Routledge, 2017, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Direct realist views have been attributed to [[Baruch Spinoza]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Della Rocca (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Spinoza'', Oxford University Press, 2017, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[empirical realism]] has also been interpreted as a form of direct realism.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Schulting, Jacco Verburgt (eds.), ''Kant's Idealism: New Interpretations of a Controversial Doctrine'', Springer 2010, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Late modern philosophy|Late modern philosophers]], [[J. G. Fichte]] and [[G. W. F. Hegel]] followed Kant in adopting empirical realism.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Breazeale and [[Tom Rockmore]] (eds.), ''Fichte, German Idealism, and Early Romanticism'', Rodopi, 2010, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Rockmore]], ''Before and After Hegel: A Historical Introduction to Hegel's Thought'', Hackett Publishing, 2003, p. xviii: "Hegel follows Kant ... in limiting claims to know to the empirically real. In short, he adopts a view very similar to Kant's empirical realism."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gottlob Frege]] (in his paper "[[On Sense and Reference|Über Sinn und Bedeutung]]") also subscribed to indirect realism.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Lebens, ''Bertrand Russell and the Nature of Propositions: A History and Defence of the Multiple Relation Theory of Judgement'', Routledge, 2017, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contemporary philosophy]], indirect realism has been defended by [[Edmund Husserl]]&lt;ref&gt;Robin D. Rollinger, ''Husserl's Position in the School of Brentano'', ''Phaenomenologica'' 150, Dordrecht: Kluwer, 1999, p. 224 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bertrand Russell]]&lt;ref name=SEP-PP/&gt; Direct realism has been defended by [[Hilary Putnam]],&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Hilary. Sep. 1994. "The Dewey Lectures 1994: Sense, Nonsense, and the Senses: An Inquiry into the Powers of the Human Mind." ''The Journal of Philosophy'' '''91'''(9):445–518.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John McDowell]],&lt;ref&gt;John McDowell, ''Mind and World''. Harvard University Press, &lt;!--November--&gt;1994, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger F. Gibson, "McDowell's Direct Realism and Platonic Naturalism", ''Philosophical Issues'' Vol. 7, ''Perception'' (1996), pp. 275–281.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galen Strawson]],&lt;ref&gt;Galen Strawson, [https://vimeo.com/91346935 "Real Direct Realism"], a lecture recorded 2014 at Marc Sanders Foundation, Vimeo.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John R. Searle]].&lt;ref&gt;John R. Searle, ''Seeing Things as They Are: A Theory of Perception'', Oxford University Press, 2015, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, epistemological dualism has come under sustained attack by other contemporary philosophers, such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] (the [[private language argument]]) and [[Wilfrid Sellars]] in his seminal essay "Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind". Indirect realism is argued to be problematical because of [[Ryle's regress]] and the [[homunculus argument]]. However, recently reliance on the private language argument and the Homunculus Objection has itself come under attack. It can be argued that those who argue for "inner presence", to use Antti Revonsuo's term,&lt;ref&gt;Revonsuo, Antti (2006) ''Inner Presence:  Consciousness as a Biological Phenomenon,'' Cambridge MA:  MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; are not proposing  a private "referent", with the application of language to it being "private" and thus unshareable, but a ''private'' use of ''public'' language.  There is no doubt that each of us has a private understanding of public language, a notion that has been experimentally supported;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ragnar Rommetveit|Rommetveit, Ragnar]] (1974) ''On Message Structure:  A Framework for the Study of Language and Communication,'' London:  John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; George Steiner refers to our personal use of language as an "idiolect", one particular to ourselves in its detail.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, George (1998), ''After Babel:  Aspects of Language and Translation,'' London &amp; New York:  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The question has to be put how a collective use of language can go on when, not only do we have differing understandings of the words we use, but our sensory registrations differ.&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, C. L. (1988) ''Color for Philosophers,'' Indianapolis IN:  Hackett Pub. Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments against direct realism==

===The argument from illusion===
[[Image:Café wall.svg|250px|thumb|right|Illusion creates a problem for naïve realists as it suggests our senses are fallible, perceiving things that aren't there. In this illusion, the lines are horizontal, despite how they appear.]]
This argument was "first offered in a more or less fully explicit form in [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] ([[Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous|1713]])."&lt;ref name=sep&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-episprob/ Epistemological Problems of Perception], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to as the problem of conflicting appearances (e.g. [[Myles Burnyeat]]'s article ''Conflicting Appearances''). It has been argued that "informed commonsense" indicates that perceptions often depend on organs of perception.&lt;ref name="uor" /&gt; For example, humans would receive visual information very differently if they, like flies, had compound eyes, and may not even be able to imagine how things would appear with entirely different sense organs such as [[infra-red]] detectors or [[acoustic location|echo-location]] devices. Furthermore, perception systems can misrepresent objects even when in full working order, as shown, for example, by [[optical illusion]]s like the [[Müller-Lyer illusion]]. More dramatically, sometimes people perceive things which are not there at all, which can be termed instances of "hallucination" or "perceptual delusion".&lt;ref name=uor&gt;[http://www.rdg.ac.uk/AcaDepts/ld/Philos/jmp/Theory%20of%20Knowledge/NaiveRealism.htm Naïve Realism], [[University of Reading]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Double-alaskan-rainbow.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Illusions are present in nature. [[Rainbows]] are an example of a perceptual delusion. "For, unlike an architectural arch, a rainbow recedes as we approach it, never to be reached."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Gregory|Gregory, Richard.]] (2003). [http://www.perceptionweb.com/perception/perc0303/editorial.pdf Delusions.] ''Perception.'' '''32''', pp. 257-261.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[argument from illusion]] allegedly shows the need to posit sense-data as the immediate objects of perception. In cases of illusion or [[hallucination]], the object has qualities that no public physical object in that situation has and so must be distinct from any such object.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Naïve realism may accommodate these facts as they stand by virtue of its very vagueness (or "open-texture"): it is not specific or detailed enough to be refuted by such cases.&lt;ref name=uor/&gt; A more developed direct realist might respond by showing that various cases of misperception, failed perception, and perceptual relativity do not make it necessary to suppose that sense-data exist. When a stick submerged in water looks bent a direct realist is not compelled to say the stick actually is bent but can say that the stick can have more than one appearance: a straight stick can look bent when light reflected from the stick arrives at one's eye in a crooked pattern, but this appearance is not necessarily a sense-datum in the mind. Similar things can be said about the coin which appears circular from one vantage point and oval-shaped from another. Pressing on your eyeball with a finger creates double vision but assuming the existence of two sense-data is unnecessary: the direct realist can say that they have two eyes, each giving them a different view of the world. Usually the eyes are focused in the same direction; but sometimes they are not.

However, this response is presumably based on previously observed data. If one were to be able to observe nothing other than the stick in the water, with no previous information, it would appear that the stick was bent. Visual depth in particular is a set of inferences, not an actual experience of the space between things in a radial direction outward from the observation point.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Alex. (2003). [http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~lka/conr.htm The Empirical Description of Conscious Experience], ''The Science and Philosophy of Consciousness.''&lt;/ref&gt; If all [[empirical evidence]] is based upon observation then the entire developed memory and knowledge of every perception and of each sense may be as skewed as the bent stick. Since objects with different qualities are experienced from each of the different perspectives there is no apparent experiential basis for regarding one out of any such set of related perceptual experiences as the one in which the relevant physical object is itself immediately experienced. The most reasonable conclusion is that the experienced object is always distinct from the physical object or at least that there is no way to identify which, if any, of the immediately experienced objects is the physical object itself. Epistemologically it is as though physical objects were never given, whether or not that is in fact the case.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

Another potential counter-example involves vivid hallucinations: phantom elephants, for instance, might be interpreted as sense-data. A direct realist response would differentiate hallucination from genuine perception: no perception of elephants is going on, only the different and related mental process of hallucination. However, if there are visual images when we hallucinate it seems reasonable that there are visual images when we see. Similarly if dreaming involves visual and auditory images in our minds it seems reasonable to think there are visual and auditory images, or sense-data, when we are awake and perceiving things. This argument has been challenged in a number of different ways. First it has been questioned whether there must be some object present that actually has the experienced qualities, which would then seemingly have to be something like a sense-datum. Why couldn't it be that the perceiver is simply in a state of seeming to experience such an object without any object actually being present? Second, in cases of illusion and perceptual relativity there is an object present which is simply misperceived, usually in readily explainable ways, and no need to suppose that an additional object is also involved. Third, the last part of the perceptual relativity version of the argument has been challenged by questioning whether there is really no experiential difference between veridical and non-veridical perception; and by arguing that even if sense-data are experienced in non-veridical cases and even if the difference between veridical and non-veridical cases is, as claimed, experientially indiscernible, there is still no reason to think that sense-data are the immediate objects of experience in veridical cases. Fourth, do sense-data exist through time or are they momentary? Can they exist when not being perceived? Are they public or private? Can they be themselves misperceived? Do they exist in minds or are they extra-mental, even if not physical? On the basis of the intractability of these questions, it has been argued that the conclusion of the argument from illusion is unacceptable or even unintelligible, even in the absence of a clear diagnosis of exactly where and how it goes wrong.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

Direct realists can potentially deny the existence of any such thing as a mental image but this is difficult to maintain, since we seem able to visually imagine all sorts of things with ease. Even if perception does not involve images other mental processes like imagination certainly seem to. One view, similar to Reid's, is that we do have images of various sorts in our minds when we perceive, dream, hallucinate and imagine but when we actually perceive things, our sensations cannot be considered objects of perception or attention. The only objects of perception are external objects. Even if perception is accompanied by images, or sensations, it is wrong to say we perceive sensations. Direct realism defines perception as perception of external objects where an "external object" is allowed to be a photon in the eye but not an impulse in a nerve leading from the eye. Recent work in neuroscience suggests a shared ontology for perception, imagination and dreaming, with similar areas of brain being used for all of these.

==Problems with the indirect theory&lt;!--Linked from 'Social constructionism'--&gt;==

A problem with representationalism is that if simple data flow and [[information processing]] is assumed then something in the brain must be interpreting incoming data as a "percept". This something is often described as a [[homunculus]], although the term homunculus is also used to imply an entity that creates a continual [[Regress argument|regress]], and this need not be implied. This suggests that some phenomenon other than simple data flow and [[information processing]] is involved in perception. This is more of an issue now than it was for [[rationalism|rationalist]] philosophers prior to Newton, such as Descartes, for whom physical processes were poorly defined. Descartes held that there is a "homunculus" in the form of the soul, belonging to a form of natural substance known as ''[[Mental substance|res cogitans]]'' that obeyed different laws from those obeyed by solid matter (''[[res extensa]]''). Although Descartes' duality of natural substances may have echoes in modern physics (Bose and Fermi statistics) no agreed account of 'interpretation' has been formulated. Thus representationalism remains an incomplete description of perception. Aristotle realized this and simply proposed that ideas themselves (representations) must be aware—in other words that there is no further transfer of sense impressions beyond ideas.
[[Image:Rep-perception.jpg|right|thumb|400px|The representational theory of perception]]

A potential difficulty with representational realism is that, if we only have knowledge of representations of the world, how can we know that they resemble in any significant way the objects to which they are supposed to correspond? Any creature with a representation in its brain would need to interact with the objects that are represented to identify them with the representation. This difficulty would seem reasonably to be covered by the learning by exploration of the world that goes on throughout life. However, there may still be a concern that if the external world is only to be [[inference|inferred]], its 'true likeness' might be quite different from our idea of it. The representational realist would answer to this that "true likeness" is an intuitive concept that falls in the face of logic, since a likeness must always depend on the way in which something is considered.

A semantic difficulty may arise when considering [[reference]] in representationalism. If a person says "I see the Eiffel Tower" at a time when they are indeed looking at the Eiffel Tower, to what does the term "Eiffel Tower" refer? The direct realist might say that in the representational account people do not really see the tower but rather 'see' the representation. However, this is a distortion of the meaning of the word see which the representationalist does not imply. For the representationalist the statement refers to the Eiffel Tower, which implicitly is experienced in the form of a representation. The representationalist does not imply that when a person refers to the Eiffel Tower, they are referring to their [[Empirical evidence|sense experience]], and when another person refers to the Tower, they are referring to their sense experience.

Furthermore, representative realism claims that we perceive our perceptual intermediaries-we can attend to them-just as we observe our image in a mirror. However, as we can scientifically verify, this is clearly not true of the physiological components of the perceptual process. This also brings up the problem of [[mind-body dualism|dualism]] and its relation to representative realism, concerning the incongruous marriage of the metaphysical and the physical.

The new objection to the Homunculus Argument claims that it relies on a naive view of sensation.  Because the eyes respond to light rays is no reason for supposing that the visual field requires eyes to see it.  Visual sensation (the argument can be extrapolated to the other senses) bears no direct resemblance to the light rays at the retina, nor to the character of what they are reflected from or pass through or what was glowing at the origin of them.  The reason given is that they only bear the similarities of ''co-variation'' with what arrives at the retinas.&lt;ref&gt;Sellars, Roy Wood (1919), "The epistemology of evolutionary naturalism", Mind, 28:112, 407-26;  se p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt;  Just as the currents in a wire going to a loudspeaker vary proportionately with the sounds that emanate from it but have no other likeness, so too does sensation vary proportionately (and not necessarily directly) with what causes it but bears no other resemblance to the input.  This implies that the colour we experience is actually a cortical occurrence, and that light rays and external surfaces are not themselves coloured.  The proportional variations with which cortical colour changes are there in the external world, but not colour as we experience it.  Contrary to what Gilbert Ryle believed, those who argue for sensations being brain processes do not have to hold that there is a "picture" in the brain since this is impossible according to this theory since actual pictures in the external world are not coloured.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Edmond (2005), ''Narrative, Perception, Language, and Faith,'' Basingstoke:  Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 96-102.&lt;/ref&gt; It is plain that Ryle unthinkingly carried over what the eyes do to the nature of sensation; A. J. Ayer at the time described Ryle's position as "very weak".&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, A. J. (1957) ''The Problem of Knowledge,'' Harmondsworth:  Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; So there is no "screen" in front of cortical "eyes", no mental objects before one. As Thomas Hobbes put it: "How do we take notice of sense?—by sense itself". Moreland Perkins has characterized it thus: that sensing is not like kicking a ball, but rather "kicking a kick".&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, Thomas (1839 [1655]), ''Elements of Philosophy, The First Section: Concerning Body,'' London: John Bohn, p. 389;  Perkins, Moreland (1983), ''Sensing the World,'' Indianapolis IN: Hackett Pub. Co., pp. 286-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Today there are still philosophers arguing for colour being a property of external surfaces, light sources, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tye (2006), 'The puzzle of true blue', ''Analysis,'' 66: 173-78;  Matthen, Mohan (2009), 'Truly blue:  an adverbial aspect of perceptual representation', ''Analysis,'' 69:1, 48-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more fundamental criticism is implied in theories of this type. The differences at the sensory and perceptual levels between agents require that some means of ensuring at least a partial correlation can be achieved that allows the updatings involved in communication to take place.  The process in an informative statement begins with the parties hypothetically assuming that they are referring to the "same" entity or "property", even though their selections from their sensory fields cannot match; we can call this mutually imagined projection the "logical subject" of the statement.  The speaker then produces the logical predicate which effects the proposed updating of the "referent". If the statement goes through, the hearer will now have a different percept and concept of the "referent"—perhaps even seeing it now as two things and not one. The radical conclusion is that we are premature in conceiving of the external as already sorted into singular "objects" in the first place, since we only need to behave ''as if'' they are already logically singular.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Edmond (2005), ''Narrative, Perception, Language, and Faith,'' Basingstoke:  Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 103-120.&lt;/ref&gt; The diagram at the beginning of this entry would thus be thought of as a false picture of the actual case, since to draw "an" object as already selected from the real is only to treat the practically needful, but strictly false, hypothesis of objects-as-logically-singular as ontologically given. The proponents of this view thus argue that there is no need actually ''to believe'' in the singularity of an object since we can manage perfectly well by ''mutually imagining'' that 'it' is singular.  A proponent of this theory can thus ask the direct realist feels why he or she thinks it is necessary to move to taking the imagining of singularity for real when there is no practical difference in the outcome in action.  Therefore, although there are selections from our sensory fields which for the time being we treat as if they were objects, they are only provisional, open to corrections at any time, and, hence, far from being direct ''representations'' of pre-existing singularities, they retain an experimental character.  Virtual constructs or no, they remain, however, selections that are causally linked to the real and can surprise us at any time—which removes any danger of solipsism in this theory.  This approach dovetails with the philosophy known as [[social constructivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Glasersfeld, Ernst von (1995), ''Radical Constructivism:  A Way of Knowing and Learning,'' London:  RoutledgeFalmer.&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of experience of a physical object can be altered in major ways by changes in the conditions of perception or of the relevant sense-organs and the resulting [[Neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] processes, without change in the external physical object that initiates this process and that may seem to be depicted by the experience. Conversely any process that yields the same sensory/neural results will yield the same perceptual experience, no matter what the physical object that initiated the process may have been like. Furthermore, the causal process that intervenes between the external object and the perceptual experience takes time, so that the character of the experience reflects, at the most, an earlier stage of that object than the one existing at the moment of perception. As in observations of astronomical objects the external object may have ceased to exist long before the experience occurs. These facts are claimed to point to the conclusion that the direct object of experience is an entity produced at the end of this causal process, distinct from any physical object that initiates the process."&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

==The adverbial theory==
The above argument invites the conclusion of a perceptual dualism that raises the issue of how and whether the object can be known by experience. The adverbial theory proposes "that this dualism is a dualism of ''objects'', with perceptual experience being a more direct experience of objects of a different sort, [[sense-data]]."&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Perceptual dualism implies:&lt;blockquote&gt;both an ''act'' of awareness (or apprehension) and an ''object'' (the sense-datum) which that act apprehends or is an awareness of. The fundamental idea of the adverbial theory, in contrast, is that there is no need for such objects and the problems that they bring with them (such as whether they are physical or mental or somehow neither). Instead, it is suggested, merely the occurrence of a mental act or mental state with its own intrinsic character is enough to account for the character of immediate experience.&lt;ref name="sep" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to the adverbial theory, when, for example, I experience a silver elliptical shape (as when viewing a coin from an angle) I am in a certain specific state of sensing or sensory awareness or of being appeared to: I sense in a certain manner or am appeared to in a certain way, and that specific manner of sensing or of being appeared to accounts for the content of my experience: I am in a certain distinctive sort of experiential state. There need be no object or entity of any sort that is literally silver and elliptical in the material world or in the mind. I experience a silver and [[Ellipse|elliptical]] shape because an object or entity that literally has that color and shape is directly before my mind. But the nature of these entities and the way in which they are related to the mind are difficult to understand. The adverbial theory has the advantage of being metaphysically simpler, avoiding issues about the nature of sense-data, but we gain no real understanding of the nature of the states in question or of how exactly they account for the character of immediate experience."&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

'''Environmental theology''' pertains to "The study of God’s relationship to the environment" (Jacobus, 2004).

==Background==
{{Quote box|quote="The disclosure of God's relationship to the world is essential to an environmental theology" |source = {{mdash}} (Johnson, 1994; Rust, 1971).}}

[[Lynn Townsend White, Jr.|Lynn White, Jr.]] must be associated with any scholarly writings on environmental theology because his work in the 1960s precipitated a renewed interest in the field on a massive scale. “The Historical Roots of our Ecological Crisis” (White, 1967) is the most common citation in a literature review on the subject.

Writings in environmental theology normally cover two veins of thought. One sector being a belief system and the other sector being a behavior system. It is commonly found that documents closely associated with environmental theology do not directly define the term (Jacobus, 2001). A distinction should be made; theology is a belief system and ethics is a behavior system.

==Basic environmental theology==
Environmental theology generally must include an understanding of God's relationship to the cosmos or Creation, a cosmology. Robert J. Jacobus divides the possibilities into three basic views of [[God]]’s physical relationship with the [[Natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aged.wvu.edu/r/download/214927 Defining Environmental Theology: Content Analysis of Associated Literature], thesis, West Virginia University&lt;/ref&gt; One, the Creator-God exists externally to the physical world (Timm, 1994). The second is God exists internally in the environment (McFague, 1993, Tobias, 1994). The third basic view stipulates God as an entity does not exist (Berry, 1994; Callicott, 1994; Swimme, 1994; Wei-ming, 1994). Three variations of these basic types can be identified in literature. The first is the person of God can be distinctly separate from the environment and also exist internally in the environment (White, 1994). A second variation purports that God and nature exist as separate deities (Griffin, 1994). The third variation denies God as a cognitive entity and views the environment as Creator/deity. If God is external to the environment God then the Creator-God interfaces with the environment as a distinct entity, while if God is internal to the environment, one may make no distinction between the person of God and the environment and the notion of Creator itself may become problematic. A mystical viewpoint common to several religious traditions that unites these categories is that God is continuously creating the universe, and that the universe is a direct expression of God's being, rather than an object created by God as the subject.

From the environmental perspective the corresponding worldviews would be (1) nature is created, (2) nature is divine and (3) nature is emergent.  Three environmental theologies emerge, (1) God exists eternally and the environment is God’s creation, (2) the environment is God (Nelson, 1990) and (3) the environment emerged from physical conditions (Fraley, 2000). But Robert S. Corrington goes so far as to say that God is an emergent property of the cosmos itself.&lt;ref&gt;Nature and Spirit (New York: Fordham University Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is not a clear distinction between environmental theology and [[ecotheology]], though the term environmental theology might indicate a theology in which environmental ethics is established prior to one's understanding of the meaning of God.

{{Bible sidebar |expanded=interpretation}}

'''Ethics in the Bible''' refers to the system(s) or theory(ies) produced by the study, interpretation, and evaluation of biblical morals, (including the [[morality|moral code, standards, principles, behaviors, conscience, values, rules of conduct, or beliefs]] concerned with good and evil and right and wrong), that are found in the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew]] and [[Bible#Christian Bibles|Christian Bibles]]. It comprises a narrow part of the larger fields of [[Jewish ethics|Jewish]] and [[Christian ethics]], which are themselves parts of the larger field of philosophical [[ethics]]. Ethics in the Bible is unlike other western ethical theories in that it is seldom overtly philosophical. It presents neither a systematic nor a formal deductive ethical argument.  Instead, the Bible provides patterns of [[moral reasoning]] that focus on conduct and character in what is sometimes referred to as [[virtue ethics]]. This moral reasoning is part of a broad, normative covenantal tradition where duty and virtue are inextricably tied together in a mutually reinforcing manner.

The ethics of the Bible are religious ethics. 

There is extensive and wide—spread criticism of ethics in the Bible, and some have called it [[Immorality|immoral]] in some of its teachings. Slavery, genocide, 
supersessionism, the death penalty, violence, patriarchy, sexual intolerance, colonialism, and the problem of evil and a good God, are examples of criticisms of ethics in the Bible.

==Overview==
===The Bible===
According to traditional Jewish enumeration, the Hebrew canon is composed of 24 books which came into being over a span of almost a millennium.&lt;ref name= "Alan Mittleman"/&gt;{{rp|17}} The Bible's earliest texts reflect a Late Bronze Age Near Eastern civilization, while its last text, usually thought to be Daniel, comes from a second century BCE Hellenistic world. This historical development has to be taken into consideration in any account of ethics in the Bible.&lt;ref name= "Alan Mittleman"/&gt;{{rp|17}}  Ethicist Eryl W. Davies writes that many scholars question whether the biblical account can be regarded as an accurate account of "how it really happened." The Bible has an "air of appearing to know things we are actually very unsure about, and it has tended to state as fact what was merely speculation...  There is a growing recognition it reflects the ethical values and norms of the educated class in ancient Israel, and that very little can be known about the moral beliefs of the 'ordinary' Israelites."&lt;ref name="Eryl W. Davies"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davies |first1=Eryl W. |title=The Ethics of the Hebrew Bible |journal=Transformation |date=April 2007 |volume=24. |issue=No.2 |pages=110–114 |jstor=43052699 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111}}  As a result, many scholars believe the Bible is unsuitable for "doing philosophy."&lt;ref name="Jaco Gericke"/&gt;{{rp|148}} Philosopher Jaco Gericke quotes philosopher Robert P. Carroll saying the Bible is "too untidy, too sprawling, and too boisterous to be tamed by neat systems of thought."&lt;ref name="Jaco Gericke"/&gt;{{rp|148}} 

At the same time, ethicist John Barton says most scholars recognize the Bible is "more than just a jumble of isolated precepts with no underlying rationale."&lt;ref name="John Barton2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barton |first1=John |title=Understanding Old Testament Ethics: Approaches and Expectations |date=2003 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location=Louisville, Kentucky |isbn=978-0-66422-596-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}}  The biblical narratives, laws, wisdom sayings, parables, and unique genrés of the Bible are the sources of its ethical concepts.&lt;ref name="Alan Mittleman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mittleman |first1=Alan L. |title=A Short History of Jewish Ethics: Conduct and Character in the Context of Covenant |date=2012 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Chichester, West Suffix |isbn=978-1-4051-8942-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1,2}} However, Barton also says there are problematic texts and the author's intent is not always easy to decipher. Much of biblical narrative refrains from direct comment, and there are problems in turning to the narratives for ethical insight.&lt;ref name="John Barton"/&gt;{{rp|1-3}} "First... the narratives are often far from morally edifying... Second, though Old Testament stories are about what we might call 'moral issues', it is often not easy to decide what is being commended and what deplored.  Third there is a general problem about describing the moral world of biblical narrative... are we talking about the real world...or the imagined world?"&lt;ref name="John Barton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barton |first1=John |title=The Nature of Biblical Criticism |date=2007 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location=Louisville, Kentucky |isbn=978-0-664-22587-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vocz7rnZ0IwC }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref name="Alan Mittleman"/&gt;{{rp|1-17}} Barton concludes, the Bible's moral "philosophy is more complicated than it might appear."&lt;ref name="John Barton"/&gt;{{rp|9}}

Jewish philosophers Shalom Carmy and David Schatz explain one of many difficulties doing philosophy in the Bible is that philosophers dislike contradicting themselves whereas the Bible, by contrast, "often juxtaposes contradictory ideas, without explanation or apology..."&lt;ref name="Carmy and Schatz"/&gt;{{rp|13-14}} Gericke says using a descriptive, rather than an analytical philosophical approach, means the pluralism of the Bible need not be a problem. Descriptive philosophy is aimed purely at clarifying meaning and therefore, it has no difficulty "simply stating the nature of the [[Synchrony and diachrony|diachronic variation]] and [[Synchrony and diachrony|synchronic variability]] found in the biblical texts."&lt;ref name="Jaco Gericke"/&gt;{{rp|146}}  Carmy and Schatz say the Bible does philosophical activity when it "depicts the character of God, presents an account of creation, posits a metaphysics of divine providence and divine intervention, suggests a basis for morality, discusses many features of human nature, and frequently poses the notorious conundrum of how God can allow evil."&lt;ref name="Carmy and Schatz"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carmy |first1=Shalom |last2=Schatz |first2=David |editor1-last=Frank |editor1-first=Daniel H. |editor2-last=Learnman |editor2-first=Oliver |title=History of Jewish Philosophy |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=London, England |chapter=The Bible as a Source for Philosophical Reflection}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13,14}}

===Ethics===
Philosopher [[Alan Mittleman]] says ethics in the Bible is not like western ethical theories in that it is seldom overtly "philosophical." It presents neither a systematic nor a deductive formal ethical argument, nor does it address traditional Western philosophical questions and arguments .&lt;ref name="Alan Mittleman"/&gt;{{rp|1,2}}&lt;ref name="Harold M. Schulweis"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schulweis |first1=Harold M. |title=Evil and the Morality of God |date=2010 |publisher=KTAV Publishing House |location=Brooklyn, New York |isbn=978-1-60280-155-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of Western approaches is not evidence there is an absence of ethics in the Bible however. Textual scholar Jaco Gericke writes, "The tendency to deny the Hebrew Bible anything philosophical when its rhetoric does not conform to Western varieties of philosophical systems actually involves a colonialist ethnocentric hermeneutical fallacy."&lt;ref name="Jaco Gericke"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gericke |first1=Jaco |title=The Hebrew Bible and Philosophy of Religion |date=2012 |publisher=Society of Biblical Literature |location=Atlanta, Georgia |isbn=978-1-58983-707-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|156-157}} &lt;ref name="Jaco Gericke"/&gt;{{rp|156}} While there is no Western-style ethical system in the Bible, there are ''folk philosophical presuppositions'' in it; "in other words, the biblical texts contain metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical assumptions about the nature of reality, existence, life, knowledge, truth, belief, good and evil, value and so on" of the ancient folk who recorded it.&lt;ref name="Jaco Gericke"/&gt;{{rp|157}}  Considering ethics in the Bible, therefore, means not using philosophical terms such as "[[deontological]]," [[casuistic]]," "[[apodictic]]," and [[theodicy]]," while still recognizing that, if a piece of literature contains ethical assumptions, it contains metaphysical and epistemological assumptions as well.&lt;ref name="Jaco Gericke"/&gt;{{rp|211}}  It is "impossible to understand the Bible's fundamental structures of meaning without attending to the text's basic assumptions regarding reality, knowledge and value."&lt;ref name="Jaco Gericke"/&gt;{{rp|9,206}} These assumptions fall into the four basic philosophical categories.&lt;ref name="Jaco Gericke"/&gt;{{rp|157}}  

First, Gericke says, metaphysics is found anywhere the Bible has something to say about "the nature of existence, [[reality]], [[being]], substance, [[mereology]], [[Philosophy of space and time|time and space]], [[causality]], [[Metaphysics|identity and change]], objecthood and relations (e.g. subject and object), [[Accident (philosophy) |essence and accident]], properties and functions, [[modal logic|necessity and possibility (modality)]], [[order (virtue)|order]], [[Mind-body dichotomy|mind and matter]], [[Freewill|freewill and determinism]], and so on."&lt;ref name="Jaco Gericke"/&gt;{{rp|207}}  Rolf Knierim says the Bible's metaphysic is "dynamistic ontology" which says reality is a dynamic process.&lt;ref name="Jaco Gericke"/&gt;{{rp|208}} Ancient texts do not use ontological language of "being." Instead, philosopher Mark Smith explains that in the Bible, a fundamental ontology is embodied in language about power where the world and its beings derive their reality (their being, their power to exist, and to act), from the power of God (Being itself). The messenger divinities, the angels, derive their power from the One God, as do human kings.  In metaphysical language, the power of lesser beings participates in Power itself, identified as God.&lt;ref name="Mark S. Smith"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Mark S. |title=The Memoirs of God: History, Memory, and the Experience of the Divine in Ancient Israel |date=2004 |publisher=Fortress Press |location=Minneapolis, Minnesota |isbn=978-0-8006-3485-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|162}} 

Secondly, there is epistemology in the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref name="Jaco Gericke"/&gt;{{rp|209}} The Hebrew Bible contains assumptions about the nature of knowledge, belief, truth, interpretation, understanding and cognitive processes. Pluralism is the norm, so that no unified epistemology can be reconstructed, however, an ''[[ethnoepistemology]]'' can be found. Ethnoepistemology examines the "entire gamut of human epistemological practices from ordinary folk to diviners, shamans, priests," and the authors themselves.&lt;ref name="Jaco Gericke"/&gt;{{rp|209}}  Ethicist Michael V. Fox writes the primary axiom in Proverbs is that "the exercise of the human mind is the necessary and sufficient condition of right and successful behavior in all reaches of life: practical, ethical and religious" revealing a "folk presupposition" of epistemology: virtue is knowledge.&lt;ref name="Michael V. Fox"/&gt;{{rp|78}}

Third there is ethics, and the Bible's ''[[meta ethics|meta-ethical]]'' assumptions: "the meaning of good and evil, the nature of right and wrong, criteria for moral discernment, valid sources of morality, the origin and acquisition of moral beliefs, the ontological status of moral norms, moral authority, cultural pluralism, axiological and aesthetic assumptions about the nature of value and beauty. These are all implicit in the texts."&lt;ref name="Jaco Gericke"/&gt;{{rp|210}} Fox writes that ancient Hebrew wisdom literature dwells on wisdom in a manner that separates it from wisdom literature of other ancient Near Eastern cultures. "This focus is closely bound to its ethics."&lt;ref name="Michael V. Fox"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fox |first1=Michael V. |title=Ethics and Wisdom in the Book of Proverbs |journal=Hebrew Studies |date=2007 |volume=48 |pages=75–88 |jstor=27913833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|76}} Mittleman explains that ethics in the Bible are provided by patterns of moral reasoning that focus on conduct and character. This moral reasoning is part of a broad normative covenantal tradition where duty and virtue are inextricably tied together in a mutually reinforcing manner.&lt;ref name="John Barton"/&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref name="Alan Mittleman"/&gt;{{rp|17}}  Sociologist Stephen Mott says ethics in the Bible is a corporate, community based ethic. It is not simply individual.&lt;ref name="Steven Mott"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mott |first1=Steven |title=Biblical Ethics and Social Change |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-973937-0 |edition=  Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3–69}} 

Fourth there is logic. The Bible's discourse contains assumptions about what constitutes valid arguments, the nature of language and its relation to reality.&lt;ref name="Jaco Gericke"/&gt;{{rp|210}}  The philosophy of the Bible is a religious philosophy, and that is implicit in its texts on "the nature of reasoning in religious thought, the warranting of beliefs, the justification of religious experience, strategies in polemical arguments, the nature of rational thinking, and the logic of belief revision."&lt;ref name="Jaco Gericke"/&gt;{{rp|210}}

==Ethical paradigms==
Ethicist John Barton says there are three basic models, patterns or [[paradigm|paradigms]] that form the basis of all ethics in the Bible: (1) obedience to God's will; (2) natural law; and (3) the imitation of God.&lt;ref name="John Barton2"/&gt;{{rp|46-47}}  Barton goes on to say the first is probably the strongest model.&lt;ref name="John Barton2"/&gt;{{rp|51}} Obedience as a basis for ethics is found in Law and in the wisdom literature and in the Prophets. Eryl Davies says it is easy to overemphasize obedience as a paradigm since there is also a strong goal—oriented character to the moral teaching in the Bible.&lt;ref name="Eryl W. Davies"/&gt;{{rp|112}} Asking where a course of action would lead was normal for the culture portrayed in biblical texts, and even laws have "motive clauses" oriented toward the future prosperity of the person being asked to obey.&lt;ref name="John Barton2"/&gt;{{rp|46-48,52}}

"Natural law" as Barton uses it is "a vague phrase meant to be suggestive rather than defining."&lt;ref name="John Barton2"/&gt;{{rp|48}} Eryl Davies says it is a term that should be used with some reservation since this is not the highly developed "natural law" found in Western thought. Nevertheless, the loosely defined paradigm is suggested by the ordering of the book of Genesis, where the creation story and the natural order were made a focal point as the book was assembled and edited.  It is in the Wisdom literature, the Prophets, Romans 1, and Acts 17.&lt;ref name="John Barton2"/&gt;{{rp|49}}&lt;ref name="John Barton2"/&gt;{{rp|48}} It can be found in the book of Amos, where nations other than Israel are held accountable for their ethical decisions (Amos 1:3—2:5).&lt;ref name="John Barton2"/&gt;{{rp|50}}

Davies says the clearest expression of the imitation of God as a basis for ethics is in Leviticus 19:2 where Yahweh instructs Moses to tell the people to be holy because Yahweh is holy.&lt;ref name="Eryl W. Davies"/&gt;{{rp|112}} This idea is also in Leviticus 11:44; 20:7,26; 21:8. The prophets also asserted that God had moral qualities the Israelites should emulate.  The Psalmists also frequently reflect on God's character forming the basis of the ethical life of those who worship Yahweh. Psalm 111, and 112 set out the attributes of God that must be reflected in the life of a 'true follower.'&lt;ref name="Eryl W. Davies"/&gt;{{rp|112}} The ethic has limits; Barton points out that in 1 Samuel 26:19 David argues that if his own persecution is ordered by God that is one thing, but if it is the work of people, those people should be cursed.&lt;ref name="John Barton2"/&gt;{{rp|51}}

==Ethical topics and themes==

===Political ethics===
[[File:Das Lied der Debora.jpg|thumb|The Judge Debora]]
{{See also|Political ethics}}
The Bible mandates [[monarchy]], and also supports notions of [[theocracy]]; the speech of [[Abijah of Judah]] in [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 2 13:4-12 is taken as one of the purest expressions of this idea; Yahweh ordained only David and his progeny to rule in Jerusalem and only Aaron and his progeny to serve in the Temple, and any other claims to political or religious power or authority is against the will of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Knoppers |first1=Gary N. |title='Battling Against Yahweh' : Israel's War against Judah in 2 Chr 13:2-20 |journal=Revue Biblique (1946-) |date=1993 |volume=100 |issue=4 |pages=511–532 |jstor=44093419}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Deuteronomist]] redaction of the Hebrew Bible especially emphasizes these ideas about the unity of politics and religion in a political state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sweeney |first1=Marvin Alan |title=King Josiah of Judah: The Lost Messiah of Israel |date=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195133240 |page=9ff |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sXc8DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biblical descriptions of divinely ordained monarchy directly underlie the understanding of Jesus as the "son of David" and the [[messiah]] (the annointed king) who at some point will govern the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v26doW8jIyYC&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Christianity: An Introduction | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | last=McGrath | first=Alister E. | authorlink=Alister McGrath | year=2006 | pages=4–6 | isbn=978-1-4051-0899-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walzer finds political ethics expressed in the Hebrew Bible in covenant, law, and prophecy, and he says they constitute an early form of ''almost'' democratic political ethics.&lt;ref name="Michael Walzer"/&gt;{{rp|200}} First, God's covenant requires everyone adhere equally to the agreement they made, as in later [[General will|"general will" theories of democracy]]. "In the biblical texts, poor people, women, and even strangers, are recognized as [[Moral agency|moral agent]]s in their own right whatever the extent of that agency might be."&lt;ref name="Michael Walzer"/&gt;{{rp|200}} Second, Walker finds the idea that everyone was subject to God's law -- that kings were not involved in making or interpreting the law, but were as subject to it, in principle, as every other Israelite. Third, Walzer finds in the Bible, prophets speak as the interpreters of divine law in public places to ordinary people. They came from every social strata and denounced the most powerful men in society—and everyone else too. Walzer wrote: "Their public and uninhibited criticism is an important signifier of religious democracy."&lt;ref name="Michael Walzer"/&gt;{{rp|200–201}}

Warfare as a political act of nationhood, is a topic the Bible addresses ethically, both directly and indirectly, in four ways: there are verses that support [[pacifism]], and verses that support [[non-resistance]]; 4th century theologian [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] identified aspects of [[just war]] in the Bible, and [[preventive war]] which is sometimes called [[crusade]] has also been supported using Bible texts.&lt;ref name="Robert G.

Many of those refer to peace as a central part of God's purpose for mankind. Political activist [[David Cortright]] writes that ''shalom'' (peace in Hebrew) is a complex word with levels of meaning that embody the conditions and values necessary to prevent war: "social justice, self-determination, economic well-being, human rights, and the use of non-violent means to resolve conflict."&lt;ref name="David Cortright"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cortright |first1=David |title=Peace: A History of Movements and Ideas |date=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-521-85402-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|188}} Most texts used to support pacifism are in the New Testament, such as Matthew 5:38-48 and Luke 6:27-36, but not all.

The right to a fair trial, and fair punishment, are also required (Deuteronomy 19:15; Exodus 21:23-25).

The ''zonah'' of the Hebrew Bible is a woman who is not under the authority of a man; she may be a paid prostitute, but not necessarily. In the Bible, for a woman or girl who was under the protection of a man to be called a "''zonah''" was a grave insult to her and her family. The ''zonah'' is shown as lacking protection, making each ''zonah'' vulnerable and available to other men; the lack of a specific man governing her meant that she was free to act in ways that other women weren't. According to David Blumenthal, the Bible depicts the ''zonah'' as "dangerous, fearsome and threatening by her freedom, and yet appealing and attractive at the same time."&lt;ref name="Blumenthal"/&gt;{{rp|42}}  Her freedom is recognized by biblical law and her sexual activity is not punishable.&lt;ref name="Blumenthal"/&gt;{{rp|42}} She is the source of extra-institutional sex. Therefore she is seen as a threat to patriarchy and the family structure it supports.&lt;ref name="Blumenthal"/&gt;{{rp|43}} Over time, the term "''zonah''" came to applied to a married woman who committed adultery, and that sense of the term was used as a metaphor for people being unfaithful to Yahweh, especially in the [[Book of Hosea]] and the [[Book of Ezekiel]]; the descriptions of sexual acts and punishments of the metaphorical ''zonah'' in those books are brutal and pornographic.&lt;ref name="Blumenthal"/&gt;{{rp|43}}

The Hebrew Bible contains strict purity laws, both ritual and moral.&lt;ref name="Eve Levavi Feinstein"/&gt;{{rp|176}}  Near Eastern scholar Eve Levavi Feinstein writes "The concepts of pollution and sexuality seem inextricably linked," yet the views in the Bible vary more than is generally recognized.&lt;ref name="Eve Levavi Feinstein"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Feinstein |first1=Eve Levavi |title=Sexual Pollution in the Hebrew Bible |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-939554-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} Pollution terminology is used for illegal sexual contact such as rape and adultery, and it is also used for legal and licit sexual intercourse, menstruation, and for some perhaps unavoidable diseases.  This makes the Bible's view of the relationship between temporary ritual pollution and more serious moral pollution "murky."&lt;ref name="Eve Levavi Feinstein"/&gt;{{rp|2}} Pollution concepts in the Hebrew Bible are connected to certain areas of experience such as sex, death, and certain kinds of illnesses and food.&lt;ref name="Eve Levavi Feinstein"/&gt;{{rp|3}}  The Hebrew term for pollution appears 286 times and the term for purity appears 207 times.&lt;ref name="Eve Levavi Feinstein"/&gt;{{rp|3}} Feinstein says the Hebrew Bible never uses the term 'pure' (טָהֵר) to describe virginity, but does use it to describe a married woman who has not committed adultery (Numbers 5:28).&lt;ref name="Eve Levavi Feinstein"/&gt;{{rp|2}} Wanton, unrepentant sins are seen as having a contaminating effect on the sanctuary similar to environmental pollution.&lt;ref name="Eve Levavi Feinstein"/&gt;{{rp|8}}

[[File:St Photina.jpg|thumb|180px|Orthodox [[icon]] of [[Photina]], the [[Samaritan woman at the well|Samaritan woman]], meeting Jesus by the well.]]
Jesus often spoke directly to women in public. The disciples were astonished to see Jesus talking with the Samaritan woman at the well of Sychar (John 4:7-26). He spoke freely with the woman taken in adultery (John 8:10–11), with the widow of Nain (Luke 7:12–13), the woman with the bleeding disorder (Luke 8:48; cf. Matt. 9:22; Mark 5:34), and a woman who called to him from a crowd (Luke 11:27–28). Similarly, Jesus addressed a woman bent over for eighteen years (Luke 13:12) and a group of women on the route to the cross (Luke 23:27-31).  Jesus spoke in a thoughtful, caring manner. Each synoptic writer records Jesus addressing the woman with the bleeding disorder tenderly as “daughter” and he refers to the bent woman as a “daughter of Abraham” (Luke 13:16). Theologian Donald G. Bloesch infers that “Jesus called the Jewish women ‘daughters of Abraham’ (Luke 13:16), thereby according them a spiritual status equal to that of men.”&lt;ref name="Donald G. Bloesch"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bloesch |first1=Donald G. |title=Is the Bible Sexist?  Beyond Feminism and Patriarchalism |date=2001 |publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock |location=Eugene, Oregon |isbn=978-1-57910-691-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}} Jesus held women personally responsible for their own behavior: the woman at the well (John 4:16–18), the woman taken in adultery (John 8:10–11), and the sinful woman who anointed his feet (Luke 7:44–50). Jesus dealt with each as having the personal freedom and enough self-determination to deal with their own repentance and forgiveness.  There are several Gospel accounts of Jesus imparting important teachings to and about women: his public admiration for [[Lesson of the widow's mite|a poor widow who donated two copper coins]] to the Temple in Jerusalem, his friendship with Mary of Bethany and [[Martha]], the sisters of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], and the presence of [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Mary, mother of Jesus|his mother]], and the other women as he was crucified.  New Testament scholar [[Ben Witherington III]] says "Jesus broke with both biblical and rabbinic traditions that restricted women's roles in religious practices, and He rejected attempts to devalue the worth of a woman, or her word of witness."&lt;ref name="Ben Witherington III1984"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witherington III|first1=Ben|title=Women in the Ministry of Jesus: A Study of Jesus' attitudes to women and their roles as reflected in his earthly life|date=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0 521 34781 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127}}

The New Testament names many women among the followers of Jesus and in positions of leadership in the early church.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Sue Poorman|last2=Richards|first2=Lawrence O.|title=Women of the Bible: The Life and Times of Every woman in the Bible|date=2003|publisher=Thomas Nelson Publishers|location=Nashville, Tenn.|isbn=978-0-7852-5148-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mary Keng Mun Chung"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keng Mun Chung|first1=Mary|title=Chinese Women in Christian Ministry: An Intercultural Study|date=2005|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8204-5198-5|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New Testament scholar Linda Belleville says "virtually every leadership role that names a man also names a woman. In fact there are more women named as leaders in the New Testament than men.  [[Phoebe (biblical figure)|Phoebe]] is a 'deacon' and a 'benefactor' (Romans 16:11-2).  [[Mary, mother of John Mark|Mary]], [[Lydia of Thyatira|Lydia]] and Nympha are overseers of house churches (Acts 12:12; 16:15; Colossians 4:15). [[Euodia and Syntyche]] are among 'the overseers and deacons' at [[Philippi]] (Philippians 1:1; cf, 4:2-3).  The only role lacking specific female names is that of 'elder'--but there male names are lacking as well."&lt;ref name=Belleville&gt;{{cite book|author1=Linda Belleville|chapter=Chapter 1: Women in Ministry: an egalitaritan perspective|editor1-last=Beck|editor1-first=James R., et al|title=Two views on women in ministry|date=2009|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|isbn=9780310254379|oclc=779330381}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54,112}}
  
New Testament scholar [[Craig Blomberg]] asserts three primary texts critical to the traditional patriarchal view of women and women's roles as being supported in the New Testament:  "''1 Corinthians 14:34-35'', where women are commanded to be silent in the church; ''1 Timothy 2:11-15'' where women (according to the TNIV) are not permitted to teach or have authority over a man; and ''1 Corinthians 11:2-16'' where the male and female relationship is defined in terms of ''kephalē'' commonly translated ''head.''"&lt;ref name=Blomberg&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Blomberg|author1-first==Craig L.|chapter=Women in Ministry: a complementarian perspective|editor1-last=Beck|editor1-first=James R.|title=Two views on women in ministry|date=2009|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|isbn=9780310254379}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Belleville/&gt;{{rp|97}}

Classics scholar Kyle Harper references the historian Peter Brown as showing ethics concerning sexuality and accepted sexual practices was at the heart of the early clash over Christianity's place in the world. Views on sexuality in the early church were diverse and fiercely debated within its various communities; these doctrinal debates took place within the boundaries of the ideas in Paul's letters and in the context of an often persecuted minority seeking to define itself from the world around it.  In his letters, Paul often attempted to find a middle way among these disputes, which included people who saw the gospel as liberating them from all moral boundaries, and those who took very strict moral stances.&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"/&gt;{{rp|1-14,84-86,88}}  Conflicts between Christianity and the culture surrounding it over sexuality, as well as within Christianity itself, were fierce. For example, in Roman culture, widows were required to remarry within a few years of their husband's death, but Christian widows were not required to remarry and could freely choose to remain single, and celibate, with the church's support.&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"/&gt;{{rp|1-7}} As Harper says, "The church developed the radical notion of individual freedom centered around a libertarian paradigm of complete sexual agency."&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"/&gt;{{rp|4}} Many widows and single women were choosing not to marry, were staying celibate, and were encouraging other women to follow, but pagan response to this female activity was negative and sometimes violent toward Christianity as a whole.&lt;ref name="Margaret Y. MacDonald"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Margaret Y.|title=Early Christian Women and Pagan Opinion The power of the hysterical woman|date=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=NY|isbn=0 521 56174 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|164}} Margaret MacDonald demonstrates these dangerous circumstances were likely the catalysts for the "shift in perspective concerning unmarried women from Paul's [early] days to the time of the [[Pastoral epistles]]".&lt;ref name="Margaret Y. MacDonald"/&gt;{{rp|164}&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"/&gt;{{rp|1-11}}&lt;ref name="Margaret Y. MacDonald"/&gt;{{rp|164}} }

The sexual-ethical structures of Roman society were built on status, and sexual modesty and shame meant something different for men than it did for women, and for the well-born than it did for the poor, and for the free citizen than it did for the slave.&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"&gt;{{cite book| last=Harper| first=Kyle| title=From Shame to Sin: The Christian Transformation of Sexual Morality in Late Antiquity| year=2013| publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusettes| isbn=978-0-674-07277-0 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}}  In the Roman Empire, shame was a social concept that was always mediated by gender and status.&lt;ref name="John Younger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rebecca Langlands"&gt;{{cite book| last=Langlands| first=Rebecca| title=Sexual Morality in Ancient Rome|year=2006| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge, UK| isbn=978-0-521-85943-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|10,38}}&lt;ref name="John Younger"&gt;{{cite book| last=Younger| first=John| title=Sex in the Ancient World from A to Z|year=2005| publisher=Routledge| location= New York| isbn=978-0-415-24252-3| page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Harper says: "The model of normative sexual behavior that developed out of Paul's reactions to the erotic culture surrounding him...was a distinct alternative to the social order of the Roman empire."&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"/&gt;{{rp|85}} For Paul, according to Harper, "the body was a consecrated space, a point of mediation between the individual and the divine."&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"/&gt;{{rp|88–92}} The ethical obligation for sexual self-control was placed equally on all people in the Christian communities, men or women, slave or free. In Paul's letters, ''porneia,'' (a single name for an array of sexual behaviors outside marital intercourse), became a central defining concept of sexual morality, and shunning it, a key sign of choosing to follow Jesus. Sexual morality could be shown by forgoing sex altogether and practicing chastity, remaining virgin, or having sex only within a marriage.&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"/&gt;{{rp|88–92}} Harper indicates this was a transformation in the deep logic of sexual morality as personal rather than social, spiritual rather than merely physical, and for everyone rather than solely for those with status.&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"/&gt;{{rp|6,7}}

==Criticism==

[[Elizabeth S. Anderson|Elizabeth Anderson]], a Professor of Philosophy and Women's Studies at the [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]], states that "the Bible contains both good and evil teachings", and it is "morally inconsistent".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Anderson, "If God is Dead, Is Everything Permitted?" In {{cite book |title= The Portable Atheist: Essential Readings for the Nonbeliever|last= Hitchens|first= Christopher|year= 2007|publisher= Da Capo Press|location= Philadelphia|isbn= 978-0-306-81608-6|page= 336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson criticizes commands God gave to men in the Old Testament, such as: kill adulterers, homosexuals, and "people who work on the Sabbath" (Leviticus 20:10; Leviticus 20:13; Exodus 35:2, respectively); to commit [[ethnic cleansing]] (Exodus 34:11-14, Leviticus 26:7-9); commit [[genocide]] (Numbers 21: 2-3, Numbers 21:33–35, Deuteronomy 2:26–35, and Joshua 1–12); and other mass killings.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Elizabeth Anderson, "If God is Dead, Is Everything Permitted?"

Anderson criticizes what she terms morally repugnant lessons of the New Testament. She claims that "Jesus tells us his mission is to make family members hate one another, so that they shall love him more than their kin" (Matt 10:35-37), that "Disciples must hate their parents, siblings, wives, and children (Luke 14:26)", and that Peter and Paul elevate men over their wives "who must obey their husbands as gods" (1 Corinthians 11:3, 14:34-5, Eph. 5:22-24, Col. 3:18, 1 Tim. 2: 11-2, 1 Pet. 3:1).&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Anderson, "If God is Dead, Is Everything Permitted?" In {{cite book |title = The Portable Atheist: Essential Readings for the Nonbeliever|last = Hitchens|first = Christopher|year = 2007|publisher = Da Capo Press|location = Philadelphia|isbn = 978-0-306-81608-6|page = 338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson states that the [[Gospel of John]] implies that "infants and anyone who never had the opportunity to hear about Christ are damned [to hell], through no fault of their own".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Anderson, "If God is Dead, Is Everything Permitted?" In {{cite book |title = The Portable Atheist: Essential Readings for the Nonbeliever|last = Hitchens|first = Christopher|year = 2007|publisher = Da Capo Press|location = Philadelphia|isbn = 978-0-306-81608-6|page = 339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simon Blackburn]] states that the "Bible can be read as giving us a carte blanche for harsh attitudes to children, the mentally handicapped, animals, the environment, the divorced, unbelievers, people with various sexual habits, and elderly women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackburn criticizes what he terms morally suspect themes of the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last = Blackburn|first = Simon|authorlink =Simon Blackburn|year = 2001|publisher = Oxford University Press|location = Oxford|isbn = 978-0-19-280442-6|pages = 11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes some "moral quirks" of Jesus: that he could be "sectarian" (Matt 10:5–6),&lt;ref&gt;

Blackburn provides examples of Old Testament moral criticisms, such as the phrase in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:18, which he says has "helped to burn alive tens or hundreds of thousands of women in Europe and America": "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." He states that the Old Testament God apparently has "no problems with a slave-owning society", considers birth control a crime punishable by death, and "is keen on child abuse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|pages= 10, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional examples that are questioned today are: the prohibition on touching women during their "period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19–24)", the apparent approval of selling daughters into slavery (Exodus 21:7), and the obligation to put to death someone working on the Sabbath (Exodus 35:2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1011">'''Eusebius of Myndus''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Εὐσέβιος}}) was a 4th-century philosopher, a distinguished [[Neoplatonist]]. He is described by [[Eunapius]] as one of the links in the "Golden Chain" of [[Neoplatonism]]. 

He was a pupil of [[Aedesius]] of [[Pergamon|Pergamum]]. He devoted himself principally to [[logic]] and ventured to criticize the magical and [[theurgic]] side of the doctrine. By this he exasperated the later Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], who preferred the [[mysticism]] of [[Maximus of Ephesus|Maximus]] and [[Chrysanthius]]. 

[[Stobaeus]] collected a number of ethical dicta of one Eusebius, who may perhaps be identical with the Neoplatonist.

'''Everard Digby''' (born c. 1550) was an English academic theologian, expelled as a Fellow of [[St John's College, Cambridge]] for reasons that were largely religious. He is known as the author of a 1587 book, written in Latin, that was the first work published in England on [[human swimming|swimming]]; and also as a philosophical teacher, writer and controversialist. The swimming book, ''De Arte Natandi'', was a practical treatise following a trend begun by the [[archery]] book ''Toxophilus'' of [[Roger Ascham]], of Digby's own college.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence V. Ryan, ''Roger Ascham'' (1963), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Eugene D. Hill, in Digby's ''Theoria Analytica'' of 1579,

{{cquote|his intuition of many ‘mysteries’ in Aristotle's ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' leads him to develop a theory which conflates technical logic with a vast mass of [[Neoplatonic]] and [[Cabal]]istic lore taken (not always with acknowledgement) from [[Ficino]]'s translation of [[Plotinus]] and from the Cabalistic dialogues of [[Johannes Reuchlin]].&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Hamilton (editor), ''The Spenser Encyclopedia'' (1997), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Born about 1550, he matriculated as a [[sizar]] of St John's College, Cambridge, 25 October 1567; was admitted a scholar 9 November 1570; proceeded B. A. 1570-1, M.A. 1574, and B.D. 1581; and became a Lady Margaret fellow on 12 March 1572-3, and senior fellow 10 July 1585.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=DGBY567E|name=Digby, Everard}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was principal lecturer in 1584. Digby took part in the college performance of [[Thomas Legge]]'s ''[[Richardus Tertius]]'' in 1580.&lt;ref name = DNB&gt;{{Cite DNB|wstitle=Digby, Everard (fl.1590)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the end of 1587 he was deprived of his fellowship. In a letter to Chancellor of the University [[Lord Burghley]], [[William Whitaker (theologian)|William Whitaker]], master of St John's College (4 April 1588), explained that this step had been rendered necessary by Digby's arrears with the college steward. He added that Digby had preached voluntary poverty, a 'popish position,' at [[Church of St Mary the Great, Cambridge|St Mary's]]; had attacked [[Calvinists]] as schismatics; was in the habit of blowing a horn and hallooing in the college during the daytime, and repeatedly spoke of the master to the scholars with the greatest disrespect. Burghley and [[John Whitgift]] ordered Digby's restitution; but Whitaker stood firm, and with the support of the [[Earl of Leicester]] obtained confirmation of the expulsion.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

==Writings and controversy==
Digby's best known book is a treatise on swimming, the earliest published in England.&lt;ref&gt;The title runs: ''De Arte Natandi libri duo, quorum prior regulas ipsius artis, posterior vero praxin demonstrationemque continet,' Lond. 1587, dedicated to Richard Nourtley.&lt;/ref&gt; ''De Arte Natandi'' is illustrated with plates,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/library/special_collections/early_books/pix/natandi.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and was translated into English by [[Christopher Middleton (d. 1628)|Christopher Middleton]] in 1595&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt; as ''A Short Introduction for to Learne to Swimme''. This [[biomechanics]] of swimming is considered the best swimming book for over 300 years. It deals with the [[specific weight]] of objects and humans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]]: Swimming and the Emergence of Modern Spirit, in: John McClelland &amp; Brian Merrilees (eds.): Sport and Culture in Early Modern Europe. Toronto: Center of Reformation and Renaissance Studies 2007, pp. 407 - 430&lt;/ref&gt;

Digby also wrote a work against [[Ramism]]&lt;ref&gt;''De Duplici methodo libri duo, unicam P. Rami methodum refutantes: in quibus via plana, expedita &amp; exacta., secundum optimos autores, ad scientiarum cognitionem elucidatur'', London, Henry Bynneman, 1580.&lt;/ref&gt; and his own system, ''Theoria analytica'',&lt;ref&gt;'Theoria analytica viam ad monarchiam scientiarum demonstrans . . . totius Philosophiae &amp; reliquarum scientiarum''&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to [[Sir Christopher Hatton]], 1579. [[William Temple (logician)|William Temple]] of [[King's College, Cambridge]], wrote, under the pseudonym of Franciscus Mildapettus, an attack on Digby's criticism of [[Petrus Ramus]], to which Digby replied in 1580. Temple replied again in 1581.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

As the productions of a predecessor of [[Francis Bacon]], Digby's two philosophical books are notable, although clumsy in expression and overlaid with scholastic subtleties. Digby tried in his ''Theoria Analytica'' to classify the sciences, and elsewhere ventures on a theory of perception based on the notion of the active correspondence of mind and matter. Otherwise Digby is a disciple of Aristotle.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

Digby was also author of ''Everard Digbie, his Dissuasive from taking away the Lyvings and Goods of the Church'', with ''Celsus of Verona, his Dissuasive, translated into English'', London, 1589, dedicated to Sir Christopher Hatton.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:FarmBot Genesis Rick Carlino (left) and Rory Aronson (right).jpg|thumb|FarmBot creators Rick Carlino (left) and Rory Aronson (right) building a FarmBot in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]]]

The FarmBot project was started in 2011 by American Rory Aronson whilst studying mechanical engineering at [[California Polytechnic State University]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://agfundernews.com/farmbot-founder-aronson-on-open-source-tech-and-encouraging-consumers-to-farm5832.html|title=FarmBot Founder Aronson on Open Source Tech and Encouraging Consumers to Farm - AgFunderNews|date=2016-05-11|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aronson attended an elective course in [[Organic farming|organic agriculture]] where he learned about a [[tractor]] that used machine vision to detect and cover weeds which removed the need for herbicides or manual labour, the tractor cost over $1 million USD.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In September 2013 Aronson published a [[white paper]] outlining the goals of the project to "''Grow a community that produces free and open-source hardware plans, software, data, and documentation enabling everyone to build and operate a farming machine."''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The project is a response to the 60% increase food production needed due to the growth in world population to between 7 - 9 billion by 2050 and the potential of precision agriculture to reduce the environmental impacts of farming by reducing water use, energy, transportation, petrochemicals and time required to grow crops.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In March 2014 Aronson began working on the project full-time funded by a grant from the [[Shuttleworth Foundation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Firmware developer Tim Evers and software developer Rick Carlino later joined the project as core developers and the open source community Farmbot.cc was created to support the development of the project.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In March 2014 Rory Aronson created the company Farmbot.io to provide hardware kits and software services and to serve as a funding source to maintain the open source community.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In 2014 and 2015 FarmBot was entered into the [[Hackaday]] Prize where it became a finalist in 2015.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.atmel.com/2016/06/02/farmbot-is-the-worlds-first-open-source-cnc-farming-machine/|title=FarmBot is the world’s first open source CNC farming machine|last=says|first=Brian Despain|date=2016-06-02|website=Atmel Bits &amp; Pieces|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hackaday.io/submissions/prize2015/list|title=The 2015 Hackaday Prize • Hackaday.io|website=hackaday.io|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmbot.io began [[preorder]]s of the first commercially available version of FarmBot, the FarmBot Genesis, the ninth iteration of the design in July 2016.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Farmbot Genesis ==

=== Capabilities ===
The FarmBot Genesis is able to plant over 30 different crops including [[potato]]es, [[pea]]s, [[Cucurbita|squash]], [[artichoke]]s and [[chard]] in an area of 2.9 meters × 1.4 meters with a maximum plant height of 0.5 meters.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://singularityhub.com/2015/12/15/how-a-robot-in-the-garden-might-replace-a-trip-to-whole-foods/|title=How a Robot in the Garden Might Save a Trip to Whole Foods|last=Networks|first=Brad TempletonBrad Templeton is Singularity University's|last2=of|first2=Computing Chair He is a developer|date=2015-12-15|website=Singularity HUB|access-date=2016-08-02|last3=Cars|first3=Commentator on Self-Driving|last4=Architect|first4=Software|last5=Foundation|first5=board member of the Electronic Frontier|last6=Entrepreneur|first6=Internet|last7=Lecturer|first7=Futurist|last8=writer|last9=Issues|first9=Observer of Cyberspace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/farmbot-genesis-seeds-waters-and-fertilizes-your-garden-with-life-giving-precision/|title=FarmBot Genesis seeds, waters, and fertilizes your garden with life-giving precision|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can cultivate a variety of crops within same area at the same time and is able to operate indoors, outdoors and covered areas.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It is estimated that the FarmBot Genesis produces 25% fewer [[carbon dioxide]] emissions than standard US food production.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Farmbot Genesis can perform almost all processes prior to harvesting including [[sowing]], mechanical [[weed control]] and [[Irrigation|watering]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It requires electricity, an internet connection and water supply which can be provided using off grid solutions including a water barrel to collect rain and a solar panel and battery to provide electricity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.arduino.cc/2016/06/07/farmbot-is-an-open-source-cnc-farming-machine/|title=Arduino Blog – FarmBot is an open-source CNC farming machine|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FarmBot Genesis is able to gather data to take into account factors such as age of the plant and local weather conditions from both local sensors and external data from the [[internet]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Software ====
The software for the FarmBot Genesis runs through a web interface allowing the machine to be controlled on most internet enabled devices. The web app has the ability to adjust different inputs including water, fertilizer and pesticide, seed spacing and environmental factors including soil and weather conditions based on sensor readings, location, and time of year. It is also able to build and schedule sequences by combining and altering basic operations.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The software is also able to manipulate data maps, real-time logging and access an open plant data in the OpenFarm database.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; All software is available under the [[MIT License|MIT license]] and is available on [[GitHub]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

'''Freemen-on-the-land''' (also '''freemen-of-the-land''', the '''freemen movement''' or simply '''freemen''') are a loose group of individuals who believe that they are bound by [[statute law]]s only if they consent to those laws. They believe that they can therefore declare themselves independent of the government and the [[rule of law]], holding that the only "true" law is their own interpretation of "[[common law]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Freemen movement captures Canadian police attention |last=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/freemen-movement-captures-canadian-police-attention-1.1262159 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date= 29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief has been described as a [[conspiracy theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Freemen of the dangerous nonsense|url = http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2011/11/15/freemen-of-the-dangerous-nonsense/|website = UK Human Rights Blog|accessdate = 9 December 2015|first = Adam|last = Wagner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freemen are active in [[English-speaking countries]]: the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, the United States, Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Shelly Stocked, [http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/the-seriously-weird-beliefs-of-freemen-on-the-land/news-story/cd91441f8f406a48457d5450b0a264f9 The seriously weird beliefs of Freemen on the land], ''[[news.com.au]]'', 9 July 2016.

In the Canadian court case ''Meads v. Meads'', [[Alberta Court of Queen's Bench]] Associate Chief Justice John D. Rooke used the phrase "Organised Pseudolegal Commercial Arguments" (OPCA) to describe the techniques and arguments used by freemen in court, describing them as frivolous and [[vexatious litigation|vexatious]].&lt;ref name="Wittmeier"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Edmonton+divorce+case+prompts+justice+dissect/7310855/story.html|title=Edmonton divorce case prompts justice to dissect "pseudolegal" arguments|last=Wittmeier|first=B|date=27 September 2012|work=[[Edmonton Journal]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003034131/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Edmonton+divorce+case+prompts+justice+dissect/7310855/story.html|archivedate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ablawg.ca/2012/10/30/the-organized-pseudolegal-commercial-argument-opca-litigant-case/ University of Calgary Faculty of Law]&lt;br&gt;- [http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/O/OrganizedPseudolegalCommercialArgumentLitigant.aspx Duhaime]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=meads-canlii /&gt; There is no recorded instance of freeman tactics being upheld in a court of law.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/18/freeman-land-strategy-bullet-debt |title=The freeman-on-the-land strategy is no magic bullet for debt problems |last1=Bizzle |first1=Legal |date=18 November 2011 |website=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt; In refuting each of the arguments used by Meads, Rooke concluded that "a decade of reported cases, many of which he refers to in his ruling, have failed to prove a single concept advanced by OPCA litigants."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianlawyermag.com/4463/The-scourge-of-unrepresented-litigants.html ''Canadian Lawyer'' magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs ==
Freemen believe that statute law is a contract, and that individuals can therefore opt out of statute law, choosing instead to live under what they call "common" (case) and "natural" laws. They believe natural laws require only that individuals do not harm others, do not damage the property of others, and do not use "fraud or mischief" in contracts. They say that all people have two parts to their existence: their body and their legal "person". The latter is represented by the individual's birth certificate; some freemen claim that it is entirely limited to the birth certificate. Under this theory, a "[[Strawman theory|strawman]]" is created when a birth certificate is issued, and this "strawman" is the entity who is subject to statutory law. The physical self is referred to by a slightly different name, such as "John of the family Smith" instead of "John Smith".&lt;ref name="Benchmark"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131216185721/http://judiciary.sut1.co.uk/docs/benchmark/benchmark_feb2012.pdf "Nonsense or loophole?"], ''Benchmark'', Issue 57, February 2012, p 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Many freemen beliefs are based on idiosyncratic interpretations of [[Admiralty law|admiralty or maritime law]], which the freemen claim govern the commercial world. These beliefs stem from fringe interpretations of various nautical-sounding words, such as ownership, citizenship, dock, or birth (berth) certificate. Freemen refer to the court as a "ship", the court's occupants as "passengers" and may claim that those leaving are "men overboard".&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

Freemen will try to claim common law (as opposed to admiralty law) jurisdiction by asking "Do you have a claim against me?" This, they contend, removes their consent to be governed by admiralty law and turns the court into a common law court, so that proceedings would have to go forward according to their version of common law. This procedure has never been successfully used.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

Freemen will often not accept legal representation, believing that to do so would mean contracting with the state. They believe that the United Kingdom and Canada are now operating in bankruptcy and are therefore under admiralty law. They believe that since the abolition of the gold standard, UK currency is backed not by gold but by the people (or the "legal fiction of their persons"). They describe persons as creditors of the UK corporation. Therefore, a court is a place of business, and a summons is an invitation to discuss the matter at hand, with no powers to require attendance or compliance.&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt; They may believe that the government controls secret bank accounts in their name as part of this theory, which may be accessed to pay off debts.

None of the beliefs held by freemen have ever been supported by any judgments or verdicts in any criminal or civil court cases anywhere.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt; An [[England and Wales|English]] solicitor, writing anonymously, commented:

{{quote|[This] strategy might give lenders pause, of course, because litigating against awkward characters isn't much fun. But given how flimsy the freeman legal arguments are, the pause needn't be long. I've seen a transcript of a hearing in which a debtor tried to rely on the freeman defence. It was over as soon as the judge asked (I can imagine the withering tone), ''"Are you planning to persist in this defence, Mr Jones?"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anonymous|title=The freeman-on-the-land strategy is no magic bullet for debt problems|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/18/freeman-land-strategy-bullet-debt|website=The Guardian|accessdate=20 June 2015}} Note: Author name withheld by request; a solicitor of England and Wales; wrote with permission pseudonymously as "Legal Bizzle"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Contracts ==
Freemen believe that since they exist in a common law [[jurisdiction]] where equality is paramount and mandatory, the people in the government and courts are not above the law, and that government and court personnel therefore must obtain the [[consent of the governed]]. Freemen believe that government employees who do not obtain consent of the governed have abandoned the rule of law. They believe this consent is routinely secured by way of people submitting applications and through acts of registration. They believe the public servants have deceived the population into abandoning their status as freemen in exchange for the status of a "child of the province" or "ward of the state", allowing those children to collect benefits such as welfare, unemployment insurance, and pension plans or old age security.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Freemen believe that the government has to establish "joinder" to link oneself and one's legal person. If one is asked whether one is "John Smith" and one says that is so, one has established joinder and connected the physical and human persons. The next step is to obtain consent. Statutes are merely invitations to enter a contract, and are only legally enforceable if one enters into the contract consensually. Otherwise, statute laws are not applicable. Freemen believe that the government is constantly trying to trick people into entering into a contract with them, so they often return bills, notices, summons and so on with the message "No contract—return to sender".&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

A "notice of understanding and intent and claim of right" is a document used by freemen to declare their sovereignty. The signed document, often [[notarised]], is sent to the Queen and possibly other authorities such as the Prime Minister and police chiefs. It usually begins with the words "Whereas it is my understanding" and goes on to state their understanding of the law and their lack of consent to it.&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

Freemen's beliefs are based on misunderstandings and wishful thinking and have not been successful in any courts anywhere.&lt;ref name="Benchmark" /&gt;

== Court cases ==
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Meads v. Meads]] --&gt;
*Dennis Larry Meads of [[Edmonton]], Alberta, stormed out of a hearing in the [[Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta]] on 8 June 2012, related to his divorce and matrimonial property case. In response, Associate Chief Justice John D. Rooke wrote a lengthy and comprehensive 185-page judgment rejecting various freemen claims, grouping them with other pseudolegal arguments as "Organized Pseudolegal Commercial Arguments" (OPCA), specifically, in this case, Meads' freeman on the land claims, arguments and documents, saying that:&lt;ref name="Wittmeier" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The bluntly idiotic substance of Mr. Mead's argument explains the unnecessarily complicated manner in which it was presented. OPCA arguments are never sold to their customers as simple ideas, but instead are byzantine schemes which more closely resemble the plot of a dark fantasy novel than anything else. Latin maxims and powerful sounding language are often used. Documents are often ornamented with many strange markings and seals. Litigants engage in peculiar, ritual‑like in court conduct. All these features appear necessary for gurus to market OPCA schemes to their often desperate, ill‑informed, mentally disturbed, or legally abusive customers. This is crucial to understand the non-substance of any OPCA concept or strategy. The story and process of a OPCA scheme is not intended to impress or convince the Courts, ''but rather to impress the guru's customer''.&lt;ref name="meads-canlii"&gt;''[http://canlii.ca/en/ab/abqb/doc/2012/2012abqb571/2012abqb571.html Meads v.

:In a subsequent ruling on another OPCA case, ''Gauthier v. Starr 2016 ABQB 213'', Justice Rooke noted that, following the ruling, Meads had abandoned OPCA strategies and concluded the litigation in an orderly fashion.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.is/20160419203650/http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2016/2016abqb213/2016abqb213.html Gauthier v Starr, 2016 ABQB 213]''  (CanLII), Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, 14 April 2016, para. 59&lt;/ref&gt;
* Elizabeth Watson came to public attention in 2011 as a self-styled legal adviser for Victoria Haigh in a (child) custody case; she was given a nine-month [[prison sentence]] for [[contempt of court]] (later suspended). She had defaced court documents by writing the words "no contract" and otherwise refused to accept or acknowledge the authority of a court of law, by amongst other things refusing to respond to the written legal notices or other correspondences from the court, and styled and addressed herself and Haigh in the irregular fashion as "Elizabeth of the Watson family" and "Victoria of the Haigh family" respectively, instead of their names in the normal and usual mode of rendering.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2011/B15.html# Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council and Elizabeth Watson and Victoria Haigh]'', Royal Courts of Justice, 22 August 2011, [2011] 3 FCR 422, [2011] Fam Law 1194, [2011] EWHC B15 (Fam)&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/local/investigator_jailed_for_report_as_court_contempt_compromised_well_being_of_child_1_3706219# "‘Investigator’ jailed for report as court contempt compromised well-being of child"], ''The Star'' (Sheffield), 24 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mark Bond of [[Norfolk]], England, was arrested in 2010 for non-payment of tax, despite handing police a "notice of intent" stating that he was no longer a UK citizen. He told police that the notice had already been delivered to the Queen and the prime minister. He told the ''[[Norwich Evening News]]'', "Today I asked the judge to walk into the court under common law and not commercial law. If I had entered under commercial law it would prove that I accepted its law. I was denied my rights to go in there." He was sentenced to three months custody, suspended on condition that he pay off the debt at £20 a week.&lt;ref&gt;David Bale, [http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/news/norfolk_tax_dodger_arrested_after_writing_to_queen_1_745681 "Norfolk tax dodger arrested... after writing to Queen"], ''Norwich Evening News'', 3 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bobby Sludds appeared in court in [[County Wexford]] in Ireland, charged with various motoring offences including two counts of no insurance. Before the police began to give evidence, the accused handed in a letter stating he was not Mr. Sludds but Bobby of the family Sludds and questioning the use of the word 'person' in the charge. He was given two suspended sentences and a fine of €670. (He had 24 previous convictions for motoring offences.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wexfordpeople.ie/news/bobby-of-the-family-sludds-may-be-jailed-2878029.html "'Bobby of the family Sludds' may be jailed"], ''Wexford People'', 14 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wilfred Keith Thompson and two others were arrested by police in [[Guelph]], Ontario, Canada, charged with breaking, entering and theft as well as firearms offences. Thompson had previously made headlines for informing City Hall, local police, Guelph MP [[Frank Valeriote]], Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] and other officials he is "an autonomous being not controlled by others". One of his co-defendants, Trevor "Red" De Block, refused to identify himself to the court, though it was said that his criminal mug shot, computer records, tattoos and other information confirmed his identity. "I object," De Block said, adding that he was not the "rightful owner" of his name, but refusing to clarify or participate in legal proceedings. "I don't bow down to bail .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. to false gods," he said, and rejected assistance from the appointed lawyer. Thompson and De Block were denied bail.&lt;ref&gt;Vik Kirsch, [https://www.guelphmercury.com/news-story/2778969-security-tight-as-suspects-in-guelph-break-in-case-appear-in-bail-court/ "Security tight as suspects in Guelph break-in case appear in bail court"], ''Guelph Mercury'', 5 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dean Marshall of [[Preston, East Riding of Yorkshire|Preston]], [[Holderness]], near [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire|East Yorkshire]], England, was taken to court after he was found to be growing 26 [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] plants in his garden shed. Claiming he was a freeman on the land and therefore not guilty, he then attempted to call up [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and (the prime minister) [[David Cameron]] as his witnesses, although he was told that neither was available to attend. A jury at Hull [[Crown Court]] dismissed his claims and convicted him of conspiracy to produce cannabis for which he was given a 12-month prison sentence, suspended upon entering into a good behaviour bond for two years, and was ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Cannabis-grower-tried-Queen-Prime-Minister/story-16717687-detail/story.html "Cannabis-grower tried to call Queen and Prime Minister as witnesses in 'bizarre' trial"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817235748/http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Cannabis-grower-tried-Queen-Prime-Minister/story-16717687-detail/story.html |date=17 August 2012 }}, ''Hull Daily Mail'', 16 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Doug Jones of [[Pembroke Dock]], Pembrokeshire, Wales, spent 22 days in prison after refusing to take a breath test. Jones questioned the authority and jurisdiction of the court, asking to see the judge's 'Oath of Office' which resulted in a sentence of fourteen days for [[contempt of court]]. He was sentenced to a further seven days after failing to attend a second hearing, but pleaded guilty to the original charges, receiving [[List of UK driving licence endorsements|an endorsement on his driving licence]]. His interest in the freemen on the land movement started after watching documentaries on conspiracy theories surrounding the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London bombings]].  His solicitor, Phillipa Ashworth, stated "On this occasion, in hindsight he appreciates it was not the time to test out philosophical theories behind this approach to life, and in hindsight it isn't something he would do again."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/news/9918044.Jail_for_man_who_refused__to_be_governed_/?ref=rss "Magna Carta beliefs lead to 22 days jail for Pembrokeshire businessman who refused 'to be governed'"], ''Western Telegraph'', 7 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gavin Kaylhem of [[Grimsby]], [[North East Lincolnshire]], England, wilfully refused to pay his [[council tax]] debts of £1,268.54 accrued between 2001 and 2008 and was sentenced to 30 days' imprisonment. He had claimed that he was a "freeman" and thus had no contractual duty under common law to pay. He refused to co-operate with [[Magistrates of England and Wales|magistrates]]' questions.&lt;ref&gt;North East Lincolnshire Council, [http://www.nelincs.gov.uk/news/2011/dec/council-tax-evader-jailed-30-days/ "Council tax evader jailed for 30 days"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211022928/http://www.nelincs.gov.uk/news/2011/dec/council-tax-evader-jailed-30-days/ |date=11 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mandeep Sandhu of [[Tividale]], [[Sandwell]], West Midlands, was stopped by police while driving a car that was insured to a woman. He refused to give his details to the officers, saying that to do so would mean "entering into a contract he could not afford to fulfil". He refused to co-operate at the police station and when brought before Sandwell Magistrates' Court, in October 2015, Sandhu was convicted of driving without insurance and obstructing police and was also found in contempt of court. He was sentenced to 14 days in prison for the contempt, and ordered to pay £330 in fines for the insurance charge with court costs and had 6 points added to his licence. A spokesperson for West Midlands Police said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/freeman-land-driver-jailed-contempt-10253089|title='Freeman-of-the-Land' driver jailed for contempt of court|work=The Birmingham Mail|date=13 October 2015|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;br /&gt;- {{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2015/10/13/freeman-driver-who-refused-to-talk-to-police-jailed/|title='Freeman' driver who refused to talk to police jailed|work=Express &amp; Star|date=13 October 2015|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The whole process meant that a simple matter of driving without insurance took up hours of police time – and ultimately a stint behind bars after being convicted of contempt of court while defending himself. We hope this case acts as a warning that to obstruct the police and the courts is not a wise move.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Errol Denton, a [[live blood analysis]] practitioner, was charged with offences under the [[Cancer Act 1939]]. At Westminster Magistrates' Court, he used a freeman defence. Since both the prosecution and the defence were rare, it was reported in the press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/freeman-on-the-land-causes-chaos-in-court-1-3715573 "‘Freeman on the land’ causes chaos in court"], ''Edinburgh Evening News'', 11 March 2015&lt;br /&gt;- [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10510345/Harley-Street-practitioner-claimed-he-could-cure-cancer-and-HIV-with-lifestyle-changes-and-herbs-court-hears.html "Harley Street practitioner claimed he could cure cancer and HIV with lifestyle changes and herbs, court hears"], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 11 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March 2014 he was convicted on all nine counts and fined £9,000 plus around £10,000 in costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/10732023/Duped-by-the-blood-analyst-who-says-he-can-cure-cancer.html |title=Duped by the 'blood analyst' who says he can cure cancer |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=30 March 2014 |first=Robert |last=Mendick |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402094151/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/10732023/Duped-by-the-blood-analyst-who-says-he-can-cure-cancer.html |archivedate=2 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;br&gt;- [https://web.archive.org/web/20140321025146/http://www.edp24.co.uk/mobile/news/crime/woodford_green_harley_street_worker_handed_19k_court_bill_after_claiming_he_could_cure_cancer_and_hiv_with_lifestyle_changes_1_3459178 "Woodford Green Harley Street worker handed 19k court bill after claiming he could cure cancer and HIV with lifestyle change"], ''Eastern Daily Press'', 20 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Powell was the third of four sons of John ap Hywel of [[Llansawel]], [[Carmarthenshire]], [[Wales]].  Powell matriculated at Jesus College in 1581, obtaining his BA in 1584, MA in 1589, and BCL in 1593.&lt;ref name =ODNB&gt;{{cite web| first=Barrie |last= Williams| title=Powell, Griffith (1560/61&amp;ndash;1620)| work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] (online edition) (subscription access) |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22649| accessdate=17 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected Fellow of the college in 1589.&lt;ref name="WBO Powell"/&gt; He effectively ran the college during the principalships of his two predecessors, [[Francis Bevans]] and [[John Williams (college principal)|John Williams]]. Williams deprived him of his Fellowship, but it was restored on the Chancellor's orders.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite book| title=Jesus College 1571&amp;ndash;1971 |last=Baker| first=J. N.

Powell wrote two volumes on [[Aristotle|Aristotelian philosophy]], ''Analysis analyticorum posteriorum'' (1594) and ''De sophisticis elenchis'' (1598).&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  He was awarded his DCL in 1599.&lt;ref name="WBO Powell"/&gt;  During his time as Principal he "requested" various "worthy personages" to contribute to the construction of college buildings, in particular the chapel, hall, buttery and kitchen, and raised £838 12s 2d: £259 from merchants and gentry of London, £160 from citizens of Oxford, £341 from people in Wales and the borders, and £78 from seven members of the clergy in Wales ([[Richard Parry (bishop)|Richard Parry]], [[Bishop of St Asaph]], giving £66 13s 2d of this sum).&lt;ref&gt;Baker, ''Jesus College'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; The hall still retains the panelling, three tables and two benches from the time of this work.&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt; His careful approach to college finances also made it possible to increase the numbers of resident fellows and scholars, and the popularity of the college with students from South Wales in particular increased during his time as Principal.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

He died in 1620 and was buried in the Church of [[St Michael at the Northgate]] near the College.&lt;ref name="WBO Powell"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-POWE-GRI-1561.html| title= POWELL, GRIFFITH (1561 - 1620), principal of Jesus College, Oxford | first= Idris Llewelyn |last= Foster| authorlink=Idris Foster | work=Welsh Biography Online |publisher= [[National Library of Wales]] |accessdate=17 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left his whole estate to the college; lands in [[Flintshire]] were bought with the proceeds, and these remained in college ownership until 1966.&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt; The college chapel was completed within a year of his death.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1064">'''Immanent evaluation''' is a [[philosophical]] concept used by [[Gilles Deleuze]] in his essay "Qu'est-ce qu'un dispositif ?" (1989), where it is seen as the opposite of [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] [[judgment (philosophy)|judgment]].

Deleuze writes about [[Michel Foucault]]: "Foucault ... makes allusion to 'aesthetic' criteria, which are understood as criteria for life and replace on each occasion the claims of transcendental {{sic}} judgement [''jugement transcendant''] with an immanent evaluation [''évaluation immanente'']".&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Deleuze. 1992.

'''José Ferrater Mora''' or Josep Ferrater i Mora (in Catalan) (30 October 1912 – 30 January 1991) was a Spanish philosopher. He was the author of over 35 books, including a four-volume ''Diccionario de filosofía'' (Dictionary of Philosophy, 1944) and ''Being and Death: An Outline of Integrationist Philosophy'' (1962).&lt;ref name=centre&gt;[http://www.oxfordanimalethics.com/about-the-centre/jose-ferrater-mora/ "José Ferrater Mora"], Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics, accessed 25 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

He became known for his inclusion of humans and non-human animals within the same moral sphere, or continuum, arguing that the difference was one of degree, not kind.  The [[Ferrater Mora Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics]] is named after him.&lt;ref name=centre/&gt;

[[Image:Kim Si-seup.jpg|thumb|right|Kim Shi-Sup.]]
'''Kim Si-seup''' (1435–1493) was a [[Korea]]n [[scholar]] and [[author]].

==Background==
Kim Si-seup's ancestors originally came from [[Gangneung]], [[Gangwon (historical)|Gangwon-do]].  His family was from the [[yangban]] class and Kim himself was born in [[Seoul]].

Throughout his life, Kim maintained a special bond with the Gangwon area and compiled a book of poetry called ''[[Tangyugwandongnok]]'' which was based on family history and experiences he had in the area. Kim was an extremely gifted child and had picked up reading ability at eight months of age. At five years of age, he was able to read and comprehend [[The Great Learning]] and the [[Doctrine of the Mean]]. Kim was a devout Buddhist and at twenty-one years of age protesting [[King Sejo]] usurping of the throne from his nephew [[Danjong of Joseon]] (eventually murdering him), he decided to skip government service and become a Buddhist monk.

==Works==
Kim wrote the first novel in [[Classical chinese]] in [[Korea]], titled [[Geumo Sinhwa]] (금오신화; 金鰲新話), as well as other books such as [[Siphyeondamyohae]], [[Tangyugwanseorok]], and [[Tangyuhonamnok]]. Geumo Sinhwa (New stories from Mount Geumo) was likely composed at [[Yongjang Temple]] during the reign of [[King Sejong]]&lt;ref&gt;''Han'guk ŭi kojŏn ŭl ingnŭnda'' 한국의 고전을 읽는다 [Reading Korea's classics], vol. 2, ''Kojŏn munhak chung: Yet sosŏl, yet norae'' 고전문학 中: 옛소설•옛노래 [Classical literature II: Old fiction, old songs], by Kim Chongch’ŏl 김종철, Sŏ Chiyŏng 서지영, Song Sŏnguk 송성욱, et al. (Seoul: Hyumŏnisŭt’ŭ, 2006), 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; and became an instant classic. Although [[Geumosinhwa]] was influenced by a Chinese novel titled ''[[Jiandeng Xinhua]]'' (New stories while trimming the lampwick) by [[Qu You]], it would become nativized and later have considerable influence on [[Japanese literature|Japanese novels]].

Another characteristic lies in his own writing. He did not prefer only Confucianism and tried to deal with Buddhism. It appeared in several books of his that the king and subjects should respect the whole nation regardless of a person's status and origin. It was believed his thought was much advanced compared to the era in which he lived and remained one of the earliest ideas concerning [[democracy]] on the Korean peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Translated from data of Ministry of Culture of Korea http://person.mct.go.kr/person/data/person_view.jsp?cp_seq=100&lt;/ref&gt;

When he died there was a government effort to find and preserve all of his works, which number around 30 volumes. Below is an example of his poetry:

:Do not sweep the fallen leaves,
:For they are pleasant to hear on clear nights
:In the wind, they rustle, as if sighing;
:In the moonlight, their shadows flutter.
:They knock on the window to wake a traveler;
:Covering stairs, they hide moss.
:Sad, the sight of them getting wet in the rain;
:Let them wither away deep in the mountains.

{{Platonism|dialogues=show}}

The '''''Laws''''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Νόμοι, ''Nómoi''; [[Latin]]: ''De Legibus''&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Estienne]] (ed.), ''Platonis opera quae extant omnia'', Vol. 2, 1578, [https://archive.org/stream/platonisoperaqua02plat#page/702/mode/2up p. 703].&lt;/ref&gt;) is [[Plato]]'s last and longest [[dialogue]].  The conversation depicted in the work's twelve books begins with the question of who is given the credit for establishing a civilization's [[law]]s. Its musings on the ethics of government and law have established it as a classic of [[political philosophy]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} alongside Plato's more widely read ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.

Scholars generally agree that Plato wrote this dialogue as an older man, having failed in his effort in [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] on the island of [[Sicily]] to guide a tyrant's rule, instead having been thrown in prison. These events are alluded to in the ''[[Seventh Letter (Plato)|Seventh Letter]]''.  The text is noteworthy as Plato's only undisputed dialogue not to feature [[Socrates]].

==Summary==

===Setting===
Unlike most of Plato's dialogues, Socrates does not appear in the ''Laws'': the dialogue takes place on the island of [[Crete]], and Socrates appears outside of Athens in Plato's writings only twice, in the ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', where he is just outside the city's walls, and in the ''Republic'', where he goes down to the seaport [[Piraeus]] five miles outside of Athens. The conversation is instead led by an [[Athens|Athenian]] Stranger (in Greek, ξένος ''xenos'') and two other old men, the ordinary [[Sparta]]n citizen Megillos and the Cretan politician and lawgiver Clinias from [[Knossos]].

The Athenian Stranger, who resembles Socrates but whose name is never mentioned, joins the other two on their religious pilgrimage from Knossos to the cave of [[Zeus]]. The entire dialogue takes place during this journey, which mimics the action of [[Minos]]: said by the Cretans to have made their ancient laws, Minos walked this path every nine years in order to receive instruction from Zeus on lawgiving. It is also said to be the longest day of the year, allowing for the densely packed twelve chapters.

By the end of the third book Clinias announces that he has in fact been given the responsibility of creating the laws for a new Cretan colony, and that he would like the Stranger's assistance. The rest of the dialogue proceeds with the three old men, walking towards the cave and making laws for this new city which is called the city of the Magnetes (or Magnesia).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0166:book=8:section=848d&amp;highlight=magnetes Plato, ''Laws''. Book VIII, 848D]. "And if there exist any local deities of the Magnetes or any shrines of ancient gods whose memory is still preserved, we shall pay to them the same worship as did the men of old. ...". A footnote in the [[Loeb Classical Library]] 1926 edition, translated by [[Robert Gregg Bury|R.G. Bury]], says: "The original inhabitants of the site of Clinias's new colony (cp. 702 B, 860 E); they subsequently migrated to Magnesia in Asia Minor".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Virginia, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2137376&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S0017383508000521 "Plato's Prisons"], in ''Greece &amp; Rome'' journal, v.55, n.2, October 2008, pp.193-201&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topics===
The question asked at the beginning is not "What is law?" as one would expect. That is the question of the apocryphal Platonic dialogue ''[[Minos (dialogue)|Minos]]''. The dialogue rather proceeds from the question of who it is that receives credit for creating laws.

The questions of the ''Laws'' are quite numerous, including:
*Divine revelation, divine law and law-giving
*The role of intelligence in law-giving
*The relations of philosophy, religion, and politics
*The role of music, exercise and dance in education
*Natural law and natural right

The dialogue uses primarily the Athenian and Spartan (Lacedaemonian) law systems as background for pinpointing a choice of laws, which the speakers imagine as a more or less coherent set for the new city they are talking about.

==Comparisons==

===Comparisons to Plato's other dialogues===
{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}
The ''Laws'' is similar to and yet in opposition to the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. It is similar in that both dialogues concern the making of a city in speech. The city of the ''Laws'' is described as "second best", not because the city of the ''Republic'' is the best, but because it is the city of gods and their children. The city of the ''Laws'' differs in its allowance of private property and private families, and in the very existence of written laws, from the city of the ''Republic,'' with its property-system and community of wives for the guardians, and absence of written law. Also, whereas the ''Republic'' is a dialogue between Socrates and several young men, the ''Laws'' is a discussion among old men, where children are not allowed and there is always a pretense of piety and ritualism.

Traditionally, the ''Minos'' is thought to be the preface, and the ''[[Epinomis]]'' the epilogue, to the ''Laws'', but these are generally considered by scholars to be spurious.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Cooper in Plato, ''Complete Works''.  Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;


===Comparisons to other works on Greek law===
Plato was not the only [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] author writing about the law systems of his day, and making comparisons between the [[Athens|Athenian]] and the [[Sparta]]n laws.  Notably, the ''Constitution of the Spartans'' by [[Xenophon]], the ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Pseudo-Xenophon)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'', wrongly attributed to Xenophon, and the ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'', possibly by [[Aristotle]] or one of his students, have also survived.

Some centuries later [[Plutarch]] would also devote attention to the topic of Ancient Greek law systems, e.g. in his ''Life of Lycurgus''. [[Lycurgus (Sparta)|Lycurgus]] was the legendary law-giver of the Lacedaemonians. Plutarch compares Lycurgus and his Spartan laws to the law system [[Numa Pompilius]] introduced in [[Rome]] around 700 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''[[Parallel Lives|Plutarch's Lives]]''.  Nabu Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both pseudo-Xenophon and Plutarch are stark admirers of the Spartan system, showing less reserve than Plato in expressing that admiration.

'''Lazarus Geiger''' (21 May 1829 – 29 August 1870) was a German Jewish philosopher and [[philologist]].

==Life==
He was born at [[Frankfurt-on-Main]], was destined to commerce, but soon gave himself up to scholarship and studied at [[University of Marburg|Marburg]], [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] and [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]]. From 1861 till his sudden death in 1870 he was professor in the Jewish high school at Frankfurt. His chief aim was to prove that the evolution of human reason is closely bound up with that of language. He further maintained that the origin of the [[Indo-Germanic]] language is to be sought not in Asia but in central (Germany). He was a convinced opponent of [[rationalism]] in religion.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=551}}

{{quote|It was Lazarus Geiger, ... who first detected universal sequence in the acquisition of basic colour terms.{{sfn|Berlin|Kay|1991|p=135 }}}}

==Bibliography==
Lazarus Geiger's chief work was ''Ursprung und Entwickelung der menschlichen Sprache und Vernunft'' (vol. i., Stuttgart, 1868), the principal results of which appeared in a more popular form as ''Der Ursprung der Sprache'' (Stuttgart, 1869 and 1878). The second volume of the former was published in an incomplete form (1872, 2nd ed. 1899) after his death by his brother Alfred Geiger.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=551}}

Alfred Geiger also published a number of Lazarus Geiger's scattered papers as ''Zur Entwickelung der Menschheit'' (1871, and ed. 1878; Eng. trans. D. Asher, ''Hist. of the Development of the Human Race'', London, 1880).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=551}}

'''Love''' encompasses a variety of strong and positive emotional and mental states, ranging from the most sublime [[virtue]] or good habit, the deepest [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal]] [[affection]] and to the simplest [[pleasure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/love |title=Definition of Love in English |publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |accessdate=May 1, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/love#translations |title=Definition of "Love" - English Dictionary |publisher=[[Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary|Cambridge English Dictionary]] |accessdate=May 1, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love of food. Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of strong attraction and emotional [[attachment (psychology)|attachment]].&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;''Oxford Illustrated American Dictionary'' (1998) + ''Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Love can also be a [[virtue]] representing human [[kindness]], [[compassion]], and affection, as "the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/love|title=Love - Definition of love by Merriam-Webster|website=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self or animals.&lt;ref name="Fromm, Erich 1956"&gt;Fromm, Erich; ''The Art of Loving'', Harper Perennial (1956), Original English Version, {{ISBN|978-0-06-095828-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Love in its various forms acts as a major facilitator of [[interpersonal relationship]]s and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the [[creative arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article On Love |url=http://www.slideshare.net/azharabbas/just-love |accessdate=13 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530043739/http://www.slideshare.net/azharabbas/just-love |archivedate=30 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Love has been postulated to be a function to keep human beings together against menaces and to [[human reproduction|facilitate the continuation of the species]].&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;Helen Fisher. ''Why We Love: the nature and chemistry of romantic love''. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Greek philosophers identified [[Greek words for love|five forms of love]]: essentially, [[familial love]] (in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], ''{{lang|grc-Latn|[[Storge]]}}''), [[friendship|friendly love]] (''{{lang|grc-Latn|[[Philia]]}}''),  [[romance (love)|romantic love]] ({{lang|grc-Latn|[[Eros (concept)|Eros]]}}), [[hospitality|guest love]] ({{lang|grc-Latn|[[Xenia (Greek)|Xenia]]}}) and [[divine|divine love]] ({{lang|grc-Latn|[[Agape]]}}). Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of love: [[unrequited love]], [[limerence|infatuated love]], [[amour de soi|self-love]], and [[courtly love]]. Asian cultures have also distinguished ''{{lang|zh-Latn|[[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]]}}'', ''{{lang|sa-Latn|[[Kama]]}}'', ''{{lang|sa-Latn|[[Bhakti]]}}'', ''{{lang|sa-Latn|[[Mettā]]}}'', ''{{lang|ar-Latn|[[Ishq]]}}'', ''{{lang|he-Latn|[[Chesed]]}}'', and other [[Religious views on love|variants or symbioses of these states]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Liddell and Scott]]: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfili%2Fa φιλία]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gita"&gt;{{cite book |last= Mascaró |first=Juan |title=The Bhagavad Gita |publisher=Penguin|series=Penguin Classics |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-14-044918-1}} (J. Mascaró, translator)&lt;/ref&gt; Love has additional [[religion|religious]] or [[spiritual but not religious|spiritual]] meaning. This diversity of uses and meanings combined with the complexity of the feelings involved makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states.

==Definitions==

The word "love" can have a variety of related but distinct meanings in different contexts. Many other languages use multiple words to express some of the different concepts that in English are denoted as "love"; one example is the plurality of [[Greek words for love|Greek words for "love"]] which includes ''agape'' and ''eros''.&lt;ref&gt;Anders Nygren, ''Agape and Eros''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural identity|Cultural differences]] in conceptualizing love thus doubly impede the establishment of a universal definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kay|first=Paul|title=What is the Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis?|journal=American Anthropologist|series=New Series|volume=86|issue=1|date=March 1984|pages=65–79|doi=10.1525/aa.1984.86.1.02a00050|last2=Kempton|first2=Willett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the nature or [[essence]] of love is a subject of frequent debate, different aspects of the word can be clarified by determining what ''isn't'' love (antonyms of "love"). Love as a general expression of positive sentiment (a stronger form of ''like'') is commonly contrasted with [[hate]] (or neutral [[apathy]]). As a less sexual and more [[Emotional intimacy|emotionally intimate]] form of romantic attachment, love is commonly contrasted with [[lust]]. As an interpersonal relationship with romantic overtones, love is sometimes contrasted with [[friendship]], although the word ''love'' is often applied to close friendships or platonic love. (Further possible ambiguities come with usages "girlfriend", "boyfriend", "just good friends").

[[File:Columpio Veracruz 059.jpg|thumb|left|Fraternal love (Prehispanic sculpture from 250–900 AD, of [[Huastec civilization|Huastec]] origin). [[Museo de Antropología de Xalapa|Museum of Anthropology]] in [[Xalapa]], [[Veracruz]], [[Mexico]]]] Abstractly discussed ''love'' usually refers to an experience one person feels for another. Love often involves caring for, or identifying with, a person or thing (cf. [[vulnerability and care theory of love]]), including oneself (cf. [[narcissism]]). In addition to cross-cultural differences in understanding love, ideas about love have also changed greatly over time. Some historians date modern conceptions of romantic love to courtly Europe during or after [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]], although the prior existence of romantic attachments is attested by ancient love poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The complex and abstract nature of love often reduces discourse of love to a [[thought-terminating cliché]]. Several common [[proverb]]s regard love, from [[Virgil]]'s "[[Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)|Love conquers all]]" to [[The Beatles]]' "[[All You Need Is Love]]". [[St. Thomas Aquinas]], following [[Aristotle]], defines love as "to will the good of another."&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2026.htm#article4 |title=St. Thomas Aquinas, STh I-II, 26, 4, corp. art |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] describes love as a condition of "absolute value," as opposed to [[relative value (economics)|relative value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Rtpak6zyOmYC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=bertrand+russell+love+%22absolute+value%22#v=onepage&amp;q=bertrand%20russell%20love%20%22absolute%20value%22&amp;f=false|title=Love|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] said that love is "to be delighted by the happiness of another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''Discourses''. Myrtle Beach: Sheriar Press. p. 113. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist [[Jeremy Griffith]] defines love as "unconditional selflessness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldtransformation.com/what-is-love/ ''What is love?''.

==Impersonal love==
People can be said to love an object, principle, or goal to which they are deeply committed and greatly value. For example, compassionate outreach and volunteer workers' "love" of their cause may sometimes be born not of interpersonal love but impersonal love, [[altruism]], and strong spiritual or political convictions.&lt;ref name="Fromm, Erich 2000"&gt;Fromm, Erich; ''The Art of Loving'', Harper Perennial (5 September 2000), Original English Version, {{ISBN|978-0-06-095828-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; People can also "love" material objects, animals, or activities if they invest themselves in bonding or otherwise identifying with those things. If sexual passion is also involved, then this feeling is called [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DiscoveryHealth |first= |title=Paraphilia |url=http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/paraphilia.html |accessdate=16 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212105714/http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/paraphilia.html |archivedate=12 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Love of Life (disambiguation)|common]] principle that people say they love is [[life]] itself.

==Interpersonal love==
Interpersonal love refers to love between human beings. It is a much more potent sentiment than a simple ''liking'' for a person. [[Unrequited love]] refers to those feelings of love that are not reciprocated. Interpersonal love is most closely associated with [[interpersonal relationships]].&lt;ref name="Fromm, Erich 2000"/&gt; Such love might exist between family members, friends, and couples. There are also a number of psychological disorders related to love, such as [[erotomania]].
[[File:Gothaer Liebespaar.jpg|thumb|180px|''Pair of Lovers''. 1480–1485]]
Throughout history, [[philosophy]] and [[religion]] have done the most speculation on the phenomenon of love. In the 20th century, the science of [[psychology]] has written a great deal on the subject. In recent years, the sciences of [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[biology]] have added to the understanding the concept of love.

===Biological basis===
{{Main|Biological basis of love}}
Biological models of sex tend to view love as a [[mammal]]ian drive, much like [[hunger]] or [[thirst]].&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = Thomas |author2=Amini, F. |author3=Lannon, R. | title = A General Theory of Love | publisher = Random House | year = 2000 |isbn=978-0-375-70922-7| title-link = A General Theory of Love }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helen Fisher (anthropologist)|Helen Fisher]], an anthropologist and human behavior researcher, divides the experience of love into three partly overlapping stages: lust, attraction, and attachment. Lust is the feeling of [[sexual desire]]; romantic attraction determines what partners mates find attractive and pursue, conserving time and energy by choosing; and attachment involves sharing a home, parental duties, mutual defense, and in humans involves feelings of safety and security.&lt;ref name="brain systems"&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://homepage.mac.com/helenfisher/archives_of_sex_beh.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=3 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628051603/http://homepage.mac.com/helenfisher/archives_of_sex_beh.pdf |archivedate=28 June 2011 |df= }} Defining the Brain Systems of Lust, Romantic Attraction,
and Attachment by Fisher et. al&lt;/ref&gt; Three distinct neural circuitries, including neurotransmitters, and three behavioral patterns, are associated with these three romantic styles.&lt;ref name="brain systems" /&gt;

[[Lust]] is the initial passionate sexual desire that promotes [[Mating (human)|mating]], and involves the increased release of chemicals such as [[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]]. These effects rarely last more than a few weeks or months. [[Interpersonal attraction|Attraction]] is the more individualized and romantic desire for a specific candidate for mating, which develops out of lust as commitment to an individual mate forms. Recent studies in [[neuroscience]] have indicated that as people fall in love, the brain consistently releases a certain set of chemicals, including the [[neuroendocrine|neurotransmitter hormones]], [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[serotonin]], the same compounds released by [[amphetamine]], stimulating the brain's [[pleasure center]] and leading to side effects such as increased [[heart rate]], loss of [[Anorexia (symptom)|appetite]] and [[insomnia|sleep]], and an [[euphoria|intense feeling of excitement]]. Research has indicated that this stage generally lasts from one and a half to three years.&lt;ref name="human"&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=978-0-03-093780-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the lust and attraction stages are both considered temporary, a third stage is needed to account for long-term relationships. [[Attachment theory|Attachment]] is the [[human bonding|bonding]] that promotes relationships lasting for many years and even decades. Attachment is generally based on commitments such as [[marriage]] and [[children]], or on mutual friendship based on things like shared interests. It has been linked to higher levels of the chemicals [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]] to a greater degree than short-term relationships have.&lt;ref name="human"/&gt; [[Enzo Emanuele]] and coworkers reported the protein molecule known as the [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) has high levels when people first fall in love, but these return to previous levels after one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Emanuele, E.|author2=Polliti, P. |author3=Bianchi, M. |author4=Minoretti, P. |author5=Bertona, M. |author6= Geroldi, D.|year=2005|title=Raised plasma nerve growth factor levels associated with early-stage romantic love|url=http://www.biopsychiatry.com/lovengf.htm|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2005.09.002|volume= 31|pmid=16289361 |issue=3 |pages=288–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sri Lankan woman and child.jpg|thumb|Grandmother and grandchild in [[Sri Lanka]]]]
[[Psychology]] depicts love as a cognitive and social phenomenon. [[Psychologist]] [[Robert Sternberg]] formulated a [[triangular theory of love]] and argued that love has three different components: intimacy, commitment, and passion. Intimacy is a form in which two people share confidences and various details of their personal lives, and is usually shown in friendships and romantic or platonic love affairs. Commitment, on the other hand, is the expectation that the relationship is permanent. The last form of love is sexual attraction and passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. All forms of love are viewed as varying combinations of these three components. Non-love does not include any of these components. Liking only includes intimacy. Infatuated love only includes passion. Empty love only includes commitment. Romantic love includes both intimacy and passion. Companionate love includes intimacy and commitment. Fatuous love includes passion and commitment. Lastly, consummate love includes all three components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sternberg| first= R. J. |year=1986| title=A triangular theory of love| journal=Psychological Review|volume= 93 |issue=2|pages= 119–135| doi=10.1037/0033-295X.93.2 | doi-broken-date= 2018-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American psychologist [[Zick Rubin]] sought to define ''love'' by [[psychometrics]] in the 1970s. His work states that three factors constitute love: attachment, caring, and intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Zick|title=Measurement of Romantic Love|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=16|pages=265–27{{clarify|date=June 2014}}|year=1970|doi=10.1037/h0029841|pmid=5479131|issue=2|citeseerx=10.1.1.452.3207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Zick|title=Liking and Loving: an invitation to social psychology|location=New York|publisher=Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following developments in electrical theories such as [[Coulomb's law]], which showed that positive and negative charges attract, analogs in human life were developed, such as "opposites attract". Over the last century, research on the nature of human mating has generally found this not to be true when it comes to character and personality—people tend to like people similar to themselves. However, in a few unusual and specific domains, such as [[immune system]]s, it seems that humans prefer others who are unlike themselves (e.g., with an orthogonal immune system), since this will lead to a baby that has the best of both worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berscheid | first = Ellen | authorlink = Ellen S. Berscheid |author2=Walster, Elaine H. | title = Interpersonal Attraction | publisher = Addison-Wesley Publishing Co | year = 1969 | id = CCCN 69-17443 | isbn = 978-0-201-00560-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, various [[human bonding]] theories have been developed, described in terms of attachments, ties, bonds, and affinities.
Some Western authorities disaggregate into two main components, the altruistic and the narcissistic. This view is represented in the works of [[M. Scott Peck|Scott Peck]], whose work in the field of [[applied psychology]] explored the definitions of love and evil. Peck maintains that love is a combination of the "concern for the spiritual growth of another," and simple narcissism.&lt;ref name="peck"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Road Less Traveled | isbn=978-0-671-25067-6 | last=Peck | first=Scott | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster | year=1978 | page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In combination, love is an ''activity'', not simply a feeling.
{{Close Relationships|emotions}}

Psychologist [[Erich Fromm]] maintained in his book ''[[The Art of Loving]]'' that love is not merely a feeling but is also actions, and that in fact, the "feeling" of love is superficial in comparison to one's commitment to love via a series of loving actions over time.&lt;ref name="Fromm, Erich 2000"/&gt; In this sense, Fromm held that love is ultimately not a feeling at all, but rather is a commitment to, and adherence to, loving actions towards another, oneself, or many others, over a sustained duration.&lt;ref name="Fromm, Erich 2000"/&gt; Fromm also described love as a conscious choice that in its early stages might originate as an involuntary feeling, but which then later no longer depends on those feelings, but rather depends only on conscious commitment.&lt;ref name="Fromm, Erich 2000"/&gt;

===Evolutionary basis===
[[File:Place des Abbesse (the plaque with the je t'aime=te iubesc in 311 laguages).jpg|thumb|''[[Wall of Love]]'' on [[Montmartre]] in Paris: "I love you" in 250 languages]]

[[Evolutionary psychology]] has attempted to provide various reasons for love as a survival tool. Humans are dependent on parental help for a large portion of their lifespans compared to other mammals. Love has therefore been seen as a mechanism to promote parental support of children for this extended time period. Furthermore, researchers as early as [[Charles Darwin]] himself identified unique features of human love compared to other mammals and credit love as a major factor for creating social support systems that enabled the development and expansion of the human species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Darwin's Lost Theory of Love: A Healing Vision for the 21st Century |last= Loye|first= David S. |year= 2000|publisher= iUniverse|location= |isbn= 978-0595001316|oclc= |page= 332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor may be that [[sexually transmitted disease]]s can cause, among other effects, permanently reduced [[fertility]], injury to the fetus, and increase complications during [[childbirth]]. This would favor monogamous relationships over [[polygamy]].&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by David M. Buss, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2005. Chapter 14, Commitment, Love, and Mate Retention by Lorne Campbell and Bruce J. Ellis.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of scientific models===
Biological models of love tend to see it as a mammalian drive, similar to [[hunger]] or [[thirst]].&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt; Psychology sees love as more of a social and cultural phenomenon. Certainly love is influenced by [[hormone]]s (such as [[oxytocin]]), [[neurotrophins]] (such as [[nerve growth factor|NGF]]), and [[pheromone]]s, and how people think and behave in love is influenced by their conceptions of love. The conventional view in [[biology]] is that there are two major drives in love: [[sexual attraction]] and [[attachment theory|attachment]]. Attachment between adults is presumed to work on the same principles that lead an infant to become attached to its mother. The traditional psychological view sees love as being a combination of [[companionate love]] and passionate love. Passionate love is intense longing, and is often accompanied by [[physiological arousal]] (shortness of breath, rapid heart rate); companionate love is affection and a feeling of intimacy not accompanied by physiological arousal.

==Cultural views==
===Ancient Greek===
{{See also|Greek words for love}}
[[File:Eros bow Musei Capitolini MC410.jpg|thumb|Roman copy of a Greek sculpture by [[Lysippus]] depicting [[Eros]], the Greek personification of romantic love]]
[[Greek language|Greek]] distinguishes [[Greek words for love|several different senses]] in which the word "love" is used. Ancient Greeks identified four forms of love: kinship or [[familial love|familiarity]] (in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], ''[[storge]]''), [[friendship]] and/or [[platonic love|platonic desire]] (''[[philia]]''), sexual and/or [[romance (love)|romantic desire]] (''[[eros (concept)|eros]]''), and [[Kenosis|self-emptying]] or divine love (''[[agape]]'').&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, ''[[The Four Loves]]'', 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PlatonicSchool"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kristeller |first=Paul Oskar |title=Renaissance Thought and the Arts: Collected Essays |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-691-02010-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of romantic love.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stendhal]], in his book ''On Love'' ("De l'amour"; Paris, 1822), distinguished carnal love, passionate love, a kind of uncommitted love that he called "taste-love", and love of vanity. [[Denis de Rougemont]] in his book ''Love in the Western World'' traced the story of passionate love (''l'amour-passion'') from its courtly to its romantic forms. [[Benjamin Péret]], in the introduction to his ''Anthology of Sublime Love'' (Paris, 1956), further identified "sublime love", a state of realized idealisation perhaps equatable with the romantic form of passionate love.&lt;/ref&gt; However, with Greek (as with many other languages), it has been historically difficult to separate the meanings of these words totally. At the same time, the Ancient Greek text of the [[Bible]] has examples of the [[verb]] ''agapo'' having the same meaning as ''[[phileo]]''.

''[[Agapē|Agape]]'' ({{lang|grc|ἀγάπη}} ''agápē'') means ''love'' in modern-day Greek. The term ''s'agapo'' means ''I love you'' in Greek. The word ''agapo'' is the verb ''I love''. It generally refers to a "pure," [[ideal type]] of love, rather than the physical attraction suggested by ''eros''. However, there are some examples of ''agape'' used to mean the same as ''eros''. It has also been translated as "love of the soul."&lt;ref name="Anders Theodor Samuel Nygren 1936"&gt;Anders Theodor Samuel Nygren, ''[[Eros and Agape]]'' (first published in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], 1930-1936).&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Eros (love)|Eros]]'' ({{lang|grc|ἔρως}} ''érōs'') (from the Greek deity [[Eros]]) is passionate love, with sensual desire and longing. The Greek word ''erota'' means ''in love''. [[Plato]] refined his own definition. Although eros is initially felt for a person, with contemplation it becomes an appreciation of the beauty within that person, or even becomes appreciation of beauty itself. Eros helps the soul recall knowledge of beauty and contributes to an understanding of spiritual truth. Lovers and philosophers are all inspired to seek truth by eros. Some translations list it as "love of the body".&lt;ref name="Anders Theodor Samuel Nygren 1936"/&gt;

''[[Philia]]'' ({{lang|grc|φιλία}} ''philía''), a dispassionate virtuous love, was a concept addressed and developed by [[Aristotle]] in his [[Nicomachean Ethics]] Book VIII.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/love/|title=Philosophy of Love {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes loyalty to friends, family, and community, and requires virtue, equality, and familiarity. Philia is motivated by practical reasons; one or both of the parties benefit from the relationship. It can also mean "love of the mind."

''[[Storge]]'' ({{lang|grc|στοργή}} ''storgē'') is natural affection, like that felt by parents for offspring.

''[[Xenia (Greek)|Xenia]]'' (ξενία ''xenía''), hospitality, was an extremely important practice in [[ancient Greece]]. It was an almost ritualized friendship formed between a host and his guest, who could previously have been strangers. The host fed and provided quarters for the guest, who was expected to repay only with gratitude. The importance of this can be seen throughout [[Greek mythology]]—in particular, [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]''.

===Ancient Roman (Latin)===
The [[Latin|Latin language]] has several different verbs corresponding to the English word "love." ''[[wikt:amo#Latin|amō]]'' is the basic verb meaning ''I love'', with the infinitive ''[[wikt:amare#Italian|amare]]'' (“to love”) as it still is in [[Italian language|Italian]] today. The Romans used it both in an affectionate sense as well as in a romantic or sexual sense. From this verb come ''amans''—a lover, amator, "professional lover," often with the accessory notion of lechery—and ''amica'', "girlfriend" in the English sense, often being applied euphemistically to a prostitute. The corresponding noun is ''amor'' (the significance of this term for the Romans is well illustrated in the fact, that the name of the City, [[Rome]]—in Latin: ''Roma''—can be viewed as an [[anagram]] for ''amor'', which was used as the secret name of the City in wide circles in ancient times),&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Köves-Zulauf, Reden und Schweigen, Munich, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; which is also used in the plural form to indicate love affairs or sexual adventures. This same root also produces ''amicus''—"friend"—and ''amicitia'', "friendship" (often based to mutual advantage, and corresponding sometimes more closely to "indebtedness" or "influence"). Cicero wrote a treatise called ''On Friendship'' (''de Amicitia''), which discusses the notion at some length. Ovid wrote a guide to dating called ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'' (''The Art of Love''), which addresses, in depth, everything from [[Affair|extramarital affairs]] to overprotective parents.

Latin sometimes uses ''amāre'' where English would simply say ''to like''. This notion, however, is much more generally expressed in Latin by the terms ''placere'' or ''delectāre'', which are used more colloquially, the latter used frequently in the love poetry of [[Catullus]]. ''Diligere'' often has the notion "to be affectionate for," "to esteem," and rarely if ever is used for romantic love. This word would be appropriate to describe the friendship of two men. The corresponding noun ''diligentia'', however, has the meaning of "diligence" or "carefulness," and has little semantic overlap with the verb. ''Observare'' is a synonym for ''diligere''; despite the cognate with English, this verb and its corresponding noun, ''observantia'', often denote "esteem" or "affection." ''[[Charity (virtue)|Caritas]]'' is used in Latin translations of the Christian Bible to mean "charitable love"; this meaning, however, is not found in Classical pagan [[Latin literature|Roman literature]]. As it arises from a [[conflation]] with a Greek word, there is no corresponding verb.

===Chinese and other Sinic cultures===
[[File:Love-zh.svg|thumb|upright|{{lang|zh|愛}} (Mandarin: ''ài''), the traditional [[Chinese character]] for love contains a [[heart]] ({{lang|zh|心}}) in the middle.]]

Two philosophical underpinnings of love exist in the Chinese tradition, one from [[Confucianism]] which emphasized actions and duty while the other came from [[Mohism]] which championed a universal love.  A core concept to Confucianism is {{lang|zh|{{linktext|仁}}}} (''[[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]]'', "benevolent love"), which focuses on duty, action and attitude in a relationship rather than love itself.  In Confucianism, one displays benevolent love by performing actions such as [[filial piety]] from children, kindness from parent, loyalty to the king and so forth.

The concept of {{lang|zh|愛}} (Mandarin: ''ài'') was developed by the Chinese philosopher [[Mozi]] in the 4th century BC in reaction to Confucianism's benevolent love.  Mozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese over-attachment to family and clan structures with the concept of "universal love" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|兼愛}}}}, ''jiān'ài''). In this, he argued directly against Confucians who believed that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, by contrast, believed people in principle should care for all people equally.  Mohism stressed that rather than adopting different attitudes towards different people, love should be unconditional and offered to everyone without regard to reciprocation, not just to friends, family and other Confucian relations.  Later in [[Chinese Buddhism]], the term ''Ai'' ({{lang|zh|愛}}) was adopted to refer to a passionate caring love and was considered a fundamental desire. In Buddhism, ''Ai'' was seen as capable of being either selfish or selfless, the latter being a key element towards enlightenment.

In [[Mandarin Chinese]], {{lang|zh|{{linktext|愛}}}} (''ài'') is often used as the equivalent of the Western concept of love. {{lang|zh|{{linktext|愛}}}} (''ài'') is used as both a verb (e.g. {{lang|zh|我愛你}}, ''Wǒ ài nǐ'' , or "I love you") and a noun (such as {{lang|zh|{{linktext|愛情}}}} ''àiqíng'', or "romantic love"). However, due to the influence of Confucian {{lang|zh|{{linktext|仁}}}} (''rén''), the phrase {{lang|zh|我愛你}} (''Wǒ ài nǐ'', I love you) carries with it a very specific sense of responsibility, commitment and loyalty. Instead of frequently saying "I love you" as in some Western societies, the Chinese are more likely to express feelings of affection in a more casual way. Consequently, "I like you" ({{lang|zh|我喜欢你}}, ''Wǒ xǐhuan nǐ'') is a more common way of expressing affection in Chinese; it is more playful and less serious.&lt;ref&gt;JFK Miller, "[http://shanghai.urbanatomy.com/index.php/i-ahearts-shanghai/85-i-love-shanghai/429-why-the-chinese-dont-say-qi-love-youq Why the Chinese Don't Say I Love You] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124202633/http://shanghai.urbanatomy.com/index.php/i-ahearts-shanghai/85-i-love-shanghai/429-why-the-chinese-dont-say-qi-love-youq |date=24 January 2010 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true in Japanese (''suki da'', {{lang|ja|好きだ}}).

The [[Japanese language]] uses three words to convey the English equivalent of "love".  Because "love" covers a wide range of emotions and behavioral phenomena, there are nuances distinguishing the three terms.&lt;ref name="Ryang2006"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ryang | first1 = Sonia | title = Love in Modern Japan: Its Estrangement from Self, Sex and Society | year = 2006 | publisher = Routledge | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tkOUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13 | pages = 13–14| isbn = 9781135988630 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Abe | first1 = Namiko | url = http://japanese.about.com/od/japanesecultur1/a/The-Japanese-Words-For-Love.htm | title = Japanese Words for "Love": The Difference between "Ai" and "Koi" | publisher = About.com | accessdate = 5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term {{Nihongo|''ai''|愛}}, which is often associated with maternal love&lt;ref name="Ryang2006"/&gt; or selfless love,&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; originally referred to beauty and was often used in religious context.  Following the [[Meiji Restoration]] 1868, the term became associated with "love" in order to translate Western literature.  Prior to Western influence, the term {{Nihongo|''koi''|恋}} generally represented romantic love, and was often the subject of the popular [[Man'yōshū]] Japanese poetry collection.&lt;ref name="Ryang2006"/&gt;  ''Koi'' describes a longing for a member of the opposite sex and is typical interpreted as selfish and wanting.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;  The term's origins come from the concept of lonely solitude as a result of separation from a loved one.  Though modern usage of ''koi'' focuses on sexual love and infatuation, the Manyō used the term to cover a wider range of situations, including tenderness, benevolence, and material desire.&lt;ref name="Ryang2006"/&gt;  The third term, {{Nihongo|''ren'ai''|恋愛}}, is a more modern construction that combines the [[kanji]] characters for both ''ai'' and ''koi'', though its usage more closely resembles that of ''koi'' in the form of romantic love.&lt;ref name="Ryang2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

The concept kama is found in some of the earliest known verses in [[Veda]]s. For example, Book 10 of Rig Veda describes the creation of the universe from nothing by the great heat. There in hymn 129, it states:
{{Quote|

===Abrahamic religions===
[[File:Ahava.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Indiana]]'s 1977 [[Love (sculpture)|''Love'' sculpture]] spelling ''ahava''.]]

====Christianity====
The Christian understanding is that love comes from God. The love of man and woman—''eros'' in Greek—and the unselfish love of others (''agape''), are often contrasted as "descending" and "ascending" love, respectively, but are ultimately the same thing.&lt;ref name="vatican1"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20051225_deus-caritas-est_en.html
|author=Pope Benedict XVI
|title=papal encyclical, Deus Caritas Est}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several Greek words for "love" that are regularly referred to in Christian circles.
* ''[[Agape]]'': In the [[New Testament]], ''agapē'' is charitable, selfless, altruistic, and unconditional. It is parental love, seen as creating goodness in the world; it is the way [[God]] is seen to love humanity, and it is seen as the kind of love that Christians aspire to have for one another.&lt;ref name="Anders Theodor Samuel Nygren 1936"/&gt;
* ''[[Phileo]]'': Also used in the New Testament, ''phileo'' is a human response to something that is found to be delightful. Also known as "brotherly love."
* Two other [[#Ancient Greek|words for love in the Greek language]], ''[[Eros (love)|eros]]'' (sexual love) and ''[[storge]]'' (child-to-parent love), were never used in the New Testament.&lt;ref name="Anders Theodor Samuel Nygren 1936"/&gt;

[[Christianity|Christians]] believe that to ''Love God with all your heart, mind, and strength'' and ''Love your [[neighbourhood|neighbor]] as yourself'' are the two most important things in life (the [[Great Commandment|greatest commandment]] of the Jewish [[Torah]], according to [[Jesus]]; cf. [[Gospel of Mark]] chapter 12, verses 28–34). [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] summarized this when he wrote "Love God, and do as thou wilt."

[[File:baglione.jpg|thumb|upright|''Sacred and Profane Love'' (1602–03) by [[Giovanni Baglione]]. Intended as an attack on his hated enemy the artist [[Caravaggio]], it shows a boy (hinting at Caravaggio's homosexuality) on one side, a devil with Caravaggio's face on the other, and between an angel representing pure, meaning non-erotic, love.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wga.hu/html_m/b/baglione/sacred2.html Description of Sacred and Profane Love&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[The Apostle Paul]] glorified love as the most important virtue of all. Describing love in the famous poetic interpretation in [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]], he wrote, "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, and always perseveres." ([[1 Corinthians|1 Cor.]] 13:4–7, [[NIV]])

[[John the Apostle|The Apostle John]] wrote, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him." ([[Gospel of John|John]] 3:16–17, NIV) John also wrote, "Dear friends, let us love one another for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love." ([[1 John]] 4:7–8, NIV)

[[Saint Augustine]] says that one must be able to decipher the difference between love and lust. Lust, according to Saint Augustine, is an overindulgence, but to love and be loved is what he has sought for his entire life. He even says, “I was in love with love.” Finally, he does fall in love and is loved back, by God. Saint Augustine says the only one who can love you truly and fully is God, because love with a human only allows for flaws such as "jealousy, suspicion, fear, anger, and contention." According to Saint Augustine, to love God is "to attain the peace which is yours." (Saint Augustine's ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'')

Augustine regards the duplex commandment of love in Matthew 22 as the heart of Christian faith and the interpretation of the Bible. After the review of Christian doctrine, Augustine treats the problem of love in terms of use and enjoyment until the end of Book I of ''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'' (1.22.21-1.40.44;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B. Hoon | title=Augustine's Hermeneutics and Homiletics in ''De doctrina christiana'' | journal= Journal of Christian Philosophy | year=2013 | volume=17 | url=https://www.academia.edu/5228314 |pages=97–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian [[Theology|theologians]] see God as the source of love, which is mirrored in humans and their own loving relationships. Influential Christian theologian [[C.S. Lewis]] wrote a book called ''[[The Four Loves]]''. [[Benedict XVI]] named his first [[encyclical]] ''[[Deus caritas est|God is love]]''. He said that a human being, created in the image of God, who is love, is able to practice love; to give himself to God and others ([[agape]]) and by receiving and experiencing God's love in contemplation (eros). This life of love, according to him, is the life of the saints such as [[Mother Teresa|Teresa of Calcutta]] and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] and is the direction Christians take when they believe that God loves them.&lt;ref name="vatican1"/&gt;

[[Pope Francis]] taught that "True love is both loving and letting oneself be loved..what is important in love is not our loving, but allowing ourselves to be loved by God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2015/january/documents/papa-francesco_20150118_srilanka-filippine-incontro-giovani.html|title=Sri Lanka - Philippines: Meeting with the young people in the sports field of Santo Tomas University (Manila, 18 January 2015) - Francis|website=w2.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; And so, in the analysis of a Catholic theologian, for Pope Francis, "the key to love...is not our activity. It is the activity of the greatest, and the source, of all the powers in the universe: God’s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/82535/the-key-to-love-according-to-pope-francis|title=The key to love according to Pope Francis|first=Raul|last=Nidoy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christianity the practical definition of love is summarised by [[St. Thomas Aquinas]], who defined love as "to will the good of another," or to desire for another to succeed.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt; This is an explanation of the Christian need to love others, including their enemies. As Thomas Aquinas explains, Christian love is motivated by the need to see others succeed in life, to be good people.

Regarding love for enemies, Jesus is quoted in the Gospel of Matthew chapter five:

"You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’  But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven.  He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.  If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?  Are not even the tax collectors doing that?  And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others?  Do not even pagans do that?  Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect."
- Matthew 5: 43-48''

Tertullian wrote regarding love for enemies: "Our individual, extraordinary, and perfect goodness consists in loving our enemies.  To love one's friends is common practice, to love one's enemies only among Christians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Swartley | first=Willard M. | title=The Love of Enemy and Nonretaliation in the New Testament, Studies in peace and scripture; (As Scapulam I) cited by Hans Haas, Idee und Ideal de Feindesliebe in der ausserchristlichen Welt (Leipzig: University of Leipzig, 1927) | publisher= Westminster John Knox Press | year= 1992 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=qjbYqFHzg_EC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=Our+individual,+extraordinary,+and+perfect+goodness#v=onepage&amp;q=Our%20individual%2C%20extraordinary%2C%20and%20perfect%20goodness&amp;f=false |page=24 | isbn=9780664253547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
{{see also|Jewish views on love}}
In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], {{lang|he|אהבה}} (''ahava'') is the most commonly used term for both interpersonal love and love between God and God's creations. [[Chesed]], often translated as loving-kindness, is used to describe many forms of love between human beings.

The commandment to love other people is given in the [[Torah]], which states, "Love your neighbor like yourself" ([[Leviticus]] 19:18). The Torah's commandment to love [[God]] "with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your might" ([[Deuteronomy]] 6:5) is taken by the [[Mishnah]] (a central text of the Jewish [[oral law]]) to refer to good deeds, willingness to sacrifice one's life rather than commit certain serious transgressions, willingness to sacrifice all of one's possessions, and being grateful to the Lord despite adversity (tractate Berachoth 9:5). [[Rabbinic literature]] differs as to how this love can be developed, e.g., by contemplating divine deeds or witnessing the marvels of nature. As for love between marital partners, this is deemed an essential ingredient to life: "See life with the wife you love" ([[Ecclesiastes]] 9:9). The biblical book [[Song of Solomon]] is considered a romantically phrased metaphor of love between [[God]] and his people, but in its plain reading, reads like a love song.  The 20th-century [[Rabbi]] [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]] is frequently quoted as defining love from the Jewish point of view as "giving without expecting to take" (from his ''Michtav me-Eliyahu'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;1).

====Islam====
Love encompasses the Islamic view of life as universal brotherhood that applies to all who hold faith. Amongst the 99 names of God ([[Allah]]), there is the name ''Al-Wadud'', or "the Loving One," which is found in Surah {{Quran-usc|11|90|q=}} as well as Surah {{Quran-usc|85|14|q=}}. God is also referenced at the beginning of every chapter in the Qur'an as ''Ar-Rahman'' and ''Ar-Rahim'', or the "Most Compassionate" and the "Most Merciful", indicating that nobody is more loving, compassionate and benevolent than God. The Qur'an refers to God as being "full of loving kindness."

The Qur'an exhorts Muslim believers to treat all people, those who have not persecuted them, with ''birr'' or "deep kindness" as stated in Surah {{Quran-usc|6|8-9|q=}}. ''Birr'' is also used by the Qur'an in describing the love and kindness that children must show to their parents.

''[[Ishq]]'', or divine love, is the emphasis of [[Sufism]] in the Islamic tradition. Practitioners of Sufism believe that love is a projection of the essence of God to the universe. God desires to recognize beauty, and as if one looks at a mirror to see oneself, God "looks" at himself within the dynamics of nature. Since everything is a reflection of God, the school of Sufism practices to see the beauty inside the apparently ugly. Sufism is often referred to as the religion of love.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} God in Sufism is referred to in three main terms, which are the Lover, Loved, and Beloved, with the last of these terms being often seen in Sufi poetry. A common viewpoint of Sufism is that through love, humankind can get back to its inherent purity and grace. The saints of Sufism are infamous for being "drunk" due to their [[love of God]]; hence, the constant reference to wine in Sufi poetry and music.

====Bahá'í Faith====
In his [[Paris Talks]], [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] described four types of love: the love that flows from God to human beings; the love that flows from human beings to God; the love of God towards the Self or Identity of God; and the love of human beings for human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PT/pt-59.html|title=Bahá'í Reference Library - Paris Talks, Pages 179-181|website=reference.bahai.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian religions===
====Buddhism====
In [[Buddhism]], ''[[Kāma]]'' is sensuous, sexual love. It is an obstacle on the path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], since it is selfish. ''[[Karuṇā]]'' is compassion and mercy, which reduces the suffering of others. It is complementary to wisdom and is necessary for enlightenment. ''Adveṣa'' and ''[[mettā]]'' are benevolent love. This love is unconditional and requires considerable self-acceptance. This is quite different from ordinary love, which is usually about attachment and sex and which rarely occurs without self-interest. Instead, in Buddhism it refers to detachment and unselfish interest in others' welfare.

The [[Bodhisattva]] ideal in Mahayana Buddhism involves the complete renunciation of oneself in order to take on the burden of a suffering world. The strongest motivation one has in order to take the path of the Bodhisattva is the idea of salvation within unselfish, altruistic love for all sentient beings.

====Hinduism====

[[File:Kama Rati.jpg|thumb|upright|Kama (left) with Rati on a temple wall of [[Chennakesava Temple]], [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]]]]
In [[Hinduism]], ''[[kāma]]'' is pleasurable, sexual love, personified by the god [[Kamadeva]]. For many Hindu schools, it is the third end (''[[Kama#Kama in Hinduism|Kama]]'') in life. Kamadeva is often pictured holding a bow of [[sugar cane]] and an arrow of flowers; he may ride upon a great parrot. He is usually accompanied by his consort [[Rati]] and his companion Vasanta, lord of the spring season. Stone images of Kamadeva and Rati can be seen on the door of the Chennakeshava temple at Belur, in [[Karnataka]], [[India]]. ''Maara'' is another name for ''kāma''.

In contrast to ''kāma'', ''prema''{{spaced ndash}}or ''prem''{{spaced ndash}}refers to elevated love. ''[[Karuṇā|Karuna]]'' is compassion and mercy, which impels one to help reduce the suffering of others. ''Bhakti'' is a [[Sanskrit]] term, meaning "loving devotion to the supreme God." A person who practices ''bhakti'' is called a ''bhakta''. Hindu writers, theologians, and philosophers have distinguished nine forms of ''[[bhakti]]'', which can be found in the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' and works by [[Tulsidas]]. The philosophical work ''[[Narada Bhakti Sutra]]s'', written by an unknown author (presumed to be [[Narada]]), distinguishes eleven forms of love.

In certain Vaishnava sects within Hinduism, attaining unadulterated, unconditional and incessant love for Godhead is considered the foremost goal of life. Gaudiya Vaishnavas who worship Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the cause of all causes consider Love for Godhead (Prema) to act in two ways: sambhoga and vipralambha (union and separation)—two opposites .&lt;ref name="Krishna Prema"&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150168632408280|author=Gour Govinda Swami|title=Wonderful Characteristic of Krishna Prema, Gour Govinda Swami}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the condition of separation, there is an acute yearning for being with the beloved and in the condition of union there is supreme happiness and nectarean. Gaudiya Vaishnavas consider that Krishna-prema (Love for Godhead) is not fire but that it still burns away one's material desires. They consider that Kṛṣṇa-prema is not a weapon, but it still pierces the heart. It is not water, but it washes away everything—one's pride, religious rules, and one's shyness. Krishna-prema is considered to make one drown in the ocean of transcendental ecstasy and pleasure. The love of Radha, a cowherd girl, for Krishna is often cited as the supreme example of love for Godhead by Gaudiya Vaishnavas. Radha is considered to be the internal potency of Krishna, and is the supreme lover of Godhead. Her example of love is considered to be beyond the understanding of material realm as it surpasses any form of selfish love or lust that is visible in the material world. The reciprocal love between Radha (the supreme lover) and Krishna (God as the Supremely Loved) is the subject of many poetic compositions in India such as the ''[[Gita Govinda]]'' and ''Hari Bhakti Shuddhodhaya.''

In the Bhakti tradition within Hinduism, it is believed that execution of devotional service to God leads to the development of Love for God ''(taiche bhakti-phale krsne prema upajaya)'', and as love for God increases in the heart, the more one becomes free from material contamination ''(krishna-prema asvada haile, bhava nasa paya)''.  Being perfectly in love with God or Krishna makes one perfectly free from material contamination. and this is the ultimate way of salvation or liberation. In this tradition, salvation or liberation is considered inferior to love, and just an incidental by-product. Being absorbed in Love for God is considered to be the perfection of life.&lt;ref name="Perfect Love"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prabhupadanugas.eu/?p=23368 |author=A C Bhaktivedanta Swami|title=Being Perfectly in Love}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free love===
{{Main|Free love}}
The term "free love" has been used&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.syr.edu/digital/collections/h/Hand-bookOfTheOneidaCommunity/ The Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613152552/http://library.syr.edu/digital/collections/h/Hand-bookOfTheOneidaCommunity/ |date=13 June 2010 }} of the [[Oneida Community]] claims to have coined the term around 1850, and laments that its use was appropriated by [[socialist]]s to attack marriage, an institution that they felt protected women and children from abandonment&lt;/ref&gt; to describe a [[social movement]] that rejects [[marriage]], which is seen as a form of social bondage. The Free Love movement's initial goal was to separate the state from sexual matters such as marriage, [[birth control]], and [[adultery]]. It claimed that such issues were the concern of the people involved, and no one else.&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Wendy. "The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism." ''Libertarian Enterprise'' .19 (1996): 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people in the early 19th century believed that marriage was an important aspect of life to "fulfill earthly human happiness." Middle-class Americans wanted the home to be a place of stability in an uncertain world. This mentality created a vision of strongly defined gender roles, which provoked the advancement of the free love movement as a contrast.&lt;ref name="Spurlock, John C 1988"&gt;Spurlock, John C. ''Free Love Marriage and Middle-Class Radicalism in America''. New York, NY: New York UP, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "sex radical" has been used interchangeably with the term "free lover".{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} By whatever name, advocates had two strong beliefs: opposition to the idea of forceful sexual activity in a relationship and advocacy for a woman to use her body in any way that she pleases.&lt;ref name="Passet, Joanne E 2003"&gt;Passet, Joanne E. ''Sex Radicals and the Quest for Women's Equality''. Chicago, IL: U of Illinois P, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; These are also beliefs of [[Feminism]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Citation | title= Love's Lessons: Intimacy, Pedagogy and Political Community| first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Hannah | last2= Stark | journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities | volume= 22 | issue= 4 | pages= 69–79 | year= 2017 | url = https://www.academia.edu/35349930 | doi=10.1080/0969725x.2017.1406048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical views==
{{Main|Philosophy of love}}
[[File:Where is the love.jpg|thumb|[[Graffiti]] in [[East Timor]]]]

The philosophy of love is a field of [[social philosophy]] and [[ethics]] that attempts to [[explanation|explain]] the nature of love.&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard. ''Works of Love.''&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophical investigation of love includes the tasks of distinguishing between the various kinds of personal love, asking if and how love is or can be justified, asking what the [[value (ethics)|value]] of love is, and what impact love has on the [[autonomy]] of both the lover and the beloved.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Many different theories attempt to [[explanation|explain]] the nature and function of love. Explaining love to a hypothetical person who had not himself or herself experienced love or being loved would be very difficult because to such a person love would appear to be quite strange if not outright irrational behavior. Among the prevailing types of theories that attempt to account for the existence of love are: [[psychology|psychological]] theories, the vast majority of which consider love to be very healthy behavior; [[Evolutionary theory|evolutionary theories]] which hold that love is part of the process of [[natural selection]]; [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritual theories]] which may, for instance consider love to be a gift from a god; and theories that consider love to be an unexplainable mystery, very much like a [[mysticism|mystical experience]].

(1980) Translated by H. William Tjalsma.  New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt; who taught a form of modified [[Spinoza|Spinozism]].&lt;ref&gt;see Enlightenment Contested : Philosophy, Modernity, and the Emancipation of Man by [[Jonathan I. Israel]], p50. Oxford 2006&lt;/ref&gt; During his lifetime he published very little, but corresponded with most of the leaders of the [[French Enlightenment]]. Rediscovered in 1862, he was hailed as a precursor of [[Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;"Beaussire, who published le centenaire de Hegel en 1870 (1871) saw Hegel as continuing the views of Dom ,,Deschamps" (The Bloomsbury Companion to Hegel, p322)&lt;/ref&gt; His [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] system anticipates [[Hegel]] by asserting that truth includes contradictory elements, and he had much to say about how the concept Being collapses into that of Nothing.&lt;ref&gt;""Everything is nothing." "No doubt no one before me has ever written that everything and nothing are one and the same." For Deschamps, this principle is basic to his doctrine on existence: "What is the cause of existence? Answer: Its cause resides in the fact that nothing is something, in that it is existence, in that it is everything." Here he finds a place for God as well: "God is nothing, nonexistence itself."" (Shafarevich, p116)&lt;/ref&gt; There was a further revival of interest in his work after 1974, and his collected works were finally published in 1993.

'''Magic Lantern''' is a [[firmware]] [[Upgrade|add-on]] for various Canon [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras]] and the [[Canon EOS M|EOS M]].&lt;ref name="cnet-ssavvides"&gt;"[https://www.cnet.com/uk/how-to/how-to-unlock-more-features-on-your-canon-dslr/ Unlock hidden features on your Canon dSLR]". Lexy Savvides, [[CNET]], 12 December 2014. Accessed 31 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It adds features for [[Digital movie camera|DSLR filmmaking]] and still [[photography]], and is [[free and open-source software|free and open-source]].

Magic Lantern was originally written for the [[Canon EOS 5D Mark II]]&lt;ref name="lifehacker-dachis"&gt;"[http://lifehacker.com/5729101/transform-your-dslr-into-a-supercharged-professional-video-camera Transform Your DSLR into a Supercharged, Professional Video Camera]". Adam Dachis, [[Lifehacker]], 1/10/2011. Accessed 31 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; by Trammell Hudson in 2009 after he reverse engineered its firmware.&lt;ref name="hudson-ml" /&gt; He ported it to the [[Canon EOS 550D]] in July 2010. There are now versions for many other Canon DSLRs and the current principal developer is known as A1ex.

Because installing Magic Lantern does not replace the stock Canon firmware or modify the ROM but rather runs alongside it,&lt;ref name="lifehacker-dachis" /&gt; it is both easy to remove and carries little risk.&lt;ref name="30c3" /&gt; The camera checks a "[[Booting|boot]] [[Bit field|flag]]" in its re-writable memory, and if set, reads from a [[memory card]] to get the additional firmware routines. Each time the camera is started, there is an option to disable Magic Lantern.

==History==

Charlie Sorrel, [[Wired (magazine)]], 24 June 2009. Accessed 31 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; by Trammell Hudson in 2009 after he reverse engineered its firmware.&lt;ref name="hudson-ml" /&gt; He ported it to the [[Canon EOS 550D]]&lt;ref name="gizmag"&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/magic-lantern-canon-eos-7d-cracked/24189/ Magic Lantern team finally cracks the Canon EOS 7D]. Gizmag. Accessed 31 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; in July 2010.

Starting in September 2010, a person using the name "A1ex" on the [[CHDK]] (Canon Hack Development Kit) website forum and other people ported Magic Lantern to the [[Canon EOS 50D]],&lt;ref name="cnet-ssavvides" /&gt; [[Canon EOS 60D|60D]],&lt;ref name="cnet-ssavvides" /&gt;&lt;ref name="theverge-sottek"&gt;"[https://www.theverge.com/2011/12/21/2651863/magic-lantern-HDR-firmware-Canon-DSLR-video Magic Lantern firmware adds HDR video to Canon DSLRs]".

The '''May 19th Communist Organization''' (also variously referred to as the '''May 19 Coalition''', '''May 19 Communist Coalition''', and various alternatives of '''M19CO'''), was a US-based, self-described revolutionary organization formed by members of the [[Weather Underground Organization]]. The group was originally known as the [[New York City|New York]] chapter of the [[Prairie Fire Organizing Committee]] (PFOC), an organization devoted to legally promoting the causes of the Weather Underground. This was part of the Prairie Fire Manifesto's change in Weather Underground Organization strategy, which demanded both aboveground mass and clandestine organizations. The role of the clandestine organization would be to build the  "consciousness of action" and prepare the way for the development of a people's militia.  Concurrently, the role of the mass movement (i.e., above ground Prairie Fire Collective) would include support for, and encouragement of, armed action. Such an alliance would, according to Weather, "help create the 'sea' for the guerrillas to swim in."&lt;ref&gt;

==Objectives==
This alliance between the Weather Underground and the Black Liberation Army had three objectives:
* Free political prisoners in US prisons
* Appropriate capitalist wealth (armed robberies) to fund the third stage, and
* Initiate a series of bombings and terrorist attacks&lt;ref name="Seger"/&gt;

==Activities==
From 1982 to 1985 M19CO committed a series of bombings, including bombings of the [[National War College]], the [[Washington Navy Yard]] Computing Center, the [[Israeli Aircraft Industries]] Building, New York City's [[South Africa]]n consulate, the Washington Navy Yard Officers' Club, New York City's Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, and the [[United States Capitol Building]]. Three officers were killed during the Brinks Robbery, but no one was injured or killed in their bombings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= U.S. Charges 7 In the Bombing At U.S. Capitol

Almost all the M19CO members were convicted in a US Court of Law for these offenses, but [[Elizabeth Ann Duke]] remains at large.

*In 1979 three members walked into the visitor’s center at the [[Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women|Clinton Correctional Facility for Women]] near [[Clinton, New Jersey|Clinton]], took two guards hostage, and freed [[Assata Shakur]], a member of the Black Liberation Army. Shakur was serving a sentence of life plus 26 to 33 years for the murder of a state trooper.&lt;ref name="Seger"/&gt;

*Several months later they arranged for the escape of [[William Morales]], a member of the Puerto Rican separatist group, the [[Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional Puertorriqueña]] (FALN), from [[Bellevue Hospital]] in New York City where he was recovering after a bomb he was building exploded in his hands.&lt;ref name="Seger"/&gt;

*In 1981 Weather Underground members [[Kathy Boudin]], [[Judith Alice Clark]], and [[David Gilbert (activist)|David Gilbert]], together with several members of the Black Liberation Army, participated in the [[Brinks robbery (1981)|robbery of a Brinks armored car]] at the Nanuet Mall, near [[Nyack, New York]], during which a Brinks guard and two Nyack police officers were killed.  Upon her arrest Boudin was identified as a member of the May 19 Communist Organization.
*On January 28, 1983, M19CO bombed the federal building on Staten Island, N.Y.
*On April 25, 1983, the group was responsible for a bombing at the National War College at [[Fort McNair]] in Washington, D.C.
*On November 7, 1983, the group [[1983 United States Senate bombing|triggered a bomb explosion at the US Senate]].
*On August 18, 1983, it bombed the Washington Navy Yard Computer Center.
*On April 5, 1984, it bombed the Israeli Aircraft Industries Building.
*On April 20, 1984, M19CO committed a bombing at the Washington Navy Yard Officers Club.
*On November 3, 1984, two members of the M19CO, [[Susan Rosenberg]] and Timothy Blunk, were arrested at a mini-warehouse they had rented in [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey]]. Police recovered more than 100 blasting caps, nearly 200 sticks of dynamite, more than 100 cartridges of gel explosive, and 24 bags of blasting agent from the warehouse.
*On September 26, 1984, the South African consulate was bombed.
*The M19CO alliance's last bombing was on February 23, 1985, at the Policemen's Benevolent Association in New York City.

==Arrests==
By May 23, 1985, all members of the group had been arrested, with the exception of Elizabeth Duke, who remains a fugitive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/dt/elizabeth-anna-duke]&lt;/ref&gt; Alleged rioter Donna Joan Borup was arrested but failed to appear at trial and is currently on the FBI Most Wanted Terrorist list.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/dt/donna-joan-borup]&lt;/ref&gt;

In spirituality, '''nondualism''', also called '''non-duality''', means "not two" or "one undivided without a second".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John A. Grimes |title=A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcoUFYOX0bEC |date=1996 |publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-7914-3067-5 |pages=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Katz|2007}} Nondualism primarily refers to a mature state of consciousness, in which the dichotomy of I-other is "transcended", and awareness is described as "centerless" and "without dichotomies".&lt;ref group=web name"JF"&gt;[http://www.lifewithoutacentre.com/writings/what-is-nonduality/ ''What is Non-Duality?'']&lt;/ref&gt; Although this state of consciousness may seem to appear spontaneous,{{refn|group=note|See ''Cosmic Consciousness'', by Richard Bucke}} it usually follows prolonged preparation through ascetic or meditative/contemplative practice, which includes ethical injunctions. While the term "nondualism" is derived from [[Advaita Vedanta]], descriptions of nondual consciousness can be found within [[Hinduism]] ([[Turiya]], [[sahaja]]), [[Buddhism]] ([[Buddha-nature]], [[rigpa]], [[shentong]]), and western [[Christian]] and [[Neoplatonism|neo-Platonic traditions]] ([[henosis]], [[Mysticism|mystical union]]).

The Asian idea of nondualism developed in the [[Vedic]] and post-Vedic [[Hindu]] philosophies, as well as in the [[Buddhist]] traditions.{{sfn|Dasgupta|Mohanta|1998|p=362}} The oldest traces of nondualism in Indian thought are found as ''Advaita'' in the earlier [[Hindu]] [[Upanishad]]s such as [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], as well as other pre-Buddhist Upanishads such as the [[Chandogya Upanishad]], which emphasizes the unity of individual soul called [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and the Supreme called [[Brahman]]. In Hinduism, nondualism has more commonly become associated with the Advaita Vedanta tradition of [[Adi Shankara]].{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}}

The Buddhist tradition added the teachings of [[śūnyatā]]; the [[two truths doctrine]], the nonduality of the absolute and the relative truth,{{sfn|Loy|1988|p=9-11}}{{sfn|Davis|2010}} and the [[Yogachara]] notion of "mind/thought only" (''citta-matra'') or "representation-only" (''[[Yogacara#Representation-only|vijñaptimātra]]'').{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}} ''Vijñapti-mātra'' and the two truths doctrine, coupled with the concept of [[Buddha-nature]], have also been influential concepts in the subsequent development of Mahayana Buddhism, not only in India, but also in China and Tibet, most notably the Chán (Zen) and Dzogchen traditions.

Western [[Neo-Platonism]] is an essential element of both [[Christian contemplation]] and [[mysticism]], and of [[Western esotericism]] and [[Spirituality#Modern spirituality|modern spirituality]], especially [[Unitarianism]], [[Transcendentalism]], [[Universalism]] and [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]].

==Etymology==
''Advaita'' of Hinduism and ''Advaya'' of Buddhism both refer to nondualism.

"Advaita" (अद्वैत) is from Sanskrit roots ''a'', not; ''dvaita'', dual, and is usually translated as "nondualism", "nonduality" and "nondual". The term "nondualism" and the term "''advaita''" from which it originates are [[Polyvalent logic|polyvalent]] terms. The English word's origin is the [[Latin]] ''duo'' meaning "two" prefixed with "non-" meaning "not".

"Advaya" (अद्वय) is also a Sanskrit word that means "identity, unique, not two, without a second," and typically refers to the two truths doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism, especially Madhyamaka.

One of the earliest uses of the word Advaita is found in verse 4.3.32 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (~800 BCE), and in verses 7 and 12 of the [[Mandukya Upanishad]] (variously dated to have been composed between 500 BCE to 200 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Adolphus Jacob|title=A concordance to the principal Upanisads and Bhagavadgita|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tx-oj1dlojEC|year=1999|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1281-9|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term appears in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad in the section with a discourse of the oneness of Atman and Brahman, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n147/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad] Robert Hume (Translator), Oxford University Press, pp. 127–147&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|An ocean is that one seer, without any duality [Advaita]; this is the Brahma-world, O King. Thus did [[Yajnavalkya]] teach him. This is his highest goal, this is his highest success, this is his highest world, this is his highest bliss. All other creatures live on a small portion of that bliss.|''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'' 4.3.32 |&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/details/SacredBooksEastVariousOrientalScholarsWithIndex.50VolsMaxMuller Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad] The Sacred Books of the East, Volume 15, Oxford University Press, page 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n159/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad] Robert Hume (Translator), Oxford University Press, page 138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen (1997), Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814677}}, page 491; Sanskrit: ससलिले एकस् द्रष्टा '''अद्वैत'''स् भवति एष ब्रह्मलोकः (...)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The English term "nondual" was also informed by early translations of the Upanishads in Western languages other than English from 1775. These terms have entered the English language from literal English renderings of "[[Advaita Vedanta|advaita]]" subsequent to the first wave of English translations of the [[Upanishads]]. These translations commenced with the work of [[Max Müller|Müller]] (1823–1900), in the monumental ''[[Sacred Books of the East]]'' (1879).

[[Max Müller]] rendered "advaita" as "[[Monism]]", as have many recent scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R.W. Perrett|title=Indian Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LDWSBgAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Springer Science|isbn=978-94-009-2458-1|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S Menon (2011), [http://www.iep.utm.edu/adv-veda/ Advaita Vedanta], IEP, Quote:"The essential philosophy of Advaita is an idealist monism, and is considered to be presented first in the Upaniṣads and consolidated in the Brahma Sūtra by this tradition."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

Mark Heim|title=The Depth of the Riches: A Trinitarian Theology of Religious Ends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SDDskenlLH8C&amp;pg=PA227|year=2001|publisher=Wm. B.

==Definitions==
{{See also|Monism|Mind-body dualism|Dualistic cosmology|Pluralism (philosophy)}}

Nondualism is a [[fuzzy concept]], for which many definitions can be found.{{refn|group=note|See [http://www.nonduality.com/faq.htm#q1 Nonduality.com, ''FAQ''] and [http://www.nonduality.com/whatis.htm Nonduality.com, ''What is Nonduality, Nondualism, or Advaita? Over 100 definitions, descriptions, and discussions''].}}

According to Espín and Nickoloff, "nondualism" is the thought in some [[Hindu]], [[Buddhist]] and [[Tao]]ist schools, which
{{quote|... teaches that the multiplicity of the universe is reducible to one essential reality."{{sfn|Espín|Nickoloff|2007|p=963}}}}

According to Jeff Foster,
{{quote|'Non-duality'[...] points to the essential oneness (wholeness, completeness, unity) of life, a wholeness which exists here and now, prior to any apparent separation [...] despite the compelling appearance of separation and diversity there is only one universal essence, one reality. Oneness is all there is – and we are included.&lt;ref group=web name="JF"&gt;[http://www.lifewithoutacentre.com/writings/what-is-nonduality/ ''What is Non-Duality?'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jeff Foster further explains
{{quote|What you are is simply this open space of awareness (consciousness, awakeness, Being) in which absolutely everything seems to come and go, and that space is already at rest; it’s already Home.&lt;ref group=web name="JF"/&gt;}}

[[David Loy]], who sees non-duality between subject and object as a common thread in Taoism, Mahayana Buddhism, and Advaita Vedanta,{{sfn|Loy|1988|p=9–11}}{{refn|group=note|According to Loy, nondualism is primarily an Eastern way of understanding:
"...[the seed of nonduality] however often sown, has never found fertile soil [in the West], because it has been too antithetical to those other vigorous sprouts that have grown into modern science and technology. In the Eastern tradition [...] we encounter a different situation. There the seeds of seer-seen nonduality not only sprouted but matured into a variety (some might say a jungle) of impressive philosophical species. By no means do all these [Eastern] systems assert the nonduality of subject and object, but it is significant that three which do – Buddhism, Vedanta and Taoism – have probably been the most influential.{{sfn|Loy|1988|p=3}} According to Loy, referred by Pritscher:
{{quote|...when you realize that the nature of your mind and the [U]niverse are nondual, you are [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightened]].{{sfn|Pritscher|2001|p=16}}}}}} distinguishes "Five Flavors Of Nonduality":&lt;ref group=web name="Tao"&gt;[http://taoism.about.com/od/buddhism/a/Nonduality_Loy.htm Elizabeth Reninger, ''Guide Review: David Loy’s "Nonduality: A Study In Comparative Philosophy"'']&lt;/ref&gt;
# The negation of dualistic thinking in pairs of opposites. The Yin-Yang symbol of Taoism symbolises the transcendence of this dualistic way of thinking.&lt;ref group=web name="Tao" /&gt;
# ''Monism'', the nonplurality of the world. Although the phenomenal world appears as a plurality of "things", in reality they are "of a single cloth".&lt;ref group=web name="Tao" /&gt;
# ''Advaita'', the nondifference of subject and object, or nonduality between subject and object.&lt;ref group=web name="Tao" /&gt;
# ''Advaya'', the identity of phenomena and the Absolute, the "nonduality of duality and nonduality",&lt;ref group=web name="Tao" /&gt; c.q. the nonduality of relative and ultimate truth as found in Madhyamaka and the [[two truths doctrine]].
# ''Mysticism'', a mystical unity between God and man.&lt;ref group=web name="Tao" /&gt;

The idea of nondualism is typically contrasted with dualism, with dualism defined as the view that the universe and the nature of existence consists of two realities, such as the God and the world, or as God and Devil, or as mind and matter, and so on.&lt;ref name=Barton195&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen C.

The idea of a "nondual consciousness" has gained attraction and popularity in western spirituality and New Age-thinking. It is recognized in the Asian traditions, but also in western and Mediterranean religious traditions, and in western philosophy.{{sfn|Renard|2010}} Nondual consciousness is perceived in a wide variety of religious traditions:

==Hinduism==
"Advaita" refers to nondualism, non-distinction between realities, the oneness of Atman and Brahman, as in [[Vedanta]], [[Shaktism]] and [[Shaivism]].{{sfn|Espín|Nickoloff|2007|p=14}} Although the term is best known from the Advaita Vedanta school of Adi Shankara, "advaita" is used in treatises by numerous medieval era Indian scholars, as well as modern schools and teachers.{{refn|group=note|This is reflected in the name "Advaita Vision," the website of advaita.org.uk, which propagates a broad and inclusive understanding of ''advaita''.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.advaita.org.uk/index.html Advaita Vision - Ongoing Development]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Hindu concept of ''Advaita'' refers to the idea that all of the universe is one essential reality, and that all facets and aspects of the universe is ultimately an expression or appearance of that one reality.{{sfn|Espín|Nickoloff|2007|p=14}} According to Dasgupta and Mohanta, non-dualism developed in various strands of Indian thought, both Vedic and Buddhist, from the Upanishadic period onward.{{sfn|Dasgupta|Mohanta|1998|p=362}} The oldest traces of nondualism in Indian thought may be found in the [[Chandogya Upanishad]], which pre-dates the earliest Buddhism. [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism]] may also have been responding to the teachings of the [[Chandogya Upanishad]], rejecting some of its Atman-Brahman related metaphysics.{{sfn|Gombrich|1990|p=12-20}}{{refn|group=note|Edward Roer translates the early medieval era Brihadaranyakopnisad-bhasya as, "(...) Lokayatikas and Bauddhas who assert that the soul does not exist. There are four sects among the followers of Buddha: 1. Madhyamicas who maintain all is void; 2.

Several schools of Vedanta teach a form of nondualism. The best-known is Advaita Vedanta, but other nondual Vedanta schools also have a significant influence and following, such as [[Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]] and [[Shuddhadvaita]],{{sfn|Espín|Nickoloff|2007|p=14}} both of which are [[bhedabheda]].

====Advaita Vedanta====

The nonduality of the Advaita Vedantins is of the identity of [[Brahman]] and the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]].&lt;ref name="Craig, Edward 1998 p.476"&gt;Craig, Edward (general editor) (1998).

The oldest surviving manuscript on Advaita Vedanta is by [[Gaudapada|Gauḍapāda]] (6th century CE),{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}} who has traditionally been regarded as the teacher of [[Govinda bhagavatpāda]] and the grandteacher of Shankara. Advaita is best known from the Advaita Vedanta tradition of [[Adi Shankara]], who states that Brahman is pure Being, Consciousness and Bliss (''[[Satcitananda|Sat-cit-ananda]]'').{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=178}}

Advaita, states Murti, is the knowledge of Brahman and self-consciousness (Vijnana) without differences.{{sfn|Murti|2008|p=217}} The goal of [[Vedanta]] is to know the "truly real" and thus become one with it.{{sfn|Murti|2008|pp=217–218}} According to Advaita Vedanta, Brahman is the highest [[Absolute (philosophy)|Reality]],{{sfn|Potter|2008|p=6–7}}&lt;ref name=james122&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Brahman", ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism'', Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-8239-3179-8}}, page 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ptraju&gt;PT Raju (2006), ''Idealistic Thought of India'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1-4067-3262-7}}, page 426 and Conclusion chapter part XII&lt;/ref&gt; The universe, according to Advaita philosophy, does not simply come from Brahman, it ''is'' Brahman.

=====Advaita Vedanta – Three levels of reality=====
Advaita Vedanta adopts sublation as the criterion to postulate three levels of ontological reality:{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}&lt;ref name=asharmapr176&gt;Arvind Sharma (1995), The Philosophy of Religion and Advaita Vedanta, Penn State University Press, {{ISBN|978-0271028323}}, pp. 176–178 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''{{IAST|Pāramārthika}}'' (''paramartha'', absolute), the Reality that is metaphysically true and ontologically accurate. It is the state of experiencing that "which is absolutely real and into which both other reality levels can be resolved". This experience can't be sublated (exceeded) by any other experience.{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}&lt;ref name=asharmapr176/&gt;
* ''{{IAST|Vyāvahārika}}'' (''vyavahara''), or ''samvriti-saya'',{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} consisting of the empirical or pragmatic reality. It is ever-changing over time, thus empirically true at a given time and context but not [[metaphysics|metaphysically]] true. It is "our world of experience, the phenomenal world that we handle every day when we are awake". It is the level in which both ''[[jiva]]'' (living creatures or individual souls) and ''[[Iswara]]'' are true; here, the material world is also true.&lt;ref name=asharmapr176/&gt;
* ''{{IAST|Prāthibhāsika}}'' (''pratibhasika'', apparent reality, unreality), "reality based on imagination alone". It is the level of experience in which the mind constructs its own reality. A well-known example is the perception of a rope in the dark as being a snake.&lt;ref name=asharmapr176/&gt;

=====Similarities and differences with Buddhism=====
Scholars state that Advaita Vedanta was influenced by [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], given the common terminology and methodology and some common doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;John Grimes, Review of Richard King's Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism, Journal of the American Academy of Religion Vol. 66, No. 3 (Autumn, 1998), pp.&amp;nbsp;684–686&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Mudgal, ''Advaita of Sankara, A Reappraisal, Impact of Buddhism and Samkhya on Sankara's thought'', Delhi 1975, p.187"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eliot Deutsch]] and Rohit Dalvi state:
{{quote|In any event a close relationship between the Mahayana schools and Vedanta did exist, with the latter borrowing some of the dialectical techniques, if not the specific doctrines, of the former.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot Deutsch (1980), Advaita Vedanta: A Philosophical Reconstruction, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824802714}}, pp.` 126, 157&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Advaita Vedanta is related to Madhyamaka via Gaudapada, who took over the Buddhist doctrine that [[Yogacara#Representation-only|ultimate reality is pure consciousness (''vijñapti-mātra'')]].{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}} Shankara harmonised [[Gaudapada]]'s ideas with the Upanishadic texts, and provided an orthodox hermeneutical basis for heterodox Buddhist phenomology.{{sfn|Isaeva|1992|p=240}}{{sfn|Sharma|2000|p=64}}

Gaudapada adopted the Buddhist concept of [[Yogacara#Representation-only|ultimate reality is pure consciousness (''vijñapti-mātra'')]].{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}} The Buddhist term is often used interchangeably with the term ''citta-mātra'', but they have different meanings. The standard translation of both terms is "consciousness-only" or "mind-only." Advaita Vedanta has been called "idealistic monism" by scholars, but some disagree with this label.&lt;ref&gt;JN Mohanty (1980), Understanding some Ontological Differences in Indian Philosophy, Journal of Indian Philosophy, Volume 8, Issue 3, page 205; Quote: "Nyaya-Vaiseshika is realistic; Advaita Vedanta is idealistic. The former is pluralistic, the latter monistic."&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=1}} Another concept found in both Madhyamaka Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta is [[Ajativada]] ("ajāta"), which Gaudapada adopted from [[Nagarjuna]]'s philosophy.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=35-36}}{{refn|group=note|"A" means "not", or "non"; "jāti" means "creation" or "origination;{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} "vāda" means "doctrine"{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}}}} Gaudapada "wove [both doctrines] into a philosophy of the ''Mandukaya Upanisad'', which was further developed by Shankara.{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177-178}}{{refn|group=note|The influence of [[Mahayana Buddhism]] on other religions and philosophies was not limited to Advaita Vedanta. Kalupahana notes that the [[Visuddhimagga]] contains "some metaphysical speculations, such as those of the Sarvastivadins, the Sautrantikas, and even the [[Yogacara|Yogacarins]]".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=206}}}}

Michael Comans states there is a fundamental difference between Buddhist thought and that of Gaudapada, in that Buddhism has as its philosophical basis the doctrine of [[Dependent Origination]] according to which "everything is without an essential nature (''nissvabhava''), and everything is empty of essential nature (''svabhava-sunya'')", while Gaudapada does not rely on this principle at all. Gaudapada's ''Ajativada'' is an outcome of reasoning applied to an unchanging nondual reality according to which "there exists a Reality (''sat'') that is unborn (''aja'')" that has essential nature (''svabhava''), and this is the "eternal, fearless, undecaying Self (Atman) and Brahman".{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=88–93}} Thus, Gaudapada differs from Buddhist scholars such as Nagarjuna, states Comans, by accepting the premises and relying on the fundamental teaching of the Upanishads.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=88–93}} Among other things, Vedanta school of Hinduism holds the premise, "Atman exists, as self evident truth", a concept it uses in its theory of nondualism. Buddhism, in contrast, holds the premise, "Atman does not exist (or, An-atman) as self evident".&lt;ref&gt;Dae-Sook Suh (1994), Korean Studies: New Pacific Currents, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824815981}}, pp. 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=johnplott3&gt;John C.

Mahadevan suggests that Gaudapada adopted Buddhist terminology and adapted its doctrines to his Vedantic goals, much like early Buddhism adopted Upanishadic terminology and adapted its doctrines to Buddhist goals; both used pre-existing concepts and ideas to convey new meanings.&lt;ref name=johnplottghp286&gt;John Plott (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Patristic-Sutra period (325 – 800 AD), Volume 3, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120805507}}, pages 285-288&lt;/ref&gt; Dasgupta and Mohanta note that Buddhism and Shankara's Advaita Vedanta are not opposing systems, but "different phases of development of the same non-dualistic metaphysics from the Upanishadic period to the time of Sankara."{{sfn|Dasgupta|Mohanta|1998|p=362}}

====Vishishtadvaita Vedanta====
[[File:Ramanujacharya.jpg|thumb|[[Ramanuja]], founder of Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, taught 'qualified nondualism' doctrine.]]
{{See also|Bhedabheda}}
[[Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]] is another main school of Vedanta and teaches the nonduality of the qualified whole, in which Brahman alone exists, but is characterized by multiplicity. It can be described as "qualified monism," or "qualified non-dualism," or "attributive [[monism]]."

According to this school, the world is real, yet underlying all the differences is an all-embracing unity, of which all "things" are an "attribute." [[Ramanuja]], the main proponent of Vishishtadvaita philosophy contends that the Prasthana Traya ("The three courses") – namely the [[Upanishad]]s, the [[Gita|Bhagavad Gita]], and the [[Brahmasutra|Brahma Sutras]] – are to be interpreted in a way that shows this unity in diversity, for any other way would violate their consistency.

[[Vedanta Desika]] defines ''Vishishtadvaita'' using the statement: ''Asesha Chit-Achit Prakaaram Brahmaikameva Tatvam'' – "[[Brahman]], as qualified by the sentient and insentient modes (or attributes), is the only reality."

====Neo-Vedanta====
{{Main|Neo-Vedanta|Swami Vivekananda|Ramakrishna Mission}}
Neo-Vedanta, also called "neo-Hinduism"{{sfn|King|2002|p=93}} is a modern interpretation of [[Hinduism]] which developed in response to western [[colonialism]] and [[orientalism]], and aims to present Hinduism as a "homogenized ideal of Hinduism"{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=338}} with Advaita Vedanta as its central doctrine.{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}}

[[Neo-Vedanta]], as represented by [[Vivekananda]] and [[Radhakrishnan]], is indebted to Advaita vedanta, but also reflects Advaya-philosophy. A main influence on neo-Advaita was [[:Ramakrishna]], himself a bhakta and tantrika, and the guru of Vivekananda. According to Michael Taft, Ramakrishna reconciled the dualism of formlessness and form.{{sfn|Taft|2014}} Ramakrishna regarded the Supreme Being to be both Personal and Impersonal, active and inactive:
{{quote|When I think of the Supreme Being as inactive – neither creating nor preserving nor destroying – I call Him Brahman or Purusha, the Impersonal God. When I think of Him as active – creating, preserving and destroying – I call Him Sakti or Maya or Prakriti, the Personal God. But the distinction between them does not mean a difference. The Personal and Impersonal are the same thing, like milk and its whiteness, the diamond and its lustre, the snake and its wriggling motion. It is impossible to conceive of the one without the other. The Divine Mother and Brahman are one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sri Ramakrisha The Great Master, by Swami Saradananda, (tr.) Swami Jagadananda, 5th ed., v.1,  pp. 558–561, Sri Ramakrishna Math, Madras.|url=http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/sri-ramakrishna-the-great-master/}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Radhakrishnan acknowledged the reality and diversity of the world of experience, which he saw as grounded in and supported by the absolute or Brahman.&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="Neo-Vedanta|Neo-Vedanta seems to be closer to [[Bhedabheda]]-Vedanta than to Shankara's Advaita Vedanta, with the acknowledgement of the reality of the world. Nicholas F. Gier: "Ramakrsna, Svami Vivekananda, and Aurobindo (I also include M.K. Gandhi) have been labeled "neo-Vedantists," a philosophy that rejects the Advaitins' claim that the world is illusory. Aurobindo, in his ''The Life Divine'', declares that he has moved from Sankara's  "universal illusionism" to his own "universal realism" (2005: 432), defined as metaphysical realism in the European philosophical sense of the term."{{sfn|Gier|2013}}}} According to Anil Sooklal, Vivekananda's neo-Advaita "reconciles [[Dvaita]] or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism":{{sfn|Sooklal|1993|p=33}}
{{quote|The Neo-Vedanta is also Advaitic inasmuch as it holds that Brahman, the Ultimate Reality, is one without a second, ''ekamevadvitiyam''. But as distinguished from the traditional Advaita of Sankara, it is a synthetic Vedanta which reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism and also other theories of reality. In this sense it may also be called concrete monism in so far as it holds that Brahman is both qualified, ''saguna'', and qualityless, ''nirguna''.{{sfn|Sooklal|1993|p=33}}}}

Radhakrishnan also reinterpreted Shankara's notion of ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]''. According to Radhakrishnan, maya is not a strict absolute idealism, but "a subjective misperception of the world as ultimately real."&lt;ref group=web name="IEP"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/radhakri/#H2 Michael Hawley, ''Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1888–1975)'', Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sarma, standing in the tradition of [[Nisargadatta Maharaj]], Advaitavāda means "spiritual non-dualism or absolutism",{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=1}} in which opposites are ''manifestations'' of the Absolute, which itself is immanent and transcendent:{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=1–2}}
{{quote|All opposites like being and non-being, life and death, good and evil, light and darkness, gods and men, soul and nature are viewed as manifestations of the Absolute which is immanent in the universe and yet transcends it.{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=1-2}}}}

===Kashmir Shaivism===

{{Saivism}}
Advaita is also a central concept in various schools of Shaivism, such as [[Kashmir Shaivism]]{{sfn|Espín|Nickoloff|2007|p=14}} and [[Shiva Advaita]].

Kashmir Shaivism is a school of [[Śaivism]], described by [[Abhinavagupta]]{{refn|group=note|Abhinavgupta (between 10th – 11th century AD) who summarized the view points of all previous thinkers and presented the philosophy in a logical way along with his own thoughts in his treatise Tantraloka.&lt;ref group=web name="Kashmir" /&gt;}} as "paradvaita", meaning "the supreme and absolute non-dualism".&lt;ref group=web name="Kashmir"&gt;[http://www.shaivism.net/articles/11.html Piyaray L.

Kashmir Saivism is based on a strong monistic interpretation of the ''Bhairava Tantras'' and its subcategory the ''Kaula Tantras'', which were tantras written by the [[Kapalikas]].&lt;ref name="Flood, Gavin 1996. P.164-167"&gt;Flood, Gavin. D. 1996. An Introduction to Hinduism. pp. 164–167&lt;/ref&gt; There was additionally a revelation of the ''Siva Sutras'' to [[Vasugupta]].&lt;ref name="Flood, Gavin 1996.

P.164-167"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin. D. 2006. The Tantric Body. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy of Kashmir Shaivism can be seen in contrast to Shankara's Advaita.&lt;ref&gt;Consciousness is Everything, The Yoga of Kashmir Shaivism, Swami Shankarananda pp. 56-59&lt;/ref&gt; Advaita Vedanta holds that Brahman is inactive (''niṣkriya'') and the phenomenal world is an illusion (''māyā''). In Kashmir Shavisim, all things are a manifestation of the Universal Consciousness, ''[[Chit (Shaivism)|Chit]]'' or ''[[Brahman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pratyãbhijñahṛdayam, Jaideva Singh, Moltilal Banarsidass, 2008 p.24-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Doctrine of Vibration: An Analysis of Doctrines and Practices of Kashmir Shaivism, By Mark S.

Dyczkowski, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; Kashmir Shavisim sees the phenomenal world (''Śakti'') as real: it exists, and has its being in Consciousness (''Chit'').&lt;ref&gt;Ksemaraja, trans. by Jaidev Singh, Spanda Karikas: The Divine Creative Pulsation, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Kashmir Shaivism was influenced by, and took over doctrines from, several orthodox and heterodox Indian religious and philosophical traditions.{{sfn|Muller-Ortega|2010|p=25}} These include Vedanta, Samkhya, Patanjali Yoga and Nyayas, and various Buddhist schools, including Yogacara and Madhyamika,{{sfn|Muller-Ortega|2010|p=25}} but also Tantra and the Nath-tradition.{{sfn|Muller-Ortega|2010|p=26}}

===Contemporary vernacular Advaita===
''Advaita'' is also part of other Indian traditions, which are less strongly, or not all, organised in monastic and institutional organisations. Although often called "Advaita Vedanta," these traditions have their origins in vernacular movements and "householder" traditions, and have close ties to the [[Nath]], [[Nayanars]] and [[Sant Mat]] traditions.

====Natha Sampradaya and Inchegeri Sampradaya====
{{Main article|Nath|Sahaja|Inchegeri Sampradaya}}

The Natha Sampradaya, with [[Nath]] yogis such as [[Gorakhnath]], introduced [[Sahaja]], the concept of a spontaneous spirituality. Sahaja means "spontaneous, natural, simple, or easy".&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw1193-sah.jpg] (accessed: Friday November 6, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ken Wilber, this state reflects nonduality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ken Wilber |title=One Taste: Daily Reflections on Integral Spirituality |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YhbLjCH9aFMC&amp;pg=PA294 |year=2000|publisher=Shambhala Publications|isbn=978-0-8348-2270-2 |pages=294–295 with footnotes 33–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
The Advaya concept of nonduality refers to the "non-two" understanding of reality, which has its origins in Madhyamaka-thought, which in turn is built on earlier Buddhist thought, and expressed in the two truths doctrine. In Nagarjuna's interpretation it is the non-duality of conventional and ultimate truth, or the overcoming of dichotomies such as that between [[samsara]] (conditioned or relative reality, rebirth) and [[nirvana]] (unconditioned and absolute reality, liberation).&lt;ref name="Davis2010p5"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leesa S. Davis|title=Advaita Vedanta and Zen Buddhism: Deconstructive Modes of Spiritual Inquiry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_kHcG0tspgC |year=2010|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-2068-8 |pages=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy McCagney |title=Nāgārjuna and the Philosophy of Openness |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yCH7ueXrJowC |date=1997 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0-8476-8627-8 |pages=40–41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nondualism in Buddhism is explicitly represented by the concept of Buddha-nature, and Tibetan concepts like rigpa and shentong. It has its roots in Buddhist ideas of luminous mind, the "pure" consciousness which shines through when purified from the defilements of hatred, anger and ignorance. Nondualism can also be found in Yogacara thought, and its concept of the alaija-vijnana. Subsequently, combinations of Buddha-nature thought and Yogacara, and also of Yogacara and Madhyamaka, developed in India, Tibet and China, and can be found in Tibetan Buddhism and Zen.

The nonduality of relative and ultimate truth was further developed and re-interpreted in Chinese Buddhism, where the two truths doctrine came to refer to the nonduality of nirvana and samsara, re-incorporating essentialist notions.

===Indian Buddhism===

====Madhyamaka – nonduality of conventional and ultimate truth====
{{Main|Madhyamika|Shunyata|Two truths doctrine}}
[[File:Nagarjuna and Aryadeva as Two Great Indian Buddhist Scholastics - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nagarjuna]] and [[Aryadeva]]]]

In Madhyamaka Buddhism ''Advaya'' refers to the nonduality of conventional and ultimate truth,{{sfn|Garfield|1995|pp=296, 298}} or the relative (phenomenal) world and the Absolute, such as in [[samsara]] and [[nirvana]].{{sfn|Espín|Nickoloff|2007|p=14}} Madhyamaka, also known as ''Śūnyavāda'', refers primarily to a [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] school of philosophy{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=140}} founded by [[Nāgārjuna]].

In Madhyamaka, the two truths refer to conventional and ultimate truth.{{sfn|Cheng|1981}} The ultimate truth is [[Sunyata|"emptiness"]], or non-existence of inherently existing "things",{{sfn|Kalupahana|2006|p=1}} and the "emptiness of emptiness": emptiness does not in itself constitute an absolute reality. Conventionally, "things" exist, but ultimately, they are "empty" of any existence on their own, as described in [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna's]] ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'':
{{quote|The Buddha's teaching of the Dharma is based on two truths: a truth of worldly convention and an ultimate truth. Those who do not understand the distinction drawn between these two truths do not understand the Buddha's profound truth. Without a foundation in the conventional truth the significance of the ultimate cannot be taught. Without understanding the significance of the ultimate, liberation is not achieved.{{refn|group=note|Nagarjuna, Mūlamadhyamakakārika 24:8-10. Jay L. Garfield, ''Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way''{{sfn|Garfield|1995|pp=296, 298}}}}}}

"Emptiness" is a consequence of ''[[pratītyasamutpāda]]'' (dependent arising),{{sfn|Cabezón|2005|p=9387}} the teaching that no ''dharma'' ("thing") has an existence of its own, but always comes into existence in dependence on other ''dharmas''. According to Madhyamaka all [[Dharma#Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology|phenomena]] are [[śūnyatā|empty]] of "substance" or "essence" ({{lang-sa|[[svabhāva]]}}) because they are [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependently co-arisen]]. Likewise it is because they are dependently co-arisen that they have no intrinsic, independent reality of their own. Madhyamaka also rejects the existence of an absolute reality or Self.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994}} Ultimately, "absolute reality" is not an absolute, or the non-duality of a personal self and an absolute Self, but the deconstruction of such reifications.

It also means that there is no "transcendental ground," and that "ultimate reality" has no existence of its own, but is the negation of such a transcendental reality, and the impossibility of any statement on such an ultimately existing transcendental reality: it is no more than a fabrication of the mind.&lt;ref group=web name="PatrickJennings" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|See, for an influential example, [[Tsongkhapa]], who states that "things" ''do'' exist conventionally, but ultimately everything is dependently arisen, and therefor void of inherent existence.&lt;ref group=web name="PatrickJennings"&gt;[http://thenonbuddhist.com/2014/01/12/tsongkhapa-in-praise-of-relativity-the-essence-of-eloquence/ Patrick Jennings, ''Tsongkhapa: In Praise of Relativity; The Essence of Eloquence''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518074106/http://thenonbuddhist.com/2014/01/12/tsongkhapa-in-praise-of-relativity-the-essence-of-eloquence/ |date=18 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Susan Kahn further explains:
{{quote|Ultimate truth does not point to a transcendent reality, but to the transcendence of deception. It is critical to emphasize that the ultimate truth of emptiness is a negational truth. In looking for inherently existent phenomena it is revealed that it cannot be found. This absence is not findable because it is not an entity, just as a room without an elephant in it does not contain an elephantless substance. Even conventionally, elephantlessness does not exist. Ultimate truth or emptiness does not point to an essence or nature, however subtle, that everything is made of.&lt;ref group=web name="SusanKahn"&gt;[http://emptinessteachings.com/2014/09/11/the-two-truths-of-buddhism-and-the-emptiness-of-emptiness/ Susan Kahn, ''The Two Truths of Buddhism and The Emptiness of Emptiness'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Madhyamaka-Buddhism, "Advaya" is an epistemological approach.{{sfn|Murti|2008|p=217}} It is the recognition that ultimately everything is impermanent ([[anicca]]) and devoid of "self" or "essence" ([[anatta]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

The later Madhyamikas, states Yuichi Kajiyama, developed the ''Advaya'' definition as a means to ''Nirvikalpa-Samadhi'' by suggesting that "things arise neither from their own selves nor from other things, and that when subject and object are unreal, the mind, being not different, cannot be true either; thereby one must abandon attachment to cognition of nonduality as well, and understand the lack of intrinsic nature of everything". Thus, the Buddhist nondualism or Advaya concept became a means to realizing absolute emptiness.&lt;ref name="KiyotaJones1991p120" /&gt;

====Yogacara====
{{Main|Yogacara}}

In Yogacara, ''adhyava'' may also refer to overcoming the dichotomies of cognitum and cognition imposed by conceptual thought.{{sfn|Espín|Nickoloff|2007|p=14}} Yogācāra ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]; literally: "yoga practice"; "one whose practice is yoga"){{sfn|Jones|2005|p=9897}} is an influential school of [[Buddhist]] [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] emphasizing [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and (some argue){{clarify|date=March 2017}} [[ontology]]&lt;ref&gt;''Buddhahood Embodied: Sources of Controversy in India and Tibet'' by John Makransky.

It developed within [[India]]n [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] [[Buddhism]] in about the 4th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Zim, Robert (1995). ''Basic ideas of ''Yogācāra'' Buddhism.'' San Francisco State University. Source: [http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/Yogacara/basicideas.htm] (accessed: October 18, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''adyava'' in Yogacara is an epistemological stance on the nature of knowledge. Early Buddhism schools such as [[Sarvastivada]] and [[Sautrāntika]], that thrived through the early centuries of the common era, postulated a dualism, ''dvaya'', wherein grasping (''grahaka'', "cognition") and the grasped (''gradya'', "cognitum"){{sfn|King|1995|p=156}} both are really existing.&lt;ref name="KiyotaJones1991p120"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuichi Kajiyama |editor=Minoru Kiyota and Elvin W.

In Yogacara-thought, cognition is a modification of the base-consciousness, ''alaya-vijnana''. By the reification of these modifications into separate consciousnesses, the Eighth Consciousnesses of Yogacara came into existence.{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999}} In later Buddhist thought, which took an idealistic turn, the storehouse-consciousness or base-consciousness came to be seen as a pure consciousness, from which everything arises. According to the [[Lankavatara Sutra]] and the schools of Chan/Zen Buddhism, the alaya-vijnana is identical with the ''[[tathagata-garbha]]''{{refn|group=note|The womb or matrix of the Thus-come-one, the Buddha}}, and is fundamentally pure.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha.'' In Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press 1989, pages 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vijñapti-mātra'', coupled with ''[[Buddha-nature]]'' or ''tathagatagarba'', has been an influential concept in the subsequent development of Mahayana Buddhism, not only in India, but also in China and Tibet, most notable in the Chán (Zen) and Dzogchen traditions.

According to Kochumuttom, Yogacara is a ''realistic pluralism''. It does not deny the existence of individual beings,  but denies the following:{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=1}}
{{quote|1. That the absolute mode of reality is consciousness/mind/ideas,&lt;br /&gt;2. That the individual beings are transformations or evolutes of an absolute consciousness/mind/idea,&lt;br /&gt;3. That the individual beings are but illusory appearances of a monistic reality.{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=1-2}}}}

''[[Yogacara#Representation-only|Vijñapti-mātra]]'', "consciousness-only" or "representation-only" is one of the main features of Yogācāra philosophy. It is often used interchangeably with the term ''citta-mātra'', but they have different meanings. The standard translation of both terms is "consciousness-only" or "mind-only." Several modern researchers object to this translation, and the accompanying label of "absolute idealism" or "idealistic monism".{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=1}} A better translation for ''vijñapti-mātra'' is ''representation-only''.{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=5}}

''Vijñapti-mātra'' then means "mere representation of consciousness":
{{quote|[T]he phrase ''vijñaptimātratā-vāda'' means a theory which says that the world ''as it appears'' to the unenlightened ones is mere representation of consciousness. Therefore, any attempt to interpret ''vijñaptimātratā-vāda'' as idealism would be a gross misunderstanding of it.{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=5}}}}

The term ''vijñapti-mātra'' replaced the "more metaphysical"{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=135}} term ''citta-mātra'' used in the Lankavatara Sutra.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=126}} The Lankavatara Sutra "appears to be one of the earliest attempts to provide a philosophical justification for the Absolutism that emerged in Mahayana in relation to the concept of Buddha".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=122}} It uses the term ''citta-mātra'', which means properly "thought-only". By using this term it develops an ''ontology'', in contrast to the ''epistemology'' of the term vijñapti-mātra. The Lankavatara Sutra equates ''citta'' and the absolute. According to Kochumuttom, this is not the way Yogacara uses the term vijñapti:{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=5-6}}
{{quote|[T]he absolute state is defined simply as emptiness, namely the emptiness of subject–object distinction. Once thus defined as emptiness (''sunyata''), it receives a number of synonyms, none of which betray idealism.{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=6}}}}

The Yogācārins defined three basic modes by which we perceive our world.  These are referred to in Yogācāra as the three natures of perception.  They are:
# ''Parikalpita'' (literally, "fully conceptualized"): "imaginary nature", wherein things are incorrectly comprehended based on conceptual construction, through attachment and erroneous discrimination.
# ''Paratantra'' (literally, "other dependent"): "dependent nature", by which the correct understanding of the [[dependently originated]] nature of things is understood.
# ''Pariniṣpanna'' (literally, "fully accomplished"): "absolute nature", through which one comprehends things as they are in themselves, uninfluenced by any conceptualization at all.

Also, regarding perception, the Yogācārins emphasized that our everyday understanding of the existence of external objects is problematic, since in order to perceive any object (and thus, for all practical purposes, for the object to "exist"), there must be a sensory organ as well as a correlative type of consciousness to allow the process of cognition to occur.

====Buddha-nature====

{{See also|Pre-sectarian Buddhism#Schayer – Precanonical Buddhism|l1=Precanonical Buddhism}}
''Vijñapti-mātra'' and the two truths doctrine, as understood in Chinese Buddhism, are closely linked to ''[[Buddha-nature]]''. Those teachings have had a profound influence on Mahayana Buddhism, not only in India, but also in China and Tibet, most notably the Chán (Zen) and Dzogchen traditions. They may be related to an archaic form of Buddhism which is close to Brahmanical beliefs, elements of which are preserved in the Nikayas,{{sfn|Lindtner|1997}}{{sfn|Lindtner|1999}}{{sfn|Akizuki|1990|p=25-27}}{{sfn|Ray|1999}} and survived in the Mahayana tradition.{{sfn|Reat|1998|p=xi}}{{sfn|Conze|1967|p=10}} Contrary to popular opinion, the Theravada and Mahayana traditions may be "divergent, but equally reliable records of a pre-canonical Buddhism which is now lost forever."{{sfn|Reat|1998|p=xi}} The Mahayana tradition may have preserved a very old, "pre-Canonical" tradition, which was largely, but not completely, left out of the Theravada-canon.{{sfn|Conze|1967|p=10}}

The Buddhist teachings on the ''Buddha-nature'' may be regarded as a form of nondualism.&lt;ref&gt;King (1991), ''Buddha Nature'', SUNY Press&lt;/ref&gt; ''Buddha-nature'' is the essential element that allows [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] to become Buddhas.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhist Thought.'' Routledge 2000, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The term, Buddha nature, is a translation of the Sanskrit coinage, 'Buddha-dhātu', which seems first to have appeared in the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'', Second Edition, Routledge, Oxford, 2009, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; where it refers to 'a sacred nature that is the basis for [beings'] becoming buddhas.'&lt;ref name="Kevin Trainor 2004, p. 207"&gt;Kevin Trainor, ''Buddhism: The Illustrated Guide'', Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; The term seems to have been used most frequently to translate the Sanskrit "''Tathāgatagarbha''". The Sanskrit term "''tathāgatagarbha''" may be [[parse]]d into ''[[tathāgata]]'' ("the one thus gone", referring to the Buddha) and ''garbha'' ("womb").{{refn|group=note|The term "garbha" has multiple denotations. A denotation of note is the [[garba (dance)|garba]] of the [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]]: where a spiritual [[circle dance]] is performed around a light or candle placed at the centre, ''[[bindu (symbol)|bindu]]''. This dance informs the ''Tathāgatagarbha'' Doctrine. The ''[[Dzogchenpa]]'' ''[[tertön]]'' [[Namkai Norbu]] teaches a similar dance upon a [[mandala]], the Dance of the [[Six Lokas]] as ''[[terma (Buddhism)|terma]]'', where a candle or light is similarly placed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}}} The tathagatagarbha, when freed from ''avidya'' ("ignorance"), is the [[dharmakaya]], the ''Absolute''.

====Tantric Buddhism====
{{Main|Tantra}}

Tantra is a religious tradition that originated in India in the middle of the first millennium CE, and has been practiced by Buddhists, Hindus and Jains throughout south and southeast Asia.{{sfn|White|2000|p=7}} It views humans as a microcosmos which mirrors the macrocosmos.{{sfn|White|2000|p=8-9}} Its aim is to gain access to the energy or enlightened consciousness of the godhead or absolute, by embodying this energy or consciousness through rituals.{{sfn|White|2000|p=8-9}} It views the godhead as both transcendent and immanent, and views the world as real, and not as an illusion:{{sfn|White|2000|p=9}}
{{quote|Rather than attempting to see through or transcend the world, the practitioner comes to recognize "that" (the world) as "I" (the supreme egoity of the godhead): in other words, s/he gains a "god's eye view" of the universe, and recognizes it to be nothing other than herself/himself. For East Asian Buddhist Tantra in particular, this means that the totality of the cosmos is a "realm of Dharma", sharing an underlying common principle.{{sfn|White|2000|p=10–11}}}}

[[Ramakrishna]] too was a tantric adherent, although his tantric background was overlaid and smoothed with an Advaita interpretation by his student [[Vivekananda]].{{sfn|King|2002}}

===East-Asian Buddhism===

====Chinese Buddhism – nonduality of mundane and highest reality====
{{Main|Buddhism in China}}

In Chinese Buddhism the [[Two truths doctrine]] was interpreted as an ontological teaching of three truths,&lt;ref name=whalenlai45&gt;{{cite journal|author=Whalen Lai|title=Nonduality of the Two Truths in Sinitic Madhyamika: Origin of the Third Truth |journal=The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies|volume=2|number=2|year=1979|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; states Whalen Lai, wherein "[[samsara|samsaric]] being and [[nirvana|nirvanic]] emptiness as well any and all distinctions are not two".{{sfn|Lai|2003|pp=10–11}} The Chinese Buddhist scholars posited that there is a third truth above the mundane truth of samsaric being and the highest truth nirvanic emptiness (sunyata).{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=11}}&lt;ref name=whalenlai45 /&gt; In one description, everything is posited to be simultaneously "empty, real and neither".{{sfn|Lai|2003|pp=10–11}} According to Lai, most scholars of Chinese Buddhism, unlike Nagarjuna, failed to realize that the two truths were epistemic, not ontological.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=11}} This mistake was identified and discussed by Jizang of Sanlun school.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=11}}

Chinese Buddhism evolved over time.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=10}} Before 400 CE, states Lai, the Chinese understood the Buddhist doctrine to be that "karmic rebirth entailed the transmigration of soul".{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=10}} It was monk Mindu who understood that the Buddha taught a no soul doctrine, and he tried to explain this to his Buddhist ''sangha'', but was vilified for denying the existence of soul.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=10}} Mindu's ideas, however, began a momentum that led to the emergence of ''six prajna'' schools in the 4th and 5th century CE.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=10}} In the 6th century CE it became clear that anatman and sunyata are central Buddhist teachings, which make the postulation of an eternal self problematic.{{sfn|Lai|2003|pp=10-11}}&lt;ref name=Whalenlai47&gt;{{cite journal|author=Whalen Lai| title=Nonduality of the Two Truths in Sinitic Madhyamika: Origin of the Third Truth | journal= The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies| volume= 2| number= 2|year = 1979| pages=45–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another point of confusion was the [[Two truths doctrine]] of [[Madhyamaka]], the mundane truth and the highest truth. Chinese thinking took this to refer to two ''ontological truths'': reality exists at two levels, the mundane level of samsara and the highest level of nirvana emptiness. But in Madhyamaka these are two ''epistemological truths'', two different ways to look at reality. The early Chinese scholars supposed that there is an essential truth above the two truths, which unites both these.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=11}}&lt;ref name=Whalenlai47 /&gt; This three truths doctrine was different from a similarly named doctrine of Yogacara and Indian Buddhism.&lt;ref name=Whalenlai47 /&gt;

====Hua-yen Buddhism====
{{Main|Huayan school|Indra's net}}
The Huayan school or Flower Garland is a tradition of [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhist]] [[philosophy]] that flourished in [[China]] during the [[Tang period]] particularly with [[Fazang]] (~700 CE). It is based on the Sanskrit [[Avatamsaka Sutra|Flower Garland Sutra]] (S. ''Avataṃsaka Sūtra'', C. ''Huayan Jing'') and on a lengthy Chinese interpretation of it, the [[Huayan Lun]].  The name Flower Garland is meant to suggest the crowning glory of profound understanding. Huayan teaches the [[Four Dharmadhatu]], four ways to view reality:
# All dharmas are seen as particular separate events;
# All events are an expression of the absolute;
# Events and essence interpenetrate;
# All events interpenetrate.{{sfn|Garfield|Edelglass|2011|p=76}}

====Zen Buddhism====
[[File:DogenP2.JPG|thumb|[[Dogen]]]]
{{Main|Zen|Buddha-nature|Kenshō|Shikan-taza}}
{{See also|Bodhicitta|Karuṇā|Ten Bulls}}

The Buddha-nature and Yogacara philosophies have had a strong influence on Chán and Zen. The teachings of Zen are expressed by a set of polarities: Buddha-nature – sunyata;{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|pp=26–29}}{{sfn|McRae|2003|pp=138–142}} absolute-relative;{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}} [[Subitism|sudden]] and gradual enlightenment.{{sfn|McRae|2003|pp=123–138}}

The Lankavatara-sutra, a popular sutra in Zen, endorses the Buddha-nature and emphasizes purity of mind, which can be attained in gradations. The Diamond-sutra, another popular sutra, emphasizes sunyata, which "must be realized totally or not at all".{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|pp=26–28}} The [[Prajnaparamita]] Sutras emphasize the non-duality of form and emptiness: form is emptiness, emptiness is form, as the [[Heart Sutra]] says.{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}} According to [[Chinul]], Zen points not to mere emptiness, but to ''suchness'' or the [[dharmadhatu]].{{sfn|Buswell|1991|p=240-241}}

The idea that the ultimate reality is present in the daily world of relative reality fitted into the Chinese culture which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not explain how the absolute is present in the relative world. This question is answered in such schemata as [[Five Ranks|the Five Ranks of Tozan]]{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|p=29}} and the [[Ten Bulls|Oxherding Pictures]].

The continuous pondering of the break-through [[kōan]] (''shokan''{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=132}}) or [[Hua Tou]], "word head",{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=38}} leads to [[kensho]], an initial insight into "seeing the [[Buddha-nature|(Buddha-)nature]].{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=287}} According to Hori, a central theme of many koans is the "identity of opposites", and point to the original nonduality.{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=289–290}}{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=310 note 14}} Victor Sogen Hori describes [[kensho]], when attained through [[Koan|koan-study]], as the absence of subject–object duality.{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=30–31}} The aim of the so-called break-through koan is to see the "nonduality of subject and object", {{sfn|Hori|2000|p=289–290}}{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=310 note 14}}
in which "subject and object are no longer separate and distinct."{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=288–289}}

Zen Buddhist training does not end with kenshō. Practice is to be continued to deepen the insight and to express it in daily life,{{sfn|Sekida|1996}}{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=91}}{{sfn|Maezumi|Glassman|2007|pp=54, 140}} to fully manifest the nonduality of absolute and relative.{{sfn|Yen|1996|p=54}}{{sfn|Jiyu-Kennett|2005|p=225}} To deepen the initial insight of kensho, shikantaza and kōan-study are necessary. This trajectory of initial insight followed by a gradual deepening and ripening is expressed by [[Linji Yixuan]] in his [[Linji Yixuan#Three Mysterious Gates|Three Mysterious Gates]], the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Four Ways of Knowing]] of [[Hakuin]],{{sfn|Low|2006}} the [[Five Ranks]], and the [[Ten Bulls|Ten Ox-Herding Pictures]]{{sfn|Mumon|2004}} which detail the steps on the [[Buddhist Paths to liberation|Path]].

====Essence-function in Korean Buddhism====
{{See also|Korean Buddhism|Essence-Function}}
The polarity of absolute and relative is also expressed as "essence-function". The absolute is essence, the relative is function. They can't be seen as separate realities, but interpenetrate each other. The distinction does not "exclude any other frameworks such as ''neng-so'' or 'subject-object' constructions", though the two "are completely different from each other in terms of their way of thinking".&lt;ref&gt;Park, Sung-bae  (1983).

===Tibetan Buddhism===
{{Main|Vajrayana}}

====Adyava: Gelugpa school Prasangika Madhyamaka====
The Gelugpa school, following Tsongkhapa, adheres to the adyava [[Prasaṅgika]] [[Madhyamaka|Mādhyamaka]] view, which states that all phenomena are [[sunyata]], empty of self-nature, and that this "emptiness" is itself only a qualification, not a concretely existing "absolute" reality.&lt;ref name=Stearns&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stearns|first1=Cyrus|title=The Buddha from Dölpo: A Study of the Life and Thought of the Tibetan Master Dölpopa Sherab Gyaltsen|date=2010|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=978-1-55939-343-0|edition=Rev. and enl.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddha-nature and the nature of mind====

=====Shentong=====
{{Main|Rangtong-Shentong}}
In Tibetan Buddhism, the essentialist position is represented by ''shentong'', while the nominalist, or non-essentialist position, is represented by ''rangtong''.

Shentong is a philosophical sub-school found in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Its adherents generally hold that the nature of mind, the substratum of the [[mindstream]], is "empty" ({{bo|w=stong}}) of "other" ({{bo|w=gzhan}}), i.e., empty of all qualities other than an inherently existing, ineffable nature. Shentong has often been incorrectly associated with the Cittamātra ([[Yogacara]]) position, but is in fact also Madhyamaka,&lt;ref&gt;Stearns p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; and is present primarily as the main philosophical theory of the [[Jonang]] school, although it is also taught by the [[Sakya]]&lt;ref&gt;Stearns p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kagyu]] schools.&lt;ref name=TaiSitupa&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pema Tönyö Nyinje, 12th Tai Situpa|authorlink1=Pema Tönyö Nyinje|title=Ground, Path and Fruition|publisher=Zhyisil Chokyi Ghatsal Charitable Trust|isbn=978-1-877294-35-8|page=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hookham&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hookham|first1=S.K.|authorlink1=Shenpen Hookham|title=The Buddha Within: Tathagatagarbha Doctrine According to the Shentong Interpretation of the Ratnagotravibhaga|date=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=978-0-7914-0358-7|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Shentongpa (proponents of shentong), the emptiness of ultimate reality should not be characterized in the same way as the emptiness of apparent phenomena because it is ''[[ösel (yoga)|prabhāśvara]]-[[mindstream|saṃtāna]]'', or "luminous mindstream" endowed with limitless Buddha qualities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahs.org.uk/default.asp?action=article&amp;ID=1847 Lama Shenpen, ''Emptiness Teachings''. Buddhism Connect] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903121246/http://www.ahs.org.uk/default.asp?action=article&amp;ID=1847 |date=3 September 2011 }} (accessed March, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; It is empty of all that is false, not empty of the limitless Buddha qualities that are its innate nature.

The contrasting [[Prasaṅgika]] view that all phenomena are [[sunyata]], empty of self-nature, and that this "emptiness" is not a concretely existing "absolute" reality, is labeled [[rangtong]], "empty of other."&lt;ref name=Stearns/&gt;

The shentong-view is related to the [[Ratnagotravibhāga]] sutra and the Yogacara-Madhyamaka synthesis of [[Śāntarakṣita]]. The truth of sunyata is acknowledged, but not considered to be the highest truth, which is the empty nature of mind. Insight into sunyata is preparatory for the recognition of the nature of mind.

=====Dzogchen=====
{{Main|Dzogchen|Rigpa}}

Dzogchen is concerned with the "natural state" and emphasizes direct experience. The state of nondual awareness is called ''[[rigpa]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} This primordial nature is clear light, unproduced and unchanging, free from all defilements. Through meditation, the [[Dzogchen]] practitioner experiences that thoughts have no substance. Mental phenomena arise and fall in the mind, but fundamentally they are empty. The practitioner then considers where the mind itself resides. Through careful examination one realizes that the mind is emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Powers|first=John|title=Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism|pages=334–342|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karma Lingpa]] (1326–1386) revealed "Self-Liberation through seeing with naked awareness" (''rigpa ngo-sprod'',{{refn|group=note|Full: ''rigpa ngo-sprod gcer-mthong rang-grol''{{sfn|Norbu|1989|p=x}}}}) which is attributed to [[Padmasambhava]].{{sfn|Norbu|1989|p=x}}{{refn|group=note|This text is part of a collection of teachings entitled "Profound Dharma of Self-Liberation through the Intention of the Peaceful and Wrathful Ones"{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}} (''zab-chos zhi khro dgongs pa rang grol'', also known as ''kar-gling zhi-khro''{{sfn|Norbu|1989|p=ix}}), which includes the two texts of ''[[Bardo Thodol|bar-do thos-grol]]'', the so-called "Tibetan Book of the Dead".{{sfn|Norbu|1989|p=xii}} The ''bar-do thos-grol'' was translated by Kazi Dawa Samdup (1868–1922), and edited and published by W.Y.

==Other eastern religions==
Apart from Hinduism and Buddhism, self-proclaimed nondualists have also discerned nondualism in other religious traditions.

===Sikhism===
Sikh theology suggests human souls and the monotheistic God are two different realities (dualism),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nirmal Kumar |title=Sikh Philosophy and Religion: 11th Guru Nanak Memorial Lectures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xh69K5Ilm3EC |year=2006|publisher=Sterling Publishers |isbn=978-1-932705-68-3 |pages=89–92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishing it from the monistic and various shades of nondualistic philosophies of other Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind-pal Singh Mandair|title=Religion and the Specter of the West: Sikhism, India, Postcoloniality, and the Politics of Translation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dzeCy_zL0Q8C |year=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-51980-9|pages=76, 430–432 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sikh scholars have attempted to explore nondualism exegesis of Sikh scriptures, such as during the neocolonial reformist movement by Bhai Vir Singh of the Singh Sabha.

===Taoism===
{{Main article|Taoism}}
[[File:Yin yang.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[Taijitu]]]]

Taoism's ''[[wu wei]]'' (Chinese ''wu'', not; ''wei'', doing) is a term with various translations{{refn|group=note|Inaction, non-action, nothing doing, without ado}} and interpretations designed to distinguish it from passivity. The concept of [[Yin and Yang]], often mistakenly conceived of as a symbol of dualism, is actually meant to convey the notion that all apparent opposites are complementary parts of a non-dual whole.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Erickson, Liam D. Murphy. ''A History of Anthropological Theory''. 2013. p. 486&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western traditions==
{{See also|Spirituality|New Age|Syncretism|Neo-Advaita|Western esotericism|Perennial philosophy{{!}}Perennialism|Syncretism}}

A modern strand of thought sees "nondual consciousness" as a universal psychological state, which is a common stratum and of the same essence in different spiritual traditions.{{sfn|Katz|2007}} It is derived from [[Neo-Vedanta]] and [[neo-Advaita]], but has historical roots in [[neo-Platonism]], [[Western esotericism]], and [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]]. The idea of nondual consciousness as "the central essence"{{sfn|Wolfe|2009|p=iii}} is a [[Universalism|universalistic]] and [[Perennial philosophy|perennialist]] idea, which is part of a modern mutual exchange and synthesis of ideas between western spiritual and [[Western esotericism|esoteric traditions]] and Asian religious revival and reform movements.{{refn|group=note|See McMahan, "The making of Buddhist modernity"{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and [[Richard E. King]], "Orientalism and Religion"{{sfn|King|2002}} for descriptions of this mutual exchange.}}

Central elements in the western traditions are [[Neo-Platonism]], which had a strong influence on [[Christian contemplation]] c.q. [[Christian mysticism|mysticism]], and it's accompanying [[apophatic theology]]; and [[Western esotericism]], which also incorporated Neo-Platonism and [[Gnosticism|Gnostic elements]] including [[Hermeticism]]. Western traditions are, among others, the idea of a [[Perennial Philosophy]], [[Swedenborgianism]], [[Unitarianism]], [[Orientalism]], [[Transcendentalism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], and [[New Age]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996}}

Eastern movements are the [[Hindu reform movements]] such as [[Swami Vivekananda|Vivekananda's]] [[Neo-Vedanta]] and [[Shri Aurobindo|Aurobindo's]] Integral Yoga, the [[Vipassana movement]], and [[Buddhist modernism]].{{refn|group=note|The awareness of historical precedents seems to be lacking in nonduality-adherents, just as the subjective perception of [[Parallelomania|parallels]] between a wide variety of religious traditions lacks a rigorous philosophical or theoretical underpinning.}}

====Christian contemplation and mysticism====
[[File:Mystic m.jpg|thumb|right|The Mystic Marriage of St Catherine, St John the Baptist, St Antony Abbot]]
{{Main article|Christian contemplation|Christian Mysticism|Apophatic theology}}
{{See also|Henosis}}

In Christian mysticism, [[contemplative prayer]] and [[Apophatic theology]] are central elements. In contemplative prayer, the mind is focused by constant repetition a phrase or word. Saint [[John Cassian]] recommended use of the phrase "O God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/350810.htm John Cassian, ''Conferences'', 10, chapters 10-11]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Freeman&gt;[http://www.meditatio.ca/Transcripts/Meditatio%20Talks%20Series%20D%202005.pdf Laurence Freeman 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; Another formula for repetition is the name of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iE45LzrfZuwC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=repetition+of+the+name+of+Jesus&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 Nicholas Cabasilas, ''The Life in Christ'' (St Vladimir's Seminary Press 19740-913836-12-5), p. 32]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xXRMGv9UfBEC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=repetition+of+the+name+of+Jesus&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3 James W. Skehan, ''Place Me with Your Son'' (Georgetown University Press 1991] {{ISBN|0-87840-525-9}}), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Jesus Prayer]], which has been called "the mantra of the Orthodox Church",&lt;ref name=Freeman/&gt; although the term "Jesus Prayer" is not found in the Fathers of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.00.en.some_underlying_positions_of_this_website.htm John S. Romanides, ''Some Underlying Positions of This Website'', 11, note]&lt;/ref&gt; The author of ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'' recommended use of a monosyllabic word, such as "God" or "Love".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VFBg1J0MQ84C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=%22Cloud+of+Unknowing%22+monosyllabic&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 ''The Cloud of Unknowing'' (Wordsworth Classics of World Literature 2005] {{ISBN|1-84022-126-7}}), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Apophatic theology is derived from [[Neo-Platonism]] via [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]]. In this approach, the notion of God is stripped from all positive qualifications, leaving a "darkness" or "unground." It had a strong influence on western mysticism. A notable example is [[Meister Eckhart]], who also attracted attention from Zen-Buddhists like [[D.T. Suzuki]] in modern times, due to the similarities between Buddhist thought and Neo-Platonism.

[[The Cloud of Unknowing]] – an anonymous work of [[Christian mysticism]] written in [[Middle English]] in the latter half of the 14th century – advocates a mystic relationship with God. The text describes a [[spirtuality|spiritual]] union with God through the heart. The author of the text advocates [[centering prayer]], a form of inner silence. According to the text, God can not be known through knowledge or from intellection. It is only by emptying the mind of all created images and thoughts that we can arrive to experience God. Continuing on this line of thought, God is completely unknowable by the mind. God is not known through the intellect but through intense [[contemplation]], motivated by love, and stripped of all thought.&lt;ref&gt;Paul de Jaegher, Donald Attwater ''Christian Mystics of the Middle Ages: An Anthology of Writings'' 2004, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomism]], though not non-dual in the ordinary sense, considers the unity of God so absolute that even the duality of [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]], to describe him, can be true only by [[analogy]]. In Thomist thought, even the [[Tetragrammaton]] is only an approximate name, since "I am" involves a predicate whose own essence is its subject.&lt;ref&gt;Koren, Henry J (1955). ''An Introduction to the Science of Metaphysics''. B. Herder Book Co. {{ISBN|1258017857}}, {{ISBN|978-1258017859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former nun and contemplative [[Bernadette Roberts]] is considered a nondualist by Jerry Katz.{{sfn|Katz|2007}}

====Jewish Hasidism and Kabbalism====
{{Main article|Judaism|Hasidism|Kabbalah}}

According to [[Jay Michaelson]], nonduality begins to appear in the medieval Jewish textual tradition which peaked in [[Hasidism]].&lt;ref name="Michaelson, Jay 2009 p.130"/&gt; According to Michaelson:
{{quote|''Judaism'' has within it a strong and very ancient mystical tradition that is deeply nondualistic. "[[Ein Sof]]"  or infinite nothingness is considered the ground face of all that is. God is considered beyond all proposition or preconception. The physical world is seen as emanating from the nothingness as the many faces "partsufim" of god that are all a part of the sacred nothingness.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, Jay (2009). ''Everything Is God: The Radical Path of Nondual Judaism.'' Shambhala Publications. {{ISBN|1-59030-671-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59030-671-0}}.

One of the most striking contributions of the Kabbalah, which became a central idea in Chasidic thought, was a highly innovative reading of the monotheistic idea. The belief in "one G-d" is no longer perceived as the mere rejection of other deities or intermediaries, but a denial of any existence outside of G-d.{{refn|group=note|As Rabbi Moshe Cordovero explains: "Before anything was emanated, there was only the Infinite One (Ein Sof), which was all that existed. And even after He brought into being everything which exists, there is nothing but Him, and you cannot find anything that existed apart from Him, G-d forbid. For nothing existed devoid of G-d's power, for if there were, He would be limited and subject to duality, G-d forbid. Rather, G-d is everything that exists, but everything that exists is not G-d... Nothing is devoid of His G-dliness: everything is within it... There is nothing but it" (Rabbi Moshe Cordovero, ''Elimah Rabasi'', p. 24d-25a; for sources in early Chasidism see: Rabbi Ya'akov Yosef of Polonne, ''Ben Poras Yosef'' (Piotrków 1884), pp. 140, 168; ''Keser Shem Tov'' (Brooklyn: Kehos 2004) pp. 237-8; Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk, ''Pri Ha-Aretz'', (Kopust 1884), p. 21.).

====Neoplatonism in Islam====
{{Main|Platonism in Islam}}

===Western esotericism===
{{Main|Western esotericism}}

Western esotericism (also called esotericism and esoterism) is a scholarly term for a wide range of loosely related ideas and movements which have developed within [[Western society]]. They are largely distinct both from orthodox [[Judeo-Christian|Judeo-Christian religion]] and from [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[rationalism]]. The earliest traditions which later analysis would label as forms of Western esotericism emerged in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] during [[Late Antiquity]], where [[Hermetism]], [[Gnosticism]], and [[Neoplatonism]] developed as schools of thought distinct from what became mainstream Christianity. In [[Renaissance]] Europe, interest in many of these older ideas increased, with various intellectuals seeking to combine "[[pagan]]" philosophies with the [[Kabbalah]] and with Christian philosophy, resulting in the emergence of esoteric movements like [[Christian theosophy]].

====Perennial philosophy====
{{Main article|Perennial philosophy}}

The Perennial philosophy has its roots in the Renaissance interest in [[neo-Platonism]] and its [[Theory of Forms|idea]] of [[Neo-Platonism#The One|The One]], from which all existence emanates. [[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433–1499) sought to integrate ''[[Corpus Hermeticum|Hermeticism]]'' with Greek and Jewish-Christian thought,{{sfn|Slavenburg|Glaudemans|1994|p=395}} discerning a [[Prisca theologia]] which could be found in all ages.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=508}} [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] (1463–94) suggested that truth could be found in many, rather than just two, traditions. He proposed a harmony between the thought of Plato and Aristotle, and saw aspects of the ''Prisca theologia'' in [[Averroes]], the [[Koran]], the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]] and other sources.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=513}} [[Agostino Steuco]] (1497–1548) coined the term ''philosophia perennis''.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966}}

====Orientalism====
{{Main article|Orientalism}}

The western world has been exposed to Indian religions since the late 18th century.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=176}} The first western translation of a Sanskrit text was made in 1785.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=176}} It marked a growing interest in Indian culture and languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=177}} The first translation of the dualism and nondualism discussing Upanishads appeared in two parts in 1801 and 1802{{sfn|Renard|2010|pp=177-184}} and influenced [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], who called them "the consolation of my life".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=178}} Early translations also appeared in other European languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=183-184}}

====Transcendentalism and Unitarian Universalism====
{{Main article|Transcendentalism}}

Transcendentalism was an early 19th-century [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Protestant]] movement that developed in the 1830s and 1840s in the Eastern region of the [[United States]]. It was rooted in English and German [[Romanticism]], the Biblical criticism of [[Herder]] and [[Schleiermacher]], and the [[skepticism]] of [[David Hume|Hume]].&lt;ref group=web name="Stanford"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/transcendentalism/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''Transcendentalism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Transcendentalists emphasised an intuitive, experiential approach of religion.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis"&gt;[http://www.transcendentalists.com/what.htm Jone John Lewis, ''What is Transcendentalism?"]&lt;/ref&gt; Following Schleiermacher,{{sfn|Sharf|1995}} an individual's intuition of truth was taken as the criterion for truth.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis" /&gt; In the late 18th and early 19th century, the first translations of [[Hindu]] texts appeared, which were read by the Transcendentalists and influenced their thinking.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis" /&gt; The Transcendentalists also endorsed [[Universalism|universalist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarianist]] ideas, leading to [[Unitarian Universalism]], the idea that there must be truth in other religions as well, since a loving God would redeem all living beings, not just Christians.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis" /&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="Andrews"&gt;[http://archive.uua.org/re/other/andrews.html Barry Andrews, ''THE ROOTS OF UNITARIAN UNIVERSALIST SPIRITUALITY IN NEW ENGLAND TRANSCENDENTALISM ''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054734/http://archive.uua.org/re/other/andrews.html |date=21 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the transcendentalists' core beliefs was the inherent goodness of both people and nature. Transcendentalists believed that society and its institutions&amp;mdash;particularly organized religion and political parties&amp;mdash;ultimately corrupted the purity of the individual. They had faith that people are at their best when truly "self-reliant" and independent. It is only from such real individuals that true community could be formed.

The major figures in the movement were [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[John Muir]], [[Margaret Fuller]] and [[Amos Bronson Alcott]].

====Neo-Vedanta====
Unitarian Universalism had a strong impact on Ram Mohan Roy and the Brahmo Samaj, and subsequently on Swami Vivekananda. Vivekananda was one of the main representatives of [[Neo-Vedanta]], a modern interpretation of Hinduism in line with [[Western esotericism|western esoteric traditions]], especially [[Transcendentalism]], [[New Thought]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005}} His reinterpretation was, and is, very successful, creating a new understanding and appreciation of Hinduism within and outside India,{{sfn|Michelis|2005}} and was the principal reason for the enthusiastic reception of yoga, transcendental meditation and other forms of Indian spiritual self-improvement in the West.{{Sfn|Dutta|2003|p=110}}

Narendranath Datta (Swami Vivekananda) became a member of a [[Freemasonry]] lodge "at some point before 1884"{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=100}} and of the [[Sadharan Brahmo Samaj]] in his twenties, a breakaway faction of the [[Brahmo Samaj]] led by [[Keshab Chandra Sen]] and [[Debendranath Tagore]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=99}} Ram Mohan Roy (1772-1833), the founder of the Brahmo Samaj, had a strong sympathy for the Unitarians,{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=3}} who were closely connected to the [[Transcendentalists]], who in turn were interested in and influenced by Indian religions early on.{{sfn|Versluis|1993}} It was in this [[cult]]ic{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=31-35}} milieu that Narendra became acquainted with Western [[esotericism]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=19-90, 97-100}} [[Debendranath Tagore]] brought this "neo-Hinduism" closer in line with western [[esotericism]], a development which was furthered by Keshubchandra Sen,{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=47}} who was also influenced by [[transcendentalism]], which emphasised personal [[religious experience]] over mere reasoning and theology.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=81}} Sen's influence brought Vivekananda fully into contact with western esotericism, and it was also via Sen that he met Ramakrishna.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=50}}

Vivekananda's acquaintance with western esotericism made him very successful in western esoteric circles, beginning with his speech in 1893 at the Parliament of Religions. Vivekananda adapted traditional Hindu ideas and religiosity to suit the needs and understandings of his western audiences, who were especially attracted by and familiar with western esoteric traditions and movements like [[Transcendentalism]] and [[New thought]].{{sfn|Michelis|2004|p=119-123}}

In 1897 he founded the [[Ramakrishna Mission]], which was instrumental in the spread of Neo-Vedanta in the west, and attracted people like Alan Watts. Aldous Huxley, author of ''[[The Perennial Philosophy (book)|The Perennial Philosophy]]'', was associated with another neo-Vedanta organisation, the [[Vedanta Society of Southern California]], founded and headed by [[Swami Prabhavananda]]. Together with [[Gerald Heard]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], and other followers he was initiated by the Swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices.{{sfn|Roy|2003}}

====Theosophical Society====
{{Main article|Theosophical Society}}
A major force in the mutual influence of eastern and western ideas and religiosity was the [[Theosophical Society]].{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=185–188}}{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} It searched for ancient wisdom in the east, spreading eastern religious ideas in the west.{{sfn|Lavoie|2012}} One of its salient features was the belief in [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom (Theosophy)|"Masters of Wisdom"]],{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Ascended Master Teachings]]}} "beings, human or once human, who have transcended the normal frontiers of knowledge, and who make their wisdom available to others".{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}} The Theosophical Society also spread western ideas in the east, aiding a modernisation of eastern traditions, and contributing to a growing nationalism in the Asian colonies.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{refn|group=note|The Theosophical Society had a major influence on [[Buddhist modernism]]{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and [[Hindu reform movements]],{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} and the spread of those modernised versions in the west.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} The [[Theosophical Society]] and the [[Arya Samaj]] were united from 1878 to 1882, as the [[Theosophical Society of the Arya Samaj]].{{sfn|Johnson|1994|p=107}} Along with [[Henry Steel Olcott|H.

====New Age====
{{Main article|New Age}}

The ''New Age movement'' is a [[Western culture|Western]] [[spirituality|spiritual]] movement that developed in the second half of the 20th century. Its central precepts have been described as "drawing on both Eastern and Western spiritual and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] traditions and infusing them with influences from [[self-help]] and motivational [[psychology]], [[holistic health]], [[parapsychology]], consciousness research and [[quantum physics]]".{{sfn|Drury|2004| p=12}}
The New Age aims to create "a spirituality without borders or confining dogmas" that is inclusive and [[religious pluralism|pluralistic]].{{sfn|Drury|2004| p=8}} It holds to "a holistic worldview",{{sfn|Drury|2004| p=11}} emphasising that the [[dialectical monism|Mind, Body and Spirit]] are interrelated&lt;ref name="JGMelton"&gt;Melton, J.

==Scholarly debates==

===Nondual consciousness and mystical experience===
{{Main article|Religious experience|Mystical experience|Altered states of consciousness|Ego-death}}

Insight (''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajna]]'', ''[[kensho]]'', ''[[satori]]'', ''[[gnosis]]'', ''[[theoria]]'', ''[[Divine illumination|illumination]]''), especially ''[[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]'' or the realization of the illusory nature of the autonomous "I" or self, is a key element in modern western nondual thought. It is the personal realization that ultimate reality is nondual, and is thought to be a validating means of knowledge of this nondual reality. This insight is interpreted as a psychological state, and labeled as religious or mystical experience.

====Development====
According to Hori, the notion of "religious experience" can be traced back to [[William James]], who used the term "religious experience" in his book, ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}} The origins of the use of this term can be dated further back.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}

In the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, several historical figures put forth very influential views that religion and its beliefs can be grounded in experience itself. While [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] held that [[Moral obligation|moral experience]] justified [[religious belief]]s, [[John Wesley]] in addition to stressing individual moral exertion thought that the religious experiences in the [[Methodist movement]] (paralleling the [[Romantic Movement]]) were foundational to religious commitment as a way of life.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Issues in Science and Religion]]'', [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, page 68, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of "religious experience" to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of "religious experience" was used by Schleiermacher and [[Albrecht Ritschl|Albert Ritschl]] to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique, and defend the view that human (moral and religious) experience justifies [[religious belief]]s.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}

Such religious empiricism would be later seen as highly problematic and was&amp;nbsp;– during the period in-between world wars&amp;nbsp;– famously rejected by [[Karl Barth]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Issues in Science and Religion]]'', [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, page 114, 116–119&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, religious as well as moral experience as justification for religious beliefs still holds sway. Some influential modern scholars holding this [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theological]] view are [[Charles E. Raven|Charles Raven]] and the Oxford physicist/theologian [[Charles Coulson]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Issues in Science and Religion]]'', [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, p. 126–127&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of "religious experience" was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p=271}}{{refn|group=note|James also gives descriptions of conversion experiences. The Christian model of dramatic conversions, based on the role-model of Paul's conversion, may also have served as a model for Western interpretations and expectations regarding "enlightenment", similar to Protestant influences on Theravada Buddhism, as described by Carrithers: "It rests upon the notion of the primacy of religious experiences, preferably spectacular ones, as the origin and legitimation of religious action. But this presupposition has a natural home, not in Buddhism, but in Christian and especially Protestant Christian movements which prescribe a radical conversion."{{sfn|Carrithers|1983|p=18}} See Sekida for an example of this influence of William James and Christian conversion stories, mentioning Luther{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=196–197}} and St. Paul.{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=251}} See also McMahan for the influence of Christian thought on Buddhism.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}}}

====Criticism====
The notion of "experience" has been criticised.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a}}{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282-286}}{{sfn|Low|2006|p=12}} Robert Sharf points out that "experience" is a typical Western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a}}{{refn|group=note|Robert Sharf: "[T]he role of experience in the history of Buddhism has been greatly exaggerated in contemporary scholarship. Both historical and ethnographic evidence suggests that the privileging of experience may well be traced to certain twentieth-century reform movements, notably those that urge a return to ''[[zazen]]'' or ''[[vipassana]]'' meditation, and these reforms were profoundly influenced by religious developments in the west [...] While some adepts may indeed experience "altered states" in the course of their training, critical analysis shows that such states do not constitute the reference point for the elaborate Buddhist discourse pertaining to the "path".{{sfn|Sharf|1995b|p=1}}}}

Insight is not the "experience" of some transcendental reality, but is a cognitive event, the (intuitive) understanding or "grasping" of some specific understanding of reality, as in [[kensho]]{{sfn|Hori|2000}} or [[anubhava]].{{sfn|Comans|1993}}

"Pure experience" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282}}{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80-82}} A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by "cleaning the doors of perception",{{refn|group=note|[[William Blake]]: "If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thru' narrow chinks of his cavern."&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/2653 Quote DB]&lt;/ref&gt;}} would be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=284}}

A main modern proponent of perennialism was [[Aldous Huxley]], who was influenced by [[Swami Vivekananda|Vivekanda's]] [[Neo-Vedanta]] and [[Universalism]].{{sfn|Roy|2003}} This popular approach finds supports in the "common-core thesis". According to the "common-core thesis",{{sfn|Spilka e.a.|2003|p=321–325}} different descriptions can mask quite similar if not identical experiences:{{sfn|Spilka e.a.|2003|p=321}}

According to Elias Amidon there is an "indescribable, but definitely recognizable, reality that is the ground of all being."{{sfn|Amidon|2012|p=4}} According to Renard, these are based on an experience or intuition of "the Real".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}} According to Amidon, this reality is signified by "many names" from "spiritual traditions throughout the world":{{sfn|Amidon|2012|p=4}}
{{quote|[N]ondual awareness, pure awareness, open awareness, presence-awareness, unconditioned mind, [[rigpa]], primordial experience, This, the basic state, the sublime, [[buddhanature]], original nature, [[Sahaja|spontaneous presence]], the oneness of being, the ground of being, the Real, clarity, God-consciousness, divine light, the clear light, illumination, realization and enlightenment.{{sfn|Amidon|2012|p=4}}}}

According to Renard, nondualism as common essence prefers the term "nondualism", instead of [[monism]], because this understanding is "nonconceptual", "not graspapable in an idea".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}}{{refn|group=note|In Dutch: "Niet in een denkbeeld te vatten".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}}}} Even to call this "ground of reality", "One", or "Oneness" is attributing a characteristic to that ground of reality. [[Apophasis|The only thing that can be said]] is that it is "not two" or "non-dual":&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.swamij.com/pdf/nondualism-paper-101105.pdf Swami Jnaneshvara, ''Faces of Nondualism'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Anderson|2009|p=xvi}} According to Renard, Alan Watts has been one of the main contributors to the popularisation of the non-monistic understanding of "nondualism".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}}{{refn|group=note|According to Renard, Alan Watts has explained the difference between "non-dualism" and "monism" in ''The Supreme Identity'', Faber and Faber 1950, p.69 and 95; ''The Way of Zen'', Pelican-edition 1976, p.59-60.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59, p.285 note 17}}}}

====Criticism====
The "common-core thesis" is criticised by "diversity theorists" such as S.T Katz and W. Proudfoot.{{sfn|Spilka e.a.|2003|p=321}} They argue that 
{{quote|[N]o unmediated experience is possible, and that in the extreme, language is not simply used to interpret experience but in fact constitutes experience.{{sfn|Spilka e.a.|2003|p=321}}}}

The idea of a common essence has been questioned by Yandell, who discerns various "religious experiences" and their corresponding doctrinal settings, which differ in structure and phenomenological content, and in the "evidential value" they present.{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=19–23}} Yandell discerns five sorts:{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=23–31}}
# [[Numinous]] experiences – [[Monotheism]] (Jewish, Christian, Vedantic){{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=24–26}}
# [[Nirvana|Nirvanic]] experiences – [[Buddhism]],{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=24–25, 26–27}} "according to which one sees that the self is but [[Anatta|a bundle of fleeting states]]"{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=24–25}}
# [[Kevala Jnana|Kevala]] experiences{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=30}} – [[Jainism]],{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=25}} "according to which one sees the self as an indestructible subject of experience"{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=25}}
# [[Moksha]] experiences{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=29}} – Hinduism,{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=25}} Brahman "either as a cosmic person, or, quite differently, as qualityless"{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=25}}
# Nature mystical experience{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=30}}

The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may determine what "experience" someone has, which means that this "experience" is not the ''proof'' of the teaching, but a ''result'' of the teaching.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}} The notion of what exactly constitutes "liberating insight" varies between the various traditions, and even within the traditions. Bronkhorst for example notices that the conception of what exactly "liberating insight" is in Buddhism was developed over time. Whereas originally it may not have been specified, later on the Four Truths served as such, to be superseded by ''pratityasamutpada'', and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the non-existence of a substantial self or person.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=100-101}} And Schmithausen notices that still other descriptions of this "liberating insight" exist in the Buddhist canon.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=101}}

'''Pancha Bhoota''' or '''Pancha Maha-Bhoota''' ({{lang-sa|पञ्चभूत}}, {{lang|sa|पञ्चमहाभूत}}), five great elements, also five physical elements, is a group of five basic elements, which, according to [[Hinduism]], 
is the basis of all cosmic creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 79|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; These elements are: '''[[Prithvi]]/[[Bhudevi]]''' (Hindi: पृथ्वी, [[Earth]]), '''[[Ap (water)|Apas]]/[[Varuna]]/[[Jal]]{{dn|date=May 2018}}''' (Hindi: अप्, [[Water]]), '''[[Agni]]''' (Hindi: अग्नि, [[Fire]]), '''[[Vayu]]''' (Hindi: वायु, [[Air]]), '''[[Aakash]]/[[Dyaus]]''' (Hindi: आकाश, [[aether (classical element)|Aether]]). These elements have different characteristics and these also account for different faculties of human experience. In ''[[ayurveda]]'' and Indian philosophy, the human body is considered to be made of these five elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Venkatesan|first1=Satish|title=Ayurvedic remedies: An introduction|isbn=978-9881224149|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vVfGAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT46&amp;dq=panch+bhoota#v=onepage&amp;q=panch%20bhoota&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 March 2015|date=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Cārvāka]] did not accept ''Akash'' as basic element as it is not tangible and according to him, there are only four basic elements.&lt;ref name=BDR&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prasad Sinha|first1=Harendra|title=Bharatiya Darshan Ki Rooprekha|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publisher|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wCAqc1G8sKcC&amp;pg=PT103&amp;dq=%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%9A+%E0%A4%AD%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%A4#v=onepage&amp;q=%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%9A%20%E0%A4%AD%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%A4&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 March 2015|isbn=9788120821446|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism]] also accepts four basic elements and ''Akash'' is left out. These five elements of Indian cosmological system are similar but not identical to five element theory used in East Asia.&lt;ref name=Mudra&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carroll|first1=Cain|title=Mudras of India|isbn=978-1848191099|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gEwSBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=panch+bhoota#v=onepage&amp;q=panch%20bhoota&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 March 2015|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ayurveda==
According to [[ayurveda]] and [[Yoga]], ''Pancha Bhoota'' are associated with overall health of human being. Any disorder in human body indicates imbalance of one or more of these elements. ''Yoga Tattva Mudra Vijnana'' relates these five elements to five fingers of human being. Different ''Mudra'' were developed to balance these&lt;ref&gt;Five Elements [http://gyanpro.com/blog/panchabhutas-5-elements-of-life-with-reference-to-vedic-text-and-illuminati/"]&lt;/ref&gt; in human body which form the ''Hasta Mudra'' in yogic tradition and are used in [[Naturopathy]].

The three ''dosha''- three intrinsic tendencies, which, according to [[ayurveda]] are intrinsic in every human being, are representation of combination of these five elements in human body. The three ''Dosha'' have subtle positive essences which control the mind and body function.&lt;ref name=IS&gt;{{cite web|title=PANCHA BHOOTAS OR THE FIVE ELEMENTS|url=http://www.indianscriptures.com/vedic-lifestyle/beginners-guide/pancha-bhootas-or-the-five-elements|website=http://www.indianscriptures.com/|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yogic View==
According to ''[[Yoga]]'', the aim of ''sadhana'' is to have mastery over oneself. This mastery can be achieved by mastering all the basic elements. The process of gaining mastery over these elements and purifying them is called ''Bhuta Shuddhi''.
''[[Pancha Bhoota Stalam]]'' is representation of ''pancha bhoota'' for yogic practice. People used to move from one temple
to another and do ''sadhana'' on particular basic element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=pancha-bhutas-the-possibility-of-the-five-elements|url=http://www.ishafoundation.org/blog/sadhguru/masters-words/pancha-bhutas-the-possibility-of-the-five-elements/|website=http://www.ishafoundation.org|accessdate=18 March 2015|date=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven ''[[Chakra]]'' in human body are associated with these five elements.&lt;ref name=IS /&gt;

==Hasta Mudras==
{{Further|List of mudras (yoga)}}

''Hasta Mudra'' or hand posture is based on the ''panch bhootas''. The basic assumption is that all the five elements can be represented by five different fingers in human body as shown in the table below.&lt;ref name=BH&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharma|first1=Shiv|title=Brilliance of Hinduism|isbn=978-8128800825|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uajPVNSwYOUC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=fingers+and+associated+element+hinduism#v=onepage&amp;q=fingers%20and%20associated%20element%20hinduism&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 April 2015|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-

|-
|''Angustha'', Thumb|| ''Agni'' 
|}

==Vastu==
{{Further|Vastu shastra}}

[[Vastu shastra]] emphasizes on the placement of five elements in specified direction and the balance of these elements determines the condition of the associated structure.&lt;ref name=IS /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!''Bhoota'' !! Associated Direction || Characteristics 
|-
|''Akasha/Dyaus'' || East || Expansion, enhancement 
|-
|''Vayu/Pavan'' || North || Movements, joy, happiness 
|-
|''Agni'' || South || Power, confidence, fame
|-
|''Jal/Apas/Varuna'' || West || Spirituality, ideas, thoughts, healing 
|-
|''Prithvi/Bhumi'' ||  Center, Diagonal  || Stability, peace and harmony
|}

That is why, in an ideal home, the home itself is placed so that maximum load and weight is in the southwest area of the plot. Thus, there is maximum open space in the North, Northeast and East side of the plot (satisfying Vayu / Air and Akasha / Space)

The entrance to the plot (Main Gate), the Verandah (visitors lounge), and the Main Door is in the Northeast, for the cosmic benefits of Akasha and the purifying benefits of fresh air enter the house in abundance.

To the south of the Verandah is the Living Room, and to its south is 1 or 2 bedrooms (with / without bathrooms)

To the south or southwest of the room is the storeroom (for benefits of Prithvi / Bhumi), and in the Southeast corner of the home is the Kitchen (for here is the perfect balance of Akash (Space) and Agni (Fire)

To the south of the Kitchen is the backyard (but care should be taken to ensure there is NO DOOR in the south to the backyard, it will lead to loss of Vasthu energy)

To the west of the kitchen should be the Master bedroom (and care should be taken to ensure that bathroom IS NOT in the Southwest corner of the room)

To the north of the master bedroom will be the pooja room, and to its north will be a utility area / common bathroom or staircase room to the first floor etc

==Taste==
Combination of pancha bhoota is associated with six human tastes as below.&lt;ref name=IS /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8611">'''Postmodern theology'''—also known as the '''continental philosophy of religion'''—is a philosophical and theological movement that interprets [[theology]] in light of post-[[Martin Heidegger|Heideggerian]] [[continental philosophy]], including [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[post-structuralism]], and [[deconstruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Postmodern Theology: A Biopic|last = Raschke|first = Carl|publisher = |year = 2017|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Postmodern theology emerged in the 1980s and 1990s when a handful of philosophers who took philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] as a common point of departure began publishing influential books on [[theology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Radical Political Theology|last = Crockett|first = Clayton|publisher = |year = 2011|isbn = |location = |pages = 163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more notable works of the era include [[Jean-Luc Marion]]'s 1982 book ''God Without Being'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = God Without Being|last = Marion|first = Jean-Luc|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 1995|isbn = |location = Chicago|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark C. Taylor]]'s 1984 book ''Erring'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Erring: A Postmodern A/Theology|last = Taylor|first = Mark|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 1987|isbn = |location = Chicago|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Winquist]]'s 1994 book ''Desiring Theology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Desiring Theology|last = Winquist|first = Charles|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 1994|isbn = |location = Chicago|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John D. Caputo]]'s 1997 book ''The Prayers and Tears of Jacques Derrida'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Prayers and Tears of Jacques Derrida|last = Caputo|first = John D.|publisher = Indiana University Press|year = 1997|isbn = |location = Bloomington, IN|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Carl Raschke]]'s 2000 book ''The End of Theology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The End of Theology|last = Raschke|first = Carl|publisher = The Davies Group|year = 2000|isbn = |location = Denver CO|edition = 2nd edition.  Originally published in 1979.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

There are at least two branches of postmodern theology, each of which has evolved around the ideas of particular post-[[Martin Heidegger|Heideggerian]] [[continental philosophy|continental philosophers]].  Those branches are '''radical orthodoxy''' and '''weak theology'''. 

===Radical orthodoxy===
{{Main article|Radical orthodoxy}}
Radical orthodoxy is a branch of postmodern theology that has been influenced by the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[Jean-Luc Marion]], [[Paul Ricœur]], and [[Michel Henry]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Deconstructing Radical Orthodoxy|last = Hankey|first = Wayne|publisher = Routledge|year = 2017|isbn = |location = |edition = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Although radical orthodoxy is informally organized, its proponents often agree on a handful of propositions. First, there is no sharp distinction between reason on the one hand and faith or revelation on the other. In addition, the world is best understood through interactions with God, even though a full understanding of God is never possible. Those interactions include culture, language, history, technology, and theology. Further, God directs people toward truth, which is never fully available to them. In fact, a full appreciation of the physical world is only possible through a belief in transcendence. Finally, salvation is found through interactions with God and others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unifr.ch/theo/assets/files/SA2015/Theses_EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent advocates of radical orthodoxy include [[John Milbank]], [[Catherine Pickstock]], and [[Graham Ward (theologian)|Graham Ward]].

===Weak theology===
Weak theology is a branch of postmodern theology that has been influenced by the [[Deconstruction|deconstructive]] thought of [[Jacques Derrida]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Weakness of God|last = Caputo|first = John D.|publisher = Indiana University Press|year = 2006|isbn = |location = 12|edition = }}&lt;/ref&gt; including Derrida's description of a moral experience he calls "the weak force."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Weakness of God|last = Caputo|first = John D.|publisher = Indiana University Press|year = 2006|isbn = |location = 7|edition = }}; {{Cite book|title = Rogues|last = Derrida|first = Jacques|publisher = Stanford University Press|year = 2005|isbn = |location = |edition = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weak theology rejects the idea that God is an overwhelming physical or [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] force. Instead, God is an unconditional claim without any force whatsoever. As a claim without force, the God of weak theology does not intervene in nature. As a result, weak theology emphasizes the responsibility of humans to act in this world here and now.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = After the Death of God|last = Caputo, John D.|first = Vattimo, Gianni|publisher = Columbia University Press|year = 2007|isbn = |location = 64-65|edition = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John D. Caputo]] is a prominent advocate of the movement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4703">:''This article deals with predictive power in the context of the philosophy of science. For a statistical measure of predictive power, see [[mean squared prediction error]].''

[[Image:Einstein theory triumphs.png|right|thumb|150px|''[[The New York Times]]'' of November 10, 1919, reported on Einstein's confirmed prediction of [[gravitation]] on space, called the [[gravitational lens]] effect.]]

The concept of '''predictive power''' differs from [[explanatory power|explanatory]] and [[descriptive power]] (where phenomena that are already known are retrospectively explained or described by a given theory) in that it allows a prospective test of theoretical understanding.

==Examples==
A classic example of the predictive power of a theory is the [[discovery of Neptune]] as a result of predictions made by mathematicians [[John Couch Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier]], based on Newton's theory of gravity.

Another example of the predictive power of theories or models is [[Dmitri Mendeleev]]'s use of his [[periodic table]] to predict previously undiscovered [[chemical element]]s and their properties. Though largely correct, he misjudged the relative atomic masses of [[tellurium]] and [[iodine]].

Moreover, [[Charles Darwin]] used his knowledge of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] to predict that since a plant (''[[Angraecum sesquipedale]]'') with a long spur in its flowers exists, a complementary animal with a 30&amp;nbsp;cm [[proboscis]] must also exist to feed on and [[pollination|pollinate]] it. Twenty years after his death, a form of [[hawk moth]] (''[[Xanthopan]] morganii'') that did just that was found.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Another example of predictive power is the prediction of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] that the path of light would bend in the presence of a strong gravitational field. This was [[Tests of general relativity#Deflection of light by the Sun|experimentally verified]] by an expedition to [[Sobral, Ceará|Sobral]] in [[Brazil]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] island of [[Príncipe]] to measure star positions during the solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, when observations made by the astrophysicist [[Arthur Eddington]] seemed to confirm Einstein's predictions.&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Dyson, A. S. Eddington, and C. Davidson, "A Determination of the Deflection of Light by the Sun's Gravitational Field, from Observations Made at the Total Eclipse of May 29, 1919," ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series A,'' Volume 220 (1920) pp. 291-333 (available [http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/content/l30l04qu5m012r87/ online from the Royal Society]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt; Although the measurements have been criticized by some as utilizing flawed methodology,&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Collins]] and [[Trevor Pinch]], ''The Golem: What Everyone Should Know About Science,'' Cambridge University Press, 1993. ({{ISBN|0521477360}})&lt;/ref&gt; modern reanalysis of the data&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kennefick, "Not Only Because of Theory: Dyson, Eddington and the Competing Myths of the 1919 Eclipse Expedition," ''Proceedings of the 7th Conference on the History of General Relativity'', Tenerife, 2005; available [http://xxx.arxiv.org/abs/0709.0685 online from ArXiv]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Ball, "Arthur Eddington Was Innocent," ''Nature,'' 7 September 2007, {{doi|10.1038/news070903-20}} (available [http://philipball.blogspot.com/2007/09/arthur-eddington-was-innocent-this-is.html online] 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that Eddington's analysis of the data was accurate. Later, more precise measurements taken by [[radio astronomy|radio]] [[interferometry]] confirmed the predictions to a high degree of accuracy.

== Applications ==
The predictive power of a theory is closely related to applications. {{according to whom|date=April 2013}}

General relativity not only predicts the bending of light, but also predicts several other phenomena. Recently, the calculation of [[proper time]] of [[satellite]]s has been a successfully-measured prediction, now incorporated into the method used to calculate positions via [[GPS]].

If a theory has no predictive power, it cannot be used for applications.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The '''Mimamsa Sutra''' ({{lang-sa|मीमांसा सूत्र}}, {{IAST|Mīmāṁsā Sūtra}}) or the '''Purva Mimamsa Sutras''' (ca. 500-400 BC&lt;ref name=hiriyanna&gt;{{cite book|last=Hiriyanna|first=M.|title=The Essentials of Indian Philosophy|year=1995|publisher=Motilal Banrasidass|location=Delhi|isbn=81-208-1330-8|pages=130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QeRIP-TuKLAC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=mimamsa+sutra+twelve+chapters&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OUc5TeHeI4WnrAfZiOn0CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;), written by [[Rishi]] [[Jaimini]] is one of the most important ancient Hindu philosophical texts. It forms the basis of [[Mimamsa]], the earliest of the six orthodox schools ([[darshanas]]) of [[Indian philosophy]]. According  to tradition, sage Jaimini was one of the disciples of sage [[Veda Vyasa]], the author of Mahabharata.

==Overview==
The work is divided into twelve ''adhyaya''s (chapters), which are further divided into sixty ''padas'' (sections).&lt;ref name=hiriyanna/&gt;

The text provides rules for the interpretation of the Vedas and also provides philosophical justifications for the observance of Vedic rituals, by offering meaning and significance of Vedic rituals to attain Moksha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/ebene_1/fiindolo/gretil/1_sanskr/6_sastra/3_phil/mimamsa/jaimsutu.htm Jaimini: Mimamsasutra at Sansknet project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609165015/http://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/ebene_1/fiindolo/gretil/1_sanskr/6_sastra/3_phil/mimamsa/jaimsutu.htm |date=2007-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentaries==
Over the centuries many commentaries were written on this text, most important being the ''Śabara Bhāṣya'' written by [[Śābara]], the only extant commentary on all the 12 chapters of the Mimamsa Sutras of Jaimini.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinfo.org/Project.asp?ProjectId=2 Shabara Bhashya at Chinmaya Mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040713015220/http://chinfo.org/Project.asp?ProjectId=2 |date=2004-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The  major commentaries written on the text as well as the ''Śabara Bhāṣya'' were by [[Kumarila Bhatta]] and [[Prabhākara|Prabhakara Mishra]].

==Philosophy==
Jaimini, in his ''Mimamsa Sutra'', presents material activity and its results as the whole of reality (vipanam rtam). He and later proponents of [[Karma-mimamsa]] philosophy teach that material existence is endless, that there is no liberation. For Mimamsas, the cycle of [[karma]] is perpetual, and the best one can aim for is higher birth among the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s. Therefore, they hold that the whole purpose of the [[Vedas]] is to engage human beings in rituals for creating good karma, and consequently the mature soul's prime responsibility is to ascertain the exact meaning of the Vedas' sacrificial injunctions and to execute them.

A '''relative clause''' is a kind of [[subordinate clause]] that contains the element whose interpretation is provided by an [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] on which the subordinate clause is grammatically [[dependent (grammar)|dependent]]; that is, there is an [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]] relation between the relativized element in the relative clause and antecedent on which it depends.&lt;ref name="HP183"&gt;Rodney D. Huddleston, Geoffrey K. Pullum, ''A Student's Introduction to English Grammar'', CUP 2005, p. 183ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, a relative clause modifies a [[noun]] or [[noun phrase]],&lt;ref name="HP183" /&gt; and uses some grammatical device to indicate that one of the arguments within the relative clause has the same referent as that noun or noun phrase. For example, in the sentence ''I met a man who wasn't there'', the subordinate clause ''who wasn't there'' is a relative clause, since it modifies the noun ''man'', and uses the pronoun ''who'' to indicate that the same "man" is referred to within the subordinate clause (in this case, as its [[subject (grammar)|subject]]).

In many European languages, relative clauses are introduced by a special class of [[pronoun]]s called ''[[relative pronoun]]s'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurzová |first=Helena |year=1981 |language=German |title=Der Relativsatz in den indoeuropäischen Sprachen |trans-title=Relative Clauses in the Indo-European Languages |series= |location=Hamburg |publisher=Buske |page=117 |isbn=3-87118-458-6 |oclc=63317519}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''who'' in the example just given. In other languages, relative clauses may be marked in different ways: they may be introduced by a special class of conjunctions called ''[[relativizer]]s''; the main verb of the relative clause may appear in a special morphological variant; or a relative clause may be indicated by word order alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lehmann |first=Christian |year=1984 |language=German |title= Der Relativsatz |trans-title=Relative Clauses |series=Language universals series; vol. 3 |location=Tübingen |publisher=G. Narr |page=438 |isbn=3-87808-982-1 |oclc=14358164}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some languages, more than one of these mechanisms may be possible.

==Types==

===Bound and free===
A '''bound relative clause''', the type most often considered, qualifies an explicit element (usually a [[noun]] or [[noun phrase]]) appearing in the main clause, and refers back to that element by means of some explicit or implicit device within the relative clause.

The relative clause may also function as an ''embedded clause'' within a main (or higher-level) clause, thereby forming a ''matrix sentence''. &lt;ref name="Glossary of Linguistic Terms "&gt;Matrix Sentence, ''http://www.glossary.sil.org/term/matrix-sentencer''&lt;/ref&gt; The noun in the main clause that the relative clause modifies is called the ''[[Head (grammar)|head]] noun'', or (particularly when referred back to by a relative pronoun) the ''[[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]]''.

For example, in the English sentence "The man whom I saw yesterday went home", the relative clause "whom I saw yesterday" modifies the head noun ''man'', and the relative pronoun ''whom'' refers back to the referent of that noun. The sentence is equivalent to the following two sentences: "I saw a man yesterday. The man went home." Note that the shared argument need not fulfill the same role in both clauses; in this example the same man is referred to by the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the matrix clause, but the [[direct object]] of the relative clause.

A '''free relative clause''', on the other hand, does not have an explicit antecedent external to itself. Instead, the relative clause itself takes the place of an argument in the matrix clause. For example, in the English sentence "I like what I see", the clause ''what I see'' is a free relative clause, because it has no antecedent, but itself serves as the [[object (grammar)|object]] of the verb ''like'' in the main clause. (An alternative analysis is that the free relative clause has [[zero (linguistics)|zero]] as its antecedent.)

===Restrictive and non-restrictive===
Bound relative clauses may or may not be [[restrictive]]. Whereas a '''non-restrictive''' or '''non-defining''' relative clause merely provides supplementary information, a '''restrictive''' or '''defining''' relative clause modifies the meaning of its head word (restricts its possible referent).  For example:
*''The man '''who lives in this house''' has not been seen for days.'' This (''who lives in this house'') is a restrictive relative clause, modifying the meaning of ''man'', and essential to the sentence (if the clause were omitted, it would no longer be known which man is being referred to). If the bold part is deleted the remaining part does not provide the sense.
*''The mayor, '''who lives in this house''', has not been seen for days.'' This is a non-restrictive relative clause, since it provides supplementary information about the mayor, but is not essential to the sentence – if the clause were omitted, it would still be known which mayor is meant.  If the bold part is deleted the remaining part provides the sense.

In speaking it is natural to make slight pauses around non-restrictive clauses, and in English this is shown in writing by [[comma]]s (as in the examples). However many languages do not distinguish the two types of relative clause in this way. Another difference in English is that only restrictive relative clauses may be introduced with ''that'' or use the "zero" relative pronoun (see [[English relative clauses]] for details).

In colloquial speech, a non-restrictive relative clause may have a whole sentence as its antecedent rather than a specific noun phrase; for example:
*''The cat was allowed on the bed, '''which annoyed the dog'''.''
Here, the context of the sentence (presumably) indicates that ''which'' refers not to the bed or the cat but to the entire [[proposition]] expressed in the main clause, namely the circumstance that the cat was allowed on the bed. Such constructions are discouraged in formal usage and in texts written for nonnative speakers because of the potential for ambiguity in parsing; a construction more accepted in formal usage would be ''The cat's being ''[or ''having been''] ''allowed on the bed annoyed the dog.''

===Finite and non-finite===
Relative clauses may be either finite clauses (as in the examples above) or [[non-finite clause]]s. An example of a non-finite relative clause in English is the [[infinitive clause]] ''on whom to rely'', in the sentence "She is the person on whom to rely".

==Formation methods==
Languages differ in many ways in how relative clauses are expressed:
#How the role of the shared noun phrase is indicated in the embedded clause.
#How the two clauses are joined together.
#Where the embedded clause is placed relative to the head noun (in the process indicating which noun phrase in the main clause is modified).

For example, the English sentence "The man that I saw yesterday went home" can be described as follows:
#The role of the shared noun in the embedded clause is indicated by ''gapping''; that is, a gap is left in the object position after "saw", implying that the shared noun phrase ("the man") is to be understood to fill that gap and to serve as the object of the verb "saw".
#The clauses are joined by the ''complementizer'' "that".
#The embedded clause is placed ''after'' the head noun "the man".

The following sentences indicate various possibilities (only some of which are grammatical in English):
*"The man [that I saw yesterday] went home". (A ''complementizer'' linking the two clauses with a ''gapping'' strategy indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause. One possibility in English. Very common cross-linguistically.)
*"The man [I saw yesterday] went home". (Gapping strategy, with no word joining the clauses&amp;mdash;also known as a [[reduced relative clause]]. One possibility in English. Used in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] when the head noun is [[definiteness|indefinite]], as in "a man" instead of "the man".)
*"The man [whom I saw yesterday] went home". (A [[relative pronoun]] indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause—in this case, the direct object. Used in formal English, as in [[Latin]], [[German language|German]] or [[Russian language|Russian]].)
*"The man [seen by me yesterday] went home". (A [[reduced relative clause]], in this case [[passive voice|passivized]]. One possibility in English.)
*"The man [that I saw him yesterday] went home". (A complementizer linking the two sentences with a [[resumptive pronoun]] indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause, as in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Persian language|Persian]].)
*"The man [that him I saw yesterday] went home". (Similar to the previous, but with the resumptive pronoun fronted. This occurs in modern [[Greek language|Greek]] and as one possibility in modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; the combination ''that him'' of complementizer and resumptive pronoun behaves similar to a unitary relative pronoun.)
*"The [I saw yesterday]'s man went home". (Preceding relative clause with gapping and use of a possessive particle—as normally used in a [[genitive construction]]—to link the relative clause to the head noun. This occurs in many Sino-Tibetan languages and possibly developed from "relative clause + noun" &gt; "nominalized clause + noun" &gt; "genitive construction".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ling.sinica.edu.tw/files/publication/j2008_4_03_2641.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ling.sinica.edu.tw/files/publication/j2008_4_05_5653.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;)
*"The [I saw yesterday] man went home". (Preceding relative clause with gapping and no linking word, as in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].)
*"The man [of my seeing yesterday] went home". ([[Nominalization|Nominalized]] relative clause, as in [[Turkish language|Turkish]].)
*"[Which man I saw yesterday], that man went home". (A ''correlative'' structure, as in [[Hindi]].)
*"[I saw the man yesterday] went home." (An ''unreduced, internally headed'' relative clause, as in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] or [[Navajo language|Navajo]].)

===Strategies for indicating the role of the shared noun in the relative clause===
There are four main strategies for indicating the role of the shared noun phrase in the embedded clause. These are typically listed in order of the degree to which the noun in the relative clause has been reduced, from most to least:

# Gap strategy or gapped relative clause
# Relative pronoun
# Pronoun retention
# Nonreduction

====Gapped relative clause====
In this strategy, there is simply a gap in the relative clause where the shared noun would go. This is normal in English, for example, and also in Chinese and Japanese. This is the most common type of relative clause, especially in [[subject–object–verb|verb-final]] languages with prenominal relative clauses, but is also widespread among languages with postnominal externally headed relative clauses.

There may or may not be any marker used to join the relative and main clauses. (Note that languages with a case-marked relative pronoun are technically not considered to employ the gapping strategy even though they do in fact have a gap, since the case of the relative pronoun indicates the role of the shared noun.) Often the form of the verb is different from that in main clauses and is to some degree nominalized, as in Turkish and in English [[reduced relative clause]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Carrol | first=David W | edition=5 | title=Psychology of Language | publisher=Thomson &amp; Wadsworth | location=Belmont | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Townsend | first=David J |author2=Thomas G Bever  | title=Sentence Comprehension: The Integration of Habits and Rules | year=2001 | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge | pages=247&amp;ndash;9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In non-verb-final languages, apart from languages like [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] with very strong politeness distinctions in their grammars{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}, gapped relative clauses tend, however, to be restricted to positions high up in the accessibility hierarchy. With obliques and genitives, non-verb-final languages that do not have politeness restrictions on pronoun use tend to use pronoun retention. English is unusual in that ''all'' roles in the embedded clause can be indicated by gapping: e.g. "I saw the man who is my friend", but also (in progressively less accessible positions cross-linguistically, according to the ''[[accessibility hierarchy]]'' described below) "...&amp;nbsp;who I know", "...&amp;nbsp;who I gave a book to", "...&amp;nbsp;who I spoke with", "...&amp;nbsp;who I run slower than". Usually, languages with gapping disallow it beyond a certain level in the accessibility hierarchy, and switch to a different strategy at this point.  [[Classical Arabic]], for example, only allows gapping in the subject and sometimes the direct object; beyond that, a resumptive pronoun must be used. Some languages have no allowed strategies at all past a certain point—e.g. in many [[Austronesian languages]], such as [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], all relative clauses must have the shared noun serving the subject role in the embedded clause. In these languages, relative clauses with shared nouns serving "disallowed" roles can be expressed by [[passive voice|passivizing]] the embedded sentence, thereby moving the noun in the embedded sentence into the subject position. This, for example, would transform "The man who I gave a book to" into "The man who was given a book by me". Generally, languages such as this "conspire" to implement general relativization by allowing passivization from ''all'' positions — hence a sentence equivalent to "The man who is run slower than by me" is grammatical. Note also that gapping is often used in conjunction with case-marked relative pronouns (since the relative pronoun indicates the case role in the embedded clause), but this is not necessary (e.g. Chinese and Japanese both using gapping in conjunction with an indeclinable complementizer).

====Relative pronoun type====
This is in fact a type of gapped relative clause, but is distinguished by the fact that the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause is indicated indirectly by the case marking of the marker (the [[relative pronoun]]) used to join the main and embedded clauses. All languages which use relative pronouns have them in clause-initial position: though one could conceivably imagine a clause-final relative pronoun analogous to an adverbial subordinator in that position, they are unknown.

Note that some languages have what are described as "relative pronouns" (in that they agree with some properties of the head noun, such as number and gender) but which do not actually indicate the case role of the shared noun in the embedded clause.  [[Classical Arabic]] in fact has "relative pronouns" which are case-marked, but which agree in case with the ''head'' noun. Case-marked relative pronouns in the strict sense are almost entirely confined to [[Standard Average European|European languages]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}, where they are widespread except among the [[Celtic languages|Celtic family]] and [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan family]]. The influence of Spanish has led to their adaption by a very small number of [[indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]], of which the best-known are the [[Keresan languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_aco|title=WALS Online - Language Acoma|author=|date=|website=wals.info|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pronoun retention type====
In this type, the position relativized is indicated by means of a [[personal pronoun]] in the same syntactic position as would ordinarily be occupied by a noun phrase of that type in the main clause—known as a ''[[resumptive pronoun]]''. It is equivalent to saying "The man who I saw &lt;u&gt;him&lt;/u&gt; yesterday went home". Pronoun retention is very frequently used for relativization of inaccessible positions on the accessibility hierarchy. In [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Classical Arabic]], for example, resumptive pronouns are required when the embedded role is other than the subject or direct object, and optional in the case of the direct object. Resumptive pronouns are common in non-verb-final [[languages of Africa]] and Asia, and also used by the Celtic languages of northwest Europe and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ("Omul pe care &lt;u&gt;l&lt;/u&gt;-am văzut ieri a mers acasă"/"The man who I saw &lt;u&gt;him&lt;/u&gt; yesterday went home"). They also occur in deeply embedded positions in English, as in "That's the girl that I don't know what &lt;u&gt;she&lt;/u&gt; did",&lt;ref name="mckee"&gt;{{citation|title=Resumptive Pronouns in English Relative Clauses|first1=Cecile|last1=McKee|first2=Dana|last2=McDaniel|journal=Language Acquisition|volume=9|number=2|year=2001|pages=113–156|doi=10.1207/s15327817la0902_01}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although this is sometimes considered non-standard.

Only a very small number of languages, of which the best known is [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], have pronoun retention as their sole grammatical type of relative clause.

====Nonreduction type====
In the nonreduction type, unlike the other three, the shared noun occurs as a ''full-fledged noun phrase'' in the embedded clause, which has the form of a full independent clause. Typically, it is the head noun in the main clause that is reduced or missing. Some languages use relative clauses of this type with the normal strategy of embedding the relative clause next to the head noun. These languages are said to have ''internally headed'' relative clauses, which would be similar to the (ungrammatical) English structure "[You see the girl over there] is my friend" or "I took [you see the girl over there] out on a date". This is used, for example, in [[Navajo language|Navajo]], which uses a special relative verb (as with some other Native American languages).

A second strategy is the ''correlative''-clause strategy used by [[Hindi]] and other [[Indo-Aryan languages]], as well as [[Bambara language|Bambara]]. This strategy is equivalent to saying "Which girl you see over there, she is my daughter" or "Which knife I killed my friend with, the police found that knife". It is "correlative" because of the corresponding "which ... that ..." demonstratives or "which ... she/he/it ..." pronouns, which indicate the respective nouns being equated. Note that the shared noun can either be repeated entirely in the main clause or reduced to a pronoun. Note also that there is no need to front the shared noun in such a sentence. For example, in the second example above, Hindi would actually say something equivalent to "I killed my friend with which knife, the police found that knife".

Dialects of some European languages, such as Italian, do use the nonreduction type in forms that could be glossed in English as "The man just passed us by, he introduced me to the chancellor here."

In general, however, nonreduction is restricted to verb-final languages, though it is more common among those that are [[head-marking language|head-marking]].

===Strategies for joining the relative clause to the main clause===
The following are some of the common strategies for joining the two clauses:
*Use of an indeclinable particle (specifically, a [[relativizer]]) inserted into the sentence, placed next to the modified noun; the embedded clause is likewise inserted into the appropriate position, typically placed on the other side of the complementizer. This strategy is very common and arguably occurs in English with the word ''that'' ("the man that I saw"), though this interpretation of "that" as something other than a relative pronoun is controversial (see  [[#English|below]]). In the modern [[varieties of Arabic]] (using ''illi'' placed after the modified noun); in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (using ''de'' placed before the modified noun).
*Use of a [[relative pronoun]]. Prototypically, a relative pronoun agrees with the head noun in gender, number, definiteness, animacy, etc., but adopts the [[grammatical case|case]] that the shared noun assumes in the ''embedded'', not matrix, clause. This is the case in a number of conservative European languages, such as [[Latin]], [[German language|German]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Many languages also have similar linking words commonly termed "relative pronouns" that agree in some way with the head noun, but do not adopt the case role of the embedded clause. In English, for example, the use of ''who'' vs. ''which'' agrees with the animacy of the head noun, but there is no case agreement except in the formal English contrast ''who'' vs. ''whom'' (which is often used incorrectly, if at all, in speech). Similarly, in [[Classical Arabic]], there is a relative pronoun that agrees in number, gender, [[definiteness]] ''and'' case with the head noun (rather than taking the case role of the noun in the embedded clause). Languages with prototypical relative pronouns typically use the gapping strategy for indicating the role in the embedded clause, since the relative pronoun itself indicates the role by its case. ([[Classical Arabic]], where the case marking indicates something else, uses a [[resumptive pronoun]].) Some linguists prefer to use the term ''relative pronoun'' only for the prototypical cases (but in this case it's unclear what to call the non-prototypical cases).
*Directly inserting the embedded clause in the matrix clause at the appropriate position, with no word used to join them. This is common, for example, in English (cf. "The man I saw yesterday went home"), and is used in [[Classical Arabic]] in relative clauses that modify indefinite nouns.
*By [[nominalization|nominalizing]] the relative clause (e.g. converting it to a participial construction). Generally, no relative pronoun or complementizer is used. This occurs, for example, in [[reduced relative clause]]s in English (e.g. "The man seen by me yesterday went home" or "The man planning to go home soon is my friend"). Formal German makes common use of such participial relative clauses, which can become extremely long. This is also the normal strategy in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], which has sentences equivalent to "I ate the potato of Hasan's giving to Sina" (in place of "I ate the potato that Hasan gave to Sina"). Note that this can be viewed as a situation in which the "complementizer" is attached to the verb of the embedded clause (e.g. in English, "-ing" or "-ed" can be viewed as a type of complementizer).

===Position of the head noun with respect to the relative clause===
The positioning of a relative clause before or after a head noun is related to the more general concept of [[Branching (linguistics)|branching]] in linguistics. Languages that place relative clauses after their head noun (so-called ''head-initial'' or ''VO'' languages) generally also have adjectives and [[genitive construction|genitive modifier]]s following the head noun, as well as verbs preceding their objects.  [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are prototypical languages of this sort. Languages that place relative clauses before their head noun (so-called ''head-final'' or ''OV'' languages) generally also have adjectives and [[genitive construction|genitive modifier]]s preceding the head noun, as well as verbs following their objects. [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] are prototypical languages of this sort. Not all languages fit so easily into these categories. English, for example, is generally head-first, but has adjectives preceding their head nouns, and [[genitive construction]]s with both preceding and following modifiers ("the friend of my father" vs. "my father's friend").  [[Chinese language|Chinese]] has the ''VO'' order, with verb preceding object, but otherwise is generally head-final.

Various possibilities for ordering are:
*Relative clause following the head noun, as in English, [[French language|French]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]].
*Relative clause preceding the head noun, as in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], or [[Chinese language|Chinese]].
*Head noun ''within'' the relative clause (an ''internally headed'' relative clause). An example of such a language is [[Navajo language|Navajo]]. These languages are said to have [[#Nonreduction type|nonreduced]] relative clauses. These languages have a structure equivalent to "[I saw the man yesterday] went home".
*Adjoined relative clause. These languages have the relative clause completely outside the main clause, and use a correlative structure to link the two. These languages also have [[#Nonreduction type|nonreduced]] relative clauses. [[Hindi]] is the most well known such language, and have a structure similar to "Which man I saw yesterday, that man went home" or (with non-fronting of the relativized noun in the relative clause) "I saw which man yesterday, that man went home". Another example is [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]], which constructs relative clauses of a form similar to "I saw the man yesterday, which he was going home". However, it is sometimes said these languages have no relative clauses at all, since the sentences of this form can equally well translate as  "I saw the man who was going home yesterday" or "I saw the man yesterday when/while he was going home".

==Accessibility hierarchy==
The antecedent of the relative clause (that is, the noun that is modified by it) can in theory be the subject of the main clause, or its object, or any other [[verb argument]]. In many languages, however, especially rigidly [[left-branching]], [[dependent-marking language]]s with prenominal relative clauses,&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Christian (1986). On the typology of relative clauses. ''Linguistics'', 24(4), 663-680. {{doi|10.1515/ling.1986.24.4.663}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are major restrictions on the role the antecedent may have ''in the relative clause''.

[[Edward Keenan]] and [[Bernard Comrie]] noted that these roles can be ranked cross-linguistically in the following order from most accessible to least accessible:&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, Edward L. &amp; Comrie, Bernard (1977). Noun phrase accessibility and Universal Grammar, [[Linguistic Inquiry]], 8(1), 63-99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Comrie, Bernard; ''Language Universals and Linguistic Typology''; pp. 156-163; {{ISBN|0-226-11434-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Subject  &gt; Direct Object  &gt; Indirect Object  &gt; Oblique  &gt; Genitive  &gt; Object of comparative

[[Ergative–absolutive]] languages have a similar hierarchy:

:[[Absolutive case|Absolutive]] &gt; [[Ergative case|Ergative]] &gt; Indirect Object &gt; etc. (same as above)

This order is called the '''accessibility hierarchy'''. If a language can relativize positions lower in the accessibility hierarchy, it can always relativize positions higher up, but not vice versa. For example, [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] can relativize only subject and [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]] only absolutive arguments, whilst [[Basque language|Basque]] can relativize absolutives, ergatives and indirect objects, but not obliques or genitives or objects of comparatives. Similar hierarchies have been proposed in other circumstances, e.g. for pronominal reflexes.

[[English language|English]] can relativize all positions in the hierarchy. Here are some examples of the NP and relative clause usage from English:

!Position !! With explicit relative pronoun !! With omitted relative pronoun !! In formal English
|-
|[[subject (grammar)|Subject]] || That’s the man [who ran away].                  || — || That’s the man [who ran away].
|-
|[[Direct object]] || That’s the man [who I saw yesterday].         || That's the man [I saw yesterday]. || That’s the man [whom I saw yesterday].
|-
|[[Indirect object]] || That’s the man [who I gave the letter to]. || That’s the man [I gave the letter to]. || That’s the man [to whom I gave the letter]. 
|-
|[[oblique case|Oblique]] || That’s the man [who I was talking about].  || That’s the man [I was talking about]. || That’s the man [about whom I was talking]. 
|-
|[[Genitive]] || That’s the man [whose sister I know].	       || — ||  That’s the man [whose sister I know].
|-
|Obj of Comp || That’s the man [who I am taller than].		       || That’s the man [I am taller than]. || That’s the man [than whom I am taller].
|}

Some other examples:

{| align="center"
!Position !! Example
|-
|[[subject (grammar)|Subject]] || The girl [who came late] is my sister.
|-
|[[Direct object]]  || I gave a rose to the girl [that Kate saw].
|-
|[[Indirect object]] || John knows the girl [I wrote a letter to].
|-
|[[oblique case|Oblique]] || I found the rock [which the robbers had hit John over the head with].
|-
|[[Genitive]] || The girl [whose father died] told me she was sad.
|-
|Obj of Comp || The first person [I can't run faster than] will win a million dollars.
|}

Languages that cannot relativize directly on noun phrases low in the accessibility hierarchy can sometimes use alternative [[grammatical voice|voices]] to "raise" the relevant noun phrase so that it can be relativized. The most common example is the use of [[applicative voice]]s to relativize obliques, but in such languages as Chukchi [[antipassive voice|antipassives]] are used to raise ergative arguments to absolutive.

For example, a language that can relativize only subjects could say this:
*The girl [who likes me] came to visit.
But not:
**The girl [whom I like] came to visit.
**The girl [whom I gave a rose to] came to visit.
**The girl [whom I watched a movie with] came to visit.
**The girl [whose father I know] came to visit.
**The girl [whom I know the father of] came to visit. (''equivalent to previous'')
**The girl [whom I am taller than] came to visit.
These languages might form an equivalent sentence by [[passive voice|passivization]]:
*The girl [who was liked by me] came to visit.
*The girl [who was given a rose by me] came to visit.
*The girl [who was watched a movie with by me] came to visit.
*The girl [who was known the father of by me] came to visit.
*The girl [who was been taller than by me] came to visit.
Note that these passivized sentences get progressively more ungrammatical in English as they move down the accessibility hierarchy; the last two, in particular, are so ungrammatical as to be almost unparsable by English speakers. But languages with severe restrictions on which roles can be relativized are precisely those that can passivize almost any position, and hence the last two sentences would be normal in those languages.

A further example is languages that can relativize only subjects and direct objects. Hence the following would be possible:
*The girl [who I like] came to visit.
The other ungrammatical examples above would still be ungrammatical. These languages often allow an oblique object to be moved to the direct object slot by the use of the so-called ''[[applicative voice]]'', much as the [[passive voice]] moves an oblique object to the subject position. The above examples expressed in an applicative voice might be similar to the following (in not necessarily grammatical English):
*The girl [who I gave a rose] came to visit.
*The girl [who I with-watched a movie] came to visit.
*The girl [who I (of-)know the father] came to visit.
*The girl [who I out-tall] came to visit.

Modern grammars may use the accessibility hierarchy to order productions—e.g. in [[Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar]] the hierarchy corresponds to the order of elements on the ''subcat'' list, and interacts with other principles in explanations of binding facts. The hierarchy also figures in
[[Lexical Functional Grammar]], where it is known as Syntactic Rank or the Relational Hierarchy.

{{main|English relative clauses}}
In English, a relative clause follows the noun it modifies. It is generally indicated by a relative pronoun at the start of the clause, although sometimes simply by word order. If the relative pronoun is the object of the verb in the relative clause, it comes at the beginning of the clause even though it would come at the end of an independent clause ("He is the man ''whom'' I saw", not "He is the man I saw ''whom''").

The choice of relative pronoun can be affected by whether the clause modifies a human or non-human noun, by whether the clause is restrictive or not,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |editor1-last=Suprun |editor1-first=Adam E |deadurl=no |editor2-last=Jachnow |editor2-first=Helmut |title=Slavjano-germanskie jazykovye paralleli/Slawisch-germanische Sprachparallelen |series=Sovmestnyj issledovatel'skij sbornik slavistov universitetov v Minske i Bochume |publisher=Belorusskij gosudarstvennyj universitet |page=165 |language=German |chapter=Pronomina im Antezendenten und Restriktivität/Nicht-Restriktivität von Relativsätzen im Kroatoserbischen und Deutschen |trans-chapter=Pronouns in antecedents and restrictive / non-restrictive relative clauses in Serbo-Croatian and German |chapterurl=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/426662.PRONOMINA_IM_ANTEZEDENT.PDF |location=Minsk |year=1996 |oclc=637166830 |archivedate=29 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AHPw0DET |accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the role (subject, direct object, or the like) of the relative pronoun in the relative clause.

*For a human antecedent, "who", "whom", or "that" is usually used ("He is the person ''who'' saw me", "He is the person ''whom'' I saw", "He is the person ''that'' I saw"). For a non-human antecedent, only "that" or "which" is used.
*For a non-human antecedent in a non-restrictive clause, only "which" is used ("The tree, ''which'' fell, is over there"); while either "which" or "that" may be used in a restrictive clause ("The tree ''which'' fell is over there", "The tree ''that'' fell is over there"){{mdash}}but some styles and prescriptive grammars require the use of "that" in the restrictive context.
*Of the relative pronoun pair "who" and "whom", the ''subjective'' case form ("who") is used if it is the subject of the relative clause ("He is the policeman who saw me"); and, in formal usage, the ''objective'' case form ("whom") if it is the object of the verb or preposition in the relative clause ("He is the policeman whom I saw", "He is the policeman whom I talked to", "He is the policeman to whom I talked"); but in informal usage "whom" is often replaced by "who".

In English, as in some other languages (such as French; see below), [[restrictiveness|non-restrictive]] relative clauses are set off with commas, but restrictive ones are not:

*"I met a man and a woman yesterday. The woman, ''who had a thick French accent'', was very pretty." (non-restrictive—does not narrow down who is being talked about)
*"I met two women yesterday, one with a thick French accent and one with a mild Italian one. The woman ''who had the thick French accent'' was very pretty." (restrictive—adds information about who is being referred to)

The status of "that" as a relative pronoun is not universally agreed. Traditional grammars treat "that" as a relative pronoun, but not all contemporary grammars do: e.g. the [[Cambridge Grammar of the English Language]] (pp.&amp;nbsp;1056–7) makes a case for treating "that" as a subordinator instead of a relative pronoun; and the [[British National Corpus]] treats "that" as a subordinating conjunction even when it introduces relative clauses. One motivation for the different treatment of "that" is that there are differences between "that" and "which" (e.g., one can say "in which" but not "in that", etc.).

====French====
The system of relative pronouns in [[French language|French]] is as complicated as, but similar in many ways to, the system in English.

When the pronoun is to act as the direct object of the relative clause, ''{{lang|fr|que}}'' is generally used, although ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'', which is inflected for grammatical gender and number, is sometimes used in order to give more precision. For example, any of the following is correct and would translate to "I talked to his/her father and mother, whom I already knew":

:''{{lang|fr|J'ai parlé avec son père et sa mère, '''laquelle''' (f. sing.) je connaissais déjà.}}''
:''{{lang|fr|J'ai parlé avec son père et sa mère, '''lesquels''' (m. pl.) je connaissais déjà.}}''
:''{{lang|fr|J'ai parlé avec son père et sa mère, '''que''' je connaissais déjà.}}''

However, in the first sentence, "whom I already knew" refers only to the mother; in the second, it refers to both parents; and in the third, as in the English sentence, it could refer either only to the mother, or to both parents.

When the pronoun is to act as the subject of the relative clause, ''{{lang|fr|qui}}'' is generally used, though as before, ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' may be used instead for greater precision. (This is less common than the use of ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' with direct objects, however, since verbs in French often reflect the grammatical number of their subjects.)

Contrary to English, the relative pronoun can never be omitted in French, not even when the relative clause is embedded in another relative clause.
:Here is what I think '''Ø''' happened.
:''{{lang|fr|Voilà ce que je crois '''qui''' est arrivé.}}'' (literally: "Here is what I think '''that''' happened.")

When the pronoun is to act in a possessive sense, where the preposition ''de'' (of/from) would normally be used, the pronoun ''{{lang|fr|dont}}'' ("whose") is used, but does not act as a [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]] for the noun "possessed":

:''{{lang|fr|J'ai parlé avec une femme '''dont''' le fils est mon collègue.}}'' ("I spoke with a woman whose son I work with." - ''lit.'', "I spoke with a woman ''of whom'' the son is my colleague.")

This construction is also used in non-possessive cases where the pronoun replaces an object marked by ''{{lang|fr|de}}'':

:''{{lang|fr|C'est l'homme '''dont''' j'ai parlé.}}'' ("That's the man '''of whom''' I spoke.")

More generally, in modern French, ''{{lang|fr|dont}}'' can signal the topic of the following clause, without replacing anything in this clause:

:''{{lang|fr|C'est un homme '''dont''' je crois qu'il doit très bien gagner sa vie.}}'' ("That's a man '''about whom''' I believe that he must make a lot of money.")

When the pronoun is to act as the object of a preposition (other than when ''{{lang|fr|dont}}'' is used), ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' is generally used, though ''{{lang|fr|qui}}'' can be used if the antecedent is human.

:''{{lang|fr|Ce sont des gens '''sur lesquels''' on peut compter.}}'' ("These are people '''that''' can be depended '''on'''.") [literally: "'''on whom''' one can depend"]
:''{{lang|fr|Ce sont des gens '''sur qui''' on peut compter.}}''

:''{{lang|fr|C'est une table '''sur laquelle''' on peut mettre beaucoup de choses.}}'' ("This is a table '''on which''' you can put a lot of things")
:&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;''C'est une table sur qui on peut mettre beaucoup de choses.''

There exists a further complication when the antecedent is a non-human indefinite pronoun. In that case, ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' cannot be used because it must agree in gender with its head, and an indefinite pronoun has no gender. Instead, ''{{lang|fr|quoi}}'', which usually means "what", is used.
:''{{lang|fr|C'est manifestement &lt;u&gt;quelque chose&lt;/u&gt; '''à quoi''' il a beaucoup réfléchi.}}'' ("This is obviously &lt;u&gt;something&lt;/u&gt; '''that '''he has thought a lot '''about '''.")
:&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;''C'est manifestement quelque chose à laquelle il a beaucoup réfléchi.''

The same happens when the antecedent is an entire clause, also lacking gender.
:''{{lang|fr|Il m'a dit d'aller me faire voir, '''à quoi''' j'ai répondu que...}}'' ("He told me to get lost, '''to which''' I replied that ...")

The preposition always appears before the pronoun, and the prepositions ''{{lang|fr|de}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|à}}'' (at/to) contract with ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' to form ''{{lang|fr|duquel}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|auquel}}'', or with ''{{lang|fr|lesquel(le)s}}'' to form ''{{lang|fr|desquel(le)s}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|auxquel(le)s}}''.

====German====
Aside from their highly inflected forms, [[German language|German]] relative pronouns are less complicated than English. There are two varieties. The more common one is based on the definite article ''der'', ''die'', ''das'', but with distinctive forms in the genitive (''dessen'', ''deren'') and in the dative plural (''denen''). Historically this is related to English ''that''. The second, which is more literary and used for emphasis, is the relative use of ''welcher'', ''welche'', ''welches'', comparable with English ''which''. As in most Germanic languages, including Old English, both of these varieties inflect according to gender, case and number. They take their gender and number from the noun which they modify, but the case from their function in their own clause.

:''Das Haus, in dem ich wohne, ist sehr alt.''
::The house in which I live is very old.

The relative pronoun ''dem'' is neuter singular to agree with ''Haus'', but dative because it follows a preposition in its own clause. On the same basis, it would be possible to substitute the pronoun ''welchem''.

However, German uses the uninflecting ''was'' ('what') as a relative pronoun when the antecedent is ''alles'', ''etwas'' or ''nichts'' ('everything', 'something', 'nothing'.).

:''Alles, was Jack macht, gelingt ihm.''
::Everything that Jack does is a success.

In German, all relative clauses are marked with commas.

Alternatively, particularly in formal registers, participles (both active and passive) can be used to embed relative clauses in adjectival phrases:

:''Die vom ihm in jenem Stil gemalten Bilder sind sehr begehrt''
::The pictures he painted in that style are highly sought after
:''Die Regierung möchte diese im letzten Jahr eher langsam wachsende Industrie weiter födern''
::The government would like to further promote this industry, which has grown rather slowly over the last year

Unlike English, which only permits relatively small participle phrases in adjectival positions (typically just the participle and adverbs), and disallows the use of direct objects for active participles, German sentences of this sort can embed clauses of arbitrary complexity.

====Spanish====
See [[Spanish pronouns#Relative pronouns|Relative pronouns]] in the Spanish pronouns article.

====Latin====
In [[Latin]], relative clauses follow the noun phrases they modify, and are always introduced using relative pronouns. Relative pronouns, like other pronouns in Latin, agree with their antecedents in [[grammatical gender|gender]] and [[grammatical number|number]], but not in [[grammatical case|case]]: a relative pronoun's case reflects its role in the relative clause it introduces, while its antecedent's case reflects the antecedent's role in the clause that contains the relative clause. (Nonetheless, it is possible for the pronoun and antecedent to be in the same case.) For example:

:'''''Urbēs''', '''quae''' sunt magnae, videntur. (''The '''cities''', '''which''' are large, are being seen.'')
:'''''Urbēs''', '''quās''' vīdī, erant magnae.'' (''The '''cities''', '''which''' I saw, were large.'')

In the former example, ''urbēs'' and ''quae'' both function as [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] in their respective clauses, so both are in the nominative case; and due to gender and number agreement, both are feminine and plural. In the latter example, both are still feminine and plural, and ''urbēs'' is still in the nominative case, but ''quae'' has been replaced by ''quās'', its accusative-case counterpart, to reflect its role as the [[direct object]] of ''vīdī''.

For more information on the forms of Latin relative pronouns, ''see'' [[Latin declension#Relative pronouns|the section on relative pronouns in the article on Latin declension]].

====Ancient Greek====
[[Ancient Greek]] follows the same rule as Latin.

*αἱ πόλεις, ἃς εἶδον, μεγάλαι εἰσίν.
:hai póleis, hàs eîdon, megálai eisin.
:The cities that I saw are large.

The Ancient Greek relative pronoun ὅς, ἥ, ὅ (''hós, hē&amp;#769;, hó'') is unrelated to the Latin word, since it derives from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] {{PIE|*yos}}: in [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]], ''y'' before a vowel usually changed to ''h'' ([[debuccalization]]). [[Cognate]]s include [[Sanskrit]] ''yas, yā, yad'' (where ''o'' changed to short ''a'').&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|o(/s1|ὅς|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek definite article ὁ, ἡ, τό (''ho, hē, tó'') has a different origin, since it is related to Sanskrit ''sa, sā'' and [[Latin]] ''is-tud''.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|o(1|ὁ|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information that in English would be encoded with relative clauses could be represented with complex participles in Ancient Greek. This was made particularly expressive by the rich suite of participles available, with active and passive participles in present, past and future tenses. This is called [[Participle_(Ancient_Greek)#The_attributive_participle|the attributive participle]]

====Serbo-Croatian====
[[Serbo-Croatian]] uses exactly the same principle as Latin does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gallis |first=Arne |year=1956 |title=The syntax of relative clauses in Serbo-Croatian: Viewed on a historical basis |location=Oslo |publisher=I Kommisjon Hos H. Aschehoug |page=186 |oclc=601586}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following sentences are the Latin examples translated to Serbo-Croatian (the same sentences apply to the Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin standard variants of the [[pluricentric language]]):

:{||-
| ''Gradovi, '' || '''''koji''''' || ''su'' || ''veliki'', || ''vide'' || ''se''. 
|-
|the cities:&lt;small&gt;NOM.m.PL&lt;/small&gt; || which:&lt;small&gt;NOM.m.PL&lt;/small&gt; || are:&lt;small&gt;PR.3.PL&lt;/small&gt; || large:&lt;small&gt;NOM.m.PL&lt;/small&gt; || see:&lt;small&gt;PR.3.PL&lt;/small&gt; || itself:&lt;small&gt;Refl&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| colspan=6 | "The cities, which are large, are being seen."
|}

:{||-
| ''Gradovi, '' || '''''koje''''' || ''sam'' || ''vidio'', || ''bili'' || ''su'' || ''veliki''.
|-
|the cities:&lt;small&gt;NOM.m.PL&lt;/small&gt; || which:&lt;small&gt;ACC.m.PL&lt;/small&gt; || I am:&lt;small&gt;AUX.1.SG&lt;/small&gt; || saw:&lt;small&gt;AP.m.SG&lt;/small&gt; || were:&lt;small&gt;AP.m.PL &lt;/small&gt; || are:&lt;small&gt;AUX.3.PL&lt;/small&gt; || large:&lt;small&gt;NOM.m.PL&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| colspan=7 | "The cities, which I saw, were large."
|}

In the first sentence, ''koji'' is in the [[nominative]], and in the second ''koje'' is in the [[accusative]]. Both words are two case forms of the same [[relative pronoun]], that is inflicted for [[Grammatical gender|gender]] (here: masculine), [[Grammatical number|number]] (here: plural), and [[Grammatical case|case]].

An alternative relativizing strategy is the use of the non-declinable word ''što'' 'that' to introduce a relative clause.&lt;ref name=KordiGerm&gt;{{cite book|last=Kordić |first=Snježana| authorlink=Snježana Kordić |year=1999 |language=German |title=Der Relativsatz im Serbokroatischen|trans-title=Relative Clauses in Serbo-Croatian |series=Studies in Slavic Linguistics ; vol. 10 |location=Munich |publisher=Lincom Europa |page=330 |isbn=3-89586-573-7 |oclc=42422661 |ol=2863535W}} [http://d-nb.info/956417647/04 Contents]&lt;/ref&gt; This word is used together with a [[resumptive pronoun]], i.e. a [[personal pronoun]] that agrees in gender and number with the [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]], while its case form depends on its function in the relative clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Auwera, Johan van der |author2= Kučanda, Dubravko |title=Pronoun or conjunction - the Serbo-Croatian invariant relativizer ''što'' |journal=Linguistics |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=917–962 |year=1985 |issn=0024-3949}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resumptive pronoun never appears in subject function.

Relative clauses are relatively frequent in modern Serbo-Croatian&lt;ref name=KordiGerm/&gt; since they have expanded as attributes at the expense of the [[participle]]s performing that function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kordić |first=Snježana| authorlink=Snježana Kordić |year=1997 |title=Serbo-Croatian |series=Languages of the World/Materials ; vol. 148 |location=Munich &amp; Newcastle |publisher=Lincom Europa | pages=57–60 |isbn=3-89586-161-8 |oclc=37959860 |ol=2863538W}} [http://bvbr.bib-bvb.de:8991/exlibris/aleph/a21_1/apache_media/I2FGYMHULBDSMDXPPEFDGV9ELUGDN2.pdf Contents]&lt;/ref&gt; The most frequently used relative pronoun is ''koji''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maček |first=Dora| authorlink= |year=1986|title=Relativization in English and Serbo-Croatian |series=The Yugoslav Serbo-Croatian - English contrastive project, New studies; vol. 3 |location=Zagreb | publisher=Institute of Linguistics, Faculty of Philosophy, University of Zagreb |page=91 |oclc=14710495}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several ongoing changes concerning ''koji''.

====Celtic languages====
{{see also|Irish syntax#Relative clauses}}
The [[Celtic languages]] (at least the modern [[Insular Celtic languages]]) distinguish two types of relative clause: direct relative clauses and indirect relative clauses. A direct relative clause is used where the relativized element is the subject or the direct object of its clause (e.g. "the man ''who'' saw me", "the man ''whom'' I saw"), while an indirect relative clause is used where the relativized element is a genitival (e.g. "the man ''whose'' daughter is in the hospital") or is the object of a preposition (e.g. "the man ''to whom'' I gave the book"). Direct relative clauses are formed with a [[relative pronoun]] (unmarked for case) at the beginning; a gap (in terms of syntactic theory, a [[trace (linguistics)|trace]], indicated by (''t)'' in the examples below) is left in the relative clause at the pronoun's expected position.

;Irish
{|
| an || fear || a || chonaic || (''t)'' || mé
|-
| the || man || DIR-REL || saw || || me
|-
| colspan=6 | "the man who saw me"
|}
;Welsh
{|
| y || dyn || a || welais
|-
| the || man || DIR-REL || I saw
|-
| colspan=4 | "the man whom I saw"
|}

The direct relative particle "a" is not used with "mae" ("is") in Welsh; instead the form "sydd" or "sy'" is used:

{|
| y || dyn || sy'n || blewog || iawn
|-
| the || man || DIR-REL + is || hairy || very 
|-
| colspan=5 | "the man who is very hairy"
|}

There is also a defective verb "piau" (usually lenited to "biau"), corresponding to "who own(s)":

{|
| y || dyn || piau || castell || anferth
|-
| the || man || DIR-REL + owns || castle || huge 
|-
| colspan=5 | "the man who owns a huge castle"
|}

Indirect relative clauses are formed with a [[relativizer]] at the beginning; the relativized element remains ''in situ'' in the relative clause.

;Irish
{|
| an || fear || a || bhfuil || a || iníon || san || ospidéal
|-
| the || man || IND-REL || is || his || daughter || in the || hospital
|-
| colspan=8 | "the man whose daughter is in the hospital"
|}
;Welsh
{|
| y || dyn || y || rhois || y || llyfr || iddo
|-
| the || man || IND-REL || I gave || the || book || to him
|-
| colspan=7 | "the man to whom I gave the book"
|}

Note that although both the Irish relative pronoun and the relativizer are 'a', the relative pronoun triggers lenition of a following consonant, while the relativizer triggers eclipsis (see [[Irish initial mutations]]).

Both direct and indirect relative particles can be used simply for emphasis, often in answer to a question or as a way of disagreeing with a statement. For instance, the Welsh example above, "y dyn a welais" means not only "the man whom I saw", but also "it was the man (and not anyone else) I saw"; and "y dyn y rhois y llyfr iddo" can likewise mean "it was the man (and not anyone else) to whom I gave the book".

In [[Biblical Hebrew language|Biblical Hebrew]], relative clauses were headed with the word ''asher'', which could be either a [[relative pronoun]] or a [[relativizer]]. In later times, ''asher'' became interchangeable with the prefix ''she-'' (which is also used as a conjunction, with the sense of English ''that''), and in [[Modern Hebrew language|Modern Hebrew]], this use of ''she-'' is much more common than ''asher'', except in some formal, archaic, or poetic writing. In meaning, the two are interchangeable; they are used regardless of whether the clause is modifying a human, regardless of their grammatical case in the relative clause, and regardless of whether the clause is restrictive.

Further, because Hebrew does not generally use its word for ''is'', ''she-'' is used to distinguish adjective phrases used in epithet from adjective phrases used in attribution:

:''Ha-kise l'-yad-kha.'' ("The chair is next to you." - ''lit.'', "The-chair [is] to-hand-your.")
:''Ha-kise '''she-'''l'-yad-kha shavur.'' ("The chair next to you is broken."—''lit.'', "The-chair '''that'''-[is]-to-hand-your [is] broken.")

(This use of ''she-'' does not occur with simple adjectives, as Hebrew has a different way of making that distinction. For example, ''Ha-kise adom'' means "The chair [is] red," while ''Ha-kis'e ha-adom shavur'' means "The red chair is broken"—literally, "The chair the red [is] broken.")

Since 1994, the official rules of Modern Hebrew (as determined by the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]]) have stated that relative clauses are to be punctuated in Hebrew the same way as in English (described above). That is, non-restrictive clauses are to be set off with commas, while restrictive clauses are not:

:''Ha-kise, '''she-'''ata yoshev alav, shavur.'' ("The chair, '''which''' you are sitting on, is broken.")
:''Ha-kise '''she-'''ata yoshev alav shavur.'' ("The chair '''that''' you are sitting on is broken.")

Nonetheless, many, perhaps most, speakers of Modern Hebrew still use the pre-1994 rules, which were based on the German rules (described above). Except for the simple adjective-phrase clauses described above, these speakers set off all relative clauses, restrictive or not, with commas:

:''Ha-kise, '''she-'''ata yoshev alav, shavur.'' ("The chair '''that''' you are sitting on is broken," ''or'' "The chair, '''which''' you are sitting on, is broken.")

One major difference between relative clauses in Hebrew and those in (for example) English is that in Hebrew, what might be called the "regular" pronoun is not always suppressed in the relative clause. To reuse the prior example:

:''Ha-kise, '''she-'''ata yoshev '''alav''', shavur.'' (''lit.'', "The chair, '''which''' you are sitting '''on it''', [is] broken.")

More specifically, if this pronoun is the subject of the relative clause, it is always suppressed. If it is the direct object, then it is usually suppressed, though it is also correct to leave it in. (If it is suppressed, then the special preposition ''et'', used to mark the direct object, is suppressed as well.) If it is the object of a preposition, it must be left in, because in Hebrew—unlike in English—a preposition cannot appear without its object. When the pronoun is left in, ''she-'' might more properly be called a [[relativizer]] than a relative pronoun.

The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[relativizer]] ''she-'' ‘that’ "might be a shortened form of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[relativizer]] ''‘asher'' ‘that’, which is related to [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''‘ashru'' ‘place’ (cf. Semitic *''‘athar'') Alternatively, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''‘asher'' derived from ''she-'', or it was a convergence of Proto-Semitic ''dhu'' (cf. Aramaic ''dī'') and ''‘asher'' [...] Whereas [[Israeli Hebrew|Israeli]] ''she-'' functions both as [[complementizer]] and [[relativizer]], ''ashér'' can only function as a [[relativizer]]."&lt;ref&gt;A quote from p. 79 of [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2006), "Complement Clause Types in Israeli", ''Complementation: A Cross-Linguistic Typology'', edited by [[R. M. W. Dixon]] and [[Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald]], [[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]], pp. 72-92 (Chapter 3).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arabic====

=====Literary Arabic=====
In [[Modern Standard Arabic|Modern Standard]] and [[Classical Arabic]] there is a relative pronoun (in Arabic: {{lang|ar|الاسم الموصول}} {{transl|ar|DIN|''al-ism al-mawṣūl''}}) ''allaḏī'' (masculine singular), feminine singular ''allatī'', masculine plural ''allaḏīna'', feminine plural ''allawātī'', masculine dual ''allaḏānī'' (nominative) / ''allaḏayni'' (accusative and genitive), feminine dual ''allatānī'' (nom.) / ''allataynī'' (acc. and gen.).

Its usage has two specific rules: it agrees with the antecedent in gender, number and case, and it is used only if the antecedent is definite. If the antecedent is indefinite, no relative pronoun is used. The former is called ''jumlat sila'' (conjunctive sentence) while the latter is called ''jumlat sifa'' (descriptive sentence).

*{{lang|ar|الولد الذي رأيته في الصف أمس غائب اليوم }}
:''al-waladu (a)lladhi ra’aytuhu fī (a)ṣ-ṣaffi ’amsi ġā’ibun al-yawma''
:"The boy I saw in class yesterday is missing today". (relative pronoun present)
*{{lang|ar|هذا ولد رأيته في الصف أمس}}
:''hāḏā waladun ra’aytu-hu fī (a)ṣ-ṣaffi ’amsi''
:"This is a boy I saw in class yesterday". (relative pronoun absent)

=====Colloquial Arabic=====
In Colloquial Arabic the multiple forms of the relative pronoun have been levelled in favour of a single form, a simple conjunction, which in most dialects is ''illi'', and is never omitted. So in Palestinian Arabic the above sentences would be:

* ''alwalad illi shuftō fi (a)ssaff embārih ghāyeb alyōm''
* ''hāda walad illi shuftō fi (a)ssaff embārih''

As in Hebrew, the regular pronoun referring to the antecedent is repeated in the relative clause - literally, "the boy whom I saw '''him''' in class..." (the ''-hu'' in ''ra'aituhu'' and the ''-ō'' in ''shuftō''). The rules of suppression in Arabic are identical to those of Hebrew: obligatory suppression in the case that the pronoun is the subject of the relative clause, obligatory retention in the case that the pronoun is the object of a preposition, and at the discretion of the speaker if the pronoun is the direct object. The only difference from Hebrew is that, in the case of the direct object, it is preferable to retain the pronoun rather than suppress it.

===Japonic languages===

====Japanese====
Japanese does not employ relative pronouns to relate relative clauses to their antecedents. Instead, the relative clause directly modifies the noun phrase as an [[attributive verb]], occupying the same syntactic space as an attributive adjective (before the noun phrase).

:この　おいしい　天ぷら
:''kono oishii tempura''
:"this delicious [[tempura]]"

:姉が　作った　天ぷら
:''ane-ga tsukutta tempura''
:''sister-SUBJ make-PAST tempura''
:"the tempura [that] my sister made"

:天ぷらを　食べた　人
:''tempura-o tabeta hito''
:''tempura-OBJ eat-PAST person''
:"the person who ate the tempura"

In fact, since so-called ''i-adjectives'' in Japanese are technically intransitive stative verbs, it can be argued that the structure of the first example (with an adjective) is the same as the others. A number of "adjectival" meanings, in Japanese, are customarily shown with relative clauses consisting solely of a verb or a verb complex:

:光っている　ビル
:''hikatte-iru biru''
:''lit-be building''
:"an illuminated building"

:濡れている　犬
:''nurete-iru inu''
:''get_wet-be dog''
:"a wet dog"

Often confusing to speakers of languages which use relative pronouns are relative clauses which would in their own languages require a preposition with the pronoun to indicate the semantic relationship among the constituent parts of the phrase.

:紅茶を　淹れる　ために　お湯を　沸かした　やかん
:''kōcha-o ireru tame ni oyu-o wakashita yakan''
:''tea-OBJ make purpose for hot-water-OBJ boiled kettle''
:"the kettle I boiled water '''in''' for tea"

Here, the preposition "in" is missing from the Japanese ("missing" in the sense that the corresponding postposition would be used with the main clause verb in Japanese) Common sense indicates what the meaning is in this case, but the "missing preposition" can sometimes create ambiguity.

:天ぷらを　作った　人
:''tempura-o tsukutta hito''
:''tempura-OBJ made person''
:(1) "the person who made the tempura"
:(2) "the person [someone] made the tempura '''for'''"

In this case, (1) is the context-free interpretation of choice, but (2) is possible with the proper context.

:僕が　記事を　書いた　レストラン
:''boku-ga kiji-o kaita resutoran''
:''I-SUBJ article-OBJ wrote restaurant''
:(1) "a restaurant '''about which''' I wrote an article"
:(2) "a restaurant '''in which''' I wrote an article"

Without more context, both (1) and (2) are equally viable interpretations of the Japanese.

'''Note:''' Spaces are not ordinarily used in Japanese, but they are supplemented here to facilitate parsing by non-speakers of the language.

===Caucasian languages===

====Georgian====
In [[Georgian language|Georgian]], there are two strategies for forming relative clauses. The first is similar to that of English or Latin: the modified noun is followed by a relativizer that inflects for its embedded case and may take a postposition. The relativized noun may be preceded by a determiner.

:{|
| (ის) || კაცი, || რომელიც || პარკში || წავიდა, || გაზეთს || კითხულობს
|-
| ''(is)'' || ''ḳac-i,'' || ''romel-i-c'' || ''ṗarḳ=ši'' || ''c̣avida,'' || ''gazet-s'' || ''ḳitxulobs''
|-
| (that.NOM) || man-NOM || which-NOM-REL || park=to || he.went || newspaper-DAT || he.reads.it
|-
| colspan=7 | "the man who went to the park is reading the newspaper"
|}

:{|
| (ის) || ქალი, || რომელსაც || წერილს || დავუწერ, || თბილისში || ცხოვრობს
|-
| ''(is)'' || ''kal-i,'' || ''romel-sa-c'' || ''c̣eril-s'' || ''davuc̣er,'' || ''tbilis=ši'' || ''cxovrobs''
|-
| (that.NOM) || woman-NOM || which-DAT-REL || letter-DAT || I.will.write.it.to.her || Tbilisi-in || she.lives
|-
| colspan=7 | "the woman who I will write a letter to lives in [[Tbilisi]]"
|}

:{|
| ნინომ || (ის) || სკამი, || რომელზეც || ვზივარ, || იყიდა
|-
| ''Nino-m'' || ''(is)'' || ''sḳam-i,'' || romel=ze-c || vzivar, || ''iqida''
|-
| Nino-ERG || (that.NOM) || chair-NOM || which=on-REL || I.sit || she.bought.it
|-
| colspan=6 | "Nino bought the chair I am sitting in"
|}

A second, more colloquial, strategy is marked by the invariant particle რომ ''rom''. This particle is generally the second word of the clause, and since it does not decline, is often followed by the appropriately cased third-person pronoun to show the relativized noun's role in the embedded clause. A determiner precedes the relativized noun, which is also usually preceded by the clause as a whole.

:{|
| წერილს || რომ || მას || დავუწერ, || ის || ქალი || თბილისში || ცხოვრობს
|-
| ''c̣̣eril-s'' || ''rom'' || ''mas'' || ''davuc̣̣er,'' || ''is'' || ''kal-i'' || ''tbilis=ši'' || ''cxovrobs''
|-
| letter-DAT || REL || 3S.DAT || I.will.write.it.to.her || that.NOM || woman-NOM || Tbilisi-in || she.lives
|-
| colspan=8 | "the woman who I will write a letter to lives in [[Tbilisi]]"
|}

:{|
| მე || რომ || მასზე || ვზივარ, || ის || სკამი || ნინომ || იყიდა
|-
| ''me'' || ''rom'' || ''mas=ze'' || ''vzivar,'' || ''is'' || ''sḳam-i'' || ''Nino-m'' || ''iqida''
|-
| 1S || REL || 3S.DAT=on || I.sit || that.NOM || chair-NOM || Nino-ERG || she.bought.it
|-
| colspan=8 | "Nino bought the chair I am sitting in"
|}

Such relative clauses may be internally headed. In such cases, the modified noun moves into the clause, taking the appropriate declension for the its role therein (thus eliminating the need for the third person pronouns in the above examples), and leaves behind the determiner (which now functions as a pronoun) in the matrix clause.

:{|
| ქალს || რომ || წერილს || დავუწერ, || ის || თბილისში || ცხოვრობს
|-
| ''kal-s'' || ''rom'' || ''c̣̣eril-s'' || ''davuc̣̣er,'' || ''is'' || ''tbilis=ši'' || ''cxovrobs''
|-
| woman-DAT || REL || letter-DAT || I.will.write.it.to.her || 3S.NOM || Tbilisi-in || she.lives
|-
| colspan=7 | "the woman who I will write a letter to lives in [[Tbilisi]]"
|}

===Austronesian languages===

====Tagalog====
[[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] uses the [[Relative clause#Gapped relative clause|gapping strategy]] to form relative clauses, with the [[complementizer|complementiser]], ''na'' / ''=ng'' 'that', separating the head, which is the noun being modified, from the actual relative clause. In (1a) below, ''lalaki'' 'man' serves as the head, while ''nagbigay ng bigas sa bata'' 'gave rice to the child' is the relative clause.

:{|
| (1) || a. || '''lalaki''' || =ng || nagbigay || ____ || ng || bigas || sa || bata
|-
|  ||  || man || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|act}}.gave ||  || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|dat}} || child
|-
|  ||  || colspan=8 | "man that gave rice to the child"
|-
|-
|  || b. || Nagbigay || ''ang'' || ''lalaki'' || ng || bigas || sa || bata.
|-
|  ||  || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|nom}} || man || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|dat}} || child
|-
|  ||  || colspan=8 | "The man gave rice to the child."
|}

The gap inside the relative clause corresponds to the position that the noun acting as the head would have normally taken, had it been in a [[Sentence (linguistics)#By purpose|declarative sentence]]. In (1a), the gap is in subject position within the relative clause. This corresponds to the subject position occupied by ''ang lalaki'' 'the man' in the declarative sentence in (1b).

There is a constraint in Tagalog on the position from which a noun can be relativised and in which a gap can appear: A noun has to be the subject within the relative clause in order for it to be relativised. The phrases in (2) are ungrammatical because the nouns that have been relativised are not the subjects of their respective relative clauses. In (2a), the gap is in direct object position, while in (2b), the gap is in indirect object position.

:{|
| (2) || a. || * || '''bigas''' || na || nagbigay || ang || lalaki || ____ || sa || bata
|-
|  ||  ||  || rice || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|nom}} || man ||  || {{sc|dat}} || child
|-
|  ||  ||  || colspan=8 | for:  "rice that the man gave to the child"
|-
|-
|  || b. || * || '''bata''' || =ng || nagbigay || ang || lalaki || ng || bigas || ____
|-
|  ||  ||  || child || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|nom}} || man || {{sc|acc}} || rice ||
|-
|  ||  ||  || colspan=8 | for:  "child that the man gave rice to"
|}

The correct Tagalog translations for the intended meanings in (2) are found in (3), where the verbs have been passivised in order to raise the logical direct object in (3a) and the logical indirect object in (3b) to subject position.  (Tagalog can have more than one [[Tagalog grammar#Trigger .28voice .2F focus.29|passive voice]] form for any given verb.)

:{|
| (3) || a. || '''bigas''' || na || ibinigay || ng || lalaki || sa || bata
|-
|  ||  || rice || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|psv}}.gave || {{sc|gen}} || man || {{sc|dat}} || child
|-
|  ||  || colspan=7 | "rice that the man gave to the child"
|-
|  ||  || colspan=7 | (or:  "rice that was given to the child by the man")
|-
|  || b. || '''bata''' || =ng || binigyan || ng || lalaki || ng || bigas
|-
|  ||  || child || {{sc|comp}} || gave.{{sc|psv}} || {{sc|gen}} || man || {{sc|acc}} || rice
|-
|  ||  || colspan=7 | "child that the man gave rice to"
|-
|  ||  || colspan=7 | (or:  "child that was given rice to by the man")
|}

Tagalog relative clauses can be left-headed, as in (1a) and (3), right-headed, as in (4), or internally headed, as in (5).

:{|
| (4) || nagbigay || ng || bigas || sa || bata || na || '''lalaki'''
|-
|   || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|dat}} || child || {{sc|comp}} || man
|-
|  || colspan=7 | "man that gave rice to the child"
|}

:{|
| (5) || a. || nagbigay || na || '''lalaki''' || ng || bigas || sa || bata
|-
|   ||  || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|comp}} || man || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|dat}} || child
|-
|  ||  || colspan=7 | "man that gave rice to the child"
|-
|-
|  || b. || nagbigay || ng || bigas || na || '''lalaki''' || sa || bata
|-
|   ||  || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|comp}} || man || {{sc|dat}} || child
|-
|  ||  || colspan=7 | "man that gave rice to the child"
|}

In (4), the head, ''lalaki'' 'man', is found after or to the right of the relative clause, ''nagbigay ng bigas sa bata'' 'gave rice to the child'. In (5), the head is found in some position inside the relative clause. Note that when the head appears to the right of or internally to the relative clause, the complementiser appears to the left of the head. When the head surfaces to the left of the relative clause, the complementiser surfaces to the right of the head.

There are exceptions to the subjects-only constraint to relativisation mentioned above. The first involves relativising the [[Possession (linguistics)|possessor]] of a noun phrase within the relative clause.

:{|
| (6) || '''bata''' || =ng || nasugatan || ang || daliri || ____
|-
|   || child || {{sc|comp}} || injured.{{sc|psv}} || {{sc|nom}} || finger ||
|-
|  || colspan=6 | "child whose finger was injured"
|}

In (6), the head, ''bata'' 'child', is the owner of the injured finger. Note that ''ang daliri'' 'the finger' is the subject of the verb, ''nasugatan'' 'was injured'.

Another exception involves relativising the [[Oblique case|oblique]] noun phrase.

:{|
| (7) || a. || '''ospital''' || (na) || kung || saan || ipinanganak || si || Juan
|-
|  ||  || hospital || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|q-comp}} || where || {{sc|psv}}.bore || {{sc|nom}} || Juan
|-
|  ||  || colspan=7 | "hospital where Juan was born"
|-
|-
|  || b. || Nagtanong || siya || kung || saan || ipinanganak || si || Juan.
|-
|  ||  || {{sc|act}}.asked || {{sc|3sg.nom}} || {{sc|q-comp}} || where || {{sc|psv}}.bore || {{sc|nom}} || Juan
|-
|  ||  || colspan=7 | "She asked where Juan was born."
|-
|-
|  || c. || Ipinanganak || si || Juan || ''sa'' || ''ospital''.
|-
|   ||  || {{sc|psv}}.bore || {{sc|nom}} || Juan || {{sc|loc}} || hospital
|-
|  ||  || colspan=7 | "Juan was born at the hospital."
|-
|-
|  || d. || Saan || ipinanganak || si || Juan?
|-
|   ||  || where || {{sc|psv}}.bore || {{sc|nom}} || Juan
|-
|  ||  || colspan=7 | "Where was Juan born?"
|}

When an oblique noun phrase is relativised, as in (7a), ''na'' 'that', the complementiser that separates the head from the relative clause, is optional. The relative clause itself is also composed differently. In the examples in (1a), and in (3) to (6), the relative clauses are simple declaratives that contain a gap. However, the relative clause in (7a) looks more like an [[Indirect speech|indirect]] [[Sentence (linguistics)#By purpose|question]], complete with the [[Sentence (linguistics)#By purpose|interrogative]] complementiser, ''kung'' 'if', and a pre-verbally positioned [[Interrogative word|WH-word]] like ''saan'' 'where', as in (7b). The sentence in (7c) is the declarative version of the relative clause in (7a), illustrating where the head, ''ospital'' 'hospital', would have been "before" relativisation. The question in (7d) shows the direct question version of the [[Dependent clause|subordinate]] indirect question in (7b).

====Hawaiian====

Relative clauses in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, W. D., ''Introduction to Hawaiian Grammar'', Dover, 2004 (originally 1864): 45-47.&lt;/ref&gt;  are avoided unless they are short.

If in English a relative clause would have a copula and an adjective, in Hawaiian the antecedent is simply modified by the adjective: "The honest man" instead of "the man who is honest". If the English relative clause would have a copula and a noun, in Hawaiian an appositive is used instead: "Paul, an apostle" instead of "Paul, who was an apostle".

If the English relative pronoun would be the subject of an intransitive or passive verb, in Hawaiian a participle is used instead of a full relative clause:  "the people fallen" instead of "the people who fell"; "the thing given" instead of "the thing that was given". But when the relative clause's antecedent is a person, the English relative pronoun would be the subject of the relative clause, and the relative clause's verb is active and transitive, a relative clause is used and it begins with the relative pronoun ''nana'': ''The one who me (past) sent'' = "the one who sent me".

If in English a relative pronoun would be the object of a relative clause, in Hawaiian the possessive form is used so as to treat the antecedent as something possessed: ''the things of me to have seen'' = "the things that I saw"; ''Here is theirs to have seen'' = This is what they saw".

===Chinese===

====Mandarin====
{{further|Chinese grammar}}
In [[Mandarin Chinese]], the relative clause is similar to other adjectival phrases in that it precedes the noun that it modifies, and ends with the relative particle ''de''. If the relative clause is missing a subject but contains an object (in other words, if the verb is transitive), the main-clause noun is the implied subject of the relative clause:&lt;ref&gt;The examples in this section are from Li, Charles N., and Thompson, Sandra A., ''Mandarin Chinese: A Functional Reference Grammar'', Univ. of California Press, 1981: 579-585.&lt;/ref&gt;

:种水果的农人
:''zhòng shuǐguǒ de nóngrén''
: grow fruit (particle) farmer
: "the fruit-growing farmer" or "the farmer who grows fruit"

If the object but not the subject is missing from the relative clause, the main-clause noun is the implied object of the relative clause:

:他们种的水果
:''tāmen zhòng de shuǐguǒ''
: they grow (particle) fruit
: "the by-them-grown fruit" or "the fruit that they grow"

If both the subject and the object are missing from the relative clause, then the main-clause noun could either be the implied subject or the implied object of the relative clause; sometimes which is intended is clear from the context, especially when the subject or object of the verb must be human and the other must be non-human:

:今天赢的钱付房租
:''jīntiān yíng de qián fù fáng zū''
: today win (particle) money pay house rent
: "the won-today money pays the rent" or "the money that was won today pays the rent"

But sometimes ambiguity arises when it is not clear from the context whether the main-clause noun is intended as the subject or the object of the relative clause:

:昨天批评的人都不在这里
:''zuótiān pīping de rén dōu bu zài zhèlǐ''
:yesterday criticize (particle) person all not at here
:"the people who criticized [others] yesterday are all not here" or "the people whom [others] criticized yesterday are all not here"

However, the first meaning (in which the main-clause noun is the subject) is usually intended, as the second can be unambiguously stated using a passive voice marker:

:昨天被批评的人都不在这里
:''zuótiān bèi pīping de rén dōu bu zài zhèlǐ''
:yesterday (passive marker) criticize (particle) person all not at here
:"the people who were criticized yesterday are all not here"

Sometimes a relative clause has both a subject and an object specified, in which case the main-clause noun is the implied object of an implied preposition in the relative clause:

:我写信的毛笔
:''wŏ xiě xìn de máobǐ''
:I write letter (particle) brushpen
:the brushpen that I write letters with

It is also possible to include the preposition explicitly in the relative clause, but in that case it takes a pronoun object (a [[personal pronoun]] with the function of a relative pronoun):&lt;ref&gt;This example is from Chaofen Sun, ''Chinese: A Linguistic Introduction'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;
:我替他画画的人
:''wŏ tì tā huà huà de rén''
:I for him/her draw picture (particle) person
:"the person for whom I drew the picture"

Free relative clauses are formed in the same way, omitting the modified noun after the particle ''de''. As with bound relative clauses, ambiguity may arise; for example, 吃的 ''chī de'' "eat (particle)" may mean "that which is eaten", i.e. "food", or "those who eat".&lt;ref&gt;Sun (2006), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creoles===

====Hawaiian Creole English====

In [[Hawaiian Creole English]], an English-based [[creole language|creole]] also called Hawaiian Pidgin or simply Pidgin, relative clauses work in a way that is similar to, but not identical to, the way they work in English.&lt;ref&gt;Sakoda, Kent, and Siegel, Jeff. ''Pidgin Grammar'', Bess Press, 2003: pp. 102ff.&lt;/ref&gt; As in English, a relative pronoun that serves as the object of the verb in the relative clause can optionally be omitted: For example,

:''Ai neva si da buk daet Lisa wen bai''
:I never see the book that Lisa (past) buy
:I didn't see the book that Lisa bought

can also be expressed with the relative pronoun omitted, as

:''Ai neva si da buk Lisa wen bai''
:I never see the book Lisa (past) buy
:I didn't see the book Lisa bought

However, relative pronouns serving as the subject of a relative clause show more flexibility than in English; they can be included, as is mandatory in English, they can be omitted, or they can be replaced by another pronoun. For example, all of the following can occur and all mean the same thing:

:''Get wan nada grl hu no kaen ste stil''
:There's one other girl who no can stay still
:There's another girl who cannot stay still

:''Get wan nada grl no kaen ste stil''
:There's one other girl no can stay still

:''Get wan nada grl shi no kaen ste stil''
:There's one other girl she no can stay still

====Gullah====

In [[Gullah language|Gullah]], an English-based creole spoken along the southeastern coast of the United States, no relative pronoun is normally used for the subject of a relative clause. For example:

:''Duh him cry out so''
:It him cry out so
:It's he who cries out so

:''Enty duh dem shum dey?''
:Ain't it them saw_him there?
:Isn't it they who saw him there?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1956">'''Richard J. Arneson''' is an [[American philosopher]] specializing in [[political philosophy]] who has taught at the [[University of California, San Diego]] since 1973. He chaired the department during 1992–1996 and served as graduate adviser. In 1996, he also served as visiting professor in the ethics, politics, and economics program at Yale University. Arneson earned his PhD in philosophy from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1975. His work has largely focused on [[utilitarianism]] and on [[luck egalitarianism]].  He is also a proponent of [[prioritarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Luck Egalitarianism and Prioritarianism," Ethics 110, No. 2 (January, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Arneson has also critiqued Marxism in great depth; he argued that capitalism was exploitative for more complex reasons than the [[labour theory of value]] accounted for. He argued that surplus transfer was only wrong when it was the result of an unequal distribution of social goods. Therefore, under capitalism, the majority of exchanges are inherently exploitative because the benefits end up in the hands of those who do not need it. Nonetheless, surplus transfer is legitimate when it arises independently or when it is used to compensate the unequal distribution of natural endowments and wealth.

The '''right to be heard''' (also children's participation) is a child rights principle as defined by the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. According to Article 12 of the Convention, children have the right to express their views in all matters affecting them and their views have to be given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child. This right applies equally to children’s participation in social and political matters as well as in judicial and administrative proceedings. As a general principle, the child’s right to be heard reflects the concept of children‘s ‘agency’, viewing children not only as [[social vulnerability|vulnerable persons]] in need of special protection, but also as informed decision makers, rights holders and active members of society.&lt;ref&gt;[[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to be heard from Article 12 relates closely to other articles under the Convention, which together form the so-called ‘participatory rights’ of children and underline the understanding of children as citizens who are rights holders. These articles include:
* Article 13 - the child’s right to seek, receive and impart information 
* Article 14 - freedom of thought, conscience and religion 
* Article 15 - freedom of association.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund, Implementation Handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Fully Revised Edition, New York, 2002, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enabling factors ==

=== Trust === 
Trust is a key element of encouraging a child to express their views. Strategies for building trust with children include: 
* Demonstrate that you care for and respect the child as a person.
* Ask the girl or boy how she or he is, how she or he feels about where they are living and their life situation, ask if there is anything she or he needs. 
* Engage in a gentle conversation with the child about day-to-day matters. 
* Show empathy and express positive feelings. Talk to the child about things that are important to the child and that interest her or him.
* Sense if the child is comfortable talking with you, reassure the child and give the child a feeling of control of what is happening. 
* Make the meeting room child-friendly. 
* Introduce yourself and explain your professional role. 
* Explain the purpose of your meeting and what the meeting is about, why you are there to talk to the child and what will happen afterwards. 
* Allocate sufficient time to speak to the child and to listen.
* Provide quality interpretation and cultural mediation wherever required. 
* Give the child time to reflect about the information you shared, to digest it and to come back for a second or third meeting, if and as required and appropriate. 
* Ask the child if she or he has understood the information and to explain what they understood, and take time to ask the questions you need to ask.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children's Fund, Communicating With Children, Principles and practices to nurture, inspire, excite, educate and heal, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Age-sensitive communication ===
In the cases of younger children or children with impaired cognitive skills, the child’s participation can be through drawing or play, or by observing of the child’s behaviour with family members and care staff. Adapting the language to the age and development of the child helps insure the child can understand the issues at stake and express her or his feelings and views.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children's Fund, Communicating With Children, Principles and practices to nurture, inspire, excite, educate and heal, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Economic and Social Council, Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime, Economic and Social Council Resolution 2005/20, 22 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Save the Children, Communicating with Children, Helping children in distress, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

National laws usually define age limits for children to have the right to contact social services on their own initiative, to be heard in judicial and administrative procedures, to act as a litigant or party to a case, to appeal against decisions, and to complain and seek redress. The age limits defined under national law differ among countries and, in some cases, also between the various laws applying to different groups of children and contexts. The right of younger children to be heard is often not addressed in the same way as the right of adolescents. Special measures nationally can ensure younger children are not excluded from exercising their right to be heard.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 12 (2009). UNHCR Guidelines on Child Asylum Claims.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender considerations for the right to be heard ===
For some children, the gender of the interviewer, interpreter, cultural mediator, guardian or care staff may change their willingness to express themselves. The may depend on the experiences that children have with men and women in their homes and communities, and if in [[Child migration|migration]], during their journey or in places of destination. Traditional gender roles and relations can also play a role. The [[gender identity]] of the child should be respected.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Economic and Social Council, Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime, Economic and Social Council Resolution 2005/20, 22 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Save the Children, Communicating with Children, Helping children in distress, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enabling factors in transnational cases ==
Many children do not want to tell their story to the authorities because they fear it might not be in their interest and might lead to unwanted consequences, such as being returned. Children might have been instructed or even threatened by third persons to only tell parts of their story, and the child might not trust the police and local authorities can protect them. A reception system that respects and upholds the dignity of the child can foster a sense of trust.

== Quality interpretation and cultural mediation ==
[[Interpreters]] can influence the information gathering process in [[transnational child protection]] cases, [[Right of asylum|asylum]] procedures and criminal investigations as they affect how the child’s disclosure is being understood and perceived. Inaccurate translation might compromise the child’s statement to the effect that decisions are taken on the basis of incorrect information. This relates not only to the content translated but also to the style and semantic choices made by the child and how these are rendered by the interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;Crawley, Heaven, Working with Children and Young People Subject to Immigration Control, Guidelines for best practice, Second Edition, Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to training and recruiting qualified interpreters, the following measures protect the child's right to be heard: 
* Clarify which authority is responsible for providing interpretation.
* Make the participation of an interpreter mandatory whenever a child does not master the official language of the interview.
* Avoid the use of informal interpreters, such as family members, other children, other asylum seekers or staff.
* Use telephone interpretation when a qualified and suitable interpreter is not available locally. 
* Train law enforcement officers, immigration officials and other interviewers as well as the interpreters on how to collaborate in the context of interviews with children. 
* Develop standard procedures to ensure quality and ethical standards of interpretation and confidentiality.
* Train interpreters to act also as cultural mediators.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund, Let’s Talk, Developing effective communication with children victims of violence and trafficking, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, The Heart of the Matter, Assessing credibility when children apply for asylum in the European Union, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 12, The right of the child to be heard, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hearing a child in investigations and proceedings ==
Child victims of crime have a right to be protected from harm and secondary victimisation during investigations and proceedings. The standards for are described in the UN Guidelines on Justice in Matters Involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/docs/2005/resolution 2005-20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse]] and the 2011 EU Anti-Trafficking Directive.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:101:0001:0011:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; The following protect children from harm in investigations and proceedings: 
* Repeat interviews during the investigation, prosecution and trial only when necessary. 
* Use video recorded interviews or similar to avoid the child victim or witness giving evidence in open court and to prevent visual contact between victims, witnesses and defendants. 
* Specifically trained professionals conduct the interviews with child, preferably the same person each time. 
* Conduct interviews in a child-friendly environment.

The Children’s House model  is a good practice for conducting forensic interviews and gathering evidence from child victims of crime.,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/docs/2005/resolution 2005-20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse]] and the 2011 EU Anti-Trafficking Directive.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:101:0001:0011:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forensic interviews ==
Interview style and the type of questions asked affect the quality of the interview. They can influence the child’s willingness to disclose information. They can also influence the type and quality of information, and the level of detail, that the child is able and willing to share. Strategies for interviewers and interpreters to lessen this include prioritising open questions and avoiding closed and focused questions, suggestive prompts and leading questions; remaining neutral; be open and empathic; avoid criticism and confrontations.&lt;ref&gt;PROTECT 2nd Expert Meeting, Riga, May 2014, presentation by Ann-Christin Cederborg, University Stockholm.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society is open to anyone interested in philosophy who considers himself or herself a [[Christian]]. Membership is not restricted to any particular "school" of philosophy or to any branch of Christianity, nor to professional or academic philosophers.

Meetings of the Society are regularly held in conjunction with the [[American Catholic Philosophical Association]], the Eastern, Central, and Pacific Divisions of the [[American Philosophical Association]], and the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]], and at the [[World Congress of Philosophy]].

The Society also publishes a quarterly journal, [[Faith and Philosophy]], which addresses philosophical issues from a Christian perspective. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://societyofchristianphilosophers.com/index.php/faith-and-philosophy-journal/|title=Faith and Philosophy Journal – The Society of Christian Philosophers|website=societyofchristianphilosophers.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary|specialisation}}
'''Specialisation''', ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C_-ize_.28-isation.2C_-ization.29|or]] '''specialization''') is an important way to generate [[propositional knowledge]], by applying general knowledge, such as the [[theory of gravity]], to specific instances, such as "when I release this apple, it will fall to the floor". Specialisation is the opposite of [[generalisation]].

Concept B is a '''specialisation''' of concept A if and only if:
* every instance of concept B is also an instance of concept A; and
* there are instances of concept A which are not instances of concept B.

'''Svetozar "Sveta" Stojanović''' (Serbian Cyrillic: Светозар Стојановић) (18 October 1931 – 7 May 2010) was a Serbian philosopher and political theorist.

==Biography==
Stojanović was an intellectual in the European tradition, an academic who contributed to philosophical theory and engaged in practical politics. He bridged the divide between the more grand and speculative Continental philosophy and analytic Anglo-American ethical theory. His doctoral dissertation on Contemporary Meta-ethics was grounded on his study of ordinary language analysis at the University of Oxford and later he met weekly at the University of Michigan to discuss ethical issues with [[William Frankena]], [[Richard Brandt]] and [[Charles Stevenson]]. But the focus of his important contributions to philosophy was always critical Marxism, Marxism creatively interpreted as a critique of social institutions destructive of humanistic values. He is best known for his rejection of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] and advocacy of a [[democratic socialism]].

Svetozar Stojanović was born in 1931 in [[Kragujevac]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] (present day [[Serbia]]) and received a PhD in philosophy from the [[University of Belgrade]] in 1962.  Together with seven other professors and teachers, called [[The Praxis Group]], he was expelled from the [[University of Belgrade]] in January 1975 for dissident activities during [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s regime in Yugoslavia.  He returned to the University in the early nineties as socialist Yugoslavia was falling apart. In 1992 and 1993 he served as a special adviser to former Yugoslav President [[Dobrica Ćosić]].

Stojanović was a longtime critic of [[Slobodan Milošević]], and one of the protagonists in the October 2000 Serbian democratic revolution which culminated in the [[overthrow of Slobodan Milošević|overthrow of Milošević]]. He was appointed to the Commission for Truth and Reconciliation by former Yugoslav President [[Vojislav Koštunica]], and later became a member of the Council for Foreign Relations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Serbia.

Stojanovic was a member of the [[Council for Secular Humanism]]'s [[International Academy of Humanism]], a member of the Paris International Institute of Philosophy (''Institut International de Philosophie'') and the Academy of Humanistic Studies in Moscow. In 1973 he was one of the signers of the ''[[Humanist Manifesto II]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II | title=Humanist Manifesto II | publisher=American Humanist Association | accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was co-chairman of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]], 1985-87.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iheu.org/node/2239&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a long-time director of the Institute for Philosophy and Social Theory in Belgrade and the member of the governing board of [[Korčula Summer School]].  Stojanović was a visiting professor at many prominent universities in the United States, Germany, Great Britain, Austria, and India.

With Djuro Kovacevic, another Serbian political theorist, Stojanović was a co-founder and president of the Serbian-American Center in Belgrade, which developed into the Center for National Strategy, and the Forum for Serbian-American Dialogue and Cooperation.

He was the chief editor of ''[[Praxis International]]'' from 1987–1990 and, most recently, a member of the editorial council of ''Philosophy &amp; Social Criticism'', based in Boston.

Stojanović authored seven books, four brochures, and 130 journal articles.  His works have been translated into fourteen languages, including English, German, French, Russian, Spanish, and Japanese.  Books in English include: ''Between Ideals and Reality: A Critique of Socialism and Its Future'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1973; ''In Search of Democracy in Socialism'', [[Prometheus Books]], Buffalo, NY, 1981; ''From Marxism and Bolshevism to Gorbachev'', Prometheus Books, 1988; ''The Fall of Yugoslavia: Why Communism Failed'', Prometheus  Books, 1997; and ''Serbia: The Democratic Revolution'', [[Humanity Books]], Buffalo, NY, 2003.

[[File:The Concept of Law.jpg|thumb|First edition]]
'''''The Concept of Law''''' ({{ISBN|0-19-876122-8}}) is the most famous work of the [[legal philosophy|legal philosopher]] [[H. L. A. Hart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.angelfire.com/md2/timewarp/hart.html|title = H.L.A. Hart’s The Concept of Law|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was first published in 1961 and develops Hart's theory of [[legal positivism]] (the view that laws are rules made by human beings and that there is no inherent or necessary connection between law and [[morality]]) within the framework of [[analytic philosophy]].  In this work, Hart sets out to write an essay of descriptive [[sociology]] and [[analytical jurisprudence]].  ''The Concept of Law'' provides an explanation to a number of traditional jurisprudential questions such as "what is law?", "must laws be rules?", and "what is the relation between law and morality?".  Hart answers these by placing law into a social context while at the same time leaving the capability for rigorous analysis of legal terms, which in effect "awakened English jurisprudence from its comfortable slumbers".&lt;ref name="Postema"&gt;{{cite book|last=Postema|first=Gerald|title=Legal Philosophy in the Twentieth Century: The Common Law World|editor=Enrico Pattaro|publisher=Springer|date=2011|series=A Treatise of Legal Philosophy and General Jurisprudence|volume=11|pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result Hart's book has remained "one of the most influential text of analytical legal philosophy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/the-endless-search-for-truth/|title=The Endless Search For Truth: Richard Marshall interviews Andrei Marmor|last=Marshall|first=Richard|date=2012-07-06|publisher=[[3:AM Magazine]]|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "the most successful work of analytical jurisprudence ever to appear in the common law world"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=A. W. Brian|title=Reflections on 'The Concept of Law'|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2011|pages=1|isbn=0199693323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''The Concept of Law'' emerged from a set of lectures Hart delivered in 1952. The lectures were preceded by Hart's Holmes lecture, ''Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals'' at [[Harvard Law School]]. The book developed a sophisticated view of legal positivism.

Among the ideas developed in the book are:
*A critique of [[John Austin (legal philosophy)|John Austin's]] theory that law is the command of the sovereign backed by sanction.
*A distinction between primary and secondary legal rules, where a primary rule governs conduct and a secondary rule allows the creation, alteration, or extinction of primary rules.
*A distinction between the internal and external points of view of law and rules, close to (and influenced by) [[Max Weber]]'s distinction between the sociological and the legal perspectives of law.
*The idea of the [[rule of recognition]], a social rule that differentiated between those norms that have the authority of law and those that do not. Hart viewed the rule of recognition as an evolution from [[Hans Kelsen]]'s "''[[Grundnorm]]''", or "basic norm".
*A reply to [[Ronald Dworkin]], who criticized legal positivism in general and especially Hart's account of law in ''Taking Rights Seriously'' (1977), ''A Matter of Principle'' (1985) and ''Law's Empire'' (1986).

==Austin's "command theory"==
The starting point for the discussion is Hart's dissatisfaction with [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]'s "command theory": a jurisprudential concept that holds that law is command backed by threat and is meant to be ubiquitous in its application.  Hart likens Austin's theory to the role of a [[gun|gunman]] in a [[bank]] and tries to establish the differences between the gunman's orders and those made by law. (For instance, the gunman forces us to obey but we may not feel inclined to obey him. Presumably, obedience to the law comes with a different feeling.) 

Hart identifies three such important differences: content, origin, and range. In terms of content, not all laws are imperative or [[coercive]]. Some are facilitative, allowing us to create [[contracts]] and other legal relations.

Austin believed that every legal system had to have a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] who creates the law (origin) while remaining unaffected by it (range), such as the bank scene's gunman, who is the only source of commands and who is not subject to other's commands.  Hart argues that this is an inaccurate description of law, noting that laws may have several sources and legislators are very often subject to the laws they create. Hart lets us know that laws are much broader in scope than coercive orders, contrary to the "command theory" of Austin. Frequently laws are enabling and so allow citizens to carry out authoritative acts such as the making of wills or contracts which have legal effect.

==Social habits and rules==
Hart draws a distinction between a social [[Habit (psychology)|habit]] (which people follow habitually but where breaking the habit does not bring about opprobrium - going to the cinema on Thursday for example) and a social rule (where breaking the rule is seen as wrong - neglecting to take off one's hat upon entering a church, for example).  We feel in some sense bound by social rules and laws frequently appear to be types of social rule. 

There are two perspectives to this: the external aspect, which is the independently observable fact that people do tend to obey the rule with regularity, and the internal aspect which is the feeling by an individual of being in some sense obligated to follow the rule, otherwise known as the critical reflective attitude. It is from this internal sense that the law acquires its normative quality. The obedience by the populace of a rule is called efficacy. No law can be said to be efficacious unless followed by the majority of the populace. Though an average citizen in a modern state with a developed legal system may feel the internal aspect and be compelled to follow the laws, it is more important for the officials of the society/peoples to have  the internal aspect since it is up to them to follow the constitutional provisions which, if they wish, could ignore without accountability. Yet, the officials must use the internal aspect and accept the standards as guiding their behaviour in addition to also guiding the behaviour of other officials.

==Hart's Empirical Legal System in "The Concept of Law"==
Hart believed law is the union of '''primary rules''' (rules of conduct) and '''secondary rules''' (empowering rules). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hart|first1=H.L.A.|title=The Concept of Law|date=1994|page=94|edition=2d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary Rules===
''Primary rules'' are rules, or laws, that govern general societal conduct. Thus, ''primary rules'' construct legal obligations and consequences when they are disobeyed. A good example of a ''primary rule'' is the law against murder; it prohibits a person from killing and attaches consequences for committing, attempting to commit, and conspiring to commit the crime.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.93&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary Rules===
''Secondary rules'' confer power to create sovereignty; they also confer the power to change, modify, or enforce primary (and secondary) rules.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.93-120&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary rules combat the three major issues of legal systems that ''primary rules'' can't–(1) &lt;u&gt;uncertainty&lt;/u&gt; of the law, (2) &lt;u&gt;efficiency&lt;/u&gt; of the law, and (3) &lt;u&gt;static&lt;/u&gt; ''quality'' of the law. Each kind of ''secondary rule'' addresses a separate one of those three issues, yet all are interdependent.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.93-97&lt;/ref&gt; Hart separates secondary rules into three types–the '''rules of recognition''', the '''rules of change''', and the '''rules of adjudication'''.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.93-120&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rules of Recognition====
Hart states that the remedy for the &lt;u&gt;uncertainty&lt;/u&gt; of the regime of primary rules is a ''rule of recognition''. &lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.94&lt;/ref&gt; The rule of recognition is a collection of standards and requisites that govern the validity of all rules; thus, the rule of recognition confers power to new rules by validating them. For a rule to be valid is to recognize it as passing all the tests provided by the rule of recognition. &lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.103&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Rules of Change====
There are no legal systems that can be classified as [[pareto optimal]]. The next best thing is to make sure that the system does not remain at a static quality but instead is dynamic and progressive. The remedy for the &lt;u&gt;static&lt;/u&gt; quality of the regime of ''primary rules'' are ''rules of change''.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.95&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, rules of change confer and prohibit power of the creation, extinction and alteration of primary and secondary rules. Rules of change range in complexity: “the powers conferred may be unrestricted or limited in various ways: and the rules may, besides specifying the persons who are to legislate, define in more or less rigid terms the procedure to be followed in legislation.” As mentioned earlier, rules of change are interdependent with the other rules. Hart emphasizes the “close connection between the rules of change and the rules of recognition.” Where rules of change exist, rules of recognition "ʺwill necessarily incorporate a reference to legislation as an identifying feature of the rules, though it need not refer to all the details of procedure involved in legislation.” &lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Rules of Adjudication====
''Rules of adjudication'' were intended to remedy the &lt;u&gt;inefficiency&lt;/u&gt; of its diffused social pressure. Rules of adjudication empower individuals to make authoritative determinations of the question whether, on a particular occasion, a primary rule has been broken.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.96-97 (“Besides identifying the individuals who are to adjudicate, such rules will also define the procedure to be followed”)&lt;/ref&gt; Rules of adjudication govern the election and procedure of the judiciary. However, intermingled with who adjudicates is what laws they adjudicate. &lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.96-97 (Hart emphasizes that “if courts are empowered to make authoritative determinations of the fact that a rule has been broken, these cannot avoid being taken as authoritative determinations of what the rules are.”)&lt;/ref&gt; Under that logic, rules of adjudication, like rules of change, must also be supplemented by rules of recognition of some sort. Thus, “the rule which confers jurisdiction will also be a rule of recognition, identifying the primary rules through the judgments of the courts and these judgments will become a 'source' of law.”&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.96-97 (Hart emphasizes that a “system which has rules of adjudication is necessarily also committed to a rule of recognition of an elementary and imperfect sort.”)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thilo Friedrich Maatsch''' (born August 13, 1900 in [[Braunschweig]], died March 20, 1983 in [[Königslutter]]) was a German artist and an exponent of [[abstract art]], [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]] and [[concrete art]].

== Life ==
Whilst visiting exhibitions in his youth he came in touch with art. Especially the upcoming modernism affected him and his work of art a lot. 18 years after his 
birth he founded with [[Johannes Molzahn]] and [[Rudolf Jahns]] the 
"Gesellschaft der Freunde junger Kunst" (Society of the adorer of young art) which were joined by several distinguished artist as e.g. [[Lyonel Feininger]] and [[Paul Klee]]. The collector [[Otto Ralfs]] supported this organisation and Kandinsky designed the signet. 
Maatsch's circle of friends and acquaintances ranked among  the aforementioned 
artists, [[László Moholy-Nagy]], [[William Wauer]] and [[Lothar Schreyer]]. 
Kandinsky nurtured Maatsch's talent and he admired him like his own 
father. Due to financial problems it was not possible for Maatsch to study at the [[Bauhaus]], because of his young family he also had to nourish. 
But his desire for studies remained not any longer unfulfilled. Moholy-Nagy, Kandinsky and Klee permitted him to study in their studios. Most probably Kandinsky together with the Bauhaus figuered out a permission for Maatsch to attend Bauhaus in [[Berlin]] and [[Weimar]] in his holidays (he worked as a teacher in Königslutter) without paying fees.

In 1925 he joined the [[November Group (German)|November Group]] and from this year onwards till 1932 he participated annually in the renowned "Große Berliner Kunstausstellung". In 1927 [[Herwarth Walden]], one of the most important discoverers and promoters of German avant-garde art in the early twentieth century, arranged for Maatsch an exhibition in his prestigious gallery "Der Sturm". Determined by the Nazi policy his art work was considered as degenerated and he withered on the vine. Maatsch's rediscovery ensued 1966.
