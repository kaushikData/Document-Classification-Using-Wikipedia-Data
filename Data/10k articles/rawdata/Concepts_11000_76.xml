      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7221">'''Abdul Rahman Al-Lahim''' (alternatively al-Lahem) (born 1971) is a [[Saudi]] human rights lawyer active in defending the civil rights of Saudi citizens.&lt;ref name="Nathaniel Rosenblatt 2008, p. 96"&gt;Nathaniel Rosenblatt, Abdul Rahman al-Lahim, Middle East Quarterly, Spring 2008, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Lahim was born in the deeply conservative [[Al-Qassim Province|Qassim]] region. Until the late 1990s, Al-Lahim, who holds a degree in sharia, was an Arabic teacher as well as an [[Islamist]], active in As-Sahwa al-Islamiyya. He is married and the father of two.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/22/AR2006122201579.html Saudi Lawyer Takes On Religious Court System]&lt;/ref&gt;

He became committed to civil rights while attending "Sharia school" in [[Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University]] in Riyadh.&lt;ref name="Washington Post, Dec. 23, 2006"/&gt; According to analysts of his work, Al-Lahim is effective because "He not only crafts effective legal arguments, but he also understands the conservative forces that hold the gavel."&lt;ref name="Nathaniel Rosenblatt 2008, p. 96"/&gt;

On 6 November 2004, Al-Lahim was arrested by Saudi authorities for defending three reform activists on trial in Saudi Arabia charged with "issuing statements and collecting as many signatures as possible on petitions" calling for reforms in the Kingdom as well as of calling for the adoption of a constitutional monarchy and "using Western terminology" in demanding political reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=54195&amp;d=9&amp;m=11&amp;y=2004 Reformists’ Lawyer Arrested After Letter Sent to Crown Prince by Raid Qusti for Arab News 9 November 2004 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090651/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=54195&amp;d=9&amp;m=11&amp;y=2004 |date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All three activists and Al-Lahem were released in early August 2005 at the intervention of King Abdullah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=68237&amp;d=10&amp;m=8&amp;y=2005 Abdullah’s Noble Gesture Thanked 10 August 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090703/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=68237&amp;d=10&amp;m=8&amp;y=2005 |date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, he defended a high school teacher, Mohammad Al-Harbi, who had been sentenced to a punishment of 750 public lashes for mocking religion by speaking out against terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=73171&amp;d=14&amp;m=11&amp;y=2005 Teacher Charged With Mocking Religion Sentenced to Jail By Ebtihal Mubarak for Arab News, 14 November 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090716/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=73171&amp;d=14&amp;m=11&amp;y=2005 |date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=7&amp;section=0&amp;article=73404&amp;d=19&amp;m=11&amp;y=2005 Extremism Rears Its Ugly Head - Arab News 19 November 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090749/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=7&amp;section=0&amp;article=73404&amp;d=19&amp;m=11&amp;y=2005 |date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Harbi later received a royal pardon and all charges were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=74352&amp;d=8&amp;m=12&amp;y=2005 All Charges Against Al-Harbi Dropped, Arab news, 8 December 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090801/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=74352&amp;d=8&amp;m=12&amp;y=2005 |date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=77469&amp;d=8&amp;m=2&amp;y=2006 Lack of Clear Guidelines Irks Lawyers, Defendants, Arab News, 8 February 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090809/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=77469&amp;d=8&amp;m=2&amp;y=2006 |date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Al-Lahim also defended the rape victim known as the "[[Qatif girl rape case|Qatif girl]]" from a sentence of 200 public lashes and faced disbarment for taking her case.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/01/world/01saudi.html Saudi Rape Case Spurs Calls for Reform, New York Times, 1 December 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; He was suspended from the case as a result of the appeal against the punishment and his licence, granted to Saudi lawyers by the ministry of justice, was revoked. He was charged with criticizing the judiciary and conducting activist campaigns in the media.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/17/saudiarabia.international Rape victim sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in jail]&lt;/ref&gt; Later his license was returned to him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=105880&amp;d=20&amp;m=1&amp;y=2008&amp;pix=kingdom.jpg&amp;category=Kingdom Qatif Girl’s Lawyer Gets His License Back] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090843/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=105880&amp;d=20&amp;m=1&amp;y=2008&amp;pix=kingdom.jpg&amp;category=Kingdom |date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights organization Amnesty International criticized the persecution of al-Lahem.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/saudi-arabia-lawyer-must-not-be-punished-defending-gang-rape-victim-2007 Saudi Arabia: Lawyer must not be punished  for defending gang rape victim]&lt;/ref&gt;

A travel ban has been imposed against Al-Lahim since 2004 and protested by human right organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontlinedefenders.org/node/1437 Saudi Arabia: Travel ban on human rights defender Abdul]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Al-Lahim was awarded The American Bar Association’s 2008 International Human Rights Lawyer Award in Vienna, although he was unable to attend due to his travel ban.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=111187&amp;d=24&amp;m=6&amp;y=2008 Rights lawyer’s request to lift travel curbs in abeyance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090918/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=111187&amp;d=24&amp;m=6&amp;y=2008 |date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American gentry''' were members of the [[American upper class]]es, particularly early in the settlement of the [[United States]].
[[File:Mtvernon1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mount Vernon]], [[Virginia]], was the [[plantation#Other types of plantation|plantation]] home of George Washington.]]

The [[Thirteen Colonies|Colonial American]] use of ''[[gentry]]'' followed the British usage (i.e., [[landed gentry]]) before the independence of the United States. The [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] was commonly evidenced in land holdings by estate owners in Virginia, Maryland and the Carolinas. North of Maryland, there were few large compatible rural estates, except in the Dutch domains in the Hudson Valley of New York.

The families of Virginia (see [[First Families of Virginia]]) who formed the Virginia gentry class, such as General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s ancestors, were among the earliest settlers in Virginia. Lee's family of [[Stratford Hall (plantation)|Stratford Hall]] was considered among the oldest of the Virginia [[Gentleman#Robert E. Lee|gentry class]]. Lee's family is one of Virginia's first families, originally arriving in Virginia from England in the early 1600s with the arrival of [[Richard Lee I]], Esq., "the Immigrant" (1618–64), from the county of [[Shropshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother grew up at [[Shirley Plantation]], one of the most elegant homes in Virginia. His maternal great-great grandfather, [[Robert "King" Carter]] of [[Corotoman]], was the wealthiest man in [[Thirteen Colonies|the colonies]] when he died in 1732. 

[[Thomas Jefferson]], the patron of American [[agrarianism]], wrote in his ''Notes on Virginia'' (1785), "Those who labor in the earth are the chosen people of God, if He ever had a chosen people, whose breasts He has made His peculiar deposit for substantial and genuine virtue."  Jefferson who spent much of his childhood at [[Tuckahoe Plantation]] was a great-grandson of [[William Randolph]] a colonist and land owner who arrived in Virginia from England in the mid 1600s and played an important role in the history and government of the English colony of Virginia.

[[George Washington]], the first president of the United States was also the wealthiest man to ever hold the office&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/02/15/10-richest-presidents/5514567/|title=Report: The 10 richest U.S. presidents|newspaper=USA TODAY|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the election of Donald Trump in 2016 according to valuations of his putative assets.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Seales, [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38637123 "Eight ways President Donald Trump will make history"], BBC News, 2017-01-21&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a commercial farmer much interested in innovations, and happily quit his public duties in 1783 and again in 1797 to manage his plantation at Mount Vernon. Washington lived an upper-class lifestyle—fox hunting was a favorite leisure activity enjoyed by gentry, worldwide. Like most planters in Virginia, Washington imported luxury items and other fine wares from England. He paid for them by exporting his tobacco crop. 

Extravagant spending and the unpredictability of the tobacco market meant that many Virginia planters financial resources were unstable. Thomas Jefferson was deeply in debt when he died and his heirs were forced to sell Monticello to cover his debts. In 1809, [[Henry Lee III]] went bankrupt and served one year in [[debtors' prison]] in [[Montross, Virginia]]; his son, Robert E. Lee was two years old at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/lee_henry.html|title= A Princeton Companion (Lee, Henry)|year=1978|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/lee_henry.html| title= Stratford Hall/Lee Family Tree: Henry Lee III|accessdate= 20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;Despondent and nearly broke, [[William Byrd III]] of [[Westover Plantation]] committed suicide in 1777. 

Wood notes that "Few members of the American gentry were able to live idly off the rents of tenants as the English landed aristocracy did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon S. Wood|title=The Radicalism of the American Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6lGinKwz7l8C&amp;pg=PA113|year=2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some landowners, especially in the Dutch areas of upstate New York, leased out their lands to tenants, but generally —"[[Plain Folk of the Old South]]"— ordinary farmers owned their cultivated holdings.&lt;ref&gt;Charles C.

==The first families of Virginia and Maryland==

[[First Families of Virginia]] originated with colonists from England who primarily settled at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and along the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] and other navigable waters in the [[Colony of Virginia]] during the 17th century. As there was a propensity to marry within their narrow social scope for many generations, many descendants bear surnames which became common in the growing colony.

Many of the original English colonists considered members of the First Families of Virginia migrated to the [[Colony of Virginia]] during the [[English Civil War]] and [[English Interregnum]] period (1642–1660). Royalists left England on the accession to power of Oliver Cromwell and his Parliament. Because most of Virginia's leading families recognized [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King following the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, Charles II is reputed to have called Virginia his "Old Dominion", a nickname that endures today. The affinity of many early aristocratic Virginia settlers for the Crown led to the term "distressed Cavaliers", often applied to the Virginia oligarchy. Many Cavaliers who served under King Charles I fled to Virginia. Thus, it came to be that FFVs often refer to Virginia as "Cavalier Country". These men were offered rewards of land, etc., by King Charles II, but they had settled Virginia and so remained in Virginia.

Most of such early settlers in Virginia were so-called "Second Sons".  [[Primogeniture]] favored the first sons' inheriting lands and titles in England. Virginia evolved in a society of second or third sons of English aristocracy who inherited [[land grant]]s or land in Virginia. They formed part of the southern elite in America.

Many of the great Virginia dynasties traced their roots to families like the [[Lee family|Lees]] and the Fitzhughs, who traced lineage to England's county families and baronial legacies. But not all: even the most humble Virginia immigrants aspired to the English manorial trappings of their "betters." Virginia history is not the sole province of English aristocrats. Such families as the Shackelfords, who gave their name to a Virginia hamlet, rose from modest beginnings in Hampshire to a place in the Virginia firmament based on hard work and "smart" marriages. Some families like the  Gilliams arrived in Virginia in the 17th century as [[indentured servants]]. By the late 18th century through hard work and "smart" marriages the Gilliam family had risen from servitude to landed gentry having amassed several large plantations including [[Weston Manor]].  Families such as the [[Mathews family (Virginia)|Mathews]] from the later [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish immigration]] also formed political dynasties in Old Virginia. At the same time, other once-great families were decimated not only by the [[English Civil War]], but also by the enormous power of the London merchants to whom they were in debt and who could move markets "with the stroke of a pen."

The [[Colonial families of Maryland]] were the leading families in the [[Province of Maryland]]. Several also had interests in the [[Colony of Virginia]], and the two are sometimes referred to as the [[Chesapeake Colonies]]. Many of the early settlers came from the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] in England, although the Maryland families were composed of a variety of European nationalities, e.g., French, Irish, Welsh, Scottish, and Swedish, in addition to English.

The Carroll family is an example of a prominent political family from Maryland, of Irish descent and origin in the ancient kingdom of Éile, commonly anglicized Ely, as a branch of the ruling O'Carroll family. Another is the Mason family of Virginia, who descended from the progenitor of the Mason family, [[George Mason I]], a [[Cavalier]] member of the [[Parliament of England]] born in Worcestershire, England.  The Riggin family of Maryland who also had holdings on the [[Eastern Shore of Virginia]] is of Irish descent and origin in the ancient [[kingdom of Meath]]. The surname is an anglicization of the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] Ó Riagáin. The Ó Riagáins were one of the families that made up the [[Four Tribes of Tara]], an alliance of powerful clans. The Four Tribes were major defenders of Ireland against [[Viking]] invasions during the 8th and 9th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ireland-calling.com/irish-names-regan/|title=Regan – direct descendants of Brian Boru|newspaper=Ireland Calling|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ó Riagáins were chiefs of Hy-Riagain, now the barony of Tinnehinch in the [[County Laois|Queen's County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.libraryireland.com/Pedigrees1/Meath.php|title=Irish Chiefs and Clans in the County Meath|website=www.libraryireland.com|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles I of England]] granted the province [[County palatine|palatinate]] status under [[Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]]. The foundational charter created an aristocracy of [[lords of the manor]] for Maryland. Maryland was uniquely created as a colony for [[Catholic church|Catholic]] aristocracy and [[landed gentry]], but [[Anglicanism]] eventually came to dominate, partly through influence from neighboring Virginia.

[[File:Scout Girl in Concentration.jpg|thumb|Focused attention]]

'''Attention''' is the behavioral and [[cognition|cognitive process]] of selectively concentrating on a discrete aspect of information, whether deemed subjective or objective, while ignoring other perceivable information. It is a state of [[arousal]]. It is the taking possession by the mind in clear and vivid form of one out of what seem several simultaneous objects or trains of thought. [[Focalization]], the concentration of [[consciousness]], is of its essence. Attention has also been described as the [[Attention economy|allocation]] of limited cognitive processing resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=John R. |authorlink=John Robert Anderson (psychologist) |year=2004 |title=Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications |edition=6th |publisher=Worth Publishers |url= https://books.google.com/?id=9P4p6eAULMoC |isbn=978-0-7167-0110-1 |page=519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attention remains a major area of investigation within [[education]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], and [[neuropsychology]]. Areas of active investigation involve determining the source of the sensory cues and signals that generate attention, the effects of these sensory cues and signals on the [[neuronal tuning|tuning]] properties of sensory [[neurons]], and the relationship between attention and other behavioral and cognitive processes like [[working memory]] and [[vigilance (psychology)|psychological vigilance]]. A relatively new body of research, which expands upon earlier research within psychopathology, is investigating the diagnostic symptoms associated with [[traumatic brain injury]] and its effects on attention. Attention also varies across cultures.&lt;ref name="Chavajay 1999 1079–1090"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chavajay|first=P |first2= B |last2= Rogoff|title=Cultural Variation in Management of Attention by Children and Their Caregivers|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1999|volume=35|issue=4|pages=1079–90|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.35.4.1079|pmid=10442876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationships between attention and [[consciousness]] are complex enough that they have warranted perennial philosophical exploration. Such exploration is both ancient and continually relevant, as it can have effects in fields ranging from [[mental health]] and the study of [[disorders of consciousness]] to [[artificial intelligence]] and its domains of research and development.

==Contemporary definition and research==
Prior to the founding of [[psychology]] as a scientific discipline, attention was studied in the field of [[philosophy]]. Thus, many of the discoveries in the field of attention were made by philosophers. Psychologist [[John B. Watson]] calls [[Juan Luis Vives]] the father of modern psychology because, in his book ''De Anima et Vita'' (''The Soul and Life''), he was the first to recognize the importance of empirical investigation.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2004 1–24"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Addie|title=Attention: Theory and Practice|year=2004|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|isbn=978-0-7619-2760-0|pages=1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his work on memory, Vives found that the more closely one attends to stimuli, the better they will be retained.

By the 1990s, psychologists began using [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and later [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) to image the brain while monitoring tasks involving attention. Because this expensive equipment was generally only available in hospitals, psychologists sought cooperation with neurologists. Psychologist [[Michael Posner (psychologist)|Michael Posner]] (then already renowned for his seminal work on visual selective attention) and neurologist [[Marcus Raichle]] pioneered brain imaging studies of selective attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their results soon sparked interest from the neuroscience community, which had until then focused on monkey brains. With the development of these technological innovations, [[neuroscience|neuroscientists]] became interested in this type of research that combines sophisticated experimental paradigms from [[cognitive psychology]] with these new brain imaging techniques. Although the older technique of [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) had long been used to study the brain activity underlying selective attention by [[psychophysiology|cognitive psychophysiologists]], the ability of the newer techniques to actually measure precisely localized activity inside the brain generated renewed interest by a wider community of researchers.

==Selective and visual==
{{See also|Selective auditory attention}}
[[File:Wikipedia-spotlight.jpg|thumb|200px|right|alt=The spotlight model of attention]]
In [[cognitive psychology]] there are at least two models which describe how visual attention operates. These models may be considered loosely as metaphors which are used to describe internal processes and to generate hypotheses that are [[falsifiable]]. Generally speaking, visual attention is thought to operate as a two-stage process.&lt;ref name="Jonides"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jonides | first = J. | year = 1983 | title = Further towards a model of the mind's eye's movement | url =http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jjonides/pdf/1983_4.pdf | journal = Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 247–50 | doi=10.3758/bf03334699}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first stage, attention is distributed uniformly over the external visual scene and processing of information is performed in parallel. In the second stage, attention is concentrated to a specific area of the visual scene (i.e., it is focused), and processing is performed in a serial fashion.

The first of these models to appear in the literature is the spotlight model. The term "spotlight" was inspired by the work of [[William James]], who described attention as having a focus, a margin, and a fringe.&lt;ref name="Eriksen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eriksen | first1 = C | last2 = Hoffman | first2 = J | year = 1972 | title = Temporal and spatial characteristics of selective encoding from visual displays | url =http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doiLanding&amp;uid=1973-01584-001 | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 12 | issue = 2B| pages = 201–4 | doi = 10.3758/BF03212870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus is an area that extracts information from the visual scene with a high-resolution, the geometric center of which being where visual attention is directed. Surrounding the focus is the fringe of attention, which extracts information in a much more crude fashion (i.e., low-resolution). This fringe extends out to a specified area, and the cut-off is called the margin.

The second model is called the zoom-lens model and was first introduced in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eriksen | first1 = C | last2 = St James | first2 = J | year = 1986 | title = Visual attention within and around the field of focal attention: A zoom lens model |journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 225–40 |pmid=3786090 | doi = 10.3758/BF03211502}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model inherits all properties of the spotlight model (i.e., the focus, the fringe, and the margin), but it has the added property of changing in size. This size-change mechanism was inspired by the [[zoom lens]] one might find on a camera, and any change in size can be described by a trade-off in the efficiency of processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0001-6918(90)90022-8 | last1 = Castiello | first1 = U | last2 = Umilta | first2 = C | year = 1990 | title = Size of the attentional focus and efficiency of processing | journal = Acta Psychologica | volume = 73 | issue = 3| pages = 195–209 | pmid = 2353586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The zoom-lens of attention can be described in terms of an inverse trade-off between the size of focus and the efficiency of processing: because attentional resources are assumed to be fixed, then it follows that the larger the focus is, the slower processing will be of that region of the visual scene, since this fixed resource will be distributed over a larger area. It is thought that the focus of attention can subtend a minimum of 1° of [[visual angle]],&lt;ref name="Eriksen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eriksen | first1 = CW | last2 = Hoffman | first2 = JE | year = 1973 | title = The extent of processing of noise elements during selective encoding from visual displays | url = http://www.psychonomic.org/backissues/21786//pp/vol14-1/pp-14-155.pdf | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 155–160 | doi = 10.3758/BF03198630 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; however the maximum size has not yet been determined.

A significant debate emerged in the last decade of the 20th century in which Treisman's 1993 Feature Integration Theory (FIT) was compared to Duncan and Humphrey's 1989 attentional engagement theory (AET).&lt;ref name=r5&gt;[[#Raftopoulos|Raftopoulos]], pp. 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt; FIT posits that "objects are retrieved from scenes by means of selective spatial attention that picks out objects' features, forms feature maps, and integrates those features that are found at the same location into forming objects." Duncan and Humphrey's AET understanding of attention maintained that "there is an initial pre-attentive parallel phase of perceptual segmentation and analysis that encompasses all of the visual items present in a scene. At this phase, descriptions of the objects in a visual scene are generated into structural units; the outcome of this parallel phase is a multiple-spatial-scale structured representation. Selective attention intervenes after this stage to select information that will be entered into visual short-term memory."&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; The contrast of the two theories placed a new emphasis on the separation of visual attention tasks alone and those mediated by supplementary cognitive processes. As Rastophopoulos summarizes the debate: "Against Treisman's FIT, which posits spatial attention as a necessary condition for detection of objects, Humphreys argues that visual elements are encoded and bound together in an initial parallel phase without focal attention, and that attention serves to select among the objects that result from this initial grouping."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Raftopoulos|Raftopoulos]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuropsychological model==
In the twentieth century, the pioneering research of Lev Vygotsky and Alexander Luria led to the three-part model of neuropsychology defining the working brain as being represented by three co-active processes listed as Attention, Memory, and Activation. Attention is identified as one of the three major co-active processes of the working brain. A.R. Luria published his well-known book ''The Working Brain'' in 1973 as a concise adjunct volume to his previous 1962 book ''Higher Cortical Functions in Man''. In this volume, Luria summarized his three-part global theory of the working brain as being composed of three constantly co-active processes which he described as the; (1) Attention system, (2) Mnestic (memory) system, and (3) Cortical activation system. The two books together are considered by Homskaya's account as "among Luria's major works in neuropsychology, most fully reflecting all the aspects (theoretical, clinical, experimental) of this new discipline."&lt;ref&gt;Homskaya, Elena, ''A.R. Luria'', Plenum Press, pp 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; The product of the combined research of Vygotsky and Luria have determined a large part of the contemporary understanding and definition of attention as it is understood at the start of the 21st-century.

== Multitasking and divided ==
{{see also|Human multitasking|Distracted driving}}

Multitasking can be defined as the attempt to perform two or more tasks simultaneously; however, research shows that when multitasking, people make more mistakes or perform their tasks more slowly.&lt;ref name=Matlin&gt;{{cite book|title=Cognition|year=2013|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-14896-9|author=Margaret W. Matlin|edition=8|type=Textbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Attention must be divided among all of the component tasks to perform them.  In divided attention, individuals attend or give attention to multiple sources of information at once at the same time or perform more than one task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Attention|last=Gopher|first=D|last2=Iani|first2=C|date=2005|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/wileycs/attention/0|publisher=Encyclopedia of cognitive science|access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Older research involved looking at the limits of people performing simultaneous tasks like reading stories, while listening and writing something else,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Spelke, Hirst, &amp; Neisser|title=Skills of divided attention|journal=Cognition|year=1976|volume=4|issue=3|pages=215–230|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(76)90018-4|url=https://www.msu.edu/~ema/802/Ch3-4-SpelkeEtAl75.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; or listening to two separate messages through different ears (i.e., [[dichotic listening]]).  Generally, classical research into attention investigated the ability of people to learn new information when there were multiple tasks to be performed, or to probe the limits of our perception (c.f. [[Donald Broadbent]]).  There is also older literature on people's performance on multiple tasks performed simultaneously, such as driving a car while tuning a radio&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=I. D.|title=Effect of a car radio on driving in traffic|journal=Ergonomics|year=1965|volume=8|issue=4|pages=475–479|doi=10.1080/00140136508930828|pmid=5854152}}&lt;/ref&gt; or driving while telephoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=ID|last2=Tickner |first2= AH |last3= Simmonds |first3= DC |title=Interference between concurrent tasks of driving and telephoning|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|year=1969|volume=53|issue=5|pages=419–24|doi=10.1037/h0028103|pmid=5366314|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/apl/53/5/419/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of current research on human multitasking is based on performance of doing two tasks simultaneously,&lt;ref name ="Matlin"/&gt; usually that involves driving while performing another task, such as texting, eating, or even speaking to passengers in the vehicle, or with a friend over a cellphone.  This research reveals that the human attentional system has limits for what it can process: driving performance is worse while engaged in other tasks; drivers make more mistakes, brake harder and later, get into more accidents, veer into other lanes, and/or are less aware of their surroundings when engaged in the previously discussed tasks.&lt;ref name="Strahhh &amp; Drews 2007"&gt;{{cite book|title=Attention: From Theory to Practice|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=121–33|last=Strayer |first= D.

There has been little difference found between speaking on a hands-free cell phone or a hand-held cell phone,&lt;ref name="Chabris &amp; Simmons, 2010"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Invisible Gorilla and Other Ways Our Intuitions Deceive Us|year=2010|publisher=Crown|location=New York|author=Chabris|edition=C.

L.|chapter=Attention: Divided|editor=E. B. Goldstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that it is the strain of attentional system that causes problems, rather than what the driver is doing with his or her hands.  While speaking with a passenger is as cognitively demanding as speaking with a friend over the phone,&lt;ref name="Strayer et al. 2012"&gt;{{cite web |title= Measuring Cognitive Distraction in the Automobile |date= June 2013 |url= https://www.aaafoundation.org/sites/default/files/MeasuringCognitiveDistractions.pdf |publisher= AAA |first1= DL |last1= Strayer |first2= JM |last2= Cooper |first3= J |last3= Turrill |first4= J |last4= Coleman |first5= N |last5= Medeiros-Ward |first6= F |last6= Biond |displayauthors= 4 |type= Research Report |access-date= 2013-11-06 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131028233322/https://www.aaafoundation.org/sites/default/files/MeasuringCognitiveDistractions.pdf |archive-date= 2013-10-28 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; passengers are able to change the conversation based upon the needs of the driver.  For example, if traffic intensifies, a passenger may stop talking to allow the driver to navigate the increasingly difficult roadway; a conversation partner over a phone would not be aware of the change in environment.

There have been multiple theories regarding divided attention. One, conceived by [[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman]],&lt;ref name="Attention &amp; Effort"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|title=Attention and Effort|year=1973|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/docs/attention_and_effort/Attention_lo_quality.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains that there is a single pool of attentional resources that can be freely divided among multiple tasks. This model seems to be too oversimplified, however, due to the different modalities (e.g., visual, auditory, verbal) that are perceived.&lt;ref name="Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1133313915|author=Sternberg, Robert J.|author2=Sternberg, Karin|type=Textbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the two simultaneous tasks use the same modality, such as listening to a radio station and writing a paper, it is much more difficult to concentrate on both because the tasks are likely to interfere with each other. The specific modality model was theorized by Navon and Gopher in 1979. However, more recent research using well controlled dual-task paradigms points at the importance of tasks.&lt;ref name="Wahn &amp; König 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wahn|first= B |title=Is attentional resource allocation across sensory modalities task-dependent? |journal=Front Psychol | year=2017 | volume=13 |issue= 1 | pages=83–96 | doi=10.5709/acp-0209-2 | pmid=28450975 | last2=König | first2=P | pmc=5405449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, in spatial visual-auditory &lt;ref name="Wahn &amp; König 2015a"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wahn|first= B |title=Audition and vision share spatial attentional resources, yet attentional load does not disrupt audiovisual integration. |journal=Front Psychol  | year=2015 | volume=6 | pages=1084 | doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01084 | pmid=26284008 | last2=König | first2=P | pmc=4518141}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in spatial visual-tactile tasks &lt;ref name="Wahn &amp; König 2015b"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wahn|first= B |title=Vision and haptics share spatial attentional resources and visuotactile integration is not affected by high attentional load. |journal=Multisens Res  | year=2015 | volume=28 |issue= 3–4 | pages=371–392 | doi=10.1163/22134808-00002482 | pmid=26288905 | last2=König | first2=P }}&lt;/ref&gt; interference of the two tasks is observed. In contrast, when one of the tasks involves object detection, no interference is observed.&lt;ref name="Wahn &amp; König 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wahn|first= B |title=Attentional resource allocation in visuotactile processing depends on the task, but optimal visuotactile integration does not depend on attentional resources. |journal=Front Integr Neurosci   | year=2016 | volume=10 | pages=13 | doi=10.3389/fnint.2016.00013 | pmid=27013994 | last2=König | first2=P | pmc=4781873}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the multi-modal advantage in attentional resources is task dependent.

As an alternative, resource theory has been proposed as a more accurate metaphor for explaining divided attention on complex tasks. Resource theory states that as each complex task is automatized, performing that task requires less of the individual's limited-capacity attentional resources.&lt;ref name="Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012"/&gt; Other variables play a part in our ability to pay attention to and concentrate on many tasks at once. These include, but are not limited to, anxiety, arousal, task difficulty, and skills.&lt;ref name="Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012"/&gt;

==Simultaneous==
Simultaneous attention is a type of attention, classified by attending to multiple events at the same time. Simultaneous attention is demonstrated by children in Indigenous communities, who [[Observational Learning#Indigenous communities of the Americas|learn]] through this type of attention to their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Correa-Chávez|first1=M|last2=Roberts|first2=ALD |last3= Pérez |first3= MM |title=Cultural patterns in children's learning through keen observation and participation in their communities|pmid=21887963|journal=Advances in Child Development|year=2011|volume=40|pages=209–41|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-386491-8.00006-2|isbn=9780123864918}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneous attention is present in the ways in which children of indigenous backgrounds interact both with their surroundings and with other individuals. Simultaneous attention requires focus on multiple simultaneous activities or occurrences. This differs from multitasking, which is characterized by alternating attention and focus between multiple activities, or halting one activity before switching to the next.

Simultaneous attention involves uninterrupted attention to several activities occurring at the same time. Another cultural practice that may relate to simultaneous attention strategies is coordination within a group. Indigenous heritage toddlers and caregivers in San Pedro were observed to frequently coordinate their activities with other members of a group in ways parallel to a model of simultaneous attention, whereas middle-class European-descent families in the U.S. would move back and forth between events.&lt;ref name="Chavajay 1999 1079–1090"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morelli&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morelli|first=G |first2=Angelillo |last2= C |doi=10.1080/01650250244000335|title=Cultural variation in young children's access to work or involvement in specialized child-focused activities|url=http://people.ucsc.edu/~brogoff/Psych247articles/Morelli%20et%20al%20Cultural%20Var%20in%20Young%20Children%27s%20Access.pdf|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Development|year=2003|volume=27|issue=3|pages=264–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research concludes that children with close ties to Indigenous American roots have a high tendency to be especially wide, keen observers.&lt;ref name="Silva 2010 898–912"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silva|first=KG |last2= Correa-Chavez |first2= M |last3=Rogoff |first3= B |title=Mexican-heritage children's attention and  learning from interactions directed to others|journal=Child Development|year=2010|volume=81|issue=3|pages=898–912|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01441.x|pmid=20573112}}&lt;/ref&gt; This points to a strong cultural difference in attention management.

==Alternative topics and discussions==

===Overt and covert orienting===
Attention may be differentiated into "overt" versus "covert" orienting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Wright |first1= R.D. |last2= Ward |first2= L.M. |year= 2008 |title= Orienting of Attention |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Overt orienting'' is the act of selectively attending to an item or location over others by moving the eyes to point in that direction.&lt;ref name="Posner, M. I. 1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Posner |first= MI |year=1980|title= Orienting of attention|journal= Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume= 32|issue=1|pages= 3–25|pmid=7367577|url=http://psych.unl.edu/mdodd/Psy498/Posner.pdf|doi=10.1080/00335558008248231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overt orienting can be directly observed in the form of eye movements. Although overt eye movements are quite common, there is a distinction that can be made between two types of eye movements; reflexive and controlled. Reflexive movements are commanded by the [[superior colliculus]] of the [[midbrain]]. These movements are fast and are activated by the sudden appearance of stimuli. In contrast, controlled eye movements are commanded by areas in the [[frontal lobe]]. These movements are slow and voluntary.

''Covert orienting'' is the act to mentally shifting one's focus without moving one's eyes.&lt;ref name="Eriksen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Posner, M. I. 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3758/BF03207451|title=Selective attention and serial processing in briefly presented visual displays|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|volume=10|issue=5|pages=321–326|year=1971|last1=Eriksen|first1= CW |last2= Colegate |first2= RL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply, it is changes in attention that are not attributable to overt eye movements. Covert orienting has the potential to affect the output of perceptual processes by governing attention to particular items or locations (for example, the activity of a V4 neuron whose receptive field lies on an attended stimuli will be enhanced by covert attention)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gregoriou |first1= GG |title= High-frequency, long-range coupling between prefrontal and visual cortex during attention |journal= Science |volume= 324 |issue= 5931 |year= 2009 |pages= 1207–10 |pmid= 19478185|doi= 10.1126/science.1171402 |bibcode=2009Sci...324.1207G |pmc=2849291}}&lt;/ref&gt; but does not influence the information that is processed by the senses. Researchers often use "filtering" tasks to study the role of covert attention of selecting information. These tasks often require participants to observe a number of stimuli, but attend to only one.&lt;br /&gt; The current view is that visual covert attention is a mechanism for quickly scanning the field of view for interesting locations. This shift in covert attention is linked to eye movement circuitry that sets up a slower [[saccade]] to that location.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

There are studies that suggest the mechanisms of overt and covert orienting may not be controlled separately and independently as previously believed. Central mechanisms that may control covert orienting, such as the parietal lobe, also receive input from subcortical centres involved in overt orienting.&lt;ref name="Posner, M. I. 1980"/&gt; In support of this, general theories of attention actively assume bottom-up (reflexive) processes and top-down (voluntary) processes converge on a common neural architecture, in that they control both covert and overt attentional systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hunt | first1 = A.

===Exogenous and endogenous orienting===
Orienting attention is vital and can be controlled through external (exogenous) or internal (endogenous) processes.  However, comparing these two processes is challenging because external signals do not operate completely exogenously, but will only summon attention and eye movements if they are important to the subject.&lt;ref name="Posner, M. I. 1980"/&gt;

''Exogenous'' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''exo'', meaning "outside", and ''genein'', meaning "to produce") orienting is frequently described as being under control of a stimulus.&lt;ref name="Mayer, A. R. 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Dorflinger | first2 = J. M. | last3 = Rao | first3 = S.

This often results in a reflexive saccade. Since exogenous cues are typically presented in the periphery, they are referred to as ''peripheral cues''. Exogenous orienting can even be observed when individuals are aware that the cue will not relay reliable, accurate information about where a target is going to occur. This means that the mere presence of an exogenous cue will affect the response to other stimuli that are subsequently presented in the cue's previous location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/users/ferber/teaching/visualattention/readings/Oct6/1998_Friesen_Kingstone_PBR.pdf|doi=10.3758/BF03208827|title=The eyes have it!

Several studies have investigated the influence of valid and invalid cues.&lt;ref name="Posner, M. I. 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=1775667|year=1991|author1=Cheal|first1=M|title=Central and peripheral precuing of forced-choice discrimination|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology: A, Human Experimental Psychology|volume=43|issue=4|pages=859–80|last2=Lyon|first2=DR |doi=10.1080/14640749108400960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonides, J.

Posner and Cohen (1984) noted a reversal of this benefit takes place when the interval between the onset of the cue and the onset of the target is longer than about 300 ms.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, M.I., &amp; Cohen, Y.P.C. (1984) "Components of visual orienting". In H. Bouma &amp; D. Bouwhuis (Eds.), ''Attention and performance X'' (pp. 531–566). London: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon  of valid cues producing longer reaction times than invalid cues is called [[inhibition of return]].

''Endogenous'' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''endo'', meaning "within" or "internally") orienting is the intentional allocation of attentional resources to a predetermined location or space.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Mayer, A.R. 2004" /&gt; ???--&gt; Simply stated, endogenous orienting occurs when attention is oriented according to an observer's goals or desires, allowing the focus of attention to be manipulated by the demands of a task. In order to have an effect, endogenous cues must be processed by the observer and acted upon purposefully. These cues are frequently referred to as ''central cues''. This is because they are typically presented at the center of a display, where an observer's eyes are likely to be fixated. Central cues, such as an arrow or digit presented at fixation, tell observers to attend to a specific location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hodgson | first1 = T.

When examining differences between exogenous and endogenous orienting, some researchers suggest that there are four differences between the two kinds of cues: 
* exogenous orienting is less affected by [[cognitive load]] than endogenous orienting; 
* observers are able to ignore endogenous cues but not exogenous cues;
* exogenous cues have bigger effects than endogenous cues; and
* expectancies about cue validity and predictive value affects endogenous orienting more than exogenous orienting.&lt;ref&gt;Jonides, J. (1981).

There exist both overlaps and differences in the areas of the brain that are responsible for endogenous and exogenous orientating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rosen | first1 = A.

Researchers of this school have described two different aspects of how the mind focuses attention to items present in the environment. The first aspect is called bottom-up processing, also known as stimulus-driven attention or [[exogeny|exogenous]] attention. These describe attentional processing which is driven by the properties of the objects themselves. Some processes, such as motion or a sudden loud noise, can attract our attention in a pre-conscious, or non-volitional way. We attend to them whether we want to or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=2011456|year=1991|author1=Theeuwes|first1=J|title=Exogenous and endogenous control of attention: The effect of visual onsets and offsets|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|volume=49|issue=1|pages=83–90|doi=10.3758/bf03211619}}&lt;/ref&gt; These aspects of attention are thought to involve [[parietal lobe|parietal]] and [[temporal lobe|temporal]] cortices, as well as the [[brainstem]].&lt;ref name="Posner"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=2183676|url=http://cns-web.bu.edu/Profiles/Mingolla.html/cnsftp/cn730-2007-pdf/posner_petersen90.pdf|year=1990|author1=Posner|first1=M.

The second aspect is called top-down processing, also known as goal-driven, [[endogeny|endogenous]] attention, [[Attentional Control|attentional control]] or [[executive functions|executive]] attention.

The perceptual considers the subject’s ability to perceive or ignore stimuli, both task-related and non task-related. Studies show that if there are many stimuli present (especially if they are task-related), it is much easier to ignore the non-task related stimuli, but if there are few stimuli the mind will perceive the irrelevant stimuli as well as the relevant. The cognitive refers to the actual processing of the stimuli. Studies regarding this showed that the ability to process stimuli decreased with age, meaning that younger people were able to perceive more stimuli and fully process them, but were likely to process both relevant and irrelevant information, while older people could process fewer stimuli, but usually processed only relevant information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lavie |first1=Nilli |last2=Hirst |first2=Aleksandra |last3=de Fockert |first3=Jan W. |last4=Viding |first4=Essi |year=2004 |title=Load theory of selective attention and cognitive control |url=http://www.icn.ucl.ac.uk/lavielab/reprints/Lavie-etal-04.pdf |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology |pages=339–54 |volume=133 |issue=3 |pmid=15355143 |doi=10.1037/0096-3445.133.3.339 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626052615/http://www.icn.ucl.ac.uk/lavielab/reprints/lavie-etal-04.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people can process multiple stimuli, e.g. trained morse code operators have been able to copy 100% of a message while carrying on a meaningful conversation.  This relies on the reflexive response due to "overlearning" the skill of morse code reception/detection/transcription so that it is an autonomous function requiring no specific attention to perform.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Clinical model===
Attention is best described as the sustained focus of cognitive resources on information while filtering or ignoring extraneous information. Attention is a very basic function that often is a precursor to all other neurological/cognitive functions. As is frequently the case, clinical models of attention differ from investigation models. One of the most used models for the evaluation of attention in patients with very different [[neurologic]] pathologies is the model of Sohlberg and Mateer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=McKay Moore Sohlberg |author2=Catherine A. Mateer |title=Introduction to cognitive rehabilitation: theory and practice |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-89862-738-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hierarchic model is based in the recovering of attention processes of [[brain damage]] patients after [[coma]]. Five different kinds of activities of growing difficulty are described in the model; connecting with the activities those patients could do as their recovering process advanced.
* '''Focused attention:''' The ability to respond discretely to specific visual, [[Auditory spatial attention|auditory]] or tactile stimuli.
* '''Sustained attention ([[Vigilance Theory|vigilance]] and [[attentional control|concentration]]):''' The ability to maintain a consistent behavioral response during continuous and repetitive activity.
* '''Selective attention:''' The ability to maintain a behavioral or cognitive set in the face of distracting or competing stimuli. Therefore, it incorporates the notion of "freedom from distractibility."
* '''Alternating attention:''' The ability of mental flexibility that allows individuals to shift their focus of attention and move between tasks having different cognitive requirements.
* '''Divided attention:''' This refers to the ability to respond simultaneously to multiple tasks or multiple task demands.

This model has been shown to be very useful in evaluating attention in very different pathologies, correlates strongly with daily difficulties and is especially helpful in designing stimulation programs such as attention process training, a rehabilitation program for neurological patients of the same authors.
* '''[[Mindfulness]]:'''  Mindfulness has been conceptualized as a clinical model of attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carmody|first=James|date=2009|title=Evolving Conceptions of Mindfulness in Clinical Settings|url=|journal=Journal of Cognitive Therapy; New York|volume=23 | issue = 3 |pages=270–280|via=|doi=10.1891/0889-8391.23.3.270}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mindfulness]] practices are clinical interventions that emphasize training attention functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kabat-Zinn|first=Jon|date=2015|title=Mindfulness|url=|journal=Mindfulness|volume=6 | issue = 6 |pages=1481–1483|via=|doi=10.1007/s12671-015-0456-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neural correlates===
Most experiments show that one [[neural correlate]] of attention is enhanced firing. If a neuron has a certain response to a stimulus when the animal is not attending to the stimulus, then when the animal does attend to the stimulus, the neuron's response will be enhanced even if the physical characteristics of the stimulus remain the same.

In a 2007 review, Knudsen&lt;ref name="Knudsen"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Knudsen, Eric I |title=Fundamental Components of Attention |journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=57–78 |year= 2007 |pmid=17417935 |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.30.051606.094256}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes a more general [[Conceptual model|model]] which identifies four core processes of attention, with [[working memory]] at the center:
* [[Working memory]] temporarily stores information for detailed analysis.
* Competitive selection is the process that determines which information gains access to working memory.
* Through top-down sensitivity control, higher cognitive processes can regulate signal intensity in information channels that compete for access to working memory, and thus give them an advantage in the process of competitive selection. Through top-down sensitivity control, the momentary content of working memory can influence the selection of new information, and thus mediate voluntary control of attention in a recurrent loop (endogenous attention).&lt;ref name="Pattyn"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.physbeh.2007.09.016 | pmid = 17999934 | last1 = Pattyn | first1 = N. | last2 = Neyt | first2 = X. | last3 = Henderickx | first3 = D. | last4 = Soetens | first4 = E. | year = 2008 | title = Psychophysiological Investigation of Vigilance Decrement: Boredom or Cognitive Fatigue? | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 93 | pages = 369–378 | issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bottom-up saliency filters automatically enhance the response to infrequent stimuli, or stimuli of instinctive or learned biological relevance (exogenous attention).&lt;ref name="Pattyn"/&gt;

Neurally, at different hierarchical levels spatial maps can enhance or inhibit activity in sensory areas, and induce orienting behaviors like eye movement.
* At the top of the hierarchy, the [[frontal eye fields]] (FEF) and the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] contain a retinocentric spatial map. [[Microstimulation]] in the FEF induces monkeys to make a [[saccade]] to the relevant location. Stimulation at levels too low to induce a saccade will nonetheless enhance cortical responses to stimuli located in the relevant area.
* At the next lower level, a variety of spatial maps are found in the [[parietal cortex]]. In particular, the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) contains a saliency map and is interconnected both with the FEF and with sensory areas.
* Certain automatic responses that influence attention, like orienting to a highly salient stimulus, are mediated subcortically by the [[superior colliculi]].
* At the neural network level, it is thought that processes like [[lateral inhibition]] mediate the process of competitive selection.

In many cases attention produces changes in the [[EEG]]. Many animals, including humans, produce [[gamma wave]]s (40–60&amp;nbsp;Hz) when focusing attention on a particular object or activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Kaiser J, Lutzenberger W |title=Induced gamma-band activity and human brain function |journal=Neuroscientist |volume=9 |pages=475–84 |year=2003 |pmid=14678580 |doi=10.1177/1073858403259137 |issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Siegel M, Donner TH, Oostenveld R, Fries P, Engel AK |title=Neuronal synchronization along the dorsal visual pathway reflects the focus of spatial attention |journal=[[Neuron (journal)|Neuron]] |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=709–719 |date=Mar 2008 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2008.09.010 |pmid=19038226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gregoriou GG, Gotts SJ, Zhou H, Desimone R |title=High-frequency, long-range coupling between prefrontal and visual cortex during attention |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=324 |issue=5931 |pages=1207–1210 |date=Mar 2009 |doi=10.1126/science.1171402 |bibcode=2009Sci...324.1207G |pmid=19478185 |pmc=2849291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baldauf D, Desimone R |title=Neural mechanisms of object-based attention |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=344 |issue=6182 |pages=424–427 |date=Mar 2014 |pmid=24763592 |doi=10.1126/science.1247003 |bibcode=2014Sci...344..424B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another commonly used model for the attention system has been put forth by researchers such as [[Michael Posner (psychologist)|Michael Posner]].

* Orienting is the directing of attention to a specific stimulus.
* Executive attention is used when there is a conflict between multiple attention cues. It is essentially the same as the [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Central executive|central executive]] in [[Baddeley's model of working memory]].

===Cultural variation===
Children appear to develop patterns of attention related to the cultural practices of their families, communities, and the institutions in which they participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Correa-Chavez|first=Maricela|author2=Barbara Rogoff|title=Cultural variation in childrens attention and learning|journal=Psychology and the Real World: Essays Illustrating Fundamental Contributions to Society|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, [[Jules Henry]] suggested that there are societal differences in sensitivity to signals from many ongoing sources that call for the awareness of several levels of attention simultaneously. He tied his speculation to ethnographic observations of communities in which children are involved in a complex social community with multiple relationships.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chavajay|first=Pablo|title=Cultural variation in management of attention by children and their caregivers|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1999|volume=35|issue=4|pages=1079–1090|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.35.4.1079|pmid=10442876|last2=Rogoff|first2=Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous children in the Americas]] predominantly learn by [[Observational Learning|observing]] and pitching in. There are several studies to support that the use of keen attention towards learning is much more common in Indigenous Communities of North and Central America than in a middle-class European-American setting.&lt;ref name="Rogoff 2011 1–18"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogoff|first=Barbara|author2=Correa-Chavez, M. |author3=Silva, K. G. |title=Cultural variation in children's attention  and learning|journal=Psychology and the Real World: Essays Illustrating Fundamental Contributions to Society|date=2011|pages=1–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a direct result of the [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In]] model.

Keen attention is both a requirement and result of learning by observing and pitching-in. Incorporating the children in the community gives them the opportunity to keenly observe and contribute to activities that were not directed towards them. It can be seen from different Indigenous communities and cultures, such as the [[Mayans]] of [[San Pedro La Laguna|San Pedro]], that children can simultaneously attend to multiple events.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Most [[Maya peoples|Maya]] children have learned to pay attention to several events at once in order to make useful observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogoff|first1=Barbara|title=The Cultural Nature of Human Development|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195131338|date=2003-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example is simultaneous attention which involves uninterrupted attention to several activities occurring at the same time. Another cultural practice that may relate to simultaneous attention strategies is coordination within a group. San Pedro toddlers and caregivers frequently coordinated their activities with other members of a group in multiway engagements rather than in a dyadic fashion.&lt;ref name="Chavajay 1999 1079–1090"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morelli/&gt; Research concludes that children with close ties to Indigenous American roots have a high tendency to be especially keen observers.&lt;ref name="Silva 2010 898–912"/&gt;

This learning by observing and pitching-in model requires active levels of attention management. The child is present while caretakers engage in daily activities and responsibilities such as: weaving, farming, and other skills necessary for survival. Being present allows the child to focus their attention on the actions being performed by their parents, elders, and/or older siblings.&lt;ref name="Rogoff 2011 1–18"/&gt; In order to learn in this way, keen attention and focus is required. Eventually the child is expected to be able to perform these skills themselves.

===Modelling===

In the domain of [[computer vision]], efforts have been made to model the mechanism of human attention, especially the bottom-up intentional mechanism&lt;ref name="Li J, Levine MD, An X, Xu X, He H 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Li J, Levine MD, An X, Xu X, He H |title=Visual Saliency Based on Scale-Space Analysis in the Frequency Domain |journal=IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell|volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=996–1010 |year=2012|doi=10.1109/TPAMI.2012.147|pmid=22802112 |arxiv=1605.01999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its semantic significance in classification of video contents.&lt;ref name="Zang Wang Liu Zhang 2018 pp. 97–108"&gt;{{cite book | last=Zang | first=Jinliang | last2=Wang | first2=Le | last3=Liu | first3=Ziyi | last4=Zhang | first4=Qilin | last5=Hua | first5=Gang | last6=Zheng | first6=Nanning | title=IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology | chapter=Attention-Based Temporal Weighted Convolutional Neural Network for Action Recognition | publisher=Springer International Publishing | location=Cham | year=2018 | isbn=978-3-319-92006-1 | issn=1868-4238 | doi=10.1007/978-3-319-92007-8_9 | pages=97–108 | arxiv=1803.07179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang Zang Zhang Niu p=1979"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wang | first=Le | last2=Zang | first2=Jinliang | last3=Zhang | first3=Qilin | last4=Niu | first4=Zhenxing | last5=Hua | first5=Gang | last6=Zheng | first6=Nanning | title=Action Recognition by an Attention-Aware Temporal Weighted Convolutional Neural Network | journal=Sensors | volume=18 | issue=7 | date=2018-06-21 | issn=1424-8220 | doi=10.3390/s18071979 | pmid=29933555 | pmc=6069475 | page=1979 | url=https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/sensors-18-01979-Action_Recognition_by_an_Attention-Aware_Temporal_Weighted_Convolutional_Neural_Network.pdf | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Visual spatial attention|spatial attention]] and [[Visual temporal attention|temporal attention]] have been incorporated in such classification efforts.

Generally speaking, there are two kinds of models to mimic the bottom-up salience mechanism in static images. One way is based on the spatial contrast analysis. For example, a center–surround mechanism has been used to define salience across scales, inspired by the putative neural mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Laurent Itti |author2=Christof Koch |author3=Ernst Niebur |title=A Model of Saliency-Based Visual Attention for Rapid Scene Analysis |journal=IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell|volume=20 |issue=11 |pages=1254–1259 |year=1998|doi=10.1109/34.730558 |citeseerx=10.1.1.53.2366 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been hypothesized that some visual inputs are intrinsically salient in certain background contexts and that these are actually task-independent. This model has established itself as the exemplar for salience detection and consistently used for comparison in the literature;&lt;ref name="Li J, Levine MD, An X, Xu X, He H 2012"/&gt; the other way is based on the frequency domain analysis. This method was first proposed by Hou et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Hou X, Zhang L |doi=10.1109/CVPR.2007.383267 |url=http://www.klab.caltech.edu/~xhou/papers/cvpr07.pdf |access-date=2015-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212171627/http://www.klab.caltech.edu/~xhou/papers/cvpr07.pdf |archive-date=2015-02-12 |dead-url=yes |df= |title=2007 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition |pages=1–8 |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4244-1179-5 |chapter=Saliency Detection: A Spectral Residual Approach |citeseerx=10.1.1.579.1650 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this method was called SR, and then PQFT method was also introduced. Both SR and PQFT only use the phase information.&lt;ref name="Li J, Levine MD, An X, Xu X, He H 2012"/&gt; In 2012, the HFT method was introduced, and both the amplitude and the phase information are made use of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li J, Levine MD, An X, Xu X, He H |title=Visual Saliency Based on Scale-Space Analysis in the Frequency Domain |journal=IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=996–1010 |year=2012 |doi=10.1109/TPAMI.2012.147 |pmid=22802112 |url=http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~lijian/06243147.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301015810/http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~lijian/06243147.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-01 |df= |arxiv=1605.01999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hemispatial neglect===
{{Main|Hemispatial neglect}}
Hemispatial neglect, also called ''unilateral neglect'', often occurs when people have damage to their right hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Kalat, J. W. 2013"&gt;Kalat, J. W. (2013). ''Biological Psychology (11th ed''.). Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; This damage often leads to a tendency to ignore the left side of one's body or even the left side of an object that can be seen. Damage to the left side of the brain (the left hemisphere) rarely yields significant neglect of the right side of the body or object in the person's local environments.&lt;ref name="Silveri, M. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=21639641|year=2011|author1=Silveri|first1=M. C.|title=Unilateral spatial neglect in degenerative brain pathology|journal=Neuropsychology|volume=25|issue=5|pages=554–66|last2=Ciccarelli|first2=N|last3=Cappa|first3=A|doi=10.1037/a0023957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of spatial neglect, however, may vary and differ depending on what area of the brain was damaged. Damage to different neural substrates can result in different types of neglect. Attention disorders (lateralized and nonlaterized) may also contribute to the symptoms and effects.&lt;ref name="Silveri, M. 2011"/&gt; Much research has asserted that damage to gray matter within the brain results in spatial neglect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19168667|pmc=2742593|year=2009|author1=Karnath|first1=H. O.|title=Damage to white matter fiber tracts in acute spatial neglect|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=19|issue=10|pages=2331–7|last2=Rorden|first2=C|last3=Ticini|first3=L. F.|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhn250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New technology has yielded more information, such that there is a large, distributed network of frontal, parietal, temporal, and subcortical brain areas that have been tied to neglect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Buxbaum L. J. | year = 2006 | title = On the right (and left) track: Twenty years of progress in studying hemispatial neglect | url = | journal = Cognitive Neuropsychology | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 184–201 | doi=10.1080/02643290500202698| pmid = 21049327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This network can be related to other research as well; the [[dorsal attention network]] is tied to spatial orienting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20861361|year=2010|author1=Ptak|first1=R|title=The dorsal attention network mediates orienting toward behaviorally relevant stimuli in spatial neglect|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=30|issue=38|pages=12557–65|last2=Schnider|first2=A|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2722-10.2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of damage to this network may result in patients neglecting their left side when distracted about their right side or an object on their right side.&lt;ref name="Kalat, J. W. 2013"/&gt;

===Attention in social contexts===

'''Social attention''' is one special form of attention that involves the allocation of limited processing resources in a social context. Previous studies on social attention often regard how attention is directed toward socially relevant stimuli such as faces and gaze directions of other individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=J. T.|last2=Shepherd|first2=S. V.|last3=Platt|first3=M. L.|title=Social attention and the brain|journal=Current Biology|date=2009|volume=19|issue=20|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.08.010|pmid=19889376|pmc=3387539|pages=R958–R962|bibcode=1996CBio....6.1213A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to attending-to-others, a different line of researches has shown that self-related information such as own face and name automatically captures attention and is preferentially processed comparing to other-related information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Humphreys|first1=G. W.|last2=Sui|first2=J.|title=Attentional control and the self: the Self-Attention Network (SAN)|journal=Cognitive Neuroscience|date=2016|volume=21|issue=1–4|doi=10.1080/17588928.2015.1044427|pmid=25945926|pages=5–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; These contrasting effects between attending-to-others and attending-to-self prompt a synthetic view in a recent Opinion article &lt;ref name="journal.frontiersin.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuang|first1=S.|title=Two Polarities of Attention in Social Contexts: From Attending-to-Others to Attending-to-Self|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=2016|volume=7|page=63|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00063|pmid=26869965|pmc=4734343}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposing that social attention operates at two polarizing states: In one extreme, individual tends to attend to the self and prioritize self-related information over others', and, in the other extreme, attention is allocated to other individuals to infer their intentions and desires. Attending-to-self and attending-to-others mark the two ends of an otherwise continuum spectrum of social attention. For a given behavioral context, the mechanisms underlying these two polarities might interact and compete with each other in order to determine a saliency map of social attention that guides our behaviors.&lt;ref name="journal.frontiersin.org"/&gt; An imbalanced competition between these two behavioral and cognitive processes will cause cognitive disorders and neurological symptoms such as [[autism spectrum]] disorders and [[Williams syndrome]].

==History of the study==

===Philosophical period===
Psychologist [[Daniel Berlyne|Daniel E. Berlyne]] credits the first extended treatment of attention to philosopher [[Nicolas Malebranche]] in his work "The Search After Truth". "Malebranche held that we have access to ideas, or mental representations  of the external world, but not direct access to the world itself."&lt;ref name="Johnson 2004 1–24"/&gt; Thus in order to keep these ideas organized, attention is necessary. Otherwise we will confuse these ideas. Malebranche writes in "The Search After Truth", "because it often happens that the understanding has only confused and imperfect perceptions of things, it is truly a cause of our errors.... It is therefore necessary to look for means to keep our perceptions from being confused and imperfect.  And, because, as everyone knows, there is nothing that makes them clearer and more distinct than attentiveness, we must try to find the means to become more attentive than we are".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malebranche|first=Nicolas|title=The Search After Truth|year=1674|pages=411–412}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Malebranche, attention is crucial to understanding and keeping thoughts organized.

Philosopher [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] introduced the concept of [[apperception]] to this philosophical approach to attention.  Apperception refers to "the process by which new experience is assimilated to and transformed by the residuum of past experience of an individual to form a new whole."&lt;ref&gt;Runes, Dagobert D. (ed.), Dictionary of Philosophy, Littlefield, Adams, and Company, Totowa, NJ, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Apperception is required for a perceived event to become a conscious event. Leibniz emphasized a reflexive involuntary view of attention known as exogenous orienting. However, there is also endogenous orienting which is voluntary and directed attention. Philosopher [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]] agreed with Leibniz's view of apperception; however, he expounded on it in by saying that new experiences had to be tied to ones already existing in the mind. Herbart was also the first person to stress the importance of applying mathematical modeling to the study of psychology.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2004 1–24"/&gt;

In the beginning of the 19th century, it was thought that people were not able to attend to more than one stimulus at a time. However, with research contributions by [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet]] this view was changed.  Hamilton proposed a view of attention that likened its capacity to holding marbles. You can only hold a certain amount of marbles at a time before it starts to spill over. His view states that we can attend to more than one stimulus at once. [[William Stanley Jevons]] later expanded this view and stated that we can attend to up to four items at a time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

During this period of attention, various philosophers made significant contributions to the field. They began the research on the extent of attention and how attention is directed.

===1860–1909===
This period of attention research took the focus from conceptual findings to experimental testing. It also involved psychophysical methods that allowed measurement of the relation between physical stimulus properties and the psychological perceptions of them. This period covers the development of attentional research from the founding of psychology to 1909.

[[Wilhelm Wundt]] introduced the study of attention to the field of psychology. Wundt measured mental processing speed by likening it to differences in stargazing measurements. Astronomers in this time would measure the time it took for stars to travel.  Among these measurements when astronomers recorded the times, there were personal differences in calculation. These different readings resulted in different reports from each astronomer. To correct for this, a [[personal equation]] was developed. Wundt applied this to mental processing speed. Wundt realized that the time it takes to see the stimulus of the star and write down the time was being called an "observation error" but actually was the time it takes to switch voluntarily one's attention from one stimulus to another. Wundt called his school of psychology [[voluntarism (sociology)|voluntarism]]. It was his belief that psychological processes can only be understood in terms of goals and consequences.

[[Franciscus Donders]] used [[mental chronometry]] to study attention and it was considered a major field of intellectual inquiry by authors such as [[Sigmund Freud]]. Donders and his students conducted the first detailed investigations of the speed of mental processes. Donders measured the time required to identify a stimulus and to select a motor response. This was the time difference between stimulus discrimination and response initiation.  Donders also formalized the subtractive method which states that the time for a particular process can be estimated by adding that process to a task and taking the difference in reaction time between the two tasks. He also differentiated between [[Mental chronometry|three types of reactions]]: simple reaction, choice reaction, and go/no-go reaction.

[[Hermann von Helmholtz]] also contributed to the field of attention relating to the extent of attention. Von Helmholtz stated that it is possible to focus on one stimulus and still perceive or ignore others.  An example of this is being able to focus on the letter u in the word house and still perceiving the letters h, o, s, and e.

One major debate in this period was whether it was possible to attend to two things at once (split attention). [[Walter Benjamin]] described this experience as "reception in a state of [[distraction]]." This disagreement could only be resolved through experimentation.

In 1890, [[William James]], in his textbook ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'', remarked:
{{cquote|''Everyone knows what attention is. It is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration, of consciousness are of its essence. It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others, and is a condition which has a real opposite in the confused, dazed, scatterbrained state which in French is called distraction, and Zerstreutheit in German.''&lt;ref&gt;James, W. (1890). ''[[The Principles of Psychology]].'' New York: Henry Holt, Vol. 1, pp. 403–404.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
James differentiated between censorial attention and intellectual attention. Censorial attention is when attention is directed to objects of sense, stimuli that are physically present. Intellectual attention is attention directed to ideal or represented objects; stimuli that are not physically present. James also distinguished between immediate or derived attention: attention to the present versus to something not physically present. According to James, attention has five major effects. Attention works to make us perceive, conceive, distinguish, remember, and shorten reactions time.

===1910–1949===
During this period, research in attention waned and interest in behaviorism flourished, leading some to believe, like [[Ulric Neisser]], that in this period, "There was no research on attention". However, Jersild published very important work on "Mental Set and Shift" in 1927. He stated, "The fact of mental set is primary in all conscious activity.  The same stimulus may evoke any one of a large number of responses depending upon the contextual setting in which it is placed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jersild A.T. |year=1927|title= Mental set and shift|journal= Archives of Psychology|volume=14|issue= 89|pages= 5–82|url=https://archive.org/details/mentalsetshift00jers}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research found that the time to complete a list was longer for mixed lists than for pure lists. For example, if a list was names of animals versus a list with names of animals, books, makes and models of cars, and types of fruits, it takes longer to process. This is [[Task switching (psychology)|task switching]].

In 1931, Telford discovered the [[psychological refractory period]].  The stimulation of neurons is followed by a refractory phase during which neurons are less sensitive to stimulation. In 1935 [[John Ridley Stroop]] developed the Stroop Task which elicited the [[Stroop Effect]]. Stroop's task showed that irrelevant stimulus information can have a major impact on performance.  In this task, subjects were to look at a list of colors. This list of colors had each color typed in a color different from the actual text. For example, the word Blue would be typed in Orange, Pink in Black, and so on.

Example:  '''&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Blue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;Purple&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;Red&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:brown"&gt;Green&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Purple&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:purple"&gt;Green&lt;/span&gt;'''

Subjects were then instructed to say the name of the ink color and ignore the text. It took 110 seconds to complete a list of this type compared to 63 seconds to name the colors when presented in the form of solid squares.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2004 1–24"/&gt; The naming time nearly doubled in the presence  of conflicting color words, an effect known as the Stroop Effect.

===1950–1974===
In the 1950s, [[Psychologist#Research Psychologists|research psychologists]] renewed their interest in attention when the dominant epistemology shifted from positivism (i.e., [[behaviorism]]) to [[philosophical realism|realism]] during what has come to be known as the "[[cognitive revolution]]".&lt;ref&gt;Harré, Rom. ''Cognitive science: A philosophical introduction''. London: SAGE Publications, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7619-4746-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The cognitive revolution admitted unobservable cognitive processes like attention as legitimate objects of scientific study.

Modern research on attention began with the analysis of the "[[cocktail party effect|cocktail party problem]]" by [[Colin Cherry]] in 1953. At a cocktail party how do people select the conversation that they are listening to and ignore the rest? This problem is at times called "focused attention", as opposed to "divided attention". Cherry performed a number of experiments which became known as [[dichotic listening]] and were extended by [[Donald Broadbent]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding cognition'' by Peter J. Hampson, Peter Edwin Morris 1996 {{ISBN|0-631-15751-4}} p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical experiment, subjects would use a set of [[headphones]] to listen to two streams of words in different [[ears]] and selectively attend to one stream. After the task, the experimenter would question the subjects about the content of the unattended stream.

[[Broadbent's Filter Model of Attention]] states that information is held in a pre-attentive temporary store, and only sensory events that have some physical feature in common are selected to pass into the limited capacity processing system.  This implies that the meaning of unattended messages is not identified. Also, a significant amount of time is required to shift the filter from one channel to another. Experiments by Gray and Wedderburn and later [[Anne Treisman]] pointed out various problems in Broadbent's early model and eventually led to the Deutsch–Norman model in 1968. In this model, no signal is filtered out, but all are processed to the point of activating their stored representations in memory. The point at which attention becomes "selective" is when one of the memory representations is selected for further processing. At any time, only one can be selected, resulting in the ''attentional bottleneck''.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding cognition'' by Peter J. Hampson, Peter Edwin Morris 1996 {{ISBN|0-631-15751-4}} pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

This debate became known as the early-selection vs. late-selection models. In the early selection models (first proposed by [[Donald Broadbent]]), attention shuts down (in [[Broadbent's Filter Model of Attention|Broadbent's model]]) or attenuates (in [[Broadbent's Filter Model of Attention#Attenuation model of attention|Triesman's refinement]]) processing in the unattended ear before the mind can analyze its semantic content. In the late selection models (first proposed by J. Anthony Deutsch and [[Diana Deutsch]]), the content in both ears is analyzed semantically, but the words in the unattended ear cannot access consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/h0039515 | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Deutsch | first2 = D. | year = 1963 | title = Attention: some theoretical considerations | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 70 | pages = 80–90 | pmid = 14027390 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lavie's perceptual load theory, however, ‘provided elegant solution to’ what had once been a ‘heated debate’.&lt;ref&gt;J. Theeuwes &amp; A.F. Kramer &amp; A.V. Belopolsky “Attentional set interacts

In the law of the United States, '''attorney–client privilege''' or '''lawyer–client privilege''' is a "client's right privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent any other person from disclosing confidential communications between the client and the attorney."&lt;ref&gt;"Attorney–client privilege", ''Black's Law Dictionary'', p. 1391 col. 2 (Bryan A. Garner 10th ed. 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The attorney–client privilege is one of the oldest recognized privileges for confidential communications.&lt;ref name="Swidler"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Swidler &amp; Berlin v. United States |vol=524 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=399 |pinpoint=[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15126544245741859873#p403 403] |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Supreme Court has stated that by assuring confidentiality, the privilege encourages clients to make "full and frank" disclosures to their attorneys, who are then better able to provide candid advice and effective representation.&lt;ref&gt;''Upjohn Co. v. United States,'' 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

==General requirements under United States law==
Although there are minor variations, the elements necessary to establish the attorney client privilege generally are:

# The asserted holder of the privilege is (or sought to become) a client; and
# The person to whom the communication was made:
## is a member of the bar of a court, or a subordinate of such a member, and
## in connection with this communication, is acting as an attorney; and
# The communication was for the purpose of securing legal advice.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Colton v. United States'', 306 F.2d 633, 637 (2d Cir. 1962), ''cert. denied'', 371 U.S. 951, 83 S. Ct. 505 (1963), ''citing'' ''United States v. United Shoe Mach. Corp.'', 89 F. Supp. 357, 358–59 (D. Mass. 1950).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of exceptions to the privilege in most jurisdictions, chief among them:
#the communication was made in the presence of individuals who were neither attorney nor client, or was disclosed to such individuals,
#the communication was made for the purpose of committing a crime or tort,
#the client has waived the privilege (for example by publicly disclosing the communication).

A corollary to the attorney–client privilege is the [[joint defense privilege]], which is also called the [[common interest rule]].&lt;ref name=Laforest3&gt;''LaForest v. Honeywell International Inc.'', 2004 WL 1498916, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The common interest rule "serves to protect the confidentiality of communications passing from one party to another party where a joint defense or strategy has been decided upon and undertaken by the parties and their respective counsel."&lt;ref name=Laforest3/&gt;

An attorney speaking publicly in regard to a client's personal business and private affairs can be reprimanded by the bar and/or disbarred, regardless of the fact that he or she may be no longer representing the client. Discussing a client's or past client's criminal history, or otherwise, is viewed as a breach of confidentiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_6_confidentiality_of_information.html |title= Client-Lawyer Relationship Rule 1.6 Confidentiality of Information |website=www.americanbar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attorney–client privilege is separate from and should not be confused with the [[work-product doctrine]].

==When the privilege may not apply==
When an attorney is not acting primarily as an attorney but, for instance, as a business advisor, member of the Board of Directors, or in another non-legal role, then the privilege generally does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;''North Pacifica, LLC v. City of Pacifica,'' 274 F.Supp.2d 1118, 1127 (N.D. Cal 2003); ''Handguards, Inc. v. Johnson &amp; Johnson,'' 69 F.R.D. 451, 453 (N.D. Cal 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

The privilege protects the confidential communication, and not the underlying information.  For instance, if a client has previously disclosed confidential information to a third party who is not an attorney, and then gives the same information to an attorney, the attorney–client privilege will still protect the communication to the attorney, but will not protect the communication with the third party.

The privilege may be waived if the confidential communications are disclosed to third parties.

Other limits to the privilege may apply depending on the situation being adjudicated.

===Disclosure in case of a crime, tort, or fraud===
The crime-fraud exception can render the privilege moot when communications between an attorney and client are themselves used to further a crime, [[tort]], or fraud. In ''Clark v. United States'', the [[US Supreme Court]] stated that "A client who consults an attorney for advice that will serve him in the commission of a fraud will have no help from the law. He must let the truth be told."&lt;ref&gt;''Clark v. United States'', 289 U.S. 1, 15 (1933)&lt;/ref&gt; The crime-fraud exception also ''does'' require that the crime or fraud discussed between client and attorney be carried out to be triggered.&lt;ref&gt;In re Grand Jury Subpoena of Francis D. Carter, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19597 (citing In re Sealed Case, 107 F.3d 46, 49, 51 (D.C. Cir. 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; US Courts have not yet conclusively ruled how little knowledge an attorney can have of the underlying crime or fraud before the privilege detaches and the attorney's communications or requisite testimony become admissible.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. ''United States v. Bauer'' 132 F.3d 504 (9th Cir. 1997) vs. ''In re Grand Jury Proceedings'' (1996) (9th Cir. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disclosure ostensibly to support lawyer's own interests===
Lawyers may disclose confidential information relating to the retainer where they are reasonably seeking to collect payment for services rendered. This is justified on policy grounds. If lawyers were unable to disclose such information, many would undertake legal work only where payment is made in advance. This would arguably adversely affect the public's access to justice.

Lawyers may also breach the duty where they are defending themselves against disciplinary or legal proceedings. A client who initiates  proceedings against a lawyer effectively waives rights to confidentiality. This is justified on grounds of procedural fairness—a lawyer unable to reveal information relating to the retainer would be unable to defend themselves against such action.

===Disclosure for the purpose of probate===
{{see also|Probate court|Surrogate's court}}
Another case is for the [[probate]] of a [[last will and testament]]. Previously confidential communications between the lawyer and [[testator]] may be disclosed in order to prove that a will represented the intent of the now deceased [[decedent]]. In many instances, the will, [[codicil (will)|codicil]], or other parts of the [[Estate planning|estate plan]] require explanation or interpretation through other proof (extrinsic evidence), such as the attorney's file notes or correspondence from the client.

In certain cases, the client may desire or consent to revelation of personal or family secrets only after his or her death; for example, the will may leave a [[legacy (property law)|legacy]] to a [[paramour]] or a [[natural child]].

Courts have occasionally revoked the privilege after the death of the client if it is deemed that doing so serves the client's intent, such as in the case of resolving testamentary disputes among heirs.

==Tax practice==
In the United States, communications between accountants and their clients are usually not privileged. A person who is worried about accusations of questionable accounting, such as [[tax evasion]], may decide to work only with an attorney or only with an accountant who is also an attorney; some or all of the resulting communications may be privileged provided that all the requirements for the attorney–client privilege are met. The mere fact that the practitioner is an attorney will not create a valid attorney–client privilege with respect to a communication, for example, that involves business or accounting advice rather than legal advice.

Under Federal tax law in the United States, for communications on or after July 22, 1998, there is a limited Federally authorized [[accountant–client privilege]] that may apply to certain communications with non–attorneys.

==In the federal courts==
If a case arises in the federal court system, the federal court will apply Rule 501 of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] to determine whether to apply the privilege law of the relevant state or federal common law.  If the case is brought to the federal court under [[diversity jurisdiction]], the law of the relevant state will be used to apply the privilege.  If the case involves a [[federal question]], the federal court will apply the federal common law of attorney–client privilege; however, Rule 501 grants flexibility to the federal courts, allowing them to construe the privilege "in light of experience and reason".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4695">In [[Kashmir Shaivism|Kaśmir Śaivism]] the world is described as being composed of four spheres ('''{{IAST|aṇḍa}}''') that contain a series of phenomenal elements ([[tattva]]). The four ''{{IAST|aṇḍa}}'' are described to appear by the means of the internal abundance of [[Shiva|Śiva]]'s divine powers.&lt;ref&gt;Essence of the Exact Reality or Paramārthasāra of Abhinavagupta, B.N. Pandit, 1991, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the four {{IAST|aṇḍa}} is [[The 36 tattvas#.C5.9Biva|Śiva tattva]] which is the substrate and essential nature of all the other tattvas.

=={{IAST|Śakti aṇḍa}}==
Projected by the [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]], '''{{IAST|Śakti aṇḍa}}''' is the first step of creation. Also called ''the pure creation'' because at this level the divine nature of [[Śiva]] is not obscured, it manifests a state of diversity in unity. The divine powers ([[Śakti]]) gradually descend from ''Ānanda Śakti'' (bliss) to ''Icchā Śakti'' (the power of will), ''Jñāna Śakti'' (the power of knowledge) and ''Kriyā Śakti'' (the power of action), at the same time creating the basis for the dual creation. At this stage, though, the duality is only "in concept"; there is no actual division or limitation yet. This ''{{IAST|aṇḍa}}'' contains [[The 36 tattvas#.C5.9Bakti|Śakti tattva]], [[The 36 tattvas#sad.C4.81.C5.9Biva|Sadāśiva tattva]], [[The 36 tattvas#.C4.AB.C5.9Bvara|Iśvara tattva]] and [[The 36 tattvas#.C5.9Buddha vidy.C4.81|Śuddha-vidyā tattva]] (all the pure tattvas except the first one, [[The 36 tattvas#.C5.9Biva|Śiva tattva]]).
&lt;ref name="Tantric Mysticism page 103"&gt;{{IAST|Parā-trīśikā-Vivaraṇa}}, The Secret of the Tantric Mysticism, Abhinavagupta, Jaideva Singh, page 103&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{IAST|Māyā aṇḍa}}==
The ''sphere of [[Maya (illusion)|Māyā]]'' causes the divine nature and purity that exists in {{IAST|Śakti aṇḍa}} to be forgotten. The divine creation is covered with five limitations (''kañcuka'') that make the infinite, eternal, perfect in itself, all knowing and all powerful nature of [[God]], as manifested first in the ''{{IAST|Śakti Aṇḍa}}'', appear limited in space ([[The 36 tattvas#niyati - spatial limitation|Niyati tattva]]) and time ([[The 36 tattvas#k.C4.81la - limitation in time|Kāla tattva]]), incomplete ([[The 36 tattvas#r.C4.81ga - incompleteness.2C the limitation of desire|Rāga tattva]]), with limited knowledge ([[The 36 tattvas#vidy.C4.81 - the limitation of knowledge|Aśuddha-vidyā tattva]]) and power of action ([[The 36 tattvas#kal.C4.81 - limitation in power|Kalā tattva]]). This {{IAST|aṇḍa}} contains seven tattvas, from [[The 36 tattvas#m.C4.81y.C4.81 - the origin of illusion and duality|Māyā tattva]] to [[The 36 tattvas#puru.E1.B9.A3a|{{IAST|Puruṣa tattva}}]].&lt;ref name="Tantric Mysticism page 103"/&gt;

=={{IAST|Prakṛti aṇḍa}}==
'''{{IAST|Prakṛti aṇḍa}}''' describes the world as it is perceived from the common human level of consciousness. It contains the śakti of the individual soul ({{IAST|puruṣa}}): [[The 36 tattvas#prakṛti tattva|{{IAST|Prakṛti tattva}}]], the intellect ([[The 36 tattvas#buddhi - the intellect|Buddhi tattva]]), the ego ([[The 36 tattvas#aha.E1.B9.83k.C4.81ra - the empirical ego|Ahamkāra tattva]]), the sensory mind ([[The 36 tattvas#manas - the lower mind|Manas tattva]]), the five sense organs ([[The 36 tattvas#The five j.C3.B1.C4.81nendriyas - sense organs|Jñānendriya]]), the five organs of action ([[The 36 tattvas#The five karmendriyas - organs of action|Karmendriya]]), the five subtle essences ([[The 36 tattvas#The five tanm.C4.81tras - subtle mediums of the sensations|Tanmātra]]) and the last four physical elements ([[The 36 tattvas#The five mah.C4.81bh.C5.ABtas|Mahābhutā]]) : [[The 36 tattvas#.C4.81k.C4.81.C5.9Ba - ether|Ākāśa tattva]], [[The 36 tattvas#v.C4.81yu - air|Vāyu tattva]], [[The 36 tattvas#tejas - fire|Tejas tattva]] and [[The 36 tattvas#jala - water|Jala tattva]].&lt;ref name="Tantric Mysticism page 103"/&gt;

=={{IAST|Pṛthvī aṇḍa}}==
'''{{IAST|Pṛthvī aṇḍa}}''' is the terminal point of creation&amp;nbsp;– solid matter. There is only one tattva in this sphere: [[The 36 tattvas#p.E1.B9.9Bithv.C4.AB - earth|{{IAST|Pṛthivi tattva}}]]. This tattva has a special statute because it contains in essence all the other tattvas and is the home of [[Kundalini energy|{{IAST|Kuṇḍalinī Śakti}}]].&lt;ref name="Tantric Mysticism page 103"/&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''[[Busemann G-space|Busemann ''G''-space]]''' is a type of [[metric space]] first described by [[Herbert Busemann]] in 1942.

If &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space such that

#  for every two distinct &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;z \in X-\{x,y\}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d(x,z)+d(y,z)=d(x,z)&lt;/math&gt; ([[Menger convexity]])
# every &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-bounded set of infinite cardinality possesses [[accumulation point]]s
# for every &lt;math&gt;w \in X&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;\rho_w&lt;/math&gt; such that for any distinct points &lt;math&gt;x,y \in B(w,\rho_w)&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;z \in  ( b(w,\rho_w)-\{ x,y \} )^\circ&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d(x,z)+d(y,z)=d(x,z)&lt;/math&gt; ([[geodesic]]s are locally extendable)
# for any distinct points &lt;math&gt;x,y \in X&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;u,v \in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d(x,u)+d(y,u)=d(x,u)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d(x,v)+d(y,v)=d(x,v)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(y,u)=d(y,v)&lt;/math&gt; (geodesic extensions are unique).

then ''X'' is said to be a ''Busemann'' ''G''-''space''.  Every Busemann ''G''-space is a [[homogenous space]].

The [[Busemann conjecture]] states that every Busemann ''G''-space is a [[topological manifold]]. It is a special case of the [[Bing–Borsuk conjecture]]. The Busemann conjecture is known to be true for dimensions 1 to 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=M.|first1=Halverson, Denise|last2=Dušan|first2=Repovš,|title=The Bing–Borsuk and the Busemann conjectures|journal=Mathematical Communications|date=23 December 2008|volume=13|issue=2|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/30884|language=en|issn=1331-0623}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Papadopoulos|first1=Athanase|title=Metric Spaces, Convexity and Nonpositive Curvature|date=2005|publisher=European Mathematical Society|isbn=9783037190104|pages=77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JrwzXZB0YrIC&amp;pg=PA77|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Classical mechanics}}
In [[mathematics]] and [[classical mechanics]], '''canonical coordinates''' are sets of [[coordinates]] on [[phase space]] which can be used to describe a physical system at any given point in time. Canonical coordinates are used in the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian formulation]] of [[classical mechanics]]. A closely related concept also appears in [[quantum mechanics]]; see the [[Stone–von Neumann theorem]] and [[canonical commutation relation]]s for details.

As Hamiltonian mechanics is generalized by [[symplectic geometry]] and [[canonical transformation]]s are generalized by [[contact transformation]]s, so the 19th century definition of canonical coordinates in classical mechanics may be generalized to a more abstract 20th century definition of coordinates on the [[cotangent bundle]] of a [[manifold]] (the mathematical notion of phase space).

==Definition in classical mechanics==
In [[classical mechanics]], '''canonical coordinates''' are coordinates &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; in [[phase space]] that are used in the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formalism. The canonical coordinates satisfy the fundamental [[Poisson bracket]] relations:

:&lt;math&gt;\{q_i, q_j\} = 0 \qquad \{p_i, p_j\} = 0 \qquad \{q_i, p_j\} = \delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

A typical example of canonical coordinates is for &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; to be the usual [[Cartesian coordinates]], and &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; to be the components of [[momentum]]. Hence in general, the &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; coordinates are referred to as "conjugate momenta."

Canonical coordinates can be obtained from the [[generalized coordinates]] of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] formalism by a [[Legendre transformation]], or from another set of canonical coordinates by a [[canonical transformation]].

==Definition on cotangent bundles==
Canonical coordinates are defined as a special set of [[coordinates]] on the [[cotangent bundle]] of a [[manifold]]. They are usually written as a set of &lt;math&gt;(q^i,p_j)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(x^i,p_j)&lt;/math&gt; with the ''x'' 's or ''q'' 's denoting the coordinates on the underlying manifold and the ''p'' 's denoting the '''conjugate momentum''', which are [[1-form]]s in the cotangent bundle at point ''q'' in the manifold.

A common definition of canonical coordinates is any set of coordinates on the cotangent bundle that allow the [[canonical one-form]] to be written in the form
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i p_i\,\mathrm{d}q^i&lt;/math&gt;

up to a total differential. A change of coordinates that preserves this form is a [[canonical transformation]]; these are a special case of a [[symplectomorphism]], which are essentially a change of coordinates on a [[symplectic manifold]].

In the following exposition, we assume that the manifolds are real manifolds, so that cotangent vectors acting on tangent vectors produce real numbers.

==Formal development==
Given a manifold {{mvar|Q}}, a [[vector field]] {{mvar|X}} on {{mvar|Q}} (a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of the [[tangent bundle]] {{math|''TQ''}}) can be thought of as a function acting on the [[cotangent bundle]], by the duality between the tangent and cotangent spaces.  That is, define a function

:&lt;math&gt;P_X:T^*Q\to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;P_X(q,p)=p(X_q)&lt;/math&gt;

holds for all cotangent vectors {{mvar|p}} in &lt;math&gt;T_q^*Q&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;X_q&lt;/math&gt; is a vector in &lt;math&gt;T_qQ&lt;/math&gt;, the tangent space to the manifold {{mvar|Q}} at point {{mvar|q}}.  The function &lt;math&gt;P_X&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''momentum function'' corresponding to {{mvar|X}}.

In [[atlas (topology)|local coordinates]], the vector field {{mvar|X}} at point {{mvar|q}} may be written as

:&lt;math&gt;X_q=\sum_i X^i(q) \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\partial /\partial q^i&lt;/math&gt; are the coordinate frame on {{mvar|TQ}}. The conjugate momentum then has the expression 

:&lt;math&gt;P_X(q,p)=\sum_i X^i(q) \;p_i&lt;/math&gt; 

where the &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; are defined as the momentum functions corresponding to the vectors &lt;math&gt;\partial /\partial q^i&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;p_i = P_{\partial /\partial q^i}&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;q^i&lt;/math&gt; together with the &lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt; together form a coordinate system on the cotangent bundle &lt;math&gt;T^*Q&lt;/math&gt;; these coordinates are called the ''canonical coordinates''.

==Generalized coordinates==
In [[Lagrangian mechanics]], a different set of coordinates are used, called the [[generalized coordinates]].  These are commonly denoted as &lt;math&gt;(q_i,\dot{q}_i)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; called the '''generalized position''' and &lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_i&lt;/math&gt; the '''generalized velocity'''.  When a [[symplectic vector field|Hamiltonian]] is defined  on the cotangent bundle, then the generalized coordinates are related to the canonical coordinates by means of the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]]s.

In [[ontology]], the different kinds or ways of [[being]] are called '''categories of being'''; or simply '''categories'''. To investigate the categories of being is to determine the most fundamental and the broadest [[class (philosophy)|class]]es of entities.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} A distinction between such categories, in making the categories or applying them, is called an '''ontological distinction'''.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Early development==
The process of abstraction required to discover the number and names of the categories has been undertaken by many philosophers since [[Aristotle]] and involves the careful inspection of each concept to ensure that there is no higher category or categories under which that concept could be subsumed. The [[Scholasticism|scholars]] of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries developed Aristotle's ideas, firstly, for example by [[Gilbert de la Porrée|Gilbert of Poitiers]], dividing Aristotle's ten categories into two sets, primary and secondary, according to whether they inhere in the subject or not:
*Primary categories: Substance, Relation, Quantity and Quality
*Secondary categories: Place, Time, Situation, Condition, Action, Passion&lt;ref&gt;Reese W.L. ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Religion'' (Harvester Press, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;
Secondly, following [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]’s likening of the classificatory hierarchy to a [[Porphyrian tree|tree]], they concluded that the major classes could be subdivided to form subclasses, for example, [[Substance theory|Substance]] could be divided into [[Genus]] and Species, and [[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]] could be subdivided into [[Property (philosophy)|Property]] and Accident, depending on whether the property was necessary or contingent.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''. cf Evangelou C. ''Aristotle’s Categories and Porphyry'' (E.J. Brill, Leiden, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative line of development was taken by [[Plotinus]] in the second century who by a process of abstraction reduced Aristotle’s list of ten categories to five: Substance, Relation, Quantity, Motion and Quality.&lt;ref&gt;Plotinus ''Enneads'' (tr. Mackenna S. &amp; Page B.S., The Medici Society, London, 1930) VI.3.3&lt;/ref&gt; Plotinus further suggested that the latter three categories of his list, namely Quantity, Motion and Quality correspond to three different kinds of relation and that these three categories could therefore be subsumed under the category of Relation.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''. VI.3.21&lt;/ref&gt; This was to lead to the supposition that there were only two categories at the top of the hierarchical tree, namely Substance and Relation, and if relations only exist in the mind as many supposed, to the two highest categories, Mind and Matter, reflected most clearly in the dualism of [[René Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;Descartes R. ''The Philosophical Works of Descartes'' (tr. Haldane E. &amp; Ross G., Dover, New York, 1911) Vol.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern development==
An alternative conclusion however began to be formulated in the eighteenth century by [[Immanuel Kant]] who realised that we can say nothing about [[Substance theory|Substance]] except through the relation of the subject to other things.&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.3'' p.87&lt;/ref&gt; In the sentence "This is a house" the substantive subject "house" only gains meaning in relation to human use patterns or to other similar houses. The category of Substance disappears from [[Category (Kant)|Kant's tables]], and under the heading of Relation, Kant lists ''inter alia'' the three relationship types of Disjunction, Causality and Inherence.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' pp.107,113&lt;/ref&gt; The three older concepts of Quantity, Motion and Quality, as [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] discovered, could be subsumed under these three broader headings in that [[Quantity]] relates to the subject through the relation of [[Logical disjunction|Disjunction]]; Motion relates to the subject through the relation of [[Causality]]; and [[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]] relates to the subject through the relation of [[Inherence]].&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.5'' pp.148-179&lt;/ref&gt; Sets of three continued to play an important part in the nineteenth century development of the categories, most notably in [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F. Hegel's]] extensive tabulation of categories,&lt;ref&gt;Stace W.T. ''The Philosophy of Hegel'' (Macmillan &amp; Co, London, 1924)&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Categories (Peirce)|C.S. Peirce's categories]] set out in his work on the logic of relations. One of Peirce's contributions was to call the three primary categories Firstness, Secondness and Thirdness&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.5'' pp.148-179&lt;/ref&gt; which both emphasises their general nature, and avoids the confusion of having the same name for both the category itself and for a concept within that category.

In a separate development, and building on the notion of primary and secondary categories introduced by the Scholastics, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] introduced the idea that secondary or "derivative" categories could be derived from the primary categories through the combination of one primary category with another.&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.3'' p.116&lt;/ref&gt; This would result in the formation of three secondary categories: the first, "Community" was an example that Kant gave of such a derivative category; the second, "[[Linguistic modality|Modality]]", introduced by Kant, was a term which Hegel, in developing Kant's dialectical method, showed could also be seen as a derivative category;&lt;ref&gt;Hegel G.W.F. ''Logic'' (tr. Wallace W., Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1975) pp.124ff&lt;/ref&gt; and the third, "Spirit" or "Will" were terms that [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.15''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer A. ''On the Four-Fold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason''  1813 (tr. Payne E., La Salle, Illinois, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; were developing separately for use in their own systems. [[Karl Jaspers]] in the twentieth century, in his development of existential categories, brought the three together, allowing for differences in terminology, as Substantiality, Communication and Will.&lt;ref&gt;Jaspers K. ''Philosophy'' 1932 (tr. Ashton E.B., University of Chicago Press, 1970) pp.117ff&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern of three primary and three secondary categories was used most notably in the nineteenth century by [[Peter Mark Roget]] to form the six headings of his [[Roget's Thesaurus|Thesaurus]] of English Words and Phrases. The headings used were the three objective categories of Abstract Relation, Space (including Motion) and Matter and the three subjective categories of Intellect, Feeling and Volition, and he found that under these six headings all the words of the English language, and hence any possible predicate, could be assembled.&lt;ref&gt;Roget P.M. ''Roget’s Thesaurus: The Everyman Edition'' 1952 (Pan Books, London, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twentieth century development==
In the twentieth century the primacy of the division between the subjective and the objective, or between mind and matter, was disputed by, among others, [[Bertrand Russell]]&lt;ref&gt;Russell B. ''The Analysis of Mind'' (George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, 1921) pp.10,23&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gilbert Ryle]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryle G. ''The Concept of Mind''  (Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1949) pp.17ff&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy began to move away from the metaphysics of categorisation towards the linguistic problem of trying to differentiate between, and define, the words being used. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]’s conclusion was that there were no clear definitions which we can give to words and categories but only a "halo" or "corona"&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein L. ''Philosophical Investigations'' 1953 (tr. Anscombe G., Blackwell, Oxford, 1978) pp.14,181&lt;/ref&gt; of related meanings radiating around each term. Gilbert Ryle thought the problem could be seen in terms of dealing with "a galaxy of ideas" rather than a single idea, and suggested that [[category mistake]]s are made when a concept (e.g. "university"), understood as falling under one category (e.g. abstract idea), is used as though it falls under another (e.g. physical object).&lt;ref&gt;Ryle G. ''Collected Papers'' (Hutchinson, London, 1971) Vol.II: ''Philosophical Arguments'' 1945, pp.201,202&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the visual analogies being used, [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] and [[Clarence Irving Lewis|Lewis]],&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.1'' pp.52,82,106&lt;/ref&gt; just like [[Plotinus]] earlier,&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.9'' VI.5.5&lt;/ref&gt; likened the terms of propositions to points, and the relations between the terms to lines. Peirce, taking this further, talked of univalent, bivalent and trivalent relations linking predicates to their subject and it is just the number and types of relation linking subject and predicate that determine the category into which a predicate might fall.&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.5'' Vol I pp.159,176&lt;/ref&gt; Primary categories contain concepts where there is one dominant kind of relation to the subject. Secondary categories contain concepts where there are two dominant kinds of relation. Examples of the latter were given by [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] in his two propositions "the house is on the creek" where the two dominant relations are spatial location (Disjunction) and cultural association (Inherence), and "the house is eighteenth century" where the two relations are temporal location (Causality) and cultural quality (Inherence).&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.4'' pp.62,187&lt;/ref&gt; A third example may be inferred from Kant in the proposition "the house is impressive or [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]" where the two relations are spatial or mathematical disposition (Disjunction) and dynamic or motive power (Causality).&lt;ref&gt;Kant I. ''Critique of Judgement'' 1790 (tr. Meredith J.C., Clarendon Press, Oxford 1952) p.94ff&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.25'' pp.36,152&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the analogy of [[colour theory]] in order to illustrate the shades of meanings of words. Primary categories, like primary colours, are analytical representing the furthest we can go in terms of analysis and abstraction and include Quantity, Motion and Quality. Secondary categories, like secondary colours, are synthetic and include concepts such as Substance, Community and Spirit.

==Aristotle==
{{Main|Categories (Aristotle)}}
One of [[Aristotle]]’s early interests lay in the classification of the natural world, how for example the genus "animal" could be first divided into "two-footed animal" and then into "wingless, two-footed animal".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Metaphysics'' 1075a&lt;/ref&gt; He realised that the distinctions were being made according to the qualities the animal possesses, the quantity of its parts and the kind of motion that it exhibits. To fully complete the proposition "this animal is…" Aristotle stated in his work on the [[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]] that there were ten kinds of predicate where...

"…each signifies either substance or quantity or quality or relation or where or when or being-in-a-position or having or acting or being acted upon".&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.2''&lt;/ref&gt;

He realised that predicates could be simple or complex. The simple kinds consist of a subject and a predicate linked together by the "categorical" or inherent type of relation. For Aristotle the more complex kinds were limited to propositions where the predicate is compounded of two of the above categories for example "this is a horse running". More complex kinds of proposition were only discovered after Aristotle by the Stoic, [[Chrysippus]],&lt;ref&gt;Long A. &amp; Sedley D. ''The Hellenistic Philosophers'' (Cambridge University Press, 1987) p.206&lt;/ref&gt; who developed the "hypothetical" and "disjunctive" types of [[syllogism]] and these were terms which were to be developed through the [[Scholasticism|Middle Ages]]&lt;ref&gt;Peter of Spain (''alias'' John XXI) ''Summulae Logicales''&lt;/ref&gt; and were to reappear in [[Category (Kant)|Kant's system of categories]].

''Category'' came into use with [[Aristotle]]'s essay ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'', in which he discussed univocal and [[equivocal]] terms, predication, and ten categories:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2412/2412-h/2412-h.htm Categories]'', translated by [[Ella Mary Edghill|E. M. Edghill]]. For the Greek terms, see ''[http://meta.montclair.edu/ancient/greek/aristotle_greek/ The Complete Works of Aristotle in Greek]'' (requires DjVu), Book 1 (''Organon''), ''Categories'' Section 4 (DjVu file's page 6).{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2412/2412-h/2412-h.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-21 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102084057/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2412/2412-h/2412-h.htm |archivedate=2013-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Affection (philosophy)|Affection]]''', passion (''paschein'', to suffer or undergo) – examples: to be lanced, to be heated, to be cooled

==Plotinus==
[[Plotinus]] in writing his ''[[Enneads]]'' around AD 250 recorded that "philosophy at a very early age investigated the number and character of the existents… some found ten, others less…. to some the genera were the first principles, to others only a generic classification of existents".&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.9'' VI.1.1&lt;/ref&gt; He realised that some categories were reducible to others saying "why are not Beauty, Goodness and the virtues, Knowledge and Intelligence included among the primary genera?"&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' VI.2.17&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that such [[Transcendentals|transcendental categories]] and even the [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories of Aristotle]] were in some way posterior to the three [[Eleatics|Eleatic]] categories first recorded in Plato's dialogue ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'' and which comprised the following three coupled terms: 
*Unity/Plurality
*Motion/Stability
*Identity/Difference&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Parmenides'' (tr. Jowett B., ''The Dialogues of Plato'', Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1875) p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plotinus]] called these "the hearth of reality"&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.9'' Op.cit.1.4&lt;/ref&gt; deriving from them not only the three categories of Quantity, Motion and Quality but also what came to be known as "the three moments of the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic world process]]":
*First, there existed the "One", and his view that "the origin of things is a contemplation"
*The Second "is certainly an activity… a secondary phase… life streaming from life… energy running through the universe"
*The Third is some kind of Intelligence concerning which he wrote "Activity is prior to Intellection… and self knowledge"&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' III.8.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Plotinus likened the three to the centre, the radii and the circumference of a circle, and clearly thought that the principles underlying the categories were the first principles of creation. "From a single root all being multiplies". Similar ideas were to be introduced into Early Christian thought by, for example, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] who summed it up saying "Therefore Unity, having from all eternity arrived by motion at duality, came to rest in [[trinity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson A.E. (ed.) ''Essays on the Trinity and the Incarnation'' (Longmans, London, 1928) pp.241-244&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kant==

In the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781), [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that the [[Category (Kant)|categories]] are part of our own mental structure and consist of a set of ''a priori'' concepts through which we interpret the world around us.&lt;ref&gt;	''Op.cit.3'' p.87&lt;/ref&gt; These concepts correspond to twelve logical functions of the understanding which we use to make judgements and there are therefore two tables given in the ''Critique'', one of the Judgements and a corresponding one for the [[Category (Kant)|Categories]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' pp.107,113&lt;/ref&gt; To give an example, the logical function behind our reasoning from ground to consequence (based on the [[Hypothetical syllogism|Hypothetical relation]]) underlies our understanding of the world in terms of cause and effect (the [[Causality|Causal relation]]). In each table the number twelve arises from, firstly, an initial division into two: the Mathematical and the Dynamical; a second division of each of these headings into a further two: Quantity and Quality, and Relation and Modality respectively; and, thirdly, each of these then divides into a further three subheadings as follows.

{{col-end}}
[[Critique of the Kantian philosophy|Criticism of Kant's system]] followed, firstly, by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], who amongst other things was unhappy with the term "Community", and declared that the tables "do open violence to truth, treating it as nature was treated by old-fashioned gardeners",&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer A. ''The World as Will and Representation'' (tr. Payne A., Dover Publications, London, New York, 1966) p.430&lt;/ref&gt; and secondly, by [[Walter Terence Stace|W.T.Stace]] who in his book ''The Philosophy of Hegel'' suggested that in order to make Kant's structure completely symmetrical a third category would need to be added to the Mathematical and the Dynamical.&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.15'' p.222&lt;/ref&gt; This, he said, Hegel was to do with his category of Notion.

==Hegel==
[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F. Hegel]] in his ''[[Science of Logic]]'' (1812) attempted to provide a more comprehensive system of categories than Kant and developed a structure that was almost entirely triadic.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; So important were the categories to Hegel that he claimed "the first principle of the world, the Absolute, is a system of categories… the categories must be the reason of which the world is a consequent".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' pp.63,65&lt;/ref&gt;

Using his own logical method of combination, later to be called the [[Dialectic|Hegelian dialectic]], of arguing from thesis through antithesis to synthesis, he arrived, as shown in W.T.Stace's work cited, at a hierarchy of some 270 categories. The three very highest categories were Logic, Nature and Spirit. The three highest categories of Logic, however, he called Being, Essence and Notion which he explained as follows:
*[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Being]] was differentiated from Nothing by containing with it the concept of the "Other", an initial internal division that can be compared with Kant's category of Disjunction. Stace called the category of Being the sphere of common sense containing concepts such as consciousness, sensation, quantity, quality and measure.
*[[Essence]]. The "Other" separates itself from the "One" by a kind of motion, reflected in Hegel's first synthesis of "[[Becoming (philosophy)|Becoming]]". For Stace this category represented the sphere of science containing within it firstly, the thing, its form and properties; secondly, cause, effect and reciprocity, and thirdly, the principles of classification, identity and difference. 
*[[Notion (philosophy)|Notion]]. Having passed over into the "Other" there is an almost [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic return]] into a higher unity that in embracing the "One" and the "Other" enables them to be considered together through their inherent qualities. This according to [[Walter Terence Stace|Stace]] is the sphere of philosophy proper where we find not only the three types of logical proposition: Disjunctive, Hypothetical and Categorical but also the three transcendental concepts of [[Transcendentals|Beauty, Goodness and Truth]].&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.18'' pp.124ff&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer's]] category that corresponded with Notion was that of Idea, which in his "''Four-Fold Root of Sufficient Reason''" he complemented with the category of the Will.&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.20''&lt;/ref&gt; The title of his major work was "[[The World as Will and Representation|The World as Will and Idea]]". The two other complementary categories, reflecting one of Hegel's initial divisions, were those of Being and Becoming. At around the same time, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] was developing his colour theories in the ''[[Theory of Colours|Farbenlehre]]'' of 1810, and introduced similar principles of combination and complementation, symbolising, for Goethe, "the primordial relations which belong both to nature and vision".&lt;ref&gt;Goethe J.W. von, ''The Theory of Colours'' (tr. Eastlake C.L., MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1970) p.350&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] in his ''[[Science of Logic]]'' accordingly asks us to see his system not as a tree but as a circle.

==Peirce==

[[Charles Sanders Peirce]], who had read Kant and Hegel closely, and who also had some knowledge of Aristotle, proposed a system of merely three phenomenological categories: [[Categories (Peirce)|Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness]], which he repeatedly invoked in his subsequent writings. Like Hegel, C.S.Peirce attempted to develop a system of categories from a single indisputable principle, in Peirce's case the notion that in the first instance he could only be aware of his own ideas. 
	"It seems that the true categories of consciousness are first, feeling… second, a sense of resistance… and third, synthetic consciousness, or thought".&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.5'' p.200, cf Locke&lt;/ref&gt;
	Elsewhere he called the three primary categories: [[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]], Reaction and [[Meaning (semiotics)|Meaning]], and even [[Categories (Peirce)|Firstness, Secondness and Thirdness]], saying, "perhaps it is not right to call these categories conceptions, they are so intangible that they are rather tones or tints upon conceptions":&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' p.179&lt;/ref&gt;     
*Firstness ([[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]]): "The first is predominant in feeling… we must think of a quality without parts, e.g. the colour of magenta… When I say it is a quality I do not mean that it "inheres" in a subject… The whole content of consciousness is made up of qualities of feeling, as truly as the whole of space is made up of points, or the whole of time by instants".
*Secondness (Reaction): "This is present even in such a rudimentary fragment of experience as a simple feeling… an action and reaction between our soul and the stimulus… The idea of second is predominant in the ideas of causation and of statical force… the real is active; we acknowledge it by calling it the actual".
*Thirdness ([[Meaning (semiotics)|Meaning]]): "Thirdness is essentially of a general nature… ideas in which thirdness predominate [include] the idea of a sign or representation… Every genuine triadic relation involves meaning… the idea of meaning is irreducible to those of quality and reaction… synthetical consciousness is the consciousness of a third or medium".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' pp.148-179&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Peirce's three categories correspond to the three concepts of relation given in Kant's tables, the sequence is now reversed and follows that given by [[Science of Logic|Hegel]], and indeed before Hegel of the three moments of the world-process given by [[Neoplatonism|Plotinus]]. Later, Peirce gave a mathematical reason for there being three categories in that although monadic, dyadic and triadic nodes are irreducible, every node of a higher valency is reducible to a "compound of triadic relations".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' p.176&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who was developing "semiology" in France just as Peirce was developing "semiotics" in the US, likened each term of a proposition to "the centre of a constellation, the point where other coordinate terms, the sum of which is indefinite, converge".&lt;ref&gt;Saussure F. de,''Course in General Linguistics'' 1916 (tr. Harris R., Duckworth, London, 1983) p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

==Others==
[[Edmund Husserl]] (1962, 2000) wrote extensively about categorial systems as part of his [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

For [[Gilbert Ryle]] (1949), a category (in particular a "[[category mistake]]") is an important semantic concept, but one having only loose affinities to an ontological category.

Contemporary systems of categories have been proposed by [[John G. Bennett]] (The Dramatic Universe, 4 vols., 1956–65), [[Wilfrid Sellars]] (1974), [[Reinhardt Grossmann]] (1983, 1992), Johansson (1989), Hoffman and Rosenkrantz (1994), [[Roderick Chisholm]] (1996), [[Barry Smith (ontologist)]] (2003), and [[Jonathan Lowe]] (2006).

{{see also|Corporal punishment in the home|School corporal punishment}}
English [[common law]] allowed parents and others who have "lawful control or charge" of a child to use "moderate and reasonable" chastisement or correction. In the 1860 [[Eastbourne manslaughter]] case, [[Sir Alexander Cockburn, 12th Baronet|Alexander Cockburn]] as [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Chief Justice]] ruled: "By the law of England, a parent ... may for the purpose of correcting what is evil in the child, inflict moderate and reasonable corporal punishment, always, however, with this condition, that it is moderate and reasonable." It was left to the courts to decide what is meant by "moderate and reasonable" in any particular case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/progress/reports/uk.html# |title=Lawfulness of corporal punishment |access-date=2010-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406023038/http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/progress/reports/uk.html# |archive-date=2010-04-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rights of parents, guardians and teachers, in regard to the chastisement of children, were expressly recognized in English law by the [[Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act]] 1904 (§ 28). A master had a right to inflict moderate chastisement upon his [[apprentice]] for neglect or other misbehaviour, provided that he did so himself, and that the apprentice was under age (Archbold, Cr. Pl., 23rd ed., 795).&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 189"&gt;{{ EB1911 |inline=1 |wstitle=Corporal Punishment |volume=7 |page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England and Wales]], section 58 of the [[Children Act 2004]] enables parents to justify [[common assault]] or [[battery (crime)]] of their children as "reasonable punishment", but prevents the defence being used in relation to [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] (i.e. when causing anything beyond "transient and trifling" such as bruising) and any more serious harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/progress/reports/uk.html# |title=Lawfulness of corporal punishment |access-date=2010-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406023038/http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/progress/reports/uk.html# |archive-date=2010-04-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[law in the Republic of Ireland]], the [[rule of law]] allowing "physical chastisement" by teachers was abolished in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/26/section/24/enacted/en/html#sec24|title=Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, Section 24|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the common-law defence of "reasonable chastisement" by parents and guardians was abolished in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;

[[William Blackstone]] wrote in the 18th century in the [[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/bla-115.htm William Blackstone. Commentaries on the Laws of England]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The husband also (by the old law) might give his wife moderate correction. For, as he is to answer for her misbehaviour, the law thought it reasonable to entrust him with the power of restraining her, by domestic chastisement.... But, with us, in the politer reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles the Second]], this power of correction began to be doubted: and a wife may now have security of the peace against her husband; or, in return, a husband against his wife....Yet the lower rank of people, who were always fond of the old common law, still claim and exert their ancient privilege: and the courts of law will still permit a husband to restrain a wife of her liberty, in case of any gross misbehavior.}}

In the UK the traditional right of a husband to inflict moderate corporal punishment on his wife in order to keep her "within the bounds of duty" was similarly removed in 1891.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 189"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawteacher.net/family-law-resources/domestic-violence.php |title=R. v Jackson [1891] 1 QB 671, (abstract) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907012332/http://www.lawteacher.net/family-law-resources/domestic-violence.php |archive-date=7 September 2014 |website=LawTeacher.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1870s, courts in the United States overruled the common-law principle that a husband had the right to "physically chastise an errant wife".&lt;ref&gt;Calvert, R. "Criminal and civil liability in husband-wife assaults", in ''Violence in the family'' (Suzanne K. Steinmetz and Murray A. Straus, eds.), Harper &amp; Row, New York, 1974. {{ISBN|0-396-06864-2}} p.

[[File:This_dog_is_"comfy"-_2013-12-27_10-51.jpg|thumbnail|A comfortable dog]]

'''Comfort''' (or being ''comfortable'') is a sense of physical or psychological [[pleasure|ease]], often characterized as a lack of [[suffering|hardship]]. Persons who are lacking in comfort are '''uncomfortable''', or experiencing '''discomfort'''. A degree of psychological comfort can be achieved by recreating experiences that are associated with pleasant [[memory|memories]], such as engaging in familiar activities,&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Daniel Miller, ''The Comfort of Things'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; maintaining the presence of [[comfort object|familiar objects]],&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; and consumption of [[comfort food]]s. Comfort is a particular concern in [[health care]], as providing comfort to the sick and injured is one goal of healthcare, and can facilitate recovery.&lt;ref name="Kolcaba"&gt;Katharine Kolcaba, ''Comfort Theory and Practice: A Vision for Holistic Health Care and Research'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Persons who are surrounded with things that provide psychological comfort may be described as being "in their [[comfort zone]]". Because of the personal nature of positive associations, psychological comfort is highly subjective.&lt;ref name="Kolcaba"/&gt;

The use of "comfort" as a verb generally implies that the subject is in a state of [[pain]], [[suffering]] or affliction, and requires alleviation from that state. Where the term is used to describe the support given to someone who has experienced a tragedy, the word is synonymous with [[consolation]] or [[wikt:solace|solace]]. However, comfort is used much more broadly, as one can provide physical comfort to someone who is not in a position to be uncomfortable. For example, a person might sit in a chair without discomfort, but still find the addition of a pillow to the chair to increase their feeling of comfort. Something that provides this type of comfort, which does not seek to relieve hardship, can also be referred to as being "comfy". Like certain other terms describing positive feelings or abstractions (hope, charity, chastity), comfort may also be used as a [[personal name]].

==Concepts==
[[File:Rama comforts Sita.jpg|thumb|Rama comforts Sita]]
There are various psychological studies about the feeling of comfort, and they have resulted in a few conclusions. The idea of comfort varies among each person; however, there are a few universal themes of comfort that apply to everyone. Most of these universal themes falls under the physical comfort such as contact comfort, comfort food, and thermal comfort.

=== Contact comfort ===
Contact comfort is the satisfaction with someone's touch, like a mother's embrace. This is essential to a child's development.

==== Harry Harlow study ====

One of the most famous developmental psychological studies is [[Harry Harlow]]'s development experiment with monkeys. He separated baby monkeys at birth and raised them with surrogate mothers. There were two types of surrogate mothers, a metal wire one and a one covered with cloth, and each had a nozzle that represented breast feeding. The surrogate mother covered in cloth represented comfort. At the end of the experiment, the psychologist saw that the monkeys would choose the cloth surrogate over the wire surrogate. They concluded that having basics needs is essential, but there is the need of closeness and affection.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

This experiment justified that importance of comfort and warmth for child development. All the monkeys that grew up from the experiment expressed a behavior of aggression and atypical sexual behaviors.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/harlow.htm|title = Psychology History|website = muskingum.edu|access-date = 2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comfort food ===
[[Comfort food]]s are foods intentionally consumed to move the eater into a pleasurable state. This could be credited to food preferences and childhood experiences (like a mother's cooking).

==== Physiological responses ====
Comfort food are usually chosen because of previous experiences of happiness linked with it. For example, chocolate is held as a popular comfort food as it is follows the pleasurable sweetness and the positive association with gifts/rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Barthel|first = Diane|date = August 1989|title = Modernism and Marketing: The Chocolate Box Revisited|url = http://tcs.sagepub.com/content/6/3/429.short|journal = Theory, Culture, &amp; Society|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The time of day also play a role in consuming comfort foods. Most people tend to eat simply because "it's lunch time" and only 20% of the time is due to actual hunger &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = TUOMISTO|first = T|last2 = TUOMISTO|first2 = MT|last3 = HETHERINGTON|first3 = M|last4 = LAPPALAINEN|first4 = R|date = 1998-04-01|title = Reasons for Initiation and Cessation of Eating in Obese Men and Women and the Affective Consequences of Eating in Everyday Situations|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666397901422|journal = Appetite|volume = 30|issue = 2|pages = 211–222|doi = 10.1006/appe.1997.0142}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Popular_comfort_foods.png|thumb|288x288px|Popular Comfort Foods]]

==== Food preferences ====
Food preferences splits into two categories, snack-related and meal-related.  If a child was exposed to many snacks growing up, he/she would focus on more snack-related comfort foods later on in life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Food preference ranges through male/female, and younger/older&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Wansink|first = Brian|last2 = Cheney|first2 = Matthew M.|last3 = Chan|first3 = Nina|date = 2003-09-01|title = Exploring comfort food preferences across age and gender|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938403002038|journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume = 79|issue = 4–5|pages = 739–747|doi = 10.1016/S0031-9384(03)00203-8|pmid=12954417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thermal comfort ===
[[File:Comfort_level_x_temperature_Chart.jpg|thumb|382x382px|Comfort level average on the temperature]]
[[Thermal comfort]] is a satisfaction of the ambient air temperature and humidity. Psychologists devised a study to determine the most comfortable temperature. The study had people answering a survey as the temperature changed around them. From the surveys, psychologist found many people had no opinion of a range of temperature.This was labeled temperature neutrality, which is the rate as the person [[metabolism]] is shifting the same rate as the surrounding temperature. The average comfortable temperature is 30 degrees Celsius. Temperatures too hot (35&amp;nbsp;°C and above) and temperatures too low (12&amp;nbsp;°C and below) are considered uncomfortable to many people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Gagge|first = A. P.|last2 = Stolwijk|first2 = J. A. J.|last3 = Hardy|first3 = J. D.|date = 1967-06-01|title = Comfort and thermal sensations and associated physiological responses at various ambient temperatures|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0013935167900023|journal = Environmental Research|volume = 1|issue = 1|pages = 1–20|doi = 10.1016/0013-9351(67)90002-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Thermal neutrality ====
Thermal Neutrality ([[Thermal neutral zone|Thermal Neutral Zone]]) is the temperature range where it is neither comfortable or uncomfortable. The human body's metabolism is burning calories at the same rate as the temperature around. This would be around 24&amp;nbsp;°C (room temperature), and people have no opinion about the temperature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thermal Neutrality is often also used in animal raising.For example, Farmers maintain the neutral temperature for cattle to prevent [[Cold stress|Cold Stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://articles.extension.org/pages/44454/explain-the-concepts-of-thermoneutral-zone-lower-critical-temperature-and-upper-critical-temperature|title = Explain the concepts of thermoneutral zone, lower critical temperature, and upper critical temperature, and how they relate to metabolic rate - eXtension|website = articles.extension.org|access-date = 2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Everyday uses ====
* Floor Surface Temperature - too hot or too cold floors cause discomfort, people wear light shoes or have heated floors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Ventilation - no proper air flow throughout a room causes the room to be too hot, windows, fans allow a man-made air current, and air conditioning helps with the heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://energy.gov/energysaver/ventilation|title = Ventilation {{!}} Department of Energy|website = energy.gov|access-date = 2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ansel Adams and camera.jpg|thumb|Ansel Easton Adams (1902–1984), an American [[photographer]] and [[environmentalist]], photo by [[J. Malcolm Greany]]]]

'''Conservation photography''' is the active use of the [[photographic process]] and its products, within the parameters of [[photojournalism]], to [[advocate]] for [[Conservation biology|conservation]] outcomes.

Conservation photography combines [[nature photography]] with the proactive, issue-oriented approach of [[documentary photography]] as an agent for protecting [[nature]] and improving the [[biosphere]] and [[natural environment]]. Conservation Photography furthers [[environmental conservation]], [[wildlife conservation]], [[habitat conservation]] or cultural conservation by expanding public awareness of issues and stimulating remedial action.

==History==
[[File:Carleton E. Watkins - Mt. Broderick, Nevada Fall - SFM.95.98 01 d02.jpg|thumb|Photo by [[Carleton Watkins|Carleton E. Watkins]] (1829–1916) of Mt. Broderick and Nevada Fall (700 ft.) at Yosemite Valley in 1861]]
[[File:Ansel Adams-Half Dome, Apple Orchard, Yosemite.jpg|thumb|Photo by [[Ansel Adams]] of Yosemite Half Dome, Apple Orchard, trees with snow on branches in April 1933]]
Photography has developed as a powerful medium to empower conservation. Photography has served this role since the 1860s, although not widely acknowledged as such.&lt;ref name=" "&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example are the powerful images of [[Carleton Watkins]] which were successfully used to stimulate the establishment of [[Yosemite National Park]] in 1864 and [[William Henry Jackson]] and [[Ansel Adams]] who advocated for expansion and continued funding of the park.

Renewed emphasis on photography-for-conservation arose at the beginning of the 21st century, primarily in response to the human-caused [[environmental crisis]], recognizing that the global pattern of [[ecosystem]] degradation was not sustainable.

The modern field of conservation photography was formalized in October 2005 with the founding of the [[International League of Conservation Photographers]] by photographer [[Cristina Mittermeier]], during the 8th [[World Wilderness Congress]] in [[Anchorage, Alaska]]. Prior to 2005 "conservation photography" was not widely recognized as a discipline.

==Definition==
[[File:Seashell vendor.jpeg|thumb|Photo of a vendor in Tanzania in 2000 selling to tourists [[threatened species]] [[seashell]]s which have been taken alive from the sea, killing the animal inside.]]

Conservation and photography appear as two distinct fields, but their combined impact can be profound. Simply put, conservation photography is photography that empowers or enables conservation.

According to the acclaimed photographer, [[Joel Sartore]], “the typical nature photograph shows a butterfly on a pretty flower. The conservation photograph shows the same thing, but with a bulldozer coming at it in the background. This doesn’t mean there’s no room for beautiful pictures, in fact we need beautiful images just as much as the issues. It does mean that the images exist for a reason; to save the Earth while we still can.”

The serious conservation photographer brings to their work a deep empathy for the natural world. Proper use of the resulting images has the power to bring about positive change.

Conservation photographs fall into two broad categories, both of which are equally valuable:

*The snapshot: upon seeing a striking scene one pulls out a cell phone or point-and-shoot camera, and snaps some quick framed pictures without expending too much time or effort.
*The carefully crafted image:: One sees the same scene, but instead of quickly shooting it and moving on, they take a series of skillfully crafted, high-quality images that tell the story in a more powerful way. Dramatic framing enhances the influence of a picture.

Such photographs have a stronger impact on the audience. One may also proactively seek opportunities to take crafted conservation pictures. Determined effort can result in excellent photo stories that can move people’s hearts and minds.&lt;ref name="CI"/&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Gp-esso.jpg|thumb|Photo of [[Greenpeace]] protest against [[Esso]] /[[ExxonMobil in 2003]]]]
[[File:2011 flooding in Ayutthaya Province-EO-1 merged.jpg|thumb|True-colour [[satellite image]] showing [[flood]]ing in Ayutthaya and Pathum Thani Provinces in Central [[Thailand]] (right), compared to before the flooding (left) in 2011]]
In order to create an impact, conservation pictures should be put to work for specific causes. Though not every picture may find an immediate use, a carefully catalogued archive of conservation pictures can help increase impact of conservation related news stories, provide material for public awareness campaigns, including [[internet activism]] and sometimes serve as [[Investigative journalism]] evidence in court proceedings. Images of habitat destruction, especially in [[protected area]]s, can be important as legal evidence against the activity.

==Organizations==
There are many [[environmental organization]]s that effectively use conservation photography to help advocate their goals. Just a few are:


*[[ARKive]] is a global initiative with the mission of "promoting the conservation of the world's threatened species, through the power of wildlife imagery", which it does by locating and gathering films, photographs and audio recordings of the world's [[species]] into a centralised [[Digital data|digital]] [[archive]]. Its current priority is the completion of audio-visual profiles for the c. 17,000 species on the [[IUCN Red List]] of [[threatened species]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkive.org/about/|title=About ARKive|work=ARKive|accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sanctuary Asia]] is [[India]]'s first and one of its leading [[Environmentalism|environmental]] [[news magazine]]s. It was founded in 1981 to raise awareness among [[Indian people]] of their disappearing [[natural heritage]]. The magazine is attractively packaged&lt;ref&gt;Various authors, India, pp. 76; [[Lonely Planet]] Publications, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; with colored photographs. The ''Sanctuary Photo Library''' is a melting pot of natural history visuals, information and resources used to produce some of the finest wildlife and nature calendars, posters, slide shows, exhibitions and other products available in India.
*[[Sierra club]] maintains a publishing imprint, [[Sierra Club Books]], publishing books on environmental issues, wilderness photographic essays, nature guides, and other related subjects.

'''[[Constitutionalism]] in the United States''' is a basic value espoused by political parties, activist groups and individuals across a wide range of the political spectrum, that the powers of federal, state and local governments are limited by the [[Constitution of the United States]] and that the [[civil and political rights]] of citizens should not be violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/constitutionalism/| title=Constitutionalism| publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| accessdate=September 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attack ==
According to [[Save the Children]], at the time of the attack the children were on a bus heading back to school from a picnic when the driver stopped to get refreshment at the market in Dahyan.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Most of the children were under age 10, according to the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A Red Cross – supported hospital in [[Sa'dah|Saada]] received the bodies of 29 children under 15 years of age and 48 wounded individuals, 30 of whom were children.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/saudi-arabia-airstrike-yemen-kids-killed-bus-dahyan-market-saada-icrc-says/|title=Saudi coalition airstrike in Yemen kills 50, rebels say|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A total of 40 children were killed in the strike.&lt;ref&gt;https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/17/middleeast/us-saudi-yemen-bus-strike-intl/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a resident of Dahyan, the warplanes had been hovering over the area for more than an hour before they attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/dozens-children-killed-and-injured-airstrike-yemen-bus-red-cross-says-61507076|title=At least 29 children killed by Saudi-led air strike on Yemeni school bus|work=Middle East Eye|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another witness said, "Our shops were open and shoppers were walking around as usual.

The bomb that killed the children was a [[MK 82 bomb]] made by [[Lockheed Martin]]. It had been supplied by the [[United States]] to [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name=CNN17/&gt;

== Media coverage ==
The attack came to light after videos were posted on [[Twitter]] depicting the remains of the bus and the children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Images of the victims were aired on the [[Almasirah|Al Masirah TV]] network, highlighting dramatic images of blood and debris-covered children lying on hospital stretchers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The Saudi Arabian coalition later issued a statement saying that they conducted an airstrike in Saada but were targeting [[Houthi]] missile launchers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The mass funeral of the children was aired on the Al Mariah TV network, with thousands of Yemenis participating.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/08/14/protests-at-funeral-for-yemeni-children-killed-in-coalition-strike.html|title=Protests at funeral for Yemeni children killed in coalition strike|last=Post|first=The Jakarta|work=The Jakarta Post|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==

=== Domestic ===
The official Saudi Arabian press agency called the strike a "legitimate military action" which targeted those who were responsible for a rebel missile attack on the Saudi Arabian city of [[Jizan]] on Wednesday.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/09/world/middleeast/yemen-airstrike-school-bus-children.html|title=Saudi Coalition Bombs School Bus in Yemen, Killing Dozens|access-date=10 August 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also claimed that the airstrikes "conformed to international and humanitarian laws"&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and that [[Houthis]] were using children as human shields.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Yemeni journalist Nasser Arrabyee reported that there were no Houthis in the vicinity of the strike.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A Houthi spokesman said that the coalition showed "clear disregard for civilian life", as the attack had targeted a crowded public place in the city.&lt;ref name="Reuters 9082018" /&gt; During the mass funeral of the children, many signs were visible protesting against the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Israel.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

On 1 September 2018, the Saudi Arabian-led coalition admitted mistakes, expressing regrets and pledged to hold those responsible for the strikes accountable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-45382561|title='Mistakes' admitted in Yemen bus attack|date=2018-09-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], and particularly in [[potential theory]], '''Dirichlet's principle''' is the assumption that the minimizer of a certain [[energy functional]] is a solution to [[Poisson's equation]].

==Formal statement==
'''Dirichlet's principle''' states that, if the function &lt;math&gt; u ( x ) &lt;/math&gt; is the solution to [[Poisson's equation]] 

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta u + f = 0&lt;/math&gt;

on a [[domain of a function|domain]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; with [[boundary condition]] 

:&lt;math&gt;u=g\text{ on }\partial\Omega,&lt;/math&gt;

then ''u'' can be obtained as the minimizer of the [[Dirichlet's energy]] 

:&lt;math&gt;E[v(x)] = \int_\Omega \left(\frac{1}{2}|\nabla v|^2 - vf\right)\,\mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt; 

amongst all twice differentiable functions &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;v=g&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt; (provided that there exists at least one function making the Dirichlet's integral finite). This concept is named after the German mathematician [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]].

==History==
Since the Dirichlet's integral is bounded from below, the existence of an [[infimum]] is guaranteed. That this infimum is attained was taken for granted by [[Riemann]] (who coined the term ''Dirichlet's principle'') and others until [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]] gave an example of a functional that does not attain its minimum. [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] later justified Riemann's use of Dirichlet's principle.

A '''disassembler''' is a [[computer program]] that translates [[machine language]] into [[assembly language]]—the inverse operation to that of an [[Assembly language#Assembler|assembler]]. A disassembler differs from a [[decompiler]], which targets a [[high-level language]] rather than an assembly language. Disassembly, the output of a disassembler, is often formatted for human-readability rather than suitability for input to an assembler, making it principally a [[reverse engineering|reverse-engineering]] tool.

Assembly language [[source code]] generally permits the use of [[constant (programming)|constant]]s and programmer [[comment (computer programming)|comment]]s. These are usually removed from the assembled [[machine code]] by the assembler. If so, a disassembler operating on the machine code would produce disassembly lacking these constants and comments; the disassembled output becomes more difficult for a human to interpret than the original annotated source code. Some disassemblers provide a built-in code commenting feature where the generated output gets enriched with comments regarding called API functions or parameters of called functions. Some disassemblers make use of the [[symbolic debugging]] information present in object files such as [[Executable and Linking Format|ELF]]. For example, [[Interactive Disassembler|IDA]] allows the human user to make up mnemonic symbols for values or regions of code in an interactive session: human insight applied to the disassembly process often parallels human creativity in the code writing process.

On [[complex instruction set computer|CISC]] platforms with variable-width instructions, more than one disassembly may be correct. Disassemblers do not handle code that varies during execution.

==Problems of disassembly==
Writing a disassembler which produces code which, when assembled, produces exactly the original binary is possible; however, there are often differences. This poses demands on the expressivity of the assembler. For example, an x86 assembler takes an arbitrary choice between two binary codes for something as simple as &lt;code&gt;MOV AX,BX&lt;/code&gt;. If the original code uses the other choice, the original code simply cannot be reproduced at any given point in time. However, even when a fully correct disassembly is produced, problems remain if the program requires modification. For example, the same machine language jump instruction can be generated by assembly code to jump to a specified location (for example, to execute specific code), or to jump to a specified number of bytes (for example, to skip over an unwanted branch). A disassembler cannot know what is intended, and may use either syntax to generate a disassembly which reproduces the original binary. However, if a programmer wants to add instructions between the jump instruction and its destination, it is necessary to understand the program's operation to determine whether the jump should be absolute or relative, i.e., whether its destination should remain at a fixed location, or be moved so as to skip both the original and added instructions.

== Examples of disassemblers ==
&lt;!-- ...that are well-known, *and* have Wikipedia articles. --&gt;
A disassembler may be stand-alone or interactive. A stand-alone disassembler, when executed, generates an assembly language file which can be examined; an interactive one shows the effect of any change the user makes immediately. For example, the disassembler may initially not know that a section of the program is actually code, and treat it as data; if the user specifies that it is code, the resulting disassembled code is shown immediately, allowing the user to examine it and take further action during the same run.

Any interactive [[debugger]] will include some way of viewing the disassembly of the program being debugged. Often, the same disassembly tool will be packaged as a standalone disassembler distributed along with the debugger. For example, [[objdump]], part of [[GNU Binutils]], is related to the interactive debugger [[gdb]].

== Disassemblers and emulators==
A dynamic disassembler can be incorporated into the output of an [[emulator]] or [[hypervisor]] to 'trace out', line-by-line, the real time execution of any executed machine instructions. In this case, as well as lines containing the disassembled machine code, the register(s) and/or data change(s) (or any other changes of "[[state (computer science)|state]]", such as condition codes) that each individual instruction causes can be shown alongside or beneath the disassembled instruction. This provides extremely powerful debugging information for ultimate problem resolution, although the size of the resultant output can sometimes be quite large, especially if active for an entire program's execution. OLIVER provided these features from the early 1970s as part of its [[CICS]] debugging product offering and is now to be found incorporated into the [[XPEDITER]] product from [[Compuware]].

{{Economic systems sidebar}}
'''Economic democracy''' is a [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] philosophy that proposes to shift decision-making power from [[Management|corporate managers]] and [[Shareholder|corporate shareholders]] to a larger group of [[stakeholder theory|public stakeholders]] that includes workers, customers, suppliers, neighbors and the broader public. No single definition or approach encompasses economic democracy, but most proponents claim that modern property relations [[externality|externalize]] costs, subordinate the general well-being to private profit and deny the polity a democratic voice in economic policy decisions.{{sfn|Smith|2005}} In addition to these moral concerns, economic democracy makes practical claims, such as that it can compensate for [[capitalism]]'s inherent [[effective demand]] gap.{{sfn|Harvey|2010|p=107}}

Proponents of economic democracy generally argue that modern capitalism periodically results in economic crises characterized by deficiency of effective demand as society is unable to earn enough income to purchase its output production. [[Corporation|Corporate]] monopoly of [[Common-pool resource|common resources]] typically creates [[artificial scarcity]], resulting in socio-economic imbalances that restrict workers from access to economic opportunity and diminish consumer [[purchasing power]].{{sfn|George|1912}}{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} Economic democracy has been proposed as a component of larger socioeconomic ideologies, as a stand-alone theory and as a variety of reform agendas. For example, as a means to securing full [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic rights]], it opens a path to full [[Civil Rights|political rights]], defined as including the former.{{sfn|Smith|2005}} Both market and non-market theories of economic democracy have been proposed. As a reform agenda, supporting theories and real-world examples range from [[decentralization]] and [[economic liberalism|economic liberalization]] to [[Cooperative|democratic cooperatives]], [[public banking]], [[fair trade]] and the [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalization]] of [[Local food|food production]] and [[Local currency|currency]].
{{toclimit|3}}

== Deficiency of effective demand ==
According to many analysts, deficiency of effective demand is the most fundamental economic problem. That is, modern society does not earn enough income to purchase its output. For example, [[geographer]] [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] claims, "Workers spending their wages is one source of effective demand, but the total wage bill is always less than the total capital in circulation (otherwise there would be no profit), so the purchase of wage goods that sustain daily life (even with a suburban lifestyle) is never sufficient for the profitable sale of the total output".{{sfn|Harvey|2010|p=107}} While balanced [[Mixed economy|mixed economies]] have existed briefly throughout history, veteran Project Manager for the [[U.S. Treasury Department]], [[Richard C. Cook]] and other critics claim that [[Planned economy|command economies]] are predominate, citing [[state capitalism]] and [[imperialism]] as related. As common resources are monopolized by imperial centers of wealth and power, conditions of scarcity are imposed artificially upon the majority, resulting in large-scale socio-economic imbalance.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}}

In the [[Georgist]] view of any [[economics|economic system]], "wealth" includes all material things produced by labor for the satisfaction of human desires and having [[exchange value]]. [[Land (economics)|Land]], [[Labour (economics)|labor]] and capital are generally considered the essential factors in producing wealth. Land includes all natural opportunities and forces. Labor includes all human exertion. [[Capital (economics)|Capital]] includes the portion of wealth devoted to producing more wealth. While the income of any individual might include proceeds from any combination of these three sources—land, labor and capital are generally considered mutually exclusive factors in economic models of the production and distribution of wealth. According to [[Henry George]]: "People seek to satisfy their desires with the least exertion".{{sfn|George|1912|date=January 2012}} Human beings interact with nature to produce goods and services that other human beings need or desire. The laws and [[Custom (law)|customs]] that govern the relationships among these entities constitute the economic structure of a given society.

Alternately, [[David Schweickart]] asserts in his book, ''After Capitalism'': "The structure of a capitalist society consists of three basic components:

* "The bulk of the [[means of production]] are privately owned, either directly by individuals or by corporations that are themselves owned by private individuals.
* "Products are exchanged in a market -- that is to say, goods and services are bought and sold at prices determined for the most part by competition and not by some governmental pricing authority. Individual enterprises compete with one another in providing goods and services to consumers, each enterprise trying to make a profit. This competition is the primary determinant of prices.
* "Most of the people who work for pay in this society work for other people, who own the means of production. Most working people are '[[wage labour]]ers'".{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=22–23}}

[[Supply and demand]] are generally accepted as market functions for establishing [[price]]s. Organisations typically endeavor to 1) minimize the [[Cost-of-production theory of value|cost of production]]; 2) increase sales; in order to 3) maximize profits. But, according to David Schweickart, if "those who produce the goods and services of society are paid less than their productive contribution", then as consumers they cannot buy all the goods produced, and investor confidence tends to decline, triggering declines in production and employment. Such economic instability stems from a central contradiction: Wages are both a cost of production and an essential source of [[effective demand]] (needs or desires backed with purchasing power), {{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=36, 40–43, 95}} resulting in deficiency of effective demand along with a growing interest in economic democracy.

In chapter 3 of his book, "Community Organizing: Theory and Practice", [[Douglas Biklen|Douglas P. Biklen]] discusses a variety of perspectives on "The Making of Social Problems". One of those views suggests that "writers and organizers who define social problems in terms of social and economic democracy see problems not as the experiences of poor people, but as the relationship of poverty to wealth and exploitation". Biklen states that according to this viewpoint:

{{Quote|[C]orporate power, upper class power, uneven distribution of wealth and prejudice cause social problems... [T]he problem is not one of poverty, but of enormous wealth. The problem is not one of gaps or cracks in an otherwise fine system but of a system which perpetuates prejudicial views concerning race, sex, age, and disability. The problem is not one of incompetence but of barriers to education, jobs, and power. Accordingly, as long as there is a deep gulf between social classes, both in terms of wealth, power, and outlook, traditional social programs will act merely as palliatives to oppression and not as a way of ending large scale human misery. This perspective is, above all, eclectic. It embraces Marx's criticism of social class inequality but is not only a social class analysis. It is anti-racist, but it is not only a theory of race equality. It favors democratic distribution of power but is also an economic theory. It can be called a social and economic democracy perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biklen|first=Douglas P.|title=Community Organizing: Theory and Practice|year=1983|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J. 07632|isbn=0-13-153676-1|pages=41, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

=== Savings, investment and unemployment ===

In his 1879 book ''Progress and Poverty'', Henry George argued that a majority of wealth created in a "free market" economy was appropriated by land owners and [[monopoly|monopolists]] through [[economic rent]]s, and that concentration of such [[Unearned income|unearned wealth]] was the root cause of poverty.{{sfn|George|1912|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} "Behind the abstraction known as 'the market' lurks a set of institutions designed to maximize the wealth and power of the most privileged group of people in the world—the creditor-rentier class of the first world and their junior partners in the third".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Henwood | first = Doug | title = Wall Street: How It Works and For Whom | publisher = Verso | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-86091-495-2 | page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schweickart claimed that private savings are not only unnecessary for economic growth, they are often harmful to the overall economy.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=17}}

In an advanced industrial society, business credit is necessary for a healthy economy. A business that wants to expand production needs to command the labor of others, and money is the default mechanism for exercising this authority.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} It is often cheaper for a business to borrow capital from a bank than to stockpile cash.

If private savings are loaned out to entrepreneurs who use them to buy raw materials and hire workers, then aggregate demand is not reduced.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} However, when private savings are not reinvested, the whole economy suffers recession, unemployment, and disappearance of savings {{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=42–43}} which characterize deficiency of effective demand.

In this view, unemployment is not an aberration, indicating any sort of systemic malfunction. Rather, unemployment is a necessary structural feature of capitalism, intended to discipline the workforce. If unemployment is too low, workers make wage demands that either cut into profits to an extent that jeopardizes future investment, or are passed on to consumers, thus generating inflationary instability. Schweickart suggested, "Capitalism cannot be a full-employment economy, except in the very short term. For unemployment is the "[[invisible hand]]"—carrying a stick—that keeps the workforce in line."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=97}} In this view, [[Adam Smith|Adam Smith's]] "invisible hand" does not seem reliable to guide economic forces on a large scale.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Assuming business credit could come from public sources rather than from private savers, Schweickart and other analysts consider interest payments to private savers both undeserved and unnecessary for economic growth. Moreover, the personal decision to save rather than consume decreases aggregate demand, increases the likelihood of unemployment, and exacerbates the tendency toward economic stagnation. Since wealthy people tend to save more than poor people, the propensity of an economy to slump because of excess saving becomes ever more acute as a society becomes more affluent.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett suggested that health and social problems are significantly worse in more unequal wealthy nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilkinson | first = Richard G | title = The Spirit Level: Why Greater Equality Makes Societies Stronger | publisher = Bloomsbury Press | isbn = 978-1-60819-036-2 |year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that there are "pernicious effects that inequality has on societies: eroding trust, increasing anxiety and illness, (and) encouraging excessive consumption"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Jarvis | first = Brooke |url= http://www.yesmagazine.org/happiness/want-the-good-life-your-neighbors-need-it-too | title = Equality and the Good Life: Interview with Richard Wilkinson, author of The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better | work = yesmagazine.org |date = March 4, 2010 |accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monopoly power versus purchasing power ===

Regarding a social and economic democracy perspective on social problems, Douglas P. Biklen states:

{{quote|The theme of profit superseding individual well-being flows through this antimonopoly view of social problems. On the one hand, poor and middle income people find their lives deformed by their meager or nonexistent ability to pay for goods and services. Wealthy people, on the other hand, find that their relative position, in terms of wealth and power, grows with their ability to maintain the gulf between social classes. Thus monopolies or concentrated wealth plays a large part in creating social problems. Indeed, one might say, monopolies and policies which promote the former or concentrations of wealth are the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biklen|first=Douglas P.|title=Community Organizing: Theory and Practice|year=1983|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|location=Englewood Cliffs, N. J. 07632|isbn=0-13-153676-1|pages=43, 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

The discipline of economics is largely a study of [[scarcity]] management; "the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robbins|first=Lionel|title=An Essay On The Nature And Significance Of Economic Science|year=1932|publisher=MacMillan &amp; Co, Ltd|location=St. Martin's Street, London|asin=B000XG8SV4|pages=15|url=https://mises.org/books/robbinsessay2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absent scarcity and alternative uses of available resources, many analysts claim there is no [[economic problem]]". For example, Richard C. Cook asserts that conditions of scarcity are artificially maintained by [[Corporate finance|corporate structures]] that confine [[Abundance (economics)|abundance]] to an exclusively entitled minority. In this view, socio-economic imbalance stems not from a failure to manage limited [[Resource (economics)|resources]] in a world of scarcity, but from mismanagement of virtually unlimited abundance and prosperity.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} American businessman Edward Kellogg (1790–1858) supports this perspective in his 1849 book, ''Labor and Other Capital'', where he states:

{{quote|Money power is not only the most governing and influential, but it is also the most unjust and deceitful of all earthly powers. It entails upon millions excessive toil, poverty and want, while it keeps them ignorant of the cause of their sufferings; for, with their tacit consent, it silently transfers a large share of their earnings into the hands of others, who have never lifted a finger to perform any productive labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kellogg |first=Edward |last2=Campbell |first2=Alexander |title=Labor and Other Capital |year=1971 |publisher=Scholar's Bookshelf |isbn=0-678-00803-5 |page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While he considers these functions a public wrong, Kellogg also asserted the responsibility of the public to find and implement a remedy. Generally considered [[Monopoly|monopoly power]], some view this "public wrong" as the most influential factor in [[artificial scarcity]]. For example, Henry George further suggested:

{{quote|There is in reality no conflict between labor and capital; the true conflict is between labor and monopoly... Abolish the monopoly that forbids men to employ themselves and capital could not possibly oppress labor... [R]emove the cause of that injustice which deprives the laborer of the capital his toil creates and the sharp distinction between capitalist and laborer would, in fact, cease to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = George | first = Henry | title = Protection or Free Trade: An Examination of the Tariff Question, With Especial Regard to the Interests of Labor | year = 1998 | publisher = Robert Schalkenbach Foundation | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-911312-83-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

For example, many analysts consider [[invention]] a "more or less costless store of knowledge, captured by monopoly capital and protected in order to make it secret and a 'rare and scarce commodity', for sale at monopoly prices. So far as invention is concerned, a price is put on them not because they are scarce but in order to make them scarce to those who want to use them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Penrose |first=Edith Tilton |title=The International Patent System | publisher = Johns Hopkins Press | location = Baltimore |year=1951 | oclc = 181961 |page=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nadudere |first=Dan |title=The Political Economy of Imperialism |year=1977 |publisher=Zed Books |page=251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Smith|2007|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} Patent monopolies raise share prices above tangible labor value. The difference between labor-value and monopoly-value raises goods prices, and is collected as "profit" by intermediaries who have contributed nothing to earn it.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Analysts generally agree that such conditions typically result in a deficiency of effective demand. Labor does not earn enough to buy what enterprises produce. For example, Richard C. Cook maintains that the difference between earnings and prices is typically appropriated by industrial and banking centers of capital through monopoly control of finance and other market resources. Such exclusive entitlement tends to artificially impose conditions of economic scarcity upon the majority of the population.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} While the accelerating advance of technology, developed and maintained by labor, tends to generate abundance, this process depresses wages as workers are replaced by machines, ironically minimizing the purchasing power of workers in the market. {{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} According to Jack Rasmus, author of ''The Trillion Dollar Income Shift'', in June 2006, investment bank Goldman Sachs reported: "The most important contribution to the higher profit margins over the past five years has been a decline in Labor's share of national income." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rasmus|first=Jack|title=The Trillion Dollar Income Shift, Part 1|journal=Z Magazine|date=February 2007|volume=20|issue=2|pages=44–49|url=http://www.armory.com/~rstevew/Wealth/JackRasmusZMag.txt|accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enclosure of the commons ===
Artificially restricted access of labor to common resources is generally considered monopoly or [[enclosure|enclosure of the commons]]. Due to the economic imbalance inherently imposed, such monopoly structures tend to be centrally dictated by law, and must be maintained by military force, trade agreements, or both.{{sfn|George|1912|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

In 1911, American journalist [[Ambrose Bierce]] defined "land" as:

{{quote|A part of the earth's surface, considered as property. The theory that land is property subject to private ownership and control is the foundation of modern society.... Carried to its logical conclusion, it means that some have the right to prevent others from living; for the right to own implies the right exclusively to occupy; and in fact laws of trespass are enacted wherever property in land is recognized. It follows that if the whole area of terra firma is owned by A, B and C, there will be no place for D, E, F and G to be born, or, born as trespassers, to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bierce | first = Ambrose | authorlink = Ambrose Bierce | title = [[The Devil's Dictionary]] | year = 1911 | oclc = 49294964}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In ''The Servile State'' (1912), [[Hilaire Belloc]] referred to the [[Enclosure|Enclosures Movement]] when he said, "England was already captured by a wealthy [[oligarchy]] before the series of great [[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] discoveries began". If you sought the accumulated wealth preliminary to launching new industry, "you had to turn to the class which had already monopolized the bulk of the means of production in England. The rich men alone could furnish you with those supplies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Belloc|first=Hilaire|title=The Servile State|year=1912|publisher=T. N. Foulis|location=91 Great Russell Street, London, W.C. 15 Frederick Street, Edinburgh|asin=B004QGY2M6|pages=72, 74|url=https://archive.org/stream/servilestate00belluoft/servilestate00belluoft_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Peter Barnes (entrepreneur)|Peter Barnes]], author of ''Capitalism 3.0'', when Adam Smith wrote ''The Wealth of Nations'' in 1776, the dominant form of business was partnership, in which regional groups of co-workers ran co-owned businesses. From this perspective, many considered the corporate model—stock sold to strangers—inherently prone to fraud. While numerous scandals historically support this dim view of corporate policy, small partnerships could not possibly compete with the aggregate capital generated by corporate [[economies of scale]]. The greatest advantage of corporations over any other business model is their ability to raise capital from strangers. The corporate model benefits from laws that limit stockholders' liability to the amounts they have invested.{{sfn|Barnes|2006}}

In ''A Preface To Economic Democracy'', [[Robert A. Dahl]] suggests that [[Agriculture|agrarian]] economy and society in the early United States "underwent a [[Industrial Revolution|revolutionary]] transformation into a new system of commercial and industrial capitalism that automatically generated vast [[Economic inequality|inequalities]] of wealth, income, [[Social status|status]], and [[Economic power|power]]." Dahl claims that such inequalities result from the "[[liberty]] to accumulate unlimited [[Factors of production|economic resources]] and to organize economic activity into [[Hierarchy|hierarchically]] governed enterprises."{{sfn|Dahl|1985|p=50}}

=== The rise of corporations and ending labor shortage ===
According to author Greg MacLeod, the concept of the corporation originated in Roman times. However, "the modern business corporation evolved radically from its ancient roots into a form with little relation to the purpose as understood by historians of law." John Davis, a legal historian, noted that the precursor of the business corporation was the first [[monastery]], established in the sixth century, the purpose of which was to serve society. Most business corporations before 1900 developed in Great Britain, where they were established by [[royal charter]], with the expectation of contributions to society. Incorporation was a privilege granted in return for service to the crown or the nation. MacLeod goes on to say:

{{quote|A corporation is considered by the law to exist as a legal person. In the [[Middle Ages]] it was called a "persona ficta". This is a very useful way of looking at a business corporation, because it suggests correctly that the [[corporate personhood|corporate person]] has a certain personality. It has duties and responsibilities vested unto it by the legitimate government or society that fostered it. The corporate person receives great benefits from society – and, in return, it must exercise great responsibilities. One of the most basic responsibilities is job creation, a fundamental need in any society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = MacLeod | first = Greg | title = The Public Purpose Corporation | journal = Harvard International Review | date = 2009-04-04 | url = http://hir.harvard.edu/the-mondragon-experiment | accessdate = 2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

By the mid-nineteenth century, corporations could live forever, engage in any legal activity, and merge with or acquire other corporations. In 1886, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] legally recognized corporations as “persons”, entitled under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the same protections as living [[Citizenship|citizens]]. Unlike average citizens, large corporations had large flows of money at their disposal. With this money they can hire [[Lobbying|lobbyists]], donate copiously to politicians, and sway [[public opinion]].

But, despite [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] rulings, the modern corporation is not a real person. Rather, the publicly traded stock corporation is what Barnes terms an "[[automaton]]", explicitly designed to maximize return to its owners. A corporation never sleeps or slows down. It externalizes as many costs as possible, and never reaches an upper limit of profitability, because no such limit has yet been established. As a result, corporations keep getting larger. In 1955, sales of the [[Fortune 500]] accounted for one-third of U.S. gross domestic product. By 2004 they commanded two-thirds. In other words, these few hundred corporations replaced smaller firms organized as partnerships or [[Sole proprietorship|proprietorships]]. Corporations have established a homogeneous global playing field around which they can freely move raw materials, labor, capital, finished products, tax-paying obligations, and profits. Thus, corporate franchise has become a perpetual grant of [[sovereignty]], including [[immortality]], [[Self-governance|self-government]], and [[limited liability]]. By the end of the twentieth century, corporate power—both economic and political—stretched worldwide. International agreements not only lowered [[tariff]]s but extended corporate [[Property|property rights]] and reduced the ability of sovereign nations to regulate corporations.{{sfn|Barnes|2006|p=}}

David Schweickart submits that such "hypermobility of capital" generates economic and political insecurity.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} "If the search for lower wages comes to dominate the movement of capital, the result will be not only a lowering of worldwide wage disparities (the good to which some economists point) but also a lowering of total global income (a straight-out utilitarian bad)."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=96}} Jack Rasmus, author of ''The War At Home'' and ''The Trillion Dollar Income Shift'', argues that the increasing concentration of corporate power is a cause of the large-scale debt, unemployment, and poverty characteristic of economic [[recession]] and [[depression (economics)|depression]]. According to Rasmus, income inequality in contemporary America increased as the relative share of income for corporations and the wealthiest one percent of households rose while income shares declined for 80-percent of the United States workforce. After rising steadily for three decades after World War II, the standard of living for most American workers has sharply declined between the mid-1970s to the present. Rasmus likens the widening income gap in contemporary American society to the decade leading up to the [[Great Depression]], estimating "well over $1 trillion in income is transferred annually from the roughly 90 million working class families in America to corporations and the wealthiest non-working-class households. While a hundred new billionaires were created since 2001, [[real wages|real weekly earnings]] for 100 million workers are less in 2007 than in 1980 when [[Ronald Reagan]] took office".

According to economist [[Richard D. Wolff]], the 1970s brought an end to the labor shortage which had facilitated more than a century of rising average [[real wage]]s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard D. Wolff|Wolff, Richard D.]] (2012). ''[http://www.democracyatwork.info/ Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism].'' [[Haymarket Books]]. {{ISBN|1608462471}}.

* "...the combination of computerization, exported jobs, women surging into the labor market, and a new wave of immigration ended the period of rising real wages in the United States."&lt;/ref&gt; Wolff says Americans responded to the resulting deficiency of effective demand by working more hours and excessive borrowing; the latter paving the way for the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]].&lt;ref name="Wolff 2012 46"&gt;[[Richard D. Wolff|Wolff, Richard D.]] (2012). ''[http://www.democracyatwork.info/ Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism].'' [[Haymarket Books]]. {{ISBN|1608462471}}.

* "Across the 1980s and 1990s and up to 2007, US families worked and borrowed more and more, while real wages stagnated... When they began defaulting on their debts - the system crashed."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imperialism ===
According to David Harvey, "the export of capital and the cultivation of new markets around the world" is a solution "as old as capitalism itself" for the deficiency of effective demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=David|title=The Enigma of Capital: And the Crises of Capitalism|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=USA|isbn=0199836841|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Imperialism, as defined by ''Dictionary of Human Geography'', is "the creation and/or maintenance of an unequal economic, cultural, and territorial relationship, usually between states and often in the form of an empire, based on domination and subordination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnston | first = Ronald John | year = 2000 |title = The Dictionary of Human Geography | edition = 4th | publisher =Wiley-Blackwell | page=375 | isbn = 0-631-20561-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; "These geographic shifts", according to David Harvey, "are the heart of uneven geographic development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvey|first=David|title=Reading Marx’s Capital Vol 1 – Class 12, Chapters 26-33|url=http://davidharvey.org/2008/09/capital-class-12/|work=Video Lecture|publisher=WordPress|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vladimir Lenin]] viewed imperialism as the highest stage of capitalism. He asserted that the merging of banks and industrial cartels gave rise to finance capital, which was then exported (rather than goods) in pursuit of greater profits than the home market could offer. Political and financial power became divided among international monopolist firms and European states, colonizing large parts of the world in support of their businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lenin |first=Vladimir |title=Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism |year=1916 |place=London |publisher=Lawrence and Wishart}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to analyst Michael Parenti, imperialism is "the process whereby the dominant politico-economic interests of one nation expropriate for their own enrichment the land, labor, raw materials, and markets of another people."&lt;ref name="Parenti 1995 3"&gt;{{cite book |title=Against Empire |last=Parenti |first=Michael |year=1995 |publisher=City Lights Publishers |isbn=978-0-87286-298-2 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parenti says imperialism is older than capitalism. Given its expansionist nature, capitalism has little inclination to stay home. While he conceded imperialism is not typically recognized as a legitimate allegation about the United States, Parenti argued:

{{quote|Emperors and conquistadors were interested mostly in plunder and tribute, gold and glory. Capitalist imperialism differs from these earlier forms in the way it systematically accumulates capital through the organized exploitation of labor and the penetration of overseas markets. Capitalist imperialism invests in other countries, transforming and dominating their economies, cultures, and political life, integrating their financial and productive structures into an international system of capital accumulation.&lt;ref name="Parenti 1995 3"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In his book, ''The Political Struggle for the 21st century'', [[J. W. Smith|J.W. Smith]] examines the economic basis for the history of imperial civilization. On a global scale, he says developed nations tended to impede or prohibit the economic and technological advancement of weaker developing countries through the military force, martial law, and inequitable practices of trade that typically characterize [[colonialism]]. Rhetorically termed as "[[survival of the fittest]]", or "[[might makes right]]", such economic crises stem from the imbalances imposed by [[corporate imperialism]]. Just as cities in the [[Middle Ages]] monopolized the [[means of production]] by conquering and controlling the sources of raw materials and countryside markets, Smith claims that contemporary centers of capital now control our present world through private monopoly of public resources sometimes known as "the commons". Through inequalities of trade, developing countries are overcharged for import of manufactured goods and underpaid for raw material exports, as wealth is siphoned from the periphery of empire and hoarded at the imperial-centers-of-capital:

{{Quote|Over eight-hundred years ago the powerful of the city-states of Europe learned to control the resources and markets of the countryside by raiding and destroying others’ primitive industrial capital, thus openly monopolizing that capital and establishing and maintaining extreme inequality of pay. This low pay siphoned the wealth of the countryside to the imperial-centers-of-capital. The powerful had learned to plunder-by-trade and have been refining those skills ever since.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p=}}|sign=|source=}}

Smith goes on to say that, like other financial empires in history, the contemporary model forms alliances necessary to develop and control wealth, keeping peripheral nations impoverished providers of cheap resources for the imperial capital centers. Belloc estimated that, during the British Enclosures, "perhaps half of the whole population was [[Proletariat|proletarian]]", while roughly the other "half" owned and controlled the means of production. Under modern Capitalism, J.W. Smith claimed that fewer than 500 individuals possess more wealth than half of the earth's population. The wealth of 1/2 of 1-percent of the United States population roughly equals that of the lower 90-percent. {{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Richard Cook claimed that the United States maintained stability by economically dominating the world as a means of filling the gap between production and consumption. Beginning with loans to European combatants during World War I, and continuing through the [[lend-lease]] program of World War II, U.S. domination of trade peaked through economic recovery measures following those wars. Though forming the basis for U.S. prosperity during the 1950s and 1960s, U.S trade domination was exhausted by the mid-1970s, when the United States implemented a policy known as [[dollar hegemony]], intended to stabilize the economy.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 2|2007}}

== Alternative models ==

Advocating for an "alternative economic system free of capitalism's structural flaws",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolff|first1=Richard D|title=Democracy At Work: A Cure For Capitalism|date=2012|publisher=Haymarket Books|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-60846-247-6|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; economist Richard D. Wolff says reform agendas are fundamentally inadequate, given that capitalist corporations, the dominant institutions of the existing system, retain the incentives and the resources to undo any sort of reform policy. For example, Wolff goes on to say:

{{quote|The [[New Deal]]–era taxes on business and the rich and [[regulation]]s of [[Entrepreneurship|enterprise]] behavior proved vulnerable and unsustainable. The enemies of the New Deal had the incentives ([[profit maximization]]) and the resources (their returns on investments) to undo many of its reforms after [[World War II]], with ever-greater effect in the period since the 1970s. They systematically evaded, then weakened, the taxes and regulations of the New Deal, and eventually, when politically possible, eliminated them altogether. Business profits funded the parties, politicians, public relations campaigns, and professional think tanks that together shaped the real social effects and historical decline of government economic regulation. Examples include the destruction of the [[Glass-Steagall Act]], the current assault on [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], the shift in the federal tax burden from business to individuals and from upper- to middle-income individuals, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolff|first1=Richard D.|title=Democracy At Work: A Cure For Capitalism|date=2012|publisher=Haymarket Books|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-60846-247-6|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

According to David Schweickart, a serious critique of any problem cannot be content to merely note the negative features of the existing [[scientific modelling|model]]. Instead, we must specify precisely the structural features of an alternative: "But if we want to do more than simply denounce the evils of capitalism, we must confront the claim that 'there is no alternative'—by proposing one."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=45}} Schweickart argued that both full employment and guaranteed basic income are impossible under the restrictions of the U.S. economic system for two primary reasons: a) unemployment is an essential feature of capitalism, not an indication of systemic failure;{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=97}} and b) while capitalism thrives under [[polyarchy]], it is not compatible with genuine democracy.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=151}} Assuming these "democratic deficits" significantly impact the management of both the workplace and new investment,{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=46}} many proponents of economic democracy tend to favor the creation and implementation of a new economic model over reform of the existing one.

For example, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]] claimed "Communism forgets that life is individual. Capitalism forgets that life is social, and the Kingdom of Brotherhood is found neither in the thesis of Communism nor the antithesis of Capitalism but in a higher synthesis. It is found in a higher synthesis that combines the truths of both".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.writespirit.net/inspirational_talks/political/martin_luther_king_talks/where_do_we_go_from_here/ |title=Where Do We Go From Here |first=Martin Luther Jr |last= King|work=writespirit.net | date = August 16, 1967 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the gap between productivity and purchasing power, Dr. King maintained:

{{quote|The problem indicates that our emphasis must be two-fold. We must create full employment or we must create incomes. People must be made consumers by one method or the other. Once they are placed in this position, we need to be concerned that the potential of the individual is not wasted. New forms of work that enhance the social good will have to be devised for those for whom traditional jobs are not available.{{sfn|King|1968|p=163}}|sign=|source=}}

According to historian and political economist, [[Gar Alperovitz]]: "King’s final judgment stands as instructive evidence of his understanding of the nature of systemic challenge — and also as a reminder that given the failures of both traditional socialism and corporate capitalism, it is time to get serious about clarifying not only the question of strategy, but what, in fact, the meaning of changing the system in a truly democratic direction might one day entail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alperovitz|first1=Gar|title=What Then Must We Do?: Straight Talk About The Next American Revolution|date=2013|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|location=White River Junction, VT|isbn=978-160358-491-3|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade unionist and social activist Allan Engler argued further that economic democracy was the working-class alternative to capitalism. In his book, "Economic Democracy", Engler stated:

{{quote|When economic democracy – a world of human equality, democracy and cooperation – is the alternative, capitalism will no longer be seen as a lesser evil. When the working class, not a revolutionary party, is the agency of social transformation, change will be based on workplace organization, community mobilizations and democratic political action. The goal will be to transform capitalism into economic democracy through gains and reforms that improve living conditions while methodically replacing wealth-holders' entitlement with human entitlement, capitalist ownership with community ownership and master-servant relations with workplace democracy.{{sfn|Engler|2010|p=8}}|sign=|source=}}

Assuming that "democracy is not just a political value, but one with profound economic implications, the problem is not to choose between [[Planned economy|plan]] and [[Market economy|market]], but to integrate these institutions into a democratic framework".&lt;ref name="Schweickart Essay"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Schweickart |first=David |title=Economic Democracy: A Worthy Socialism That Would Really Work |journal=Science &amp; Society |volume=56| issue=1 | pages=9–38|date=Spring 1992 |url=http://homepages.luc.edu/~dschwei/economicdemocracy.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like capitalism, economic democracy can be defined in terms of three basic features:

* Worker self-management: each productive enterprise is controlled democratically by its workers.
* Social control of investment: funds for new investment are returned to the economy through a network of public investment banks.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}
* The market: enterprises interact with one another and with consumers in an environment largely free of governmental price controls. Raw materials, instruments of production and consumer goods are all bought and sold at prices largely determined by the forces of supply and demand.

In real-world practice, Schweickart concedes economic democracy will be more complicated and less "pure" than his model. However, to grasp the nature of the system and to understand its essential dynamic, it is important to have a clear picture of the basic structure. Capitalism is characterized by private ownership of productive resources, the market, and wage labor. The Soviet economic model subordinated private ownership of productive resources to public ownership by collectivizing farms and factories. It further subordinated the market to central planning—but retained the institution of wage labor.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=47}}

Most proposed models for economic democracy generally begin with democratizing the workplace and the ownership of capital. Other proposals advocate replacing the market with some form of planning, as well.

=== Worker self-management ===
{{Main|Worker self-management}}In worker self-management, each productive enterprise is controlled by those who work there. Workers are responsible for the operation of the facility, including organization, discipline, production techniques, and the nature, price, and distribution of products. Decisions concerning distribution are made democratically. Problems of authority delegation are solved by democratic representation. Management is chosen by the worker, not appointed by the State, not elected by the community at large and not selected by a board of directors elected by [[stockholder]]s. Ultimate authority rests with the enterprise's workers, following the one-person, one-vote principle.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=47–48}}

According to veteran [[World Bank]] economic adviser [[David Ellerman|David P. Ellerman]] it's the [[employment contract]] that needs to be abolished, not private property. In other words, "a firm can be socialized and yet remain 'private' in the sense of not being government-owned."{{sfn|Ellerman|1990|p=56}} In his book, "The Democratic Firm", Ellerman stated:

{{quote|In the world today, the main form of enterprise is based on renting human beings ([[private company|privately]] or [[public enterprise|publicly]]). Our task is to construct the alternative. In the alternative type of firm, employment by the firm is replaced with membership in the firm. Economic democracy requires the abolition of the employment relation, not the abolition of [[private property]]. Democracy can be married with private property in the workplace; the result of the union is the democratic worker-owned firm.{{sfn|Ellerman|1990|pp=44–49}}|sign=|source=}}

Alternately, in Schweickart's model, workers control the workplace, but they do not "own" the means of production. Productive resources are regarded as the collective property of the society. Workers run the enterprise, use its capital assets as they see fit, and distribute the profits among themselves. Here, societal "ownership" of the enterprise manifests itself in two ways: 1) All firms pay tax on their [[capital asset]]s, which goes into society's investment fund. In effect, workers rent capital assets from society. 2) Firms are required to preserve the value of the [[capital stock]] entrusted to them. This means that a [[depreciation]] fund must be maintained to repair or replace existing capital stock. This money may be spent on capital replacements or improvements, but not to supplement workers' incomes. {{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=47–49}}

Italy's [[Legacoop]] and Spain's [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon]] multi-sectoral worker-cooperatives have both been able to reach significant scale and demonstrate long-term sustainability. According to a study conducted by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the greatest lesson to be learned from these European experiences is the importance of developing an economically integrated network of cooperatives rather than a single cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoyt|first1=Lorlene|last2=Luviene|first2=Nicholas|last3=Stitely|first3=Amy|title=Sustainable Economic Democracy: Worker Cooperatives for the 21st Century|url=http://web.mit.edu/colab/pdf/papers/Sustainable_Economic_Democracy.pdf|website=colab.mit.edu|publisher=MIT Community Innovators Lab  with support from the Barr Foundation|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report goes on to say:

{{quote|In a market based economy the cooperative business form suffers from several strategic challenges when operating independently. One worker cooperative on its own is most likely doomed to fail in a highly competitive global economy. However, an ecosystem of several worker cooperatives and support organizations can create an infrastructure that leads to sustained growth and expansion. In Mondragon the cooperative network expanded from a single cooperative polytechnic school to a network of 256 industrial, retail, finance, educational, and research and development firms.}}

=== Social control of investment ===
While there is no single approach or 'blueprint' for social control of investment, many strategies have been proposed. For example, [[Gar Alperovitz]] claims many real-world strategies have already emerged to democratize and decentralize the ownership of wealth and capital. In addition to worker cooperatives, Alperovitz highlights ESOPs, [[credit union]]s and other cooperative forms, [[social enterprise]]s, municipally-owned utilities and [[public bank]]s as starting points for what he has termed a "[[Pluralist commonwealth|Pluralist Commonwealth]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alperovitz|first1=Gar|title=What Then Must We Do?: Straight Talk about the Next American Revolution|date=May 1, 2013|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|location=85 North Main Street, Suite 120, White River Junction, VT 05001|isbn=1603585044|pages=139–147|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternately, David Schweickart proposes a [[Flat tax|flat-rate tax]] on capital assets to replace all other business taxes. This "capital assets tax" is collected and invested by the central government. Funds are dispersed throughout society, first to regions and communities on a per capita basis, then to public banks in accordance with past performance, then to those firms with profitable [[project]] proposals. Profitable projects that promise increased employment are favored over those that do not. At each level, national, regional and local, legislatures decide what portion of their funds is to be used for public capital expenditures, then send the remainder to the next lower level. Associated with most banks are entrepreneurial divisions, which promote firm expansion and new firm creation. For large (regional or national) enterprises, local investment banks are complemented by regional and national investment banks. These too would be public institutions that receive their funds from the national investment fund.

Banks are public, not private, institutions that make [[Grant (money)|grants]], not loans, to business enterprises. According to Schweickart, these grants do not represent "free money", since an investment grant counts as an addition to the capital assets of the enterprise, upon which the capital-asset tax must be paid. Thus the capital assets tax functions as an interest rate. A bank grant is essentially a loan requiring [[interest]] payments but no repayment of [[Debt|principal]].{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=56}}

While an economy of worker-self-managed enterprises might tend toward lower unemployment than under capitalism - because banks are mandated to consistently prioritize investment projects that would increase employment - Schweickart notes that it does not guarantee [[full employment]]. Social control of investment serves to increase employment. If the market provides insufficient employment, the public sector becomes the [[employer of last resort]]. The original formulation of the [[Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act|U.S. Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978]] assumed that only in this way could full employment be assured in a market economy. Economic Democracy adopts this approach. Social control of investment then blocks the cyclical unemployment typical of capitalism.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=135, 136}}

=== The market ===
Hungarian historian [[Karl Polanyi]] suggested that market economies should subordinate themselves to larger societal needs. He states that human-beings, the source of [[Labour (economics)|labor]], do not reproduce for the sole purpose of providing the market with workers. In [[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]] Polanyi says that, while modern states and market economies tend to grow under capitalism, both are mutually interdependent for functional development. In order for market economies to be truly prosperous, he claims social constructs must play an essential role. Polanyi claimed that [[Land (economics)|land]], labor, and money are all [[commodities|commodified]] under capitalism, though the inherent purpose of these items was never intended "for sale"—what he labels "[[fictitious commodities]]." He says [[natural resources]] are "God-given", money is a bookkeeping entry validated by law, and labor is a human prerogative, not a personal obligation to market economies.

Schweickart's economic democracy is a form of [[market economy]], at least insofar as the allocation of [[consumer goods|consumer]] and [[capital goods]] is concerned. [[business entity|Firm]]s buy [[raw materials]] and machinery from other firms and sell their products to other enterprises or consumers. "Prices are largely [[Regulation|unregulated]] except by supply and demand, although in some cases price controls or price supports might be in order – as they are deemed in order in most real-world forms of capitalism."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Without a [[price mechanism]] sensitive to supply and demand, it is extremely difficult for a producer or planner to know what and how much to produce, and which production and marketing methods are the most efficient. Otherwise, it is difficult to motivate producers to be both efficient and [[Innovation|innovative]]. [[Competition (economics)|Market competition]] resolves these problems, to a significant if incomplete degree, in a [[Authoritarianism|non-authoritarian]], [[Bureaucracy|non-bureaucratic]] fashion.

Enterprises still strive to make a profit. However, "profit" in a worker-run firm is calculated differently than under capitalism. For a capitalist firm, labor is counted as a cost. For a worker-run enterprise it is not. Labor is not another "factor of production" on par with land and capital. Labor is the residual claimant. Workers get all that remains, once other costs, including depreciation set asides and the capital assets tax, have been paid.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=49}}

Because of the way workplaces and the investment mechanism are structured, Schweickart's model aims to facilitate [[fair trade]], not [[free trade]], between nations. Under Economic Democracy, there would be virtually no cross-border capital flows. Enterprises themselves would not relocate abroad, since they are democratically controlled by their own workers. [[Financial capital|Finance capital]] stays mostly at home, since funds for investment are publicly generated and are mandated by law to be reinvested domestically. "Capital doesn't flow into the country, either, since there are no [[stock]]s nor [[Bond (finance)|corporate bonds]] nor businesses to buy. The capital assets of the country are collectively owned – and hence not for sale."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=63}}

According to Michael Howard, "in preserving commodity exchange, a [[market socialism]] has greater continuity with the society it displaces than does nonmarket socialism, and thus it is more likely to emerge from capitalism as a result of tendencies generated within it." But Howard also suggested, "one argument against the market in socialist society has been that it blocks progress toward full communism or even leads back to capitalism".&lt;ref name="Rose In The Fist"&gt;{{cite book |last=Howard |first=Michael |title=Self-Management and the Crisis of Socialism: The Rose in the Fist of the Present |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. |isbn=0-8476-8905-0 |year=2000 |page=76 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, nonmarket models of economic democracy have also been proposed.

=== Economic democracy as part of an inclusive democracy ===
{{Main|Inclusive democracy}}
Economic democracy is described as an integral component of an [[inclusive democracy]] in Takis Fotopoulos' ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy'' as a stateless, moneyless and marketless economy that precludes private accumulation of wealth and the institutionalization of privileges for some sections of society, without relying on a mythical post-scarcity state of abundance, or sacrificing freedom of choice.

The proposed system aims to meet the basic needs of all citizens ([[macroeconomic]] decisions), and secure freedom of choice ([[microeconomic]] decisions). Therefore, the system consists of two basic elements: (1) democratic planning, which involves a feedback process between workplace assemblies, demotic assemblies and a confederal assembly, and (2) an artificial market using [[Labour voucher|personal vouchers]], which ensures [[choice|freedom of choice]] but avoids the adverse effects of real markets. Although David Pepper called this system "a form of money based on the labour theory of value",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pepper | first = David | title = Modern environmentalism: An Introduction | publisher = Routledge | location = London; New York | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-415-05745-5 | page = 321}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is not a money model since vouchers cannot be used as a general medium of exchange and store of wealth.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Another distinguishing feature of inclusive democracy is its distinction between basic and non-basic needs. Remuneration is determined separately according to the cost of basic needs, and according to degree of effort for non-basic needs. Inclusive democracy is based on the principle that meeting basic needs is a fundamental human right which is guaranteed to all who are in a physical condition to offer a minimal amount of work. By contrast, [[participatory economics]] guarantees that basic needs are satisfied only for public goods or are covered by compassion and by a guaranteed basic income for the unemployed and those who cannot work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Albert  | first = Michael |title = Parecon: Life After Capitalism | publisher = Verso Books | location = New York | year = 2003 | pages = 37–38 | isbn = 978-1-85984-698-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many advocates of participatory economics and [[Participism]] have contested this.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

As part of inclusive democracy, economic democracy is the authority of demos (community) in the economic sphere—which requires equal distribution of economic power. Therefore, all macroeconomic decisions (overall level of production, consumption and investment, amounts of work and leisure implied, technologies to be used and so on) are made collectively and without representation. However, microeconomic decisions are made by the individual production or consumption unit through a proposed system of vouchers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

As with the case of direct democracy, economic democracy is only feasible if the participants can easily cooperate.

== Reform agendas ==
While [[Reform movement|reform agendas]] tend to critique the existing system and recommend corrective measures, they do not necessarily suggest alternative models to replace the fundamental structures of capitalism; private ownership of productive resources, the market and wage labor.

=== Social credit ===
{{Main|Social credit}}
Rather than an economic shortfall, many analysts{{who|date=January 2012}} consider the gap between production and purchasing power a social dividend. In this view, credit is a [[public utility]] rather than debt to financial centers. Once reinvested in human productive potential, the [[Economic surplus|surplus]] of societal output could actually increase Gross Domestic Product rather than throttling it, resulting in a more efficient economy, overall.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} [[Social Credit]] is an economic reform movement that originates from theories developed by Scottish engineer Major [[C. H. Douglas]]. His aim to make societal improvement the goal of economic systems is reflected in the term "Social Credit", and published in his book, entitled ''Economic Democracy''. In this view, the term "economic democracy" does not mean worker control of industry.&lt;ref name="Douglas CP&amp;D"&gt;{{cite book |title=Credit-Power and Democracy |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |year=1933 |publisher=The Social Credit Press |location=Melbourne, Australia |pages=4–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While technological advancement tends to increase unemployment along with productivity, Douglas suggests that our perspective will determine whether this problem is a "catastrophe" or a "magnificent achievement":

{{quote|The so-called unemployment problem is really a problem of leisure. The problem really is a problem, first of the distribution of purchasing power to those who are not required, and will decreasingly be required, in the industrial system, and secondly, of ensuring that the total purchasing distributed shall always be enough to pay for the goods and services for sale.{{sfn|Cook, "C.H. Douglas"|2007}}|sign=|source=}}

A national dividend and a compensated price mechanism are the two most essential components of the Social Credit program. While these measures have never been implemented in their purest form, they have provided a foundation for Social Credit political parties in many countries and for reform agendas that retain the title, "economic democracy".

==== Credit as a public utility ====
Following Douglas and a reform program based on direct government spending set forth by groups such as the [[American Monetary Institute]], veteran Project Manager for the [[U.S. Treasury Department]], [[Richard C. Cook]] proposes two general measures, which together he terms, "economic democracy":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cook| first=Richard C.| year=07/02/2010 | title=Monetary Reform and How a National Monetary System Should Work| publisher=Global Research| url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=5615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Credit as a public utility: "We should spend sufficient credit into existence to supply the basic operating expenses of government at all levels without recourse to either taxes or borrowing. At least ninety percent of all taxes could be eliminated. The only taxes that should be retained would be those in the form of user fees for infrastructure operations and maintenance and those levied only for dire emergencies. Capital expenses for infrastructure construction at the federal, state, and local levels should be financed through a self-capitalized national infrastructure bank lending at zero-interest. Operating on a national scale, such a bank could begin to rebuild our job base starting at the state and local levels. A public program of direct government expenditures as described herein would be as effective, as timely, far less inflationary, and much cheaper than creating new public debt by borrowing credit created 'out of thin air' by the banking system".{{sfn|Cook|2008|pp=128–129}}

[[File:GAP Chart from We Hold These Truths.jpg|thumb|320px|GAP Chart from [[We Hold These Truths: The Hope of Monetary Reform|''We Hold These Truths'']]]]

* A national dividend: "The endemic gap between prices and purchasing power in an advanced economic system in reality is the “leisure dividend” that we never received from our amazing producing economy. That gap should now be filled by a non-taxable national dividend of two types. One would be a cash stipend paid to all citizens which would also serve the purpose of eliminating poverty by providing everyone with a basic income guarantee. The remainder of the national dividend would consist of an overall pricing subsidy, whereby a designated proportion of all purchases, including home building expenses, would be rebated to consumers. The average national dividend per person would probably exceed $12,000 per year under today's economic conditions. It would be a calculated value charged against a government ledger but would be off-budget, with no need to finance it with taxation or borrowing".{{sfn|Cook|2008|pp=128–129}}

While Smith and others suggest an [[Crisis (economic)|economic crisis]] might be necessary to drive a movement toward large-scale economic democracy,{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} {{sfn|Barnes|2006|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} Cook argues that "most economic reform programs address symptoms, not causes":{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}}

{{quote|[[Monetary reform]] embraces the enormous productivity of modern industrial methods with approval and hope. But it identifies factors in the nature of industrial production at the level of the corporation as creating a chronic state of instability.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} The top priority of the reform program would be to use public credit to rebuild the producing economy which has been wrecked by the phony ideology of 'market' economics and the inept and self-serving manipulation of the money supply by the Federal Reserve and the banks.{{sfn|Cook, "Credit as a Public Utility" Part 2|2007}}|sign=|source=}}

Cook avoided [[Collectivism|collectivist]] solutions. Rather, he affirmed the value of "democratic capitalism," combined with a shift to more public control of credit, and suggested a new approach to achieving worldwide prosperity, starting with economic recovery in the United States. Cook's argument stemmed from prior success in the United States treating credit as a public utility, including [[Early American currency|colonial paper currencies]] which allowed an emerging American society to monetize the value of its goods and services, the [[Greenback (money)|Greenbacks]] issued by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[American civil war]], and the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC) which moved to recapitalize failing state banks in rural areas and small towns during the [[Great Depression]]. While President [[Herbert Hoover]]'s efforts failed, Cook credits RFC programs with providing low interest loans to the railroad industry, farmers, exporters, state and local governments, and wartime industries over a period of at least 20 years.{{sfn|Cook|2008|pp=81–112}}

==== National dividend ====
Cook also proposed a national dividend, sometimes known as a [[Basic income|Basic Income Guarantee]] or "BIG", was advocated in the United States by economists, politicians and reformers, including [[Thomas Paine]], [[Milton Friedman]], Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[John Kenneth Galbraith]]. Friedman originally proposed a [[negative income tax]] to support this system, but then opposed the bill because its revised implementation would have merely supplemented rather than replacing existing tax-structures. Cook suggested that racism might have been at the root of BIG's demise in the late 1960s, as "many beneficiaries of the program would have been African-American".{{sfn|Cook|2008|p=121}} In 2006, Representative [[Bob Filner]] (D-CA) proposed a modest basic income guarantee via an inflation-adjusted refundable tax credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/5257 |title=H.R.5257 - Tax Cut for the Rest of Us Act of 2006, 109th Congress (2005-2006)|date=2 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the U.S. Basic Income Guarantee Network:

{{quote|The basic income guarantee (BIG) is a government insured guarantee that no citizen's income will fall below some minimal level for any reason. All citizens would receive a BIG without means test or work requirement. BIG is an efficient and effective solution to poverty that preserves individual autonomy and work incentives while simplifying government social policy. Some researchers estimate that a small BIG, sufficient to cut the poverty rate in half could be financed without an increase in taxes by redirecting funds from spending programs and tax deductions aimed at maintaining incomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=June 1, 2007|url=http://www.usbig.net/ |title=The U.S. Basic Income Guarantee Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Cook suggests existing U.S. (GDP) could support such a system. GDP of $12.98-trillion minus $9.21-trillion in purchasing power ("wages") equals a difference of $3.77-trillion. Distributed equally amongst United States citizens, Cook estimates a "National Dividend" of approximately $12,600 could be provided annually to every U.S. citizen. A primary function of monetary reform is to "provide sufficient individual income"—not merely "create jobs"—for American workers displaced by technological advancement, outsourcing, and other economic influences beyond their control. Funding of the National Dividend would be drawn from a national credit account, which would include all factors that generate production costs and create new capital assets. The national credit account could also be used for price subsidies to discourage manufacturers from cutting costs by shipping jobs overseas. 
Rather than [[Federal Reserve Note]]s, circulated only through debt payable to a bank with interest, the National Dividend would be "real money", based on the productive capacity of the economy expressed as GDP. Cook says, "it's important to realize that [[Social Credit]] is not a socialist system. Rather it is 'democratic capitalism,' in contrast to the 'finance capitalism' that has become so damaging".{{sfn|Cook, "US Economy on Life Support"|2007}} Rooted in the ideals of Social Credit, proposed by Douglas in the 1920s, Cook explains:

{{quote|The difference between a National Dividend and a basic income guarantee is that the dividend is tied to production and consumption data and may vary from year to year. During years that the dividend falls below a designated threshold, the balance of a basic income guarantee could be provided from tax revenues. But in a highly automated economy such as that of the U.S., the National Dividend would normally be sufficient.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 2|2007}}|sign=|source=}}

In his book, ''Capitalism 3.0'', Peter Barnes likens a "National Dividend" to the game of [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]], where all players start with a fair distribution of financial opportunity to succeed, and try to privatize as much as they can as they move around "the commons". Distinguishing the board game from real-world business, Barnes claims that "the top 5 percent of the population owns more [[property]] than the remaining 95 percent", providing the smaller minority with an unfair advantage of approximately "$5-trillion" annually, at the beginning of the game. Contrasting "redistribution" of income (or property) with "predistribution", Barnes argues for "propertizing" (without corporately privatizing) "the commons" to spread ownership universally, without taking wealth from some and giving it to others. His suggested mechanism to this end is the establishment of a "Commons Sector", ensuring payment from the Corporate Sector for "the commons" they utilize, and equitably distributing the proceeds for the benefit of contemporary and future generations of society.

One real-world example of such reform is in the U.S. State of [[Alaska]], where each citizen receives an annual share of the part of the state's oil revenues via the "[[Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend]]". Barnes suggests this model could extend to other states and nations because "we jointly own many valuable assets". As corporate pollution of common assets increased, the permits for such pollution would become more scarce, driving prices for those permits up. "Less pollution would equal more revenue", and over time, "trillions of dollars could flow into an American Permanent Fund".{{sfn|Barnes|2006|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

However, none of these proposals aspire to the mandates recommended by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.:

{{quote|Two conditions are indispensable if we are to ensure that the guaranteed income operates as a consistently progressive measure. First, it must be pegged to the median income of society, not the lowest levels of income. To guarantee an income at the floor would simply perpetuate welfare standards and freeze into the society poverty conditions. Second, the guaranteed income must be dynamic; it must automatically increase as the total social income grows. Were it permitted to remain static under growth conditions, the recipients would suffer a relative decline. If periodic reviews disclose that the whole national income has risen, then the guaranteed income would have to be adjusted upward by the same percentage. Without these safeguards a creeping retrogression would occur, nullifying the gains of security and stability.{{sfn|King|1968|p=164}}}}

Barnes deemed any such reform unlikely. Thomas Paine originally recommended a National Dividend to compensate for the brutality of British Enclosures, but his idea was never adopted.{{sfn|Barnes|2006|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

=== Monopoly power versus public utility ===
{{Main|J. W. Smith}}

Rather than superficially compensating for legalized inequities, Smith recommends abolishing or redefining property rights laws with particular respect for "the commons".{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} According to Smith [[entitlement|exclusive title]] to natural resources and technologies should be converted to inclusive conditional titles—the condition being that society should collect rental values on all natural resources.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=2}} Smith suggests the basic principles of monopolization under feudalism were never abandoned, and residues of exclusive feudal property rights restrict the potential efficiency of capitalism in [[Western culture]]s.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} He estimated that roughly 60 percent of American capital is little more than capitalized values of unearned wealth. He proposed that elimination of these monopoly values would double [[economic efficiency]], maintain [[quality of life]], and reduce [[Working time|working hours]] by half. Wasteful monetary flows could be stopped only by eliminating all methods of monopolization typical in Western economies.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xiv}}

Smith divided "primary (feudal) monopoly" into four general categories: banking; land; technology and [[Telecommunication|communications]]. He listed three general categories of "secondary (modern) monopoly"; insurance, law, health care.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=14}} Smith further claimed that converting these exclusive entitlements to inclusive human rights would minimize battles for [[market share]], thereby eliminating most offices and staff needed to maintain monopoly structures, and stop the wars generated to protect them. Dissolving roughly half the economic activity of a monopoly system would reduce the costs of common resources by roughly half, and significantly minimize the most influential factors of poverty.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

In Smith's view, most taxes should be eliminated, and productive enterprise should be privately owned and managed.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=2, 187}} Inventors should be paid well and all technology placed in the public domain. Crucial services currently monopolized through [[License|licensing]] should be legislated as human rights.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=2, 13, 22, 90, 102, 113, 124, 220}}

Smith envisioned a balanced economy under a socially owned banking commons within an inclusive society with full and [[Social equality|equal rights]] for all.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=3}} Federated regions collect [[resource rent]]s on land and technology to a [[social fund]] to operate governments and care for social needs.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=17, 54}} Socially owned banks provide finance capital by creating debt-free money for social infrastructure and industry.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xv}} Rental values return to society through expenditure on public infrastructures. Local labor is trained and employed to build and maintain water systems, sewers, roads, communication systems, railroads, ports, airports, post offices, and education systems.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=2, 84}} Purchasing power circulates regionally, as labor spends wages in consumption and governments spend resource rent and banking profits to maintain essential services.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=16–17}}

According to Smith, all monetary systems, including [[money market]]s, should function within [[fractional-reserve banking]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=15}} Financial capital should be the total savings of all citizens, balanced by primary-created money to fill any shortfall, or its destruction through increased reserve requirements to eliminate any surplus.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=16}} Adjustments of required reserves should facilitate the balance between building with socially created money or savings. Any shortage of savings within a socially owned banking system should be alleviated by simply printing it.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=13}}

=== Cooperatives ===
{{Main|Cooperative}}
A [[cooperative]] is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise. By various names, cooperatives play an essential role in all forms of Economic Democracy. Classified as either [[consumer cooperative]]s or [[worker cooperative]]s, the cooperative business model is fundamental to the interests of economic democracy.

According to the [[International Cooperative Alliance]]'s [[Statement on the Cooperative Identity]], "cooperatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting policies and making decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary cooperatives members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) and cooperatives at other levels are also organized in a democratic manner."

==== Worker cooperatives ====
{{Main|Worker cooperative}}
According to the [[United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives]]: "Worker cooperatives are business entities that are owned and controlled by their members, the people who work in them. The two central characteristics of worker cooperatives are: 1) workers invest in and own the business and (2) decision-making is democratic, generally adhering to the principle of one worker-one vote." Worker cooperatives occupy multiple sectors and industries in the United States, mostly in the Northeast, the West Coast and the Upper Midwest, totaling 300 democratic workplaces in the United States, employing over 3,500 people and generating over $400 million in annual revenues. While a few are larger enterprises, most are small. Growing steadily between 1990 and 2010, technology and home health care experienced most of the recent increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=US Federation of Worker Cooperatives|title=About Worker Cooperatives|url=http://usworker.coop/aboutworkercoops|publisher=US Federation of Worker Cooperatives|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worker cooperatives generally employ an industrial model called [[workplace democracy]], which rejects the "master-servant relationship" implicit in the traditional employment contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellerman|first=David P.|title=The Democratic Worker-Owned Firm: A New Model for the East and West|publisher=Unwin Hyman Limited (HarperCollins Academic)|location=London|isbn=0-04-445743-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wilkinson and Pickett, neither ownership or participation alone are sufficient to establish democracy in the workplace. "[M]any share-ownership schemes amount to little more than incentive schemes, intended to make employees more compliant with management and sometimes to provide a nest-egg for retirement... To make a reliable difference to company performance, share-ownership has to be combined with more participative management methods." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|first=Richard|title=The Spirit Level|year=2009|publisher=Bloomsbury Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60819-036-2|pages=248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahl further argued that self-governing enterprises should not be confused with other systems they might resemble:

{{quote|Self-governing enterprises only remotely resemble pseudodemocratic schemes of employee consultation by management; schemes of limited employee participation that leave all critical decisions with a management elected by stockholders; or Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) that are created only or primarily to provide corporations with low-interest loans, lower corporate income taxes, greater cash flow, employee pension plans, or a market for their stock, without, however, any significant changes in control.{{sfn|Dahl|1985|pp=92–93 }}|sign=|source=}}

In worker cooperatives, [[net income]] is called [[Economic surplus|surplus]] instead of [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] and is distributed among the members based on hours worked, seniority, or other criteria. In a worker cooperative, workers own their jobs, and therefore have a direct stake in the local environment and the power to conduct business in ways that benefit the community rather than destroying it. Some worker cooperatives maintain what is known as a “multiple bottom line”, evaluating success not merely in terms of net income, but also by factors like their sustainability as a business, their contribution to the community, and the happiness and longevity of their workers.&lt;ref name="usworker" /&gt;

Worker-control can take many forms depending on the size and type of the business. Approaches to decision-making include: an elected board of directors, elected managers, management job roles, no management at all, consensus, majority vote, or combinations of the above.&lt;ref name="usworker" /&gt; Participation in decision-making becomes the responsibility and privilege of each member.{{sfn|DeNies|2003}} In one variation, workers usually invest money when they begin working.&lt;ref name="usworker"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.usworker.coop/front |title=US Federation of Worker Cooperatives |work=usworker.coop |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each member owns one share, which provides its owner with one vote in company decision-making. While membership is not a requirement of employment, only employees can become members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.canadianworker.coop/worker-co-op |title=What is a Worker Co-op? | publisher = Canadian Worker Co-op Federation |work=canadianworker.coop |year=2012 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kenneth W. Stikkers, the [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon cooperatives]] in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque region]] of [[Spain]] have achieved a previously unknown level of economic democracy. Established in 1956, Mondragon has since become an economic model that transcends the capitalist-socialist dichotomy and thereby helps us to imagine creative solutions to current economic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stikkers|first=Kenneth W.|title=Dewey and the Mondragon Cooperatives|journal=European Journal of Pragmatism and American Philosophy|year=2011|volume=3|series=2036-4091|issue=2|pages=195–197|url=http://lnx.journalofpragmatism.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/stikkers.pdf|accessdate=10/02/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[Richard D. Wolff]] argues that Mondragon is an example of "a stunningly successful alternative to the capitalist organization of production."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard D. Wolff]] (June 24, 2012). [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/24/alternative-capitalism-mondragon "Yes, there is an alternative to capitalism: Mondragon shows the way."] ''[[The Guardian]].'' Retrieved 27 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Consumer cooperatives ====
{{Main|Consumer cooperative}}
A [[consumers' cooperative]] is owned by its customers for their [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual benefit]]. Oriented towards service rather than profit, consumers often provide capital to launch or purchase the enterprise. In practice, consumer cooperatives price goods and services at competitive market rates. The co-op returns profits to the consumer/owner according to a formula instead of paying a separate investor group.

In his book, ''From Mondragon To America'', Greg MacLeod argues that "in consumer cooperatives where the customer-members own the capital and the employees are subject to capital, the normal dynamic is the adversarial relationship of labor to capital. Sometimes the result is strikes of labor against management." In some cooperatives, however, consumer/owners are workers as well. For example, Mondragon has developed a large "hybrid" cooperative which sells groceries and furniture in Spain.

Consumer cooperatives vary in organization and operations, but typically follow the [[Rochdale Principles]]. Consumer cooperatives may also form [[Co-operative Federation]]s. These may take the form of [[Co-operative Wholesale Society|co-operative wholesale societies]], through which they collectively purchase goods at [[wholesale]] prices and, in some cases, cooperatively own factories. Alternatively, they may be members of [[Co-operative union]]s.

Consumer cooperatives are very different from "discount clubs," which charge annual fees in exchange for a discount on purchases. The club is not owned or governed by the members and profits go to investors, not to members.&lt;ref name="CooperativeGrocer"&gt;[http://www.cooperativegrocer.coop/cg_coops.html What is a Consumer Cooperative? – Cooperative Grocer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217055607/http://www.cooperativegrocer.coop/cg_coops.html |date=December 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Food cooperatives =====
{{Main|Food cooperative}}Most food co-ops are consumer cooperatives that specialize in grocery products. Members patronize the store and vote in elections. The members elect a board of directors to make high-level decisions and recruit managers.&lt;ref name="CooperativeGrocer" /&gt; [[Food cooperatives]] were originally established to provide fresh, [[Organic food|organic produce]] as a viable alternative to packaged imports. The ideas of local and [[slow food]] production can help local farmers prosper, in addition to providing consumers with fresher products. But the growing ubiquity of organic food products in corporate stores testifies to broadening consumer awareness, and to the dynamics of global marketing.{{sfn|DeNies|2003}}

For example, associated with national and international cooperative communities, Portland Oregon cooperatives manage to survive market competition with corporate franchise. As Lee Lancaster, financial manager for Food Front, states, "cooperatives are potentially one democratic economic model that could help guide business decisions toward meeting human needs while honoring the needs of society and nature". He admits, however, it is difficult to maintain collaboration among cooperatives while also avoiding integration that typically results in centralized authority.{{sfn|DeNies|2003}}

=== Regional trading currencies ===
According to [[Thomas H. Greco, Jr.]], author of New Money for Healthy Communities "The pinnacle of power in today's world is the power to issue money. If that power can be democratized and focused in a direction which gives social and ecological concerns top priority, then there may yet be hope for saving the world". In this regard, he recommended the regionalization of currencies. Cook suggested that "under the [[Bretton Woods system]], the Federal Reserve acted as the world's central bank. This gave America enormous leverage over economic policies of its principal trading partners".{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} Cook claimed that developing nations were susceptible to exploitation mainly because they have no independent monetary system, using the U.S. dollar instead. This fed the fractional reserve banking system, operated by the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Japan. Developing nations paid heavily for this service through market interest rates and because banking profits and property ownership emigrate to financial centers elsewhere.{{sfn|Cook, "US Immigration Crisis"|2007}}

According to Smith, "Currency is only the representation of wealth produced by combining land (resources), labor, and industrial capital". He claimed that no country was free when another country has such leverage over its entire economy. But by combining their resources, Smith claimed that developing nations have all three of these foundations of wealth:

{{quote|By peripheral nations using the currency of an imperial center as its trading currency, the imperial center can actually print money to own industry within those periphery countries. By forming regional trading blocs and printing their own trading currency, the developing world has all four requirements for production, resources, labor, industrial capital, and finance capital. The wealth produced provides the value to back the created and circulating money.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Smith further explained that developed countries need resources from the developing world as much as developing countries need finance capital and technology from the developed world. Aside from the superior military power of the imperial centers, the undeveloped world actually has superior bargaining leverage. With independent trading currencies, developing countries could barter their resources to the developed world for the latest industrial technologies. Barter avoids "hard money monopolization"{{clarify|date=January 2012}} and the unequal trade between weak and strong nations that result. Smith suggested that barter was how Germany resolved many financial difficulties "put in place to strangle her", and that "World Wars I and II settled that trade dispute". He claimed that their intentions of exclusive entitlement were clearly exposed when the imperial centers resorted to military force to prevent such barter and maintain monopoly control of others' resources.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

=== Democratizing workplaces and distributing productive assets ===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

==== The Workplace as a political entity to be democratized ====
Workplace democracy has been cited as a possible solution to the problems that arise from excluding employees from decision-making such as low-employee morale, employee alienation, and low employee engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=122513|title=An Alternative Organizational Model: Workplace Democracy|last=van der Vliet|first=Merijn|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political theorist Isabelle Ferreras argues that there exists “a great contradiction between the democratic nature of our times and the reality of the work experience.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Firms as Political Entities: Saving Democracy through Economic Bicameralism|last=Ferreras|first=Isabelle|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=9781108245043|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that the modern corporation's two basic inputs, capital and labor, are treated in radically different ways. Capital owners of a firm wield power within a system of shareholder democracy that allocates voice democratically according to how much capital investment they place in the firm. Labor, on the other hand, rarely benefits from a system to voice their concerns within the firm. She argues that firms are more than just economic organizations especially given the power that they wield over people's livelihoods, environment, and rights. Rather, Ferreras holds that firms are best understood as political entities. And as political entities “it is crucial that firms be made compatible with the democratic commitments of our nations.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Germany and to a lesser extent the broader European Union have experimented with a way of workplace democracy known as Co-determination, a system that allows workers to elect representatives that sit on the board of directors of a company. Common criticisms of workplace democracy include that democratic workplaces are less efficient than hierarchical workplace, that managers are best equipped to make company decisions since they are better educated and aware of the broader business context.

==== Creating a widespread distribution of productive assets ====
One of the biggest criticisms against capitalism is that it concentrates economic and, as a result, political power in few hands. Theorists of economic democracy have argued that one solution to this unequal concentration of power is to create mechanism that distribute ownership of productive assets across the entire population. In ''Justice as Fairness: A Restatement'', John Rawls argues that only two systems could embody the main features of his principles of justice: liberal socialism or a property-owning democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45388455|title=Justice as fairness : a restatement|last=1921-2002.|first=Rawls, John,|date=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|others=Kelly, Erin.|isbn=0674005104|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=45388455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within property-owning democracy Rawls envisions widespread use of worker-owned cooperatives, partial-employee ownership of firms, systems to redistribute one's asset after death to prevent the accumulation of wealth, as well as a strong system of asset-based redistribution that encourages workers to own productive assets.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Samuel. "'Rawls and Property-Owning Democracy'." In Unpacking Rawls, edited by Nicola Riva., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating under the idea that making ownership more widespread leads to more equitable outcomes various proposals of asset-based welfare and asset-redistribution have been conceived. Individualistic and liberal asset-based welfare strategies such as the United Kingdom's Child Trust Fund of the United States Individual Development Account aimed to help people save money so that it could be invested on education, home-ownership, or entrepreneurship. More expirmental and left-leaning proposals include worker owned cooperatives, ESOPS, or Roemers coupon socialism.

== Critiques ==
[[Ludwig von Mises]] argued that ownership and control over the [[means of production]] belongs to private firms and can only be sustained by means of consumer choice, exercised daily in the marketplace.{{sfn|Mises|1953|loc=preface; p. 443}} "The capitalistic social order", he claimed, therefore "is an economic democracy in the strictest sense of the word".{{sfn|Mises|2006|p=158}} Critics of this claim point out that consumers only vote on the value of the product when they make a purchase—they are not participating in the management of firms, or voting on how the profits are to be used.

{{Buddhism|terse=1}}
'''Ekaggatā''' (Pali; Sanskrit ''[[Ekagrata|ekāgratā]]'', एकाग्रता) is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as "unification of awareness" or "one-pointedness." It is a [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factor]] that has the function to focus on an object.{{source?|date=November 2018}}

''Ekaggatā'' is identified within the Buddhist teachings as:
* One of the [[Mental_factors_(Buddhism)#Seven_universal_mental_factors|seven universal mental factors]] within the Theravada abhidharma teachings. 
* One of the qualities associated with the second [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]], according to the Pali Canon.&lt;ref&gt;Henepola Gunaratana, ''The Path of Serenity and Insight: An Explanation of the Buddhist Jhānas'', p.87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roderick S. Bucknell (1993), ''Reinterpreting the Jhanas''. p.375&lt;/ref&gt;
* A factor that counteracts the hindrance of sensory desire ([[kāmacchanda]]) within the [[five hindrances]].

==Definition==
Bhikkhu Bodhi states:
:This is the unification of the mind on its object. Although this factor comes to prominence in the jhānas, where it functions as a jhāna factor, the Abhidhamma teaches that the germ of that capacity for mental unification is present in all types of consciousness, even the most rudimentary. It there functions as the factor which fixes the mind on its object. One-pointedness has non-wandering or non-distraction as its characteristic. Its function is to conglomerate or unite the associated states.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2217-2221}}

Bhikkhu Bodhi also explains that at the level of profound concentration (i.e. in the jhanas), it manifests as peace, and its proximate cause is happiness.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2217-2221}} 

Nina van Gorkom explains:
:Ekaggatā is the cetasika which has as function to focus on that one object. Seeing-consciousness, for example, can only know visible object, it cannot know any other object and ekaggatā focuses on visible object. Hearing-consciousness can only know sound, it cannot know visible object or any other object and ekaggatā focuses on sound.

The [[Atthasālinī]] (1, Part IV, Chapter 1. 118, 119) states about ekaggatā (in the context of sammā-samādhi):
: This concentration, known as one-pointedness of mind, has non-scattering (of itself) or non-distraction (of associated states) as characteristic, the welding together of the coexistent states as function, as water kneads bath-powder into a paste, and peace of mind or knowledge as manifestation. For it has been said: 'He who is concentrated knows, sees according to the truth.' It is distinguished by having ease (sukha) (usually) as a proximate cause. Like the steadiness of a lamp in the absence of wind, so should steadfastness of mind be understood.&lt;ref name=gorkom1&gt;Gorkom (2010), [http://www.zolag.co.uk/Cetasikas/html_node/Concentration.html#Concentration Definition of ekaggata]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ajahn Sucitto explains:
: This is the factor of absorption that arises dependent on bringing to mind, non-involvement and evaluation. It occurs in meditation when the quality of ease has calmed rapture and the mental energy; the energy of focusing and the bodily energy are in harmony. The resultant merging of mind and body is experienced as a firmness in awareness, which is hence not penetrated by sense-impressions.&lt;ref&gt;Ajahn Sucitto (2011). ''Meditation, A Way of Awakening''. Amaravati Publications. p. 267. (from the glossary)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Totalitarian principle==
{{main article|Totalitarian principle}}
In ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', author [[T. H. White]] proposed the opposite as the rule of [[totalitarianism]]: "Everything which is not forbidden is compulsory."&lt;ref&gt;	T. H. White, ''[[The Sword in the Stone (novel)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' (book 1 of ''The Once and Future King''), Collins (1938)&lt;/ref&gt; This quote has been suggested as a [[Totalitarian principle|principle of physics]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Weinberg, "Einstein's Mistakes," in Donald Goldsmith and Marcia Bartusiak (eds.), ''E: His Life, His Thought and His Influence on Our Culture,'' Sterling Publishing (2006) p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National traditions==
The claim that “everything which is not fobidden is allowed” is a principle only of English law does not stand the test of reality. In fact, it is a common principle of liberal democracies. In Germany, it has constitutional rank under Art. 2(1) of the GG which protects the general freedom to act (Allgemeine Handlungsfreiheit), as demonstrated e.g. by the judgment of the Bundesverfassungsgericht known as “Reiten im Walde” (BVerfGE 80, 137).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10057">'''Evolutionism''' describes the belief in the [[evolution]] of [[Organism|organisms]]. Its exact meaning has changed over time as the study of evolution has progressed. In the 19th-century, it was used to describe the belief that organisms deliberately improved themselves through progressive inherited change ([[orthogenesis]]).&lt;ref name="isbn0-550-11000-3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Carneiro | first=Robert, L. | title=Evolutionism in cultural anthropology : a critical history | publisher=Westview Press | location=Cambridge, MA | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-8133-3766-1 | pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[teleological]] belief went on to include [[cultural evolution]] and [[social evolution]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-550-11000-3"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Allen, R.

The belief was also extended to cultures and societies, and to living organisms. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s the term Neo-Evolutionism was used to describe the idea "that human beings sought to preserve a familiar style of life unless change was forced on them by factors that were beyond their control".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Trigger|Trigger, Bruce]]  (1986) ''A History of Archeological Thought'' Cambridge University Press pg 290&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also sometimes used by the [[Creationism|creationist movement]] to describe adherence to the scientific consensus on evolution as equivalent to a [[secular religion]].&lt;ref name="ICRMuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/icr-visit/linke.html|title=A Visit to the ICR Museum|author=Linke, Steven|date=August 28, 1992|publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]]|accessdate=2008-12-05|quote=In fact, true science supports the Biblical worldview...

They object that too often evolution operates as a kind of secular religion, pushing norms and proposals for proper (or, in their opinion, improper) action.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is very seldom used within the scientific community, since the scientific position on evolution is accepted by the overwhelming majority of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;"Nearly all scientists (97%) say humans and other living things have evolved over time", [http://people-press.org/reports/pdf/528.pdf Public Praises Science; Scientists Fault Public, Media] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091108193045/http://people-press.org/reports/pdf/528.pdf |date=2009-11-08 }}, [[Pew Research Center]], 9 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Because evolutionary biology is the default scientific position, it is assumed that "scientists" or "biologists" are "evolutionists" unless specifically noted otherwise.&lt;ref name="Dichotomy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/cej/4/2/supposed-dichotomy-between-creationism-evolution |title=The Supposed Dichotomy between Creationism and Evolution |author= Gough, J. B. |year=1983 |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |accessdate=2009-09-24}} "...to say a person is a scientist encompasses the fact that he or she is an evolutionist."&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[creation-evolution controversy|creation{{endash}}evolution controversy]], creationists often call those who accept the validity of the modern evolutionary synthesis "evolutionists" and the theory itself "evolutionism".

Before its use to describe biological evolution, the term "evolution" was originally used to refer to any orderly sequence of events with the outcome somehow contained at the start.&lt;ref name=Carneiro&gt;Carneiro, Robert L.(Léonard) (2003) ''Evolutionism in cultural anthropology: a critical history'' Westview Press pg 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; The first five editions of Darwin's in ''Origin of Species'' used the word "evolved", but the word "evolution" was only used in its sixth edition in 1872.&lt;ref name="penguin origin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Darwin|first=Charles|title=The Origin of Species|year=1986|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England|isbn=0-14-043205-1|edition=reprint of 1st|editor=Burrow, JW|page=460|quote=...from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, ''evolved'' (italics not in original)}}&lt;/ref&gt; By then, [[Herbert Spencer]] had developed the concept theory that organisms strive to evolve due to an internal "driving force" ([[orthogenesis]]) in 1862.&lt;ref name=Carneiro/&gt;  Edward B. Tylor and Lewis H Morgan brought the term "evolution" to anthropology though they tended toward the older pre-Spencerian definition helping to form the concept of [[unilineal evolution|unilineal (social) evolution]] used during the later part of what Trigger calls the Antiquarianism-Imperial Synthesis period (c1770-c1900).&lt;ref&gt;Trigger, Bruce (1986) ''A History of Archaeological Thought'' Cambridge University Press pg 102&lt;/ref&gt; The term evolutionism subsequently came to be used for the now discredited theory that evolution contained a deliberate component, rather than the selection of [[Beneficial mutation|beneficial traits]] from [[Genetic variation|random variation]] by [[Survival of the fittest|differential survival]].

==Modern use by creationists==
In modern times, the term ''[[evolution]]'' is widely used, but the terms ''evolutionism'' and ''evolutionist'' are seldom used in the [[scientific community]] to refer to [[evolutionary biology]], since the term is considered both redundant and anachronistic. 

However, the term has been used by creationists in discussing the [[creation-evolution controversy]].&lt;ref name="Dichotomy" /&gt; For example, the [[Institute for Creation Research]], in order to imply placement of evolution in the category of 'religions', including [[atheism]], [[fascism]], [[humanism]] and [[occultism]], commonly uses the words ''evolutionism'' and ''evolutionist'' to describe the consensus of mainstream science and the scientists subscribing to it, thus implying through language that the issue is a matter of religious belief.&lt;ref name=ICRMuseum/&gt; The [[BioLogos Foundation]], an organization that promotes the idea of [[theistic evolution]], uses the term "evolutionism" to describe "the atheistic worldview that so often accompanies the acceptance of biological evolution in public discourse." It views this as a subset of [[scientism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biologos.org/questions/biologos-id-creationism|title=How is BioLogos different from Evolutionism, Intelligent Design, and Creationism|publisher=The BioLogos Foundation|quote= While BioLogos accepts evolution, it emphatically rejects evolutionism, the atheistic worldview that so often accompanies the acceptance of biological evolution in public discourse. Proponents of evolutionism believe every aspect of life will one day be explained with evolutionary theory. In this way it is a subset of scientism, the broader view that the only real truth is that which can be discovered by science. These positions are commonly held by materialists (also called philosophical naturalists) who deny the existence of the supernatural.|accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7314">A '''false dilemma''' is a type of [[informal fallacy]] in which something is falsely claimed to be an [[Exclusive_or#Exclusive_"or"_in_English|"either/or"]] situation, when in fact there is at least one additional option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/resources/fallacy-definitions/False-Dilemma.html |title=False Dilemma |publisher= Department of Philosophy, [[Texas State University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A false [[dilemma]] can arise intentionally, when a fallacy is used in an attempt to force a choice or outcome. The opposite of this fallacy is [[false compromise]]. For example, what is described as the "TINA factor" in elections is often in reality a false dilemma, as there are about 3 to 25 electoral candidates for most electoral seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rajiv's TINA factor |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/19880229-there-is-no-alternative-to-prime-minister-rajiv-gandhi-and-the-congressi-poll-796992-1988-02-29 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |publisher=India Today |date=29 February 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The false dilemma fallacy can also arise simply by accidental omission of additional options rather than by deliberate deception. For example, "Stacey spoke out against capitalism, therefore she must be a communist" (she may be neither capitalist nor communist). "Roger opposed an atheist argument against Christianity, so he must be a Christian" (When it's assumed the opposition by itself means he's a Christian). Roger might be an atheist who disagrees with the logic of some particular argument against Christianity. Additionally, it can be the result of habitual tendency, whatever the cause, to view the world with limited sets of options.

Some [[philosopher]]s and scholars believe that "unless a distinction can be made rigorous and precise it isn't really a distinction".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Derrida]] (1991) ''Afterword: Toward An Ethic of Discussion'', published in the English translation of ''[[Limited Inc.]]'', pp. 123–24, 126&lt;/ref&gt; An exception is [[analytic philosopher]] [[John Searle]], who called it an incorrect assumption that produces false dichotomies.&lt;ref name="Searle83"&gt;Searle, John. (1983) ''The Word Turned Upside Down''. The New York Review of Books, Volume 30, Number 16, October 27, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Searle insists that "it is a condition of the adequacy of a precise theory of an indeterminate phenomenon that it should precisely characterize that phenomenon as indeterminate; and a distinction is no less a distinction for allowing for a family of related, marginal, diverging cases."&lt;ref name="Searle83"/&gt; Similarly, when two options are presented, they often are, although not always, two extreme points on some spectrum of possibilities; this may lend credence to the larger argument by giving the impression that the options are [[mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]] of each other, even though they need not be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baronett|first1=Stan|title=Logic|date=2008|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=9780131933125|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZfjSDw4eq4C&amp;pg=PT101|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the options in false dichotomies typically are presented as being [[collectively exhaustive events|collectively exhaustive]], in which case the fallacy may be overcome, or at least weakened, by considering other possibilities, or perhaps by considering a whole spectrum of possibilities, as in [[fuzzy logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arfi|first1=Badredine|title=Linguistic fuzzy logic methods in social sciences|date=2010|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin, Germany|isbn=9783642133428|edition=1.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rlq8QMy7uTMC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===False choice===
The presentation of a ''false choice'' often reflects a deliberate attempt to eliminate several options that may occupy the middle ground on an issue. A common argument against [[noise pollution]] laws involves a false choice. It might be argued that in [[New York City]] noise should not be regulated, because if it were, the city would drastically change in a negative way. This argument assumes that, for example, a bar must be shut down to prevent disturbing levels of noise emanating from it after midnight. This ignores the fact that the bar could simply lower its noise levels, or install [[soundproofing]] structural elements to keep the noise from excessively transmitting onto others' properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Desantis, Nick|title=Data Shows Bars With Most Noise Complaints, But Is It Just Sound and Fury?|url=http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/noise-complaints/|accessdate=31 October 2015|work=The New York Times|date=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black-and-white thinking===

In psychology, a phenomenon related to the false dilemma is black-and-white thinking.

== Overview ==
Fusion adaptive resonance theory models is a natural extension of the original [[Adaptive resonance theory|adaptive resonance theory (ART)]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Grossberg, S. (1987), Competitive learning: From interactive activation to adaptive resonance, Cognitive Science (Publication), 11, 23-63&lt;/ref&gt; models developed by [[Stephen Grossberg]] and [[Gail Carpenter|Gail A. Carpenter]] from a single pattern field to multiple pattern channels. Whereas the original ART models perform unsupervised learning of recognition nodes in response to incoming input patterns, fusion ART learns multi-channel mappings simultaneously across multi-modal pattern channels in an [[online machine learning|online]] and [[incremental learning|incremental]] manner.

== The learning model ==
Fusion ART employs a multi-channel architecture (as shown below), comprising a category field &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; connected to a fixed number of (''K'') pattern channels or input fields &lt;math&gt;F_1^{c1},\dots,F_1^{cK}&lt;/math&gt; through bidirectional conditionable pathways. The model unifies a number of network designs, most notably Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART), Adaptive Resonance Associative Map (ARAM)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1995|title=Adaptive Resonance Associative Map|url=http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ASAHTan/Papers/ARAM%20NN95.pdf|journal=Neural Networks|volume=8|issue=3|pages=437–446|last1=Tan|first1=A.-H.|doi=10.1016/0893-6080(94)00092-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fusion Architecture for Learning and COgNition (FALCON),&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2008|title=Integrating Temporal Difference Methods and Self-Organizing Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning with Delayed Evaluative Feedback|url=http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ASAHTan/Papers/2008/TD-FALCON%20TNN%2004359212.pdf|journal=IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks|volume=9|issue=2|pages=230–244|author1=Tan, A.-H., Lu, N. |author2=Xiao, D }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed over the past decades for a wide range of functions and applications.

[[File:Fusion ART Architecture.jpg|frameless|500x500px]]

Given a set of multimodal patterns, each presented at a pattern channel, the fusion ART pattern encoding cycle comprises five key stages, namely code activation, code competition, activity readout, template matching, and template learning, as described below.
* '''Code activation:''' Given the input activity vectors &lt;math&gt;\vec{I}^{ck}&lt;/math&gt;, one for each input field &lt;math&gt;F_1^{ck}&lt;/math&gt;, the choice function &lt;math&gt;T_j&lt;/math&gt; of each &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; node ''j'' is computed based on the combined overall similarity between the input patterns and the corresponding weight vectors &lt;math&gt;\vec{w}_j^{ck}&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Code competition:''' A code competition process follows under which the &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; node with the highest choice function value is identified. The winner is indexed at ''J'' where &lt;math&gt;T_j&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum among all &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; nodes. This indicates a winner-take-all strategy.
* '''Activity readout:''' During memory recall, the chosen &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; node ''J'' performs a read out of its weight vectors to the input fields &lt;math&gt;F_1^{ck}&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Template matching:''' Before the activity readout is stabilized and node ''J'' can be used for learning, a template matching process checks that the weight templates of node ''J'' are sufficiently close to their respective input patterns. Specifically, resonance occurs if for each channel ''k'', the ''match function'' of the chosen node ''J'' meets its vigilance criterion.If any of the vigilance constraints is violated, mismatch reset occurs in which the value of the choice function &lt;math&gt;T_J&lt;/math&gt; is set to 0 for the duration of the input presentation. Using a ''match tracking'' process, at the beginning of each input presentation, the vigilance parameter in each channel ''ck'' equals a baseline vigilance. When a mismatch reset occurs, the vigilance of all pattern channels are increased simultaneously until one of them is slightly larger than its corresponding match function, causing a reset. The search process then selects another &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; node ''J'' under the revised vigilance criterion until a resonance is achieved.
* '''Template learning:''' Once a resonance occurs, for each channel ''ck'', the weight vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{w}_J^{ck}&lt;/math&gt; is modified according to a learning rule which moves it towards the input pattern. When an uncommitted node is selected for learning, it becomes ''committed'' and a new uncommitted node is added to the &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; field. Fusion ART thus expands its network architecture dynamically in response to the input patterns.

== Types of fusion ART ==
The network dynamics described above can be used to support numerous learning operations. We show how fusion ART can be used for a variety of traditionally distinct learning tasks in the subsequent sections.

=== Original ART models ===
With a single pattern channel, the fusion ART architecture reduces to the original ART model. Using a selected vigilance value $\rho$, an ART model learns a set of recognition nodes in response to an incoming stream of input patterns in a continuous manner. Each recognition node in the &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; field learns to encode a template pattern representing the key characteristics of a set of patterns. ART has been widely used in the context of unsupervised learning for discovering pattern groupings. Please refer to the selected ART literatures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; for a review of ART's functionalities, interpretations, and applications.

=== Adaptive resonance associative map ===
By synchronizing pattern coding across multiple pattern channels, fusion ART learns to encode associative mappings across distinct pattern spaces. A specific instance of fusion ART with two pattern channels is known as adaptive resonance associative map (ARAM), that learns multi-dimensional supervised mappings from one pattern space to another pattern space. An ARAM system consists of an input field &lt;math&gt;F_1^a&lt;/math&gt;,  an output field &lt;math&gt;F_1^b&lt;/math&gt;, and a category field &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt;. Given a set of feature vectors presented at &lt;math&gt;F_1^a&lt;/math&gt; with their corresponding class vectors presented at &lt;math&gt;F_1^b&lt;/math&gt;, ARAM learns a predictive model (encoded by the
recognition nodes in &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt;) that associates combinations of key features to their respective classes.

Fuzzy ARAM, based on fuzzy ART operations, has been successfully applied to numerous machine learning tasks, including personal profiling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tan | first1 = A.-H. | last2 = Soon | first2 = H.-S. | year = 2000 | title =  | url = | journal = proceedings, Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD'00), LNAI | volume = 1805 | issue = | pages = 173–176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; document classification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = He | first1 = J. | last2 = Tan | first2 = A.-H. | last3 = Tan | first3 = C.-L. | year = 2003 | title = On Machine Learning Methods for Chinese Document Classification | url = http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ASAHTan/Papers/TC%20APIN03.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Applied Intelligence | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 311–322 }}&lt;/ref&gt; personalized content management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tan | first1 = A.-H. | last2 = Ong | first2 = H.-L. | last3 = Pan | first3 = H. | last4 = Ng | first4 = J. | last5 = Li | first5 = Q.-X. | year = 2004 | title = Towards Personalized Web Intelligence | url = http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ASAHTan/Papers/TC%20APIN03.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Knowledge and Information Systems | volume = 6 | issue = 5| pages = 595–616 | doi=10.1007/s10115-003-0130-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DNA gene expression analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tan | first1 = A.-H. | last2 = Pan | first2 =  | year = 2005 | title = Predictive Neural Networks for Gene Expression Data Analysis | url = http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ASAHTan/Papers/Predictive%20NN%20for%20Gene%20Expression%20Analysis.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Neural Networks | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 297–306 | doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2005.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many benchmark experiments, ARAM has demonstrated predictive performance superior to those of many state-of-the-art machine learning systems, including C4.5, Backpropagation Neural Network, K Nearest Neighbour, and Support Vector Machines.

=== Fusion ART with domain knowledge ===
During learning, fusion ART formulates recognition categories of input patterns across multiple channels. The knowledge that fusion ART discovers during learning, is compatible with symbolic rule-based representation. Specifically, the recognition categories learned by the &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; category nodes are compatible with a class of IF-THEN rules that maps a set of input attributes (antecedents) in one pattern channel to a disjoint set of output attributes (consequents) in another channel. Due to this
compatibility, at any point of the [[incremental learning]] process, instructions in the form of IF-THEN rules can be readily translated into the recognition categories of a fusion ART system. The rules are conjunctive in the sense that the attributes in the
IF clause and in the THEN clause have an ''AND'' relationship. Augmenting a fusion ART network with domain knowledge through
explicit instructions serves to improve learning efficiency and predictive accuracy.

The fusion ART rule insertion strategy is similar to that used in Cascade ARTMAP, a generalization of ARTMAP that performs domain knowledge insertion, refinement, and extraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tan|first=A.-H.|date=1997|title=Cascade ARTMAP: Integrating Neural Computation and Symbolic Knowledge Processing|url=http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ASAHTan/Papers/Cascade%20ARTMAP-TNN97.pdf|journal=IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For direct knowledge insertion, the IF and THEN clauses of each instruction (rule) is translated into a pair of vectors A and B respectively. The vector pairs derived are then used
as training patterns for inserting into a fusion ART network. During rule insertion, the vigilance parameters are set to 1s to ensure that each distinct rule is encoded by one category node.

For details on integrating domain knowledge into fusion ART, please refer to a recent paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Teng | first1 = T.-H. | last2 = Tan | first2 = A.-H. | last3 = Zurada | first3 = J. | year = 2015 | title = Self-Organizing Neural Networks Integrating Domain Knowledge and Reinforcement Learning | url = http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/asahtan/Papers/2014/Self-Organizing%20Neural%20Network%20Integrating%20Domain%20Knowledge%20and%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20-%20TNNLS%202014.pdf | format = PDF | journal = IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems | volume = 26 | issue = 5| pages = 889–902 | doi=10.1109/tnnls.2014.2327636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fusion architecture for learning and cognition (FALCON) ===
Reinforcement learning is a paradigm wherein an autonomous system learns to adjust its behaviour based on
reinforcement signals received from the environment. An instance of fusion ART, known as FALCON (fusion architecture for learning and cognition), learns mappings simultaneously across multi-modal input patterns, involving states, actions, and rewards, in an [[online machine learning|online]] and [[incremental learning|incremental]] manner. Compared with other ART-based reinforcement learning systems, FALCON presents a truly
integrated solution in the sense that there is no implementation of a separate reinforcement learning module or Q-value table. Using competitive coding as the underlying principle of computation, the network dynamics encompasses several learning
paradigms, including unsupervised learning, supervised learning, as well as reinforcement learning.

FALCON employs a three-channel architecture, comprising a category field &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; and three pattern fields, namely a sensory field &lt;math&gt;F_1^{c1}&lt;/math&gt; for representing current states, a motor field &lt;math&gt;F_1^{c2}&lt;/math&gt; for representing actions, and a feedback field &lt;math&gt;F_1^{c3}&lt;/math&gt; for representing reward values. A class of FALCON networks, known as TD-FALCON,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; incorporates Temporal Difference (TD) methods to estimate and learn value function ''Q(s,a)'', that indicates the goodness to take a certain action ''a'' in a given state ''s''.

The general sense-act-learn algorithm for TD-FALCON is summarized. Given the current state ''s'', the FALCON network is used to predict the value of performing each available action ''a'' in the action set A based on the corresponding state vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{s}&lt;/math&gt; and action vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{a}&lt;/math&gt;. The value functions are then processed by an action selection strategy (also known as policy) to select an action. Upon receiving a feedback (if any) from the environment after performing the
action, a TD formula is used to compute a new estimate of the Q-value for performing the chosen action in the current state. The new Q-value is then used as the teaching signal (represented as reward vector R) for FALCON to learn the association of the current state and the chosen action to the estimated value.

The '''galaxy color–magnitude diagram''' shows the relationship between [[absolute magnitude]] (a measure of [[luminosity]]) and [[mass]] of [[galaxies]]. A preliminary description of the three areas of this diagram was made in 2003 by [[Eric F. Bell]] et al. from the [[COMBO-17]] survey&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Eric F. et al. ''Nearly 5000 Distant Early‐Type Galaxies in COMBO‐17: A Red Sequence and Its Evolution since z=1'', [[The Astrophysical Journal]], 608:752–767, 2004 June 20. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ApJ...608..752B]&lt;/ref&gt; that clarified the [[bimodal]] distribution of red and blue galaxies as seen in analysis of [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] data&lt;ref&gt;Strateva, I., et al. ''Color Separation of Galaxy Types in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Imaging Data'', 2001, The [[Astronomical Journal]], 122, 1861 [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001AJ....122.1861S]&lt;/ref&gt; and even in [[de Vaucouleurs]]' 1961 [[de Vaucouleurs modified Hubble sequence|analyses]] of [[Galaxy morphological classification|galaxy morphology]].&lt;ref&gt;de Vaucouleurs, G. ''Integrated Colors of Bright Galaxies in the u, b, V System.'' 1961, [[The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series]], 5, 233. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1961ApJS....5..233D]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Noticed in this diagram are three main features: the [[red sequence]], the [[green valley (astronomy)|green valley]], and the [[blue cloud]]. The red sequence includes most red galaxies which are generally [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]]. The blue cloud includes most blue galaxies which are generally [[spiral galaxy|spirals]]. In between the two distributions is an underpopulated space known as the green valley which includes a number of red spirals. 

Unlike the comparable [[Hertzsprung&amp;ndash;Russell diagram]] for [[star]]s, galaxy properties are not necessarily completely determined by their location on the color–magnitude diagram. The diagram also shows considerable evolution through time. The red sequence earlier in [[Big Bang|evolution]] of the [[universe]] was more constant in color across magnitudes and the blue cloud was not as uniformly distributed but showed sequence progression.

[[File:A Deep Look into a Dark Sky.jpg|thumb|One of five patches of sky covered by the COMBO-17 survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Deep Look into a Dark Sky|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1428a/|accessdate=8 August 2014|work=ESO Picture of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

New research suggests the green valley is actually composed of two different populations of galaxies: one of late-type galaxies, where star formation has been quenched due to their gas supplies being shut off followed by exhaustion of their gas reservoirs for several billion years, and another of early-type galaxies where both the gas supplies and gas reservoirs have been destroyed very quickly, likely because of [[galaxy merger|mergers with other galaxies]] and/or the presence of an [[active galactic nucleus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Green Valley is a Red Herring: Galaxy Zoo reveals two evolutionary pathways towards quenching of star formation in early- and late-type galaxies | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume=440 | issue=1 | pages=889 | date=2014 |author1=Schawinski, Kevin |author2=Urry, C.

The [[Milky Way]] and the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] are assumed to lie in the green valley because their star formation is slowing down due to running out of gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1088/0004-637X/736/2/84 | title=The Mid-life Crisis of the Milky Way and M31 | date=2011 | author=Mutch, S.J. | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=736 | issue=2 | pages=84 | last2=Croton | first2=D.J. | last3=Poole | first3=G.B. |bibcode = 2011ApJ...736...84M|arxiv = 1105.2564 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''gray ceiling''' is a [[social phenomenon|business/societal phenomenon]] where the existing workforce of those born during the [[baby boom]] era prevents the slightly younger [[Generation X]]ers from advancing or being promoted at their jobs.

==General==
The gray ceiling phenomenon is most likely unintentional{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. Although it is true that baby boomers are staying on the job longer than previous generations, by sheer number they are also competing within their own generation and their children who are joining the workforce at the turn of the 21st century.

As the children of the baby boomers advance from below, the [[Generation X|Gen-Xers]], usually with middle management jobs, feel threatened and trapped in a job that is going nowhere and might be given away to the next younger candidate.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

It is an introduction to the ''why''s of algorithms and data structures.
Features of the book:
#The design factors associated with problems 
#The creative process behind coming up with innovative solutions for [[algorithm]]s and [[data structure]]s
#The line of reasoning behind the constraints, factors and the design choices made.

The very fundamental algorithms portrayed by this book are mostly presented in [[Pseudocode]] and/or [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] notation.

An '''impairment rating''' is a percentage intended to represent the degree of an individual's impairment, which is a deviation away from one's normal health status and functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cocchiarella|first=Linda|title=Master the AMA Guides Fifth: A Medical and Legal Transition to Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition|year=2001|publisher=AMA Press|location=Chicago, Ill|isbn=978-1579471040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impairment is distinct from [[disability]]. An individual's impairment rating is based on the restrictive impact of an impairment, whereas disability is broadly the consequences one's impairment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Oosterom|first=FJ|author2=Ettema AM |author3=Mulder PG |title=Impairment and disability after severe hand injuries with multiple phalangeal fractures|journal=J.

The '''Intervasion of the UK''' was a 1994 [[Electronic Civil Disobedience|electronic civil disobedience]] and collective action against [[John Major]]'s [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice Bill]] which sought to outlaw outdoor dance festivals and "music with a repetitive beat". Launched by a group called The [[Zippies]] from [[San Francisco]]'s [[181 Club]] on [[Guy Fawkes Day]], November 5, 1994, it resulted in government websites going down for at least a week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medialternatives.blogetery.com/2010/12/15/intervasion-supports-anonymous Wikileaks Infowar not the first online protest action | Medialternatives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821141633/http://medialternatives.blogetery.com/2010/12/15/intervasion-supports-anonymous/ |date=2011-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It utilised a form of Distributed Denial of Service ([[DDoS]]) known as the [[E-mail bomb|Email bomb]] in order to overload servers as a form of [[online protest]] and [[Internet activism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medialternatives.blogetery.com/2011/02/07/2828/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215024709/http://medialternatives.blogetery.com/2011/02/07/2828/ |archivedate=2011-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first such use of the [[Internet]] and technology as a weapon of struggle and/or civil disobedience, and preceded the [[:it:Netstrike|1995 Italian NetStrike]].

==Campaign against the CJB==
Under the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994]], the definition of music played at a rave was given as: "music includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1994/ukpga_19940033_en_8#pt5-pb2 |title=Public Order: Collective Trespass or Nuisance on Land - Powers to remove trespassers on land - Powers to remove persons attending or preparing for a rave |work=Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 |publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]] |accessdate=2008-06-09| year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sections 63, 64 &amp; 65 of the Act targeted electronic dance music played at [[rave]]s. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act empowered police to stop a rave in the open air when "ten or more people are attending, or where two or more are making preparations for a rave". Section 65 allowed any uniformed constable who believes a person is on their way to a rave within a {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on}} radius to stop them and direct them away from the area; "non-compliant citizens may be subject to a maximum fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale (£1000)".{{citequote|date=May 2018}}

The Zippies sought to jam the mailboxes of UK politicians associated with the Bill in order to bring their attention to the issue of [[natural justice]] involving basic rights and freedoms. In effect, the collective action was saying: "If you take away our freedom, we have the power to take away something you take for granted, and to do this in a way which deploys the Internet as a weapon".{{citequote|date=May 2018}}

Several hackers not directly associated with the group launched all-out [[penetration testing]] and load testing operations against several UK government websites, resulting in a tit-for-tat battle, as the Zippies mailbox on morph.com went down, along with the entire server of Morph, a well-known Bay Area [[Bulletin board system|BBS]].

==Media Coverage==
The event was broadcast on Radio Free Berkeley.

The protest action occurred during the manhunt for [[Kevin Mitnick]] and was thus partly an underground event. The media also refused to entertain the implications of electronic civil disobedience, with public attention focused on the problem of illegal raves and black-hat hackers, prompting scare stories about "evil hackers" and "young hoodlums" penetrating the British defences while the zippies were written off as nothing more than electrohippies.

==Criticism==
Some criticism of the Intervasion was expressed by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] who complained about the "lack of a cutoff date"{{citequote|date=May 2018}}. Other criticism on the [[Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link]] (WELL) BBS centered on the use of militant language. The online protest action also suffered from conflict between its stated aims: "To clog the servers of the UK government", and its call to send email messages to UK politicians. Thus jamming mailboxes with email and large file attachments defeated the purpose of the exercise which was essentially an early form of hacktivism. The nature of the collective action was also not articulated well enough. For instance, the digital be-in which occurred during the launch of [[Timothy Leary]]'s Chaos and Cyberculture, in which Leary was "kidnapped" without the consent of his publisher, and "forced" to DDoS the UK government, was simply a protest message, sent repeatedly to mail-boxes around the world.

KHOPCA (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-hop clustering algorithm) provides a fully [[Distributed computing|distributed]] and localized approach to group elements such as nodes in a network according to their distance from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brust|first=Matthias R.|last2=Frey|first2=Hannes|last3=Rothkugel|first3=Steffen|date=2007-01-01|title=Adaptive Multi-hop Clustering in Mobile Networks|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1378063.1378086|journal=Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Mobile Technology, Applications, and Systems and the 1st International Symposium on Computer Human Interaction in Mobile Technology|series=Mobility '07|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=132–138|doi=10.1145/1378063.1378086|isbn=9781595938190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brust|first=Matthias R.|last2=Frey|first2=Hannes|last3=Rothkugel|first3=Steffen|date=2008-01-01|title=Dynamic Multi-hop Clustering for Mobile Hybrid Wireless Networks|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1352793.1352820|journal=Proceedings of the 2Nd International Conference on Ubiquitous Information Management and Communication|series=ICUIMC '08|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=130–135|doi=10.1145/1352793.1352820|isbn=9781595939937}}&lt;/ref&gt; KHOPCA  operates proactively through a simple set of rules that defines clusters, which are optimal with respect to the applied distance function.

KHOPCA's clustering process explicitly supports joining and leaving of nodes, which makes KHOPCA suitable for highly dynamic networks. However, it has been demonstrated that KHOPCA also performs in static networks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Besides applications in ad hoc and [[wireless sensor network]]s, KHOPCA can be used in localization and navigation problems, networked [[Swarm intelligence|swarming]], and real-time [[Cluster analysis|data clustering and analysis]].

== Algorithm description ==
KHOPCA (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-hop clustering algorithm) operates proactively through a simple set of rules that defines clusters with variable &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-hops. A set of local rules describes the state transition between nodes. A node's weight is determined only depending on the current state of its neighbors in communication range. Each node of the network is continuously involved in this process. As result, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-hop clusters are formed and maintained in static as well as dynamic networks.

KHOPCA does not require any predetermined initial configuration. Therefore, a node can potentially choose any weight (between &lt;math display="inline"&gt;MIN&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;MAX&lt;/math&gt;). However, the choice of the initial configuration does influence the convergence time.

=== Initialization ===
The prerequisites in the start configuration for the application of the rules are the following.
* &lt;math&gt;\Nu&lt;/math&gt; is the network with nodes and links, whereby each node has a weight &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.
* Each node &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Nu&lt;/math&gt; node stores the same positive values &lt;math display="inline"&gt;MIN&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;MAX&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math display="inline"&gt;MIN &lt; MAX&lt;/math&gt;.
* A node &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; with weight &lt;math display="inline"&gt;w_n=MAX&lt;/math&gt; is called cluster center.
* &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math display="inline"&gt;MAX&lt;/math&gt; - &lt;math display="inline"&gt;MIN&lt;/math&gt; and represents the maximum size a cluster can have from the most outer node to the cluster center. The cluster diameter is therefore &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k\cdot2-1&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\Nu(n)&lt;/math&gt; returns the direct neighbors of node &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math display="inline"&gt;W(\Nu)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of weights of all nodes of &lt;math&gt;\Nu&lt;/math&gt;.
The following rules describe the state transition for a node &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; with weight &lt;math display="inline"&gt;w_n&lt;/math&gt;. These rules have to be executed on each node in the order described here.

=== Rule 1 ===
[[File:KHOPCA rule 1.png|thumb|KHOPCA rule 1]]
The first rule has the function of constructing an order within the cluster. This happens through a node &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; detects the direct neighbor with the highest weight &lt;math display="inline"&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, which is higher than the node's own weight &lt;math display="inline"&gt;w_n&lt;/math&gt;. If such a direct neighbor is detected, the node &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; changes its own weight to be the weight of the highest weight within the neighborhood subtracted by 1. Applied iteratively, this process creates a top-to-down hierarchical cluster structure.&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="java" line="1"&gt;
if max(W(N(n))) &gt; w_n
    w_n = max(W(N(n))) - 1
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Rule 2 ===
[[File:KHOPCA rule 2 a.png|thumb|KHOPCA rule 2]]
The second rule deals with the situation where nodes in a neighborhood are on the minimum weight level. This situation can happen if, for instance, the initial configuration assigns the minimum weight to all nodes. If there is a neighborhood with all nodes having the minimum weight level, the node &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; declares itself as cluster center. Even if coincidently all nodes declare themselves as cluster centers, the conflict situation will be resolved by one of the other rules.&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="java" line="1"&gt;
if max(W(N(n)) == MIN &amp; w_n == MIN
    w_n = MAX;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Rule 3 ===
[[File:KHOPCA rule 3 a.png|thumb|KHOPCA rule 3]]
The third rule describes situations where nodes with leveraged weight values, which are not cluster centers, attract surrounding nodes with lower weights. This behavior can lead to fragmented clusters without a cluster center. In order to avoid fragmented clusters, the node with higher weight value is supposed to successively decrease its own weight with the objective to correct the fragmentation by allowing the other nodes to reconfigure according to the rules. &lt;syntaxhighlight lang="java" line="1"&gt;
if max(W(N(n))) &lt;= w_n &amp;&amp; w_n != MAX
    w_n = w_n - 1;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Rule 4 ===
[[File:KHOPCA rule 4 a.png|thumb|KHOPCA rule 4]]
The fourth rule resolves the situation where two cluster centers connect in 1-hop neighborhood and need to decide which cluster center should continue its role as cluster center. Given any specific criterion (e.g., device ID, battery power), one cluster center remains while the other cluster center is hierarchized in 1-hop neighborhood to that new cluster center. The choice of the specific criterion to resolve the decision-making depends on the used application scenario and on the available information. &lt;syntaxhighlight lang="java" line="1"&gt;
if max(W(N(n)) == MAX &amp;&amp; w_n == MAX
    w_n = apply criterion to select a node from set (max(W(N(n)),w_n);
    w_n = w_n - 1;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Examples ==

=== 1-D ===
An exemplary sequence of state transitions applying the described four rules is illustrated below.

It has been demonstrated that KHOPCA terminates after a finite number of state transitions in static networks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Krvna Osveta''' ({{lang-sr|Крвна освета}}, '''''[[Blood feud]]''''') is a [[law]] of [[Feud|vendetta]] in [[Montenegro]] and [[Herzegovina]], practised by [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], [[Serbs]], [[Bosniaks]] and [[Albanians of Montenegro|Albanian families]] throughout history since medieval times. It is an oath of revenge for vendetta, meaning that the person must take revenge on whomever killed his relative by killing the murderer or one of the murderer's close relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Zora Latinovic, ''Krvna Osveta'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice started in [[the Balkans]] in the 15th century, under [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] rule and the law decreased in the 19th century, when the Balkan countries slowly got their independence from the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="glas-javnosti"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2005/07/29/srpski/F05072802.shtml |title=glas-javnosti |publisher=arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs|accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In pre-Ottoman [[Serbian lands|Serbian principalities]], [[blood money (term)|blood money]] (''Vražda'') was paid, one half went to the Serbian Orthodox Church, while the other to the victim's family. Stefan Uroš (1240–1272) talks about the Vražda in his works. After Ottoman conquest of [[Serbia]], self-governing clans often feuded with each other. Families in Serbia abandoned the tradition as the bigger threats to family integrity was ethnic Albanians and Turks rather than of their own ethnic group.

When a family member has been killed, the perpetrator's family&lt;sup&gt;(Bratstva)&lt;/sup&gt; has a "Blood debt" (''krvni dug'') which can only be removed when the victim's family (an appointed member, ''osvetnik'') has had their revenge by killing the aggressor or any member of the murderer's family (Often a close male kinsman, preferably the brother, killing of children was not encouraged). Only then has the family of the victim received peace (However, the blood feud continues if a relative decides to revenge, disregardless of who started).&lt;ref name="BF" /&gt; However, killing in your own house is the worst action, representing unmorality, which is a great shame in Montenegrin and Albanian cultures. If a criminal was murdered, it often did not result in a feud as criminality was negative in the eyes of society, but in some cases the criminal's family went on to kill serdars and other high ranked people.

*In Montenegro, the feuds were predominantly among [[Montenegrins]] and [[Albanians of Montenegro|ethnic Albanians]] themselves.
*In Herzegovina (currently a region of both Montenegro and [[Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina]]) [[Montenegrins]] had feuds with each other. A neutral region was Grahovo and Vučja Zuba (triangle of [[Boka Kotorska]], [[Montenegro]] and Herzegovina) where blood feuds were not recorded.
*In [[Old Serbia]] ([[Kosovo]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]) If a Serb had a weak family, he could be protected by an Albanian bratstva from other [[Albanians]] in exchange for anything from [[weapons]] or [[folk attire]] [[textile|material]] (Serbs had rich textile art in the southern Serbian regions)

The Osveta is not limited to males, females that have their husbands or relatives killed could take on the ''blood debt'', an instance is recorded from the [[Bjelopavlići (clan)|Bjelopavlići clan]], where a widow took out revenge for the murder of her husband.&lt;ref name="BF"&gt;{{Google books |id=oq4B2WGT9mYC |title=Blood Revenge: The Enactment and Management of Conflict in Montenegro and Other Tribal Societies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a bratstva finds and captures a thief or murderer (in connection to the bratstva) they could go to the person's house or relatives and tell them that their relative is a murderer or thief and end with something like "If we kill him, we are not to be held for" If the relatives answers "Do what you like with him" -the bratstva, if they kill the captive, they don't have a blood debt to his relatives because they settled his fate.

The blood feuds resulted in major instability in Montenegro, Kosovo and diaspora of Montenegrins in later centuries. In [[Kosovo]], most cases of blood feuds were reconciled in the early 1990s in the course of a large-scale reconciliation movement to end blood feuds led by [[Anton Çetta]].&lt;ref name="BJC2017"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://academic.oup.com/bjc/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bjc/azx002/2990197 |title=Did Nonviolent Resistance Fail in Kosovo? |last1=Marsavelski |first1=Aleksandar |last2=Sheremeti |first2=Furtuna |last3=Braithwaite |first3=John |website=British Journal of Criminology |accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest reconciliation gathering took place at Verrat e Llukës on 1 May 1990, which had between 100,000 and 500,000 participants. By 1992 the reconciliation campaign ended at least 1,200 deadly blood feuds, and in 1993 not a single homicide occurred in Kosovo.&lt;ref name="BJC2017" /&gt;

==History==

===Early estimates===
[[Image:Francis Galton.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Sir Francis Galton]]]]
[[Sir Francis Galton]] was one of the first scientists to apply the lexical hypothesis to the study of personality,&lt;ref name="personality determinants" /&gt; stating:

{{quote|I tried to gain an idea of the number of the more conspicuous aspects of the character by counting in an appropriate dictionary the words used to express them... I examined many pages of its index here and there as samples of the whole, and estimated that it contained fully one thousand words expressive of character, each of which has a separate shade of meaning, while each shares a large part of its meaning with some of the rest.&lt;ref name="Galton"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://galton.org/essays/1880-1889/galton-1884-fort-rev-measurement-character.pdf | title=Measurement of Character | author=Galton, F. | journal=Fortnightly Review | year=1884 | volume=36 | pages=179–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|181}} |Francis Galton |''Measurement of Character'', 1884}}

Despite Galton's early ventures into the lexical study of personality, over two decades passed before English-language scholars continued his work. A 1910 study by [[George E. Partridge|G. E. Partridge]] listed approximately 750 English adjectives used to describe mental states,&lt;ref name="partridge"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/PartridgeGE-1910 |title=An Outline of Individual Study | publisher=Sturgis &amp; Walton | author=Partridge, G. E. | year=1910 | location=New York | pages=106–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a 1926 study of [[Webster's Dictionary|Webster's New International Dictionary]] by M. L. Perkins provided an estimate of 3,000 such terms.&lt;ref name="perkins"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/OAS/oas_pdf/v06/p344_347.pdf | title=The teaching of ideals and the development of the traits of character and personality | author=Perkins, M. L. | journal=Proceedings of the Oklahoma Academy of Sciences | year=1926 | volume=6 | issue=2 | pages=344–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early explorations and estimates were not limited to the English-speaking world, with philosopher and psychologist Ludwig Klages stating in 1929 that the German language contains approximately 4,000 words to describe inner states.&lt;ref name="klages"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Science of Character | publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin | author=Klages, L. | year=1929 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psycholexical studies===

====Allport &amp; Odbert====
[[File:Gordon Allport.gif|right|thumb|[[Gordon Allport]]]]
Nearly half a century after Galton first investigated the lexical hypothesis, Franziska Baumgarten published the first psycholexical classification of personality-descriptive terms. Using dictionaries and [[characterology]] publications, Baumgarten identified 1,093 separate terms in the German language used in the description of personality and mental states.&lt;ref name="allport and odbert"&gt;{{cite book | title=Trait-names: A psycho-lexical study. | publisher=Psychological Review Company | author1=Allport, G. W.|author2=Odbert, H. S. | year=1936 | location=Albany, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this figure is similar in size to the German and English estimates offered by earlier researchers, [[Gordon Allport]] and Henry S. Odbert revealed this to be a severe underestimate in a 1936 study. Similar to the earlier work of M. L. Perkins, they used [[Webster's Dictionary|Webster's New International Dictionary]] as their source. From this list of approximately 400,000 words, Allport and Odbert identified 17,953 unique terms used to describe personality or behavior.&lt;ref name="allport and odbert" /&gt;

This is one of the most influential psycholexical studies in the history of [[Trait theory|trait psychology]].&lt;ref name="personality determinants" /&gt; Not only was it the longest, most exhaustive list of personality-descriptive words at the time,&lt;ref name="personality determinants" /&gt; it was also one of the earliest attempts at classifying English-language terms with the use of psychological principles. Using their list of nearly 18,000 terms, Allport and Odbert separated these into four categories or "columns":&lt;ref name="allport and odbert" /&gt;

:''Column I'': This group contains 4,504 terms that describe or are related to personality traits. Being the most important of the four columns to Allport and Odbert and future psychologists,&lt;ref name="personality determinants" /&gt; its terms most closely relate to those used by modern personality psychologists (e.g., [[Aggression|aggressive]], [[introverted]], sociable). Allport and Odbert suggested that this column represented a minimum rather than final list of trait terms. Because of this, they recommended that other researchers consult the remaining three columns in their studies.&lt;ref name="allport and odbert" /&gt;

:''Column II'': In contrast with the more stable [[disposition]]s described by terms in Column I, this group includes terms describing present states, [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[emotion]]s, and [[Mood (psychology)|moods]] (e.g., rejoicing, frantic). Reflecting this focus on temporary states, [[Present participle#Modern English|present participles]] represent the majority of the 4,541 terms in Column II.

:''Column III'': The largest of the four groups, Column III contains 5,226 words related to social evaluations of an individual's character (e.g., worthy, insignificant). Unlike the previous two columns, this group does not refer to internal psychological attributes of a person. As such, Allport and Odbert acknowledged that Column III did not meet their definition of trait-related terms. Predating the [[person-situation debate]] by over 30 years,&lt;ref name="person-sit2"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The person-situation debate in historical and current perspective | author1=Epstein, S.|author2=O'Brien, E. J. | journal=Psychological Bulletin |date=November 1985 | volume=98 | issue=3 | pages=513–537 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.98.3.513}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allport and Odbert included this group to appease researchers in [[social psychology]], [[sociology]], and ethics.&lt;ref name="allport and odbert" /&gt;

:''Column IV'': The last of Allport and Odbert's four columns contained 3,682 words. Called the "miscellaneous column" by the authors, Column IV contains important personality-descriptive terms that did not fit into the other three columns. Allport and Odbert offered potential subgroups for terms describing behaviors (e.g., pampered, crazed), [[Somatotype and constitutional psychology|physical qualities associated with psychological traits]] (e.g., lean, roly-poly), and talents or abilities (e.g., gifted, prolific). However, they noted that these subdivisions were not necessarily accurate, as: (i) innumerable subgroups were possible, (ii) these subgroups would not incorporate all of the miscellaneous terms, and (iii) further editing might reveal that these terms ''do'' fit into the other three columns.&lt;ref name="allport and odbert" /&gt;

Allport and Odbert did not present these four columns as representing [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] concepts. Many of their nearly 18,000 terms could have been differently classified or placed into multiple categories, particularly those in Columns I and II. Although the authors attempted to remedy this with the aid of three outside editors, the average level of agreement between these independent reviewers was approximately 47%. Noting that each outside judge seemed to have a preferred column, the authors decided to present the classifications performed by Odbert. Rather than try to [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalize]] this decision, Allport and Odbert presented the results of their study as somewhat arbitrary and unfinished.&lt;ref name="allport and odbert" /&gt;

====Warren Norman====
Throughout the 1940s, researchers such as [[Raymond Cattell]]&lt;ref name="cattell 1943"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The description of personality: Basic traits resolved into clusters | author=Cattell, R. B. | journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |date=October 1943 | volume=38 | issue=4 | pages=476–506 | doi=10.1037/h0054116}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Donald W. Fiske|Donald Fiske]]&lt;ref name="fiske 1949"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Consistency of the factorial structures of personality ratings from different sources | author=Fiske, D. W. | journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |date=July 1949 | volume=44 | issue=3 | pages=329–344 | doi=10.1037/h0057198}}&lt;/ref&gt; used [[factor analysis]] to explore the overarching structure of the trait terms in Allport and Odbert's Column I. Rather than rely on the factors obtained by these researchers,&lt;ref name="personality determinants" /&gt; Warren Norman conducted an independent analysis of Allport and Odbert's terms in 1963.&lt;ref name="norman 1963"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1964-00986-001 | title=Toward an adequate taxonomy of personality attributes: Replicated factor structure in peer nomination personality ratings | author=Norman, W.

T. | year=1967 | location=Ann Arbor, MI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the 1961 edition of Webster's International Dictionary, Norman added relevant terms and removed those from Allport and Odbert's list that were no longer in use. This resulted in a source list of approximately 40,000 potential trait-descriptive terms. Using this list, Norman then removed terms that were deemed archaic or obsolete, solely evaluative, overly obscure, dialect-specific, loosely related to personality, and purely physical. By doing so, Norman reduced his original list to 2,797 unique trait-descriptive terms.&lt;ref name="normans descriptors" /&gt; Norman's work would eventually serve as the basis for Dean Peabody and [[Lewis Goldberg|Lewis Goldberg's]] explorations of the Big Five personality traits.&lt;ref name="goldberg"&gt;{{cite book | title=Problems with Language Imprecision: New Directions for Methodology of Social and Behavioral Science | publisher=Jossey-Bass | author=Fiske, D.

====Juri Apresjan and the Moscow Semantic School====
In the 1970s, [[:ru:Апресян, Юрий Дереникович|Juri Apresjan]], a thought leader of the Moscow Semantic School, developed the systemic, or systematic, approach to [[lexicography]] which utilizes the concept of ''the language picture of the world''. Also the concept is called ''the naive picture of the world'' in order to stress the non-scientific view of the world which is imprinted in natural language.&lt;ref name="Apresian"&gt;{{cite book|last=Apresi͡an|first=I͡Uriĭ Derenikovich|title=Systematic Lexicography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WWPf0c024E8C|accessdate=14 January 2014|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-823780-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book "Systematic Lexicography", which was published in English in 2000, J.D.Apresjan puts forward the idea of building dictionaries on the basis of "reconstructing the so-called naive picture of the world, or the "world-view", underlying the partly universal and partly language specific pattern of conceptualizations inherent in any natural language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euralex.org/elx_proceedings/Euralex1992_1/006_Jurij%20D.%20Apresjan%20-Systemic%20lexicography.pdf |title=Apresjan J. (1992). Systemic Lexicography. In Euralex-92 Proceedings (part 1). p.4 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, the general world-view can be fragmented into different more local pictures of reality, such as naive geometry, naive physics, naive psychology, and so forth. In particular, one chapter of the book Apresjan allots to the description of lexicographic reconstruction of ''the language picture of the human being'' in the Russian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Apresi͡an|first=I͡Uriĭ Derenikovich|title=Systematic Lexicography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WWPf0c024E8C|accessdate=14 January 2014|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-823780-8|pages=101–143|chapter=The Picture of Man as Reconstructed from Linguistic Data: An Attempt at a Systematic Description}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, Apresjan's work laid basis for Sergey Golubkov's further attempts to build "the language personality theory"&lt;ref&gt;[http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/golubkov.html ''the language personality theory'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golubkov S.V. (2002). The language personality theory: An integrative approach to personality on the basis of its language phenomenology. Social Behavior and Personality, 30 (6), 571-578.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/expert/psychnews/5_1/pn5_1d.htm Golubkov S. (2000). The Language Model of Personality and its Perspectives Within Psychology. PsychNews International, 5 (1).]&lt;/ref&gt; which would be different from other lexically-based personality theories (e.g. by Allport, Cattell, Eysenck, etc.) due to its [[Meronomy|meronomic (partonomic)]] nature versus the [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] nature of the previously mentioned personality theories.&lt;ref&gt;Golubkov S.V. (2002). The language personality theory: An integrative approach to personalityon the basis of its language phenomenology. SocialBehavior and Personality, 30 (6), p. 573&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar concepts==

===Philosophy===
Concepts similar to the lexical hypothesis are at the root of [[ordinary language philosophy]].&lt;ref name="de raad"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Five big, Big Five issues: Rationale, content, structure, status, and crosscultural assessment | author=De Raad, B. | journal=European Psychologist |date=June 1998 | volume=3 | issue=2 | pages=113–124 | doi=10.1027/1016-9040.3.2.113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the use of the lexical hypothesis to understand personality, ordinary language philosophers propose that philosophical problems can be solved or better understood through an exploration of everyday language. In his essay "A Plea for Excuses," [[J. L. Austin]] cited three main justifications for this approach: words are tools, words are not only facts or things, and commonly used words "embod[y] all the distinctions men have found worth drawing...we are using a sharpened awareness of words to sharpen our perception of, though not as the final arbiter of, the phenomena."&lt;ref name="philosophical papers"&gt;{{cite book | title=Philosophical Papers | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Austin, J. L. | authorlink=A Plea for Excuses | year=1970 | location=London | pages=175–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|182}}

==Criticism==
Despite its widespread use in the study of personality, the lexical hypothesis has been challenged for a number of reasons. The following list describes some of the major critiques levelled against the lexical hypothesis and personality models founded on psycholexical studies.&lt;ref name="defence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lexical history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="de raad" /&gt;&lt;ref name="history of pers"&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of Personality Psychology: Theory, Science, and Research from Hellenism to the Twenty-first Century | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Dumont, F. | authorlink=Trait theories and the psychology of individual differences. | year=2010 | location=New York | pages=149–182 | isbn=978-0-521-11632-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* That the lexical hypothesis uses verbal descriptors in investigation of behavioural individual differences is viewed as a methodological flaw in this method when applied to personality theory.&lt;ref name=Plos&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trofimova|first1=IN|year=2014|title=Observer bias: an interaction of temperament traits with biases in the semantic perception of lexical material.|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9 | issue = 1 | pages=e85677. |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0085677|pmid=24475048|pmc=3903487}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, there is a natural pro-social bias of language in people’s verbal evaluations. Language is an invention of group dynamics that was developed to facilitate socialization, the exchange of information and the synchronization of group activity. This social function of language therefore creates a sociability bias in verbal descriptors of human behaviour: there are more words related to social than physical or even mental aspects of behavior. The sheer number of such descriptors will cause them to group into a largest factor in any language, and such grouping has nothing to do with the way that core systems of individual differences are set up. Second, there is also a negativity bias in [[emotionality]] (i.e., most emotions have negative affectivity), and there are more words in language to describe negative rather than positive emotions. Such asymmetry in emotional valence creates another bias in language. Experiments using the lexical hypothesis approach indeed demonstrated that the use of lexical material skews the resulting dimensionality according to a sociability bias of language and a negativity bias of emotionality, grouping all evaluations around these two dimensions.&lt;ref name="Plos"/&gt; This means that the two largest dimensions in the Big Five model of personality (i.e., Extraversion and Neuroticism) might be just an artifact of the lexical approach that this model employed. 
* Many traits of psychological importance are too complex to be encoded into single terms or used in everyday language.&lt;ref name="block"&gt;{{cite journal | title=A contrarian view of the five-factor approach to personality description. | author=Block, J. | journal=Psychological Bulletin |date=March 1995 | volume=117 | issue=2 | pages=187–215 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.117.2.187 | pmid=7724687}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, an entire text may be the only way to accurately capture and reflect some important personality characteristics.&lt;ref name="mccrae openness"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Openness to experience: Expanding the boundaries of Factor V | author=McCrae, R.

* Laypeople use personality-descriptive terms in an ambiguous manner.&lt;ref name="westen"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://psychsystems.net/Publications/1996/2.%20uncovering%20the%20nomothetic%20from%20the%20idiographic_Westen_jrnl%20of%20research%20in%20pers%201996.pdf | title=A model and a method for uncovering the nomothetic from the idiographic: An alternative to the Five-Factor Model | author=Westen, D. | journal=Journal of Research in Personality | date=September 1996 | volume=30 | issue=3 | pages=400–413 | doi=10.1006/jrpe.1996.0028 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507121610/http://www.psychsystems.net/Publications/1996/2.%20uncovering%20the%20nomothetic%20from%20the%20idiographic_Westen_jrnl%20of%20research%20in%20pers%201996.pdf | archivedate=7 May 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, many of the terms used in psycholexical studies are too ambiguous to be useful in a psychological context.&lt;ref name="ordinary language"&gt;{{cite book | title=Personality Description in Ordinary Language | publisher=WIley | author=Bromley, D. B. | year=1977 | location=London | isbn=9780471994435}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The lexical hypothesis relies on terms that were not developed by experts.&lt;ref name="history of pers" /&gt; As such, any models developed with the lexical hypothesis reflect lay perceptions rather than expert psychological knowledge.&lt;ref name="westen" /&gt;
* Language accounts for a minority of communication and is inadequate to describe much of human experience.&lt;ref name="mehrabian"&gt;{{cite book | title=Silent Messages | publisher=Wadsworth | author=Mehrabian, A. | year=1971 | location=Belmont, CA | isbn=0-534-00910-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The mechanisms that led to the development of personality lexicons are poorly understood.&lt;ref name="lexical history" /&gt;
* Personality-descriptive terms change over time and differ in meaning across dialects, languages, and cultures.&lt;ref name="lexical history" /&gt;
* The methods used to test the lexical hypothesis are unscientific.&lt;ref name="westen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="versus"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Big Five versus nobody? | author1=Shadel, W.

* Personality-descriptive language is too broad to be captured with a single [[Part of speech|word class]],&lt;ref name="de raad 2"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Personality-descriptive verbs | author1=De Raad, B.|author2=Mulder, E.|author3=Kloosterman, K.|author4=Hofstee, W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1776">A '''logical [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]''' is a special type of diagramatic structure in any one of several systems of graphical [[syntax (logic)|syntax]] that [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] developed for [[logic]].

In his papers on ''[[qualitative logic]]'', ''[[entitative graph]]s'', and ''[[existential graph]]s'', Peirce developed several versions of a graphical [[formal system|formalism]], or a graph-theoretic [[formal language]], designed to be interpreted for logic.

In the century since Peirce initiated this line of development, a variety of formal systems have branched out from what is abstractly the same formal base of graph-theoretic structures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3909">'''Mathematicism''' is any [[opinion]], [[Point of view (philosophy)|viewpoint]], [[school of thought]], or [[philosophy]] that states that everything can be described/defined/modelled ultimately by [[mathematics]], or that the [[universe]] and [[reality]] (both [[matter (philosophy)|material]] and [[mind|mental]]/[[spirit]]ual) are fundamentally/fully/only mathematical, i.e. that 'everything is mathematics' necessitating the ideas of [[logic]], [[reason]], [[mind]], and [[spirit]].

==Overview==
Mathematicism is a form of [[rationalist]] [[idealist]] or [[mentalism (philosophy)|mentalist]]/[[spiritualism (philosophy)|spiritualist]] [[monism]]).  The idea started in [[Western civilization|the West]] with [[ancient Greece]]'s [[Pythagoreanism]], and continued in other rationalist idealist schools of thought such as [[Platonism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Markus Gabriel|Gabriel, Markus]]. ''Fields of Sense: A New Realist Ontology''. Edinburgh: Edinburgh Univ. Press, 2015, ch. 4. Limits of Set-Theoretical Ontology and Contemporary Nihilism.&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'mathematicism' has additional meanings among Cartesian idealist philosophers and mathematicians, such as describing the ability and process to study reality mathematically.&lt;ref&gt;Sasaki, Chikara, ''Descartes’s Mathematical Thought'', Springer, 2013, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gilson&gt;[[Étienne Gilson|Gilson, Étienne]]. ''The Unity of Philosophical Experience. San Francisco, CA: Ignatius Press'', 1999, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematicism includes (but is not limited to) the following (chronological order):
* [[Pythagoreanism]] ([[Pythagoras]] said 'All things are numbers,' 'Number rules all,' though contemporary mathematicists exclude numerology, etc., from mathematicism)
* [[Platonism]] (paraphrases [[Pythagoras]]' mathematicism)
* [[Neopythagoreanism]]
* [[Neoplatonism]] (brought [[Aristoteleanism|Aristotelean]] [[mathematical logic]] to Platonism)
* [[Cartesianism]] ([[René Descartes]] applied mathematical reasoning to philosophy)&lt;ref name=Gilson /&gt;
* [[Leibnizianism]] ([[Gottfried Leibniz]] was a [[mathematician]], called beings '[[monad (philosophy)|monad]]s,' which also means 'units')
* [[Alain Badiou]]'s philosophy
* [[Physicist]] [[Max Tegmark]]'s [[mathematical universe hypothesis]] (MUH) described as Pythagoreanism–Platonism
* [[Tim Maudlin]]'s project of 'philosophical mathematics,' a project aiming at constructing 'a rigorous mathematical structure using primitive terms that give a natural fit with physics' and investigating 'why mathematics should provide such a powerful language for describing the physical world.'&lt;ref name=Maudlin&gt;Maudlin, Tim. ''New Foundations for Physical Geometry: The Theory of Linear Structures''. Oxford University Press. 2014, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Maudlin, 'the most satisfying possible answer to such a question is: Because the physical world literally has a mathematical structure.'&lt;ref name=Maudlin/&gt;

[[Morality]] is “the ability to distinguish right from wrong, to act on this distinction and to experience pride when we do the right things and guilt or shame when we do not.” Both Piaget  and Kohlberg &lt;ref name="a"/&gt; made significant contributions to this area of study. Developmental psychologists have divided the subject of morality into three main topics: affective element, cognitive element, and behavioral element. The affective element consists of the emotional response to actions that may be considered right or wrong. This is the emotional part of morality that covers the feeling of guilt as well as empathy. The cognitive element focuses on how people use social cognitive processes to determine what actions are right or wrong. For example, if an eight-year-old child was informed by an authoritative adult not to eat the cookies in the jar and then was left in the room alone with the cookies, what is going on in the child's brain? The child may think “I really want that cookie, but it would be wrong to eat it and I will get into trouble.” Lastly, the behavioral element targets how people behave when they are being enticed to deceive or when they are assisting someone who needs help.

== Moral Affect ==
Moral affect is “emotion related to matters of right and wrong”. Such emotion includes shame, guilt, embarrassment, and pride. Shame is correlated with the disapproval by one's peers. Guilt is correlated with the disapproval of oneself. Embarrassment is feeling disgraced while in the public eye. Pride is a feeling generally brought about by positive opinion of oneself when admired by one's peers &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~steve/Tangney.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Empathy]] is also tied in with moral affect and is an emotional unfolding that allows you to be able to understand how another person feels. If we see someone is crying, then we also feel sad. If someone has just accomplished a lifelong goal, we bask in his happiness. Empathy falls under the affective component of morality and is the main reasoning behind selflessness. According to theorist Martin Hoffman, empathy plays a key role in the progression of morality. Empathy causes people to be more prominent in prosocial behavior as discussed earlier. Without empathy, there would be no humanity.

== Moral Reasoning ==
Moral reasoning is the thinking process involved in deciding whether an act is right or wrong.&lt;ref name=a&gt;Sigelman, Carol K., and David R. Shaffer. Life-span Human Development. Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole Pub., 1991. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Feeds off the development of social cognition that helps us experience other people's distress. These skills also allow us to go beyond our egocentrism to construct a concept of reciprocity and fairness. According to piaget and kholberg, Moral reasoning progresses through a constant sequence, a very fixed and universal order of stages, each of which contains a consistent way of thinking about moral issues that are all distinct from one another.

=== Jean Piaget’s view ===

Jean Piaget's view: Jean Piaget &lt;ref&gt;http://tigger.uic.edu/~lnucci/MoralEd/overview.html&lt;/ref&gt; was the first psychologist to suggest a theory of moral development. According to Piaget, development only emerges with action, and a person constructs and reconstructs his knowledge of the world as the result of new interactions with his environment. Piaget said that people pass through three different stages of moral reasoning: Premoral period, heteronomous morality, and Autonomous morality. The first stage, premoral, occurs during the preschool years: children show very little awareness or understanding of rules and cannot be considered moral beings. The next stage, heteronomous which is defined as under the rule of another, and it involves children ages 6 to 10 years old. The child will take rules more seriously, believing that they are handed down by authority figures and are sacred and never to be altered. No matter if the intentions were good or bad, any violator to these passed-down rules will be judged as wrongdoing. The last stage, Autonomous, appears at 10 to 11 years of age. Children begin to appreciate that rules are agreements between individuals.

=== Lawrence Kohlberg’s view ===

Lawrence Kohlberg's view: Influenced by Piaget's work, Kohlberg created an influential cognitive development theory of moral development. Like Piaget, Kohlberg formulated that moral growth occurs in a very universal and consistent sequence of three moral levels, but for him the stages in the sequence are connected with one another, and grows out of the preceding stage. Kholberg's view represents a more complex way of thinking about moral issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/html/kohlberg.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004152005/http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/html/kohlberg.htm |archivedate=2011-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Stages of Moral Reasoning ====

The first level of Kohlberg's moral reasoning is called [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development|preconventional morality]]. In this stage, children obey rules more externally. This means the children will conform to rules authority sets for them, to avoid punishment or to receive personal rewards. There are two stages within preconventional morality. The first is punishment and obedience orientation. In this stage, the child determines how wrong his action was according to the punishment he receives. If he does not get scolded for his bad act, he will believe he did nothing wrong. The second stage of preconventional morality is called instrumental hedonism. The main principle for this stage is “You scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours.” A person in the second stage conforms to rules for personal gain. There is a hint of understanding the ruler's perspective, although, the main objective is to gain the benefit in return.

The next level is [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development|conventional morality]]. At this level, many moral values have been internalized by the individual. He works to obey rules set by authority and to seek approval. The points of views of others are now clearly recognized and taken into serious consideration. The first stage to this level is labeled “Good boy” or “Good girl” morality. The following stage captures the golden rule “treat others the way you want to be treated.” The emphasis in this stage consists of being nice and meaning well. What is seen as “good” is now what pleases and helps others. The last stage of this level is “Authority and social order- maintaining morality.” This is conforming to set rules created by legitimate authorities that benefits society as a whole. The basis of reciprocation is growing more complex. The purpose of conforming is no longer based on the fear of punishment, but on the value people place on respecting law and doing one's duty for society.

The final level of moral reasoning is [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development|postconventional morality]]. The individual determines what the moral ideal for the society is. The individual will begin to distinguish between what is morally acceptable and what is legal. He will recognize some laws violate basic moral principles. He will go beyond perspectives of social groups or authorities and will start to accept the perspectives of all points of views around the world. In the first stage of postconventional, called “morality of contract, individual rights and democratic accepted law”, all people willingly work towards benefitting everyone. They understand all social groups within a society have different values, but believe all intellectual individuals would agree on two points. First point being freedom of liberty and life. Second, they would agree to having democratic vote for changing unfair laws and improving their society. The final stage of the final level of Kohlberg's moral reasoning is “morality of individual principles of conscience”, At this highest stage of moral reasoning, Kohlberg defines his stage 6 subjects as having a clear and broad concept of universal principles. The stage 6 thinker does not create the basis for morality. Instead, he explores, through self-evaluation, complex principles of respect for all individuals and for their rights that all religions or moral authorities would view as moral. Kohlberg stopped using stage 6 in his scoring manual, saying it was a “theoretical stage”. He began to score postconventional responses only up to stage 5.

== Moral Behavior: The Social Learning Theory ==

The Social Learning Theory is based on the observing of others and modeling behaviors, emotions and attitude of others. This theory is derived from the concept or perspective of behaviorism but has elements of cognitive learning as well. The theory says that people and especially children learn from observing others and their environment around them. It also says that imitation or modeling has a major role in learning and development of the person and their beliefs or morals. Albert Bandura was a major contributor to the theory of social learning and made many contributions to the field with social experiments and research. The social learning theory says that children learn and develop morals from observing what is around them and having role models that they imitate their behavior and learn from. Role models guide children indirectly with developing morals and morality. By watching the response of others and society around them, children learn what is acceptable and what is not acceptable and try to act similar to what is deemed acceptable by the society around them.

For example, a child's older brother or sister tends to serve as one of their first role models, especially because they share the same surroundings and authority figures. When the older child misbehaves or does something unacceptable the younger child takes the older one as an example and acts like him or her. However, if the parent punishes the older child or there is a consequence to their behavior, the younger child often does not act like the older one because they were able to observe that that behavior was “unacceptable” by the “society” surrounding them, meaning their family. This example coincides with the fact that children know that stealing, killing, and lying is bad, and honesty, kindness, and being polite is good.&lt;ref&gt;McAlister, A. J., &amp; Owen, S. V. (2006). Mechanisms of moral disengagement. Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functions of Morality: Evolutionary Theory ==

The Evolutionary Theory of Morality tries to explain morality and its development in terms of [[evolution]] and how it may at first seem contradictory for humans to have morals and morality in the evolutionary opinion. Evolution has many beliefs and parts to it but as most commonly seen, it is the survival of the fittest. This behavior is driven from the desire to pass on your genes. Whether that means being selfish or caring for your young just to make sure that your genes survive. That may seem to conflict with morality and having morals, however some argue that that may be related and having morality and morals might actually be a factor that contributes to the theory of evolution. Additionally, humans have developed communities and a social lifestyle which makes it necessary to develop morals. In an evolutionary view, a human being that acts immorally will suffer consequences, such as paying a fine, going to prison, or being an outcast. Whatever it is, there is a loss to that human. Therefore, that individual eventually learns that to be accepted in society, it is necessary to develop morals and act on them.&lt;ref&gt;Crain, W. C. (1985). Theories of development. (2nd ed., pp. 118-136). New York: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Infant ==
An infant is not held accountable for wrongdoings because an infant is considered to be amoral. Infants do not have the ability to understand morality at this stage of their life. Infancy ranges from birth to the age of two. It is during this time that infants learn how to be [[prosocial]] and empathetic by observing those around them.&lt;ref name=a /&gt;

=== Early moral training ===

An example of early moral training is given by Roger Burton. Roger Burton observed his 1-year-old daughter Ursula take her sister's Halloween candy. The older sister quickly scolded the infant for doing so. After a week had passed the infant went and stole candy again but was confronted by her mother this time. Yet again the infant stole her sister's candy, so Burton approached his daughter himself. As Burton was about to say something to Ursula, she spoke and said, “No this is Maria’s, not Ursula’s.” This specific example given by Burton shows how the infant grows and imputes morality slowly but surely.&lt;ref name=a /&gt; Over time infants start to understand that their behavior can cause repercussions. The infants learn by observing their surrounding environment. A 1 year old may cease to commit a certain action because of feelings of apprehension due to past experiences of criticism. Both disapproval and reward are key factors in furthering the infants’ development. If a baby is especially close to his mom, her disapproval and reward are that much more impactful in this process than it would be for a baby who was unattached to his mom. Infants are excellent at reading the emotions of others which in turn directs them in knowing what is good and what is bad.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Ross A. "Understanding Values in Relationship: The Development of Conscience." (n.d.): n. pag. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; A strong attachment between parent and infant is the key to having success with the infants’ socialization. If the relationship between the two is not stable by 15 months, at 4 the child will show animosity and troublesome behavior. At 5 the child is likely to show signs of destructive behavior. In order to ensure this does not happen, a mutually responsive orientation among the parent and offspring is necessary. Meaning, “A close emotionally positive and cooperative relationship in which child and care giver cares about each other and are sensitive to each other’s needs.” &lt;ref name=a /&gt; With this bond, parents can help their child's conscience grow.&lt;ref name=a /&gt;

=== Empathy and Prosocial Behavior ===

Empathy and Prosocial Behavior: Unlike what Freud, Kohlberg, and Piaget said about infants being focused solely on themselves, Krebs's has a different take on the infant. Krebs's outlook on infants is that they can and do express signs of empathy and prosocial behavior. After being born, newborns show empathy in a primitive way by showing signs of agony when hearing other babies cry. Although it is not certain whether these babies can tell the difference between their own cry and another infants, Martin Hoffman explains that between the age of 1 and 2 infants are more able to perform real moral acts. Hoffman observed a 2-year olds reaction to another child in distress. The 2 year old offered his own teddy bear to his peer. This simple act shows that the 2 year old was putting himself in the shoes of his peer &lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Martin J. "Empathy and Moral Development." Implications for Caring and Justice (2000): 12-24. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study was done by Carolyn Zahn-Waxler and her team on this topic. Waxler found that over half of the infants involved took part in at least one act of prosocial behavior &lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Nicole M. "The Development of Empathy: How, When, and Why." (n.d.): n. pag. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffman feels that as children mature empathy in turn becomes less about oneself and more about cognitive development.&lt;ref&gt;Both environment as well as genetics determines how prosocial and empathetic an individual will be.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Child ==

Kohlberg contributed to our understanding of moral development in children and said that moral reasoning is what makes ethical behavior. He said that there are six developmental stages that are constructive that eventually lead to the development of morality. Kohlberg also said that moral development does not just stop or is complete at a certain time or stage but instead that it is continuous and happens throughout a person's lifetime. Kohlberg used stories that are known as Heinz dilemmas which are controversial stories to see what people felt was morally acceptable and what was not. From that he developed his theory with his six stages of moral development which are: obedience, self-interest, conformity, law and order, human rights, and universal human ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Baron-Cohen, S. (2006). Cognition and development.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weighing Intentions ===

As mentioned before, Kohlberg believed that moral development was an ongoing thing and that through experiences it develops and adapts. Moreover, in children's moral thinking there comes a time where morality and moral decisions are made based on consequences, that is to say that they start weighing intentions in order to decide and learn whether something is morally okay or not.

An example of this can be seen in identifying the intentions of specific behaviors. We as a society also operate in that way because the same outcome or behavior can be considered acceptable had the intentions for it been good versus another time where the intentions were bad and in that case it would be unacceptable. In a situation where a child is trying to help their parent clean and misplaces something accidentally, it is easily forgiven and is considered morally acceptable because his/her intentions were good. However, if the child purposely hid the object so their parent would not find it, it is morally unacceptable because the intentions were bad. Ultimately, it is the same situation and same outcome but the intentions are different. At the age of 10–11 years children realize this concept and start justifying their actions and behaviors by weighing their intentions.

=== Understanding Rules ===

In Kohlberg's theory of moral development there are six definite stages. The first stage is called obedience and punishment orientation. And this stage is governed by the concept of having rules, laws, and things that one must follow. In children there is a set of rules set down by their authority figures, often being their parents. At this stage of moral development, morality is defined by these rules and laws that they think are set in stone and can never change. To a child, these rules are ones that can never be wrong and that define good and bad and show the difference between them. Later on however, these rules become more like guidelines and can change based on the situation they are presented in. Another aspect of these rules is the concept of punishment and reinforcement and that's how children realize what is considered morally okay or not.

An example of this is in the dilemmas used by Kolhberg, when he asked children to justify or judge the situation and their answer was always justified by something similar to “this is not fair” or “this is wrong because lying is bad” etc. This shows that at this particular stage children are not yet contributing members in terms of moral development.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, R. (2011). Moral development in childhood. Global Post: America's World News Site.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applying Theory of Mind ===

The theory of mind tells us that children need to develop a sense of self in order to develop morality and moral concepts. As the child develops, s/he needs to experience and observe in order to realize how they fit into society and eventually become part of it thereby establishing a sense of self-identity. This sense of self-identity depends on many things and it is important to develop and learn from those stages in order to fully develop understand good from bad.

=== Moral Socialization ===

Moral socialization talks about how morality is passed on. This perspective says that adults or parents pass down and teach their children the acceptable behavior through techniques and teaching as well as punishments and reinforcements. This then shows that children who learn and develop morality have good listening and are more compliant and it is because of that that they are morally developed. Therefore, if a parent fails to teach that to their child, the child then would not develop morality. Moral socialization also has studies that show that parents who use techniques that are not violent or aggressive and unconditional raise children with more conscience. Therefore, these children have more of a sense of morality and are more morally developed.&lt;ref&gt;Slavin, R. E. (2003). Educational Psychology: Theory and Practice, 7e. Boston, MA. Allyn and Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Adolescent ==

As adolescents gain the ability to independently think about complex and hypothetical ideas, and as they map out their identities, many of them begin to see their values and moral standards and some centralize on their morality. On the other side of the spectrum there are the adolescents who engage in serious antisocial behavior.

=== Changes in moral reasoning ===

The teen years are a significant period for moral growth. The moral reasoning percentage range displays that the preconventional reasoning (stage one and two) decrease rapidly as they reach teen years. During adolescence, conventional reasoning (stage three and four) become the centralized mode of moral thinking. Early year teens reflect stage 2 (instrumental hedonism) - “treat others how you would like to be treated”- or stage 3 (good boy or good girl) which involves earning approval and being polite. Almost half the percent of 16- to 18-year-olds display stage 3 reasoning and only a fifth were scored as stage 4 (authority and social order-maintaining morality) arguments. As adolescents start to age more they begin to take a broad societal perspective and act in ways to benefit the social system. The main developmental trend in moral reasoning occurs during the shift from preconventional to conventional reasoning. During the shift, individuals carry out moral standards that have been passed down by authority. Many teens characterize a moral person as caring fair, and honest. Adolescents who display these aspects tend to advance their moral reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6127751_The_self-importance_of_moral_identity/file/60b7d51ae8bf70e8b2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antisocial behavior ===

The adolescents who do not internalize society's moral standards, are more likely to be involved in antisocial conduct such as, muggings, rapes, armed robberies, etc. Most antisocial adults start their bad behavior in childhood and continue on into adolescence. Misbehavior seen in childhood increases, resulting in juvenile delinquency as adolescents. Actions such as leaving school early, having difficulty maintaining a job, and later participating in law-breaking as adults. Children who are involved in these risky activities are diagnosed as having conduct disorder and will later develop antisocial personality disorder. There are at least two outcomes of antisocial youths. First, a noticeable group of children who are involved in animal cruelty, and violence amongst their peers which then consistently progresses throughout their entire lifespan. The second group consists of the larger population of adolescents who misbehave primarily due to peer pressure but outgrow this behavior when they reach adulthood. Juveniles are most likely to depend on preconventional moral reasoning. Some offenders lack a well-developed sense of right and wrong. A majority of delinquents are able to reason conventionally but commit illegal acts anyway.&lt;ref&gt;http://psych.colorado.edu/~willcutt/pdfs/Chen_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dodge’s social information processing model ===

Kenneth Dodge progressed on the understanding of aggressive/aggression behavior with creating his social information processing model. He believed that people's retaliation to frustration, anger or provocation do not depend so much on social cues in the situation as on the ways which they process and interpret this information. An individual who is provoked goes through a six step progress of processing information. According to dodge the individual will encode and interpret cues, then clarify goals. Following this, he will respond search and decision, thinking of possible actions to achieve goal to then weigh pros and cons of alternative options. Finally, he will perform behavioral enactment, or take action. People do not go through these steps in the exact order in all cases, they may take two and work on them simultaneously or repeat the steps. Also, an individual may come up with information from not only the current situation, but also from a previous similar social experience and work off of that. The six steps in social information processing advance as one ages.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9781441906083-c1.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-855508-p173900832&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Patterson’s coercive family environments ===

Gerald Patterson observed that highly antisocial children and adolescents tend to be raised in coercive family environments in which family members try to control the others through negative, coercive tactics. The parental guidance in these households realize they are able to control their children temporarily with threatening them and providing negative reinforcement. The child also learns to use negative reinforcement to get what they want by ignoring, whining and throwing tantrums. Eventually, both sides (parents and children) lose all power of the situation and nothing is resolved. It becomes evident of how a child is raised on how they will become very hostile or present aggressiveness to resolve all their disputes. Patterson discusses how growing up in a coercive family environment creates an antisocial adolescent due to the fact they are already unpleasant to be around they begin to perform poorly in school and are rejected to all their peers. With no alternative option, they turn to the low-achieving, antisocial youths who encourage bad behavior. Dodge's theory is well supported by many cases of ineffective parenting contributing to the child's behavior problems, association with antisocial groups, resulting in antisocial behavior in adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~siegler/35patterson90.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nature and nurture ===

The next theory that may contribute to antisocial behavior is between genetic predisposition and social learning experiences. Aggression is seen more in the evolutionary aspect. An example being, males are more aggressive than females and are involved in triple the amount of crime. Aggression has been present in males for centuries due to male dependence on dominance to compete for mates and pass genes to further generations. Most individuals are born with temperaments, impulsive tendencies, and other characteristics that relate to a delinquent. Although predisposed aspects have a great effect on the adolescent's behavior, if the child grows up in a dysfunctional family and receive poor parenting or is involved in an abusive environment that will increase the chances immensely for antisocial behaviors to appear.

== The Adult==

=== Changes in Moral Reasoning ===

Lawrence Kohlberg has led most of the studies based on moral development in adults. In Kohlberg's studies, the subjects are ranked accordingly at one of the six stages. Stage 1 is called the Obedience and Punishment Orientation. Stage 1 is preconventional morality because the subject sees morality in an egocentric way. Stage 2 is also considered to be preconventional morality and is labeled as Individualism and Exchange. At this stage, the individual is still concentrated on the self and his surrounding environment. Stages 3 and 4 are at level 2, Conventional Morality. Stage 3 is called Interpersonal Relationships and is the point where the individual realizes that people should behave in good ways not only for the benefit of themselves but the family and community as well. Stage 4, Maintaining the Social Order, the individual is more concentrated on society as a whole. Stage 5 and 6 are both at level 3, post-conventional Morality. Stage 5 is the social contract and Individual Rights. At this stage people are contemplating what makes a good society rather than just what makes a society run smoothly. Stage 6, Universal Principles is the last stage which interprets the foundation of justice &lt;ref&gt;Colby et. Al., 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Kohlberg completed a 20-year study and found that most 30-year-old adults were at stage 3 and 4, the conventional level. According to this study there is still room for moral development in adulthood.

=== Kohlberg’s Theory in Perspective ===

Kohlberg's theory of moral development greatly influenced the scientific body of knowledge. That being said, it is now being evaluated and researchers are looking for a more thorough explanation of moral development. Kohlberg stated that there is no variation to his stages of development. Despite this, modern research explains that kids are more morally mature than Kohlberg had noted. On top of that, there is no strong evidence that suggests that people go from conventional to post-conventional. Lastly, it is now known that Kohlberg's theory is biased against numerous numbers of people.

=== New Approaches to Morality ===

The main focus of developmentalists now is how important emotion is in terms of morality. Developmental researchers are examining the emotions of child and adult when exhibiting good and bad behavior. The importance of innate feelings and hunches in regards to morality are also being contemplated by doctors. Researchers have also come up with dual-process models of morality. This process examines Kohlberg's rational deliberation as well as the more recent study of innate feelings and emotions. Joshua Green is one scholar who backs the dual-process models of morality and feels that there are different situations that call for each view. All in all, there are many factors that come into play in deciding whether a person will behave in a certain fashion when dealing with a moral decision.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5543">'''New realism''' was a [[philosophy]] expounded in the early 20th century by a group of six US based scholars, namely [[Edwin Holt|Edwin Bissell Holt]] ([[Harvard University]]), [[Walter Taylor Marvin]] ([[Rutgers University|Rutgers College]]), [[William Pepperell Montague]] ([[Columbia University]]), [[Ralph Barton Perry]] (Harvard), [[Walter B. Pitkin|Walter Boughton Pitkin]] (Columbia) and [[Edward Gleason Spaulding]] ([[Princeton University]]).

==Overview==
The central feature of the new realism was a rejection of the [[epistemological dualism]] of [[John Locke]] and of older forms of realism. The group maintained that, when one is conscious of, or knows, an object, it is an error to say that the object in itself and our knowledge of the object are two distinct facts. If we know a particular cow is black, is the blackness on that cow or in the observer's mind? Holt wrote: "That color out there is the thing in [[consciousness]] selected for such inclusion by the [[nervous system]]'s specific response." Consciousness is not physically identical with the [[nervous system]]: it is "out there" with the cow, all throughout the field of sight (and smell, and hearing) and identical with the set of facts it knows at any moment. The nervous system is merely a system of selection.

This position, which belongs to a broader category of views sometimes called [[neutral monism]] or, following [[William James]], [[radical empiricism]], has not worn well over the subsequent century, partly because of the problem of the nature of abstract ideas such as blackness. It seems very natural to locate blackness as an abstract idea in the mind that's useful in dealing with the world. The new realists did not want to acknowledge [[representationalism]] at all but later embraced something akin to Aristotle's form of realism: blackness is a general quality that many objects have in common, and the nervous system selects not just the object but the commonality as a fact. But [[Arthur Lovejoy]] showed in his book ''[[The Revolt Against Dualism]]'' that the perception of black varies so much, depending on context in the visual field, the perceiver's personal history and cultural usage, that it cannot be reduced to commonalities within objects.

In the framework of [[Continental philosophy|continental]] [[hermeneutics]], as a reaction against its constructivist or nihilistic outcomes, [[Maurizio Ferraris]] has proposed the so-called '''new realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (''Manifesto del nuovo realismo'', 2012), a philosophical orientation shared by both analytic philosophers (such as Mario De Caro, see Bentornata Realtà, ed. by De Caro and Ferraris, 2012), and [[continental philosopher]]s, such as [[Mauricio Beuchot]] (''Manifesto del realismo analogico'', 2013), and [[Markus Gabriel]] (''Fields of Sense: A New Realist Ontology'', 2014). In South America [[:pt:Rossano Pecoraro|Rossano Pecoraro]] (''Cenários da Filosofia contemporânea: fim da pós-modernidade e new realism?'', São Paulo, 2015; ''Cosa resta della Filosofia Contemporanea?'', Salerno-Roma, 2013) propose a political philosophy based on the Italian New Realism. (New realism intersects with other realistic continental movements that arose independently but responding to similar needs, such as the "[[speculative realism]]" defended by the French philosopher [[Quentin Meillassoux]] and the American philosopher [[Graham Harman]].)

For new realism, the assumption that science is not systematically the ultimate measure of truth and reality does not mean that we should abandon the notions of reality, truth or objectivity, as was posited by much of twentieth century philosophy. Rather, it means that philosophy, as well as jurisprudence, linguistics or history, has something important and true to say about the world. In this context, new realism presents itself primarily as a negative realism: the resistance that the outside world poses to our conceptual schemes should not be seen as a failure, but as a resource – a proof of the existence of an independent world. If this is the case, however, this negative realism turns into a positive realism: in resisting us reality does not merely set a limit we cannot trespass, but it also offers opportunities and resources. This explains how, in the natural world, different life-forms can interact in the same environment without sharing any conceptual scheme and how, in the social world, human intentions and behaviors are made possible by a reality that is first given, and that only at a later time may be interpreted and, if necessary, transformed.

The Act replaced the greater part of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], scrapping such concepts as [[actual bodily harm]] and [[grievous bodily harm]], and recognised the use of modern technology as a weapon:

:'''"force" includes...application of heat, light, electric current, noise or any other form of energy''' -Section 2.2(a)

The Act also made it an offence to use a syringe as a weapon, particularly where it is used to make the victim "...believe that he or she may become infected with disease".

'''Orbit insertion''' is the [[spaceflight]] operation of adjusting a [[spacecraft]]’s momentum, in particular to allow for entry into a stable [[orbit]] around a [[planet]], [[moon]], or other celestial body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/03oct/02144/spacecraft/orbit.htm |website=Thinkquest.org |title=Orbital Insertion |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322031028/http://library.thinkquest.org/03oct/02144/spacecraft/orbit.htm |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Orbital maneuver|maneuver]] involves either deceleration from a speed in excess of the respective body’s [[escape velocity]], or acceleration to it from a lower speed.

The result may also be a [[transfer orbit]]. There is e.g., the term ''descent orbit insertion''. Often this is called [[orbit injection]].

==Deceleration==
The first kind of orbit insertion is used when capturing into orbit around a celestial body other than Earth, owing to the excess speed of interplanetary transfer orbits relative to their destination orbits. This shedding of excess velocity is typically achieved via a [[rocket]] firing known as an orbit insertion burn. For such a maneuver, the spacecraft’s engine thrusts in its direction of travel for a specified duration to slow its velocity relative to the target body enough to enter into orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronomy.com/~/link.aspx?_id=8d44e60f-5911-4e5a-ae09-158e39ad8655 |website=Astronomy.com |title=MESSENGER poised for Mercury orbit insertion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another technique, used when the destination body has a  tangible atmosphere, is called [[aerocapture]], which can use the friction of the atmospheric drag to slow down a spacecraft enough to get into orbit. This is very risky, however, and it has never been tested for an orbit insertion. Generally the orbit insertion deceleration is performed with the main engine so that the spacecraft gets into a highly elliptical “capture orbit” and only later the apocenter can be lowered with further decelerations, or even using the atmospheric drag in a controlled way, called [[aerobraking]], to lower the apocenter and circularize the orbit while minimizing the use of onboard fuel. To date, only a handful of NASA and ESA missions have performed aerobraking ([[Magellan (spacecraft)|Magellan]], [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]], [[Trace Gas Orbiter]], [[Venus Express]], ...).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/17918/1/99-1368.pdf |website=NASA JPL |title=AEROBRAKING AT VENUS AND MARS: A COMPARISON OF THE MAGELLAN AND MARS GLOBAL SURVEYOR AEROBRAKING PHASES |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807131644/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/17918/1/99-1368.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acceleration==
The second type of orbit insertion is used for newly launched [[satellite]]s and other spacecraft. The majority of space [[launch vehicle]]s used today can only launch a payload into a very narrow range of orbits. The angle relative to the [[equator]] and maximum altitude of these orbits are constrained by the [[Spacecraft propulsion|rocket]] and [[Delta-v_budget#Launch.2Flanding|launch site]] used. Given this limitation, most payloads are first launched into a transfer orbit, where an additional thrust maneuver is required to circularize the elliptical orbit which results from the initial space launch. The key difference between this kind of maneuver and powered trans-planetary orbit insertion is the significantly lesser change in velocity required to raise or circularize an existing planetary orbit, versus canceling out the considerable velocity of interplanetary cruise.

==Alternatives to rockets==
Although current orbit insertion maneuvers require precisely timed burns of conventional chemical rockets, some headway has been made towards the use of alternative means of stabilizing orbits, such as [[ion thruster]]s or [[plasma propulsion engine]]s to achieve the same result using less fuel over a longer period of time. In addition, research into the use of electrically conducting [[space tether]]s to magnetically repel the Earth’s magnetic field has shown some promise, which would virtually eliminate the need for fuel altogether.

'''Overconsumption''' is a situation where [[resource consumption|resource use]] has outpaced the [[sustainable]] [[carrying capacity|capacity]] of the [[ecosystem]].  A prolonged pattern of overconsumption leads to [[environmental degradation]] and the eventual [[resource depletion|loss of resource]] bases.

Generally, the discussion of overconsumption parallels that of [[human overpopulation]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Ceballos|first1=Gerardo|last2=Ehrlich|first2=Paul R |last3=Dirzo|first3=Rodolfo|date=23 May 2017|title=Biological annihilation via the ongoing sixth mass extinction signaled by vertebrate population losses and declines|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/07/05/1704949114.full|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]]|volume=114|issue=30|pages=E6089–E6096|doi=10.1073/pnas.1704949114|quote=Much less frequently mentioned are, however, the ultimate drivers of those immediate causes of biotic destruction, namely, human overpopulation and continued population growth, and overconsumption, especially by the rich. These drivers, all of which trace to the fiction that perpetual growth can occur on a finite planet, are themselves increasing rapidly.|pmc=5544311|pmid=28696295}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is the more people, the more [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of [[raw material]]s takes place to sustain their lives. But, humanity's overall impact on the planet is affected by many factors besides the raw number of people. Their lifestyle (including overall affluence and resource utilization) and the pollution they generate (including [[carbon footprint]]) are equally important. Currently, the inhabitants of the [[developed nation]]s of the world consume resources at a rate almost 32 times greater than those of the developing world, who make up the majority of the human population (7.4 billion people).&lt;ref name="NYTimes_Diamond"&gt;Diamond, Jared: (2008-01-02). [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/opinion/02diamond.html "What's Your Consumption Factor?"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the developing world is a growing market of consumption. These nations are quickly gaining more purchasing power and it is expected that the Global South, which includes cities in Asia, Latin America and Africa, will account for 56% of consumption growth by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dobbs, James Manyika, Jonathan Woetzel, Jaana Remes, Jesko Perrey, Greg Kelly, Kanaka Pattabiraman, and Hemant Sharma. (2016, March). Urban world: The global consumers to watch. Retrieved November 05, 2017, from https://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/urbanization/urban-world-the-global-consumers-to-watch&lt;/ref&gt; This means that consumption rates will plateau for the developed nations and shift more into these developing countries. 

The theory of overpopulation reflects issues of [[Carrying capacity#Humans|carrying capacity]] without taking into account per capita consumption, by which developing nations are evaluated to consume more than their land can support. It is expected that world population growth will increase by 41% from 2000 to 2050, reaching a height of 8.9 billion people. On top of the rapid growth expectancy, it will be highly concentrated in the developing nations. This poses issues with inequality of consumption as well. The nations that will come into consumer dominance must abstain from abusing certain forms of consumption, especially energy consumption of CO2.&lt;ref&gt;RICHARD FLORIDA. (2016, April 14). Big Cities Are the Future of Global Consumption. Retrieved November 5, 2017, from https://www.citylab.com/life/2016/04/big-cities-are-the-future-of-global-consumption/478128/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Green party|Green parties]] and the [[ecology movement]] often argue that consumption per person, or [[ecological footprint]], is typically lower in poor than in rich nations.

==Causes==
In understanding the effects of over-consumption, it is pertinent to understand what causes the phenomenon. There is a spectrum of goods and services that the world population constantly consume. These range from food and beverage, clothing and footwear, housing, energy, technology,  transportation, education, health and personal care, financial services and other utilities.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank Group - www.worldbank.org. (n.d.). The developing world’s 4.5 billion low-income people already a $5 trillion market. Retrieved November 05, 2017, from http://datatopics.worldbank.org/consumption/market&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these require a different resource and once that resource is exploited to a certain point, that qualifies as over consumption. Since the developing nations are rising quickly into the consumer class, it is important to note the trends happening in these nations. According to the World Bank, the highest shares of consumption lie in food and beverage and clothing and footwear. This applies regardless of sector of income. &lt;ref&gt;The World Bank Group - www.worldbank.org. (n.d.). The developing world’s 4.5 billion low-income people already a $5 trillion market.

Two main factors of why we buy so much and so often is due to planned and perceived obsolescence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GorqroigqM&lt;/ref&gt; This factor of production was introduced first in the United States and it revolves around the design of products and with these methods, the products are intentionally designed to get rid of after a short amount of time. As of 2012, only 1% of goods purchased were still in use after 6 months. This is due to planned and perceived obsolescence. When it is planned, designers create products that will not be able to work after a certain amount of time but they work for enough time to ensure the customers will come back to buy again. Perceived obsolescence comes in a lot with fashion and trends and fueled by advertising and media consumption. Through this technique, consumers are convinced that certain products do not have value anymore because it is out of style, and in order to have value, consumers must buy more up to date styles. Here is where fast fashion was born. 
As of 2015, the top five consumer markets in the world included the United States, Japan, Germany, China and France. &lt;ref&gt;The 25 Largest Consumer's Markets ... And The Outlook For 2015. (n.d.).

==Effects==
{{See also|I PAT}}
A fundamental effect of overconsumption is a reduction in the planet's [[carrying capacity]]. Excessive unsustainable consumption will exceed the long term carrying capacity of its environment ([[Overshoot (ecology)|ecological overshoot]]) and subsequent resource depletion, [[environmental degradation]] and reduced [[ecosystem health]].

Looking at the two largest sectors of over consumption, the fashion and food industries, we can see most of the harmful effects on the Earth starting here. The fashion industry has created a new venue, fast fashion, which in 2013 produced 15.1 million tons of textile waste and of that, 12.8 million tons were thrown out.  The United States, being the largest consumer market, deals with excess clothing by exporting it to poorer, developing nations but this solution is not sustainable because the demand will go down as cheap clothing becomes more readily available. Another way of disposal is to throw out into landfills or burn up in incinerators which is the least sustainable disposal solution. &lt;ref&gt;Tan, Z. Y. (2016, April 10). What Happens When Fashion Becomes Fast, Disposable And Cheap? Retrieved November 05, 2017, from https://www.npr.org/2016/04/08/473513620/what-happens-when-fashion-becomes-fast-disposable-and-cheap
&lt;/ref&gt;

The food industry is the other largest sector of consumption and studies show that people waste a fifth of food products just through disposal or overconsumption. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization collected data and found that by the time food reaches the consumer, 9% (160 million tons) goes uneaten and 10% is lost to overconsumption - meaning consumers ate more than the calorie intake requirement. Other aspects of losses surrounding dry matter came at each stage in the food system, the highest amount being from livestock production at 43.9%, transportation accounted for 18% and consumer waste accounting for 12.2% loss. When the consumer takes in too much, this not only explains losses in the beginning of the stage at production (and over production) but also lends itself to overconsumption of energy and protein, having harmful effects on the body. &lt;ref&gt;Beer, E. (2017, February 27). Consumer waste and livestock biggest inefficiencies in food production: Study. Retrieved November 05, 2017, from https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2017/02/27/Consumer-waste-and-livestock-biggest-inefficiencies-in-food-production-Study
&lt;/ref&gt;


The scale of modern life's overconsumption has enabled an [[overclass]] to exist, displaying  [[affluenza]] and [[obesity]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nierenberg|first1=Danielle|title=State of the World 2006: a Worldwatch Institute report on progress toward a sustainable society|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/state-of-the-world-2006-a-worldwatch-institute-report-on-progress-toward-a-sustainable-society/oclc/62865904|website=Worldcat|publisher=New York; London: W.W. Norton|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However once again both of these claims are controversial with the latter being correlated to other factors more so than over-consumption. Within the topic of overconsumption there are many other ideas that should be considered in order to find the true cause of it. Some important events that coincide are poverty, population and the development of an area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overpopulation and overconsumption|url=https://www.bmj.com/content/306/6888/1285|website=BMJ|publisher=BMJ|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overconsumption can also lead to a decline in the economy and financial instability. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vidal|first1=John|title=World needs to stabilise population and cut consumption, says Royal Society|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/26/earth-population-consumption-disasters|website=The Guardian|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the long term, these effects can lead to increased conflict over dwindling resources &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalissues.org/EnvIssues/Population/Result.asp Effects of Over-Consumption and Increasing Populations]. 26 September 2001. Retrieved on 19 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and in the worst case a [[Malthusian catastrophe]]. [[Lester Brown]] of the [[Earth Policy Institute]], has said: "It would take 1.5 Earths to sustain our present level of consumption.  Environmentally, the world is in an overshoot mode."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Lester R. |title=World on the Edge: How to Prevent Environmental and Economic Collapse |publisher=Norton |series=Earth Policy Institute |year=2011 |page=7 |isbn =113654075X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, the United States alone was using 30% of the world’s resources and if everyone were to consume at that rate, we would need 3-5 planets to sustain this type of living. Resources are quickly becoming depleted, with about ⅓ already gone. With new consumer markets rising in the developing countries which account for a much higher percent of the world’s population, this number can only rise. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GorqroigqM&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic growth===
The [[Worldwatch Institute]] said China and India, with their booming economies, along with the United States, are the three planetary forces that are shaping the global [[biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Renner|first=Michael|title=State of the world 2005: A Worldwatch Institute Report on progress toward a sustainable society.|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/3866|accessdate=2009-09-14|date=January 2006|publisher=[[W.W. Norton]]|location=New York|isbn=0-393-32666-7|oclc=57470324|chapter=Chapter 1: China, India, and the New World Order|chapterurl=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/3992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[State of the World (book series)|State of the World]] 2005 report said the two countries' high [[economic growth]] exposed the reality of severe pollution. The report states that
&lt;blockquote&gt;The world's ecological capacity is simply insufficient to satisfy the ambitions of China, India, Japan, Europe and the United States as well as the aspirations of the rest of the world in a sustainable way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Footprint==

{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote=If everyone consumed resources at the US level, you will need another four or five Earths.|source=—[[Paul R. Ehrlich]], biologist&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/25/half-all-species-extinct-end-century-vatican-conference Biologists say half of all species could be extinct by end of century]. ''[[The Guardian]].'' February 25, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The idea of overconsumption is also strongly tied to the idea of an ecological footprint.  The term “ecological footprint” refers to the “resource accounting framework for measuring human demand on the biosphere.”  Currently, China is roughly 11 times lower in per capita footprint, yet has a population that is more than four times the size of the USA.  It is estimated that if China developed to the level of the United States that world consumption rates would roughly double.&lt;ref name="NYTimes_Diamond" /&gt;  According to Scientific American, one person from China uses 53 times fewer resources than the average American.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/american-consumption-habits/|title=American Consumption|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' postulates that meat consumption is set to increase as the result of [[human population growth]] and rising affluence, which will increase greenhouse gas emissions and further reduce [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Devlin|first=Hannah |date=July 19, 2018 |title=Rising global meat consumption 'will devastate environment'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/19/rising-global-meat-consumption-will-devastate-environment|work=The Guardian |location= |access-date=July 26, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counteractions==
The most obvious solution to the issue of overconsumption is to simply slow the rate at which materials are becoming [[Resource depletion|depleted]]. Less consumption naturally has negative effects on economies - so instead, countries must look to curb consumption rates while allowing for new industries, such as [[renewable energy]] and [[recycling]] technologies, to flourish and deflect some of the economic burden. A fundamental shift in the global economy may be necessary in order to account for the current change that is taking place or that will need to take place. Movements and lifestyle choices related to stopping overconsumption include: [[anti-consumerism]], [[freeganism]], [[green economics]], [[ecological economics]], [[degrowth]], [[frugality]], [[Downshifting (lifestyle)|downshifting]], [[simple living]], [[The Minimalists|minimalism]], and thrifting.

Recent grassroots movements have been coming up with creative ways to decrease the amount of goods we consume. [[The Freecycle Network]] is a network of people in one's community that are willing to trade goods for other goods or services. It is a new take on thrifting while still being beneficial to both parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.freecycle.org/|title=The Freecycle Network|website=www.freecycle.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Other researchers and movements such as [[the Zeitgeist Movement]] suggest a new socioeconomic model which, through a structural increase of [[efficiency]], collaboration and locality in production as well as effective [[sharing economy|sharing]], increased [[modularity]], sustainability and optimal design of products, are expected to reduce resource-consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/faq The Zeitgeist Movement - Frequently Asked Questions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815095626/http://thezeitgeistmovement.com/faq |date=2012-08-15 }} Retrieved on 6 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41872">'''Parent-Child Interaction Therapy''' ('''PCIT''') is an intervention developed by Sheila Eyberg (1988) to treat children between ages 2 and 7 with disruptive behavior problems.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1300/J019v10n01_04 |title=Parent-Child Interaction Therapy: |journal=Child &amp; Family Behavior Therapy |volume=10 |pages=33–46 |year=1988 |last1=Eyberg |first1=Sheila }}&lt;/ref&gt; PCIT is an evidence-based treatment (EBT) for young children with behavioral and emotional disorders that places emphasis on improving the quality of the parent-child relationship and changing parent-child interaction patterns.&lt;ref name="What is PCIT"&gt;{{cite web | title=What is PCIT? | website=PCIT International | url=http://www.pcit.org/what-is-pcit1.html | accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disruptive behavior is the most common reason for referral of young children for mental health services and can vary from relatively minor infractions such as talking back to significant acts of aggression. The most commonly treated Disruptive Behavior Disorders may be classified as [[Oppositional Defiant Disorder]] (ODD) or [[Conduct Disorder]] (CD), depending on the severity of the behavior and the nature of the presenting problems. The disorders often co-occur with [[Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder]] (ADHD).&lt;ref name="Zisser"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zisser |first1=A.R. |last2=Eyberg |first2=S.M. |year=2010 |chapter=Parent-child interaction therapy and the treatment of disruptive behavior disorders |editor1-first=A.E. |editor1-last=Kazdin |editor2-first=J.R. |editor2-last=Weisz |title=Evidence-based psychotherapies for children and adolescents |edition=2nd |location=New York, NY |publisher=Guilford Press }}{{pn|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a unique combination of [[behavioral therapy]], [[play therapy]], and parent training to teach more effective discipline techniques and improve the parent–child relationship.&lt;ref name="Hembree-Kigin"&gt;{{cite book |title=Parent–Child Interaction Therapy |last1=Hembree-Kigin |first1=T. |last2=McNeil |first2=C. |year=1995 |location=Springer, NY }}{{pn|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCIT is typically administered once a week, with 1-hour sessions, for 10-14 sessions total and consists of two treatment phases: Child-Directed Interaction (CDI) and Parent-Directed Interaction (PDI). The CDI component focuses on improving the quality of the parent-child relationship, which will help promote changes in behavior. This sets the foundation for the PDI stage, which continues to encourage appropriate play while also focusing on a structured and consistent approach to discipline.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

==History==
PCIT was derived from several theories, including attachment theory, social learning theory, and parenting styles theory. 

===Attachment theory===
According to [[attachment theory]] by Ainsworth,&lt;ref name=”Ainsworth”&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ainsworth |first1=M. D. S. |last2=Blehar |first2=M. C. |last3=Waters |first3=E. |last4=Wall |first4=S. N. |year=2015 |title=Patterns of attachment: A psychological study of the strange situation |publisher=Psychology Press }}{{pn|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; “sensitive and responsive parenting” during infancy and toddlerhood leads the child to develop an expectation that their needs can be met by the parent. Thus, parents who show their young children greater warmth and are more responsive and sensitive to their needs promote a sense of security that they can later apply to relationships with others. This can also help with more effective emotion regulation.&lt;ref name=”Herschell”&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1077-7229(02)80034-7 |title=Parent-child interaction therapy: New directions in research |journal=Cognitive and Behavioral Practice |volume=9 |pages=9 |year=2002 |last1=Herschell |first1=Amy D |last2=Calzada |first2=Esther J |last3=Eyberg |first3=Sheila M |last4=McNeil |first4=Cheryl B }}&lt;/ref&gt;Children who are referred to clinics for externalizing behaviors are more likely than non-referred children to display distress when separated from the parent and to display indicators of an insecure attachment to their parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Mark T. |last1=Greenberg |first2=Matthew L. |last2=Speltz |chapter=Atachment and the Ontogeny of Conduct Problems |pages=177–218 |chapterurl={{Google books|rzjvCgAAQBAJ|page=177|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-first=Jay |editor1-last=Belsky |editor2-first=Teresa M. |editor2-last=Nezworski |year=2015 |title=Clinical Implications of Attachment |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-83812-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Child Directed Interaction (CDI) component of the PCIT applies attachment theory through its goal to “restructure the parent-child relationship and provide a secure attachment for the child”. The CDI component makes use of the idea that parents can have a dramatic effect on their child's behavior, especially during the early preschool years.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt; This is a critical period where children are more responsive to their parent's and less so to other influences such as teachers or peers.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

===Social learning theory===
[[Social learning theory]] suggests that new behaviors can be learned by watching and imitating the behaviors of others.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A., &amp; Walters, R. H. (1977). Social learning theory (Vol. 1). Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-hall.{{pn|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patterson (1975)  further expands on this and proposes that child behavior problems are “inadvertently established or maintained by dysfunctional parent-child interactions”.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, G. R. (1975). Families: Application of social learning to family life. Champaign, IL: Research Press.{{pn|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=”Herschell” /&gt; There can be a “coercive interaction cycle” between parent and child where both try to control the behavior of the other. Behaviors such as arguing and aggression in children are reinforced by parent behaviors (e.g., withdrawal of demands), but negative parent behaviors can subsequently be reinforced by negative child behaviors.&lt;ref name=”Herschell” /&gt; In sum, children can learn many behaviors from their parents’ feedback, but this can result in negative externalizing behaviors, as well. The PDI component targets this cycle specifically by establishing consistent parenting behaviors that encourage the desired behavior in children. 

===Parenting style theory===
According to [[Diana Baumrind]]’s parenting style theory (year link citation) found that the authoritative parenting style leads to the healthiest outcomes for children transitioning into adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=6032134 |year=1967 |author1=Baumrind |first1=D |title=Child care practices anteceding three patterns of preschool behavior |journal=Genetic psychology monographs |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=43–88 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This style combines responsive and nurturing interactions with clear communication and firm discipline. The influence of this theory can be seen particularly in the PDI treatment phase where parents are taught to use direct commands to increase desired behavior, along with other positive and nurturing behaviors.&lt;ref name=”Herschell” /&gt;

==Structure of the PCIT==
Eyberg’s original paper (1988) thoroughly describes each assessment and treatment phase of the PCIT and includes suggestions for applying the therapy.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

First, parents attend a training session during which the therapist explains each rule and its rationale. Each parent is also taught through one-on-one role play interactions with the therapist. Parents are also given a handout at the end of the session that summarizes the basic directions so they can review it at home.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

After this training session, the sessions that follow will include the child. The sessions are held in a playroom, with the child playing with one parent at a time. Meanwhile, the therapist and the other parent will be observing the play through a one-way mirror or video system. The therapist can provide immediate feedback and suggestions through a “bug-in-ear” device or sit in the room to do the coaching. At the end of the session, the therapist discusses the child's progress, using summary sheets that parents can use to guide their interactions during practice sessions at home. These practice sessions serve as a “homework assignment” for parents, during which they practice the interaction with their child for five minutes a day, using homework sheets to track progress. The treatment begins with the Child-Directed Interaction phase, then is followed by the Parent-Directed Interaction (PDI) phase.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

===Child-Directed Interaction (CDI)===
According to Eyberg (1988), the parent's goal during this stage is to follow the child's lead during play while being sure to follow the “Don’t Rules” and “Do Rules of CDI”. The child should be free to lead the activity and make their own decisions about what and how to play. By letting their children take control of the play, the parents help their child develop autonomy and independence.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

====Don’t rules of CDI====
According to Eyberg (1988), the Don’t rules help parents step back and encourage child-led play by avoiding commands, questions, and criticisms. Commands, or instructions, would take the lead away from the child could also introduce potential disagreements into the play. Parents are also encouraged to not ask questions. This can include questions such as “How about putting the toys away?” which are actually implied commands. The concern about asking questions is that they may come off as accusatory (“Why did you choose that toy?”) or take the conversation to an “adult” level instead of letting the child play freely and naturally. The general idea is that questions provide little information, so they have limited usefulness in therapy. The third “don’t” rule is to avoid criticizing. Though criticisms can range from mild to blatant attacks on the child, criticisms in general can lead to damaging effects on the child's self-esteem. As children learn which behaviors are good or bad, they rely on what their parents say about them and believe it. Criticisms may also frustrate or anger the child and can lead to a counterattack. Taken together, criticisms are not only unproductive in therapy, but also are threats to the positive relationship that the PCIT emphasizes.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

====Do rules of CDI====
According to Eyberg (1988), the Do rules of CDI that promote positive behavior throughout play. The first Do is to describe what the child is doing during the activity. Doing this may seem unnatural at first, but describing serves a few purposes:  it allows the child to (1) lead play, (2) improve attention towards independent activities, (3) clarify the activity and encourage the child to further elaborate the play, and (4) help teach the child different concepts in a positive way. For example, the child learns through positive feedback (“you found the red one”) instead of coercion (“find the red one”).&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

The second Do is imitation. Eyberg recommends that the parents “sit close and do the same thing as the child”. The parent can add to the child's play, or do something similar, but the focus should still remain on the child's style of play. The attention that imitation can demonstrate can show the child that the parent is interested and believes what they are doing is important. Imitation may even lead to the child imitating the parent. The aim is that through the parent-child play, the child can learn cooperative play skills that they can one day use with other children.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

Parents are encouraged to reflect what the child says during play, the third Do of CDI. This helps parents practice listening to their child. For example, when the child says “The car is fast,” the parent might say “Yes, the car is fast”. These reflections show that the parent understands and accepts what the child is saying. Additionally, using reflective statements can improve the child's vocabulary and grammar by providing clarity to the child's thoughts. It also gives the child an opportunity to agree or disagree with the parent's understanding and elaborate if needed.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

Praise is the fourth Do, and is very important because it can make children feel good and increase warmth, an important goal of the CDI. Praise statements such as “Good job!” show the child that their creations and actions are important. This is important because children tend to believe the things parents say to them, whether they be positive or negative. The manual specifies two types of praise. “Labeled praise” statements specify exactly what the parent likes about their behavior. For example, saying “You did a beautiful job of drawing that picture” not only teaches children that they did something the parent liked, but also teaches them what they did to earn that praise.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;Because PCIT can be used from ages 2 through 7, coaching takes into account the developmental differences at each age and teaches parents to be mindful of those differences. Parents are encouraged to praise and reflect all attempts of their child to verbally communicate, as speech skills are concurrently developing.&lt;ref name=”Herschell” /&gt;

===Parent-Directed Interaction (PDI)===
According to Eyberg (1988), during the PDI component, parents continue the skills learned in the CDI, but this time they are taught new skills to lead the play. These skills include giving verbal directions and applying the appropriate consequences to the child in a fair manner that the child can understand clearly. These steps are practiced at the clinic, and parents are not encouraged to practice at home until they feel confident.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

Eyberg (1988) states that he first step is to give clear, direct commands for the desired behavior from the child and to avoid indirect commands, which can be too vague and confusing to the child. For example, “Put this red table in the house” is a direct command. However, an indirect command such as “Will you color the leaves green?” can be interpreted by the child as a genuine question. Another example of an indirect command is “Let’s clean up the toys”, which does not indicate clearly if both the parent and child will be doing the task or how much of the task the child will do themselves. Additionally, phrases that are too general, such as “Be good”, should be avoided, as it does not provide enough information about what exactly is expected of the child. In sum, clear statements should be used towards the child so they can understand easily without getting confused.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

Eyberg (1988) provides some guidelines for parents to teach parents when giving direct commands. First, the commands should be stated positively and should tell the child what to do, rather than what not to do. For example, “Put your hands in your lap” should be used instead of “Stop grabbing the toys”. Secondly, the command should be one that is age-appropriate for the child. For example, telling a 2-year-old “Tie your shoe” would be considered not age-appropriate. Lastly, the command should require only one behavior at a time. This way, children need not remember long strings of orders in a single command.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

The second step of PDI involves labeled praise when the child displays the desired behavior. For example, “I like it when you do what I tell you to do so quickly!” tells the child what specific action pleased the parent and this praise will help increase that desired behavior.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

The third step is to initiate time-out whenever the child is noncompliance. Eyberg states that noncompliance will be reinforced by both parental attention and when the child is able to get out of something they do not want to do. An example may be a warning followed by a three-minute time-out.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

Eventually, as these skills are mastered by the parent, the commands can begin to address relevant behavioral problems the child may be displaying. The approach depends on the treatment goal. For example, if the goal is to increase a certain desired behavior, the parent must break the skill down into simpler parts that can be built on through practice and labeled praise until the child masters it.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;

==Assessments==
===Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction System (DPICS)===
DPICS is an observational system originally created for conduct problem families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.49.2.245 |pmid=7217491 |title=The dyadic parent–child interaction coding system: Standardization and validation |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=245–50 |year=1981 |last1=Robinson |first1=Elizabeth A |last2=Eyberg |first2=Sheila M }}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses direct observations of behaviors to assess parent-child interactions. DPICS has undergone two revisions since its first edition published in 1981. The DPICS categories serve as indicators of relationship quality, measured by verbal and physical behaviors during social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Eyberg, S. M., Nelson, M. M., Duke, M., &amp; Boggs, S. R. (2004). Manual for the Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System Third Edition.{{pn|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of parent behavior categories are direct and indirect commands, behavior descriptions, reflective statements, praise, information descriptions, questions, and negative talk. Child behavior categories include compliance and noncompliance, physical positive and negative, yell, whine, smart talk, laugh, and destructive behavior.&lt;ref name="”Herschell”" /&gt;

===Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI)===
The ECBI is a 36-item behavior scale that is used to track disruptive behaviors in children. It was constructed from data indicating the most typical problem behaviors reported by parents of conduct problem children. The measure includes two scales: Intensity and Problem. Parents report Intensity by rating how frequent each item occurs. The Problem scale asks parents “Is this behavioral  problem for you?” to which parents respond “yes” or “no”. This measure can be used for children aged 2 to 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/15374417809532835 |title=Assessment of child behavior problems: The validation of a new inventory |journal=Journal of Clinical Child Psychology |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=113 |year=2009 |last1=Eyberg |first1=Sheila M |last2=Ross |first2=Arthur W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===Behavior problems===
Disruptive behavior problems are the leading reason for children's referrals to mental health professionals.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10566-016-9350-5 |title=Parent–Child Interaction Therapy for Child Disruptive Behaviour Disorders: A Meta-analysis |journal=Child &amp; Youth Care Forum |volume=45 |issue=5 |pages=675 |year=2016 |last1=Ward |first1=Michelle A |last2=Theule |first2=Jennifer |last3=Cheung |first3=Kristene }}&lt;/ref&gt; and PCIT was first created to target these behaviors.&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt; Results from a randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of PCIT on clinic referred children with diagnoses of [[Oppositional Defiant Disorder]] indicated that compared to the waitlist control group, parents interacted more positively with their children and were more successful at gaining compliance.&lt;ref name="Schuhmann"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15374424jccp2701_4 |pmid=9561935 |title=Efficacy of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy: Interim Report of a Randomized Trial with Short-Term Maintenance |journal=Journal of Clinical Child Psychology |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=34–45 |year=1998 |last1=Schuhmann |first1=Elena M |last2=Foote |first2=Rebecca C |last3=Eyberg |first3=Sheila M |last4=Boggs |first4=Stephen R |last5=Algina |first5=James }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, parents in the treatment group reported decreased parenting stress and more control. Parents also reported significant improvements in their child's behavior following treatment.&lt;ref name="Schuhmann" /&gt;

Similar results have been shown in a quasi-experimental study by Boggs and colleagues (2004) that evaluated families who completed the treatment program compared to families who dropped out of the study before completion. For those who completed treatment, parents reported positive changes 10-30 months following treatment in their child's behavior and their parenting stress. Those who dropped out of treatment early did not show significant changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1300/J019v26n04_01 |title=Outcomes of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy: A Comparison of Treatment Completers and Study Dropouts One to Three Years Later |journal=Child &amp; Family Behavior Therapy |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=1 |year=2005 |last1=Boggs |first1=Stephen R |last2=Eyberg |first2=Sheila M |last3=Edwards |first3=Daniel L |last4=Rayfield |first4=Arista |last5=Jacobs |first5=Jenifer |last6=Bagner |first6=Daniel |last7=Hood |first7=Korey K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a meta-analysis that conducted a comprehensive review of PCIT's efficacy with children diagnosed with ADHD, ODD, or CD, PCIT was found to be an “efficacious intervention for improving externalizing behavior in children with disruptive behavior disorders”.&lt;ref name="Ward" /&gt; Another meta-analysis that focused on parenting stress in addition to child behaviors as outcomes found PCIT to have a “beneficial impact on parents’ and primary caregivers’ perceptions of all outcomes examined, including child externalizing behaviors, child's temperament and self-regulatory abilities, frequency of behavior problems, the difficulty of parent-child interactions, and parent overall distress”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10522158.2014.888696 |title=Parent–Child Interaction Therapy: A Meta-Analysis of Child Behavior Outcomes and Parent Stress |journal=Journal of Family Social Work |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=191 |year=2014 |last1=Cooley |first1=Morgan E |last2=Veldorale-Griffin |first2=Amanda |last3=Petren |first3=Raymond E |last4=Mullis |first4=Ann K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment effects of PCIT can also be demonstrated in school settings, despite the treatment program being lab- or home-based.&lt;ref name="Funderburk 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1300/J019v20n02_02 |title=Parent-Child Interaction Therapy with Behavior Problem Children: Maintenance of Treatment Effects in the School Setting |journal=Child &amp; Family Behavior Therapy |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=17 |year=2009 |last1=Funderburk |first1=Beverly W |last2=Eyberg |first2=Sheila M |last3=Newcomb |first3=Katharine |last4=McNeil |first4=Cheryl B |last5=Hembree-Kigin |first5=Toni |last6=Capage |first6=Laura }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study by Funderburk and colleagues (2009), school assessments were administered at 12 months and 18 months following PCIT. At 12 months, results indicated that children in the treatment group maintained their post-treatment improvements, improving within “normal range of conduct problems” compared to the control group. However, though maintaining improvements with compliance, the 18-month followup indicated some declines into the range of levels before treatment.&lt;ref name="Funderburk 2009" /&gt;

===Child maltreatment===
Studies have examined the effectiveness of PCIT with families at risk or engaged in [[child maltreatment]]. Evidence suggests that factors such as coercive patterns of parent-child interactions, less sensitivity towards the child, and insecure child attachment can be risks for child maltreatmen.t&lt;ref name="Thomas 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1077559512459555 |pmid=22942167 |title=Parent–Child Interaction Therapy |journal=Child Maltreatment |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=253–66 |year=2012 |last1=Thomas |first1=Rae |last2=Zimmer-Gembeck |first2=Melanie J }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a randomized controlled trial composing of 12-session PCIT, mothers reported less internalizing and externalizing behaviors in children in the PCIT group.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2012" /&gt; Additionally, mothers reported less stress, more positive verbalizations and maternal sensitivity.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01548.x |pmid=21291436 |title=Accumulating Evidence for Parent-Child Interaction Therapy in the Prevention of Child Maltreatment |journal=Child Development |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=177–92 |year=2011 |last1=Thomas |first1=Rae |last2=Zimmer-Gembeck |first2=Melanie J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have found similar results, including a reduction of abuse risk post-treatment compared to the waitlist control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10578-011-0226-5 |title=The Effectiveness of Parent–Child Interaction Therapy with Depressive Mothers: The Changing Relationship as the Agent of Individual Change |journal=Child Psychiatry &amp; Human Development |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=406 |year=2011 |last1=Timmer |first1=Susan G |last2=Ho |first2=Lareina K. L |last3=Urquiza |first3=Anthony J |last4=Zebell |first4=Nancy M |last5=Fernandez y Garcia |first5=Erik |last6=Boys |first6=Deanna }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas 2011" /&gt;

====Foster care====
PCIT may also be an effective intervention for maltreated children in foster care settings. Because children with behavioral problems in foster care are more likely to have multiple foster care placements and mental health problems, the interventions that improve foster parents’ skills in managing children's difficult behaviors are needed. Findings from a study comparing foster parents and their foster children to non-abusive biological parents and their children demonstrated PCIT's effectiveness in reducing child behavior problems and caregiver distress following treatment for both groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2005.01.006 |title=Challenging foster caregiver–maltreated child relationships: The effectiveness of parent–child interaction therapy |journal=Children and Youth Services Review |volume=28 |pages=1 |year=2006 |last1=Timmer |first1=Susan G |last2=Urquiza |first2=Anthony J |last3=Zebell |first3=Nancy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PCIT has been adapted to treat [[major depressive disorder]] in preschool-aged children, called the PCIT-ED.&lt;ref name="Lenze"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/da.20770 |pmid=21284068 |pmc=3302425 |title=Parent-child interaction therapy emotion development: A novel treatment for depression in preschool children |journal=Depression and Anxiety |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=153–9 |year=2011 |last1=Lenze |first1=Shannon N |last2=Pautsch |first2=Jennifer |last3=Luby |first3=Joan }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emotional Development module (ED) was added to target emotion development impairments in very young children, specifically.&lt;ref name="Lenze" /&gt; Its goal is to help children regulate and understand their own emotions more effectively. The two phases of PCIT, CDI and PDI, are retained, but are shortened to six session per phase. Parents are taught skills that help their child in identifying and managing their emotions. For example, this may involve recognizing the child's “triggers” and using relaxation techniques to calm them. Often, parents may try to stop the child's expression of negative emotion, but during ED, parents are taught to tolerate these negative emotions so their child can learn to regulate them.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

The pilot study of the PCIT-ED was an open trial study that examined a group of preschool children with depression, assessing symptoms before and after treatment.  This study showed decreased depressive symptoms in children, and most children no longer met [[major depressive disorder]] criteria upon completion of treatment. Additionally, children improved their coping skills, prosocial behaviors, and thought processes.&lt;ref name="Lenze" /&gt; The first randomized controlled trial that compared PCIT-ED to psychoeducation in depressed preschoolers and their caregivers also showed significant improvement two weeks posttreatment for the PCIT-ED group in emotion development, child executive functioning, and parenting stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2011.02483.x |pmid=22040016 |pmc=3640820 |title=A novel early intervention for preschool depression: Findings from a pilot randomized controlled trial |journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=313–22 |year=2012 |last1=Luby |first1=Joan |last2=Lenze |first2=Shannon |last3=Tillman |first3=Rebecca }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separation anxiety disorder===
[[Separation anxiety disorder]] (SAD) is the most common [[anxiety]] disorder in children which is characterized by an “excessive fear response to real or imagined separation from a caregiver”.&lt;ref name="Pincus"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cbpra.2007.08.002 |title=The Implementation of Modified Parent-Child Interaction Therapy for Youth with Separation Anxiety Disorder |journal=Cognitive and Behavioral Practice |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=118 |year=2008 |last1=Pincus |first1=Donna B |last2=Santucci |first2=Lauren C |last3=Ehrenreich |first3=Jill T |last4=Eyberg |first4=Sheila M }}&lt;/ref&gt; PCIT involves many parenting skills that are important in reducing children's anxiety, such as command training, selective attention, reinforcement, and shaping the child's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1077-7229(05)80047-1 |title=Parent-child interaction therapy for treatment of separation anxiety disorder in young children: A pilot study |journal=Cognitive and Behavioral Practice |volume=12 |pages=126 |year=2005 |last1=Choate |first1=Molly L |last2=Pincus |first2=Donna B |last3=Eyberg |first3=Sheila M |last4=Barlow |first4=David H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilot study results by Pincus and colleagues (2008) evaluating the efficacy of PCIT in 10 young children with SAD showed that did not improve to nonclinical levels posttreatment, however there was improvement in the severity of SAD.&lt;ref name="Pincus" /&gt; Pincus and colleagues (2008) also proposed an adaptation to the PCIT that would include the Bravery-Directed Interaction (BDI) phase.&lt;ref name="Pincus" /&gt; The BDI phase includes a psychoeducational component for the parents about anxiety. It also includes a gradual exposure to the separation situations the child fears. This exposure is key for all anxiety disorders. The BDI focuses on establishing a sense of control in the child by giving them the freedom to choose one exposure activity a week from the “Bravery Ladder” homework assignment, rather than having their parent choose. An initial randomized controlled trial has been conducted to evaluate the modified PCIT, comparing its efficacy to a waitlist control group. It seeks to assess the maintenance of change at 3, 6, and 12 months posttreatment. Preliminary results of study show decreased severity of SAD post-treatment.&lt;ref name="Pincus" /&gt;

===Domestic and interparental violence exposure===
Children are at an especially high risk for externalizing and internalizing problems following interparental violence-exposure or [[domestic violence]]. Borrego and colleagues (2008) have provided rationale for the use of PCIT with domestic violence-exposed women and their children, proposing that the parent training component may be very beneficial for mothers who may have “low levels of confidence in their own parenting capabilities and may also have low self-esteem”.&lt;ref name="Borrego"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10896-008-9177-4 |title=Parent–Child Interaction Therapy with Domestic Violence Populations |journal=Journal of Family Violence |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=495 |year=2008 |last1=Borrego |first1=Joaquin |last2=Gutow |first2=Mindy R |last3=Reicher |first3=Shira |last4=Barker |first4=Chikira H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Borrego and colleagues (2008) emphasized that because PCIT is relationship-based, it may improve the quality of the mother-child relationship, developing a secure attachment between mother and child, and may lead to a decrease in the severity of trauma symptoms experienced by both.&lt;ref name="Borrego" /&gt;

One study by Timmer and colleagues (2010) compared the effectiveness of PCIT in reducing behavior problems in maltreated children exposed to interparental violence (IPV) and similar children with no history of IPV-exposure. Results indicated that there were decreases in behavior problems and caregivers’ distress from pre- to posttreatment in both the IPV-exposed and non-exposed groups. However, there was no significant difference between variations of IPV exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1891/0886-6708.25.4.486 |pmid=20712147 |title=The Effectiveness of Parent–Child Interaction Therapy for Victims of Interparental Violence |journal=Violence and Victims |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=486–503 |year=2010 |last1=Timmer |first1=Susan G |last2=Ware |first2=Lisa M |last3=Urquiza |first3=Anthony J |last4=Zebell |first4=Nancy M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Delivery of treatment==
===In-home===
The implementation of PCIT in the home has been examined in order to increase accessibility. Protocol was followed as closely as possible, with the exception that treatment was conducted within the home. Some modifications may be necessary in this setting. For example, the bug-in-ear (a small, wireless earpiece) was used for coaching parents could not be used. Instead, therapists were present in the same room for coaching, typically behind the caregiver, giving discrete feedback.&lt;ref name="Ware"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/07317100802060302 |title=Efficacy of In-Home Parent-Child Interaction Therapy |journal=Child &amp; Family Behavior Therapy |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=99 |year=2008 |last1=Ware |first1=Lisa M |last2=McNeil |first2=Cheryl B |last3=Masse |first3=Joshua |last4=Stevens |first4=Sarah }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therapists were able to conduct DPICS observations, however these observations were coded live.

The in-home administration of PCIT in a single-subject study by Ware and colleagues (2012) has yielded promising results, such as decrease in caregiver use of negative behavior and increase in use of positive behavior and praise posttreatment.&lt;ref name="Ware" /&gt; PCIT has also shown to improve child outcomes as well. PCIT completers were found to have significantly lower risk of child abuse compared to noncompleters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/07317107.2012.707079 |title=Effectiveness of Parent–Child Interaction Therapy Delivered to At-Risk Families in the Home Setting |journal=Child &amp; Family Behavior Therapy |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=177 |year=2012 |last1=Galanter |first1=Rachel |last2=Self-Brown |first2=Shannon |last3=Valente |first3=Jessica R |last4=Dorsey |first4=Shannon |last5=Whitaker |first5=Daniel J |last6=Bertuglia-Haley |first6=Michelle |last7=Prieto |first7=Metta }}&lt;/ref&gt; decrease in child behavior problems, and increased child compliance posttreatment.&lt;ref name="Ware" /&gt;

There are certain advantages that come with in-home PCIT. For example, therapists are able to take advantage of more authentic, “real life” behaviors that may not be accurately captured within a laboratory or clinic setting. Additionally, in-home PCIT can combat attrition, a problem commonly faced by therapists.&lt;ref name="Masse"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/07317100802060310 |title=In-Home Parent-Child Interaction Therapy: Clinical Considerations |journal=Child &amp; Family Behavior Therapy |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=127 |year=2008 |last1=Masse |first1=Joshua J |last2=McNeil |first2=Cheryl B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach has potential drawbacks, as well. For example, because homes vary greatly across families, it is much more difficult for therapists control, unlike a laboratory or clinic setting. It may also be more difficult to keep children within the room and within the therapist's sight, as the child has more freedom to “escape” if needed.&lt;ref name="Masse" /&gt; These problems can be avoided by deciding beforehand which room the therapy will take place and by minimizing potential distractions. Availability of resources can be an issue as well, particularly when the treatment requires use of age-appropriate toys that are typically controlled by the therapist in clinical settings. In homes, there may be limited options of activities. However, talking to the parent beforehand about what they might prefer to play with may be helpful, and the therapist can plan to bring the toys needed.&lt;ref name="Masse" /&gt;

===Community-based===
PCIT implemented in the community involves administration in community settings such as in the home, mental health services agencies, or family services agencies. Few studies have examined the effectiveness of PCIT in community settings, however one implementation through community agencies has shown decreases in behavior problems, improved parent-child interactions, reduced parental stress in a four-family clinical case study posttreatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cbpra.2010.12.002 |title=Delivering Parent-Child Interaction Therapy in an Urban Community Clinic |journal=Cognitive and Behavioral Practice |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=502 |year=2011 |last1=Budd |first1=Karen S |last2=Hella |first2=Bryce |last3=Bae |first3=Hyo |last4=Meyerson |first4=David A |last5=Watkin |first5=Sarah C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a study by Lanier and colleagues (2014) found PCIT to be effective for maltreatment prevention in a group of families receiving PCIT at posttreatment followup.&lt;ref name="Lanier"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10826-012-9708-8 |pmid=24443637 |pmc=3891779 |title=Preventing Maltreatment with a Community-Based Implementation of Parent–Child Interaction Therapy |journal=Journal of Child and Family Studies |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=449–460 |year=2012 |last1=Lanier |first1=Paul |last2=Kohl |first2=Patricia L |last3=Benz |first3=Joan |last4=Swinger |first4=Dawn |last5=Drake |first5=Brett }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet-based===
In an effort to increase accessibility and address obstacles of receiving treatment, especially in underserved communities, an internet-based delivery of PCIT has been proposed and tested. This method uses video conferencing, webcams, and wireless earpieces, allowing for therapists to continue to provide real-time feedback to caregivers, right from the comfort of their home.&lt;ref name="Comer"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cbpra.2014.07.003 |pmid=26120268 |pmc=4480784 |title=Rationale and Considerations for the Internet-Based Delivery of Parent–Child Interaction Therapy |journal=Cognitive and Behavioral Practice |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=302–316 |year=2015 |last1=Comer |first1=Jonathan S |last2=Furr |first2=Jami M |last3=Cooper-Vince |first3=Christine |last4=Madigan |first4=Ryan J |last5=Chow |first5=Candice |last6=Chan |first6=Priscilla T |last7=Idrobo |first7=Fabio |last8=Chase |first8=Rhea M |last9=McNeil |first9=Cheryl B |last10=Eyberg |first10=Sheila M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advantages of this method include the ability to generalize findings better because families were treated in natural settings, which are the settings in which child disruptive behaviors are most likely to manifest.

Availability of resources can pose as a problem when implementing this method of PCIT. Success is dependent on families owning, or being provided, microphones, ear pieces, webcams, computers, and Wi-Fi hotspots. In homes that lack Wi-Fi or have suboptimal internet connections, real-time feedback from therapists may be affected. Treatment providers may be able to provide the necessary equipment for families to borrow, however this depends heavily on the availability of grant funds.&lt;ref name="Comer" /&gt;

A randomized trial has been conducted with the Internet-Delivered Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (I-PCIT) and has shown support for its effectiveness in treating children with disruptive behavior disorders. Parents perceived less barriers to treatment when compared to those receiving clinic-based PCIT.&lt;ref name="Comer" /&gt; This study demonstrated decreases in children's symptoms and burden to parents in a randomized clinical trial compared to a waitlist control group, and to traditional in-office PCIT administration.&lt;ref name="Comer" /&gt; Additionally, roughly half of the children in the study no longer met the diagnostic criteria for [[disruptive behavior disorder]].&lt;ref name="Comer" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
In addition to the time-out component, Eyberg (1988) also recommended swatting child's bottom and other physical punishment as a form of discipline&lt;ref name="Eyberg Original" /&gt;, however in a study by Timmer and colleagues (2005), physical punishment was not found to be necessary&lt;ref name="Timmer"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2005.01.003 |title=Parent-Child Interaction Therapy: Application to maltreating parent-child dyads |journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect |volume=29 |issue=7 |pages=825 |year=2005 |last1=Timmer |first1=Susan G |last2=Urquiza |first2=Anthony J |last3=Zebell |first3=Nancy M |last4=McGrath |first4=Jean M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since been removed from the PCIT protocol. Timmer (2005) further suggested that it did not add anything and suggested a more hands-off approach to parenting.&lt;ref name="Timmer" /&gt;

Attrition rates among families receiving PCIT are an ongoing concern.&lt;ref name="Lanier" /&gt; In a meta-analysis by Thomas and Zimmer-Gembeck (2012), attrition rates ranged from 18 to 35% among studies that reported attrition.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2011" /&gt;

[[File:C Hello World Program.png|thumb|right|402px|The [[source code]] for a simple computer program written in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]]. When [[compiled]] and run, it would give the output "[["Hello, World!" program|Hello, world!]]".]]
A '''programming language''' is a [[formal language]], which comprises a [[Instruction set|set of instructions]] used to produce various kinds of [[Input/output|output]]. Programming languages are used in [[computer programming]] to create [[program (machine)|programs]] that implement specific [[algorithm]]s.

Most programming languages consist of [[Machine instruction|instructions]] for [[computer]]s, although there are programmable machines that use a limited set of [[domain-specific language|specific instructions]], rather than the [[General-purpose language|general programming languages]] of modern computers. Early ones preceded the [[History of computing hardware|invention of the digital computer]], the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by the [[Banū Mūsā|brothers Musa]] in [[Baghdad]], during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Koetsier | first = Teun | title = On the prehistory of programmable machines; musical automata, looms, calculators | publisher = PERGAMON, Mechanism and Machine Theory 36 | year = 2001 | pages = 589–603}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the early 1800s, programs were used to direct the behavior of machines such as [[Jacquard loom]]s, [[music box]]es and [[player piano]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger, James (2004) ''Jacquard's Web'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, their programs (such as a player piano's scrolls) could not produce different behavior in response to some input or condition.

Thousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computer field, and many more still are being created every year. Many programming languages require computation to be specified in an [[imperative programming|imperative]] form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use other forms of program specification such as the [[declarative programming|declarative]] form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).

The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] (form) and [[semantics]] (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the [[C (programming language)|C]] programming language is specified by an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] Standard) while other languages (such as [[Perl]]) have a dominant [[Programming language implementation|implementation]] that is treated as a [[reference implementation|reference]]. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.

==Definitions==
A programming language is a notation for writing [[computer program|programs]], which are specifications of a computation or [[algorithm]].&lt;ref name="Aaby 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aaby|first=Anthony|title=Introduction to Programming Languages|year=2004|url=http://www.emu.edu.tr/aelci/Courses/D-318/D-318-Files/plbook/intro.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108043216/http://www.emu.edu.tr/aelci/Courses/D-318/D-318-Files/plbook/intro.htm|archivedate=8 November 2012|df=dmy-all|access-date=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, but not all, authors restrict the term "programming language" to those languages that can express ''all'' possible algorithms.&lt;ref name="Aaby 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In mathematical terms, this means the programming language is [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]] {{cite book|last=MacLennan|first=Bruce J.|title=Principles of Programming Languages|page=1|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1987|isbn=0-19-511306-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traits often considered important for what constitutes a programming language include:

; Function and target
: A ''computer programming language'' is a [[formal language|language]] used to write [[computer program]]s, which involves a [[computer]] performing some kind of computation&lt;ref name=sigplan&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] SIGPLAN|title=Bylaws of the Special Interest Group on Programming Languages of the Association for Computing Machinery|url=http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/sigplan_bylaws.htm|accessdate=19 June 2006|year=2003|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622110145/http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/sigplan_bylaws.htm|archivedate=22 June 2006|df=dmy-all}}, ''The scope of SIGPLAN is the theory, design, implementation, description, and application of computer programming languages - languages that permit the specification of a variety of different computations, thereby providing the user with significant control (immediate or delayed) over the computer's operation.''&lt;/ref&gt; or [[algorithm]] and possibly control external devices such as [[printer (computing)|printers]], [[disk drive]]s, [[robot]]s,&lt;ref name="robots"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/tld/courses/cs148/02/programming.html |title=Programming Robots |accessdate=23 September 2006 |last=Dean |first=Tom |year=2002 |work=Building Intelligent Robots |publisher=Brown University Department of Computer Science |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029045949/http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/tld/courses/cs148/02/programming.html |archivedate=29 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and so on. For example, [[PostScript]] programs are frequently created by another program to control a computer printer or display. More generally, a programming language may describe computation on some, possibly abstract, machine. It is generally accepted that a complete specification for a programming language includes a description, possibly idealized, of a machine or processor for that language.&lt;ref name=nara2&gt;R. Narasimahan, Programming Languages and Computers: A Unified Metatheory, pp. 189--247 in Franz Alt, Morris Rubinoff (eds.) Advances in computers, Volume 8, Academic Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-12-012108-5}}, p.193 : "a complete specification of a programming language must, by definition, include a specification of a processor--idealized, if you will--for that language." [the source cites many references to support this statement]&lt;/ref&gt; In most practical contexts, a programming language involves a computer; consequently, programming languages are usually defined and studied this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ben Ari|first=Mordechai|title=Understanding Programming Languages|publisher=John Wiley and Sons| year=1996|quote=Programs and languages can be defined as purely formal mathematical objects. However, more people are interested in programs than in other mathematical objects such as groups, precisely because it is possible to use the program—the sequence of symbols—to control the execution of a computer. While we highly recommend the study of the theory of programming, this text will generally limit itself to the study of programs as they are executed on a computer.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programming languages differ from [[natural language]]s in that natural languages are only used for interaction between people, while programming languages also allow humans to communicate instructions to machines.
; Abstractions
: Programming languages usually contain [[abstraction (computer science)|abstractions]] for defining and manipulating [[data structure]]s or controlling the [[control flow|flow of execution]]. The practical necessity that a programming language support adequate abstractions is expressed by the [[abstraction principle (programming)|abstraction principle]];&lt;ref&gt;David A. Schmidt, ''The structure of typed programming languages'', MIT Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-262-19349-3}}, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; this principle is sometimes formulated as a recommendation to the programmer to make proper use of such abstractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pierce|first=Benjamin|title=Types and Programming Languages|publisher=MIT Press|year=2002|isbn=0-262-16209-1|page=339}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Expressive power
: The [[theory of computation]] classifies languages by the computations they are capable of expressing. All [[Turing completeness|Turing complete]] languages can implement the same set of [[algorithm]]s.

The term ''computer language'' is sometimes used interchangeably with programming language.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Edmunds, The Prentice-Hall standard glossary of computer terminology, Prentice-Hall, 1985, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; However, the usage of both terms varies among authors, including the exact scope of each. One usage describes programming languages as a subset of computer languages.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal Lando, Anne Lapujade, Gilles Kassel, and Frédéric Fürst, ''[http://home.mis.u-picardie.fr/~site-ic/site/IMG/pdf/ICSOFT2007_final.pdf Towards a General Ontology of Computer Programs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707093557/http://home.mis.u-picardie.fr/~site-ic/site/IMG/pdf/ICSOFT2007_final.pdf |date=7 July 2015 }}'', [http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icsoft/icsoft2007-1.html ICSOFT 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427063709/http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icsoft/icsoft2007-1.html |date=27 April 2010 }}, pp. 163-170&lt;/ref&gt; In this vein, languages used in computing that have a different goal than expressing computer programs are generically designated computer languages. For instance, markup languages are sometimes referred to as computer languages to emphasize that they are not meant to be used for programming.&lt;ref&gt;S.K. Bajpai, ''Introduction To Computers And C Programming'', New Age International, 2007, {{ISBN|81-224-1379-X}}, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;

Another usage regards programming languages as theoretical constructs for programming abstract machines, and computer languages as the subset thereof that runs on physical computers, which have finite hardware resources.&lt;ref&gt;R. Narasimahan, Programming Languages and Computers: A Unified Metatheory, pp. 189--247 in Franz Alt, Morris Rubinoff (eds.) Advances in computers, Volume 8, Academic Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-12-012108-5}}, p.215: "[...] the model [...] for computer languages differs from that [...] for programming languages in only two respects. In a computer language, there are only finitely many names--or registers--which can assume only finitely many values--or states--and these states are not further distinguished in terms of any other attributes. [author's footnote:] This may sound like a truism but its implications are far reaching. For example, it would imply that any model for programming languages, by fixing certain of its parameters or features, should be reducible in a natural way to a model for computer languages."&lt;/ref&gt; [[John C. Reynolds]] emphasizes that [[formal specification]] languages are just as much programming languages as are the languages intended for execution. He also argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior of a computer are programming languages, despite the fact they are commonly not Turing-complete, and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Reynolds, ''Some thoughts on teaching programming and programming languages'', [[SIGPLAN]] Notices, Volume 43, Issue 11, November 2008, p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of programming languages}}

===Early developments===
Very early computers, such as [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], were programmed without the help of a [[stored program]], by modifying their circuitry or setting banks of physical controls.

Slightly later, programs could be written in [[machine language]], where the programmer writes each instruction in a numeric form the hardware can execute directly. For example, the instruction to add the value in two memory location might consist of 3 numbers: an "opcode" that selects the "add" operation, and two memory locations. The programs, in decimal or binary form, were read in from [[punched card]]s or paper tape or [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]] or toggled in on switches on the [[front panel]] of the computer.  Machine languages were later termed ''[[first-generation programming language]]s'' (1GL).

The next step was development of so-called ''[[second-generation programming language]]s'' (2GL) or [[assembly language]]s, which were still closely tied to the [[instruction set architecture]] of the specific computer. These served to make the program much more human-readable and relieved the programmer of tedious and error-prone address calculations.

The first ''[[high-level programming language]]s'', or ''[[third-generation programming language]]s'' (3GL), were written in the 1950s. An early high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was [[Plankalkül]], developed for the German [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] by [[Konrad Zuse]] between 1943 and 1945. However, it was not implemented until 1998 and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Raúl Rojas|Rojas, Raúl]], et al. (2000). "Plankalkül: The First High-Level Programming Language and its Implementation". Institut für Informatik, Freie Universität Berlin, Technical Report B-3/2000.

[[John Mauchly]]'s [[Short Code (computer language)|Short Code]], proposed in 1949, was one of the first high-level languages ever developed for an [[electronic computer]].&lt;ref name=Sebesta&gt;Sebesta, W.S Concepts of Programming languages. 2006;M6 14:18 pp.44. {{ISBN|0-321-33025-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[machine code]], Short Code statements represented mathematical expressions in understandable form. However, the program had to be translated into [[machine code]] every time it ran, making the process much slower than running the equivalent [[machine code]].

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Manchester Mark2.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Manchester Mark 1]] ran programs written in [[Autocode]] from 1952.]] --&gt;
At the [[University of Manchester]], [[Alick Glennie]] developed [[Autocode]] in the early 1950s. A [[high-level programming language|programming language]], it used a [[compiler]] to automatically convert the language into machine code. The first code and compiler was developed in 1952 for the [[Manchester Mark 1|Mark 1]] computer at the University of Manchester and is considered to be the first [[compiler|compiled]] high-level programming language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Knuth|first=Donald E.|last2=Pardo|first2=Luis Trabb|title=Early development of programming languages|journal=Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology|volume=7|pages=419–493|publisher=Marcel Dekker |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kpYX_lNI0VMC|title=Digitized: The Science of Computers and how it Shapes Our World|author=Peter J.

The second autocode was developed for the Mark 1 by [[Tony Brooker|R. A. Brooker]] in 1954 and was called the "Mark 1 Autocode". Brooker also developed an autocode for the [[Ferranti Mercury]] in the 1950s in conjunction with the University of Manchester. The version for the [[EDSAC|EDSAC 2]] was devised by [[David Hartley (computer scientist)|D. F. Hartley]] of  [[University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory]] in 1961. Known as EDSAC 2 Autocode, it was a straight development from Mercury Autocode adapted for local circumstances and was noted for its object code optimisation and source-language diagnostics which were advanced for the time. A contemporary but separate thread of development, [[Atlas Autocode]] was developed for the University of Manchester [[Atlas Computer (Manchester)|Atlas 1]] machine.

In 1954, [[FORTRAN]] was invented at IBM by [[John Backus]]. It was the first widely used [[high-level language|high-level general purpose programming language]] to have a functional implementation, as opposed to just a design on paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17704662/ |title=Fortran creator John Backus dies - Tech and gadgets- msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-03-20 |accessdate=2010-04-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117182533/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17704662/ |archivedate=17 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.grin.edu/~rebelsky/Courses/CS302/99S/Outlines/outline.02.html |title=CSC-302 99S : Class 02: A Brief History of Programming Languages |publisher=Math.grin.edu |accessdate=2010-04-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715042920/http://www.math.grin.edu/~rebelsky/Courses/CS302/99S/Outlines/outline.02.html |archivedate=15 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still a popular language for [[high-performance computing]]&lt;ref name=hpc&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1820518|author=Eugene Loh|title=The Ideal HPC Programming Language|journal=Queue|date=18 June 2010|publisher=Association of Computing Machines|volume=8|issue=6|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304015345/http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1820518|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's [[TOP500|fastest supercomputers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = HPL - A Portable Implementation of the High-Performance Linpack Benchmark for Distributed-Memory Computers |accessdate = 2015-02-21 |url = http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150215031500/http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/ |archivedate = 15 February 2015 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early programming language was devised by [[Grace Hopper]] in the US, called [[FLOW-MATIC]]. It was developed for the [[UNIVAC I]] at [[Remington Rand]] during the period from 1955 until 1959. Hopper found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical notation, and in early 1955, she and her team wrote a specification for an [[English language|English]] programming language and implemented a prototype.&lt;ref&gt;Hopper (1978) p.&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/ref&gt; The FLOW-MATIC compiler became publicly available in early 1958 and was substantially complete in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Sammet (1969) p.&amp;nbsp;316&lt;/ref&gt; Flow-Matic was a major influence in the design of [[COBOL]], since only it and its direct descendant [[AIMACO]] were in actual use at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Sammet (1978) p.&amp;nbsp;204.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refinement===
The increased use of high-level languages introduced a requirement for ''[[low-level programming language]]s'' or ''[[system programming language]]s''. These languages, to varying degrees, provide facilities between assembly languages and high-level languages and can be used to perform tasks which require direct access to hardware facilities but still provide higher-level control structures and error-checking.
   
The period from the 1960s to the late 1970s brought the development of the major language paradigms now in use:
* [[APL (programming language)|APL]] introduced ''[[array programming]]'' and influenced [[functional programming]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Wexelblat: ''History of Programming Languages'', Academic Press, 1981, chapter XIV.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[ALGOL]] refined both ''structured procedural programming'' and the discipline of [[programming language specification|language specification]]; the "Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language [[ALGOL 60]]" became a model for how later language specifications were written.
* [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], implemented in 1958, was the first dynamically typed ''[[functional programming]]'' language
* In the 1960s, [[Simula]] was the first language designed to support ''[[object-oriented programming]]''; in the mid-1970s, [[Smalltalk]] followed with the first "purely" object-oriented language.
* [[C (programming language)|C]] was developed between 1969 and 1973 as a system programming language for the [[Unix]] operating system and remains popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~flab/languages.html|author=François Labelle|title=Programming Language Usage Graph|work=[[SourceForge]]|accessdate=21 June 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617055109/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Eflab/languages.html|archivedate=17 June 2006|df=dmy-all}}. This comparison analyzes trends in number of projects hosted by a popular community programming repository. During most years of the comparison, C leads by a considerable margin; in 2006, Java overtakes C, but the combination of C/C++ still leads considerably.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Prolog]], designed in 1972, was the first ''[[logic programming]]'' language.
* In 1978, [[ML (programming language)|ML]] built a polymorphic type system on top of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], pioneering ''[[Type system|statically typed]] [[functional programming]]'' languages.
Each of these languages spawned descendants, and most modern programming languages count at least one of them in their ancestry.

The 1960s and 1970s also saw considerable debate over the merits of ''[[structured programming]]'', and whether programming languages should be designed to support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Semicolon Wars|journal=American Scientist|first1=Brian|last1=Hayes|volume=94|issue=4|year=2006|pages=299–303|doi=10.1511/2006.60.299}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edsger W. Dijkstra|Edsger Dijkstra]], in a famous 1968 letter published in the [[Communications of the ACM]], argued that [[Goto|GOTO]] statements should be eliminated from all "higher level" programming languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dijkstra|first=Edsger W.|authorlink=Edsger Dijkstra|title=Go To Statement Considered Harmful|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=11|issue=3|date=March 1968|pages=147–148|url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD215.PDF|accessdate=2014-05-22|doi=10.1145/362929.362947|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513014557/http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD215.PDF|archivedate=13 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consolidation and growth===
[[File:Bangalore India Tech books for sale IMG 5261.jpg|thumb|240px|right|A selection of textbooks that teach programming, in languages both popular and obscure. These are only a few of the thousands of programming languages and dialects that have been designed in history.]]

The 1980s were years of relative consolidation. [[C++]] combined object-oriented and systems programming. The United States government standardized [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], a systems programming language derived from [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and intended for use by defense contractors. In Japan and elsewhere, vast sums were spent investigating so-called [[Fifth-generation programming language|"fifth generation" languages]] that incorporated logic programming constructs.&lt;ref&gt;Tetsuro Fujise, Takashi Chikayama, Kazuaki Rokusawa, Akihiko Nakase (December 1994). "KLIC: A Portable Implementation of KL1" ''Proc. of FGCS '94, ICOT'' Tokyo, December 1994. {{cite web |url=http://www.icot.or.jp/ARCHIVE/HomePage-E.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925132105/http://www.icot.or.jp/ARCHIVE/HomePage-E.html |archivedate=25 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }} KLIC is a portable implementation of a concurrent logic programming language [[KL1]].&lt;/ref&gt; The functional languages community moved to standardize [[ML (programming language)|ML]] and Lisp. Rather than inventing new paradigms, all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the previous decades.

One important trend in language design for programming large-scale systems during the 1980s was an increased focus on the use of ''modules'' or large-scale organizational units of code. [[Modula-2]], Ada, and ML all developed notable module systems in the 1980s, which were often wedded to [[generic programming]] constructs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jim Bender|url=http://readscheme.org/modules/|title=Mini-Bibliography on Modules for Functional Programming Languages|work=ReadScheme.org|accessdate=27 September 2006|date=15 March 2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924085057/http://readscheme.org/modules/|archivedate=24 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapid growth of the [[Internet]] in the mid-1990s created opportunities for new languages. [[Perl]], originally a Unix scripting tool first released in 1987, became common in dynamic [[website]]s. [[Java (programming language)|Java]] came to be used for server-side programming, and bytecode virtual machines became popular again in commercial settings with their promise of "[[Write once, run anywhere]]" ([[UCSD Pascal]] had been popular for a time in the early 1980s). These developments were not fundamentally novel, rather they were refinements of many existing languages and paradigms (although their syntax was often based on the C family of programming languages).

Programming language evolution continues, in both industry and research. Current directions include security and reliability verification, new kinds of modularity ([[mixin]]s, [[Delegation (programming)|delegates]], [[aspect-oriented programming|aspects]]), and database integration such as Microsoft's [[Language Integrated Query|LINQ]].

''[[Fourth-generation programming language]]s'' (4GL) are computer programming languages which aim to provide a higher level of abstraction of the internal computer hardware details than 3GLs. ''[[Fifth generation programming language]]s'' (5GL) are programming languages based on solving problems using constraints given to the program, rather than using an [[algorithm]] written by a programmer.

==Elements==
All programming languages have some [[language primitive|primitive]] building blocks for the description of data and the processes or transformations applied to them (like the addition of two numbers or the selection of an item from a collection). These primitives are defined by syntactic and semantic rules which describe their structure and meaning respectively.

===Syntax===
{{Main|Syntax (programming languages)}}
[[File:Python add5 parse.png|thumb|367px|[[Parse tree]] of [[Python (programming language)|Python code]] with inset tokenization]]
[[File:Python add5 syntax.svg|thumb|292px|[[Syntax highlighting]] is often used to aid programmers in recognizing elements of source code. The language above is [[Python (programming language)|Python]].]]
A programming language's surface form is known as its [[syntax (programming languages)|syntax]]. Most programming languages are purely textual; they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation, much like written natural languages. On the other hand, there are some programming languages which are more [[visual programming language|graphical]] in nature, using visual relationships between symbols to specify a program.

The syntax of a language describes the possible combinations of symbols that form a syntactically correct program. The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics (either [[Formal semantics of programming languages|formal]] or hard-coded in a [[Reference implementation (computing)|reference implementation]]). Since most languages are textual, this article discusses textual syntax.

Programming language syntax is usually defined using a combination of [[regular expression]]s (for [[lexical analysis|lexical]] structure) and [[Backus–Naur form]] (for [[context-free grammar|grammatical]] structure). Below is a simple grammar, based on [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]:
&lt;source lang="bnf"&gt;
expression ::= atom | list
atom       ::= number | symbol
number     ::= [+-]?['0'-'9']+
symbol     ::= ['A'-'Z''a'-'z'].*
list       ::= '(' expression* ')'
&lt;/source&gt;

This grammar specifies the following:
* an ''expression'' is either an ''atom'' or a ''list'';
* an ''atom'' is either a ''number'' or a ''symbol'';
* a ''number'' is an unbroken sequence of one or more decimal digits, optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign;
* a ''symbol'' is a letter followed by zero or more of any characters (excluding whitespace); and
* a ''list'' is a matched pair of parentheses, with zero or more ''expressions'' inside it.

The following are examples of well-formed token sequences in this grammar: &lt;code&gt;12345&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(a b c232 (1))&lt;/code&gt;.

Not all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct. Many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill-formed, per the language's rules; and may (depending on the language specification and the soundness of the implementation) result in an error on translation or execution. In some cases, such programs may exhibit [[undefined behavior]]. Even when a program is well-defined within a language, it may still have a meaning that is not intended by the person who wrote it.

Using [[natural language]] as an example, it may not be possible to assign a meaning to a grammatically correct sentence or the sentence may be false:
* "[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]]." is grammatically well-formed but has no generally accepted meaning.
* "John is a married bachelor." is grammatically well-formed but expresses a meaning that cannot be true.

The following [[C (programming language)|C language]] fragment is syntactically correct, but performs operations that are not semantically defined (the operation &lt;code&gt;*p &gt;&gt; 4&lt;/code&gt; has no meaning for a value having a complex type and &lt;code&gt;p-&gt;im&lt;/code&gt; is not defined because the value of &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; is the [[null pointer]]):

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
complex *p = NULL;
complex abs_p = sqrt(*p &gt;&gt; 4 + p-&gt;im);
&lt;/source&gt;

If the [[type declaration]] on the first line were omitted, the program would trigger an error on undefined variable "p" during compilation. However, the program would still be syntactically correct since type declarations provide only semantic information.

The grammar needed to specify a programming language can be classified by its position in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]]. The syntax of most programming languages can be specified using a Type-2 grammar, i.e., they are [[context-free grammar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Sipser|year=1996|title=[[Introduction to the Theory of Computation]]|publisher=PWS Publishing|isbn=0-534-94728-X |authorlink=Michael Sipser}} Section 2.2: Pushdown Automata, pp.101–114.&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages, including Perl and Lisp, contain constructs that allow execution during the parsing phase.

===Semantics===
The term [[Semantics#Computer science|''semantics'']] refers to the meaning of languages, as opposed to their form ([[#Syntax|syntax]]).

====Static semantics====
The static semantics defines restrictions on the structure of valid texts that are hard or impossible to express in standard syntactic formalisms.&lt;ref name="Aaby 2004"/&gt; For compiled languages, static semantics essentially include those semantic rules that can be checked at compile time. Examples include checking that every [[identifier]] is declared before it is used (in languages that require such declarations) or that the labels on the arms of a [[case statement]] are distinct.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lee Scott, ''Programming language pragmatics'', Edition 2, Morgan Kaufmann, 2006, {{ISBN|0-12-633951-1}}, p. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; Many important restrictions of this type, like checking that identifiers are used in the appropriate context (e.g. not adding an integer to a function name), or that [[subroutine]] calls have the appropriate number and type of arguments, can be enforced by defining them as rules in a [[logic]] called a [[type system]]. Other forms of [[static code analysis|static analyses]] like [[data flow analysis]] may also be part of static semantics. Newer programming languages like [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] have [[definite assignment analysis]], a form of data flow analysis, as part of their static semantics.

====Dynamic semantics====
{{main|Semantics of programming languages}}
Once data has been specified, the machine must be instructed to perform operations on the data. For example, the semantics may define the [[evaluation strategy|strategy]] by which expressions are evaluated to values, or the manner in which [[control flow|control structures]] conditionally execute [[Statement (computer science)|statements]]. The ''dynamic semantics'' (also known as ''execution semantics'') of a language defines how and when the various constructs of a language should produce a program behavior. There are many ways of defining execution semantics. Natural language is often used to specify the execution semantics of languages commonly used in practice. A significant amount of academic research went into [[formal semantics of programming languages]], which allow execution semantics to be specified in a formal manner. Results from this field of research have seen limited application to programming language design and implementation outside academia.

===Type system===
{{Main|Data type|Type system|Type safety}}

A type system defines how a programming language classifies values and expressions into ''types'', how it can manipulate those types and how they interact. The goal of a type system is to verify and usually enforce a certain level of correctness in programs written in that language by detecting certain incorrect operations. Any [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] type system involves a trade-off: while it rejects many incorrect programs, it can also prohibit some correct, albeit unusual programs. In order to bypass this downside, a number of languages have ''type loopholes'', usually unchecked [[Type conversion#Explicit type conversion|casts]] that may be used by the programmer to explicitly allow a normally disallowed operation between different types. In most typed languages, the type system is used only to [[type checking|type check]] programs, but a number of languages, usually functional ones, [[type inference|infer types]], relieving the programmer from the need to write type annotations. The formal design and study of type systems is known as ''[[type theory]]''.

====Typed versus untyped languages====
A language is ''typed'' if the specification of every operation defines types of data to which the operation is applicable, with the implication that it is not applicable to other types.&lt;ref name="typing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acooke.org/comp-lang.html|author=Andrew Cooke|title=Introduction To Computer Languages|accessdate=13 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815140215/http://www.acooke.org/comp-lang.html|archivedate=15 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the data represented by &lt;code&gt;"this text between the quotes"&lt;/code&gt; is a [[String literal|string]], and in many programming languages dividing a number by a string has no meaning and will be rejected by the compilers. The invalid operation may be detected when the program is compiled ("static" type checking) and will be rejected by the compiler with a compilation error message, or it may be detected when the program is run ("dynamic" type checking), resulting in a run-time [[Exception handling|exception]]. Many languages allow a function called an exception handler to be written to handle this exception and, for example, always return "-1" as the result.

A special case of typed languages are the ''single-type'' languages. These are often scripting or markup languages, such as [[REXX]] or [[Standard Generalized Markup Language|SGML]], and have only one data type{{dubious|date=March 2018}}-—most commonly character strings which are used for both symbolic and numeric data.

In contrast, an ''untyped language'', such as most [[assembly language]]s, allows any operation to be performed on any data, which are generally considered to be sequences of bits of various lengths.&lt;ref name="typing"/&gt; High-level languages which are untyped include [[BCPL]], [[Tcl]], and some varieties of [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]].

In practice, while few languages are considered typed from the point of view of [[type theory]] (verifying or rejecting ''all'' operations), most modern languages offer a degree of typing.&lt;ref name="typing"/&gt; Many production languages provide means to bypass or subvert the type system, trading type-safety for finer control over the program's execution (see [[Type conversion#Explicit type conversion|casting]]).

====Static versus dynamic typing====
In ''[[Type system|static typing]]'', all expressions have their types determined prior to when the program is executed, typically at compile-time. For example, 1 and (2+2) are integer expressions; they cannot be passed to a function that expects a string, or stored in a variable that is defined to hold dates.&lt;ref name="typing"/&gt;

Statically typed languages can be either ''[[Manifest typing|manifestly typed]]'' or ''[[Type inference|type-inferred]]''. In the first case, the programmer must explicitly write types at certain textual positions (for example, at variable [[declaration (computer science)|declarations]]). In the second case, the compiler ''infers'' the types of expressions and declarations based on context. Most mainstream statically typed languages, such as [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], are manifestly typed. Complete type inference has traditionally been associated with less mainstream languages, such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. However, many manifestly typed languages support partial type inference; for example, [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] all infer types in certain limited cases.&lt;ref&gt;Specifically, instantiations of [[generic programming|generic]] types are inferred for certain expression forms. Type inference in Generic Java—the research language that provided the basis for Java 1.5's bounded [[polymorphism in object-oriented programming|parametric polymorphism]] extensions—is discussed in two informal manuscripts from the Types mailing list: [http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00849.html Generic Java type inference is unsound] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129073839/http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00849.html |date=29 January 2007 }} ([[Alan Jeffrey]], 17 December 2001) and [http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00921.html Sound Generic Java type inference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129073849/http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00921.html |date=29 January 2007 }} ([[Martin Odersky]], 15 January 2002). C#'s type system is similar to Java's, and uses a similar partial type inference scheme.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some programming languages allow for some types to be automatically converted to other types; for example, an int can be used where the program expects a float.

''[[Type system|Dynamic typing]]'', also called ''latent typing'', determines the type-safety of operations at run time; in other words, types are associated with ''run-time values'' rather than ''textual expressions''.&lt;ref name="typing"/&gt; As with type-inferred languages, dynamically typed languages do not require the programmer to write explicit type annotations on expressions. Among other things, this may permit a single variable to refer to values of different types at different points in the program execution. However, type [[Software bug|errors]] cannot be automatically detected until a piece of code is actually executed, potentially making [[debugging]] more difficult. [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[JavaScript]], and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] are all examples of dynamically typed languages.

====Weak and strong typing====
''[[Weak typing]]'' allows a value of one type to be treated as another, for example treating a [[String (computer science)|string]] as a number.&lt;ref name="typing"/&gt; This can occasionally be useful, but it can also allow some kinds of program faults to go undetected at [[compile time]] and even at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]].

''[[Strongly typed programming language|Strong typing]]'' prevents the above. An attempt to perform an operation on the wrong type of value raises an error.&lt;ref name="typing"/&gt; Strongly typed languages are often termed ''type-safe'' or ''[[type safety|safe]]''.

An alternative definition for "weakly typed" refers to languages, such as [[Perl]] and [[JavaScript]], which permit a large number of implicit type conversions. In JavaScript, for example, the expression &lt;code&gt;2 * x&lt;/code&gt; implicitly converts &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to a number, and this conversion succeeds even if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;, an &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt;, or a string of letters. Such implicit conversions are often useful, but they can mask programming errors.
''Strong'' and ''static'' are now generally considered orthogonal concepts, but usage in the literature differs. Some use the term ''strongly typed'' to mean ''strongly, statically typed'', or, even more confusingly, to mean simply ''statically typed''. Thus [[C (programming language)|C]] has been called both strongly typed and weakly, statically typed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-4.html|title=Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme|date=20 February 1998|accessdate=9 June 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714212928/http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-4.html|archivedate=14 July 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cardelli85understanding.html|title=On Understanding Types, Data Abstraction, and Polymorphism|author=[[Luca Cardelli]] and [[Peter Wegner]]|work=Manuscript (1985)|accessdate=9 June 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619072646/http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cardelli85understanding.html|archivedate=19 June 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It may seem odd to some professional programmers that C could be "weakly, statically typed". However, notice that the use of the generic pointer, the '''void*''' pointer, does allow for casting of pointers to other pointers without needing to do an explicit cast. This is extremely similar to somehow casting an array of bytes to any kind of datatype in C without using an explicit cast, such as &lt;code&gt;(int)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;(char)&lt;/code&gt;.

===Standard library and run-time system===
{{main|Standard library}}

Most programming languages have an associated core [[Library (computing)|library]] (sometimes known as the 'standard library', especially if it is included as part of the published language standard), which is conventionally made available by all implementations of the language. Core libraries typically include definitions for commonly used algorithms, data structures, and mechanisms for input and output.

The line between a language and its core library differs from language to language. In some cases, the language designers may treat the library as a separate entity from the language. However, a language's core library is often treated as part of the language by its users, and some language specifications even require that this library be made available in all implementations. Indeed, some languages are designed so that the meanings of certain syntactic constructs cannot even be described without referring to the core library. For example, in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], a string literal is defined as an instance of the &lt;code&gt;java.lang.String&lt;/code&gt; class; similarly, in [[Smalltalk]], an [[anonymous function]] expression (a "block") constructs an instance of the library's &lt;code&gt;BlockContext&lt;/code&gt; class. Conversely, [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] contains multiple coherent subsets that suffice to construct the rest of the language as library macros, and so the language designers do not even bother to say which portions of the language must be implemented as language constructs, and which must be implemented as parts of a library.

==Design and implementation==
Programming languages share properties with natural languages related to their purpose as vehicles for communication, having a syntactic form separate from its semantics, and showing ''language families'' of related languages branching one from another.&lt;ref name="Fischer"&gt;Steven R. Fischer, ''A history of language'', Reaktion Books, 2003, {{ISBN|1-86189-080-X}}, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="levenez"&gt;{{cite web|author=Éric Lévénez|title=Computer Languages History|year=2011|url=http://www.levenez.com/lang/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060107162045/http://www.levenez.com/lang/|archivedate=7 January 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as artificial constructs, they also differ in fundamental ways from languages that have evolved through usage. A significant difference is that a programming language can be fully described and studied in its entirety, since it has a precise and finite definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/info/Projects/Nuprl/cs611/fall94notes/cn2/subsection3_1_3.html|author=Jing Huang|title=Artificial Language vs. Natural Language|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903084542/http://www.cs.cornell.edu/info/Projects/Nuprl/cs611/fall94notes/cn2/subsection3_1_3.html|archivedate=3 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, natural languages have changing meanings given by their users in different communities. While [[constructed languages]] are also artificial languages designed from the ground up with a specific purpose, they lack the precise and complete semantic definition that a programming language has.

Many programming languages have been designed from scratch, altered to meet new needs, and combined with other languages. Many have eventually fallen into disuse. Although there have been attempts to design one "universal" programming language that serves all purposes, all of them have failed to be generally accepted as filling this role.&lt;ref&gt;IBM in first publishing PL/I, for example, rather ambitiously titled its manual ''The universal programming language PL/I'' (IBM Library; 1966). The title reflected IBM's goals for unlimited subsetting capability: ''PL/I is designed in such a way that one can isolate subsets from it satisfying the requirements of particular applications.'' ({{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=PL/I&amp;oldid=19175|title=PL/I|work=Encyclopedia of Mathematics|accessdate=29 June 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426010947/http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=PL%2FI&amp;oldid=19175|archivedate=26 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}). [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] and [[UNCOL]] had similar early goals.&lt;/ref&gt; The need for diverse programming languages arises from the diversity of contexts in which languages are used:
* Programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists to huge systems written by hundreds of [[programmer]]s.
* Programmers range in expertise from novices who need simplicity above all else, to experts who may be comfortable with considerable complexity.
* Programs must balance speed, size, and simplicity on systems ranging from [[microcontroller]]s to [[supercomputer]]s.
* Programs may be written once and not change for generations, or they may undergo continual modification.
* Programmers may simply differ in their tastes: they may be accustomed to discussing problems and expressing them in a particular language.

One common trend in the development of programming languages has been to add more ability to solve problems using a higher level of [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]]. The earliest programming languages were tied very closely to the underlying hardware of the computer. As new programming languages have developed, features have been added that let programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware instructions. Because programmers are less tied to the complexity of the computer, their programs can do more computing with less effort from the programmer. This lets them write more functionality per time unit.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick P. Brooks, Jr.: ''The Mythical Man-Month,'' Addison-Wesley, 1982, pp. 93-94&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|English-like programming languages}}
[[Natural language programming]] has been proposed as a way to eliminate the need for a specialized language for programming. However, this goal remains distant and its benefits are open to debate. [[Edsger W. Dijkstra]] took the position that the use of a formal language is essential to prevent the introduction of meaningless constructs, and dismissed [[natural language programming]] as "foolish".&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, Edsger W. [http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD667.html On the foolishness of "natural language programming."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120201526/http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD667.html |date=20 January 2008 }} EWD667.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Perlis]] was similarly dismissive of the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perlis|first=Alan|url=http://www-pu.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/users/klaeren/epigrams.html|title=Epigrams on Programming|work=SIGPLAN Notices Vol. 17, No. 9|date=September 1982|pages=7–13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990117034445/http://www-pu.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/users/klaeren/epigrams.html|archivedate=17 January 1999|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hybrid approaches have been taken in [[Structured English]] and [[SQL]].

A language's designers and users must construct a number of artifacts that govern and enable the practice of programming. The most important of these artifacts are the language ''specification'' and ''implementation''.

===Specification===
{{Main|Programming language specification}}

The specification of a programming language is an artifact that the language [[programmer|users]] and the [[programming language implementation|implementors]] can use to agree upon whether a piece of [[source code]] is a valid [[computer program|program]] in that language, and if so what its behavior shall be.

A programming language specification can take several forms, including the following:
* An explicit definition of the syntax, static semantics, and execution semantics of the language. While syntax is commonly specified using a formal grammar, semantic definitions may be written in [[natural language]] (e.g., as in the [[C (programming language)|C language]]), or a [[formal semantics of programming languages|formal semantics]] (e.g., as in [[Standard ML]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Milner|first=R.|authorlink=Robin Milner |author2=[[Mads Tofte|M. Tofte]] |author3=[[Robert Harper (computer scientist)|R. Harper]] |author4=D. MacQueen |title=The Definition of Standard ML (Revised)|publisher=MIT Press|year=1997|isbn=0-262-63181-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Kelsey|author2=William Clinger|author3=Jonathan Rees|title=Section 7.2 Formal semantics|work=Revised&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme|url=http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-10.html#%_sec_7.2|date=February 1998|accessdate=9 June 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706081110/http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-10.html#%_sec_7.2|archivedate=6 July 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifications).
* A description of the behavior of a [[compiler|translator]] for the language (e.g., the [[C++]] and [[Fortran]] specifications). The syntax and semantics of the language have to be inferred from this description, which may be written in natural or a formal language.
* A [[reference implementation|''reference'' or ''model'' implementation]], sometimes [[Meta-circular evaluator|written in the language being specified]] (e.g., [[Prolog]] or [[REXX|ANSI REXX]]&lt;ref&gt;[[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] — Programming Language Rexx, X3-274.1996&lt;/ref&gt;). The syntax and semantics of the language are explicit in the behavior of the reference implementation.

===Implementation===
{{Main|Programming language implementation}}

An ''implementation'' of a programming language provides a way to write programs in that language and execute them on one or more configurations of hardware and software. There are, broadly, two approaches to programming language implementation: ''[[compiler|compilation]]'' and ''[[interpreter (computing)|interpretation]]''. It is generally possible to implement a language using either technique.

The output of a [[compiler]] may be executed by hardware or a program called an interpreter. In some implementations that make use of the interpreter approach there is no distinct boundary between compiling and interpreting. For instance, some implementations of [[BASIC]] compile and then execute the source a line at a time.

Programs that are executed directly on the hardware usually run several orders of magnitude faster than those that are interpreted in software.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

One technique for improving the performance of interpreted programs is [[just-in-time compilation]]. Here the [[virtual machine]], just before execution, translates the blocks of [[bytecode]] which are going to be used to machine code, for direct execution on the hardware.

==Proprietary languages==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}

Although most of the most commonly used programming languages have fully open specifications and implementations, many programming languages exist only as proprietary programming languages with the implementation available only from a single vendor, which may claim that such a proprietary language is their intellectual property. Proprietary programming languages are commonly [[domain specific language]]s or internal [[scripting language]]s for a single product; some proprietary languages are used only internally within a vendor, while others are available to external users.

Some programming languages exist on the border between proprietary and open; for example, [[Oracle Corporation]] asserts proprietary rights to some aspects of the [[Java programming language]],&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Microsoft]]'s [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] programming language, which has open implementations of most parts of the system, also has [[Common Language Runtime]] (CLR) as a closed environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerscience.org/resources/computer-programming-languages/|title=Guide to Programming Languages {{!}} ComputerScience.org|work=ComputerScience.org|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many proprietary languages are widely used, in spite of their proprietary nature; examples include [[MATLAB]], [[VBScript]], and [[Wolfram Language]].  Some languages may make the transition from closed to open; for example, [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]] was originally an Ericsson's internal programming language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-erlang1/index.html|title=The basics|date=2011-05-10|website=www.ibm.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Thousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computing field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=1 June 2009|url=http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/|title=HOPL: an interactive Roster of Programming Languages|publisher=[[Murdoch University]]|location=Australia|quote=This site lists 8512 languages.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220044217/http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/|archivedate=20 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programming languages differ from most other forms of human expression in that they require a greater degree of precision and completeness. When using a natural language to communicate with other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect their intent to be understood. However, figuratively speaking, computers "do exactly what they are told to do", and cannot "understand" what code the programmer intended to write. The combination of the language definition, a program, and the program's inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed, within the domain of control of that program. On the other hand, ideas about an algorithm can be communicated to humans without the precision required for execution by using [[pseudocode]], which interleaves natural language with code written in a programming language.

A programming language provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data, and the operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data. A [[programmer]] uses the [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstractions]] present in the language to represent the concepts involved in a computation. These concepts are represented as a collection of the simplest elements available (called [[language primitive|primitives]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html|title=Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs|author=Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman|accessdate=3 March 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226050622/http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html|archivedate=26 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Computer Programming|Programming]]'' is the process by which programmers combine these primitives to compose new programs, or adapt existing ones to new uses or a changing environment.

Programs for a computer might be [[Execution (computing)|executed]] in a [[Batch processing|batch process]] without human interaction, or a user might type [[Command (computing)|commands]] in an [[Session (computer science)|interactive session]] of an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]]. In this case the "commands" are simply programs, whose execution is chained together. When a language can run its commands through an interpreter (such as a [[Unix shell]] or other [[command-line interface]]), without compiling, it is called a [[scripting language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Measuring language usage===
{{Main|Measuring programming language popularity}}

Determining which is the most widely used programming language is difficult since the definition of usage varies by context. One language may occupy the greater number of programmer hours, a different one has more lines of code, and a third may consume the most CPU time. Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications. For example, [[COBOL]] is still strong in the corporate data center, often on large [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Other languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications.

Various methods of measuring language popularity, each subject to a different bias over what is measured, have been proposed:

==Dialects, flavors and implementations==
A '''dialect''' of a programming language or a [[data exchange language]] is a (relatively small) variation or extension of the language that does not change its intrinsic nature. With languages such as [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] and [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], standards may be considered insufficient, inadequate or illegitimate by implementors, so often they will deviate from the standard, making a new [[dialect]]. In other cases, a dialect is created for use in a [[domain-specific language]], often a subset. In the [[Common Lisp|Lisp]] world, most languages that use basic [[S-expression]] syntax and Lisp-like semantics are considered Lisp dialects, although they vary wildly, as do, say, [[Racket (programming language)|Racket]] and [[Clojure]]. As it is common for one language to have several dialects, it can become quite difficult for an inexperienced programmer to find the right documentation. The [[BASIC programming language]] has [[List of BASIC dialects|many dialects]].

The explosion of Forth dialects led to the saying "If you've seen one Forth... you've seen ''one'' Forth."

==Taxonomies==
{{details|Categorical list of programming languages}}
There is no overarching classification scheme for programming languages. A given programming language does not usually have a single ancestor language. Languages commonly arise by combining the elements of several predecessor languages with new ideas in circulation at the time. Ideas that originate in one language will diffuse throughout a family of related languages, and then leap suddenly across familial gaps to appear in an entirely different family.

The task is further complicated by the fact that languages can be classified along multiple axes. For example, Java is both an object-oriented language (because it encourages object-oriented organization) and a concurrent language (because it contains built-in constructs for running multiple [[Thread (computer science)|threads]] in parallel). [[Python (programming language)|Python]] is an object-oriented [[scripting language]].

In broad strokes, programming languages divide into ''[[programming paradigm]]s'' and a classification by ''intended domain of use,'' with [[general-purpose programming language]]s distinguished from [[domain-specific programming language]]s. Traditionally, programming languages have been regarded as describing computation in terms of imperative sentences, i.e. issuing commands. These are generally called [[imperative programming]] languages. A great deal of research in programming languages has been aimed at blurring the distinction between a program as a set of instructions and a program as an assertion about the desired answer, which is the main feature of [[declarative programming]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl A. Gunter, ''Semantics of Programming Languages: Structures and Techniques'', MIT Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0-262-57095-5}}, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; More refined paradigms include [[procedural programming]], [[object-oriented programming]], [[functional programming]], and [[logic programming]]; some languages are hybrids of paradigms or multi-paradigmatic. An [[assembly language]] is not so much a paradigm as a direct model of an underlying machine architecture. By purpose, programming languages might be considered general purpose, [[system programming language]]s, scripting languages, domain-specific languages, or concurrent/distributed languages (or a combination of these).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tunes.org/wiki/programming_20languages.html|title=TUNES: Programming Languages|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020203251/http://tunes.org/wiki/programming_20languages.html|archivedate=20 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some general purpose languages were designed largely with educational goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wirth|first=Niklaus|authorlink=Niklaus Wirth|title=Recollections about the development of Pascal|journal=Proc. 2nd [[SIGPLAN|ACM SIGPLAN]] conference on history of programming languages|pages=333–342|year=1993|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=155378|accessdate=30 June 2006|doi=10.1145/154766.155378|isbn=0-89791-570-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A programming language may also be classified by factors unrelated to programming paradigm. For instance, most programming languages use [[English language]] keywords, while [[Non-English-based programming languages|a minority do not]]. Other languages may be classified as being [[Esoteric programming language|deliberately esoteric]] or not.

{{Close Relationships}}
'''Relational transgressions''' occur when people violate implicit or explicit [[Interpersonal relationship|relational]] [[Norm (sociology)|rules]].  These transgressions include a wide variety of behaviors.  

Scholars tend to delineate relational transgressions into three categories or approaches.  

The first approach focuses on the aspect of certain behaviors as a violation of relational [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] and rules. 

The second approach focuses on the interpretive consequences of certain behaviors, particularly the degree to which they hurt the victim, imply disregard for the victim, and imply disregard for the relationship.

The third and final approach focuses more specifically on [[behaviors]] that constitute [[infidelity]] (a common form of relational transgression).&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"&gt;Metts and Cupach, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The boundaries of relational transgressions are permeable.  [[Betrayal]] for example, is often used as a synonym for a relational transgression.  In some instances, betrayal can be defined as a rule violation that is traumatic to a relationship, and in other instances as destructive conflict or reference to infidelity.  Common forms of relational transgressions include the following:  having sex with someone else, wanting to or actually dating others, deceiving one's partner about something significant, [[flirting]] with or kissing someone else, keeping secrets from your partner, becoming emotionally involved with someone else, and betraying the partner's confidence.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"&gt;Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual and operational definitions==

===Rule violations===
Rule violations are events, actions, and behaviors that violate an implicit or explicit relationship norm or rule.  Explicit [[Norm (sociology)|rules]] tend to be relationship specific, such as those prompted by the bad habits of a partner (e.g., excessive drinking or drug abuse), or those that emerge from attempts to manage conflict (e.g., rules that prohibit spending time with a former spouse or talking about a former girlfriend or boyfriend). Implicit rules tend to be those that are accepted as cultural standards for proper relationship conduct (e.g., [[monogamy]] and secrets kept private).  The focus on relational transgressions as rule violations presents an opportunity to examine a wide range of behaviors across a variety of relationship types.  This method facilitates analysis of transgressions from a rules perspective.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  In a study of college students' relational transgressions, the following nine categories emerged consistently.&lt;ref&gt;Metts and Cupach, 2007, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

# Inappropriate interaction: Instances in which a partner performs badly during an interaction, typically a conflict episode.
# Lack of sensitivity: Instances in which a partner exhibits thoughtless, disrespectful, or inconsiderate behavior.  Offender demonstrates a lack of concern or emotional responsiveness when expected and appropriate.
# Extrarelational involvement: Sexual or emotional involvement with persons other than the offended party.  Offender does not confound involvement with deception.
# Relational threat confounded by deception:  Instances in which a partner participates in sexual or emotional involvement with persons other than the offended party and then uses deception to conceal the involvement.
# Disregard for primary relationship: Actions that indicate the transgressor does not privilege the primary relationship; chooses other people or activities over partner or changes plans.
# Abrupt termination: Actions that terminate a relationship with no warning and no explanation.
# Broken promises and rule violations:  Occasions during which a partner fails to keep a promise, changes plans with no warning or explanation, or violates a rule that the offended person assumes was binding.
# Deception, secrets and privacy: Instances in which a partner lied, kept important information a secret, failed to keep sensitive information private, or violated privacy boundaries.
# [[Abuse]]: Verbal or physical threats.
 
Cameron, Ross, and Holmes (2002) identified 10 categories of common relational negative behavior that constitute relational transgressions as rule violations:&lt;ref name="Cameron, Ross, and Holmes, 2002"&gt;Cameron, Ross, and Holmes, 2002, p.310&lt;/ref&gt;
# Broken promises
# Overreaction to the victim's behavior
# Inconsiderate behavior
# Violating the victim's desired level of intimacy
# Neglecting the victim
# Threat of infidelity
# Infidelity
# Verbal aggression toward the victim
# Unwarranted disagreement
# Violent behavior toward the victim

===Infidelity===
{{Main|Infidelity}}
Infidelity is widely recognized as one of the most hurtful relational transgressions.  Around 30% to 40% of dating relationships are marked by at least one incident of sexual infidelity.&lt;ref name="Cameron, Ross, and Holmes, 2002"/&gt; It is typically among the most difficult transgressions to forgive.  There are typically four methods of discovery:   
# Finding out from a third party. 
# Witnessing the infidelity firsthand, such as  walking in on your partner with someone else. 
# Having the partner admit to infidelity after another partner questions. 
# Having the partner tell their partner on their own.
Partners who found out through a third party or by witnessing the infidelity firsthand were the least likely to forgive.  Partners who confessed on their own were the most likely to be forgiven.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

====Sexual vs. emotional infidelity====
[[Infidelity|Sexual infidelity]] refers to sexual activity with someone other than a person's partner.  Sexual infidelity can span a wide range of behavior and thoughts, including: sexual intercourse, heavy petting, passionate kissing, sexual fantasies, and sexual attraction.  It can involve a sustained relationship, a one-night stand, or a prostitute.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  Most people in the United States openly disapprove of sexual infidelity, but research indicates that infidelity is common.  Men are typically more likely than women to engage in a sexual affair, regardless if they are married or in a dating relationship.

[[Emotional affair|Emotional infidelity]] refers to emotional involvement with another person, which leads one's partner to channel emotional resources to someone else. Emotional infidelity can involve strong feelings of love and intimacy, nonsexual fantasies of falling in love, romantic attraction, or the desire to spend time with another individual.  Emotional infidelity may involve a coworker, Internet partner, face-to-face communication, or a long distance phone call.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  Emotional infidelity is likely related to dissatisfaction with the communication and social support an individual is receiving in his or her current relationship.&lt;ref name = "Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

Each type of infidelity evokes different responses. Sexual infidelity is more likely to result in  hostile, shocked, repulsed, humiliated, homicidal, or suicidal feelings. Emotional infidelity is more likely to evoke feelings of being undesirable, insecure, depressed, or abandoned. When both types of infidelity are present in a relationship, couples are more likely to break up than when only one type of infidelity is involved.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;

====Gender differences in infidelity====
While [[gender]] is not a reliable predictor of how any individual will react to sexual and [[Emotional affair|emotional infidelity]], there are nonetheless differences in how men and women on average react to sexual and [[Emotional affair|emotional infidelity]].  [[Western world|Culturally Western]] men, relative to culturally Western women, find it more difficult to forgive a partner's sexual infidelity than a partner's emotional infidelity. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}   Western men are also more likely to break up in response to a partner's [[Infidelity|sexual infidelity]] than in response to a partner's emotional infidelity. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  Conversely, Western women on average find it more difficult to forgive a partner's emotional infidelity than a partner's sexual infidelity, and are more likely to end a relationship in response to a partner's emotional infidelity. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  A possible explanation for these differences has been proposed by [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]]: over human evolution, a partner's sexual infidelity placed men, but not women, at risk of investing resources in a rival's offspring.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  Therefore, a partner's sexual infidelity represents a potentially more costly adaptive problem for men than women.  As such, modern men have psychological mechanisms that are acutely sensitive to a partner's sexual infidelity.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  

Whereas on average Western men are more acutely sensitive to sexual infidelity (supposedly driven by evolutionary requirements noted above), Western women are commonly believed to have greater sensitivity to emotional infidelity.  This response in women is, by the arguments of the theory above, driven by the perception that emotional infidelity suggests a long-term diversion of a partner's commitment, and a potential loss of resources.&lt;ref&gt;Shackelford, Buss, and Bennett, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Evolutionary psychology explains this difference by arguing that a woman's loss of male support would result in a diminished chance of survival for both the woman and her offspring.  Consequently, relationship factors that are more associated with commitment and partner investment play a more critical role in the psyche of women in contrast to men.&lt;ref name="Cann and Baucom, 2004"&gt;Cann and Baucom, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

When infidelity involves a former romantic partner, as opposed to a new partner, it is perceived to be more distressing – especially for women.  Both men and women overall view situations of sexual infidelity as more distressing than situations of emotional involvement.  The typical man, however, viewed only the former partner scenario as more distressing with regard to sexual infidelity; men made no distinction for emotional infidelity.  Women, however, view a former partner scenario as the most distressing option for both sexual and emotional infidelity.&lt;ref name="Cann and Baucom, 2004"/&gt; Men and women both judge infidels of the opposite gender as acting more intentionally than their own gender.&lt;ref&gt;Mongeau, Hale, and Alles, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

====Internet infidelity====
Recent research provides support for conceptualizing infidelity on a continuum ranging in severity from superficial/informal behavior to involving or goal-directed behavior.  This perspective accounts for the varying degrees of behavior (e.g., sexual, emotional) on the Internet.  A number of acts not involving direct, one-to-one communication with another person (e.g. posting a personal ad or looking at pornography) can be perceived as forms of infidelity.  Thus, communication with another live person is not necessary for infidelity to occur.   Accordingly, Internet infidelity is defined by Docan-Morgan and Docan (2007) as follows: "An act or actions engaged via the internet by one person with a committed relationship, where such an act occurs outside the primary relationship, and constitutes a breach of trust and/or violation of agreed-upon [[norm (sociology)|norms]] (overt or covert) by one or both individuals in that relationship with regard to relational exclusivity, and is perceived as having a particular degree of severity by one or both partners."&lt;ref&gt;Docan-Morgan and Docan, 2007, p.331&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jealousy===
{{Main|Jealousy}}

====Characteristics of jealousy====
Jealousy is the result of a relational transgression, such as a partner having a sexual or emotional affair.  Jealousy can also be seen as a transgression in its own right, when a partner's suspicions are unfounded.  Thus, jealousy is an important component of relational transgressions.  There are several types of jealousy.  Romantic jealousy occurs when a partner is concerned that a potential rival might interfere with his or her existing romantic relationship.  Sexual jealousy is a specific form of romantic jealousy where an individual worries that a rival is having or wants to have sex with his or her partner.  

Other forms of jealousy include:
*'''Friend jealousy''' – feeling threatened by a partner's relationships with friends.
*'''Family jealousy''' – feeling threatened by a partner's relationships with family members.
*'''Activity jealousy''' – perceiving that a partner's activities, such as work, hobbies, or school, are interfering with one's relationship.
*'''Power jealousy''' – perceiving that one's influence over a partner is being lost to others.
*'''Intimacy jealousy''' – believing that one's partner in engaging in more intimate communication, such as disclosure and advice seeking, with someone else.

Jealousy is different from [[envy]] and rivalry.  Envy occurs when people want something valuable that someone else has.  Rivalry occurs when two people are competing for something that neither person has.&lt;ref name = "Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

====Experiencing romantic jealousy====
Individuals who are experiencing jealous thoughts typically make primary and secondary cognitive appraisals about their particular situation.  Primary appraisals involve general evaluations about the existence and quality of a rival relationship.  Secondary appraisals involve more specific evaluations about the jealous situation, including possible causes of the jealousy and potential outcomes to the situation.  There are four common types of secondary appraisals:  
# Jealous people assess motives. 
# Jealous people compare themselves to their rival. 
# They evaluate their potential alternatives. 
# Finally, jealous people assess their potential loss.&lt;ref name = "Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

Jealous individuals make appraisals to develop coping strategies and assess potential outcomes.

Jealous individuals normally experience combinations of emotions, in addition to the aforementioned cognitive appraisals.  The most common emotions associated with jealousy are fear and anger; people are fearful of losing their relationship and they are often angry at their partner or rival.  Other common negative emotions associated with jealousy are sadness, guilt, hurt, and envy.  Sometimes, however, jealousy leads to positive emotions, including increased passion, love, and appreciation. 

Relational partners sometimes intentionally induce jealousy in their relationship.&lt;ref name = "Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  There are typically two types of goals for jealousy induction.  Relational rewards reflect the desire to improve the relationship, increase self-esteem, and increase relational rewards.  The second type of goal, relational revenge, reflects the desire to punish one's partner, the need for revenge, and the desire to control one's partner.  The tactic of inducing jealousy may produce unintended consequences, as jealousy often leads to other relational transgressions including violence.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischmann, Spitzberg, Andersen, and Roesch, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

====Communicative responses to jealousy====
Jealousy can involve a wide range of communicative responses.  These responses are based upon the individuals' goals and emotions.  The most common of these responses are negative affect expression, [[Integrative communication theory|integrative communication]], and distributive communication.  When people want to maintain their relationship, they use integrative communication and compensatory restoration.  People who are fearful of losing their relationships typically use compensatory restoration.  

Conversely, people who are concerned with maintaining their self-esteem allege that they deny jealous feelings.  When individuals are motivated to [[Uncertainty Reduction Theory|reduce uncertainty]] about their partner, they use integrative communication, surveillance, and rival contacts to seek additional information.  Communicative responses to jealousy may help reduce uncertainty and restore self-esteem, but they may actually increase uncertainty and negatively impact relationships and self-esteem in some instances. The type of communicative response used is critical.  

For example, avoidance/denial may be used to protect one's self-esteem, but it may also result in increased uncertainty and relational dissatisfaction, if the jealous partner is left with lingering suspicions.  Similarly, compensatory restoration may improve the relationship in some instances, but it may also communicate low self-esteem and desperation by the jealous individual.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Andersen, Jorgensen, Spitzberg, and Eloy, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  Distributive communication, which includes behaviors such as yelling and confrontation, may serve to vent negative emotion and retaliate by making the partner feel bad.  This may exacerbate an already negative situation and make reconciliation less likely.&lt;ref&gt;Bachman and Guerrero, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jealousy and relational satisfaction====
Jealousy is generally considered to be a relationship dysfunction, though it may have some positive relational properties.  These positive properties can be attained through development of one's ability to manage jealousy in a productive way, so that the jealous individual shows care and concern without seeming overly fearful, aggressive, or possessive.  Negative affect expression can be effective if used in conjunction with integrative communication.  Compensatory restoration can be effective, but when used in excess, too much can make an individual seem desperate and too eager to please, which can have detrimental effects on the relationships.&lt;ref name = "Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

====Rumination====
{{Main|Rumination (psychology)}}
From the aspect of jealousy, rumination reflects uncomfortable mulling about the security of a relationship.  Rumination refers to thoughts that are conscious, recurring, and not demanded by the individual's current environment.  Ruminative thoughts occur repetitively and are difficult to eliminate.  In the context of relational threats, rumination can be described as obsessive worry about the security of the current relationship.  Individuals who ruminate are very likely to respond to jealousy differently from individuals who do not ruminate.  Rumination is positively associated with several communicative responses to jealousy (e.g. compensatory restoration, negative affect expression, showing signs of possession, and derogation of competitors) that attempt to strengthen a relationship.  Rumination is also associated with responses that are counterproductive.  Despite efforts to restore relational intimacy, rumination sustains uncertainty, which thereby forms a cycle where rumination is sustained.  Rumination intensifies over time and serves as a constant reminder to the threat to the relationship, resulting in increased negative affect.  This negative affect is associated with destructive responses to jealousy including violent communication and violence towards objects.  Finally, jealous rumination is associated with relational distress and counterproductive responses to jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;Carson and Cupach, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sex differences in jealous emotions and communication====
Women generally experience more hurt, sadness, anxiety, and confusion than men, perhaps because they often [[blame]] themselves for the jealous situation.  Conversely, men have been found to deny jealous feelings and focus on increasing their self-esteem.  Generally speaking, women tend to be more focused on the relationship, while men tend to be more focused on individual concerns.  In communicative responses, women tend to use integrative communication, express negative affect, enhance their appearance, and use counterjealousy induction more often than jealous men.  Jealous men more often contact the rival, restrict the partner's access to potential rivals, and give gifts and spend money on the partner.  Jealous men also engage in dangerous behaviors, such as getting drunk and engaging in promiscuous sex with others.  Analysis from an evolutionary perspective would suggest that men focus on competing for mates and displaying resources (e.g., material goods to suggest financial security), while women focus on creating and enhancing social bonds and showcasing their beauty.&lt;ref name = "Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

===Deception===
{{Main|Interpersonal deception theory|Deception}}
Deception is a major relational transgression that often leads to feelings of betrayal and distrust between relational partners.  Deception violates relational [[Norm (sociology)|rules]] and is considered to be a negative violation of expectations.  Most people expect friends, relational partners, and even strangers to be truthful most of the time.  If people expected most conversations to be untruthful, talking and communicating with others would simply be unproductive and too difficult.  On a given day, it is likely that most human beings will either deceive or be deceived by another person.  A significant amount of deception occurs between romantic and relational partners.&lt;ref name = "Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

====Types====
Deception includes several types of communications or omissions that serve to distort or omit the complete truth.  Deception itself is intentionally managing verbal and/or nonverbal messages so that the message receiver will believe in a way that the message sender knows is false.  Intent is critical with regard to deception.  Intent differentiates between deception and an honest mistake.  The [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] explores the interrelation between 
communicative context and sender and receiver cognitions and behaviors in deceptive exchanges.  

Five primary forms of deception consist of the following:
* '''[[Lie]]s''': Making up information or giving information that is the opposite or very different from the truth.
* '''[[Equivocations]]''': Making an indirect, ambiguous, or contradictory statement.
* '''[[Lie#Lying_by_omission|Concealments]]''': Omitting information that is important or relevant to the given context, or engaging in behavior that helps hide relevant information.
* '''[[Exaggeration]]''': Overstatement or stretching the truth to a degree.
* '''[[Minimisation (psychology)|Understatement]]''': Minimization or downplaying aspects of the truth.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

====Motives====
There are three primary motivations for deceptions in close relationships.
*'''Partner-focused motives''': Using deception to avoid hurting the partner, helping the partner to enhance or maintain his or her [[self-esteem]], avoid worrying the partner, and protecting the partner's relationship with a third party.  Partner-motivated deception can sometimes be viewed as socially polite and relationally beneficial.
*'''Self-focused motives''':  Using deception to enhance or protect their [[self-image]], wanting to shield themselves from [[anger]], [[embarrassment]], or [[criticism]]. Self-focused deception is generally perceived as a more serious transgression than partner-focused deception because the deceiver is acting for selfish reasons rather than for the good of the relationship.
*'''Relationship-focused motives''': Using deception to limit relationship harm by avoiding conflict or relational trauma.  Relationally motivated deception can be beneficial to a relationship, and other times it can be harmful by further complicating matters.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

====Detection====
Deception detection between relational partners is extremely difficult, unless a partner tells a blatant or obvious lie or contradicts something the other partner knows to be true.  While it is difficult to deceive a partner over a long period of time, deception often occurs in day-to-day conversations between relational partners.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;   Detecting deception is difficult because there are no known completely reliable indicators of deception.  Deception, however, places a significant cognitive load on the deceiver.  He or she must recall previous statements so that his or her story remains consistent and believable.  As a result, deceivers often leak important information both verbally and nonverbally.  

Deception and its detection is a complex, fluid, and cognitive process that is based on the context of the message exchange.  The [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] posits that interpersonal deception is a dynamic, iterative process of mutual influence between a sender, who manipulates information to depart from the truth, and a receiver, who attempts to establish the validity of the message.&lt;ref&gt;Buller &amp; Burgoon, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  A deceiver's actions are interrelated to the message receiver's actions.  It is during this exchange that the deceiver will reveal verbal and nonverbal information about deceit.&lt;ref&gt;Burgoon &amp; Qin, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Some research has found that there are some cues that may be correlated with deceptive communication, but scholars frequently disagree about the effectiveness of many of these cues to serve as reliable indicators.  Noted deception scholar Aldert Vrij even states that there is no nonverbal behavior that is uniquely associated with deception.&lt;ref name="Vrij, 2008"&gt;Vrij, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;   As previously stated, a specific behavioral indicator of deception does not exist.  There are, however, some nonverbal behaviors that have been found to be correlated with deception.  Vrij found that examining a "cluster" of these cues was a significantly more reliable indicator of deception than examining a single cue.&lt;ref name="Vrij, 2008"/&gt; 

In terms of perceptions about the significance of deceiving a partner, women and men typically differ in their beliefs about deception.  Women view deception as a much more profound relational transgression than men.  Additionally, women rate lying in general as a less acceptable behavior than men.  Finally, women are much more likely to view any act of lying as significant (regardless of the subject matter) and more likely to report negative emotional reactions to lying.

=====Truth bias=====
The truth bias significantly impairs the ability of relational partners to detect deception.  In terms of deception, a truth bias reflects a tendency to judge more messages as truths than lies, independent of their actual veracity.&lt;ref&gt;Burgoon, Blair, and Strom, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  When judging message veracity, the truth bias contributes to an overestimate of the actual number of truths relative to the base rate of actual truths.  The truth bias is especially strong within close relationships.  People are highly inclined to trust the communications of others and are unlikely to question the relational partner unless faced with a major deviation of behavior that forces a reevaluation.  When attempting to detect deceit from a familiar person or relational partner, a large amount of information about the partner is brought to mind.  This information essentially overwhelms the receiver's cognitive ability to detect and process any cues to deception.  It is somewhat easier to detect deception in strangers, when less information about that person is brought to mind.&lt;ref&gt;Millar and Millar, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hurtful messages===
Messages that convey negative feelings or rejection lead to emotions such as hurt and anger. Hurtful messages are associated with less satisfying relationships.  Intentionally hurtful messages are among the most serious, as perceived by a partner.  Unlike physical pain that usually subsides over time, hurtful messages and hurt feelings often persist for a long period of time and be recalled even years after the event.  The interpersonal damage caused by hurtful messages is sometimes permanent.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, Springer, Negel, Ansell, and Evans, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  People are more likely to be upset if they believe their relational partner said something to deliberately hurt them.  Some of the most common forms of hurtful messages include evaluations, accusations, and informative statements.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  

Feeling devalued is a central component of hurtful messages.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  Similar to verbally aggressive messages, hurtful messages that are stated intensely may be viewed as particularly detrimental. The cliché "It's not what you say, but how you say it" is very applicable with regard to recipients' appraisals of hurtful messages.&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Females tend to experience more hurt than males in response to hurtful messages.&lt;ref&gt;Fine and Olson, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repairing the damage==

===Conceptualizing forgiveness===
{{Main|Forgiveness}}
Individuals tend to experience a wide array of complex [[emotion]]s following a relational transgression.  These emotions are shown to have utility as an initial coping mechanism.&lt;ref name="Metts, S., &amp; Cupach, W., 2007"&gt;Metts, S., &amp; Cupach, W., 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, fear can result in a protective orientation following a serious transgression;&lt;ref&gt;Izard &amp; Ackerman, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; sadness results in contemplation and reflection &lt;ref&gt;Barr-Zisowitz, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; while disgust causes us to repel from its source.&lt;ref&gt;Rozin, Haidt, &amp; McCauley, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  However, beyond the initial situation these emotions can be detrimental to one’s mental
and physical state.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, Exline, &amp; Sommer, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, forgiveness is viewed as a more productive means of dealing with the transgression along with engaging the one who committed the transgression.&lt;ref name="Metts, S., &amp; Cupach, W., 2007"/&gt;

Forgiving is not the act of excusing or condoning.  Rather, it is the process whereby negative emotions are transformed into positive emotions for the purpose of bringing emotional normalcy to a relationship.  In order to achieve this transformation the offended must forgo retribution and claims for retribution.&lt;ref&gt;Boon &amp; Sulsky, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  McCullough, Worthington, and Rachal (1997) defined forgiveness as a, “set of motivational changes whereby one becomes (a) decreasingly motivated to retaliate against an offending relationship partner, (b) decreasingly motivated to maintain estrangement from the offender, and (c) increasingly motivated by conciliation and goodwill for the offender, despite the offender’s hurtful actions”.&lt;ref&gt;McCullough, Worthington, and Rachal, 1997, p.323&lt;/ref&gt;  In essence, relational partners choose constructive behaviors that show an emotional commitment and willingness to sacrifice in order to achieve a state of forgiveness.

===Dimensions of forgiveness===
The link between reconciliation and forgiveness involves exploring two dimensions of forgiveness:  intrapsychic and interpersonal.  The '''intrapsychic''' dimension relates to the cognitive processes and interpretations associated with a transgression (i.e. internal state), whereas '''interpersonal''' forgiveness is the interaction between relational partners.  ''Total forgiveness'' is defined as including both the intrapsychic and interpersonal components which brings about a return to the conditions prior to the transgression.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister et al., 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  To only change one’s internal state is ''silent forgiveness'', and only having interpersonal interaction is considered ''hollow forgiveness''.

However, some scholars contend that these two dimensions (intrapsychic and interpersonal) are independent as the complexities associated with forgiveness involve gradations of both dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Fincham, 2000; Worthington, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a partner may not relinquish negative emotions yet choose to remain in the relationship because of other factors (e.g., children, financial concerns, etc.).  Conversely, one may grant forgiveness and release all negative emotions directed toward their partner, and still exit the relationship because trust cannot be restored.  Given this complexity, research has explored whether the transformation of negative emotions to positive emotions eliminates negative affect associated with a given offense.  The conclusions drawn from this research suggest that no correlation exists between forgiveness and unforgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Witvleit, Ludwig, and Vander Lann, 2001; Wade and Worthington, 2003; Konstam, Holmes, and Levine, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  Put simply, while forgiveness may be granted for a given transgression, the negative affect may not be reduced a corresponding amount.

===Determinants of forgiveness===
[[Image:Determinants of Forgiveness Graphic.JPG|thumb|upright=2.85|right|alt=Predictors of Forgiveness.|Predictors of forgiveness]] 

McCullough et al. (1998) outlined predictors of forgiveness into four broad categories &lt;ref&gt;McCullough et al., 1998; Metts and Cupach, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
*Personality traits of both partners
*Relationship quality
*Nature of the transgression
*Social-cognitive variables

While personality variables and characteristics of the relationship are preexisting to the occurrence of forgiveness, nature of the offense and social-cognitive determinants become apparent at the time of the transgression.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;

====Personality traits of both partners====
Forgivingness is defined as one’s general tendency to forgive transgressions.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this tendency differs from forgiveness which is a response associated with a specific transgression.  Listed below are characteristics of the forgiving personality as described by Emmons (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Emmons, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
*Does not seek revenge; effectively regulates negative affect
*Strong desire for a relationship free of conflict
*Shows empathy toward offender
*Does not personalize hurt associated with transgression

In terms of personality traits, [[agreeableness]] and [[neuroticism]] (i.e., instability, anxiousness, aggression) show consistency in predicting forgivingness and forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Ashton, Paunonen, Helmes, &amp; Jackson, 1998; Berry et al., 2001; Berry, Worthington, O’Connor, Parrott, &amp; Wade, 2005; Exline, Baumeister, Bushman, Campbell, &amp; Finkel, 2004; Hoyt et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Since forgiveness requires one to discard any desire for revenge, a vengeful personality tends to not offer forgiveness and may continue to harbor feelings of vengeance long after the transgression occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson et al., 2005; McCullough et al., 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that agreeableness is inversely correlated with motivations for revenge and avoidance, as well as positively correlated with benevolence.  As such, one who demonstrates the personality trait of agreeableness is prone to forgiveness as well as has a general disposition of forgivingness. Conversely, neuroticism was positively correlated with avoidance and vengefulness, but negatively correlated with benevolence.  Consequently, a neurotic personality is less apt to forgive or to have a disposition of forgivingness.

Though the personality traits of the offended have a predictive value of forgiveness, the personality of the offender also has an effect on whether forgiveness is offered.  Offenders who show sincerity when seeking forgiveness and are persuasive in downplaying the impact of the transgression will have a positive effect on whether the offended will offer forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt et al., 2005; Wolf-Smith &amp; LaRossa, 1992; Metts and Cupach, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Narcissistic]] personalities, for example, may be categorized as persuasive transgressors.  This is driven by the narcissist to downplay their transgressions, seeing themselves as perfect and seeking to save face at all costs.&lt;ref&gt;Exline et al, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a dynamic suggests that personality determinants of forgiveness may involve not only the personality of the offended, but also that of the offender.

====Relationship quality====
The quality of a relationship between offended and offending partners can affect whether forgiveness is both sought and given.  In essence, the more invested one is in a relationship, the more prone they are to minimize the hurt associated with transgressions and seek reconciliation.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  

McCullough et al. (1998) provides seven reasons behind why those in relationships will seek to forgive:&lt;ref&gt;McCullough et al., 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
# High investment in relationship (e.g., children, joint finances, etc.)
# Views relationship as long term commitment
# Have high degree of common interests
# Is selfless in regard to their partner
# Willingness to take viewpoint of partner (i.e. empathy)
# Assumes motives of partner are in best interest of relationship (e.g., criticism is taken as constructive feedback)
# Willingness to apologize for transgressions

Relationship maintenance activities are a critical component to maintaining high quality relationships.  While being heavily invested tends to lead to forgiveness, one may be in a skewed relationship where the partner who is heavily invested is actually under benefitted.  This leads to an over benefitted partner who is likely to take the relationship for granted and will not be as prone to exhibit relationship repair behaviors.  As such, being mindful of the quality of a relationship will best position partners to address transgressions through a stronger willingness to forgive and seek to normalize the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Fincham et al., 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Another relationship factor that affects forgiveness is history of past conflict.  If past conflicts ended badly (i.e., reconciliation/forgiveness was either not achieved or achieved after much conflict), partners will be less prone to seek out or offer forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  As noted earlier, maintaining a balanced relationship (i.e. no partner over/under benefitted) has a positive effect on relationship quality and tendency to forgive.  In that same vein, partners are more likely to offer forgiveness if their partners had recently forgiven them for a transgression.&lt;ref&gt;Metts, Morse et al., 
2001&lt;/ref&gt;  However, if a transgression is repeated resentment begins to build which has an adverse effect on the offended partner’s desire to offer forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;

====Nature of the transgression====
The most notable feature of a transgression to have an effect on forgiveness is the seriousness of the offense.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  Some transgressions are perceived as being so serious that they are considered unforgivable.&lt;ref&gt;Younger et al., 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  To counter the negative affect associated with a severe transgression, the offender may engage in repair strategies to lessen the perceived hurt of the transgression.  The offender’s communication immediately following a transgression has the greatest predictive value on whether forgiveness will be granted.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  

Consequently, offenders who immediately apologize, take responsibility and show remorse have the greatest chance of obtaining forgiveness from their partner.&lt;ref&gt;McCullough et al., 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, self-disclosure of a transgression yields much greater results than if a partner is informed of the transgression through a third party.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  By taking responsibility for one’s actions and being forthright through self-disclosure of an offense, partners may actually form closer bonds from the reconciliation associated with a serious transgression.  As noted in the section on personality, repeated transgressions cause these relationship repair strategies to have a more muted effect as resentment begins to build and trust erodes.

==== Social-cognitive variables ====
Attributions of responsibility for a given transgression may have an adverse effect on forgiveness.  Specifically, if a transgression is viewed as intentional or malicious, the offended partner is less likely to feel empathy and forgive.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  Based on the notion that forgiveness is driven primarily by empathy, the offender must accept responsibility and seek forgiveness immediately following the transgression, as apologies have shown to elicit empathy from the offended partner.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  The resulting feelings of empathy elicited in the offended partner may cause them to better relate to the guilt and loneliness their partner may feel as a result of the transgression.  In this state of mind, the offended partner is more likely to seek to normalize the relationship through granting forgiveness and restoring closeness with their partner.&lt;ref&gt;McCullough et al, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remedial strategies for the offender===
Prior sections offered definitions of forgiveness along with determinants of forgiveness from the perspective of the partner who has experienced the hurtful transgression.  As noted earlier, swift apologies and utilization of repair strategies by the offender have the greatest likelihood of eliciting empathy from the offended and ultimately receiving forgiveness for the transgression.  The sections below address remedial strategies offenders may use to facilitate a state in which the offended more likely to offer forgiveness and seek to normalize the relationship.

====Apologies/concessions====
Most common of the remedial strategies, an apology is the most straightforward means by which to admit responsibility, express regret, and seek forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  Noted earlier, apologies are most effective if provided in a timely manner and involve a self-disclosure.  Apologies occurring after discovery of a transgression by a third party are much less effective.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  Though apologies can range from a simple, “I’m sorry” to more elaborate forms, offenders are most successful when offering more complex apologies to match the seriousness of the transgression.&lt;ref&gt;Darby &amp; Schlenker, 1982, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

====Excuses/justifications====
{{see also|Rationalization (making excuses)}}
Rather than accepting responsibility for a transgression through the form of an apology, a transgressor who explains why they engaged in a behavior is engaging in excuses or justifications.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  While excuses and justifications aim to minimize blame on the transgressor, the two address blame minimization from completely opposite perspectives. Excuses attempt to [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimize]] [[blame]] by focusing on a transgressor’s inability to control their actions (e.g., “How would I have known my exgirlfriend was going to be at the party.”) or displace blame on a third party (e.g., “I went to lunch with my exgirlfriend because I did not want to hurt her feelings.”)&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  Conversely, a justification minimizes blame by suggesting that actions surrounding the transgression were justified or that the transgression was not severe.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  For example, a transgressor may justify having lunch with a past romantic interest, suggesting to their current partner that the lunch meeting was of no major consequence (e.g., “We are just friends.”)

====Refusals====
Refusals are where a transgressor claims no blame for the perceived transgression.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  This is a departure from apologies and excuses/justifications which involve varying degrees of blame acceptance.  In the case of a refusal, the transgressor believes that they have not done anything wrong.  Such a situation points out the complexity of relational transgressions.  Perception of both partners must be taken into account when recognizing and addressing transgressions.  For example, Bob and Sally have just started to date, but have not addressed whether they are mutually exclusive.  When Bob finds out that Sally has been on a date with someone else, he confronts Sally.  Sally may engage in refusal of blame because Bob and Sally had not explicitly noted whether they were mutually exclusive.  The problem with these situations is that the transgressor shows no sensitivity to the offended.  As such, the offended is less apt to exhibit empathy which is key towards forgiveness.  As such, research has shown that refusals tend to aggravate situations, rather than serve as a meaningful repair strategy.&lt;ref name ="Mongeau et al., 1994"&gt;Mongeau et al., 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

====Appeasement/positivity====
Appeasement is used to offset hurtful behavior through the transgressor ingratiating themselves in ways such as promising never to commit the hurtful act or being overly kind to their partner.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  Appeasement may elicit greater empathy from the offended, through soothing strategies exhibited by the transgressor (e.g., complimenting, being more attentive, spending greater time together).  However, the danger of appeasement is the risk that the actions of transgressor will be viewed as being artificial.  For example, sending your partner flowers every day resulting from an infidelity you have committed, may be viewed as downplaying the severity of the transgression if the sending of flowers is not coupled with other soothing strategies that cause greater immediacy.

====Avoidance/evasion====
Avoidance involves the transgressor making conscious efforts to ignore the transgression (also referred to as “silence”).&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  Avoidance can be effective after an apology is sought and forgiveness is granted (i.e., minimizing discussion around unpleasant subjects once closure has been obtained).  However, total avoidance of a transgression where the hurt of the offended is not recognized and forgiveness is not granted can result in further problems in the future.  As relational transgressions tend to develop the nature of the relationship through drawing of new [[Norm (sociology)|rules]]/boundaries, avoidance of a transgression does not allow for this development.  Not surprisingly, avoidance is ineffective as a repair strategy, particularly for instances in which [[infidelity]] has occurred.&lt;ref name="Mongeau et al., 1994"/&gt;

====Relationship talk====
Relationship talk is a remediation strategy that focuses on discussing the transgression in the context of the relationship.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  Aune et al. (1998) identified two types of relationship talk, relationship invocation and metatalk.&lt;ref&gt;Aune et al., 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  '''Relationship invocation''' involves using the relationship as a backdrop for a discussion of the transgression.  For example, “We are too committed to this relationship to let it fail.”, or “Our relationship is so much better than any of my previous relationships.” '''Metatalk''' involves discussing the effect of the transgression on the relationship.  For example, [[infidelity]] may cause partners to redefine [[Norm (sociology)|rules]] of the relationship and reexamine the expectations of commitment each partner expects from the other.

==Summary and application of concepts==
Relational transgressions are a part of any relationship.  In each instance, partners must weigh the severity of the transgression against how much they value the relationship.  In some cases, trust can be so severely damaged that repair strategies are fruitless.  With each transgression both transgressor and victim assume risks.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  The transgressor’s efforts at reconciliation may be rejected by the victim, which results in loss of face and potentially an avenue of attack by the victim.  If the victim offers forgiveness, there is risk that the transgressor may view the forgiveness as a personality trait that may prompt future transgressions (e.g., “I’ll be forgiven by my partner just like every other time”).

These risks aside, promptly engaging in repair strategies helps to ensure the relationship recovers from transgressions.  Addressing relational transgressions can be a very painful process.  Utilizing repair strategies can have a transformative effect on the relationship through redefining [[Norm (sociology)|rules]] and boundaries.  An added benefit can be gained through the closeness that can be realized as partners address transgressions.  Engaging in relationship talk such as metatalk prompts broader discussions about what each partner desires from the relationship and aligns expectations.  Such efforts can mitigate the effects of future transgressions, or even minimize the frequency and severity of transgressions.

'''Sandra Cabrera''' (27 October 1970 – 27 January 2004) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] street-based sex worker, trade unionist, and campaigner for sex worker rights. She was killed in 2004 when her anti-corruption efforts started being successful and threatened police corruption networks and her defense of street workers' rights threatened brothel owners.

Her first contact with [[Association of Women Sex Workers in Argentina in Action for Our Rights|AMMAR]] (Association of Women Prostitutes of Argentina) occurred in 2000, but she didn't begin working with the union until 2001.

{{ quote | text= I was working in a corner of the Terminal area and a group of pimps and bouncers from a bar in the area beat me up pretty badly. I reported that in the media and there the girls from Buenos Aires showed up.

During Argentina's economic crisis in 2001, Cabrera discovered the power of  union association. She complained publicly that the lack of cash had left the women on the street desperately poor, to the point of not knowing if they would have food for their families on Christmas. The Ministry of Social Advancement gave the union sacks of food that Cabrera distributed,&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; working from 8 in the morning to 10 at night.

{{ quote | text= "There were many women who had nothing to eat, so we started to manage food boxes and work plans... At 10:30 pm my daughter and I fell asleep and when I woke up the other day I worried because we had not celebrated Christmas, but she (her daughter Macarena, 7 years old) told me not to worry about it, because thanks to what we had done the day before, many of our companions had something to celebrate.
| author= Sandra Cabrera&lt;ref name="luchadora"/&gt; 
}}

Cabrera seems to have been a devoted mother to the daughter she called "Maca". She encouraged her education and ensured that she learned computer skills. She took her to the theater. At the time of the murder, Macarena was away at a scouting camp in Mendoza.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

Cabrera's work to stop the spread of [[AIDS]] and other STDs began in October, 2001.

{{ quote | text= The word of someone unknown is not the same as one of us talking to our colleagues, with our language, explaining how to take care of ourselves through our experience.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

Lacking resources for its own place, AMMAR's Rosario chapter maintained an office with the Government Workers Association, where the AMMAR women were known affectionately as "the Sanjua gang", after Cabrera's place of origin.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; Cabrera reportedly had a love/hate relationship with AMMAR's national leadership. Her interactions with Elena Reynaga, Secretary General of the union at the time, have been described as "explosive".&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; Reynaga acknowledged that no one she worked with fought her as Cabrera did,

but she also acknowledged Cabrera's effectiveness:

{{ quote 
| text= She cared about the others, the injustices spurred her on, she got what she wanted.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

}}

Organizing gave her a position in a social network that she couldn't get any other way.

{{ quote 
| text= She was very lacking in [i.e. hadn't received] affection, like so many of us. In the organization she began to find something we all seek, to be recognized for something and to be important.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

}}

And in Rosario, she found that recognition.

{{ quote
| text= We admire her strength, how she achieves things for us. It makes us think that if we unite we can aspire to a retirement, to a more dignified life.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;
| author= Rosario sex worker

She was the consummate union organizer. For two years before her murder, she used her motorcycle to take her every place in [[Rosario]] where her colleagues were working the street, listening to their complaints and planning how to use the union to protect them.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; After she died this was how many people remembered her; on her bike, distributing condoms, asking about people's problems.&lt;ref name="frente"/&gt; She learned how to make statements to the news media that the media would pick up and publish, spreading her message.

}}

Perhaps Cabrera's hardest task was just persuading her colleagues that a union was possible. Claudia Lucero, her close friend, sometime dancing partner, godmother of her daughter, and eventual successor as secretary general of the [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] chapter of AMMAR, had to be won over.

{{ quote 
| text= When she proposed it, I did not want to know anything. I told her it was crazy, that it could not be that we had a union, because we had never had anything. Society always had us as the lowest, for me it was like we did not exist. When the crisis came in late 2001, Sandra got social plans. There I started to go to the headquarters of the Central of Argentine Workers (CTA), but still thought that we could not get to where we arrived today. When I started to go, I met all the union guys who treated us differently, they said 'how are you, girls.' There I began to realize that we were not what they had made us believe. Because we suffered so much repression, the police made us believe that we were nobody. There I realized that it was not so.&lt;ref name="frente"/&gt;
| author= Claudia Lucero
}}

Other street workers had other reasons for not joining. Stella Maris Longoni found it easier just to pay her police extortionist fifty pesos a week and be left in peace, until the day she paid and the police arrested her anyway. Released from jail, with police warnings not to join the union still ringing in her ears, she went straight to Cabrera and AMMAR.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

| author= testimony of Rosa Maria Teresa Signorelli }}
During Sandra Cabrera's murder investigation, a source inside the investigation told a news reporter that Cabrera had been defending herself on three fronts: the violence and risk of working on the street, the assaults arranged by the brothel businesses she and her independent street colleagues were competing with, and the harassment and threats from the police whose graft networks she was disrupting.&lt;ref name="olor"/&gt; The corrupt connection between the brothel owners and the police meant that Cabrera's struggle to protect street workers was necessarily a struggle against corruption.

By way of background, the journalist Carlos del Frade has described a meeting in 1991 between Rodolfo Enrique Riegé, Secretary of Public Security for the province of Santa Fe, and Atilio Bléfari, head of police in Rosario. Riegé informed Bléfari that if he didn't increase the graft revenues that he was paying to Riegé, Riegé would relieve him of command and force him to retire. The resulting struggle for control of the city of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] was not a struggle between justice and corruption, but a struggle between a corrupt police officer and his even more corrupt superior. The document that del Frade cites as a source goes on to list the sources of extralegal income the police were collecting, which included theft of goods during transport, bank robbery, car theft, gambling, exploitation of juveniles in nightclubs and discos, and medical quackery, among other things. Category number two was income from the Public Morality units of the police, and included
{{ quote
| text= drug traffickers, drug addicts, prostitutes, exploiters, pimps, nightclubs, discos, motels }}
Since the nightclubs and discos were fronts for brothels, this can be summarized as drugs and prostitution.

As part of her campaign for sex worker rights, Cabrera fought for the elimination of the articles of the provincial Misdemeanor Code that criminalized prostitution.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; Different officers in Rosario's Public Morality unit were able to use the Code to play different sides. Some officers were paid by the brothel owners to enforce the Code against the street workers who were competing with the brothels. Other officers collected bribes from street workers for not enforcing the Code.

Another complication was her romantic involvement with an officer of the Federal police, Diego Parvlucyk. She acted as an informant and he gave her drugs that had been seized during police operations, which she sold. Initially her connection with the Federal police seemed to give her some protection from the provincial police, or at least a feeling of protection, but the relationship with Parvlucyk became more difficult and he was later arrested for her murder, although released and never tried.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; For many of Argentina's sex workers, this relationship didn't seem unusual.

{{ quote
| text= Our colleagues, who are human beings and have feelings, fall in love with the police and pimps.&lt;ref name="miedo"/&gt;
| author= Elena Reynaga }}

From 1999 to 2002, there is record of ten formal complaints made by Cabrera against the police. Most of them involve harassment or threats against her or a colleague.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt;

On March 4, 2003, Marcela Patricia Morelli, a street sex worker and member of AMMAR, filed a complaint against officers of the Ludueña neighborhood police station. She and two trans sex workers had been detained by the officers in what she felt was an excessive manner and with "a humiliating treatment". One of the trans sex workers was released after two hours, but Morelli and the other remained for more than six hours. The police removed money and clothing from the other trans sex worker, humiliated the person, and left the person lying on the floor, naked. In the morning the station chief arrived and told them that he didn't want "male or female prostitutes" in his jurisdiction, and threatened more violent measures. He threatened to drag Morelli by her hair if he saw her again.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt;

As leader of AMMAR's Rosario chapter, Cabrera made the following statements.

| text= We are asking for security. We are fed up with being presented to the merchants of the neighborhoods as sources of insecurity, when many times the presence of prostitutes has avoided robberies.

We know that we are at fault and do not refuse to be delayed by the police in routine checks, but most of us have school-age children and we have already talked to government ministry personnel so we will not be detained in days during the school year, in order to send our children to school.

These things are repeated every time there are changes of leadership in the sections. When we are stopped we do not refuse to show the latest test results for HIV, despite the fact that the National AIDS Act, 23,798, guarantees the confidentiality of those results.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt; 
| author= Sandra Cabrera}}

On September 10, 2003, Cabrera organized a formal complaint against the chief and deputy chief of the Public Morality unit of the police, accusing them of harassing sex workers at the stops near the Rosario Bus Terminal in order to protect brothels in the area from competition from independent street workers. An investigation turned up evidence that they were providing protection for a brothel whose women included underage girls and women trafficked from the Dominican Republic. The complaint also accused police officers of forcing street-based sex workers to pay bribes in order to work. The chief and deputy chief were removed, and the new head of the Public Morality section was a woman, nominally chosen to ensure that the corrupt practices ended,&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; but perhaps in reality chosen to take the pressure off without actually changing anything.&lt;ref name="olor"/&gt; Not quite five months later, when Cabrera was murdered, the disgraced ex-chief of Public Morality had been reassigned as head of the Zavalla police station.

Following the complaint, some of the bars the two police chiefs had been protecting closed, and a few others stopped making payments to the police. One of the sex workers who joined Cabrera in the complaint testified during the murder investigation that Cabrera had expressed fear that the police would retaliate.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt; 

On October 9, someone called the headquarters of the Government Workers Association, where AMMAR kept an office, and said "Tell Sandra that the girl will die before tomorrow." The girl was Cabrera's eight year old daughter, Macarena. From then until shortly before Cabrera's murder, the police Personal Security unit kept a nightly guard on her home.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt;

A few days later, an anonymous complaint filed in the juvenile courts claimed that "Sandra sent the girl to beg and did not go to school." A social worker investigated and confirmed that Macarena had, in fact, been going to school.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt;

On October 17 a sex worker was assaulted by a cyclist who struck her strongly in the head with a chain. The women went to the police and together they searched the area, but her assailant was never found.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt;

At some point, while the police guard was temporarily away from Cabrera's home, someone got in and beat her.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; At another point, two men got into her home, put a gun to the head of her dog, and told her to stop fucking with them.&lt;ref name="aUnAno"/&gt;

The last complaint Cabrera helped file, four days before her murder, involved an officer who charged a woman fifty pesos a week for the privilege of working without trouble from the police. In spite of punctual payments, the woman was arrested by the Public Morality police, who informed her that the officer she was paying was no longer working in that division. When she announced that she was going to join AMMAR, the Morality police threatened her with daily arrests. Cabrera went with her to file an extortion complaint and was with her when she spoke to the news media. Cabrera told a reporter that she was afraid that someone from the Public Morality unit would come back for her.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

During her murder investigation, the investigating judge found evidence of fifteen death threats against her.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt;

I believe that the case would have had another course with more protection.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt;

=== Evidence ===
Testimony indicates that Sandra Cabrera was standing at her usual corner with a colleague at around 4:30 on the morning of 27 January 2004. She was approached by a client and walked toward him, away from her colleague. The colleague never saw the man's face and didn't recognize him. From behind, he appeared to be tall and thin, in light shorts. Cabrera and the client left together to go to her home.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt;

She was found dead from a shot in the back of the neck.&lt;ref name=nswp/&gt; The investigation determined that the muzzle of the gun had been pushed against her neck and the gun was partially supported by her skull when it was fired.

Her body was two blocks from the Omnibus Terminal,&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; one block from the stop where she worked.

There were no scuff marks on her sandals or clothes, indicating that she had not been dragged, but had been killed where she was found.&lt;ref name="zorro"/&gt; The bullet that killed her has been sometimes reported to be a 9 mm,&lt;ref name=nswp/&gt; but news reports at the time of the investigation said the investigators found a .32 caliber slug.&lt;ref name="zorro"/&gt; (Various police departments in Argentina have issued 9 mm handguns to their officers ([[Bersa Thunder 9]]), but the .32 caliber bullet is considered too small for police work.)

Her pants were pulled down below her hips but her underpants were in their normal position. A condom wrapper was found next to her body.&lt;ref name="olor"/&gt;
The police lab found semen in her vaginal and anal cavities.&lt;ref name="marcha"/&gt; Testimony indicated that she had had sex with her lover a couple of hours before she was last seen alive.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt;

Analysis by forensic experts suggests a planned assassination, not a spur-of-the-moment crime of passion. Her killer was probably either familiar with the area, or had cased it ahead of time, and led her to the entry of a private house where they were less likely to be observed. The murder weapon was a small caliber handgun that was easier to hide than the larger handguns issued by police departments. The killer apparently knew how to use a smaller weapon to ensure that Cabrera was killed by one shot, without the need for a second. The forensic analysts believe that he stood behind her, held her head with his left hand, forced the muzzle of the gun against her neck, and fired while standing with his knees slightly flexed. She died instantly.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt;

The forensic report concluded:

{{ quote
| text= The possibility is raised of a killer who has chosen circumstances of time and place, has killed at the right moment of least resistance of the victim, has held the corpse so that it does not strike with suddenness when falling and has left without leaving evidence of his presence. The hypothesis speaks of a professional profile of the victimizer with knowledge in the area, the habits of the victim and the task to be performed. Likewise the neatness of their movements must be considered. This consideration offers the probable alternative that the assailant knew the victim during a previous encounter provoked precisely to obtain data of habits and circumstances in which the victim moved.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt; }}

=== Reaction ===
Her murder was a shock to the national political system. Almost immediately the national Minister of Justice got in touch with the [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]] governor, and the Secretary for National Human Rights came to [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] to get involved in the case. Within two days the investigating judge had convened a multi-disciplinary meeting at the Institute of Forensic Medicine with ten forensic experts; an extraordinary step in any murder case, much less a case involving a street-based sex worker.

The investigating judge laid out three lines of investigation: she was killed by a client, she was killed by the brothel owners, or she was killed by the police.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; At the time, there were no reports of clients committing crimes against prostitutes. Sources in the police department reported that the police were seriously looking into the possibility that she had been killed by someone hired by the brothel owners. Her first encounter with AMMAR occurred when she complained to the media about being assaulted by pimps and bouncers,&lt;ref name="luchadora"/&gt; i.e. by men associated with a bar that was a front for a brothel. The two chiefs of the Public Morality unit who were removed after her complaint were being paid by brothel owners to drive off street sex workers.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; Her struggle against the brothel owners went back many years.

Everyone else assumed it was the police. The police in [[Argentina]] have a history of killing reformers and killing sex workers. A few years earlier, investigators in [[Mar del Plata]] had uncovered a police conspiracy to use a fictional serial killer to cover up the murder of thirty two sex workers,

The [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]] police killed the social activist [[Pocho Lepratti | Claudio Lepratti]] during the disturbances of 2001 when he tried to warn them off from firing at a school where children were eating lunch. At Cabrera's funeral procession, the AMMAR members shouted "We know, we know, that our colleague was killed by the police."&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

Among political insiders and unionists there were two theories about the police. The first was that they killed Cabrera to silence her. The second was that they killed her to warn the new provincial government in [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]] to stop interfering with the graft. Changes of administrations in [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]] had typically been accompanied by some sort of organized criminal action by the police, just to remind everybody of the rules of the game.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; Carlos del Frade relates that during [[Jorge Obeid | Obeid]]'s first administration as governor of [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]], he removed a half dozen police officers who had been involved in state sponsored torture and terrorism. The police responded with a message that if he removed any more police officers, it would break the institutional peace in the province.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt;

The previous administration had responded to Cabrera's complaints by removing high ranking officers for corruption, and the new administration was arresting street level officers for extortion. This second theory implies that Cabrera's killers just wanted to warn off the government from the dangerous experiment of punishing police officers for corruption.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

To show its resolve in moving the case forward, the provincial government quickly appointed a committee of five police officers to investigate. The committee was under the direct orders of José Manuel Maldonado, head of Regional Unit II of the provincial police; in effect, chief of police for the city of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]]. Previously, as head of the Judicial Police, he had been accused of shielding officers involved with the killing of [[Pocho Lepratti | Claudio Lepratti]] and protecting 1st Precinct policemen accused of raping a sixteen year old girl. According to the assistant secretary of the [[Argentine Workers' Central Union | CTA]] (the union federation AMMAR belongs to), Maldonado ensured that proceeds from the payments extorted from sex workers and the money that pimps paid for protection were distributed to officers and politicians appropriately. The unit he currently headed had been linked three years previously to extra-judicial executions and deaths in custody. So he was head of a police unit accused of exactly the type of assassination people were accusing the police of in the Cabrera case, he was believed to be responsible for administering the graft that she had been campaigning against, and he appeared to be experienced in covering up police crimes. The [[Argentine Workers' Central Union | CTA]] and the [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] association of prosecutors demanded his removal.&lt;ref name="zorro"/&gt;

After several months of investigation, the investigating judge ordered the detention of Parvlucyk, the Federal police officer Cabrera had been involved with, and charged him with murder.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; In addition to their troubled relationship, Parvlucyk had stated in his testimony that his immediate superior had asked him to silence Cabrera, and his superior has stated that Parvlucyk always complied with orders.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On appeal, the judge's decision was overturned, and neither Parvlucyk nor anyone else has been tried for Cabrera's murder.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; The panel of judges that overturned the decision of the investigating judge referred to some of the witnesses as ""people with street activities who pass their mornings with a wandering itinerary".&lt;ref name="miedo"/&gt; One of the appeals judges discredited the testimony of over twenty street-based sex workers because they were women who "have an activity that can not be described as good morals," according to the journalist Carlos Del Frade.&lt;ref name="estructural"/&gt; He claims that the possibility that Parvlucyk killed Cabrera because he was ordered to silence her was never properly investigated. Del Frade also claims that the link between Cabrera's murder and the structural corruption in the provincial and Federal police organizations was never investigated.&lt;ref name="estructural"/&gt;

Among the members of AMMAR's [[Rosario, Argentina | Rosario]] chapter, the reaction to Cabrera's murder was a mixture of fear and bravado. "If AMMAR dies, we fatten the pigs," they told each other, and "She paid for everything, and that's why the fight continues."&lt;ref name="explotadores"/&gt; But when Cabrera's friend Claudia Lucero took over as general secretary of the chapter, she found it sometimes difficult to reach out to her colleagues. They warned her, "Don't get involved, you'll end up like Sandra."&lt;ref name="miedo"/&gt; A lawyer who worked for [[Argentine Workers' Central Union | CTA]], the trade union federation that AMMAR is part of, and who represented AMMAR during the murder investigation, said that some of the women who might have testified refused to get involved in the case, and others left [[Santa Fe province]] out of fear.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt; Four years later, Lucero reported similar fear among the street workers.

{{ quote
| text= Fear is present. When I tell you, let's get together, come, they're afraid. I can not tell them we are going to a march or when we are going to do some research work as well. To myself they say "How do you keep going"?&lt;ref name="estructural"/&gt;
| author= Claudia Lucero}}

As for Macarena Cabrera, Sandra's daughter, one can only imagine her reaction to it all. Growing up she had access to the Internet and knew about the failure of the murder investigation and the various theories people proposed. Nine years after the murder she went to the [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] branch of the Government Workers Association, the union that had provided AMMAR Rosario with office space and where her mother had been well known, and told them she really wanted to know what happened to her mother. They were probably able to give her a lot of information, but the source for this says that actual explanations were in short supply.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
=== Influence ===
==== Public Morality police unit ====
If the police were, in fact, trying to send a message to the new provincial administration, it backfired. Cabrera's murder gave the government the political cover it needed to eliminate the Public Morality section of the provincial police. High on the list of her legacies is the fact that two days after her murder, the Santa Fe Minister of Government announced that the Public Morality section would be dissolved and the officers that served in it would be distributed among different units. He said that the move had been under consideration since the beginning of the new administration:

{{ quote
| text= ... because it is an obsolete unit that allows a certain degree of corruption, without passing judgment on the officers that served in it.
| author= Alberto Gianneschi, Minister of Government in Santa Fe province at the time of Sandra Cabrera's murder

But he acknowledged that he was making the announcement in the context of Cabrera's murder.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Misdemeanor Code ====
On the other hand, the government wanted to amend, rather than repeal, the articles of the Misdemeanor Code that criminalized sex work and transgenderism. The political opposition favored straight repeal, but the government was concerned about voter reaction and opposition from the Church.&lt;ref name="explotadores"/&gt; As the Minister of Government put it with Victorian sensibility:

{{ quote
| text= We are looking for a balance between the claims of the defense of modesty and scandalous prostitution through a new bill.
| author= Alberto Gianneschi&lt;ref name="noticia"/&gt;
}}

As the new secretary general of AMMAR's [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] chapter, Claudia Lucero continued the campaign to repeal the articles.

{{ quote
| text= "The contravention codes are not repealed. The situation is the same, the only thing that changed is that there is no more Public Morality, but there are the precincts, there is the command [police unit], the police are still chasing us. After Sandra's death, a month later, we had a partner in Baigorria who was threatened and beaten. The harassment continues, the mobile units stop us, some police come and say 'you have to go because the neighbor says' and that is a lie. They make it up so that the sex worker gives them money and they let her work. The commands are in the red zone and that's because the codes are not repealed and the police still have power.&lt;ref name="estructural"/&gt;
| author= Claudia Lucero }}

For AMMAR [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], the campaign was an important rallying point. The constant police harassment intimidated the women in the street, but it also gave them strong motivation to take steps, however risky, to join the campaign against laws that legitimized the harassment. And since the campaign had been Cabrera's initiative, it gave the union frequent opportunity to invoke the name of Sandra Cabrera, who had become an important symbol for sex workers' rights.

{{ quote
| text= I said when Sandra passed, let's try to continue because otherwise everything is dying. And that is the commitment and at the same time persuades me that the death of Sandra was not in vain, beyond that we do not have justice. But it was not in vain, because we followed the path she left us. The day that the codes are repealed will not be our achievement, that's the way Sandra prepared us, so the achievement will be hers.&lt;ref name="estructural"/&gt;
| author= Claudia Lucero }}

Finally, in 2010, after years of lobbying and activism by AMMAR [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], a different administration repealed the articles of the law that Cabrera had campaigned against.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
While she didn't live to see the victory, she was part of the fight, and it was a more fundamental restructuring of society's relationship with sex work than eliminating a police unit.

==== Rosario ====
Walter Miranda, who had been removed as chief of the Public Morality unit following Cabrera's complaint because he had been providing protection to brothels that trafficked underage girls and foreign women, as well as extorting bribes from street-based sex workers, continued to advance through the ranks. By 2012 he had become head of Regional Unit II, which gave him control of all provincial police forces in the city of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]]. The brothels in the area around the bus terminal that he had been protecting were still there. During an investigation of trafficking in humans, a phone tap of one of the brothel owners recorded the owner asking how to go about selling cocaine. The answer was that he should bribe Hugo Tognoli, the highest ranking police officer in the province of [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]]. Laura Cosido, a judge in the Federal Chamber of Rosario, stated that "There was never such an open relationship between narcos and police." AMMAR, Cabrera's union, complained that the drug and human trafficking networks were the same.

Around the same time, Claudia Lucero was complaining that in spite of the revocation of the articles of the Misdemeanor Code that criminalized street prostitution, the police were still finding ways to extort money from street workers.

Shortly thereafter, sex work in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] went through the same change in law and enforcement that the rest of Argentina experienced. The anti-trafficking law, passed a few years earlier, began to be enforced consistently, ending the legal regulation of brothels by municipalities. One of the last cabarets in Rosario was closed when city inspectors found an entertainer performing oral sex on a customer. Announcing that they were closing the place, the inspectors were attacked by the madame and the female employees, who threw glasses and punched and kicked the inspectors. Driven into the street, they took refuge in a local bar where the women found them and again attacked, throwing and breaking tables and stealing the tape used to officially seal a closed business. Not everyone in Argentina embraced the new anti-trafficking regime.

Some of the women who had worked in the cabarets and ''whiskerías'' that fronted for brothels moved to private apartments operated by the same type of people who had operated the brothels.

The motels that once rented to independent sex workers now turn them away in order to avoid problems with the city. In response, some of the women have organized ''casitas'', where a group of women rent a house and set aside a part of the earnings from each client session to cover the rent. Basically, women who were previously working in brothels are still working in brothels, and women who were previously independent are still independent. Georgina Orellano, secretary general of AMMAR as of 2017, says of the new legal regime that "It took all the activity to a much darker and hidden place."&lt;ref name="sombra"/&gt;

For the street based workers, Orellano says that since Mauricio Macri became Argentina's president, institutional violence has increased in public spaces.

| text=  We suffer more searches, more humiliation, more payment of fines and the difficulty of making use of the street. Lately, there are reports that the police drive the girls away, beat them, do not let them work, ask them for sexual favors and ask for money.&lt;ref name="sombra"/&gt;
| author= Georgina Orellano
}}

Orellano says that the new prohibitionist regime recognizes only victims and pimps, and criminalizes women who enter sex work voluntarily. The current municipal law on sex work in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], passed in 2013, mentions assistance and support; Orellano says that the city department responsible for implementing the assistance has helped so few women that they can be counted on the fingers of the two hands. AMMAR's last survey found one hundred women working the streets in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], and it is estimated that another six hundred are working indoors.&lt;ref name="sombra"/&gt;

The legal and police system that Sandra Cabrera struggled with has changed. Where it once tolerated brothels it has become prohibitionist. The laws that once referred to street based sex work as "scandalous" and an "offense to modesty"&lt;ref name="proyecto"/&gt; now speak of assisting sex workers. The owners of regulated brothels who once assaulted independent sex workers in the streets, or paid the police to do the same, now operate illegally in private apartments, driven underground by the prohibitionist movement that currently opposes AMMAR in the media and the legislatures. The political projects of Cabrera and AMMAR's founders have been challenged by new social forces with different concepts of sex worker rights and agency. And yet street based sex workers face the same problems, including police violence and extortion. Perhaps Cabrera's most important legacy is illustrated by a little story told by Claudia Lucero a year after Cabrera's death:

{{ quote
| text= A short while ago the Command [Radio Command, a police unit] wanted to take bribes from a member [of AMMAR], and it turns out that she is unionized. She told them to take her prisoner, but she would call her lawyer as soon as she got to the police station because she had that right. The cops wanted to arrange something, give them money, or go to jail. But when she told them that, they dropped her at a corner and left.&lt;ref name="frente"/&gt;

=== Recognition ===
Nine days after Cabrera's murder, marches were held in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], [[Buenos Aires]], and [[Salta province]], demanding justice and sex workers rights. The counts of participants weren't given for the marches, but the [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] march was described as "multitudinous" and included a cross section of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] civic society, including leaders of political parties, unions, and human rights groups.

'''School bullying''' is a type of [[bullying]] that occurs in any [[learning space|educational setting]].

For an act to be considered bullying it must meet certain criteria. This includes hostile intent, imbalance of power, repetition, distress, and provocation. Bullying can have a wide spectrum of effects on a student including anger, depression, stress and suicide. Additionally, the bully can develop different social disorders or have a higher chance of engaging in criminal activity.

If there is suspicion that a child is being bullied or is a bully, there are warning signs in their behavior. There are many programs and organizations worldwide which provide bullying prevention services or information on how children can cope if they have been bullied.

== Definition ==
There is no universal definition of school bullying; however, it is widely agreed that bullying is a subcategory of [[aggressive behavior]] characterized by the following three minimum criteria:&lt;ref name="Burger 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burger |first=Christoph |last2=Strohmeier |first2=Dagmar |last3=Spröber |first3=Nina |last4=Bauman |first4=Sheri |last5=Rigby |first5=Ken |date=2015 |title=How teachers respond to school bullying: An examination of self-reported intervention strategy use, moderator effects, and concurrent use of multiple strategies |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sheri_Bauman/publication/282641314_How_teachers_respond_to_school_bullying_An_examination_of_self-reported_intervention_strategy_use_moderator_effects_and_concurrent_use_of_multiple_strategies/links/56277c7808aefb81befbab5d.pdf |journal=Teaching and Teacher Education |volume=51 |pages=191–202 |doi=10.1016/j.tate.2015.07.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*hostile intent (i.e., the harm caused by bullying is deliberate, not accidental),&lt;ref name="Goldsmid_and_Howie"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldsmid |first1=S. |last2=Howie |first2=P. |year=2014 |title=Bullying by definition: An examination of definitional components of bullying |url= |journal=Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=210–225 |doi=10.1080/13632752.2013.844414}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*imbalance of power (i.e., bullying includes a real or perceived power inequity between the bully and the victim),&lt;ref name="Goldsmid_and_Howie"/&gt; and
*repetition over a period of time (i.e., more than once with the potential to occur multiple times).&lt;ref name="Goldsmid_and_Howie"/&gt;

The following two additional criteria have been proposed to complement the above-mentioned criteria:
* victim distress (victim suffers mild to severe psychological, social or physical trauma)&lt;ref name="Goldsmid_and_Howie"/&gt; and
* provocation (bullying is motivated by perceived benefits of their aggressive behaviors).&lt;ref name="Goldsmid_and_Howie"/&gt;

Some of these characteristics have been disputed (e.g., for power imbalance: bullies and victims often report that conflicts occur between two equals); nevertheless, they remain widely established in the scientific literature.&lt;ref name="Burger 2015"/&gt;

== Underlying causes ==
The underlying causes of school violence and bullying include gender and social norms and wider contextual and structural factors.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002469/246970e.pdf |title=School Violence and Bullying: Global Status Report |last=UNESCO |first= |publisher=Paris, UNESCO |year=2017 |isbn=978-92-3-100197-0 |location= |pages=17, 29, 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discriminatory [[Gender role|gender norms]] that shape the dominance of men and the subservience of women and the perpetuation of these norms through violence are found in some form in many cultures. [[Gender inequality]] and the prevalence of [[violence against women]] in society exacerbate the problem. Similarly, social norms that support the authority of teachers over children may legitimise the use of violence to maintain discipline and control.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The pressure to conform to dominant gender norms is also high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Meyer |first=Doug |date= |title=The Disregarding of Heteronormativity: Emphasizing a Happy Queer Adulthood and Localizing Anti-Queer Violence to Adolescent Schools |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13178-016-0272-7 |journal=Sexuality Research &amp; Social Policy |volume=14 |issue=3 |page=331 |via= |doi=10.1007/s13178-016-0272-7 |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young people who cannot or who choose not to conform to these norms are often punished for this through violence and bullying at school.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Schools themselves can "teach" children to be violent through discriminatory practices, curricula and textbooks. If unchecked, gender discrimination and power imbalances in schools can encourage attitudes and practices that subjugate children, uphold unequal gender norms and tolerate violence, including corporal punishment.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Some attribute part of the cause of bullying to the [[Bullying culture|atmosphere]] in which it occurs. Thornberg and Knutsen state in their study, "School attributing refers to attributing the cause of bullying to the school setting." They say that school attributing has two subcategories which are "boredom in school" and "poor antibullying practices". Boredom in school involves a student who does not have anything else to do other than bully. Poor antibullying practices may include teachers and staff not caring enough to intervene, or a school not having enough teachers for students. This may lead to the students feeling unwanted or unimportant due to the lack of care from the school's staff.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Thornberg, Robert, and Sven Knutsen |title=Teenagers' Explanations of Bullying |journal=Child &amp; Youth Care Forum |volume=40 |issue=3 |page=177 |doi=10.1007/s10566-010-9129-z |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools and the education system also operate within the context of wider social and structural factors and may reflect and reproduce environments that do not protect children and adolescents from violence and bullying. For example, physical and sexual violence may be more prevalent in schools in contexts where it is also more prevalent in wider society. Studies suggest that sexual violence and harassment of girls is worse in schools where other forms of violence are prevalent, and in conflict and emergency contexts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002321/232107E.pdf School-related gender-based violence is preventing the achievement of quality education for all]. UNESCO Policy Paper 17 (March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[Gang|gang violence]] is more common in schools where gangs, weapons and drugs are part of the local culture.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In their paper "Predicting Bullying: Exploring the Contributions of Childhood Negative Life Experiences in Predicting Adolescent Bullying Behavior," Connell, Morris and Piquero identify three primary aspects of a child's life- family, school and peers- as major indicators to whether or not that child exhibits behavior akin to bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Connell |first=Nadine M. |last2=Morris |first2=Robert G. |last3=Piquero |first3=Alex R. |date=July 2016 |title=Predicting Bullying: Exploring the Contributions of Childhood Negative Life Experiences in Predicting Adolescent Bullying Behavior |journal=International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology |volume=60 |issue=9 |pages=1082–1096 |doi=10.1177/0306624X15573760 |issn=1552-6933 |pmid=25759430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention ==
Bullying can threaten students' physical and emotional safety at school and can negatively impact their ability to learn. The best way to address bullying is to stop it before it starts. There are many different groups that can intervene to address bullying (and cyberbullying) in schools: parents, teachers, and school leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Morgan |first=H |title=Malicious Use of Technology: What Schools, Parents, and Teachers Can Do to Prevent Cyberbullying |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00094056.2013.792636 |journal=Childhood Education |volume=89 |pages=146–151 |via=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly used strategies by teachers to prevent it are to communicate, mediate and seek help.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Giménez-Gualdo |first=Ana-M. |last2=Arnaiz-Sánchez |first2=Pilar |last3=Cerezo-Ramírez |first3=Fuensanta |last4=Prodócimo |first4=Elaine |date=2018-07-01 |title=Teachers' and students' perception about cyberbullying. Intervention and coping strategies in primary and secondary education |url=https://doi.org/10.3916/C56-2018-03 |journal=Comunicar |language=es |volume=26 |issue=56 |doi=10.3916/c56-2018-03 |issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training school staff and students to prevent and address bullying can help sustain bullying prevention efforts over time. There are no federal mandates for bullying curricula or staff training. In addition to addressing bullying before it occurs, a great prevention strategy is to educate the students on bullying.&lt;ref name="US Govt"/&gt;

Examples of activities to teach about bullying include:

* Internet or library research, such as looking up types of bullying, how to prevent it, and how kids should respond
* Presentations, such as a speech or role-play on stopping bullying
* Discussions about topics like reporting bullying
* Creative writing, such as a poem speaking out against bullying or a story or skit teaching bystanders how to help
* Artistic works, such as a collage about respect or the effects of bullying
* Classroom meetings to talk about peer relations&lt;ref name="US Govt"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.stopbullying.gov/prevention/at-school/index.html |title=Prevention at School |date=2012-02-29 |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|access-date=2018-04-26}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
A victim, in the short term, may feel [[Depression (mood)|depressed]], anxious, angry, have [[Stress (psychological)|excessive stress]], [[learned helplessness]], feel as though their life has fallen apart, have a significant drop in school performance, or may commit [[suicide]] ([[bullycide]]). In the long term, they may feel [[Emotional security|insecure]], lack [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], exhibit extreme sensitivity ([[hypervigilance|hypervigilant]]), or develop a mental illness such as [[psychopathy]], [[avoidant personality disorder]] or [[PTSD]].  They may also desire [[Revenge|vengeance]], sometimes leading them to torment others in return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Dombeck, Mark |title=The Long Term Effects of Bullying |url=https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/the-long-term-effects-of-bullying/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anxiety, depression and psychosomatic symptoms are common among both bullies and their victims. Among these participants alcohol and substance abuse are commonly seen later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=KALTIALA HEINO |first=RIITTAKERTTU |last2=RIMPELÄ |first2=MATTI |last3=RANTANEN |first3=PÄIVI |last4=RIMPELÄ |first4=ARJA |date=1 December 2000 |title=Bullying at school—an indicator of adolescents at risk for mental disorders |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140197100903518 |journal=Journal of Adolescence |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=661–674 |doi=10.1006/jado.2000.0351}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that people suffering from depression feel much better when they talk to others about it, but victims of bullying fear may not talk to others about their feelings in fear of being bullied, which can worsen their depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Olweus |first1=D |title=Bullying at school |date=1993 |publisher=Malden, MA |accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the short term, being a bystander "can produce feelings of anger, fear, guilt, and sadness.... Bystanders who witness repeated victimizations of peers can experience negative effects similar to the victimized children themselves."&lt;ref name="Hirsch, L. 2012" /&gt;

While most bullies, in the long term, grow up to be emotionally functional adults, many have an increased risk of developing [[antisocial personality disorder]], which is linked to an increased risk of committing criminal acts (including [[domestic violence]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Long-Term Effects Of Bullying: Pain Lasts Into Adulthood (STUDY) |work=Huffington Post |accessdate=15 April 2014 |date=20 February 2013 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/20/long-term-effects-of-bullying_n_2728190.html |author=Pappas, Stephanie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Negative impact on educational quality and outcomes ===
The educational effects on victims of school violence and bullying are significant. Violence and bullying at the hands of teachers or other students may make children and adolescents afraid to go to school and interfere with their ability to concentrate in class or participate in school activities. It can also have similar effects on bystanders.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The consequences include missing classes, avoiding school activities, playing truant or dropping out of school altogether. This in turn has an adverse impact on academic achievement and attainment and on future education and employment prospects. Children and adolescents who are victims of violence may achieve lower grades and may be less likely to anticipate going on to higher education. Analyses of international learning assessments highlight the impact of bullying on learning outcomes. These analyses clearly show that bullying reduces students' achievement in key subjects, such as mathematics, and other studies have documented the negative impact of school violence and bullying on educational performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=24298004 |year=2014 |author1=Devries |first1=K. M |title=School violence, mental health, and educational performance in Uganda |journal=Pediatrics |volume=133 |issue=1 |pages=e129–37 |last2=Child |first2=J. C |last3=Allen |first3=E |last4=Walakira |first4=E |last5=Parkes |first5=J |last6=Naker |first6=D |doi=10.1542/peds.2013-2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Bystanders and the school climate as a whole are also affected by school violence and bullying. Unsafe learning environments create a climate of fear and insecurity and a perception that teachers do not have control or do not care about the students, and this reduces the quality of education for all.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Social and economic costs ===
The 2006 UN World Report on Violence against Children shows that victims of corporal punishment, both at school and at home, may develop into adults who are passive and over-cautious or aggressive. Involvement in school bullying can be a predictor of future antisocial and criminal behaviour. Being bullied is also linked to a heightened risk of eating disorders and social and relationship difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF (2014). [https://www.unicef.org/publications/index_74865.html Hidden in plain sight: A statistical analysis of violence against children]. {{ISBN|978-92-806-4767-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Other studies have shown the longer-term effects of bullying at school. One study of all children born in England, Scotland and Wales during one week in 1958 analyzes data on 7,771 children who had been bullied at ages 7 and 11. At age 50, those who had been bullied as children were less likely to have obtained school qualifications and less likely to live with a spouse or partner or to have adequate social support. They also had lower scores on word memory tests designed to measure cognitive IQ even when their childhood intelligence levels were taken into account and, more often reported, that they had poor health. The effects of bullying were visible nearly four decades later, with health, social and economic consequences lasting well into adulthood. For children, "peers are a much more important influence than has been realised. It is a terrible thing to be excluded by your peers".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Rebecca (18 April 2014). [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/children/10772302/Bullying-at-school-affects-health-40-years-later.html Bullying at school affects health 40 years later]. Telegraph. Retrieved on 2017-10-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The economic impact of violence against children and adolescents is substantial.&lt;ref&gt;WHO (2016). Inspire. Seven strategies for ending violence against children.&lt;/ref&gt; Youth violence in Brazil alone is estimated to cost nearly US$19 billion every year, of which US$943 million can be linked to violence in schools. The estimated cost to the economy in the USA of violence associated with schools is US$7.9 billion a year.&lt;ref&gt;Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children (2012). Tackling violence in schools: A global perspective bridging the gap between standards and practice.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Analytic work supported by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) shows that school-related gender-based violence alone can be associated with the loss of one primary grade of schooling, which translates to an annual cost of around US$17 billion to low- and middle-income countries.&lt;ref&gt;RTI International. (2015). [http://www.ungei.org/resources/6089.htm What is the cost of school-related gender-based violence?] USAID.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In the East Asia and Pacific region, it is estimated that the economic costs of just some of the health consequences of child maltreatment were equivalent to between 1.4% and 2.5% of the region's annual GDP.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In Argentina, the forgone benefit to society from overall early school dropout is 11.4% of GDP, and in Egypt, nearly 7% of potential earnings is lost as a result of the number of children dropping out of school.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A study has shown that each year Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria lose US$974 million, US$301 million and US$1,662 million respectively for failing to educate girls to the same standard as boys, and violence in school is one of the key factors contributing to the under-representation of girls in education.&lt;ref&gt;Plan (2008).

=== Bullies ===
Proactive aggression is a behavior that expects a reward.  With bullying each individual has a role to defend.{{clarify|date=October 2016}} Some children act proactively but will show aggression to defend themselves if provoked.  These children will react aggressively but tend to never be the ones to attack first.

There have been two subtypes created in bully classification; popular aggressive and unpopular aggressive. Popular aggressive bullies are social and do not encounter a great deal of social stigma from their aggression. Unpopular aggressive bullies, however, are most often rejected by other students and use aggression to seek attention.&lt;ref name="Sign In"/&gt;
* In a recent national survey 3,708,284 students reported being a perpetrator of bullying in the U.S. school system.&lt;ref name="Sign In"/&gt;
* Studies have shown bullies actually report more success in making friends than other children.
* Bullying behavior in perpatrators is shown to decrease with age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dake |first=Joseph A. |last2=Price |first2=James H. |last3=Telljohann |first3=Susan K. |date=1 May 2003 |title=The Nature and Extent of Bullying at School |journal=Journal of School Health |volume=73 |issue=5 |pages=173–180 |doi=10.1111/j.1746-1561.2003.tb03599.x |pmid=12793102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey by the [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] (NICHD), students were asked to complete a questionnaire.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A total of 10.6% of the children replied that they had sometimes bullied other children, a response category defined as moderate bullying. An additional 8.8% said they had bullied others once a week or more, defined as frequent bullying. Similarly, 8.5% said they had been targets of moderate bullying, and 8.4% said they were bullied frequently. Out of all the students, 13% said they had engaged in moderate or frequent bullying of others, while 10.6% said they had been bullied either moderately or frequently. Some students — 6.3% — had both bullied others and been bullied themselves. In all, 29% of the students who responded to the survey had been involved in some aspect of bullying, either as a bully, as the target of bullying or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=NIH |title=Bullying Widespread in U.S. Schools, Survey Finds |work=NICHD Archive |date=26 June 2006 |url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/news/releases/pages/bullying.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Tara Kuther, an associate professor of psychology at [[Western Connecticut State University]], "...bullying gets so much more sophisticated and subtle in high school. It's more [[relational aggression|relational]]. It becomes more difficult for teens to know when to intervene; whereas with younger kids, bullying is more physical and, therefore, more clear-cut."&lt;ref name="greatschools.org" /&gt;

== Types of bullying ==
There are four basic types of bullying: verbal, physical, psychological, and cyber. Cyberbullying is becoming one of the most common types. While victims can experience bullying at any age, it is witnessed most often in school-aged children.

Direct bullying is a relatively open attack on a victim that is physical and/or verbal in nature.&lt;ref name="Hirsch, L. 2012"&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Weinstein Books |isbn=978-1-60286-184-8 |oclc=792879631 |last1=Hirsch |first1=Lee |last2=Lowen |first2=Cynthia |last3=Santorelli |first3=Dina |title=Bully: An action plan for teachers and parents to combat the bullying crisis |location=New York |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect bullying is more subtle and harder to detect, but involves one or more forms of relational aggression, including [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|social isolation]] via intentional exclusion, spreading rumors to defame one's character or reputation, making faces or obscene gestures behind someone's back, and manipulating friendships or other relationships.&lt;ref name="Hirsch, L. 2012" /&gt;

Pack bullying is bullying undertaken by a group. The 2009 Wesley Report on bullying found that pack bullying was more prominent in high schools and lasted longer than bullying undertaken by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facts About School Bullies and Bullying Behaviors |work=Bullying Statistics |url=http://www.bullyingstatistics.org/content/school-bullying.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical bullying is any unwanted physical contact between the bully and the victim. This is one of the most easily identifiable forms of bullying. Examples include:&lt;ref name="stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220222902/http://stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov/index.asp?area=whatbullyingis | archive-date=20 February 2009 |url=http://stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov/index.asp?area=whatbullyingis |title=So what is bullying? |work=Stop Bullying Now!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bolton"&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Boys Town Press |isbn=978-1-889322-67-4 |author1=Bolton, José |author2=Graeve, Stan |title=No room for bullies: from the classroom to cyberspace |location=Nebraska |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotional ===
{{See also|Psychological abuse}}
Emotional bullying is any form of bullying that causes damage to a victim's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and/or [[emotional well-being]]. Examples include:&lt;ref name="stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bolton" /&gt;

* Spreading malicious [[rumor]]s about people
* Getting certain people to "gang up" on others (this could also be considered physical bullying)
* Ignoring people on purpose (via the [[silent treatment]] or pretending the victim is non-existent)
* Provoking others
* Belittling, making fun of people, or saying hurtful things (which are also forms of verbal bullying)&lt;ref name=belittling&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccpa-accp.ca/blog/?p=3021 |title=The Effects of Belittling |publisher=Counselling Connect |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Verbal ===
{{See also|Verbal abuse}}
Verbal bullying is any slanderous statements or accusations that cause the victim undue emotional distress. Examples include:&lt;ref name="Bolton" /&gt;

* Directing foul language ([[profanity]]) at the target
* Using [[derogatory]] terms or deriding the person's name
* Commenting negatively on someone's looks, clothes, body, etc. ([[personal abuse]])
* [[Suffering|Tormenting]]
* [[harassment|Harassing]]
* Mocking and belittling&lt;ref name="belittling" /&gt;

*Taunting&lt;ref name="stopbullying.gov"/&gt;
*Teasing&lt;ref name="stopbullying.gov"/&gt;
*Inappropriate sexual comments&lt;ref name="stopbullying.gov"/&gt;

=== Cyberbullying ===
Cyberbullying is the quickest growing form of harassment of school campuses in the U.S. and 40% of adolescent report being a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hvidston |first=David |date= |title=Cyberbullying: Implications for Principal Leadership |url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0192636513504452 |journal=NASSP Bulletin |volume=97 |pages=297–313 |via=Sage Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most definitions of cyberbullying come from definitions of school bullying. Thus, this conduct is often described as an intentional aggressive behavior that takes place via new technologies, during which groups or individuals hurt classmates who cannot easily defend themselves. Cyberbullying events can occur via cellphones or computers, by means of text messages, e-mails, online social networks, chatrooms or blogs.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2015-02-01 |title=Does cyberbullying overlap with school bullying when taking modality of involvement into account? |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074756321400572X |journal=Computers in Human Behavior  |volume=43 |pages=49–57 |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.10.049 |issn=0747-5632}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of bullying can easily go undetected because of the lack of parental or authoritative supervision. Because bullies can pose as someone else, it is the most anonymous form of bullying. Like the bullying that occurs in school, the following four profiles have been identified: cyberneutral, cyberbully, cybervictim and cyberbully-victim.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; Many who are bullied in school are likely to be bullied over the Internet and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Bolton" /&gt;  Since students have become more reliant on internet, the advancement in social media and technology has altered the fear of in-person bullying away from schoolyards but has rather increase cyberbullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kowalski, R.

Cyberbullying can happen 24 hours a day and seven days a week and reach a child even when they are alone.
Deleting inappropriate or harassing messages, texts or pictures is extremely difficult after being posted or sent.&lt;ref&gt;stopbullying.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prevention ====
According to the website Stop Cyberbullying, "When schools try and get involved by disciplining the student for cyberbullying actions that took place off campus and outside of school hours, they are often sued for exceeding their authority and violating the student's free speech right." &lt;ref name="Stop Cyberbullying"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is cyberbullying, exactly? |url=http://stopcyberbullying.org/what_is_cyberbullying_exactly.html |publisher=Stop cyberbullying |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest for schools to make revisions to their policies that would allow for disciplinary actions to take place even if off campus or after hours. They say if the act is likely to affect a student mentally or physically while in school then the revision of the policy would allow for the staff to intervene without violating the student's constitutional rights. Many principals are hesitant to act because school discipline codes and states laws do not define cyberbullying. According to professor Bernard James, "educators are empowered to maintain safe schools, the timidity of educators in this context of emerging technology is working in advantage of the bullies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/28/style/28bully.html |title=How Should Schools Handle Cyberbullying? |last=Hoffman |first=Jan |date=2010-06-27 |work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-20 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberbullying has become extremely prevalent; 95% of teens who use [[social media]] reported having witnessed malicious behavior on social media from 2009 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boschert |first=Sherry |title=Cyberbullying triples suicide risk in teens |work=Pediatric News |url=http://www.pediatricnews.com/specialty-focus/mental-health/single-article-page/cyberbullying-triples-suicide-risk-in-teens.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As sites like [[Facebook]] or [[Twitter]] offer no routine monitoring, children from a young age must learn proper internet behavior, say Abraham Foxman and Cyndi Silverman. "This is a call for parents and educators to teach these modern skills... through awareness and advocacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Social Networking Sites Can Be Forums for Cyberbullying |work=Opposing Viewpoints in Context |url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/ovic/ViewpointsDetailsPage/DocumentToolsPortletWindow?displayGroupName=Viewpoints&amp;jsid=338bbf8461b0eccf737c3bc28daee63f&amp;action=2&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CEJ3010744205&amp;u=plan_smcol&amp;zid=9df104e26321ef3abe1a4c867b490850}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per Scott Eidler, "Parents and educators need to make children aware at a young age of the life-changing effects cyberbullying can have on the victim. The next step for prevention is advocacy. For example, three high school students from [[Melville, New York]] organized a Bullying Awareness Walk, where several hundred people turned out to show their support."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Eidler |first=Scott |title=Anti-bullying walk held in North Hempstead |work=Newsday |accessdate=21 September 2013 |date=6 March 2013 |url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/anti-bullying-walk-held-in-north-hempstead-1.5022005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clara Wajngurt writes, "Other than organizing events, calling for social media sites to take charge could make the difference between life and death. Cyberbullying is making it increasingly difficult to enforce any form of prevention."&lt;ref name="wajngurt"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wajngurt |first=Clara |title=Anti-Bullying Policies in Higher Ed |url=http://www.niot.org/node/7125 |publisher=Not in Our Town |accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joanna Wojcik concludes, "The rapid growth of social media is aiding the spread of cyberbullying, and prevention policies are struggling to keep up. In order for prevention policies to be put in place, the definition of cyberbullying must be stated, others must be educated on how to recognize and prevent bullying, and policies that have already attempted to be enacted need to be reviewed and learned from."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wojcik |first=Joanne |title=Cyber bullying cases test schools' legal reach |work=Business Insurance |date=4 March 2012 |url=http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20120304/NEWS05/303049991}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher Charisse Nixon found that students do not reach out for help with cyberbullying for four main reasons: they do not feel connected to the adults around them; the students do not see the cyberbullying as an issue that is worth bringing forward; they do not feel the surrounding adults have the ability to properly deal with the cyberbullying; and the teenagers have increased feelings of shame and humiliation regarding the cyberbullying.&lt;ref name="Adolescent Health 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2147/AHMT.S36456 |volume=5 |pages=143–158 |last=Nixon |first=Charisse L |title=Current perspectives: the impact of cyberbullying on adolescent health |journal=Adolescent Health, Medicine and Therapeutics |date=1 July 2014 |pmid=25177157 |pmc=4126576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon also found that when bystanders took action in helping end the cyberbullying in adolescents, the results were more positive than when the adolescents attempted to resolve the situation without outside help.&lt;ref name="Adolescent Health 2014"/&gt;

=== Sexual bullying ===
{{Main|Sexual bullying}}
Sexual bullying is "any bullying behavior, whether physical or non-physical, that is based on a person's sexuality or gender. It is when sexuality or gender is used as a weapon by boys or girls towards other boys or girls—although it is more commonly directed at girls. It can be carried out to a person's face, behind their back or [[Cyber-bullying|through the use of technology]]."&lt;ref name="NSPCC02"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/resourcesforteachers/classroomresources/sexual_bullying_definition_wdf68769.pdf |title=NSPCC working definition of Sexual Bullying |publisher=[[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] |accessdate=22 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613025646/http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/resourcesforteachers/classroomresources/sexual_bullying_definition_wdf68769.pdf | archive-date=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its research into sexual bullying in schools, the [[BBC]] TV series ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' commissioned a questionnaire aimed at people aged 11 to 19 in schools and youth clubs across five regions of [[England]].&lt;ref name="BBC01"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_7811000/7811468.stm |title=Rising problem of sexual bullying in schools |publisher=BBC [[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]] |date=5 January 2009 |accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey revealed that of the 273 respondents, 28 had been forced to do something sexual, and 31 had seen it happen to someone else. Of the 273 respondents, 40 had experienced unwanted touching.&lt;ref name="NSPCC01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/research/questions/sexual_bullying_wda70106.html |title=What is sexual bullying, and how can I manage it within educational settings? |publisher=NSPCC |accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.K. government figures show that in the 2007–2008 school year, there were 3,450 fixed-period exclusions and 120 expulsions from schools in England due to sexual misconduct.&lt;ref name="DCSF01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000860/index.shtml |title=Permanent and Fixed Period Exclusions from Schools in England 2007/08 |publisher=UK Government's [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] |date=30 July 2009 |accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included incidents such as [[groping]] and using sexually insulting language. From April 2008 to March 2009, [[ChildLine]] counselled a total of 156,729 children, 26,134 of whom spoke about bullying as a main concern and 300 of whom spoke specifically about sexual bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/policyandpublicaffairs/policysummaries/sexual_bullying_in_education_settings_wdf68771.pdf |title=NSPCC policy summary |publisher=NSPCC |accessdate=22 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613025631/http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/policyandpublicaffairs/policysummaries/sexual_bullying_in_education_settings_wdf68771.pdf | archive-date=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.K. charity [[Beatbullying]] has claimed that as [[gang culture]] enters, children are being bullied into providing sexual favours in exchange for protection.&lt;ref name="BBC02"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6500005.stm |title=Girls bullied for 'sex favours' |publisher=BBC |date=27 March 2007 |accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other anti-bullying groups and teachers' unions, including the [[National Union of Teachers]], challenged the charity to provide evidence of this.&lt;ref name="BBC02" /&gt;

Sexting cases are also on the rise and have become a major source of bullying. The circulation of explicit photos of those involved either around school or the internet put the originators in a position to be scorned and bullied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eyepat.org/sexting |title=Sexting |publisher=EyePAT |date= |accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been reports of some cases in which the bullying has been so extensive that the victim has taken their life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hastings |first=Katy |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1161112/Teenager-commits-suicide-sexting-nude-photo-boyfriend-life-misery.html |title=Teenager commits suicide after 'sexting' a nude photo to her boyfriend made her life a misery |work=Daily Mail |date=10 March 2009 |accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Higher education bullying ===
According to HealthDay News, 15 percent of college students claim to have been victims of bullying while at college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=King |first1=Michelle |title=The Truth About Bullying in College |url=http://www.hercampus.com/health/mental-health/truth-about-bullying-college |website=HerCampus.com |accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the article, "Bullying not a thing of the past for college students," Kaitlyn Krasselt writes, "Bullying comes in all forms but is usually thought of as a K-12 issue that ceases to exist once students head off to college."&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{cite web |last1=Krasselt |first1=Kaitlyn |title=Bullying not a thing of the past for college students |url=http://college.usatoday.com/2014/10/21/bullying-not-a-thing-of-the-past-for-college-students/ |website=usatoday.com |date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The misconception that bullying does not occur in higher education began to receive attention after the death of college student [[Suicide of Tyler Clementi|Tyler Clementi]]. According to an experiment conducted by Dr. Gary R. Walz,  "21.47% of participants reported rarely being victims of cyberbullying; 93.29% reported rarely cyberbullying others. Overall, there was a low prevalence rate for cyberbullying."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Walz |first=Garry |date=2016 |title=Cyberbullying on Social Media Among College Students |url=https://www.counseling.org/docs/default-source/vistas/article_03b0bf24f16116603abcacff0000bee5e7.pdf?sfvrsn=4 |journal=Vistas Online |volume= |pages=8 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Power imbalance ==
Bullying is usually associated with an imbalance of [[Power (social and political)|power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Meyer |first=Doug |date= |title=The Gentle Neoliberalism of Modern Anti-bullying Texts: Surveillance, Intervention, and Bystanders in Contemporary Bullying Discourse |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13178-016-0238-9 |journal=Sexuality Research &amp; Social Policy |volume=13 |issue=4 |page=356 |via= |doi=10.1007/s13178-016-0238-9 |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bully has a perceived authority over another due to factors such as size, gender, or age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sylvester, Ruth |title=Teacher as Bully: Knowingly or Unintentionally Harming Students |journal=Morality in Education |year=2011 |pages=42–45 |volume=77 |issue=2 |url=http://www.deltakappagamma.org/NH/dkgbulletinwinter2011.PDF#page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boys tend to bully peers based on the peer's physical weakness, short temper, friend group, and clothing. Bullying among girls, on the other hand, results from factors such as facial appearance, [[emotional]] factors, being [[overweight]], and academic status.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18447077 |url=http://njbullying.org/documents/beaty-adolesc-research3-08.pdf |year=2008 |last1=Beaty |first1=LA |last2=Alexeyev |first2=EB |title=The problem of school bullies: What the research tells us |volume=43 |issue=169 |pages=1–11 |journal=Adolescence}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sexes tend to target people with [[speech impediment]]s of some sort (such as stutter).

Bullies often come from families that use physical forms of discipline.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1026695430820 |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=83–106 |last1=Nelson |first1=E.

== Locations ==
Bullying locations vary by context. Most bullying in elementary school happens in the playground. In middle school and high school, it occurs most in the hallways, which have little supervision. According to the [[US Department of Education|U.S Department of Education]]'s [[National Center for Education Statistics]], more than 47% of kids reported getting bullied in hallways and stairway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.jrn.msu.edu/bullying/2012/02/16/bullying-locations/ |title=Hallways, stairwells are bullying hot spots |work=The New Bullying | access-date = 26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bus stops and bus rides to and from school tend to be hostile environments as well; children tend to view the driver as someone with no disciplinary authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keepyourchildsafe.org/bullying/where-bullying-occurs.html |title=The places where bullying occurs; where bullying takes place |website=Child Safety and Abuse Prevention Programs| access-date = 26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullying may also follows people into adult life and university. Bullying can take over the lives of both lecturers and students, and can lead to supervisors putting pressure on students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Norman, O'Higgins |first=Jmes |year=2016 |title=2. Bullying among University Students |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-4055733771/2-bullying-among-university-students |journal=International Journal of Emotional Education |volume=8 |pages= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying can happen in any place at any time.

== Warning signs ==
Victims of bullying typically are physically smaller, more sensitive, unhappy, cautious, anxious, quiet, and withdrawn. They are often described as [[passivity (behavior)|passive]] or submissive. Possessing these qualities make these individuals vulnerable, as they are seen as being less likely to retaliate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Signs that a child is being bullied include:&lt;ref name="United States 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Victimology"&gt;{{cite book |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |isbn=978-1-4129-6047-2 |last1=Fisher |first1=Bonnie |last2=Lab |first2=Steven |last3=Miller |first3=Holly Ventura |last4=Miller |first4=J.

== Roles ==
[[File:Wikibully.jpg|thumb|Cartoon representation of a bully and a victim used to depict [[Western Europe]]an powers and the United States "bullying" [[Serbia]] in the aftermath of the [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence]] during the [[2008 Serbian protests]]]]
McNamee and Mercurio state that there is a  "bullying triangle", consisting of the person doing the bullying, the person getting bullied, and the bystander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00094056.2008.10523045 |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=370–378 |last1=McNamee |first1=Abigail |last2=Mercurio |first2=Mia |title=School-Wide Intervention in the Childhood Bullying Triangle |journal=Childhood Education |date=1 August 2008}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[US Department of Health and Human Services]] divides the people involved in bullying into several roles:&lt;ref name="United States 2013"&gt;{{cite web |last=US Department of Health and Human Services |title=The Roles Kids Play |work=What is Bullying |accessdate=25 September 2013 |date=16 October 2012 |url=http://www.stopbullying.gov/what-is-bullying/roles-kids-play/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bully''': student with social and/or physical power who repeatedly picks on another student or group of students with the intent to inflict harm or discomfort
* '''Victim''': the target of the bullying
* '''Bystander''': student who observes bullying; they may ignore it, encourage it, or defend the victim
* '''Student who assists''': does not start the bullying, but helps and is encouraged by surrounding peers to do so. They may feel that their social status will be damaged if they are not involved.
* '''Student who reinforces''': play a minor role in bullying, such as laughing at the bully's insults
* '''Outsider''': not involved in the bullying but witnesses it
* '''Defendant''': defends the victim or consoles them afterwards

In her book, ''[[The Bully, the Bullied, and the Bystander]]'', Barbara Coloroso divides bullies into several types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Collins Living [HarperResource] |isbn=978-0-06-174460-0 |last=Coloroso |first=Barbara |title=The Bully, the Bullied, and the Bystander: From Preschool To High School – How Parents and Teachers Can Help Break the Cycle of Violence |location=New York |year=2004 |pages=11–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''confident bully''' has a very high opinion of themselves and feels a sense of superiority over other students.
*The '''social bully''' uses rumors, gossip, and verbal taunts to insult others. Social bullies are typically female and possess low self-esteem, and therefore try to bring others down.
*The '''fully armored bully''' shows very little emotion and often bullies when no one will see or stop them.
*The '''hyperactive bully''' typically has problems with academics and social skills. This student will often bully someone, then place the blame on someone else.
*A '''bullied bully''' is usually someone who has been bullied in the past or is bullied by an older sibling.
* A '''"bunch of bullies"''' (more often referred to as a "'''gang of bullies"''') is a group of friends who gang up on others for fun or due to their desire for power.

== Complex cultural dynamics ==
Parsons identifies school [[bullying culture]]s as typically having a web of [[Group dynamics|dynamics]] which are much more complex than just considering bullying amongst students. These dynamics include:&lt;ref name="Parsons"&gt;{{cite book |first=Les |last=Parsons |title=Bullied Teacher – Bullied Student: How to Recognize the Bullying Culture in Your School And What to Do About It |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k_wXp4pUJeQC |year=2005 |publisher=Pembroke Publishers Limited |isbn=978-1-55138-190-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Some students bully''' other students; some of these student bullies are themselves bullied by other student bullies; some of these student bullies bully teachers.
* '''Some teachers bully''' students; some teacher bullies bully other teachers; some teacher bullies bully parents.
* '''Some office staff bully''' teachers, students and parents.
* '''Some [[Head teacher|principals]] bully''' teachers, office staff, students and parents.
* '''Some parents bully''' teachers, office staff, principals, and even their own children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dake |first=J. A. |author2=Price, J. H. |author3=Telljohann, S.

== Common misconceptions ==
Researchers have identified many misconceptions regarding bullying:&lt;ref name="Olweus 2003 12"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Olweus |first=Dan |title=A Profile of Bullying at School |journal=Educational Leadership |date=March 2003 |volume=60 |issue=6 |page=12 |url=http://lhsela.weebly.com/uploads/7/9/0/8/7908073/_olweus_profile_of_bullying.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scarpaci |first=Richard |title=Bullying: Effective Strategies for Its Prevention |journal=Kappa Delta Pi Record |year=2006 |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=170–174 |doi=10.1080/00228958.2006.10518023 |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ738087.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Bullying is a consequence of [[Class size|large class or school size]].
* Bullying is a consequence of competition for grades and failure in school.
* Bullying is a consequence of poor self-esteem and insecurity.
* Bullying is just teasing.
* Some people deserve to be bullied.
* Only boys are bullies.
* Bullying is a normal part of growing up.
* Bullies will go away if ignored.
* The best way to deal with a bully is by fighting or trying to get even.
* People who are bullied will only hurt for a while before recovering.
* Bullying is thought of as a K-12 issue that ceases to exist once students enter college.&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt;

== Prevention ==
Studies have shown that bullying programs set up in schools with the help and engagements of staff and faculty have been shown to reduce peer victimization and bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Brennan |first1=L.

Measures such as increasing awareness,{{Contradict-inline|date=September 2016}} instituting [[Zero tolerance (schools)|zero tolerance]] for fighting, or placing troubled students in the same group or classroom are actually ineffective in reducing bullying; methods that ''are'' effective include increasing empathy for victims; adopting a program that includes teachers, students, and parents; and having students lead anti-bullying efforts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Invitation to the Life Span |last=Berger |first=Kathleen Stassen |publisher=Worth Publishers |year=2014 |isbn=1464172056 |location=New York |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pages needed|date=September 2016}} Success is most associated with beginning interventions at an early age, constantly evaluating programs for effectiveness, and having some students simply take online classes to avoid bullies at school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.detweedeverdieping.nu/images/pdf/Update%20on%20bullying%20at%20school.pdf |title=Update on bullying at school: Science forgotten? |last=Berger |first=Kathleen Stassen |date=2007 |journal=Developmental Review |doi=10.1016/j.dr.2006.08.002 |pmid= |volume=27 |pages=90–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United Kingdom ====
Section 89 of the [[Education and Inspections Act 2006]] provides for an anti-bullying policy for all state schools to be made available to parents.

==== United States ====
The victims of some school shootings have sued both the shooters' families and the schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brownstein |first=Andrew |title=The bully pulpit: post-Columbine harassment victims take schools to court |work=Trial |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+bully+pulpit:+post-Columbine+harassment+victims+take+schools+to...-a097175612 |date=December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point only 23 states had Anti-Bullying laws. In 2015 Montana became the last state to have an anti-bullying law and at that point all 50 states had an anti-bullying law.

In 2016, a legal precedent was set by a mother and her son, after the son was bullied at his public school. The mother and son won a court case against the [[Ottawa-Carleton District School Board]], making this the first case in North America where a [[school board]] has been found negligent in a bullying case for failing to meet the standard of care (the "[[duty of care]]" that the school board owes to its students).

The [[Ministry of Education (Taiwan)|Ministry of Education]] launched a serial of project. In 2006, they started the 'anti-bully plan'. In 2008, they launched the 'prevent bully video from public project', and also building  multiple informants route, monitoring the school, in hope that it could improve the education quality.&lt;ref&gt;The education analysis and anti policy. 陳利銘、鄭英耀、黃正鵠(2010)。反霸凌政策之分析與改進建議。教育政策論壇，13(3)，1–25。&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual identity''' is how one thinks of oneself in terms of to whom one is [[romance (love)|romantically]] or [[Sexual attraction|sexually]] attracted.&lt;ref name="Reiter"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reiter L |title=Sexual orientation, sexual identity, and the question of choice|journal=Clinical Social Work Journal|volume=17 |pages=138–50|year=1989}}[http://www.springerlink.com/content/g248324552457105/]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sexual identity'' may also refer to '''sexual orientation identity''', which is when people identify or dis-identify with a [[sexual orientation]] or choose not to identify with a sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=apa2009&gt;{{cite journal|title=Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|pages=63, 86|date=2009|accessdate=February 3, 2015|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/therapeutic-response.pdf|quote=Sexual orientation identity—not sexual orientation—appears to change via psychotherapy, support groups, and life events.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual identity and [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] are closely related to sexual orientation, but they are distinguished,&lt;ref name="Reiter"/&gt; with ''[[Identity (social science)|identity]]'' referring to an individual's conception of themselves, ''behavior'' referring to actual sexual acts performed by the individual, and ''sexual orientation'' referring to romantic or sexual attractions toward persons of the opposite [[sex]] or [[gender]], the same sex or gender,  to both sexes or more than one gender, or to no one.

Historical models of sexual identity have tended to view its formation as a process undergone only by [[Sexual minority|sexual minorities]], while more contemporary models view the process as far more universal and attempt to present sexual identity within the larger scope of other major identity theories and processes.&lt;ref name="Dillon, F. R. 2011 pp.649-670"&gt;Dillon, F. R., Worthington, R. L., &amp; Moradi, B. (2011). Sexual identity as a universal process In S. J. Schwartz, K. Luyckx, &amp; V. L. Vignoles (Eds), Handbook of identity theory and research (Vols 1 and 2), (pp.649-670). New York, NY: Springer Science + Business Media&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions and identity ==
Sexual identity has been described as a component of an individual's identity that reflects their sexual self-concept. The integration of the respective identity components (e.g. moral, religious, ethnic, occupational) into a greater overall identity is essential to the process of developing the multi-dimensional construct of identity.&lt;ref&gt;Luyckx, K., Schwartz, S. J., Goossens, L., Beyers, W., &amp; Missotten, L. (2011). Processes of personal identity formation and evaluation. In S. J. Schwartz, K. Luyckx, &amp; V. L. Vignoles(Eds), Handbook of identity theory and research (Vols 1 and 2) (pp.77-98). New York, NY: Springer Science + Business Media&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual identity can change throughout an individual's life, and may or may not align with biological sex, sexual behavior or actual sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, Karen, About Whoever: The Social Imprint on Identity and Orientation, NY, 2013 {{ISBN|9780981450513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosario et al."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosario | first1 = M. | last2 = Schrimshaw | first2 = E. | last3 = Hunter | first3 = J. | last4 = Braun | first4 = L. | year = 2006 | title = Sexual identity development among lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths: Consistency and change over time | url = | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 43 | issue = 1| pages = 46–58 | doi=10.1080/00224490609552298| pmc = 3215279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Concordance/discordance in SO"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Michael W.

In a 1990 study by the Social Organization of Sexuality, only 16% of women and 36% of men who reported some level of [[Homosexuality|same-sex attraction]] had a homosexual or bisexual identity.&lt;ref name=survey&gt;{{cite book|title=The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the United States|last=Laumann|first=Edward O.|year=1994|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=72AHO0rE2HoC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=the+social+organization+of+sexuality+1990&amp;source=web&amp;ots=kHfFtQQH7j&amp;sig=ZS5sk4GqzcR4e8mLVIHTNPsHt-Y#PPA299,M1|pages=298–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual identity is more closely related to sexual behavior than sexual orientation is. The same survey found that 96% of women and 87% of men with a homosexual or bisexual identity had engaged in sexual activity with someone of the same sex, contrasted to 32% of women and 43% of men who had same-sex attractions. Upon reviewing the results, the organization commented: "Development of self-identification as homosexual or gay is a psychological and socially complex state, something which, in this society, is achieved only over time, often with considerable personal struggle and self-doubt, not to mention social discomfort."&lt;ref name=survey /&gt;

===Unlabeled sexuality===
Unlabeled sexuality is when an individual chooses to not label their sexual identity. This identification could stem from one's uncertainty about their sexuality or their unwillingness to conform to a sexuality because they don't necessarily like labels, or they wish to feel free in their attractions instead of feeling forced into same, other, both, or pan attractions because of their sexual identity. Identifying as unlabeled could also be because of one's "unwillingness to accept their sexual minority status."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Diamond | first1 = Lisa M | year = 2007 | title = A dynamical systems approach to the development and expression of female same-sex sexuality | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 142–161 | doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00034.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because being unlabeled is the purposeful decision of no sexual identity, it is different from bisexuality or any other sexual identity. Those who are unlabeled are more likely to view sexuality as less stable and more fluid and tend to focus more on the “person, not the gender.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brooks | first1 = Kelly D. | last2 = Quina | first2 = Kathryn | year = 2009 | title = Women's sexual identity patterns: Differences among lesbians, bisexuals, and unlabeled women | url = | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 56 | issue = 8| pages = 1030–1045 | doi=10.1080/00918360903275443}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
It is reported that some women who identify as unlabeled did so because they are unable or uncertain about the types of relationships they will have in the future. As such, this divergence from sexual labels could provide for a person to be able to more fully realize their "true" sexuality because it frees them from the pressure of liking and being attracted to who their sexual identification dictates they should like.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==Development==
{{See also|Coming out|Homosexuality and psychology}}

===General===
Most of the research on sexual orientation identity development focuses on the development of people who are attracted to the same sex. Many people who feel attracted to members of their own sex [[coming out|come out]] at some point in their lives. ''Coming out'' is described in three phases. The first phase is the phase of "knowing oneself," and the realization emerges that one is sexually and emotionally attracted to members of one's own sex. This is often described as an internal coming out and can occur in childhood or at puberty, but sometimes as late as age 40 or older. The second phase involves a decision to come out to others, e.g. family, friends, and/or colleagues, while the third phase involves living openly as an [[LGBT]] person.&lt;ref name="hrccontinuum"&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=2007-05-04 |url=http://dev.hrc.org/issues/3333.htm |periodical=[[Human Rights Campaign]] |title=The Coming Out Continuum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102101657/http://dev.hrc.org/issues/3333.htm |archivedate=2007-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States today, people often come out during high school or college age. At this age, they may not trust or ask for help from others, especially when their orientation is not accepted in society. Sometimes they do not inform their own families.

According to Rosario, Schrimshaw, Hunter, Braun (2006), "the development of a lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) sexual identity is a complex and often difficult process. Unlike members of other minority groups (e.g., ethnic and racial minorities), most LGB individuals are not raised in a community of similar others from whom they learn about their identity and who reinforce and support that identity" and "[r]ather, LGB individuals are often raised in communities that are either ignorant of or openly hostile toward homosexuality."&lt;ref name="Rosario et al."/&gt;

Some individuals with [[ego-dystonic sexual orientation|unwanted sexual attractions]] may choose to actively dis-identify with a sexual minority identity, which creates a different sexual orientation identity from their actual sexual orientation.  Sexual orientation identity, but not sexual orientation, can change through [[psychotherapy]], [[support group]]s, and life events.&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt;  A person who has homosexual feelings can self-identify in various ways.  An individual may come to accept an LGB identity, to develop a [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] identity, to reject an LGB identity while choosing to identify as [[ex-gay]], or to refrain from specifying a sexual identity.&lt;ref name=apa&gt;[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/therapeutic-response.pdf Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation], pp. 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' article on reconciling faith and homosexuality, researcher Judith Glassgold, who chaired the task force, stated, "We're not trying to encourage people to become ''ex-gay''’" and "there has been little research on the long-term effects of rejecting a gay identity, but there is 'no clear evidence of harm' and 'some people seem to be content with that path'".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124950491516608883 A New Therapy on Faith and Sexual Identity: Psychological Association Revises Treatment Guidelines to Allow Counselors to Help Clients Reject Their Same-Sex Attractions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Models of sexual identity development===
Several models have been created to describe coming out as a process for gay and lesbian identity development (e.g. Dank, 1971; Cass, 1984; Coleman, 1989; Troiden, 1989). These historical models have taken a view of sexual identity formation as a sexual-minority process only.&lt;ref&gt;Savin-Williams, R. (2011) Identity development among sexual-minority youth. In S. J. Schwartz, K. Luyckx, &amp; V. L. Vignoles(Eds), Handbook of identity theory and research (Vols 1 and 2) (pp.671-689). New York, NY: Springer Science + Business Media&lt;/ref&gt; However, not every LGBT person follows such a model. For example, some LGBT youth become aware of and accept their same-sex desires or gender identity at puberty in a way similar to which heterosexual teens become aware of their sexuality, i.e. free of any notion of difference, stigma or shame in terms of the gender of the people to whom they are attracted.&lt;ref&gt;Savin-Williams, R. (2005). The new gay teenager. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; More contemporary models take the stance that it is a more universal process.&lt;ref name="Dillon, F. R. 2011 pp.649-670"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morgan | first1 = E. M. | year = 2012 | title = Not always a straight path: College students' narratives of heterosexual identity development | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 66 | issue = 1–2| pages = 79–93 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-011-0068-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Current models for the development of sexual identity attempt to incorporate other models of identity development, such as Marcia’s ego-identity statuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Worthington | first1 = R. L. | last2 = Navarro | first2 = R. L. | last3 = Savoy | first3 = H. B. | last4 = Hampton | first4 = D. | year = 2008 | title = Development, reliability, and validity of the measure of sexual identity exploration and commitment (MOSIEC) | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 22–33 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.44.1.22 | pmid=18194002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cass identity model]], established by Vivienne Cass, outlines six discrete stages transited by individuals who successfully come out: (1) identity confusion, (2) identity comparison, (3) identity tolerance, (4) identity acceptance, (5) identity pride, and (6) identity synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cass | first1 = V. C. | year = 1979 | title = Homosexuality identity formation: A theoretical model | url = | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 219–235 | doi=10.1300/j082v04n03_01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fassinger's model of gay and lesbian identity development]] contains four stages at the individual and group level: (1) awareness, (2) exploration, (3) deepening/commitment, and (4) internalization/synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fassinger | first1 = R. E. | last2 = Miller | first2 = B. A. | year = 1997 | title = Validation of an Inclusive Modelof Sexual Minority Identity Formation on a Sample of Gay Men | url = | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 53–78 | doi=10.1300/j082v32n02_04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some models of sexual identity development do not use discrete, ordered stages, but instead conceptualize identity development as consisting of independent identity processes. For example, D'Augelli's model describes six unordered independent identity processes: (1) exiting heterosexual identity, (2) Developing personal LGB identity status, (3) Developing a LGB social identity, (4) Becoming a LGB offspring, (5) Developing a LGB intimacy status, and (6) Entering a LGB community.&lt;ref&gt;D'Augelli, A. R. (1994). Identity development and sexual orientation: Toward a model of lesbian, gay, and bisexual development.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Unifying Model of Sexual Identity Development is currently the only model that incorporates heterosexual identity development within its statuses to include compulsory heterosexuality, active exploration, diffusion, deepening and commitment to status, and synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Dillion, F. R., Worthington, R. L., &amp; Moradi, B. (2011). Sexual identity as a universal process. In S. J. Schwartz, K. Luyckx, &amp; V. L. Vignoles (Eds.), Handbook of identity theory and research (pp. 649-670). New York: Springer. &lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary models view sexual identity formation as a universal process, rather than a sexual minority one, in that it is not only sexual minorities that undergo sexual identity development, but heterosexual populations as well.&lt;ref name="Dillon, F. R. 2011 pp.649-670" /&gt; More recent research has supported these theories, having demonstrated that heterosexual populations display all of Marcia’s statuses within the domain of sexual identity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Worthington | first1 = R. L. | last2 = Savoy | first2 = H. B. | last3 = Dillon | first3 = F. R. | last4 = Vernaglia | first4 = E. R. | year = 2002 | title = Heterosexual identity development.

'''Shram Suvidha''' is a Web Portal to provide a single platform for all labour compliances.

[[India]] has more than 40 labour laws regulated by the[[Ministry of Labour and Employment (India)| Ministry of Labour and Employment]], the [[Government of India]] and State Government. Compliance with these laws is tedious and time-consuming. As a result, employers often do not comply. The scale of noncompliance exceeds the ability of enforcement agencies to regulate. Amidst the confusion, employees do not always receive what they are entitled to under these laws. 

==Objectives==
The primary objectives of Shram Suvidha are:

* A unified portal for all compliance pertaining to Chief Labour Commissioner of India, Director General Mines and Safety, Employee State Insurance Corporation, and Employee Provident Fund Organization. There are 16 laws that are covered here like Payment of Wages Act, [[Minimum Wages Act 1948|Minimum Wages Act]], Contract Labour (Abolition and Regulation) Act.
* Creation of a unique number known as the Labour Identification Number or LIN to supplement all other registration numbers such as PF Establishment Code, [[ESIC]] Registration Number, Contract Labour Registration Number, etc.
* Online servicing of notices from the labour department and online submission of answers with document.
* Employee grievances can now be received online and employer has to clear them and submit proof of clearance.

==Process==
Shram Suvidha allows an organization to know what labour laws apply to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shramsamadhan.com/p/shram-suvidha-compliances-explanations.html|title=Shram Suvidha Compliances &amp; Explanations|website=Shramsamadhan.com|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://shramsuvidha.gov.in/home.action|title=Shram Suvidha : (One-Stop-Shop for Labour Law Compliance)|website=Shramsuvidha.gov.in|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compliances are reportable in a single form that makes it simple for those filing such forms. Performance is monitored using key indicators thus making the evaluation process objective. It promotes the use of a common Labour Identification Number (LIN) by all Implementing agencies.

[[File:Shugibukuro-example-japan-feb9-2018.jpg|thumb|An example of a shūgi-bukuro.]]

A {{Nihongo|'''''shūgi-bukuro'''''|祝儀袋}} is a special envelope in which [[money]] is given as a gift at [[Marriage in Japan|weddings in Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordenker, Alice, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ek20110621wh.html Kinpū]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 21 June 2011, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very common in Japan to give a gift of money at weddings. The giver inserts the money into a ''shūgi-bukuro'' on which they have written their name. The ''shūgi-bukuro'' is handed to the receptionist of the [[Wedding reception|reception party]]. ''Shūgi-bukuro'' are sold at supermarkets and stationery stores.

==Amount given==
The amount given in ''shūgi-bukuro'' differs according to the givers relationship to the couple, their social status and the style of venue. In the case of friends or company colleagues, it is usually between [[Yen|¥30,000]] and ¥50,000. In the case of close friends or those in a senior position at the bride or bridegroom’s company, ¥30,000 to ¥50,000 is common, and in the case of relatives, ¥50,000 to ¥100,000 is not unusual.

For married couples that attend the wedding ¥50,000 would be common, as opposed to unmarried couples where each person would give a separate amount say ¥30,000 each.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}}

It is common to give amounts in which the leading digit(s) form an [[Parity (mathematics)|odd]] number, such as ¥30,000 or ¥50,000, in order to symbolize the fact that the newly married couple cannot be divided. When the leading digit forms an even number, as in ¥20,000, the amount is usually given in an odd number of bills (e.g. 1 x ¥10,000 and 2 x ¥5,000).  Amounts in which the leading digit forms a multiple of 4, such as ¥40,000, are not recommended since the number 4 in Japanese can be [[Pronunciation|pronounced]] as ''[[Shi (kana)|shi]]'' which is the same as the pronunciation of the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for [[Japanese_superstitions#Numbers|death]]. Likewise, multiples of 9 are avoided because the pronunciation of this number can mean suffering.

 &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\,t_r=t_s-t_e&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; is equivalently computed as
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\, t_r = t_n - t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;, apparently &lt;math&gt; t_r \in [0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the behavior of a given atomic DEVS model can be defined in two different views depending on the total state and the external transition function (refer to [[Behavior of DEVS]]), the simulation algorithms are also introduced in two different views as below.

== Common parts ==
Regardless of two different views of total states, algorithms for initialization and internal transition cases are commonly defined as below.

 DEVS-simulator
   variables:
     parent // parent coordinator
     &lt;math&gt;t_l&lt;/math&gt;     // time of last event
     &lt;math&gt;t_n&lt;/math&gt;     // time of next event
     &lt;math&gt;A=(X,Y,S,ta, \delta_{ext}, \delta_{int}, \lambda) &lt;/math&gt;// the associated [[DEVS#Atomic DEVS|Atomic DEVS]] model 
   when receive init-message(Time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;)
      &lt;math&gt; t_l \leftarrow t;&lt;/math&gt;
      &lt;math&gt; t_n \leftarrow t_l + ta(s); &lt;/math&gt;
   when receive star-message(Time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;)
      if &lt;math&gt; t \ne t_n &lt;/math&gt; then
         error: bad synchronization;
      &lt;math&gt; y \leftarrow \lambda(s);&lt;/math&gt;
      send y-message(&lt;math&gt;y,t&lt;/math&gt;) to parent;
      &lt;math&gt; s \leftarrow \delta_{int}(s)&lt;/math&gt;
      &lt;math&gt; t_l \leftarrow t;&lt;/math&gt;
      &lt;math&gt; t_n \leftarrow t_l + ta(s); &lt;/math&gt;

== View 1: total states = states * elapsed times ==
As addressed in [[Behavior of Atomic DEVS]], when DEVS receives an input event, right calling &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ext}&lt;/math&gt;, the last event time,&lt;math&gt;t_l&lt;/math&gt; is set by the current time,&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, thus the elapsed time&lt;math&gt;t_e&lt;/math&gt; becomes zero because &lt;math&gt;t_e = t - t_l&lt;/math&gt;.

   when receive x-message(&lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, Time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;)
      if &lt;math&gt;( t_l \le t &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; t \le t_n )&lt;/math&gt; == false then
         error: bad synchronization;
      &lt;math&gt; s \leftarrow \delta_{ext}(s,t-t_l, x)&lt;/math&gt;
      &lt;math&gt; t_l \leftarrow t;&lt;/math&gt;
      &lt;math&gt; t_n \leftarrow t_l + ta(s); &lt;/math&gt;

==View 2: total states = states * lifespans * elapsed times==
Notice that as addressed in [[Behavior of Atomic DEVS]], depending on the value of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; return by &lt;math&gt; \delta_{ext}&lt;/math&gt;, last event time,&lt;math&gt;t_l&lt;/math&gt;, and next event time,&lt;math&gt;t_n&lt;/math&gt;,consequently, elapsed time, &lt;math&gt;t_e&lt;/math&gt;, and lifespan&lt;math&gt;t_n&lt;/math&gt;, are updated (if &lt;math&gt;b=1&lt;/math&gt;) or preserved (if &lt;math&gt;b=0&lt;/math&gt;).

   when receive x-message(&lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, Time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;)
      if &lt;math&gt;( t_l \le t &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; t \le t_n )&lt;/math&gt; == false then
         error: bad synchronization;
      &lt;math&gt; (s,b) \leftarrow \delta_{ext}(s, t-t_l, x)&lt;/math&gt;
      if &lt;math&gt; b = 1 &lt;/math&gt; then 
         &lt;math&gt; t_l \leftarrow t;&lt;/math&gt;
         &lt;math&gt; t_n \leftarrow t_l + ta(s); &lt;/math&gt;

The '''spoon class theory''' refers to the idea that individuals in a country can be classified into different socioeconomic classes based on the [[assets]] and income level of their parents, and as a consequence, one's success in life depends entirely on being born into a wealthy family. The term appeared in 2015 and was first widely used among online communities in [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201511172020555&amp;code=990101#csidx12244c8ff021ec9929ac09c2834ec8e금수저·흙수저는 현실, 한국은 신계급사회로 가고 있다], Kyunghang Shinmun&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The theory is thought to originate from the well-known English [[idiom]] "born with a [[silver spoon]] in one's mouth". In the past, European [[nobility]] often used silver dishes, and children were fed by nannies using silver spoons, which indicated the wealth of the family. In South Korea, this idea was taken further to establish several categories to classify individuals based on their family's wealth.

== Spoon classes ==
The spoon classes have been identified as follows:
*The gold spoon – within top one per cent of population, with more than $200K annual salary and more than $2 million in assets.
*The silver spoon – within top three per cent of population, with $100K ~ $200K annual salary and $1 ~ $2 million in assets.
*The bronze spoon – within top ten per cent of population, with $50K ~ $100K annual salary and $500K ~ $1 million in assets.
*The plastic spoon – those with less than $20K annual salary and less than $100K in assets.
*The dirt spoon – those with less than $10K annual salary and less than $50K in assets.

== Sociological analysis ==
Hyo Chan Cho, the author of hyper-reality shock, explained that the meaning of gold spoon, which is common in Korea's society, "is related to [[Jean Baudrillard]]'s [[simulacrum]]". He suggested that the gold spoon is included in a simulacrum that doesn't have an origin. Issues of gold spoon celebrities and commercials which made those people idealize changed nonexistence as existence. Regardless of the pros and cons of a gold spoon, it became an important image of their life. He further stated that as our society accepted images like gold spoon which became a [[hyperreality]]. We accept media's reproducing images that don't have originals as more than an existence. ‘Simulacrum' means an image without substance, it wields strong influence than an existence.&lt;ref&gt;[Son of mother's friend' and ‘Gold Spoon': to deconstruct the class discourse and rewriting stories of parents-children on modern society], ‘엄친아'에서_‘금수저'까지_현대사회의_계급담론을_해체하고_부모자녀의_이야기_다시_쓰기 Kim, Min Hwa, Shinhan University, 2016, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Young adults preparing for significant life changes such as college, marriage or employment are concerned that they are at a disadvantage. For example, many corporations in Korea require stellar academic performance and for applicants to speak English fluently. Individuals who come from the upper class can advance themselves due to the wealth and power that their parents or family possess. Young people who come from the middle and lower class are at a disadvantage because often they are expected to work and attend school, coupled with the fact that they are not being provided with the same monetary support as their wealthier peers. This economic polarization not only influences employment but also affects other things like marriage. The causes of inequality in this society are economic and the fact that poverty is passed from generation to generation. This inequality is creating new classes in Korean society. However, some people overcome their parent's low economic class. Some people who were raised in wealthy families criticize this as well. Unfairness in Korean society is becoming a burden for young adults and is making the Korean society similar to the one described in the spoon class theory.&lt;ref&gt;[소태영(Tate Young So), "‘수저계급론' 논쟁의 중심에 선 한국 청년들의 열등감(inferiority) 극복을 위한 영성교육", 기독교교육정보/50(-), 2016, 119-153, 한국기독교교육정보학회]&lt;/ref&gt;

Park Jae-wan, a professor at [[Sungkyunkwan University]] analyzed spoon class theory in research on social mobility. "The distribution of income in Korea is close to that of advanced countries, considering Gini coefficient, relative income share, income share, and relative poverty rate." "The basis of 'Helos' or 'gold spoon' claims is weak".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.keri.org/web/www/research_0204?p_p_id=EXT_BBS&amp;p_p_lifecycle=0&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;_EXT_BBS_struts_action=/ext/bbs/view_message&amp;_EXT_BBS_messageId=354026|title=사회이동성에 대한 진단과 대안모색 - 흙수저는 금수저가 될 수 없는가 - - 한국경제연구원|last=Fu:z|website=www.keri.org|language=ko|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the results of estimating the probability that each income group will remain in the same class for the whole household from 2011 to 12, it is 29.8 per cent for low income class, 38.2 per cent for middle class and 32.0 per cent for high income class. Park Jae-wan suggested, "As the results of the analysis, Korea is still highly likely to move." However, the pace of stratification has been slowing since the financial crisis, mainly because the poverty has been fixed, particularly among the elderly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; " He cited the following five causes of Spoon class theory. 1. Youth unemployment 2. Reinforced pass down 3. Government regulation and vested interest 4. Relative tendency and relative deprivation of Koreans 5. Bad social capital.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Han Jun, professor of sociology at [[Yonsei University|Yeonsei University]] said, "Raising the possibility of social mobility is also an important task in terms of social vitality and social integration." It requires policy efforts to care for the physical and mental health of low-income vulnerable children, academic aspirations, and cognitive abilities, Emphasis should be given to schools in low-income vulnerable groups and rural and rural areas. "&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Lee Byeong-hoon, professor of sociology at [[Chung-Ang University]], said, "Negative and critical perceptions of opportunistic inequality in our society seem to be influenced by factors such as hierarchy status and experience of discrimination." According to the analysis, the subject and parental generations have low subjective status, experience of discrimination and disadvantages, and younger and higher educated people have higher negative and critical perception of opportunity inequality. In addition, the perception of socioeconomic opportunity inequality, the severity of inequality in opportunity, and the negative perception of effort achievement were found to be higher in the order of lower income class, middle class, and higher income class.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Statistics ==

In the 1980s, the share of assets contributed by gifts and inheritance was 27 per cent, age groups spanning 19 to 75 years old: 181 men born between 1940 and 1959, the generation of industrialization; 593 men born between 1960 and 1974, the generation of democracy; and 568 men born between 1975 and 1995, the information generation''.''{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The results of the poll found that the spoon class theory not only existed in Korea but deepened with each successive generation. The study showed that the persistence of poverty across generations has deepened, with 50.7 per cent in the youngest generation answering that both father and son were in the lower class – an increase of almost 15 per cent from the 36.4 per cent who answered the same in the democracy generation. {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In the oldest generation, only 35.9 per cent answered that both father and son were considered in the lower class''.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=3014971 Socioeconomic disparities intensifying: report], The Korea Joongang Daily.&lt;/ref&gt;

CEO Score Daily '(2017) analyzed the assets fluctuation of 2007 ~ 2017 among the 160 wealthy stockholders of Korea, the United States, Japan and China (for each of the top 40) announced by Forbes. As a result, There are 48 (30 per cent) rich men in the four countries, and the wealthy self-And 112 patients (70 per cent). In Korea, 25 out of 40 equity holders (62.5 per cent) were 'Gold Spoon' It is much higher than that of the US (25 per cent), Japan (12 per cent) and China (2.5 per cent)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ceoscoredaily.com/news/article.html?no=37395|title=한국 상속형 부자 10명 중 6명...한미중일 4개국 중 최다|website=www.ceoscoredaily.com|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"As a result of analyzing the percentage of social movements by generation," said Han Jun, a professor of sociology at [[Yonsei University]], "social movements decreased slightly from 85 percent to 81 percent compared to 20 years ago." According to the analysis, the younger generation (born in 1987–1994) compared to the young people in the 1990s (1966–75) had a 12 per cent decrease in the percentage of upward movements that gained a better job than their parents, The mobility rate has increased by about 8 percentage points, and social mobility has changed negatively. Professor Han Jun pointed out, "The problem is that the decrease in the mobility opportunity that I feel subjective is bigger than the actual one." According to the National Statistical Office (NSO), the negative perception of upside potential is 22 per cent more than 10 years ago (from 29 to 51 per cent) as of 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Korea's income mobility was the eighth highest among the 17 OECD member countries. Korea's income mobility is not relatively low, said Lee Jin-young, an assistant researcher at the Korea Economic Research Institute. According to the analysis of the inter-generation income elasticity of OECD member countries, Korea's income elasticity is 0.29, similar to New Zealand (0.29) and Sweden (0.27). On the other hand, Japan was higher than Korea with 0.34, 0.47 in the US and 0.32 in Germany.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
In 2015, Korean society entered into a new class era as inequality increased. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} According to Global Attitudes Survey conducted by [[Pew Research Center]], Korean citizens answered that the most threatening thing for them is inequality. However, the conclusion that inequality has a similar effect for all cultures should not be automatically assumed, since at least "8 other countries were content with inequality", including Greece. In contrast, Japan answered that nuclear weapons and radioactivity are most threatening. The results of this survey shows that the awareness of inequality is much higher than nuclear accidents and environmental pollution. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3228">In [[mathematics]], a '''ternary equivalence relation''' is a kind of [[ternary relation]] analogous to a [[binary relation|binary]] [[equivalence relation]]. A ternary equivalence relation is symmetric, reflexive, and transitive. The classic example is the relation of [[collinearity]] among three points in [[Euclidean space]]. In an abstract set, a ternary equivalence relation determines a collection of equivalence classes or ''[[pencil (mathematics)|pencils]]'' that form a [[linear space (geometry)|linear space]] in the sense of [[incidence geometry]]. In the same way,  a binary equivalence relation on a set determines a [[partition of a set|partition]].

==Definition==
A ternary equivalence relation on a set {{mvar|X}} is a relation {{math|''E'' ⊂ ''X''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, written {{math|[''a'', ''b'', ''c'']}}, that satisfies the following axioms:
#Symmetry: If {{math|[''a'', ''b'', ''c'']}} then {{math|[''b'', ''c'', ''a'']}} and {{math|[''c'', ''b'', ''a'']}}. (Therefore also {{math|[''a'', ''c'', ''b'']}}, {{math|[''b'', ''a'', ''c'']}}, and {{math|[''c'', ''a'', ''b'']}}.)
#Reflexivity: {{math|[''a'', ''b'', ''b'']}}. Equivalently, if {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} are not all distinct, then {{math|[''a'', ''b'', ''c'']}}.
#Transitivity:  If {{math|''a'' ≠ ''b''}} and {{math|[''a'', ''b'', ''c'']}} and {{math|[''a'', ''b'', ''d'']}} then {{math|[''b'', ''c'', ''d'']}}. (Therefore also {{math|[''a'', ''c'', ''d'']}}.)

The '''Torcuato di Tella Institute''' is a [[non-profit]] foundation organized for the promotion of [[Argentine culture]].

==Overview==
The di Tella Foundation and its institute were created on July 22, 1958, the tenth anniversary of the death of industrialist and arts patron [[Torcuato di Tella]]. Funding for the project, organized by his sons, Torcuato and [[Guido di Tella]], was raised using the United States model of corporate financing, as well as by the donation of 10% of the [[Siam di Tella]] corporation's [[public stock]]. Its objective was initially limited to an arts program revolving primarily around the display of the di Tella family's private collections, which prominently included works by [[Henry Moore]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and [[Jackson Pollock]].&lt;ref name=ditella&gt;[http://html.rincondelvago.com/instituto-di-tella.html Instituto Di Tella: Promoción del arte. Experimentación audiovisual. Investigación y financiación artística {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The board of the foundation consisted of family members, though the institute was directed by a board that included academics and intellectuals from outside the family. Guido di Tella would serve as president, and the post of director of the institute was offered to Enrique Oteiza, whose family were leading [[Pampas]]-area landowners. The foundation also received funding in the form of grants from the [[Ford Foundation|Ford]] and [[Rockefeller Foundation]]s, after which the modest initiative expanded into [[Argentine culture#Cinema and theatre|theater]] and [[Argentine music|music]], and grew to become the most significant cultural institution in Buenos Aires of the 1960s.&lt;ref name=ditella/&gt;

The institute continued to influence prevailing trends in the history of Argentine culture, however, and it adopted and advanced a [[modernist]] trend in various artistic disciplines. Its audiovisual center, established in 1960, and directed by Roberto Villanueva, premiered with a play, ''El Desatino'' (''The Folly''). The production's scenery backdrops were projected through slides, and introduced audiences to [[Nacha Guevara]] and [[Les Luthiers]]. This format would be promoted in subsequent years for its ability to broadcast material through compact and portable media in a way that would stimulate a network of local groups active in the cultural field.&lt;ref name=ditella/&gt;

Following its establishment, the di Tella art collection was transferred to the foundation, and [[Jorge Romero Brest]] hosted a free show at the [[Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (Buenos Aires)|National Museum of Fine Arts]], which the leading local art critic directed. The activities were transferred to a small office in the Museum of Fine Arts in August 1960, and this was followed by an annual award for national and international artists, many of which sold their works to the di Tella collection. As part of the awards program, the winners were awarded scholarships covering study abroad and an exhibition of works in a North American or European gallery. Growing local interest in [[Latin American art]] was accompanied by an initiative to show the di Tella collection across the Argentine hinterland, for which a minibus was purchased in 1963; the experiment, however, ended the following year, when the vehicle crashed in a rural [[La Rioja Province (Argentina)|La Rioja]] road.&lt;ref name=ditella/&gt;

An initiative by Guido di Tella led to the institute's relocation into a modern, newly completed [[Florida Street]] building in August 1963. The offices were rented by SIAM di Tella at the northern end of Florida Street, near [[Plaza San Martín (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Martín]], a busy pedestrian intersection in the upscale [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Retiro]] district that could attract larger audiences. The building was refurbished with the addition of three stage theatres, and interiors designed to be inviting, with a floor-to-ceiling glass panel façade featuring publicity photos taken by Humberto Rivas, and a large lobby. The modern, air-conditioned building was propitious for exhibits and artistic events year-round. Its café, like the gallery, was staffed by attendants who wore no uniforms, and allowed patrons to smoke and take photographs at their leisure.&lt;ref name=ditella/&gt;

Founded by [[classical music|classical]] composer [[Alberto Ginastera]], CLAEM (the Latin American Center for Advanced Musical Studies) was made part of the institute in 1962, yielding numerous productions of [[dodecaphonic]], [[electronic music|electronic]], and [[acoustic music]]; CLAEM attracted prominent international guest lecturers such as [[Aaron Copland]], [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]], and [[Iannis Xenakis]]. A visual arts center (CAV) was also inaugurated at the new address. Directed by Romero Brest, CAV became the leading Buenos Aires center for the display and promotion for [[avant-garde]] creations. CAV introduced art patrons to sculptors [[Juan Carlos Distéfano]], [[Julio Le Parc]], and [[Clorindo Testa]], as well as painters [[Romulo Macció]], [[Luis Felipe Noé]], [[Jorge de la Vega]], [[Ernesto Deira]], [[Antonio Seguí]], and [[conceptual art]]ists such as [[Edgardo Giménez]] and [[Marta Minujín]]. The latter garnered interest after earning the institute's first National Award in 1964, and became known for her "[[happening]]s." Erotic in some aspects, and provocative to conservative local audiences, her early di Tella Institute events included ''Eróticos en technicolor'' and the interactive ''Revuélquese y viva'' (''Roll Around in Bed and Live''). She then joined Rubén Santantonín in 1965 to create ''La Menesunda'' (''Mayhem''), where participants were asked to go through sixteen chambers, each separated by a human-shaped entry. Led by [[neon]] lights, groups of eight visitors would encounter rooms with television sets at full blast, couples making love in bed, a cosmetics counter (complete with an attendant), a dental office from which dialing an oversized rotary phone was required to leave, a walk-in freezer with dangling fabrics (suggesting sides of beef), and a mirrored room with [[black light]]ing, falling confetti, and the scent of frying food. The use of advertising throughout suggested the influence of [[pop art]] in Minujín's "mayhem." &lt;ref name=clarin2&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2005/07/06/conexiones/t-1008529.htm ''Clarín'' (7/6/2005) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Already established as the leading local center for [[pop art]], the di Tella Institute also became a forum for art as political commentary. This was dramatized by what became the center's most contentious display, sculptor [[León Ferrari]]'s  ''La civilización occidental y cristiana'' (''Western-Christian Civilization''), in October 1965. The work displays [[Christ]] [[crucifixion|crucified]] not by the traditional [[Christian cross|cross]]; but by a [[fighter aircraft|fighter plane]], as a symbolic protest against the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.argentinaxplora.com/activida/arte/ditella/ditell.htm Argentina Xplora: El Instituto di Tella {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

A turn of historical events in 1966 proved detrimental to the institute, and to [[freedom of expression]], when the civilian administration of President [[Arturo Illia]] was deposed on June 28 by the [[Argentine Armed Forces]], and was replaced with the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General [[Juan Carlos Onganía]]. Moderate in comparison with many of his counterparts in other Latin American nations, Onganía was, however, a member of the right-wing [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] power group, [[Opus Dei]], and as such, found many of the developments in Argentine culture during the 1960s offensive.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchison, Robert. ''Their Kingdom Come: Inside the Secret World of Opus Dei''. St. Martin's Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing his distaste for modern culture was Luis Margaride, whom he named head of the [[Policía Federal Argentina|Federal District Police]], and who would be remembered for his crusades against nightclubs, long hair, and miniskirts.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Martin. ''Dossier Secreto''. Westview Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Facing a government policy backdrop such as this, numerous avant-garde artists (and others, [[Noche de los Bastones Largos|particularly in academia]]) left Argentina, many never to return.&lt;ref name=crawley&gt;Crawley, Eduardo. ''A House Divided: Argentina 1880-1980''. St. Martin's Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

A self-styled ''mazanana loca'' (''city block of madness''), the center's agenda remained active initially, and this new era was marked by the advent of the "Experience"{{spaced ndash}}a fusion of the more controversial happenings with [[experimental theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/1998/suple/radar/mayo/98-05-24/nota2_a.htm ''Página/12'' (5/24/1998) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The decline in audiences and contributions, as well as the Siam di Tella Corporation's own, mounting financial problems, led to the curtailment of most of its activities by 1969, however. The Ford Foundation continued to support the institute, though these grants were contractually limited to social studies. The director, Enrique Oteiza, and two leading board members, [[Jorge Sábato]] and [[Roberto Cortés Conde]], resigned, and in May 1970, the famed Florida Street center hosted its last exhibition, a theatrical production by [[Marilú Marini]]. The foundation was bankrupt, and only the sale in 1971 of numerous works from its collection of [[Gothic art|Gothic]], [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]], and [[Baroque art]] to the federal government for 2.1 million [[Peso ley|pesos]] (US$500,000), staved off its liquidation.&lt;ref name=ditella/&gt;

Remembered nostalgically by friends of the arts, and particularly during the "[[Dirty War]]" of the late 1970s, when repression of political terrorism quickly extended to dissidents and controversial artists, the institute's absence became an example of the "cultural blackout" described by writer [[Ernesto Sábato]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Jordán, Alberto. ''El Proceso''. Emecé Editores, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Following President [[Néstor Kirchner]]'s appointment of Torcuato Di Tella (jr.) as Secretary of Culture in 2003, the idea of reviving the storied center was first plausibly discussed by the president of the board of regents of [[Torcuato di Tella University]], [[Manuel Mora y Araujo]].&lt;ref name=clarin&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2007/02/24/sociedad/s-05601.htm ''Clarín'' (2/24/2007) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the 1960s-era documentation and numerous works had been stored by the library at the university, the di Tella family's surviving contribution to local culture, and the material's recataloguing was initiated in 2004. New facilities were developed that year from a former water company building by one of the center's alumni, sculptor and architect [[Clorindo Testa]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=630140 ''La Nación'' (8/25/2004) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; and on April 21, 2007, the institute's center for visual arts was reinaugurated at the [[Figueroa Alcorta Avenue]] location with the ''Otro Modo'' (''Another Way'') Festival.&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt;  Continuing to host [[media art|media]] and [[conceptual art]] displays, the institute celebrated its 50th anniversary in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2008/03/07/um/m-01623241.htm ''Clarín'' (3/7/2008) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;
