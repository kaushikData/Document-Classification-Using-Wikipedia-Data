'''Baron La Croix''' (French for "Baron The Cross"), or ''Bawon Lakwa'' in [[Haitian Creole]], is one of the [[Guédé]], a [[Loa]] of the dead and sexuality, along with [[Baron Samedi]] and [[Baron Cimetière]] in [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]]. He is syncretized with [[Saint Expeditus]]. 

==Worship== 
Baron La Croix is often seen wearing a black tailcoat and carrying an elaborate cane. He is the ultimate suave and sophisticated spirit of Death - quite cultured and debonair. He has an existential philosophy about death, finding death's reason for being both humorous and absurd. Baron La Croix is the extreme expression of individuality, and offers to you the reminder of delighting in life's pleasures.&lt;ref&gt;http://voodoo.101projects101days.com/loa/baron-la-croix/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Betty Jane Willis''' (March 10, 1941 – January 1, 2018) was an American [[Soul music|soul]] singer in the 1960s.

==Biography==
Born on a farm in [[Mississippi]], Willis moved with her family to [[Fresno, California]], when she was two. In the early 1960s, she moved to [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]] and sang in [[Los Angeles]]-area nightclubs. Singer [[Bill Medley]], whose career with [[The Righteous Brothers]] was just beginning, was told about Willis. Medley and Willis recorded a song together at [[Gold Star Studios]], but it was never released. However, her voice and association with the studio drew notice from producers [[Phil Spector]] and [[Leon Russell]], who retooled the country song "[[Act Naturally]]" into a [[rhythm and blues]] version for Willis in 1965. As part of the duo Betty and Ray, with Ray Lockhart, she also made several other recordings. Her last known recording was in 1968.&lt;ref name="OC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ocregister.com/2018/01/04/betty-jane-willis-more-than-another-homeless-death-she-was-a-soul-singer/amp/ |title=Who was Betty Jane Willis? More than another homeless death, she was a soul singer |last=Walker |first=Theresa |date=January 4, 2018 |work=[[Orange County Register]] |access-date=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to her daughter, Willis enjoyed a singing career but did not want to be part of the [[music industry]]. She also grew frustrated when paperwork was mishandled that scuttled an Africa music tour. She briefly worked in a factory before becoming a postal worker in the 1980s and retired after 37 years.&lt;ref name="OC" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Despite having family in Santa Ana, Willis chose to mostly [[Homelessness in the United States|live on the street]] in retirement. She slept outside a fabric shop, arriving after the shop closed and leaving before it opened.&lt;ref name="OC" /&gt;

==Death==
Early on January 1, 2018, Willis was assaulted by a [[homeless]] man who attempted to rape her. She was hit repeatedly on the head and [[strangled]] to death, before police arrived to apprehend her attacker. Willis was 76.&lt;ref name="OC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/homeless-man-charged-with-killing-60s-soul-singer-betty-jane-willis/ |title=Homeless man charged with killing former '60s soul singer Betty Jane Willis |date=January 4, 2018 |publisher=[[CBS News]] |access-date=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bo Bo Aung''' ({{lang-my|ဘိုးဘိုးအောင်}}) was a prominent [[phothudaw]] and [[weizza]] ({{lang-my|ဝိဇ္ဇာ}}, {{lang-pi| vijjādhara}}), or wizard, from [[Sagaing]] who lived in [[Myanmar]] during the [[Konbaung Dynasty]], or the 18th century.  He was also called Maung Aung, or "Master Victory".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tuninst.net/FLK-ELE/ch05-magus/ch05-magus.htm|title=Folk Elements|accessdate=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He supposedly lived to be around 200 years of age.  He is credited with creating the modern wiezza movement when he discovered  manuscripts revealing the secrets of  weizzas and mastered the art of qin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://viss.wordpress.com/2008/08/11/the-world-of-weizzas/|title=The world of weizzas|accessdate=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://weizzarlan.blogspot.com/2009/07/bo-bo-aung-weizzar-with-white-robe.html|title= Bo Bo Aung |accessdate=2017-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Bo Bo" is a common [[Myanmar|Burmese]] [[honorific]] which translates to "uncle".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.michaelbackmanltd.com/998.html|title=Michael Backman Ltd ., Bo Bo Aung|accessdate=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

===Childhood===

Aung's exact birthdate is unknown, though he was a classmate of the future King [[Bodawpaya]], who was born in the Burmese era 1106, as well as of the future [[Taungpila Sayadaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first= John |last=Ferguson |title= Essays on Burma|url=https://books.google.com.mm/booksid=Ug4VAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=Bo+Bo+Aung&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XC3wJyf57I&amp;sig=dEUi0I6G18vGpxfmBIjgV0rCSVA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5j4_6lsXWAhVBO48KHZcfAlgQ6AEIXjAP#v=onepage&amp;q=Bo%20Bo%20Aung&amp;f=false?}},&lt;/ref&gt;  Aung's name at birth was Pho Aung.  His father was Pho Myat San and his mother was Mae Nyein Yar. Due to his parent's lack of financial resources, Aung was malnourished as a child. Consequently, he suffered from skin disease and was taunted by his peers, who called him "Maung Wei". "Maung" means "teenage boy" and  "wei" being a Burmese word for scabies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://weizzarlan.blogspot.com/2009/07/bo-bo-aung-weizzar-with-white-robe.html|title= Bo Bo Aung Weizzar|accessdate=2017-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Sayadaw's dream===

One day, while the [[Kye Ni Sayadaw]] was having a nap, he dreamed that he was woken by a holy man dressed in white. In the dream, the man in white led him to the lake at the back of the monastery, gestured to a specific area of the lake, then disappeared. When the Sayadaw awoke, he felt as if the dream were real.  Days later, he was thinking about his dream and went out to the lake to look again at the spot the white robed man pointed to.   When he reached the edge of the lake he felt something in the water under a tree. It was a copper manuscript. He washed it off and took it to the monastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://weizzarlan.blogspot.com/2009/07/bo-bo-aung-weizzar-with-white-robe.html|title= Bo Bo Aung Weizzar|accessdate=2017-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The dirty pillow===

Not long after this, the Sayadaw passed away.  He was cremated and his remains were entombed and his three main disciples began to divide his possessions.   The new Sayadaw jokingly threw an old pillow to Aung, and told him that that was his inheritance from the former Sayadaw.  Out of respect, Aung accepted it. He used it to balance his elbow while he wrote on the floor.  The pillow eventually began to tear and he saw that there was something hard inside the pillow.  Later, he overheard some wise men discussing the lost copper manuscript of the former Sayardaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://weizzarlan.blogspot.com/2009/07/bo-bo-aung-weizzar-with-white-robe.html|title= Bo Bo Aung Weizzar|accessdate=2017-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attempted assassination==

When Aung became a powerful weizza, his old classmate, King [[Bodawpaya]] attempted to have him assassinated because he refused to acknowledge him as the future [[Maitreya|Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first= John |last=Ferguson |title= Essays on Burma|url=https://books.google.com.mm/booksid=Ug4VAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=Bo+Bo+Aung&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XC3wJyf57I&amp;sig=dEUi0I6G18vGpxfmBIjgV0rCSVA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5j4_6lsXWAhVBO48KHZcfAlgQ6AEIXjAP#v=onepage&amp;q=Bo%20Bo%20Aung&amp;f=false?}},&lt;/ref&gt;  First, he sent a team of soldiers to find Aung.  The soldiers begged him to return when them, saying that they would be killed if they failed the king.  Aung ordered the soldiers to send a report to the king that they had captured him and put him in chains at the bottom of their boat.  He promised them that he would appear in the boat when it arrived at the capital.

The soldiers did as he said. When their boat reached the capital two weeks later, they found Aung lying at the bottom of the boat tied in chains. King [[Bodawpaya]] gathered his people to witness the execution. He ordered the executioners to throw Aung into a deep ditch and buried him alive. Later that evening, when [[Bodawpaya]] was meeting with his ministers, Bo Bo Aung appeared. He told the king that he was a false friends and reminded him that they had sworn eternal friendship to each other. He told him that he did not want to take over his kingdom.   He wrote a circle in chalk on the palace floor and presented a challenge to the king.  He told the king to erase the chalk drawing from the floor. The King, full of shame and anger, rubbed out the circle but then two more appeared.   He continued to try to erase the chalk circles until the whole palace floor was covered with hundreds of them.  Aung again chided the king, who begged him to protect his family.  Aung vowed to do that and then vanished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tuninst.net/FLK-ELE/ch05-magus/ch05-magus.htm|title=Folk Elements|accessdate=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Many Burmese Buddhists believe that Aung never died, but remains on earth to wait for the coming of the next Buddha and protect the [[Dharma]].{{sfn|Ferguson|Mendelson|1981||pp=62–4}} They believe that he is available to help pious laypeople in their daily struggles.  He is often accompanied by a statue of [[Bo Min Gaung]], another prominent weizzas, on Buddhist alters in Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first= John |last=Ferguson |title= Essays on Burma|url=https://books.google.com.mm/booksid=Ug4VAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=Bo+Bo+Aung&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XC3wJyf57I&amp;sig=dEUi0I6G18vGpxfmBIjgV0rCSVA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5j4_6lsXWAhVBO48KHZcfAlgQ6AEIXjAP#v=onepage&amp;q=Bo%20Bo%20Aung&amp;f=false?}},&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Freedom Movement===

In the first half of the twentieth century, many Burmese associated Aung with the Freedom Movement against British colonization. The movement sought to draw on his mystical weizzas powers. Bogyoke [[Aung San]] (the father of [[Aung San Suu Kyi]]) was considered to have been the reincarnation of Aung.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.michaelbackmanltd.com/998.html|title=Michael Backman Ltd ., Bo Bo Aung|accessdate=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Afrikaner Commandos2.JPG|thumb|right| ]]
The '''Boer commandos'''  or "'''Kommandos'''" were volunteer military units of [[guerilla]] [[militia]] organized by the [[Boer]] people of [[South Africa]]. The term came into English usage during the [[Second Boer War]] of 1899-1902.

==History==
[[File:Boers 1881.gif|thumb|left|Boer Commando in action during the [[First Boer War]], 1881]]
In 1658, war erupted between the Dutch settlers at [[Cape Colony]] and the [[Khoi-khoi]]. In order to protect the settlement, all able bodied men were conscripted. After the conclusion of this war, all men in the colony were liable for [[military service]] and were expected to be ready on short notice.

By 1700, the size of the colony had increased immensely and it was divided into districts. The small military garrison stationed at the [[Castle de Goede Hoop]] couldn't be counted on to react swiftly in the border districts, therefore the [[commando system]] was expanded and formalized. Each district had a [[Kommandant]] who was charged with calling up all [[citizen|burghers]] in times of need. In 1795, with the [[Battle of Muizenberg|First British Occupation]] and again in 1806 with the [[Battle of Blaauwberg|Second British Occupation]], the commandos were called up to defend the Cape Colony. At the [[Battle of Blaauwberg]] (6 January 1806), the [[Swellendam Commando]] held the British off long enough for the rest of the Batavian army to retreat to safety.

Under British rule, the [[Cape Colony]] continued to use the commando system in its [[Xhosa Wars|frontier wars]], in addition to regular British imperial troops. Boer commandos fought alongside [[Fengu]], [[1820 Settlers|British settlers]], [[Khoi-khoi]] and other ethnic groups in units which were often mixed. Light, mobile commandos were undeniably better-suited than the slow-moving columns of imperial troops, for warfare in the rough frontier mountains. However, tensions often arose in the Cape's government over the relative merits and control of these two parallel military systems.&lt;ref&gt;RD staff (1996). ''Xhosa Wars''. Reader's Digest Family Encyclopedia of World History. The Reader's Digest Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Great Trek]], this system was used and remained in use in the [[Boer republics]]. Both republics issued commando laws, making commando service mandatory in times of need for all male citizens between the ages of 16 and 60.
During the [[Anglo-Boer War]] (1899–1902) the Boer commando formed the backbone of the Boer forces.

After the declaration of peace in 1902, the commandos were disbanded. They did reform themselves in clandestine "shooting clubs". In 1912, the commandos were reformed as an Active Citizen Force in the [[Union Defence Force (South Africa)|Union Defence Force]]. This system was in operation until 2005, when all commandos were disbanded again.

==Structure==
[[File:1899 Boer Commando - Pretoria.jpg|thumb|right|The Commando assembled from [[Pretoria]] in 1899]]
[[File:Boer Commandos - with British Prisoners - Boer War.jpg|thumb|right|Boer Commando with captured British prisoners during the Anglo-Boer War (1899–1902)]]
Each commando was attached to a town, after which it was named (e.g. Bloemfontein Commando). Each town was responsible for a district, divided into wards. The commando was commanded by a [[kommandant]] and each ward by a [[veldkornet]] or field cornet (equivalent of a senior [[Officer (armed forces)|NCO]] rank)

The veldkornet was responsible not only for calling up the burghers, but also for policing his ward, collecting taxes, issuing firearms and other [[materiel]] in times of war. Theoretically, a ward was divided into corporalships. A corporalship was usually made up of about 20 burghers. Sometimes entire families (fathers, sons, uncles, cousins) filled a corporalship.

The veldkornet was responsible to the kommandant, who in turn was responsible to a general. In theory, a general was responsible for four commandos. He in turn was responsible to the commander-in-chief of the republic. In the Transvaal, the C-in-C was called the [[Commandant-General]] and in the Free State the ''Hoofdkommandant'' (Chief Commandant). The C-in-C was responsible to the president.

Other auxiliary ranks were created in war time, such as ''vleiskorporaal'' ("meat corporal"), responsible for issuing rations.

The commando was made up of volunteers, all officers were appointed by the members of the commando, and not by the government. This gave a chance for some commanders to appear, such as [[Koos de la Rey|General Koos de la Rey]] and [[Christiaan de Wet|General C. R. de Wet]], but also had the disadvantage of sometimes putting inept commanders in charge. Discipline was also a problem, as there was no real way of enforcing it.

The various Boer republics did not all have the same command structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angloboerwar.com/forces/boer_commando.htm Angloboerwar website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726112009/http://angloboerwar.com/forces/boer_commando.htm |date=2009-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weaponry==
Before the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], the two Boer republics had permanent artillery units (e.g. the [[Transvaalse Staatsartillerie]]), equipped with [[Krupp]] or [[155 mm Creusot Long Tom|Creusot]] artillery.{{cn|date=April 2017}} From the early days, the commandos were issued with firearms by the government of the day.{{Dubious|Weaponry|date=August 2010}} The burghers were obliged to keep these firearms serviceable and ready at all times. 

In the [[Anglo-Boer War]], most burghers were issued with the modern, clip-loading [[Mauser]] rifle, but a range of weapons were in use, including:

*[[Mauser C96]] pistol
*[[Colt Single Action Army]] revolver
*[[Remington Model 1875]] revolver
*[[Remington Rolling Block rifle|Remington Rolling Block]] rifle
*[[Winchester rifle|Winchester]] rifle

'''Carl Ray''' (January 10, 1943 – September 26, 1978) was a [[First Nations]] artist who was active on the Canadian art scene from 1969 until his death in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth McLuhan, Tom Hill, "Norval Morrisseau and the Emergence of the Image Makes", Art Gallery of Ontario, Methuan, Toronto, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  Considered primarily a [[Woodlands Style]] artist, he also painted European style wildlife and landscapes.  He was a founding member of the [[Indian Group of Seven]]. He began painting when he was 30 years old.

==Biography==
Self-taught artist Carl Ray was born on January 10, 1943 on the [[Sandy Lake First Nation]] reserve in northern Ontario, Canada&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/carl-ray/&lt;/ref&gt; and was known in his [[Cree]] community as Tall Straight Poplar (he was 6'4" tall) where he hunted and trapped after leaving residential school at fifteen following the death of his father.  At this traditional way of living he was a failure - in Carl's own words years later: "a year's catch consisted of four [[beaver]], one [[lynx]], and an assortment of [[mice]] and [[rabbits]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Department of Education Newsletter, "Communicating Indian Culture through art", 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite showing artistic promise at an early age, Carl was reluctant to break the [[taboo]] of painting the sacred beliefs and stories of his people.  He did not touch a brush or paint for many years after having been admonished by his elders for doing so.

He eventually left the reserve to work in the [[Red Lake, Ontario|Red Lake]] gold mines where his drinking and guitar playing abilities earned him the nickname [[Ira Hayes]].  However, his excesses caught up with him and he contracted [[tuberculosis]], eventually recovered in [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]] and returned home in 1966.  It was not until then that [[Norval Morrisseau]]'s success in breaking the painting taboos allowed Carl to confidently pursue his craft, which in many cases, included "legend painting" and painting wildlife and northern scenic landscapes.

He apprenticed under [[Norval Morrisseau]] (who had already achieved national and international acclaim) and worked on the mural for the Indians of Canada Pavilion of Expo '67 in Montreal.  Norval had designed and sketched the mural but it was Carl who did most of the work and was left to finish it.&lt;ref&gt;Lister Sinclair, Jack H. Pollock, "The Art of Norval Morrisseau", Methuen, Toronto, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately this masterpiece is lost as it was left to fall into disrepair and was eventually demolished years later.

As well as translating the legends, Carl also created a large and impressive group of illustrations for James Stevens' book "Legends of the Sandy Lake Cree" in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Stevens, Carl Ray, "Legends of the Sandy Lake Cree", McClelland &amp; Stewart, Toronto, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Stevens reported that Carl "perceived this reversion to a more austere style as a loss of face" &lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth McLuhan, Tom Hill, "Norval Morrisseau and the Emergence of the Image Makes", Art Gallery of Ontario, Methuan, Toronto, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the illustrations would somewhat haunt him since it was now the kind of work that was expected of him in certain markets.

With the help of Ontario Department of Education Superintendent Robert Lavack, Carl embarked on a tour teaching art at schools in northern communities including Kirkland Lake, Timmins, Blind River, Wawa, Bruce Mines, Manitoulin Island, Sudbury, Levack, North Bay, Bracebridge, Oshawa and Whitby.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lavack, Hazel Fulford, "The Morrisseau Papers - An Inside Story" Perdida, Press, Thunder Bay, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Carl also taught at the Manitou Arts Foundation on Schreiber Island in 1971.  The following year the department of Indian Affairs sponsored the tour through northern communities and reserves.

Carl continued to develop and paint through the mid 70's completing notable large scale mural opportunities at schools and the Sioux Lookout Fellowship and Communications Centre as well as smaller works becoming more and more popular with white buyers. In the early 1970s Ray had the first solo exhibition of his black and sepia, Woodlands style paintings on paper and canvas at Aggregation Gallery in Toronto. Aggregation Gallery continued to represent his work and estate through to the early 80's.  By 1975, the [[Indian Group of Seven]] had formed and Ray was enjoying acclaim and purchases by notable collectors such as Dr. Peter Lewin and Dr. Bernard Cinader, as well as public institutions such as the [[McMichael Canadian Art Collection]].  He also illustrated the cover of "The White City" published by Tom Marshall in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Marshall, "The White City", Oberon Press, Canada, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of Carl's art was influenced by his often troubled personal life and inner demons and excesses.

Carl was known by his peers as a man of general good humour.  He was also known as somewhat of a jokester as described by fellow painter [[Alex Janvier]]: "Carl Ray was the guy who could laugh, make fun of you, throw a joke on you and he'd laugh his head off".&lt;ref&gt;The Life and Work of the Woodland Artists - Interview with Alex Janvier, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl Ray was murdered, stabbed to death, as a result of a drunken brawl over money in [[Sioux Lookout]] in 1978.  He was only 35 years old.&lt;ref&gt;The Globe and Mail, Toronto, September 28, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a note to Carl Ray by George Kenny after his death he wrote "I wonder if those paintings you painted ever satisfied your demons that drove you to paint…Didn't you realize that fame only comes at the meeting of one of those demons – DEATH? ….Now we'll never know the extent of your greatness…" &lt;ref&gt;Mary E. Southcott, "The Sound of the Drum - The Sacred Art of the Anishnabec", Boston Mills Press, Erin, Ontario, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
Carl Ray is best known for his work executed in the style of the [[Woodlands Style|Woodlands School]] (often referred to as "legend painting" style).  [[File:taboo island.jpg|thumb|right|''Taboo Island'' by Ray, 1972]]

Lacking sophisticated technique, but resplendent with powerful imagery, his super-realistic images were unique, and his signature style is easily recognized.  Describing his work, Carl stated "What you are looking at is ancient and sacred. In fact what you see could be described as a part of my soul".&lt;ref&gt;Mary E. Southcott, "The Sound of the Drum - The Sacred Art of the Anishnabec", Boston Mills Press, Erin, Ontario, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; The spiritual and emotional commitment he put into his work was substantial - "his (work) came from a very deep journey, a lot of people are afraid to make that journey" &lt;ref&gt;The Life and Work of the Woodland Artists - Interview with Bob Boyer, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of his works were limited to two or three colours, brown, black and blue, often mixing ink and watercolours.

His lesser known, but equally powerful scenic western style canvases were also a large part of Carl's repertoire.  Often ensconced in hues of electric blue, he captured the wildlife and beauty of the Sandy Lake area.  He also combined the two styles on occasion, capturing his imaginative images of Cree legends in full electrifying colour.

Moore was born in [[Los Angeles, California]], the son of Nora Eileen (Orr) and John Richard Moore Sr., a banker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XcwdAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22John+R.+and+Nora+Eileen+(Orr)+Moore%22&amp;dq=%22John+R.+and+Nora+Eileen+(Orr)+Moore%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAGoVChMIvpXV6uzwxwIVTAuSCh1vDgHP|title=Hollywood Players: The Thirties|first1=James Robert|last1=Parish|first2=William T.|last2=Leonard|date=January 29, 1976|publisher=Arlington House|accessdate=January 29, 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Irish, and his paternal grandparents were from England and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XCV4-G6J] {{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z43kS7QQOMkC&amp;pg=PA289&amp;lpg=PA289&amp;dq=%22dogs+and+that+his+mother+was+Irish+and+took+great%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZB0xfa7d6Y&amp;sig=JBO7lf070FwZwXIzGaI4Rgaxe2M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAGoVChMI2fqjse3wxwIVlhGSCh3LmwMl|title=A Life of Barbara Stanwyck: Steel-True 1907-1940|first=Victoria|last=Wilson|date=November 12, 2013|publisher=Simon and Schuster|accessdate=January 29, 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He made his film debut in 1927 in the silent film ''[[The Beloved Rogue]]'', where he portrayed silent film star [[John Barrymore]]'s character as a one-year-old baby. At the time of his death, Moore was one of the last surviving actors to have appeared in [[silent film]]. He quickly gained notable supporting roles. He had a significant role as [[Marlene Dietrich]]'s son in [[Josef von Sternberg]]'s drama ''[[Blonde Venus]]'' (1932). He also appeared with [[Barbara Stanwyck]] in ''[[So Big (1932 film)|So Big]]'' (1932), with [[Walter Huston]] in ''[[Gabriel Over the White House]]'' (1933) and with [[Spencer Tracy]] in ''[[Man's Castle]]'' (1933).

Besides appearing in a number of major feature films, he was featured as a regular in the ''[[Our Gang]]'' series during the 1932–1933 season. Although he only played in eight ''Our Gang'' films, in those films he played an important role as the leader of the gang. He left the series after one year to play in more feature films. In addition to his ''Our Gang'' work, Moore is most remembered for his portrayal of the title character in the [[Oliver Twist (1933 film)|1933 adaptation]] of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Oliver Twist]]''.{{cn|date=September 2018}} 

In 1935, he played the historical role of [[Joseph Meister]] in ''[[The Story of Louis Pasteur]]'' about the life of scientist [[Louis Pasteur]]. In 1941, he portrayed the brother of [[Gary Cooper]] in the war drama ''[[Sergeant York (film)|Sergeant York]]'' under the direction of [[Howard Hawks]]. He is also famous for giving [[Shirley Temple]] her first romantic onscreen kiss, in the film ''[[Miss Annie Rooney]]''.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Moore was less successful as a teenage actor and young adult and he often had to play in B-movies such as ''[[Dangerous Years]]'' during the 1940s. One of his last notable film roles was in ''[[Out of the Past]]'' (1947), in which he portrayed [[Robert Mitchum]]'s deaf young assistant, "The Kid". Moore played his last role as a young soldier in ''[[Eight Iron Men]]'' (1952). He later performed on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], in stock and on television. He went on to teach and write books about acting, edit Equity News, and produce an Oscar-nominated short film (''The Boy and the Eagle''), and industrial films. He retired from acting in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="DMoore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/us/ohio/elyria/elyria-chronicle-telegram/1984/10-18/page-16|title=Child stars|publisher=Elyria Chronicle Telegram|date=October 18, 1984|accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1966, after battling alcohol and drugs, he founded a public relations firm, Dick Moore and Associates, which he ran until 2010.&lt;ref name="guard-obit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bergan|first1=Ronald|title=Dickie Moore obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/15/dickie-moore|accessdate=September 16, 2018|work=The Guardian|date=September 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In 1984, Moore published ''Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star (But Don't Have Sex or Take the Car)'', a book about his and others' experiences as child actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/twinkle-twinkle-little-star-but-dont-have-sex-or-take-the-car/oclc/10779338&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Twinkle, twinkle, little star: but don't have sex or take the car|work=worldcat.org|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore owned a public relations firm, Dick Moore and Associates.  Founded in 1966, it existed for 44 years.  From 1988 until his death in 2015 Moore was married to the actress [[Jane Powell]].  The two met when Moore interviewed Powell for ''Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star''.&lt;ref name="lawler19861016"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1986-10-16/entertainment/2555168_1_girl-next-door-screen-kiss-hollywood-illusion|title=Jane Powell Finally Has Learned How To Get Off The Treadmill|work=The Morning Call|date=1986-10-16|accessdate=April 22, 2012|author=Lawler, Sylvia|location=Allentown, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The couple lived in [[Manhattan]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=bulletin&gt;Thomas, Nick.

Early in her career she had been the chair of the Gambia National Women's Council and an advisor to [[Dawda Jawara]], the first [[President of the Gambia]] as a nation [[Gambia Independence Act 1964|independent]] from the [[Gambia Colony and Protectorate|colonial rule]] of the [[British Empire]]. After the [[1994 Gambian coup d'état|military ''coup d'état'']] in July 1994 that deposed the Jawara government, she held the post of Secretary of State for Health and Social Welfare from 1994 to 1995 in the cabinet of the [[Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council]].

She was appointed as Vice-President by Barrow in January 2017, but was found ineligible due to constitutional age restrictions. She was instead made Minister of Women's Affairs overseeing the office of Vice-President, until the constitution was changed and she was formally sworn in as Vice-President in November 2017. Prior to her appointment, she had served as chair of [[Coalition 2016]], the alliance of opposition political parties that had supported Barrow's candidacy in the [[Gambian presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]].

Tambajang joined the [[United Democratic Party (Gambia)|United Democratic Party]] (UDP) in April 2015, during the Fass stand-off with security forces.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gainako.com/gambias-vibrant-female-political-aspirant-speaks/|title=Gambia's Vibrant Female political Aspirant speaks|last=|first=|date=23 April 2015|work=Gainako|access-date=23 January 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tambajang was a senior member of [[Coalition 2016]], the alliance of political opposition parties that supported Barrow in the [[Gambian presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], and she also served as its chair. Following President [[Yahya Jammeh]]'s defeat in the election, Tambajang declared that Jammeh would be prosecuted within a year. She also announced the creation of a national commission for asset recovery in order to reclaim what had allegedly been lost through corruption during Jammeh's tenure. On Jammeh, she told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that "He can't leave. If he leaves, he's going to escape us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/07/the-gambias-new-rulers-vow-to-prosecute-outgoing-president |title=The Gambia's new rulers vow to prosecute outgoing president |last=Maclean |first=Ruth |date=7 December 2016 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=23 January 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process of appointment to the Vice-Presidency ===
Following Barrow's inauguration on 19 January 2017, on 23 January it was announced that Tambajang would serve as his [[Vice-President of the Gambia|Vice-President]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.africanews.com/2017/01/23/the-gambia-president-barrow-picks-female-vice-president/|title=President Barrow picks female Vice President|last=|first=|date=23 January 2017|work=Africa News|access-date=23 January 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after her selection, it was suggested that she was constitutionally ineligible to take on the role. This was because section 62(1)(b) of the [[Constitution of the Gambia]] states that the Vice-President must meet the same age requirement as the President, establishing a maximum age of 65 at the time of entering the office – whereas Tambajang was reported to be 67 at the time of her selection.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Following the reports, she was not sworn in immediately to the post, although she disputed the reported age – saying she was only 64 years old.&lt;ref name=Scandal&gt;{{cite news|url=http://saharareporters.com/2017/02/07/new-gambian-vice-president-fatoumata-tambajang-age-falsification-scandal|title=New Gambian Vice President, Fatoumata Tambajang, In Age Falsification Scandal|publisher=[[Sahara Reporters]] |date=7 February 2017|access-date=10 February 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrow challenged the public to show proof that she was above age 65.&lt;ref name=Scandal/&gt; In February, she was appointed as [[Minister of Women's Affairs (The Gambia)|Minister of Women's Affairs]], with oversight of the vice-president's office.&lt;ref name=Appoints5&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thepoint.gm/africa/gambia/article/barrow-appoints-five-new-ministers |title=Barrow appoints five new ministers |work=[[The Point (the Gambia)|The Point]] |date=23 February 2017 |accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February 2017, the [[National Assembly of the Gambia|National Assembly]] tried to approve a change to the constitution to eliminate the age limit.&lt;ref name=AFPscraps&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Daily Nation]] |url=http://www.nation.co.ke/news/africa/Gambia-scraps-age-limit-/1066-3831954-ct65ja/ |title=Gambia scraps age limit for presidential candidates |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=1 March 2017 |accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Halifa Sallah]], the spokesman for the transitional government and an advisor to President Barrow, said that the proper procedure had not been followed for amending the constitution, and that the action needed to be revisited and such a change would take an additional several months to properly accomplish (according to section 226 of the constitution).&lt;ref name=WillCorrect&gt;{{cite news |first=Pa |last=Nderry M'Bai |url=http://www.freedomnewspaper.com/gambia-breaking-news-govt-will-correct-the-unconstitutional-repealing-of-the-presidential-age-limit-without-following-the-dictates-of-the-law-halifa-sallah/ |title=Gov't will Correct the Unconstitutional Repealing of the Presidential Age Limit; Without Following the Dictates of the Law – Halifa Sallah |work=Freedom Newspaper |date=4 March 2017 |accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 62 was amended by [[National Assembly of the Gambia]] on 25 July with the presidential age-limit being removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thepoint.gm/africa/gambia/article/presidential-age-limit-removed|title=Presidential age-limit removed|publisher=[[The Point (the Gambia)|The Point]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her appointment as Vice-President was confirmed by the President on 8 September and after finalization of her appointment, she was expected to be sworn-in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.freedomnewspaper.com/gambia-vp-overseer-fatoumatta-jallow-tambajang-finally-confirmed-as-gambias-vice-president/ |title=Gambia: VP Overseer Fatoumatta Jallow Tambajang Finally Confirmed As Gambia’s Vice President! |work=Freedom Newspaper |date=8 September 2017 |accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Barrow announced officially appointing her as Vice-President on 9 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.africanews.com/2017/11/10/barrow-appoints-fatoumata-jallow-tambajang/ |title=Gambian president swears in female vice Jallow-Tambajang |work=Africanews |date=10 November 2017 |accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gabriela "Gaby" Raquel Brimmer''' (September 12, 1947 – January 2, 2000), was a writer and activist for persons with disabilities. She was born in [[Mexico City]], the daughter of Sari and Michel Brimmer, Austrian Jewish immigrants. She had a brother, David.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/12429/disabled-writer-whose-life-inspired-film-bio-dies-at-52/ Gaby Brimmer obituary] accessed 5/21/2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988-04-15/features/8801230736_1_gaby-brimmer-mexico-city-gabriela-brimmer Gabriela Brimmer chronicle] accessed 5/21/2015&lt;/ref&gt; Gaby was born with [[cerebral palsy]] and since childhood learned to act in a world that has difficulty accepting diversity. Brimmer's caretaker, [[Florencia Sánchez Morales]], was largely responsible for teaching her to communicate. Brimmer's life was chronicled in the film ''[[Gaby: A True Story]]''. In 1979, her Spanish-language autobiography ''Gaby Brimmer,''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Gaby-Brimmer-Spanish/dp/9684191014 Spanish-version ''Gaby Brimmer'']&lt;/ref&gt; coauthored by [[Elena_Poniatowska|Elena Poniatowska]], was published by Editorial Grijalbo in Mexico City. An English version translated by Trudy Balch appeared in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Gaby_Brimmer.html?id=KxwSbEnjvPsC English-version ''Gaby Brimmer'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and early life ==
In 1955, she was enrolled into a rehabilitation center's elementary school where a teacher recognized her talent with words and recommended that she become a writer. In 1967, Brimmer entered a regular school. Her [[Language Arts]] teacher was a poet who also persuaded her to write. That very same year she started to write poems. The first time her mother read one of her poems she was deeply moved, cried and asked her to keep them all so that a book could be published. Brimmer could only type on the [[typewriter]] with a toe from her left foot, the only part of her body she could control. In 1971, she was accepted into the Social and Political Sciences department at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] as a [[Sociology]] Major, but did not graduate.

== Gabriela Brimmer Foundation ==
Gaby founded an organization of people with disabilities, known as Asociación para los Derechos de Personas con Alteraciones Motoras ([[Adepam]]) (in English, Association for the Rights of People with Motor Disabilities) and was an active participant in numerous other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanaejournal.hu/vol6no1/kelemen-review REVIEW OF ''Gaby Brimmer: An Autobiography in Three Voices'' by Zsolt Kelemen]&lt;/ref&gt; Brimmer worked for the full participation of people with disabilities and at the same time managed to write poetry. Brimmer was regarded{{Who|date=November 2010}} as one who enjoyed a moving sensitivity and a strength that stemmed from the depths of her soul. Observers of her life{{Who|date=November 2010}} commented that she did not think of herself as an "outstanding personality,"{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} even when people{{Who|date=November 2010}} could not hide their astonishment in seeing her do the things she did. She used to say, "life makes me to do it. Her message to people with disabilities was to rethink their ways of living by forgetting the limits imposed by others.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

      <comment>The article states 'Beginning in the second half of the 1880s, he published articles in various fields [...] displaying the influence of Aristotle, as well as Hippolyte Taine and Ernest Renan. [...] His social and political philosophy owed much to his reading of Proudhon, Karl Marx, Giambattista Vico, Henri Bergson[8][9] (whose lectures at the Collège de France he attended), and later William James'.

'''Georges Eugène Sorel''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|l}}; {{IPA-fr|sɔʁɛl|lang}}; 2 November 1847 &amp;ndash; 29 August 1922) was a French [[philosopher]]&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, J. Ramsay (1912). [https://archive.org/stream/syndicalismcriti00macduoft#page/16/mode/2up "The Philosophy of Sorel."] In: ''Syndicalism: A Critical Examination''. London: Constable &amp; Co., Ltd., pp. 16–23.&lt;/ref&gt; and theorist of [[Sorelianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy-Grand, Georges (1911). [https://archive.org/stream/laphilosophiesyn00guyguoft#page/6/mode/2up "M. Georges Sorel et le 'Matérialisme Historique'."] In: ''La Philosophie Syndicaliste''.

Fisher Unwin, pp. 37–94.&lt;/ref&gt; His notion of the power of [[mythology|myth]]  in people's lives (in particular, [[national myth]]) inspired [[Socialism|socialists]], [[Anarchism|anarchists]], [[Marxism|Marxists]], and [[Fascism|Fascists]].&lt;ref&gt;Sternhell, Zeev, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri (1994).

Princeton University Press {{ISBN|0-691-03289-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, together with his defense of violence, the contribution for which he is most often remembered.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Kract, Klaus Gross (2008). "[http://www.zeithistorische-forschungen.de/16126041-GrosseKracht-1-2008 Georges Sorel und der Mythos der Gewalt.]" ''Zeithistorische Forschungen/Studies in Contemporary History'', No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Cherbourg]] as the son of a bankrupted wine merchant, he moved to Paris in 1864 to attend the [[Collège-lycée Jacques-Decour|Collège Rollin]], before entering the [[École Polytechnique]] a year later.&lt;ref&gt;Gervasoni, Marco (1997). ''Georges Sorel, Una Biografia Intellettuale''. Milan: Edizioni Unicopli. {{ISBN|8840004920}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He became chief [[engineer]] with the [[Public works|Department of Public Works]], stationed briefly in Corsica, and for a longer period in [[Perpignan]]. In 1891, he was awarded the Légion d'honneur.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, Jeremy (1985). ''Georges Sorel: The Character and Development of his Thought''. New York: St. Martin's Press, p. 16 {{ISBN|0-312-32458-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired in 1892 and moved to [[Boulogne-sur-Seine]], near Paris, where he stayed until his death.

Beginning in the second half of the 1880s, he published articles in various fields (hydrology, architecture, physics, political history, and philosophy) displaying the influence of [[Aristotle]], as well as [[Hippolyte Taine]] and [[Ernest Renan]]. In 1893, he publicly affirmed his position as a Marxist and a socialist. His social and political philosophy owed much to his reading of [[Proudhon]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Giambattista Vico]], [[Henri Bergson]]&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy, Arthur O. (1913). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2376914 "The Practical Tendencies of Bergsonism, II."] ''International Journal of Ethics'', Vol. 23, No. 4, pp. 419–443.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, James Jay (1973). "Georges Sorel and the Inconsistencies of a Bergsonian Marxism", ''Political Theory'', Vol. 1, No. 3, pp. 329–340.&lt;/ref&gt; (whose lectures at the [[Collège de France]] he attended), and later [[William James]]. Sorel's engagement in the political world was accompanied by a correspondence with [[Benedetto Croce]], and later with [[Vilfredo Pareto]]. Sorel worked on the first French Marxist journals, ''L’Ère nouvelle'' and ''Le Devenir social'', and then participated at the turn of the century in the revisionist debate and crisis within Marxism.  He took the side of [[Eduard Bernstein]] against [[Karl Kautsky]]. Sorel supported acquittal during the [[Dreyfus affair]], although, like his friend [[Charles Péguy]], he later felt betrayed by what he saw as the opportunism of the Dreyfusards. Through his contributions to Enrico Leone's ''Il Divenire sociale'' and [[Hubert Lagardelle]]'s ''Mouvement socialiste'', he contributed around 1905 to the theoretical elaboration of revolutionary syndicalism.&lt;ref&gt;Neilson, Francis (1919). [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924030259281#page/n93/mode/2up "Georges Sorel and Syndicalism."] In: ''The Old Freedom''. New York: B. W. Huebsch, pp. 78–94.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, his most famous text, ''[[Reflections on Violence]]'', appeared in this last journal. It was published in book form in 1908, and was followed the same year by ''Illusions du Progrès''.

Disappointed by the [[Confédération Générale du Travail]] (CGT), Sorel associated himself for a period in 1909-1910 with [[Charles Maurras]]’ [[Action française]], while sharing neither its nationalism nor its political program. This collaboration inspired the founders of the [[Cercle Proudhon]], which brought together revolutionary syndicalists and monarchists. Sorel himself, with Jean Variot, founded a journal in 1911 called ''L'Indépendance'', although disagreements, in part over nationalism, soon ended the project.&lt;ref&gt;
Roman, Thomas (2001). [http://www.cairn.info/article_p.php?ID_ARTICLE=MNC_020_0173 "L'Independance. Une Revue Traditionaliste"], ''Mil-neuf-cent''. No. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferociously opposed to the 1914 [[Union sacrée]], Sorel denounced the war and in 1917 praised the Russian Revolution, which was later printed in an official Soviet Union publication, [[w:Russian Soviet Government Bureau|Russian Soviet Government Bureau]], calling Lenin "the greatest theoretician of socialism since Marx and a statesman whose genius recalls that of Peter the Great."&lt;ref&gt;Georges Sorel, "For Lenin," ''Soviet Russia'', Official Organ of The Russian Soviet Government Bureau, Vol. II, New York: NY, January–June 1920 (April 10, 1920) p. 356  [https://books.google.com/books?id=PgkEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA352&amp;lpg=PA352&amp;dq=%22the+greatest+theoretician+of+Socialism+since+Marx,%E2%80%A6%E2%80%9D+%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nRdiZoF1_X&amp;sig=Lyp1Mtj-ouBFsKtawz_9Bsd9K-Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIz77OgYfTAhVMxWMKHT_RCnUQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20greatest%20theoretician%20of%20Socialism%20since%20Marx%2C%E2%80%A6%E2%80%9D%20%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote numerous small pieces for Italian newspapers defending the [[Bolsheviks]]. Less than one year later in March 1921, Sorel turned his praise towards a rising Fascist leader in Italy, writing that "Mussolini is a man no less extraordinary than Lenin. He, too, is a political genius, of a greater reach than all the statesmen of the day, with the only exception of Lenin…"&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Jacob Talmon|Jacob L. Talmon]], ''The Myth of the Nation and the Vision of Revolution: The Origins of Ideological Polarization in the 20th Century'', University of California Press (1981) p. 451. Sorel’s March 1921 conversations with Jean Variot, published in Variot’s ''Propos de Georges Sorel'', (1935) Paris, pp. 53-57, 66-86 passim&lt;/ref&gt; Inexplicably, Sorel found it necessary to heap praise on both a Russian Bolshevik and an Italian Fascist leader almost concurrently.

Sorel was extremely hostile to [[Gabriele D’Annunzio]], the poet who attempted to re-conquer [[Fiume]] for Italy, and did not show sympathy for the rise of fascism in Italy, despite Jean Variot's later claims that he placed all his hopes in [[Benito Mussolini]].  After the war, Sorel published a collection of his writings entitled ''Matériaux d’une Théorie du Prolétariat''. At the time of his death, in [[Boulogne sur Seine]], he had an ambivalent attitude towards both Fascism and [[Bolshevism]].

Although his writing touched on many subjects, Sorel's work is best characterized by his original interpretation of Marxism, which was deeply anti-determinist, politically anti-elitist, anti-Jacobin,&lt;ref&gt;"One can say that optimists are, in general, extremist theoreticians. The consequences of this have been well put by Georges Sorel in writing of the Jacobins: 'If, unfortunately, they find themselves armed with great political power allowing them to realize an ideal that they have conceived, optimists may lead their country to worse catastrophes. They are not long in recognizing, indeed, that social transformations are not achieved with the facility they had expected; they attribute their disappointments to their contemporaries, rather than explain the march of events in terms of historic necessity; thus they end by attempting to remove those people whose evil desires seem to them dangerous to the welfare of mankind. During the Terror, the men who spilt most blood were exactly those who had the keenest desire to enable their fellow-creatures to enjoy the golden age of which they had dreamed, and who had the strongest sympathy for human misery. Optimistic, idealistic, and sensitive, 
as they were, these men showed themselves the more inexorable as they had a greater thirst for universal well-being'." —  Michels, Robert (1949). [https://archive.org/stream/firstlecturesinp00mich#page/134/mode/2up "The Sociological Character of Political Parties."] In: ''First Lectures in Political Sociology''. University of Minnesota Press, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; and built on the direct action of unions, the mobilizing role of myth—especially that of the general strike—and on the disruptive and regenerative role of violence. Whether Sorel is better seen as a [[left-wing]] or [[right-wing]] thinker is disputed:&lt;ref&gt;Wilde, Larry (1986). "Sorel and the French Right," ''History of Political Thought'', Vol. VII, pp. 361-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schecter, Darrow (1990). "Two Views of Revolution: Gramsci and Sorel," ''History of European Ideas,'' Vol. XII, pp. 637-53.&lt;/ref&gt; the Italian Fascists praised him as a forefather, but the dictatorial government they established ran contrary to his beliefs, while he was also an important touchstone for Italy's first [[Communists]], who saw Sorel as a theorist of the proletariat.  Such widely divergent interpretations arise from the theory that a moral revival of the country must take place to re-establish itself, saving it from decadence;&lt;ref&gt;"Sorel saw only a decadent world of self-serving interest groups, self-indulgent intellectuals, and venal leaders rationalizing their lack of all conviction into pacifistic principles. The English were scorned for treating wars like athletic contests; the French, for succumbing to an arid rationalism easily co-opted by the Third Republic. He rejected the Enlightenment heritage traditionally honored by French revolutionaries, and the ‘illusions of progress’ that had led the French to worship the state, and workers to engage in demeaning political activity." — Billington, James H. (1980). ''Fire in the Minds of Men: Origins of Revolutionary Faith''. New York: Basic Books, p. 426. Also see Luigi Salvatorelli, "Spengler e Sorel", ''La Cultura'', Vol. XIV, No. 2, 1935, pp. 21-23; Pierre Angel, "Georges Sorel et la Décadence Européenne", ''L’Ordre'', 1937; Jean Wanner, ''Georges Sorel et la Décadence'', Librairie de Droit F. Roth. Lausanne, 1943; Pierre Cauvin, "La Notion de Décadence chez Oswald Spengler et Georges Sorel", Institut de Sociologie de Strasbourg, 1970; David Meakin, "Decadence and the Devaluation of Work: The Revolt of Sorel, Péguy and the German Expressionists," ''European History Quarterly'', Vol. I, No. 1, 1971; Paul Mazgaj, "The Young Sorelians and Decadence", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. XVII, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; yet whether this revival must occur by means of the middle and upper classes or of the proletariat is a point in question.

==Political writings==
"Sorel began his writing as a marginal [[Marxism|Marxist]], a critical analyst of Marx's economics and philosophy, and not a pious commentator. He then embraced revisionism, became for several years the 'metaphysician of [[syndicalism]]', as [[Jean Jaurès|Jaurès]] called him, flirted ardently with royalist circles, and then reverted to his commitment to the proletariat.  When the [[Bolsheviks]] came to power, he completed his cycle of illusions by saluting [[Vladimir Lenin]]&lt;ref&gt;Johannet, René (1921). [https://archive.org/stream/itinrairesdint00joha#page/226/mode/2up "Note sur la Vie et le Bolchevisme de Georges Sorel."] In: ''Itinéraires d'Intellectuels''. Paris, Nouvelle Librairie Nationale, pp. 227–232.&lt;/ref&gt; as the leader who had realized his syndicalist myth."&lt;ref&gt;Hale (1971), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The syndicalist or militant trade union movement, which burst into prominence in France around 1900, inspired Sorel to write his ''[[Reflections on Violence]]''. The turmoil engendered by strikes was universally condemned even by parliamentary socialists, who favored negotiation and conciliation. To justify the militancy and to give syndicalism an ideology, Sorel published the series of articles that became, as one of his biographers calls it, 'a famous and infamous book.'"&lt;ref&gt;Meisel, James H. (1951). [https://archive.is/20130802035630/http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b547;view=1up;seq=5 ''The Genesis of Georges Sorel'']. Ann Arbor, Michigan: The George Wahr Publishing Company, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it was Sorel's only successful book of about a dozen published,&lt;ref&gt;Hale (1971), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; which cemented his legacy by 1912 as "the leading figure amongst the French Syndicalists."&lt;ref&gt;James Ramsay McDonald, ''Syndicalism: A Critical Examination'', London, UK, Constable &amp; Co., 1912, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; This book was published in Italian, Spanish, German, Japanese and English.

Two of its themes have become a part of social science literature: the concept of the social myth and the virtue of violence.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} To Sorel the Syndicalist's general strike, the Marxist's catastrophic revolution, the Christian's church militant, the legends of the French Revolution, and the remembrance of [[June Days Uprising|June Days]] are all myths that move men, quite independent of their historical reality.  As one of Sorel's disciples ([[Benito Mussolini]])&lt;ref&gt;"Young Benito Mussolini became a Socialist and in 1908, at the age of 25, went to Trento as a journalist, and worked for a little with the Socialist irredentist leader, Cesare Battisti; he was soon expelled by the Austrian authorities and it is not uninteresting that the Florentine ''Voce'' published an article he then wrote on the Trentino. It is sometimes said that Mussolini's visit to Trento brought Nietzsche into his life, though he had certainly been influenced by him earlier; his journalistic efforts showed the influence, above all, of Georges Sorel, and his behaviour that of Sorel's friend, Pareto." — Wiskemann, Elizabeth (1947). [https://archive.org/stream/italy030855mbp#page/n61/mode/2up "The Origins of Fascism."] In: ''Italy''. Oxford University Press, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregor, A. James (1979). ''Young Mussolini and the Intellectual Origins of Fascism''. University of California Press {{ISBN|9780520037991}}&lt;/ref&gt; said, men do not move mountains; it is only necessary to create the illusion that mountains move. Social myths, says Sorel, are not descriptions of things, but "expressions of a determination to act."&lt;ref&gt;Hale (1971), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Myths enclose all the strongest inclinations of a people, of a party, or of a class, and the general strike is "the myth in which Socialism is wholly comprised."&lt;ref&gt;''Reflections on Violence'', Free Press, 1950, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; For Sorel the general strike was a catastrophic conception of socialism, the essence of the class struggle, and the only true Marxist means of effecting the revolution. Nowhere does Sorel endorse indiscriminate, brutal violence; only violence "enlightened by the idea of the general strike"&lt;ref&gt;''Reflections on Violence'', p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; is unconditionally defended. Only violence in the Marxist class war, as Sorel conceived it, is fine and heroic and in the service of the "immemorial interest of civilization."&lt;ref&gt;''Reflections on Violence'', p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Sorel makes no justification of violence by philosophical argument, but uses long excursions into history and current events to suggest that ethical codes are relative to their time and place.  Consistent with his position he could describe the Declaration of the Rights of Man as "only a colorless collection of abstract and confused formulas, without any practical bearing."&lt;ref&gt;''Reflections on Violence'', p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to Marxism==
Sorel had been politically [[monarchist]] and traditionalist before embracing [[orthodox Marxism]] in the 1890s. He attempted to fill in what he believed were gaps in Marxist theory, resulting in an extremely heterodox and idiosyncratic view of Marxism. For instance, Sorel saw [[pessimism]] and [[Irrationality|irrationalism]] at the core of Marxism and rejected [[Karl Marx]]'s own [[rationalism]] and "[[utopia]]n" tendency. Sorel also saw Marxism as closer in spirit to early [[Christianity]] than to the [[French Revolution]]. He did not view Marxism as "true" in a scientific sense, as orthodox Marxists did, but believed Marxism's "truth" lay in its promise of a morally redemptive role for the proletariat, within a terminally decadent society.

Sorel's was a [[Voluntarism (action)|voluntarist]] Marxism: he rejected those Marxists who believed in inevitable and evolutionary change, emphasizing instead the importance of [[Will (philosophy)|will]] and preferring [[direct action]]. These approaches included [[general strike]]s, [[boycott]]s, and constant disruption of [[capitalism]] with the goal being to achieve worker control over the means of production. Sorel's belief in the need for a deliberately conceived "myth" to sway crowds into concerted action was put into practice by mass fascist movements in the 1920s. The epistemic status of the idea of "myth" is of some importance, and is essentially that of a working hypothesis, with one fundamental peculiarity: it is an hypothesis which we do not judge by its closeness to a "Truth", but by the practical consequences which stem from it. Thus, whether a political myth is of some importance or not must be decided, in Sorel's view, on the basis of its capacity to mobilize human beings into political action;&lt;ref&gt;Marcu, Valeriu (1931). [https://archive.org/stream/menandforcesofou027065mbp#page/n237/mode/2up "Mythology of Dictatorship (Georges Sorel)."] In: ''Men and Fources of Our Time''. New York: The Viking Press, pp. 229–244.&lt;/ref&gt; the only possible way for men to ascend to an ethical life filled by the character of the sublime and to achieve deliverance. Sorel believed the "energizing myth"&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, David D. (2006). ''The Totalitarian Experiment in Twentieth-century Europe: Understanding the Poverty of Great Politics''. Taylor &amp; Francis, p. 113 {{ISBN|0415192781}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the general strike would serve to enforce [[Solidarity (sociology)|solidarity]], [[class consciousness]] and revolutionary élan among the [[working class]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Vernon (1912).

Sorel and the 'Syndicalist Myth' of the General Strike."] In: ''Vital Lies: Studies of Some Varieties of Recent Obscurantism'', Vol. 2, Chap. III. London, John Lane, The Bodley Head.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, William Yandell (1928). [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015002726241;view=1up;seq=133 "M. Georges Sorel and the 'Myth' of the General Strike."]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} In: ''The Pragmatic Revolt in Politics; Syndicalism, Fascism, and the Constitutional State''. New York: The Macmillan Company.&lt;/ref&gt; The "myth" that the [[fascists]] would appeal to, however, was that of the race, nation, or people, as represented by the [[Sovereign state|state]]. Historian [[Zeev Sternhell]] mentions frequently Sorel &lt;ref&gt;in Ni Droite, ni gauche (Neither Right nor Left), book originally published in 1983&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the men who led the way to the fusion of the left-wing revisionists and of the right-wing ultranationalists into what later became fascism. Sorel's vision of socialism was "a-Marxist, anti-Marxist, eventually [[Post-Marxism|post-Marxist]] [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ni droite ni gauche, l'idéologie fasciste en France, Zeev Sternhell, p. 196, French edition Folio Histoire 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Sternhell says that "the socialism designed as '[[Ethical socialism|ethical socialism]]' by Sorel, [[Robert Michels]] and [[Arturo Labriola]] [...] will play a huge role in the evolution of the socialist nationalist synthesis, in the eve of 1914 and in the [[Interwar period|Interwar]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ni droite ni gauche, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antisemitism==
[[Shlomo Sand]] and [[Zeev Sternhell]] agree that Sorel was [[antisemitic]]. Sternhell says in ''Neither Right nor Left: Fascist Ideology in France'' (''Ni droite ni gauche, l'idéologie fasciste en France'') that antisemitism was a cornerstone of Sorel's revolutionary syndicalism.&lt;ref&gt;In "Ni droite ni gauche, l'idéologie fasciste en France", p. 243, French edition, Folio Histoire, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Sand says that Sorel can be legitimately said to be antisemitic, as he proved his [[Judeophobia]] through his writings and public declarations.&lt;ref&gt;In "Sorel, les Juifs et l'antisémitisme", Cahiers Georges Sorel, 1984, see http://www.persee.fr/doc/mcm_0755-8287_1984_num_2_1_883&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-capitalism==
In his most famous work ''Reflections on Violence'' (1908), Sorel warned about the political trend that conservatives and parliamentary socialists could become allies in the struggle against capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;"There is only one thing which may indeed retard this rapid course toward the unknown, to the ‘mythic’ Social Revolution. This is readiness on the part of the ‘middle classes’ to yield and to make peace, combined with readiness to negotiate on the part of the ‘working class aristocracy,’ their acknowledged leaders. This is the only issue that Georges Sorel is particularly afraid of, as it is likely to soften the warlike spirit of the working class, and thus to postpone their victory in the struggle." — Miliukov, Paul (1920). [https://archive.org/stream/bolshevismintern00mili#page/n5/mode/2up ''Bolshevism: An International Danger'']. London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Sorel's view is that the conservatives and parliamentary socialism had common goals, both conceiving of the nation as a centrally controlled, organic unit.  Also, the parliamentarian socialism of the left wants economic nationalism, and huge tariff-barriers in order to protect their interior capitalists and this meshes with the cultural nationalism of the conservatives. Sorel warned about the creation of corporatism, where the workers movements and the employers organizations would merge, thus ending the class-struggle; because he felt that parliamentary democracy was moving in that direction at the beginning of the 19th century, Sorel said that the workers should stay away from the socialist parties, and use strikes and violence instead as their primary weapons against the middle and upper classes in parliament. That way, the workers would not only fight harder for their share of the values produced by capitalism, but also avoid the semi-feudal, corporative dystopia and oligarchy that the socialists and the conservatives were, supposedly, working towards.

==Thoughts on economics and parliamentary democracy==
In his ''Reflections on Violence'', Sorel says that parliamentary socialism, and its middle-class of bureaucrats and newspaper-intellectuals does not understand social science, economics, or any other matter important for good rule as well as the traditional liberal and capitalist elite that ruled before the mediocre middle-class became a powerful force in parliament. "How did these mediocre and silly people become so powerful?" Sorel asks.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} His theory on this is that the mediocre middle-class became powerful when the working-classes, people without property, were given the right to vote at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century. Thus, the working classes now created a problem for themselves by creating a political elite that is more stupid and less competent than the people who had a monopoly of power before them. He proposed that this problem could be fixed only by a collective withdrawal and boycott of the parliamentary system by the workers. Thus, the workers must return to strikes and violence as their main political tool, so Sorel says. This gives the workers a sense of unity, a return to dignity, and weakens the dangerous and mediocre middle-class in their struggle for power, and their attack on capitalism.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==Anti-elitism==
Sorel rejected political elitism&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Woodley, ''Fascism and Political Theory: Critical Perspectives on Fascist Ideology'', Routledge, 2010, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; because the middle-classes tend to co-opt all organizational hierarchies, and turn them into gentlemen's clubs for people who like to talk theory and write long newspaper articles. This point was made by Sorel in ''Reflections on Violence'', and was later developed further by [[Robert Michels]] and his [[Iron Law of Oligarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Michels, Robert (1915). [https://archive.org/stream/politicalparties00mich#page/376/mode/2up "Democracy and the Iron Law of Oligarchy."] In: ''Political Parties''. New York: Hearst's International Library Co., pp. 377–392.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sorel's antirealism==
[[Isaiah Berlin]] identifies three anti-scientific currents in Sorel's work,&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Sir Isaiah (1997). ''Against The Current: Essays in the History of Ideas''. London: Pimlico.&lt;/ref&gt; but Sorel's attack on science is neither general nor piecemeal.  Rather than "attacks", as is clear from the quotations below, Sorel explains how we should view "science" in relation to what he called "the real thing".

===Science is not reality===
{{also|Scientific anti-realism}}
He dismissed science as "a system of idealised entities: atoms, electric charges, mass, energy and the like – fictions compounded out of observed uniformities... deliberately adapted to mathematical treatment that enable men to identify some of the furniture of the universe, and to predict and... control parts of it." [1; 301] He regarded science more as "an achievement of the creative imagination, not an accurate reproduction of the structure of reality, not a map, still less a picture, of what there was. Outside of this set of formulas, of imaginary entities and mathematical relationships in terms of which the system was constructed, there was ‘natural’ nature – the real thing…" [1; 302] He regarded such a view as "an odious insult to human dignity, a mockery of the proper ends of men", [1; 300] and ultimately constructed by "fanatical pedants", [1; 303] out of "abstractions into which men escape to avoid facing the chaos of reality." [1; 302]

===Science is not nature===
As far as Sorel was concerned, "nature is not a perfect machine, nor an exquisite organism, nor a rational system." [1; 302] He rejected the view that "the methods of natural science can explain and explain away ideas and values…or explain human conduct in mechanistic or biological terms, as the…blinkered adherents of la petite science believe." [1; 310] He also maintained that the categories we impose upon the world, "alter what we call reality…they do not establish timeless truths as the positivists maintained", [1; 302] and to "confuse our own constructions with eternal laws or divine decrees is one of the most fatal delusions of men." [1; 303] It is "ideological patter... bureaucracy, la petite science... the Tree of Knowledge has killed the Tree of Life... human life [has been reduced] to rules that seem to be based on objective truths." [1; 303] Such to Sorel, is the appalling arrogance of science, a vast deceit of the imagination, a view that conspires to "stifle the sense of common humanity and destroy human dignity." [1; 304]

===Science is not a recipe===
Science, he maintained, "is not a ‘mill’ into which you can drop any problem facing you, and which yields solutions", [1; 311] that are automatically true and authentic. Yet, he claimed, this is precisely how too many people seem to regard it.

To Sorel, that is way "too much of a conceptual, ideological construction", [1; 312] smothering our perception of truth through the "stifling oppression of remorselessly tidy rational organisation." [1; 321] For Sorel, the inevitable "consequence of the modern scientific movement and the application of scientific categories and methods to the behaviour of men", [1; 323] is an outburst of interest in irrational forces, religions, social unrest, criminality and deviance &amp;ndash; resulting directly from an overzealous and monistic obsession with scientific rationalism.

And what science confers, "a moral grandeur, bureaucratic organisation of human lives in the light of…la petite science, positivist application of quasi-scientific rules to society – all this Sorel despised and hated", [1; 328] as so much self-delusion and nonsense that generates no good and nothing of lasting value.

[[Alexander Hamilton]] and his older brother James Hamilton Jr were born out of wedlock on the island of [[Nevis]] in the [[West Indies]].  His father, James A. Hamilton, was born in [[Ayrshire]], Scotland, and moved to the West Indies to become a merchant and set up his business on the island of [[Saint Kitts]]. The elder James Hamilton was the fourth son of [[Laird]] Alexander Hamilton of Grange

The lineage of the Hamiltons of Grange originated with Walter de Hamilton, founder of the Cambuskeith branch of [[Clan Hamilton]], who held lands in [[Edinburgh]] by a charter from [[Robert III of Scotland]] given between 1390 and 1406.&lt;ref name=churchbio/&gt;&lt;ref name=robertson/&gt;&lt;ref name=paterson/&gt; The last Laird of the Hamiltons of Grange, who held the title from 1774 until his death in 1837, was Alexander Hamilton's first cousin, also named Alexander.&lt;ref name=churchbio/&gt;&lt;ref name=allanbio/&gt;

In October 1772, Alexander Hamilton moved to the [[Thirteen Colonies]] (later the [[United States]]) to earn an education. He later became the first [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]]. He married [[Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton|Elizabeth Schuyler]], who was the daughter of [[Philip Schuyler]] and [[Van Rensselaer family|Catherine Van Rensselaer]], both members of prominent Dutch-American families, the [[Schuyler family|Schuyler]] and [[Van Rensselaer family|Van Rensselaer]] families.  Elizabeth and Alexander Hamilton were married on December 14, 1780, at the [[Schuyler Mansion]] in [[Albany, New York]].&lt;ref name=chernow/&gt; They went on to have eight children, thus establishing the Hamilton family in the United States.&lt;ref name="Reynolds1914"/&gt;

[[File:Medan. Aankomst van kolonel Julian, Bestanddeelnr 509-2-2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Hubert F. Julian in 1949.]]
'''Hubert Fauntleroy Julian''' (21 September 1897 – 19 February 1983) was a [[Trinidad]]-born [[aviation]] pioneer. He was nicknamed "[[List of military figures by nickname|The Black Eagle]]".

==Early years==
Hubert Fauntleroy Julian was born in [[Port of Spain]], Trinidad, in 1897. His father, Henry, was a cocoa plantation manager in Taco. Julian caught his first glimpse of an airplane on 3 January 1913, when [[Boland brothers|Frank Boland]] performed an exhibition flight, ultimately crashing and dying. The shock of the crash stayed with Julian who, after [[World War I]], left his island home for [[Canada]]. There, in November 1920, he flew for the first time during a joyride with Canadian flying ace [[Billy Bishop]]. Shortly after this he designed and patented what was labeled an "Aeroplane Safety Appliance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2014/oct/23/intrepid-black-eagle-hubert-julian/|title=The Intrepid 'Black Eagle,' Hubert Julian|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1920s==
In 1921, Julian left [[Montreal]] for good and moved to [[Harlem]]. Once there he came under the influence of the charismatic [[Marcus Garvey]] and joined the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League|Universal Negro Improvement Association]]. This new "Garveyvite" soon adopted a new persona, rechristening himself "Lieutenant Hubert Julian" of the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]. Julian had a tailor fashion for him a fake military uniform in order to push his new narrative. On 3 September 1922, Julian performed his first parachute jump at [[Curtiss Field]] on [[Long Island]]; the event was headlined with a flight by [[Bessie Coleman]]. Julian would make one more jump that year before teaming up with aviator [[Clarence Chamberlin]] who, in addition to teaching his new business partner how to truly handle an airplane, flew him up above Harlem where the Trinidadian parachuted several times, the most famous moment coming when he wore a crimson jumpsuit while playing "[[Runnin' Wild (1922 song)|Runnin' Wild]]" on a saxophone. This would be the stunt which caused [[H. Allen Smith]] to dub Julian, "The Black Eagle of Harlem".

In 1924, Julian, along with Chamberlin, began toying with the idea of performing a [[transatlantic flight]], with stops, from [[New York City]] to [[Liberia]]. An old [[seaplane]] was purchased and refitted for the proposed flight; Julian dubbed it the ''Ethiopia''. On 4 July, with a crowd of thousands gathered at the banks of the [[Harlem River]] to witness his takeoff, Julian boarded his plane, after having UNIA members help raise some last-minute funds to pay off his investors, and soared into the sky. A few minutes would pass before Julian realized that one of his plane's pontoons had filled up with water, throwing the aircraft's weight off balance. Unable to regain control, Julian crashed into [[Flushing Bay]].

Julian would try twice more to pilot a transatlantic flight before the 1920s came to end. The first of these two attempts ended when his plane's wings were vandalized by unknown assailants while they were being stored in [[Happyland Park]]. The second, and final, attempt saw New York State Senator [[A. Spencer Feld]] take the helm of the endeavor, but after [[Amelia Earhart]] crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean]], Julian felt dismayed at the prospect of performing something that had now been done by more than a handful of others and canceled the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/the-black-eagle-of-harlem-95208344/|title=The Black Eagle of Harlem|work=Air &amp; Space Magazine|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1930s==
During the first half of the 1930s, Julian made three trips to the [[Ethiopian Empire]]. It was during his second visit when he crashed [[Haile Selassie]]'s favorite plane, causing the emperor to ask Julian to leave his kingdom. But the Black Eagle would return on the eve of the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], gaining a military commission to help defend the African kingdom. It was during this third trip when he would come to blows with [[John Robinson (aviator)|John C. Robinson]], the Brown Condor of [[Chicago]], over jabs in the press which Julian attributed to Robinson. Once it became clear that the forces of [[Fascist Italy (1922-43)|Fascist Italy]] would prevail, Julian left the country, never to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/harlem-hubert-black-eagle-julian-soared-glory-ethiopia-article-1.803091|title=Harlem's Hubert (Black Eagle) Julian|work=New York Daily News|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian spent his time stateside traveling with William Powell's Five Blackbirds, an all African-American flying troupe who performed in the Midwest and California as well as performing piloting services for paying customers like [[Father Divine]]. He also embarked in a short-lived film producing career with the director [[Oscar Micheaux]], helping to fund the distribution for two of Micheaux's films: ''Lying Lips'' and ''The Notorious Eleanor Lee''.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==1940s==
During the [[Winter War]] between [[Finland]] and the [[Soviet Union]], Julian, along with many other American volunteers, left for Finland in order to help provide assistance. He was there for several months without seeing action, before departing back for the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://harlemworldmag.com/hubert-fauntleroy-julian-the-black-eagle-of-harlem/|title=Hubert Fauntleroy Julian "The Black Eagle of Harlem"|last=|first=|date=|work=Harlem World Mag|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Julian learned, from [[Giuseppe Mario Bellanca|Giuseppe Bellanca]], what [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Hermann Göring|Hermann Goring]] had been saying about peoples of color, the Black Eagle issued a challenge to the latter, offering the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] leader the chance to duel him in an aerial battle above the [[English Channel]]. Goring never gave an official response to the challenge, but Julian gained widespread praise for his bold verbal attacks.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Once the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] thrust the United States into [[World War II]], Julian, now in his 40s, enlisted into the military. He would serve less than a year, becoming an American citizen in the process, and earning an honorable discharge with the final rank of private first class.

==1950s and 1960s==
After the end of World War II Julian become a licensed arms dealer. His first contract was with the [[Jacobo Árbenz|Arbenz]] government of [[Guatemala]]. He defied the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] when, after being asked to cease his dealings, Julian continued selling. His second contract was with the [[Fulgencio Batista|Bautista]] government of [[Cuba]] as it tried, and ultimately failed, to combat [[Fidel Castro]]'s revolutionaries. His third, and final, contract was with [[Moïse Tshombe|Moise Tshombe]], leader of [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] during the Congo Secession Crisis of the early 1960s. Julian was detained by [[United Nations]] forces for questioning and was in the end jailed for four months before being released. He retired upon his return to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/06/archives/black-eagle-of-harlem-77-looks-back-on-days-as-flier-and-soldier-of.html|title=The Black Eagle Reflects|last=|first=|date=|work=New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years and death==
Julian spent his retirement meeting the likes of [[Muhammad Ali]] and appearing on ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. He died in 1983 and was buried at [[Calverton National Cemetery]] in [[Suffolk County, New York]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Personal life==
Hubert Julian was married three times. His first marriage, which lasted only a few years, was to Edna Powell. His second marriage, his longest, was to Essie Gittens, who he had known while growing up in Trinidad. They raised a young orphaned cousin of Essie's, a girl named Olga, as their own. His third marriage, after Essie died, was to a woman named Doreen, who gave birth to Julian's only biological child, Mark Anthony Bernard Julian, in July 1971.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Documentary==
''[[imdbtitle:4343770|The Black Eagle of Harlem]]'' is a documentary by independent filmmaker Billy Tooma. It covers Julian's life from his birth in Trinidad to his adventures in Harlem, Ethiopia, and everywhere between. It saw its world premiere on 24 June 2017, at the [[Aviation Hall of Fame &amp; Museum of New Jersey]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''James Baillie''' (1737 – 7 September 1793) was a British West Indies plantation owner and merchant, and a Member of the Great British Parliament from 1792 to 1793.&lt;ref name=UCL&gt;{{cite web|title=James Baillie MP of Bedford Square and Ealing Grove|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/2146633538|website=Legacies of British Slave-ownership|publisher=UCL Department of History|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spanglefish.com/slavesandhighlanders/index.asp?pageid=408235|title=Slaves and Highlanders - James Baillie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Baillie,  a descendant of [[William Wallace]]&lt;ref&gt;Sir William Baillie of Hoprig, 2nd Laird of Hoprig (1293–1357), married Wallace's only child Elizabeth of Lamington&lt;/ref&gt; and an ancestral nephew of [[John I de Balliol]], was the second son of Hugh Baillie, of Dochfour, south of Inverness, by his wife (married 1730) Emilia, daughter of Alexander Fraser, 11th of Relig, Reelig or Rulick, Kirkhill, Inverness, by Catharine daughter of William Mackenzie of Sildoc. Hugh Baillie was son of Alexander Baillie by (married 1709) Hannah Fraser, of Relig. Alexander Baillie was son of David Baillie, 1st Laird of Dochfour, and second son of Alexander, 7th Laird of Dunain, from whom he inherited Dochfour, Easter and Wester Dochain in 1657, married secondly Margaret daughter of Hugh Fraser, 8th [[Lord Lovat]].&lt;ref name=Bulloch&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bulloch|first1=Joseph Gaston Baillie|title=A history and genealogy of the family of Baillie of Dunain, Dochfour and Lamington : with a short sketch of the family of McIntosh, Bulloch, and other families|date=1898|publisher=The Gazette Print|location=Green Bay, Wis.|url=https://archive.org/details/historygenealogy01bull|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Baillie's younger brother was [[Evan Baillie]], of Dochfour, of Parliament, the West Indies and Bristol.&lt;ref name=Bulloch /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evan Baillie|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/128429844|website=Legacies of British Slave-ownership|publisher=UCL Department of History|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baillie arrived in St. Christopher's ([[Saint Kitts]]) in 1755, and soon bought the Hermitage plantation in [[Grenada]], undertook around 20 years of work, and in 1775 (?) returned to Great Britain and London. In 1772 James Baillie wrote: "[through] 1755–71 I was employed in the line of planting and commerce in the islands of St Christopher and Grenada [and [[Demerara|Demerary]]]... and [in 1772] our house sold Negroes here to the amount of £120,000 sterling..."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1790–1820'', ed. R. Thorne, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the 1833 compensation claims Baillie's heirs were awarded c. £73,700 compensation for their c. 1,821 slaves in Grenada, Guyana and St. Lucia.&lt;ref name=UCL /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some of the Northbrook Plantation sale particulars, June 1794, from ESSEQUEBO EN DEMERARISCHE COURANT (No. 31. ), ZONDAG Den 1 Juny 1794: ''By Order of the Trustees of James Baillie, Esq. deceased. To be Sold at Public Auction, at Mr. Stroud's Tavern, St. George's, Grenada, on Tuesday the first of July next, between the hours of Ten and Twelve in the Forenoon. That valuable Cotton Plantation on the East Sea Coast of Demerary, Called NORTH BROOK, Consisting of 500 Acres of Land, whereof 250 are planted with Prime Cotton Trees, 66 Acres in Plantains, and 28 Acres more empouldered, together with 147 Negroes, amongst which are several valuable Tradesmen: the whole forming a complete Gang, fully equal to the Cultivation of the whole of the Land, without any additional Strength. The Buildings are built of the very best Materials, mostly Country Wood, and in complete Repair. The Fertility of the Soil, and the Healthiness of the Situation are well known, and may be ascertained by Enquiry of Gentlemen acquainted with that Colony."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vc.id.au/edg/17940601edc.html|title=Essequebo en Demerarische Courant 1794 June 01|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was M.P. for [[Horsham]], in Sussex, from 1792 for only 18 months. There he had seemed to have been beaten at the poll, and so before a petition gave him the seat, he had been appointed British agent to Grenada. One is not sure whether he took up that post or where he died.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

But as Member for Horsham Baillie it is known that he spoke well in favour of the planters (plantation owners) in the slavery debate of 2 April 1792, against [[William Wilberforce|Wilberforce's]] "wild, impracticable, and visionary scheme" of abolition, adding that there was "more wretchedness and poverty in the parish of [[St Giles in the Fields|St. Giles']] than in the whole of the British colonies".&lt;ref&gt;Senator, iv, 512, from ''The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1790–1820'', ed. R. Thorne, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; He had his speech published.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In London Baillie lived in [[Bedford Square]] and [[Ealing Grove]], the nine bays and three-storeyed pedimented central projection [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] palace set in 64 acres, re-modeled for [[Joseph Gulston (collector)|Joseph Gulston]], the younger, the collector and MP. Ealing Grove had then been owned by [[George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough|4th Duke of Marlborough]] (1775) and [[John Campbell, 5th Duke of Argyll|5th Duke of Argyll]] before Baillie bought it in 1791. The [[Edward Harley, 5th Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|5th Earl of Oxford]] was the tenant between 1799–1802, and Baillie's heirs sold it in 1811, having had passed a Private Act of Parliament in 1805. By 1800 James Baillie's widow, Mrs. Baillie (Colina), was living at 12 Harley Street, Cavendish Square.

He married, Grenada, 26 April 1772, Colina or Colin Campbell (1753-) one of the two surviving daughters, co-heiresses, of Colin Roy Campbell, of Glenure (c1708-1752), son of Patrick or John Campbell, 3rd or 4th of [[Barcaldine, Argyll]] (1677–1738), by Lucia or Lucy Cameron (1692-) of Loch Eil (Cameron of Locheil), Lochaber, Inverness-shire, daughter of Sir [[Ewen Cameron of Lochiel]], 17th Chief of Clan Cameron (1629–1719), who [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]] termed the "Ulysses of the Highlands".

Eight months before Colina's birth, on 14 May 1752, her father, Colin "Redfox" Campbell, was assassinated at [[Ballachulish]], Lettermore, Argyll, by a member of the Stewart family.  This the infamous [[Appin murder]] was the base of R. L. Stevenson's [[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]. Campbell was Hanoverian factor, or rent collector, for the forfeited estates of Stewart of Ardsheil in Argyllshire, Cameron of Callart, Mamore, and part of that of Cameron of Lochiel. Colina's mother was Janet Mackay (married 1749), daughter of Lt. Col. Hon. Hugh Mackay (son of 3rd [[Lord Reay]]) (married 1728) by Elizabeth Mackay, 6th of Bighouse, daughter of George Mackay of Bighouse, Strath Halladale, by [[Melvich]], Sutherland.

Colina's elder sister was Louisa Campbell, 8th or Portioner of Bighouse (1751–1835), painted by [[Henry Raeburn]], who had married George Mackay of Handa (1736-) in 1768, and had: Janet Mackay (c 1768-15.3.1857). The present day Bighouse Lodge was built in 1765.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bighouseestate.co.uk/page4.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=16 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627072718/http://bighouseestate.co.uk/page4.html# |archive-date=27 June 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monumental portrait==
The world of Baillie was captured by [[Thomas Gainsborough]] in a large (100 x 90 inches) portrait that had been intended for the RA show of 1784. It was bequeathed to the National Gallery by his son, a school-friend of [[Lord Byron]], "Long Baillie", Alexander Baillie (1777–1855) in 1855, with provision for it to first be lent to his nephew [[Matthew James Higgins]] (1810–1868), aka Jacob Omnium; thus it passed to the national collection (now Tate Britain) in 1868.

Alexander Baillie, drawn by Ingres in 1816, was a close friend of [[Jørgen von Cappelen Knudtzon]] (1784–1854), the Norwegian. Bust portraits of both von Cappelen and Baillie were carved by [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]. Alexander Baillie was buried in the Protestant cemetery in Naples in the same grave as writer and kinswoman Harriet Charlotte Beaujolais Campbell (died Naples 2.1848, aged 46), aka Viscountess Tullamore and Countess of Charleville, who had married (Florence, 1821) [[Charles Bury, 2nd Earl of Charleville]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander Baillie|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/2146630871|website=Legacies of British Slave-ownership|publisher=UCL Department of History|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Francois "Dominique" Joseph Loridan, Valet de Chambre to M. Alexander Baillie of Naples, Tuscany (23 April 1780 – 16 April 1853).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://website.lineone.net/~stephaniebidmead/protnaplees.htm|title=protnaplees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In  November 2008 ''Highland News'' (13 November 2008) reported that local MSP [[David Stewart (Scottish politician)|David Stewart]] had raised the issue of [[Inverness Museum and Art Gallery]]'s loan request of the Baillie family by Gainsborough at the Scottish Parliament's Question Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://davidstewart.wordpress.com/2008/11/07/parliamentary-support-for-historic-gainsborough/|title=Parliamentary Support for Historic Gainsborough|date=7 November 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was supported by the then tourism minister [[Jim Mather]], as well as [[Highland Council]] convener Sandy Park, Inverness Provost Jimmy Gray and Highland councillor and historian David Alston. Stewart said:&lt;ref&gt;conflating his 15 October 2008 press release and the ''Highland News'' report&lt;/ref&gt; "The painting is controversial because the Baillie family were involved in the slave trade. Following the emancipation of slaves in 1834 they received the equivalent of 5.5 million, which they reinvested in their estates in the Highlands and Islands... and was used to develop the Highlands through establishments like Inverness Royal Academy and the Royal Northern Infirmary. This was the only Highlander that to my knowledge was painted by Gainsborough. However, history should be seen warts and all, it's important that people know what it is. The Baillies played a big part in the development of the Highlands. It's a bit like the [[Highland Clearances]], they are an appalling part of Highland history but people should know about it. Schools could make the painting a research project. If we got the painting on loan this would provide a huge boost to tourism in the Highlands and Islands and attract inward investment. It would be like when [[Caley Thistle]] signed [[Marius Niculae]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highland-news.co.uk/News/Portrait-too-big-for-city-gallery-4670.htm|title=Portrait too big for city gallery!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miss Colin-Campbell Baillie (1782–1830)===
[[File:J. St. John Long (a dubious medical practitioner) dressed as Wellcome V0016227.jpg|thumbnail|Coloured etching by Sharpshooter,&lt;ref&gt;pseudonym, possibly of J. Phillips&lt;/ref&gt; 8 September 1830, lampooning the manslaughtering quack doctor [[John St. John Long]] ]]
The baby daughter shown in the Gainsborough portrait was Miss Colin-Campbell Baillie (1782–1830), who married (Marylebone, 8 August 1816), [[s:A Naval Biographical Dictionary/Lloyd, Edward|Admiral Edward Lloyd, RN, KH]] ([[Royal Guelphic Order]]). Mrs Lloyd died infamously aged 48 having fallen victim to the dangerous quack [[John St. John Long]] (1798–1834). Long was a good painter (nb. his ''The Temptation in the Wilderness'', 1824, in Tate Britain), having been one of the only two known pupils of painter [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]]; however by 1827 he had realised that turpentine served him better as a massage oil for the ladies than mixed with oily pigments and placed on canvas. Exposed as a quack by 1828 he was charged and possibly convicted of Colin-Campbell Lloyd's manslaughter "on the grounds of gross ignorance, and on other considerations", but he escaped prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60737-6 |pmid=24800298 |title=John St John Long: Quackery and manslaughter |journal=The Lancet |volume=383 |issue=9928 |pages=1540–1 |year=2014 |last1=Hempel |first1=Sandra |quote=Mrs Lloyd consulted him [Long] in October 1830 over a sporadic cough. Five days after she started treatment she began complaining of a violent burning sensation in the sore on her chest, as well as shivering, thirst, and nausea. Her husband described the wound as 'discharging a dirty, white-ish, thick kind of substance'. The inflammation then began to spread down her arms. Long said this was all perfectly normal. He advised her to drink brandy and water and to put her head under the bedclothes. Two days later the doctors were called in, including Benjamin, later [[Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 1st Baronet|Sir Benjamin, Brodie]], surgeon to King William IV, but to no avail. Mrs Lloyd died three weeks later, a month after she had first put herself under the care of Long. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A claimant on her behalf, a trustee of her marriage settlement, "for compensation for the enslaved people on [[Bacolet, Grenada|Baillie's Bacolet]] in Grenada", was Commander Sir George Young, 2nd Bt., RN, ancestor of the present (2014) UK Government Chief Whip [[Sir George Young, 6th Baronet]], PC, OM.

[[File:JimMugshot.jpg|thumb|A wounded Jim Younger after his arrest in 1876]]
'''James Hardin Younger''' (January 15, 1848 – October 19, 1902) was a notable American [[outlaw]] and member of the [[James–Younger Gang]]. He was the brother of [[Cole Younger|Cole]], [[John Younger|John]] and [[Bob Younger]]

==Life==
Born in [[Missouri]] on January 15, 1848. Jim Younger was the ninth of fourteen children born to [[Henry Washington Younger]] and [[Bersheba Leighton Fristoe]]. With his brother Cole, he joined the Confederate Army during the [[American Civil War]], eventually becoming a member of [[Quantrill's Raiders]] in 1864. Jim was later captured by Union troops, in the same ambush that resulted in [[William Quantrill]]'s death, and was imprisoned until the war's end. 

After the war Jim tried his hand at various activities, including starting a horse ranch.  In 1873 he joined the James–Younger Gang, which was founded by Cole, along with [[Frank James|Frank]] and [[Jesse James]].

It's uncertain how much time he spent with the gang, but he was present when his brother John was killed by [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkertons]] in [[Roscoe, Missouri]] in 1874.  He left the gang and spent the next two years working a ranch in San Luis Obispo, California.

==Return to James–Younger Gang and death==
Jim returned to the gang in time to join the ill-fated 1876 bank job in [[Northfield, Minnesota]].  Part of his jaw was shot off and he was captured and sentenced to life imprisonment. Along with Cole, he was paroled in 1901. After his release he became engaged to Alix Mueller, who had met him in prison 20 years after the Northfield robbery. Due to the terms of his parole, however, Jim couldn't marry. He committed suicide on October 19, 1902.  His body was returned to [[Lee's Summit, Missouri]] for burial.

==Film and television depiction==
In 1941, Younger was portrayed by actor [[Arthur Kennedy]] in the film ''[[Bad Men of Missouri]]''.

In 1950, [[Dewey Martin (actor)|Dewey Martin]] played Younger in the film ''[[ Kansas Raiders]]'', about his time spent with [[Quantrill's Raiders]].

In 1954, [[Sheb Wooley]] played Younger in an episode of [[Jim Davis (actor)|Jim Davis]]'s [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[Western (genre)|western]] [[television series]], ''[[Stories of the Century]]''.

In the 1972 film ''[[The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid]]'' he was portrayed by [[Luke Askew]]''.

In the 1980 film ''[[The Long Riders]]'' he was portrayed by [[Keith Carradine]].

In the TV show ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]'', he was portrayed in the episode "[[Baby Outlaws S3E21]]" by [[Donnie Jeffcoat]]

In the 2001 film ''[[American Outlaws]]'' he was portrayed by [[Gregory Smith (actor)|Gregory Smith]].

'''James Millar''' (born 20 November 1934 in [[Edinburgh]]) is a retired [[Association football|footballer]] who played for [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]], [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]], mainly as a [[Forward (association football)|centre forward]].

==Playing career==
===Club===
Born in [[Edinburgh]], Millar was signed by Rangers manager [[Scot Symon]] for £5000 on 12 January 1955 from Dunfermline Athletic,&lt;ref name=gers/&gt;&lt;ref name=family/&gt; where he had played as a [[Midfielder|half back]] and also played in that position on a number of occasions in the early seasons of his career at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]]. Millar achieved more success when he played at centre forward in a pre-season tour of America and started scoring goals regularly.&lt;ref name=gers/&gt;&lt;ref name=family/&gt; Millar was an integral part of the Rangers team of the early 1960s, alongside players such as [[Bobby Shearer]], [[Eric Caldow]], [[Davie Wilson]], [[John Greig]], [[Jim Baxter]] and [[Alex Scott (footballer born 1937)|Alex Scott]]. Millar had a highly successful strike partnership with fellow Edinburgh native [[Ralph Brand]] during this time. Despite not being particularly tall, he was renowned for his heading ability and bravery.&lt;ref name=gers/&gt;&lt;ref name=family/&gt;

Millar's total of 30 goals in the [[Scottish Cup]] is a post-war record for Rangers, equalled only by [[Derek Johnstone]],&lt;ref name=family/&gt; and on two occasions he scored twice in Scottish Cup finals, in [[Scottish Cup 1959-60|1960]]&lt;ref name=gers/&gt; and [[Scottish Cup 1963-64|1964]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rangers.co.uk/news/features/classic-match-dundee-1964/|title=Classic matches: Rangers 3–1 Dundee, April 1964|publisher=Rangers F.C.|date=|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; another record equalled only by Johnstone. Millar was the first ever [[substitute (football)|substitute]] to come on for Rangers, replacing [[Jim Forrest (footballer born 1944)|Jim Forrest]] during a 5–0 victory over [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] in a league match at Ibrox in October 1966.

Millar was also known for his scoring record against Rangers' arch-rivals [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], with 13 goals in [[Old Firm]] matches, including two winning goals at [[Celtic Park]] in the traditional New Year's Day fixture, in 1960 and 1964. Millar made 317 appearances (197 in the league) for Rangers, scoring 162 goals (91 in the league) and also won three Championships, five [[Scottish Cup]]s and three [[Scottish League Cup]]s.&lt;ref name=gers/&gt;&lt;ref name=FSRFC/&gt;&lt;ref name=family/&gt;

In the summer of 1967, Millar left Rangers for [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] and became manager of [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]] for a brief spell after retiring, before owning a hostelry in [[Leith]].&lt;ref name=family/&gt;

'''John Eric Austin''' (born 21 August 1944), formerly '''Austin-Walker''', is a [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Woolwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Woolwich]] from [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992]] to [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]] and for [[Erith and Thamesmead (UK Parliament constituency)|Erith and Thamesmead]] from [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]] to [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010]].

==Early life==
He attended the Glyn Grammar School for Boys (now called [[Glyn School]]) on The Kingsway in [[Epsom]]. Austin gained a Certificate in Community and Youth Work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldsmiths.ac.uk/pace/community-work.php |title=Community &amp; Youth Work, Goldsmiths, University of London |publisher=Goldsmiths.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=12 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617103416/http://www.goldsmiths.ac.uk/pace/community-work.php |archivedate=17 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmith's College]] in 1972 and a Master of Arts in Policy Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/sps/ |title=Bristol University &amp;#124; School for Policy Studies |publisher=Bristol.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[University of Bristol]] in 1990. He worked as a medical laboratory technician from 1961–3, a Labour Party [[organiser (party)|organiser]] from 1963–70, a social worker in Bexley from 1972–4 before becoming Director of Bexley Council&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bexleycre.org.uk {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206084200/http://www.bexleycre.org.uk/ |date=6 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for Racial Equality until 1992.

Austin became a [[councillor]] for the [[Royal Borough of Greenwich|London Borough of Greenwich]] in 1970, and was leader of the council from 1982 to 1987, when he became mayor for two years. He stepped down as a councillor in 1994.

==Parliamentary career==
Austin stood for the seat of [[Woolwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Woolwich]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]], and won it from independent [[John Cartwright (British politician)|John Cartwright]] with a majority of 2,225.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge92/i22.htm |title=University of Keele – Political Science Resources – UK General Election results April 1992 |publisher=Psr.keele.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[constituency]] boundaries for the area were re-drawn for [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], and Austin won the new seat of Erith and Thamesmead with a majority of 17,424.

Austin served as a member of the [[Health Select Committee]] from 1994 until 2005. He served on the Parliamentary [[Joint Committee on Human Rights]].

In May 2005 Austin threatened to stand as a [[stalking horse]] candidate against [[Tony Blair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/stalkinghorse-threat-to-oust-blair-490152.html |work=The Independent |title='Stalking-horse' threat to oust Blair|date=10 May 2005 |accessdate = 8 March 2010|location=London | first=Andrew | last=Grice}}&lt;/ref&gt; He intended to trigger a leadership election at the [[Labour Party Conference|party conference]] in September 2005 if Blair himself did not do so by resigning as leader. He indicated his hope that, in the event of a contest, [[Gordon Brown]] would enter and win. However he was unable to accumulate the number of required nominations from fellow [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] to force a contest.

Austin, a member of the left-wing [[Socialist Campaign Group]], announced his retirement in July 2008. He told a meeting of the General Council of the Erith &amp; Thamesmead Constituency Labour Party that he would not run again at the next general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=John Austin MP to retire|url=http://www.epolitix.com/mpwebsites/mppressreleases/mppressreleasedetails/newsarticle/john-austin-mp-to-retire///mpsite/10763/?no_cache=1|work=ePolitix|date=31 July 2008|accessdate=2 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austin was implicated in the 2009 [[MPs' expenses scandal]], he claimed a total of £133,000 in second home allowances since 2001, despite the fact the two London flats he lived in over the period were just over 10 miles away from his main residence in Kent.&lt;ref name="BBC whips"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8056591.stm|title= Party whips face expenses focus|work=BBC News|accessdate=19 May 2009|date=19 May 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Austin has said his claims had been reasonable and within the rules.&lt;ref name="BBC whips"/&gt;

He is also a patron of [[Humanists UK]] (formerly known as the British Humanist Association).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanism.org.uk/about/people/distinguished-supporters |title=Distinguished Supporters |publisher=www.humanism.org.uk |accessdate=4 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Austin lists his interests as running, cookery, and gardening. He married Linda in 1965. They have two sons Damien and Toby and a daughter Zoe, and divorced in 1988. Zoe gave him three grandchildren, Felix, Matilda and Kitty. Toby has given him three grandsons, Jake, Cameron and Ziggy. Damien has two sons.

On 15 September 2010, Austin, along with 54 other public figures, signed an open letter published in ''[[The Guardian]]'', stating their opposition to [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s state visit to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/15/harsh-judgments-on-pope-religion|title=Letters: Harsh judgments on the pope and religion|work=The Guardian|accessdate=16 September 2010 | location=London | date=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:5 Cheyne Walk 01.JPG|thumb|[[5 Cheyne Walk]]]]

'''John Camden Neild''' (1780–1852) was an English [[miser]].

==Life==
Neild, son of [[James Neild]], prison reformer, was probably born in St. James's Street, London, about 1780. He was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] from 1793 to 1797, then at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], graduating in 1801, and being awarded his honorary M.A. three years later, as is standard at Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=NLT796JC|name=Neild, John Camden}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 Feb. 1808 he was called to the bar at [[Lincoln's Inn]]. 

Succeeding in 1814 to the whole of his father's property, estimated at £250,000, he developed into a confirmed miser, and the last thirty years of his life were solely employed in accumulating wealth. He lived in a large house, [[5 Cheyne Walk]], Chelsea, but it was so meanly furnished that for some time he had not a bed to lie on. His dress consisted of a blue swallow-tailed coat with gilt buttons, brown trousers, short gaiters, and shoes which were patched and generally down at the heels. He never allowed his clothes to be brushed, because, he said, it destroyed the nap. He continually visited his numerous estates, walking whenever it was possible, never went to the expense of a great-coat, and always stayed with his tenants, sharing their coarse meals and lodging. While at [[North Marston]], in Buckinghamshire, about 1828 he attempted to cut his throat, and his life was only saved by the prompt attention of his tenant's wife, Mrs. Neale. Unlike other eminent misers – Daniel Dancer or [[John Elwes (politician)|John Elwes]] – he occasionally indulged in acts of benevolence, possessed considerable knowledge of legal and general literature, and to the last retained a love for the classics.

He died at 5 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, 30 Aug. 1852, aged 72, and was buried in the chancel of North Marston Church on 9 Sept. By his will, after bequeathing a few trifling legacies, he left the whole of his property, estimated at £500,000, to ‘[[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria]], begging Her Majesty's most gracious acceptance of the same for her sole use and benefit.’ Two caveats were entered against the will, but were subsequently withdrawn. Queen Victoria increased Neild's bequests to the three executors from £100 to £1,000 each, she provided for his servants, for whom he made no provision, and she secured an annuity of £100 to Mrs. Neale, who had frustrated Neild's attempt at suicide. In 1855 Queen Victoria restored the chancel of North Marston Church and inserted a window to Neild's memory.

'''Joseph Fahys''' (May 28, 1832 – December 11, 1915) was one of the first U.S. [[watch#Parts|watch case]] manufacturers.  After emigrating from France, he went on to establish  [[Joseph Fahys &amp; Co.]], which at one time was the largest manufacturer of watch cases and one of the largest manufacturers of [[Silver (household)|silverware]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="Leonard1922"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=John William|title=Who's who in finance and banking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r-8ZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA150|accessdate=31 October 2011|edition=Public domain|year=1922|publisher=Who's Who in Finance Inc.|pages=150–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the founder and first president of the [[Jewelers' Board of Trade]], and the first president of the Watchcase Manufacturers' Association.

==Early years==
Fahys was born on May 28, 1832 in [[Belfort]], France. He was the son of Joseph and Marianne Moulleseaux Fahys.&lt;ref name="Collectors2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors|title=NAWCC bulletin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nkIeAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=31 October 2011|year=2001|publisher=National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a contractor; and both his father and brother died when Fahys was young. In company with his mother, he came to New York in March, 1848. He apprenticed himself to Ulysses Savoye (or Ulyses S. Savage), of [[West Hoboken, New Jersey]], one of the two first makers of watch cases in the United States. He remained in Savoye's employ for five years, and soon after attaining his majority, began what an independent career.&lt;ref name="HowardJervis1893"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howard|first1=Henry Ward Beecher|last2=Jervis|first2=Arthur N.|title=The Eagle and Brooklyn|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SUsMAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1017|accessdate=31 October 2011|edition=Public domain|year=1893|publisher=The Brooklyn daily eagle|pages=1017–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Fahys bought out the Savoye business on June 1, 1857. He continued it under his own name and moved the factory to the fourth floor of 75 [[Nassau Street (Manhattan)|Nassau Street]], New York City before later moving the plant to [[Carlstadt, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="The Jewelers' circular"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Jewelers' circular|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tFUcAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA183|accessdate=31 October 2011|edition=Public domain|date=April 30, 1919|publisher=Jewelers' Circular Co.|pages=183–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1861, he formed a connection with [[Fortenbach Brothers]] (John, Jacob, and Joseph),&lt;ref name="ClaytonNelson1882"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clayton|first1=W. Woodford|last2=Nelson|first2=William|title=History of Bergen and Passaic counties, New Jersey: with biographical sketches of many of its pioneers and prominent men|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zDEUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA228|accessdate=31 October 2011|edition=Public domain|year=1882|publisher=Everts &amp; Peck|pages=228–}}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in the building at Carlstadt, one of the first establishments in America which manufactured watch cases on an extensive scale; for five years, business was profitable. In 1867, Fahys located a similar factory in Brooklyn in which he associated with Wheeler, Parsons &amp; Hayes, and the joint enterprise was known as the Brooklyn Watch Case Company. When both factories were well under way, Fahys sold his New York store to Ward &amp; Jennings, two of his employees, and gave his undivided attention to his manufacturing interests. In 1876, he bought the share of the Fortenbach Brothers and moved the Carlstadt plant to Sag Harbor, Long Island.&lt;ref name="HowardJervis1893" /&gt; For many years he made a specialty of silver watch cases.&lt;ref name="The Jewelers' circular" /&gt;

He was president of [[Joseph Fahys &amp; Co.]], located in the Fahys Building, on 54 [[Maiden Lane (Manhattan)|Maiden Lane]], [[New York City]]; the company was established in 1857.&lt;ref name="Jewelers1897"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jewelers' Circular|title=The jewelers' circular and horological review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RHUoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA28|accessdate=31 October 2011|edition=Public domain|volume=XXXIV; No. 14|date=May 5, 1897|publisher=Jewelers' Circular Pub.

W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-393-03856-9|pages=187–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Francis Cook, who was president of the [[Montauk Steamboat Company]], became a partner of Fays &amp; Co. in 1880. In 1887, in connection with A. N. Darling, Hayden W. Wheeler, Lewis A. Parsons and Henry Hays, he founded the Brooklyn Watch Case Co. for the manufacture of solid gold cases and retained a dominant interest in this for many years though he devoted his time principally to his own factory at Sag Harbor.&lt;ref name="The Jewelers' circular" /&gt;

Fahys was the founder and first president of the Jewelers' Board of Trade, and the first president of the Watchcase Manufacturers' Association. He was a member of the [[Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York]], the [[Union League]], and the Downtown Association. He was a trustee of the Homoeopathic Hospital, the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church,&lt;ref name="HowardJervis1893" /&gt; and the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences. He was director of the Alvin Manufacturing Co., Brooklyn Watch Case Co., Sea View Elevated Railroad Co., and Victoria Fire Insurance Co.&lt;ref name="Biographical1900"&gt;{{cite book|author=Biographical directory Co.|title=Biographical directory of the state of New York, 1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hns_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA130|accessdate=31 October 2011|edition=Public domain|year=1900|publisher=Biographical directory company (incorporated)|pages=130–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1856, he married a lady who was a native of Sag Harbor.  Their son, George Ernest Fahys, who became a partner in the Fahys Co., was born in West Hoboken in 1864. Fahys's daughter, Lena Marianne, married Cook in 1883.&lt;ref name="HowardJervis1893" /&gt; 

Fahys and Cook purchased one thousand acres of land in [[North Haven, New York|North Haven]], a suburb of Sag Harbor, with two miles of frontage on [[Peconic Bay]].&lt;ref name="Ross1903"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Peter|title=A history of Long Island: from its earliest settlement to the present time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6T_ubA4oBXgC&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=31 October 2011|edition=Public domain|year=1903|publisher=The Lewis publishing company|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fahys' [[Clinton Hill, Brooklyn]] residences were designed in 1889 and 1890 by [[Benjamin Wistar Morris, III]].

She had her own reality television shows ''[[Kimora: Life in the Fab Lane]]'' (2007&amp;ndash;2011) and ''Kimora: House of Fab'' (2013).

==Early life and education==
Kimora Lee Perkins was born in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].&lt;ref name="People20060331"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebookstandard.com/bookstandard/reviews/books_in_news_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001882919 'Fabulosity,' by Kimora Lee Simmons] (review January 22, 2006) ''TheBookStandard.com''.

Kimora's father is African American. Her father, Vernon Whitlock Jr., worked as a Federal Marshal, an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigator, a [[bail bondsman]], and later became a [[barber]] in St. Louis.&lt;ref name=eaton&gt;Phoebe Eaton (June 14, 2004) [http://nymag.com/nymetro/shopping/fashion/features/9306/index2.html Kimora Lee Simmons, the New Queen of Conspicuous Consumption] ''New York Magazine''.

It was substantiated in the U.S. District Court (Honorable Clyde Cahill) that government agents attempted to recruit Whitlock as an informant in exchange for probation, but he vehemently refused. Consequently, he was refused probation and was taken off his $500,000 bond and was given the 24-year sentence; he was released after five years. Her parents split up and she was raised by her mother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celebritybabyscoop.com/2009/08/20/kimora-lee-simmons-my-kids-make-my-world-go-round "Kimora Lee Simmons: “My Kids Make My World Go ‘Round”"]. August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Growing up in the northern St. Louis suburb of [[Florissant, Missouri]], Kimora was the target of schoolyard bullying and teasing, because of her height (she was {{height|ft=5|in=10|abbr=mos}} tall by the time she was 10 years old)&lt;ref name="eaton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galina Espinoza (July 1, 2002).

To give her confidence because of her height, Simmons's mother enrolled her in a [[fashion modeling|modeling]] class when she was eleven years old. Two years later she was discovered by Marie-Christine Kollock (a representative for seminal Paris Agency Glamour) at a Model Search in Kansas City (organized by Kay Mitchell) and sent to [[Paris]]. 
Simmons is a graduate of [[Lutheran High School North (Missouri)|Lutheran North High School]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biography.jrank.org/pages/2705/Simmons-Kimora-Lee-Modeled-Teenager.html|title=Kimora Lee Simmons - Modeled As A Teenager|website=biography.jrank.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Modeling===

Just after her fourteenth birthday, Perkins was awarded an exclusive modeling contract with [[Chanel]] and went to work under the tutelage of Chanel designer [[Karl Lagerfeld]]. She quickly gained attention in the fashion world when she closed Lagerfeld's [[haute couture]] show in 1989. "Everything people thought was weird about me before", Perkins told ''[[People Weekly]]'', "was now good". Perkins soon walked  for designers including [[Fendi]], [[Valentino SpA|Valentino]], [[Emanuel Ungaro]] and [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]]. Perkins has been featured on the cover of the German, Indonesian, Singaporean and Malaysian editions of ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kimora Lee Simmons|url=http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/models/kimora_lee+simmons/|work=Fashion Model Directory|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Designing===
In 2004, Simmons' then husband [[Russell Simmons]] sold his clothing line [[Phat Farm]] to Kellwood Company for $140 million. When Russell stepped down as CEO of Phat Fashions LLC in September 2007, Simmons—who was already creative director of [[Baby Phat]] (which was a branch off Phat Farm Industries)—was promoted by Kellwood to President and Creative Director of Phat Fashions. It was her goal to turn fashion label [[Baby Phat]], launched in 1999, into an "aspirational lifestyle brand".&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/2020/business/story?id=1362780 Lee's 'Fabulosity'].

Accessed 2009-05-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 1, 2010, Simmons parted ways with Baby Phat and its management company, Kellwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kimora Lee's split from Baby Phat wasn't amicable; 'It's very, very sad for me,' she says at FNO|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-09-11/gossip/27075071_1_fashion-show-kimora-lee-baby-phat|work=NY Daily News |accessdate=2011-04-11|location=New York|date=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The details as to why Simmons was removed as creative director have not been clear; some blog sites claimed it was because Simmons was spending too much money on company pursuits and giving too much pay to herself and her children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kimora Lee Simmons 'dumped' from Baby Phat|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/phat_blindsided_kimora_oySW8hmUnOZmu4Fd86AiyL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=|work=New York Post|publisher=New York Post|accessdate=2011-04-11|date=August 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the split, Simmons planned to launch her KLS collection and Kouture by Kimora Brands. She had an exclusive brand coming to [[Macy's]] that would offer stylish clothes for under $40. On September 14, 2011, Simmons announced on her website that she was the new creative director and president of [[JustFab]], a personalized shopping website.&lt;ref name="kls.com"&gt;[http://kls.com/i-have-exciting-news-09-2011 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926013745/http://kls.com/i-have-exciting-news-09-2011 |date=September 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She ended her employment with [[JustFab]] in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://instagram.com/p/23nK6QIIDi/?taken-by=officialkimora |title=Instagram |publisher=Instagram |date= |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://instagram.com/p/21ZJ2QoIAF/?taken-by=officialkimora |title=Instagram |publisher=Instagram |date= |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Simmons relaunched her KLS label as a high end line, opening its first boutique in [[Beverly Hills]]. In 2016, the line began being carried at [[Bloomingdale's]] in the [[Aventura Mall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brinkley|first=Christina|title=Kimora Lee Simmons Launches a New Fashion Brand for Working Mothers |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/kimora-lee-simmons-launches-a-new-fashion-brand-for-working-mothers-1435791342|work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=2015-07-24|location=New York|date=July 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goltzman|first=Jilian|title=5 Surprising Facts About Kimora Lee Simmons|url=http://www.miami.com/5-surprising-facts-about-kimora-lee-simmons-article|work=Miami.com |accessdate=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Neighbours]]'' is an [[Television in Australia|Australian television]] [[soap opera]] first broadcast on 18 March 1985. It was created by TV executive [[Reg Watson]], who proposed the idea of making a show that focused on realistic stories and portrayed adults and teenagers who talk openly and solve their problems together. ''Neighbours'' has since become the longest-running series in Australian television and the seventh longest-running serial drama still on the air in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.watoday.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/loving-thy-neighbours-20100827-13w5c.html|title=Loving thy Neighbours|last=Quinn|first=Karl|date=28 August 2010|work=[[WA Today]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the show was inducted into the [[List of Logie Hall of Fame inductees|Logie Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvweek.ninemsn.com.au/blog.aspx?blogentryid=657831&amp;showcomments=true|title=Neighbours – Where it all began|work=[[TV Week]]|publisher=[[Ninemsn]]|accessdate=24 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520155851/http://tvweek.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=157713|archivedate=20 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first celebrity to make a guest appearance in the show was former [[Skyhooks (band)|Skyhooks]] band member [[Red Symons]]. He made his on-screen debut ten days after the series began in March 1985. He played the role of [[Terry Inglis]]' ex-husband, [[List of Neighbours characters (1985)#Gordon Miller|Gordon]]. In 1986, record producer [[Ian Meldrum|Molly Meldrum]] arrived in [[Ramsay Street]] to sign [[Charlene Robinson|Charlene Mitchell]] ([[Kylie Minogue]]) after hearing her singing backing vocals on a music demo. [[Greg Fleet]]'s appearance in 1988 saw him run over popular character [[Daphne Clarke]] ([[Elaine Smith (actress)|Elaine Smith]]) with his car,&lt;ref name="Age"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/more-power-to-new-neighbours/2007/08/01/1185647908705.html|title=More power to the 'new' Neighbours|last=Hardy|first=Marieke|date=2 August 2007|work=[[The Age]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in her death. 1995 saw [[Chris Lowe]], one half of British music group, [[The Pet Shop Boys]], appear and ask [[Helen Daniels]] ([[Anne Haddy]]) and [[Marlene Kratz]] (Moya O'Sullivan) for directions to a studio. A year later, writer [[Clive James]] had a walk on part as a postman.&lt;ref name="Age"/&gt; Australian cricketer, [[Shane Warne]] made a two episode appearance as himself in 2006. He came to [[Erinsborough]] to pick up a cheque for his charity from [[Harold Bishop]] ([[Ian Smith (actor)|Ian Smith]]). ''[[Australian Idol]]'' presenter [[Andrew Günsberg|Andrew G]] made the first of three appearances by the show's stars in February 2007. Judges [[Marcia Hines]] and [[Ian Dickson (music mogul)|Ian Dickson]] followed in November 2007 and March 2009 respectively. 

During three episodes set and filmed in London, a number of British stars filmed cameos, including [[Neil Morrissey]], [[Emma Bunton]], [[Julian Clary]] and [[Michael Parkinson]]. Morrissey was the only one of the group to play a character and not himself. British comedians [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] and [[David Walliams]] appeared as their characters, [[Lou and Andy]] and [[Tim Vine]] had a small walk on part as a lost tourist. Australian comedians [[Hamish &amp; Andy]] made their ''Neighbours'' debut as radio hosts, Fred &amp; Big Tommo and [[Lehmo]] had a cameo as himself in July 2010. The [[Erinsborough#Charlie.27s|Charlie's]] bar set provides a stage for musicians to perform their songs during episodes. September 2008 saw girl band, [[The Veronicas]] sing their song, "[[This Love (The Veronicas song)|This Love]]" on the set and Liverpudlian band, [[The Wombats]] sang three of their hits. Other singers and bands to appear at Charlie's, include [[Kate Ceberano]], [[Ben Lee]] and former ''Australian Idol'' contestant Jacob Butler. [[Australian Football League|AFL]] player [[Clint Bizzell]] began appearing as footballer [[List of Neighbours characters (2009)#Adam Clarke|Adam Clarke]] in a storyline that ran for just over a week in March 2009.

Dutch violinist [[André Rieu]] arrived in Ramsay Street in early April 2009. His cameo was later named ''Neighbours''' "weirdest ever storyline" in an online poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lastbroadcast.co.uk/soaps/features/v/8998-neighbours-weirdest-storylines-ever.html|title='Neighbours' weirdest storylines ever|publisher=Last Broadcast|accessdate=25 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5t0UfohuI?url=http://www.lastbroadcast.co.uk/soaps/features/v/8998-neighbours-weirdest-storylines-ever.html|archivedate=25 September 2010 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] wrestler [[Dave Batista]] signed up to appear in scenes with wrestling fans [[Callum Jones]] ([[Morgan Baker]]) and [[Toadfish Rebecchi]] ([[Ryan Moloney]]), during his promotional tour of Australia in June. In the same month, it was announced that British pop singer, [[Lily Allen]], was to make an appearance and perform her new single "[[22 (Lily Allen song)|22]]" on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8071502.stm|title=Lily Allen to star in Neighbours|date=28 May 2009|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen was interviewed by [[Matthew Werkmeister]]'s character, [[Zeke Kinski]], at the [[Erinsborough#Pirate Net|Pirate Net]] radio station.

'''Louise Arnold''' is an English writer of [[Children's literature]].  Her published works to date include the [[Grey Arthur]] series of novels.

==Biography==

===Personal life===
Arnold was born in [[Morden]], [[Surrey]].  She wrote her first poem aged four, and lived in [[Bognor Regis]] until she passed her A-Level exams.  She graduated from the [[University of Kent]] in 2003 with a 2.1 in drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Author: Louise Arnold | url = http://www.hodderchildrens.co.uk/Louise-Arnold_profile.htm | publisher = hodderschildrens.co.uk | accessdate = 8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While studying there, she was diagnosed with [[dyslexia]].&lt;ref name="BBCwinner"/&gt;  She now lives in [[Canterbury]], Kent.&lt;ref name="BBCwinner"&gt;{{Citation | last = Oakes | first = Keily | title = BBC winner realises writing dream | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/4672991.stm |publisher=BBC News | date = 13 July 2005 | accessdate = 30 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional life===
In&amp;nbsp;2003 the BBC News website launched a competition to find "The next [[J. K. Rowling]]".  Entrants were invited to submit the first paragraph of a children's book.  A selection of these was then put to an online public vote, which Arnold subsequently won with her entry, entitled "A not very frightening ghost".  She was signed by an agent, Kate Jones,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | title = Kate Jones | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1577748/Kate-Jones.html | date = 7 February 2008 | accessdate = 30 December 2008 | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Franklin | first = Andrew | title = Kate Jones: Literary agent with flawless taste | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/kate-jones-literary-agent-with-flawless-taste-778593.html | date = 6 February 2008 | accessdate = 30 December 2008 | location=London | work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; which then led to a publishing deal,&lt;ref name="BBCwinner"/&gt; with her first novel ''The Invisible Friend'' being released in&amp;nbsp;2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Craig | first = Amanda | title = Me and my shadow | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article543985.ece |work=The Times |location=UK | date = 16 July 2005 | accessdate = 30 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I was contacted by an agent and had to go for meetings which was very daunting because the industry was all new to me and I had little clue how it all worked...But I got lucky with the people I met and I realise how lucky I am to have this opportunity."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I was given a deadline of a year to write the book, which I delivered on time. I'm a bit of daydreamer so I needed that deadline to get me down to working."&lt;ref name="BBCwinner"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Published works==
* ''[[Golden &amp; Grey (An Unremarkable Boy and a Rather Remarkable Ghost)]]'' (2005)
* ''[[Golden &amp; Grey: The Nightmares That Ghosts Have]]'' (2006)
* ''[[Golden &amp; Grey: A Good Day for Haunting]]'' (2008)
In England, the title instead of An Unremarkable Boy and a Rather Remarkable Ghost is:
* ''[[The Invisible Friend]]''
and the title for The Nightmares That Ghosts Have is:
* ''[[The Ghost School]]''

'''Mansour bin Rashid al-Matroushi''', born 1979, is a [[Qatari]] Islamist-activist and blogger, most commonly known for his 2013 arrest and detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dohanews.co/amnesty-international-two-detained-qatari-activist-on/|title=Amnesty International: Two detained Qatari activists on hunger strike - Doha News|date=2013-04-13|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/en/originals/2013/04/gulf-states-struggle-political-islamists.html|title=Arab Gulf States Struggle Against Islamists|date=2013-04-22|language=en-us|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism and arrest ==

=== Context ===
Following the [[2012 Malian coup d'état|2012 coup in Mali]] and the political instability that followed, Islamist insurgents alongside [[Tuareg rebellion (2012)|Tuareg]] fighters began to make strategic gains. A force of 4,000 French soldiers intervened on January 11. Seven days later a cease-fire agreement was signed between Tuareg fighters and government forces; despite continuing and sporadic terrorist attacks the intervention was considered successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/20/what-mali-means-to-france/|title=What Mali means to France|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50289#.V3Fsj_krKM9|title=UN News - Deploring ongoing violence, UN rights expert urges Malian parties to work together towards lasting peace|last=Section|first=United Nations News Service|date=2015-03-10|website=UN News Service Section|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Operation Serval|France’s intervention]] in the Mali conflict came only two years after their involvement in [[NATO]] air-strikes against [[Muammar Gaddafi]]’s government forces in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-12795971|title=Libya: French plane fires on military vehicle - BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Letter to French embassy ===
On January 28th, 2013 al-Matroushi, along with 150 other activists submitted a request to Qatar’s interior ministry to orchestrate a protest in front of the French embassy in [[Doha]]. The protest was intended to criticize France’s planned military intervention in Mali.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gc4hr.org/news/view/372|title=Qatar- Human rights defenders Mohammed Issa Al-Baker and Mansoor Rashed Al- Matroushi held in incommunicado without access to families or lawyers|website=www.gc4hr.org|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The activists’ request to hold a protest was denied. Instead, al-Matroushi and a fellow activist, Mohammad Issa al-Baker, delivered a letter to the embassy which directly addressed the French ambassador.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/132849713/Qatari-activists-letter-to-the-French-Embassy&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The letter, which would later be described as “threatening” by Qatari authorities, was handed to the French on behalf of 70 activists, whose signatures were not included.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dohanews.co/qatari-activists-held-for-a-week-over-threatening/|title=Qatari activists held for a week over 'threatening' letter to French embassy - Doha News|date=2013-03-29|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tone of the letter in question is undoubtedly hostile towards French presence in not only Mali, but North Africa as well, claiming that “it is common knowledge that the crimes [France] committed in Algeria martyred more than a million Muslim persons”. It goes on to state that France is currently killing and torturing Malian Muslims, describing its policies as “terrorist” and “racist”. Perhaps the letter’s most alarming statement comes in the form of a warning: “We demand that you immediately cease your military campaign in Mali or else you would be exposing yourselves to the wrath of people who love death as much as you love life”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Within four days of receiving the letter, the French embassy reported it to Qatari authorities on March 7, but refused to comment publicly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Arrest, detention, and release ===
In the weeks following delivery of the letter, al-Matroushi had received multiple phone calls from state officials questioning him about his activism and recent activities; he was summoned to report for questioning by authorities but refused. On the 22nd of March both al-Matroushi and al-Baker were arrested by plain clothed officers on their way back from a family trip in [[Mesaieed]] (approximately 30 miles south of Doha).

The two men were held in solitary confinement with no official charge, and were re-questioned about the nature of the letter. [[Sultan al-Khalaifi]], a fellow-activist, was quoted defending the letter, saying “the letter we sent to the French embassy carried no threat. It was advice”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Al-Khalaifi was previously associated with [[Alkarama]] after his 2011 arrest by Qatari authorities.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.alkarama.org/sudan/press-releases/675-qatar-arrest-of-sultan-khulaifi-and-three-other-qatari-nationals|title=Qatar: Arrest of Sultan Khulaifi and three other Qatari nationals - Alkarama Foundation|access-date=2016-07-19}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After numerous appeals and petitions sent by Amnesty International and other human rights groups, the two men were released on April 18, but were subject to a travel-ban. Al-Matroushi later requested permission to travel to [[Egypt]] in order to pursue his education which was granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.be/je-veux-agir/agir-en-ligne/les-bonnes-nouvelles/node/10878?lang=fr|title=Qatar.Des militants Muhammad Issa , Mansour bin Rashed al-Matroushi, ont été libérés mais ne peuvent pas quitter le pays {{!}} Amnesty International Belgique Francophone|language=fr-BE|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversies and ties to extremism ===
Al-Matroushi’s close associate, al-Baker, has been tied to two U.S. designated [[al-Qaeda]] financiers and a purported charity that served as a fundraising mechanism for the [[Al-Nusra Front]] (al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/08/analysis-qatar-still-negligent-on-terror-finance.php|title=Analysis: Qatar still negligent on terror finance {{!}} The Long War Journal|website=The Long War Journal|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his alleged travel ban, Al-Baker appears in a video of a 2014 aid shipment into Syria (14), furthermore a video was uploaded from Bakr’s Twitter account which appears to have been recorded in [[Turkey]]. The video promotes Madad Ahl al-Sham, featuring collections and deliveries intended for Syria.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/Boessa73/status/439961948545769473{{dead link|date=January 2018|url=|bot=TweetCiteBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madad Ahl al-Sham was openly endorsed by Nusra Front fighters as well the group’s official social media accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/syrian-conflict-said-to-fuel-sectarian-tensions-in-persian-gulf/2013/12/18/e160ad82-6831-11e3-8b5b-a77187b716a3_story.html|title=Syrian conflict said to fuel sectarian tensions in Persian Gulf|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Baker also posted to his Twitter account the phone numbers of Sa’ad bin Sa’ad al-Ka’abi and [[Abd al-Latif Bin Abdullah Salih Muhammad al-Kawari|Abd al-Latif bin 'Abdullah al-Kawari]]. Both al-Ka’abi and al-Kawari were designated as al-Qaeda financiers and facilitators in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl0143.aspx|title=Treasury Designates Financial Supporters of Al-Qaida and Al-Nusrah Front|website=www.treasury.gov|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Al-Matroushi is associated with Alkarama, which advocated for Matroushi during his detention by authorities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The organization itself has been listed as a terrorist entity by the United Arab Emirates and two of its three founding members, Abdel Rahman al-Nuaymi and Abdul Wahab al-Humayqani, have been designated by the United States government as financiers of terror in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2249.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Alkarama’s legal director, Rachid Mesli, was arrested in [[Italy]] on August 19, 2015 under an [[Algeria]]n warrant through [[Interpol]] for his connection to the [[Islamic Salvation Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/8/26/algerian-rights-lawyer-arrested-in-italy-on-2002-arrest-warrant.html|title=Rights lawyer on house arrest in Italy accused of aiding 'terrorist group'|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Minnie the Minx''''', whose real name is '''Hermione Makepeace''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.beano.com/posts/beano-superstars-minnie|title=Beano Superstars - Minnie - Beano.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a British comic strip and comic strip character published in the comic magazine ''[[The Beano]]''. Created and originally drawn by [[Leo Baxendale]], she first appeared in issue 596, dated 19 December 1953, making her the third longest running Beano character, behind only [[Dennis the Menace (Beano Character)|Dennis the Menace]] and [[Roger the Dodger]].

Like [[Desperate Dan]] from ''[[The Dandy]]'', she has a statue in [[Dundee]].

==Character history==

===Leo Baxendale strips (1953–1962)===
Minne the Minx, created and drawn by Leo Baxendale, first appeared in ''The Beano'' in December 1953. Her first strip introduced her as "wild as wild can be" and showed her exasperated mother attempting to get her to be more creative rather than fight. Taking the book, Minnie then proceeds to beat her classmates during a revenge scheme using the scrapbook as a weapon. The closing panel shows her thanking her mother for the scrapbook stating she has "won nine scraps with it." Most of Minnie's earlier strips consisted of six-panel boxes; however, as her popularity grew, it quickly became more plausible to give Minnie her own full page with added colour. This introduced her trademark flaming red hair and red and black jersey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beano.com/retro-beano/minnie-the-minx Minnie the Minx]. ''The Beano''.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other ''Beano'' stars at the time, many of her later strips showed Minnie to get her comeuppance towards the end be it a cane, slipper or simply a case of karma. Minnie also appeared alongside [[Dennis the Menace (Beano Character)|Dennis the Menace]] in his own strip in the edition of 23 January 1954 of The Beano. In the strip, she swapped toys with Dennis for the day as she received his trusty catapult and he proceeded to 'menace' with her doll's pram. In the end, she got out of trouble scot free whilst Dennis had to suffer for all her minxing. It was possibly this that began their future eternal rivalry.

===Jim Petrie strips (1962–2001)===
[[Image:Minnie the minx.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue in Dundee]]
In 1962, when Baxendale left [[D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd|D.C. Thomson]], a new artist was taken on to continue Minnie's adventures. Young art teacher [[Jim Petrie]] was given the opportunity. His first strip, coincidentally, started similarly to Baxendale's in that Minnie is seen being asked by her mother to read rather than minx. Much to her mother's dismay, Minnie's chosen book influences her to take up red Indian traditions in which she gets up to much mischief. In the end, however, after aggravating a sleeping bull Minnie is caught by a farmer and taken home to be slippered by her father. Despite the pain, it appears Minnie still attempts to ensure to the public that she is still an Indian stating her name is 'Minnie – Ha!'. She appeared once again alongside Dennis in issue 1894, in which she states that Dennis' famous jersey are actually her trademark thus he has no right to call them 'Dennis Jerseys'.&lt;ref&gt;History of The Beano page 209&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Beano''{{'}}s 50th Anniversary issue in 1988 was significant, as an increase in the number of colour pages in the comic led to Minnie appearing in full colour for the first time. In the strip itself, Minnie dressed up as [[Pansy Potter]] in compliance with the editor's wishes. Throughout the strip she attempts impossible feats in hope to appear just like Pansy. This even consists of attempting to sink war submarines, something the old character used to do during The Beano's war times. Despite the fact she is weaker than Pansy, Minnie does manage to with-hold four sailors before they finally manage to catch her and tie her up leaving her before her father. However, previously she had filled her father's jumper with balloons and using Pansy's unique hairstyle, manages to burst the balloons causing her father to flee home in the nude, the thought of punishing his daughter forgotten.

Minnie also made a cameo in the 1992 ''Beano Annual'' story, "Dennis Through The Beano Book", in which she played the Queen of Hearts. She has also been the star of several Beanotown pantomimes, playing the role of [[Cinderella]] in each.

With the turn of the new century, Minnie was featured in a feature-length strip alongside Dennis the Menace, [[Roger the Dodger]] and [[The Bash Street Kids]]. The plot revolved around treasure which was apparently buried sometime near the end of the 19th century. Minnie was called over to Dennis' house by Roger who had gained a copy of the Treasure Map due to Smiffy, the dipsy member of The Bash Street Kids, leaving the original in the photocopier machine in Beanotown Library. Upon finding out The Bash Street Kids were also hunting for the treasure, the trio followed them to London. Once the mystery had unfolded that the treasure was buried deep in the [[Millennium Dome]] and the Bash Street Kids instantly found it and celebrated their victory. However, Dennis attempts to intimidate the treasure off of Fatty but it quickly flattened leaving Minnie and Roger to chase after Danny, who had just ran with the treasure. Finding him hiding in a storage cupboard, Roger forms a plan to get Danny to duel with Dennis for the treasure. Whilst all seems fair at first, it is quickly discovered that the three menaces had no intent on fair play when it comes to treasure and it is revealed that Roger had in fact tied Danny's catapult to a piece of string thus yanking it away at a pinnacle moment. Appearing to have won, the trio leave a humiliated Danny and head home. However, a plot quickly unravels that Roger wasn't the only one who was intent on unfair play. Danny had switched the treasure with pebbles whilst hiding in the storage cupboard. Alongside Dennis, Minnie chased Roger through the streets of Beanotown for giving Danny the opportunity to switch the treasure.

Minnie also attended Dennis the Menace's 50th Birthday House Party. Like the other guests, Minnie bought Dennis a ''Beano Annual'' 2001. She participated in all menacing party games but due to her friendship with Dennis she was one of few to not get menaced. She can also be seen fighting in the final food fight and twirling her beret when the celebrities and Dandy characters arrive.

Petrie decided to retire with his final strip appearing on 13 January 2001. The story consisted of Minnie meeting her former artist and bidding farewell. The strip was Petrie's 2000th and last, a tally for one artist drawing the same strip in the Beano only surpassed by David Sutherland on the Bash Street Kids.

===Tom Paterson strips (2001–2008)===

The following week, [[Calamity James]] artist [[Tom Paterson]] took over the strip adding his own distinct trademarks and ideas on Minnie's canon. In 2003, Brain Duane from The Dandy visited Beanotown and proceeded to mock Minnie for her lack of intelligence. Choosing brawn over brains and fuelled with jealousy over Duane's new gadget-filled car, Minnie threatened Duane into making her a custom-built skateboard. The next week, after asking to meet Dennis she proceeds to minx him with her new weapon filled vehicle. This causes Dennis to get his revenge the next week with his own Menace Buggy. It was revealed in succeeding issues that this, along with several other strips from around the same time, was a buildup to a brand new PC Game [[Beanotown Racing]]. She appeared as a playable character in the video game upon its release date in 2003.

Initially Paterson drew the vast majority of strips, with the occasional story drawn by Keith Reynolds, but by 2003 other artists such as Leslie Reavey began to ghost the strip due to Tom Paterson's workload. Through 2004 and 2005 ghosted strips became increasingly common, and eventually in early 2006 Steve Horrocks took up the artistic duties. However, in the autumn of that year Paterson returned to the strip but in a different style, the most notable change being that Minnie's Parents appeared to look very similar to those of Sweeney Toddler. However, the following year Tom Paterson's style changed again, and the changes made to her parents were largely reversed, although Minnie's Dad's moustache was still absent. In October 2007, Minnie's jumper changed colour from her familiar black and red stripes to red and yellow, with her skirt also changing from black to blue. This style was also seen on the cover of the 1965 Beano book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tonystrading.co.uk/galleries/annuals/beano.htm Beano Annual Gallery]. Tonystrading.co.uk.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ken Harrison strips (2008–2012)===
[[File:Minnie Ken Harrison.jpg|thumbnail|Minnie as she appears in the Ken Harrison strips]]

By 2007, Minnie was struggling in the readers' poll, and in early 2008 several significant changes were made in response to this. [[Iain McLaughlin]] took over as writer, and in Beano issue 3422, dated 15 March 2008, former Desperate Dan artist [[Ken H. Harrison|Ken Harrison]] took over as the strip's artist. Harrison re-introduced many aspects of Leo Baxendale's original depiction of the character and reverted her jumper to its original colours. However, the style of writing changed, with McLaughlin placing greater emphasis on the relationship between Minnie and her Dad. Some minor changes were made to her appearances, with her standard brown or grey school shoes replaced with the more modern [[trainers]]. A new tagline was introduced, citing Minnie as the World's Wildest Tom Boy, similar to Dennis the Menace's original tagline of being the World's Wildest Boy. Minnie's Teacher also became a regular character during this time, and Minnie now attends what appears to be an all-girls school. The changes reinvigorated the strip as Minnie soon returned to a top four position in the poll.

Although Harrison has been the main artist throughout this time, when he has been unavailable to draw the strip the main ghost artist has been [[Laura Howell]]. Since 2009, occasional Jim Petrie reprints have been used, particularly during the postal strikes in autumn 2009.

In the summer of 2010, Minnie began a quest for fame which received a lot of media attention in the UK. [[Cheryl Cole]], who was spotted sporting a red and black dress in her music video, was featured as well as [[Wayne Rooney]] and [[Jamie Oliver]]. Each attempt landed Minnie in more trouble than the last so in her final strip she decided to give up the search for fame and instead continue her day-to-day minxing.

On 30 July 2011, Minnie and several of her Beano co-stars were a part of a UK advertising campaign for [[National Trust]]. This included a special of The Beano which included a comic strip of her and her father exploring Northern Ireland for Finn McCool and Giant's Causeway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-beano.htm Visit]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. National Trust (17 November 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, Minnie loses her second page as it is reserved for Funsize Funnies ([[Gnasher|Gnash Gnews]], [[Little Plum]], [[Bash Street Kids|Winston]] and [[Rasher (comics)|Rasher]])

===Nigel Parkinson strips (2012–present)===
Ken Harrison drew his last Minnie the Minx strip in November 2012, drawing the first Minnie story reduced down to a single page. The week after Nigel Parkinson took over from Ken Harrison and has continued from then on, confirming he was the new Minnie artist on his blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nigelparkinsoncartoons.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/uh-oh-its-her.html|title=Uh-Oh!

Minnie also met Harry Hill, Jeremy Clarkson and Matt Smith (plus others) in the 2013 Comic Relief special. In 2014, Minnie stories went back up to two pages, with Nigel Parkinson and [[Cavan Scott]] writing the scripts.

==Personality traits==

Minnie is known as a typical tomboy, preferring mischievous and violent antics over those that would be normal for a typical ten-year-old girl. As opposed to Dennis' boisterous menacing methods, Minnie favours a more impish style of causing trouble which she refers to as 'minxing'. Despite this, she is still keen to get into brawls much like her other fellow Beano characters. She also seems to have a distinct hatred for [[snob]]-like behaviour and [[Spoilt brat|spoilt children]]. Minnie can be deemed as [[hyperactive]] as evident in several strips which show her destroying furniture in her home or a shop whilst playing one of her games. She also considers herself to be a [[Rebellion|rebel]] citing she ''hates'' people telling her what to do.

===Rivalries and friendships===
Minnie has had a problem with many of her neighbours. One example is a baby called Delilah, who had a snob of a mother. She got Minnie plenty of punishments, including extra baths. Minnie defeated her by tricking her into eating a frighteningly hot curry and embarrassing her mother. The mother had just entered Delilah in a baby contest. The curry effect on Delilah happened at the time her boastful mother had arranged for a journalist to take her photo. Her mother was similar to another mother called "Mrs Proudpants" who was boasting about her baby who she said was sure to win the contest, just like Delilah's mother. She also appears to have a small rivalry with The Bash Street Kids, as shown in feature-length strips drawn by Mike Pearse. However, she seems to be on friendly terms with the female member, Toots.

Minnie, like most characters, is depicted as a loner; however, she is shown to have a friendship with Dennis the Menace and Roger the Dodger, often seen teaming up with them in crossovers and occasionally with them in the background. Some strips have even hinted at her having a crush on Dennis and a flash-forward in the Beano Annual of 2006 revealed Dennis and Minnie eventually get married, though the canonicity of this story is debatable and two have yet to pursue a romantic interest in one another in the regular strips.

==Other characters in the strip==

===Minnie's family===
Like most DC Thomson characters, Minnie's parents are never mentioned by name; and are referred to simply as '''Minnie's dad''' and '''Minnie's mum'''. However, in issue 2258 (dated 26 October 1985), her dad reveals that his name is 'Victor'. It is unlikely this is any kind of official name, however. In the Beano Videostars it is said by his boss that Minnie's Dad's name is George, but once again it's unlikely it's an official name.

'''Chester''' is Minnie's pet cat. Chester has occasionally been seen in separate strips alongside fellow feline Beano characters Dodgecat ([[Roger the Dodger]]'s pet cat) and Winston (from [[the Bash Street Kids]]).

===Other children===
'''[[Fatty Fudge]]''' as his name suggests is a fat child. He is also sometimes called upon to assist Minnie in a particularly elaborate plot since his services can always be bought with a bag of sweets. He was briefly the subject of a spin-off strip in the early 1990s that parodied famous films, usually in ways involving the character's love of food (examples including [[You Only Live Twice (film)|'You Only Eat Rice']] and [[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|'20,000 Leeks Under The Sea']]).

'''Soppy Susan''' a character similar to [[Walter the Softy]] but a girl. The character appeared during [[Jim Petrie]]'s time as the artist and has recently returned to the strip, as well as appearing in the 2015 Beano annual.

'''The Haarm twins''' two twins who often tease Minnie but usually end up being beaten up by her. The characters began appearing in the 2000s and appear irregularly.

===Other characters===
'''PC Thyme''' is a policeman similar to Dennis the Menace's Sergeant Slipper but this character pre-dates him. This character like the aforementioned Soppy Susan mainly appeared during [[Jim Petrie]]'s time as artist however a similar character appeared during [[Tom Paterson]]'s time as the Minnie artist called PC Pimple this character was similar to PC Thyme but as the name suggests had [[pimples]].

'''Minnie's Teacher''' is as the name suggests Minnie's teacher this character is one of the newest recurring characters in the strip only appearing since Ken Harrison took over as the artist. It was revealed in Issue 3636 that she was 31. Recently, Minnie has been seen as being in Mrs Creecher's class alongside Dennis the Menace.

==Reception and legacy==

Since her debut in 1953, Minnie has been hallowed as a national treasure amongst British children for generations. Long considered one of the readers' favourite characters, she was created during what many fans feel is the Beano's golden age where other famous characters were created such as Dennis the Menace and Roger the Dodger.&lt;ref&gt;The Beano: The Story So Far....&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the Dandy's [[Desperate Dan]], she was given her own statue in Dundee in 2001. She was also featured in the line-up of McDonald's happy meal toys in Britain and has several models and figurines. As well as featuring on much of the Beano Merchandise, such as T-shirts and figures, Minnie is often featured in the comic's countless spin-offs such as videos, annuals and video games.

{{unreferenced|date=February 2015}}
'''Philemon Arthur and the Dung''' is a mysterious [[music group]] from [[Skåne|Scania]], [[Sweden]], consisting of two members known only by their [[pseudonym]]s ''Philemon Arthur'' and ''the Dung''.  The band formed in the early 1960s under the name The Popbeams, which they changed before the release of their first album which they recorded while still in their teens.  The duo's true identities are most likely known only to a few individuals at [[Silence Records]], the record label that the band has worked with since 1971.  Philemon Arthur and the Dung do not want their identities to be known, lest those who live in their small village find out who they are.
 
The band's music is recorded on [[reel-to-reel tape deck]]s with crackling [[microphone]]s and is played on untuned [[guitar]]s, [[Drum kit|drums]], and [[accordion]]s, with the occasional accompaniment of household objects such as [[saucepan]]s, [[chair]]s, and [[radiator]]s. The lyrics vary from utter [[nonsense]], such as profoundly whimsical observations about everyday life, to [[satire]] concerning social phenomena such as [[homelessness]], [[pollution]], and [[hunting]].

Despite their [[Outsider music|outsider]]-persona, the band has received much notice across Sweden.  Their surrealistic self-titled debut won a [[Grammis|Swedish Grammy]] for the best Swedish [[Gramophone record|LP]] of 1971, which came to the dismay of many.  

Modern Swedish bands like their fellow Scanians [[bob hund]] have been greatly inspired by Philemon Arthur and the Dung, and it was this eccentric duo who discovered and forwarded bob hund's [[Demo (music)|demo tape]] to Silence Records.  

[[Magnus Uggla]]'s cover of "[[In Kommer Gösta]]" was credited to M. Larsson. It is believed that [[Torekov]] natives Mats Larsson and his older brother Stellan Larsson are the (main two) members of the band, which may have more than two members performing on the albums.

'''Philip Stanhope, 2nd Earl of Chesterfield''' [[Privy Council of England|PC]] [[Royal Society|FRS]] (1634 &amp;ndash; 28 January 1714) was a peer in the peerage of England.&lt;ref name=cokayne&gt;G. E. Cokayne; with Vicary Gibbs, H.A. Doubleday, Geoffrey H. White, Duncan Warrand and Lord Howard de Walden, editors. The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant, Extinct or Dormant, new ed., 13 volumes in 14 (1910-1959; reprint in 6 volumes, Gloucester, U.K.: Alan Sutton Publishing, 2000), volume III, page 181-182; volume II, page 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He was the son of [[Henry Stanhope, Lord Stanhope]] and his wife, [[Katherine Stanhope, Countess of Chesterfield|Katherine Wotton]].&lt;ref name=cokayne/&gt; He inherited the title of [[Earl of Chesterfield]] on the death of his  grandfather in 1656.&lt;ref name=cokayne/&gt; He was educated by Poliander, Professor of Divinity at Leyden (1640) and at the [[Orange College of Breda|Prince of Orange's College at Breda]]. In 1669 he was awarded the degree of [[Doctor of Civil Laws]] by the [[University of Oxford]].
[[File:Elizabeth Stanhope, by Peter Cross.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Elizabeth Dormer ([[Peter Cross (painter)|Peter Cross]], 1667)]]
His first marriage was to Lady Anne Percy, daughter of the [[Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]]. Following her death, a marriage had been arranged between him and Mary, daughter of [[Anne Fairfax|Anne]] and [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|3rd Lord Fairfax]]. Despite the fact the [[banns of marriage|banns]] had been read twice, Mary jilted Chesterfield for the [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|2nd Duke of Buckingham]] with whom she had fallen in love.&lt;ref name=george&gt;Bruce Yardley, ‘Villiers, George, second duke of Buckingham (1628–1687)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2009 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/28294, accessed 10 April 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; Chesterfield subsequently married [[Elizabeth Butler Stanhope, Countess of Chesterfield|Elizabeth Butler]], daughter of [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde]] and his wife, [[Elizabeth Butler, Duchess of Ormonde|Elizabeth Preston]].&lt;ref name=cokayne/&gt; They had one daughter, [[Elizabeth Lyon, Countess of Strathmore|Lady Elizabeth]] (from whom descends [[Queen Elizabeth II]]), but it is not certain that Chesterfield was the father. Elizabeth died in 1665, and he married a third time to the second  daughter of [[Charles Dormer, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon]], [[Elizabeth Stanhope, Countess of Chesterfield (d. 1677)|Lady Elizabeth Dormer]], who finally provided him with two sons.&lt;ref name=cokayne/&gt;

According to [[Samuel Pepys]], Chesterfield was a ladies' man, and had been one of the many lovers of [[Barbara Villiers]], the most notorious mistress of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].  His second wife, tired of his neglect, began flirting with the king's brother, the [[James II of England|Duke of York]], and also with [[James Hamilton (colonel)|James Hamilton]].

He was imprisoned in the Tower of London for wounding Captain John Whalley in a duel (1658) and on suspicion of involvement in Sir George Booth's rising (1659). He also killed a man in a duel, fled to France, and having obtained pardon from Charles II, returned to England in his train (1660).

==Career==
He was Lord Chamberlain to [[Catherine of Braganza]] (1662–1665) and a member of her Council (1670). He was Colonel of a regiment of foot (1667, 1682), a Privy Councillor (1681) and the Warden of the royal forests south of Trent (1679). He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in November 1708.&lt;ref name=cokayne/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=3&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27stanhope%27%29|title=Library and Archive Catalog|publisher=Royal Society|accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at his home in Middlesex, and was buried in Shelford, Nottinghamshire.

His television program, ''Breakthrough with Rod Parsley'', airs daily on the [[Daystar (TV network)|Daystar]] TV Network, the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]], and [[The Word Network]].

==Early life and education==
Parsley was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and was raised primarily in the Columbus area. His parents had grown up in eastern [[Kentucky]], and his family traveled there often to visit relatives when Parsley was a young boy. He was raised as a [[Free Will Baptist]], and had a "born-again" experience at Christian Center Church in [[Gahanna, Ohio]], in the 1970s. 

After graduating from high school, he worked in real estate and at a pet-food factory. He enrolled at [[Ohio Christian University|Circleville Bible College]] (now Ohio Christian University),&lt;ref name="Dennis M. Mahoney 2005"/&gt; but dropped out after two years.&lt;ref name="Ted Wendling 2005"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wendling|first1=Ted|title=Ohio televangelist has plenty of influence, but he wants more|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-07-01/news/0507010197_1_pastor-rod-parsley-ohio-secretary-state-ken-blackwell|website=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young pastor, Parsley was strongly influenced by [[Lester Sumrall|Dr. Lester Sumrall]], an Indiana-based evangelist, missionary and broadcaster. Sumrall became Parsley's mentor, and the two traveled together often.&lt;ref name="Dennis M. Mahoney 2005"/&gt;  

He is married to Joni Parsley. They have a son, Austin, and a daughter, Ashton, now grown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joniparsley.com/ "Joni Parsley - A bit about me"]; retrieved July 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They live near [[Pickerington, Ohio|Pickerington]], a suburb of Columbus.

==World Harvest Church==
{{main|World Harvest Church}}
Parsley founded his church in 1977, after leading a Bible study in his parents' back yard while still a college student. Seventeen people attended the first meeting.&lt;ref name="whclife.com"/&gt; They soon decided that the Bible study group should become a church. It originally became known as Sunset Chapel, and later Word of Life Church. 

The church's first permanent facility was built in 1979. This is now known as Alpha Hall, one of four buildings on what for many years was the campus of Valor Christian College (the college moved to the main church campus in 2011). Growth soon required an addition to that building, and several years later the church built a bigger structure adjacent to Alpha Hall, now known as Dominion Hall. In 1986, ground was broken on {{convert|57|acre|m2}} to begin what is now the church's main campus in Canal Winchester (with a Columbus address). When it was dedicated, it was renamed as World Harvest Church in honor of [[Lester Sumrall]], who had befriended Parsley years earlier and became the younger pastor's mentor.&lt;ref name="whclife.com"&gt;[http://www.whccolumbus.com/our-story "About World Harvest Church"]; retrieved November 9, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rodparsley.com/assets/pdf/Prp-Biography.pdf Parsley's official biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

World Harvest Church Columbus now includes a 5,200-seat sanctuary, children's and youth ministries, Connect Centers and administrative offices. Harvest Preparatory School, a private [[Christian]] school serving students in preschool through grade 12, and Valor Christian College also operate on the church grounds.&lt;ref name="whclife.com"/&gt; About 10,000 people attend services at World Harvest on a weekly basis.&lt;ref name="Dennis M. Mahoney 2005"&gt;Dennis M. Mahoney, "Higher aspirations", ''The Columbus Dispatch'', August 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, World Harvest added a satellite campus in Elkhart. That church is located near Christian Center Church in [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]], the church founded by Parsley's mentor, Sumrall.

==Other ministry activities==
''Breakthrough'' is an outreach of Bridge of Hope, an international missions organization. Over the past 20 years, Parsley has led numerous humanitarian projects around the world, supported by gifts from his church members, churches affiliated with the World Harvest Ministerial Alliance and television viewers. Bridge of Hope has an exhaustive record of work in [[Sudan]], where a civil war has persisted for years. His involvement with Sudan began with his lobbying for the federal [[Sudan Peace Act]], and has encompassed the purchase of freedom for Sudanese Christian slaves as well as food, medical supplies and equipment for freed slaves. Bridge of Hope has purchased the freedom of more than 31,000 slaves and provided more than 16,000 "survival kits" — aid packages consisting of a tarp, mosquito netting, a cooking pot and food to sustain a family for a month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rodparsley.com/boh/bohm_Sudan.aspx "Bridge of Hope - Missions: Sudan"]; retrieved July 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bridge of Hope has also completed projects in the African nations of Zambia, Uganda, Kenya and Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;"Bridge of Hope: Missions - Africa," http://www.rodparsley.com/boh/bohm_africa.aspx, retrieved 7-15-10&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's history also includes projects in Europe, Asia, South America, Central America and the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="rodparsley.com"&gt;[http://www.rodparsley.com/boh "Bridge of Hope"], rodparsley.com; retrieved July 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; its most recent international projects have been in Haiti (both before and after the January 2010 earthquake there) and Guatemala.&lt;ref name="rodparsley.com"/&gt;

Domestically, Bridge of Hope has been involved in disaster relief, providing food, water, ice and cleaning supplies in the wake of disasters including Hurricanes Katrina, Gustav and Ike. Following these disasters, Bridge of Hope was named a First Responder by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.&lt;ref&gt;"Bridge of Hope: Missions - Gulf Coast" http://www.rodparsley.com/boh/bohm_gulfcoast.aspx, retrieved 7-15-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valor Christian College was founded in 1990 as World Harvest Bible Institute, and was later known as World Harvest Bible College. It attracts students from across the United States and around the world for ministry training in pastoral leadership, missions, evangelism, music ministry, youth ministry, media ministry, advanced leadership and interdisciplinary studies. It is accredited by the Ohio Department of Higher Education to offer associate of applied science degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valorcollege.edu/ Valor Christian College website], valorcollege.edu; retrieved July 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activism==
Parsley is a political independent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmc.rodparsley.com/Perspective.aspx?id=46 "My Declaration of Independence"]; retrieved June 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He is a critic of [[liberal (politics)|liberal]] positions on [[social issues]], including abortion&lt;ref&gt;Rod Parsley, "Silent No More", p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; and the movement to expand the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmc.rodparsley.com/Perspective.aspx?id=30 "Marriage on Trial in California"]; retrieved June 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also worked on behalf of prison re-entry legislation, women's rights initiatives and [[poverty reduction|anti-poverty program]]s. His most recent book, ''Living on Our Heads'', singles out [[Chris Matthews]], [[Bart Stupak]], [[Mia Farrow]] and the late [[Christopher Hitchens]] for praise.&lt;ref&gt;''Living on Our Heads'', pp. 175-183&lt;!--publisher, ISSN/ISBn needed.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsley became increasingly involved in U.S. politics following his work on the 2003 [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]]. During the summer of 2004, Parsley announced the establishment of the Center for Moral Clarity. He openly criticized [[Sweden]] for the conviction of [[Åke Green]] under [[Sweden]]'s [[hate crime]]s legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100917091303/http://apologeticscourses.com/?p=42 The Mind Is Connected To the Spirit : Seminary for Apologetics], apologeticscourses.com; accessed October 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, 2004, Parsley gave a [[sermon]] titled "Uncensored: While Freedom Still Rings". In the two-part sermon, Parsley expressed opposition to the view that there is a [[separation of church and state]] in the [[U.S. Constitution]]; [[same-sex marriage]]; [[partial-birth abortion]]; [[hate speech]] legislation in [[California]], [[Canada]], and [[Sweden]]; [[sexual orientation]] themes in children's books; [[racism]]; and [[poverty]]. Parsley has said that the U.S. government, by funding [[Planned Parenthood]], is complicit in [[black genocide]], that is, genocide against [[African American]]s, because Planned Parenthood performs abortions in the black community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMaaDbGgsKA "Rod Parsley: More on 'Black Genocide'], YouTube.com; accessed October 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few weeks before the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 elections]], Parsley encouraged both his congregation and his television audience to vote for Ohio's state constitutional amendment which defines marriage as the union between one man and one woman. The amendment passed by a wide margin of votes from both political parties. Parsley has also encouraged citizens of other states with similar marriage amendments on their ballots to vote similarly, and he headlined the "Silent No More" tour in order to register Christian voters.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Writings==
Parsley is an author of several books, including "Silent No More," which was released in April 2005 by Charisma House. The book encourages Christians to participate in the political process, and especially to make sure their votes reflect their values. Concerning poverty, Parsley writes that government should "get out of the way," removing many constraints on [[capitalism]]. "If the government were to reduce the level of taxation, remove industrial restraints, eliminate wage controls, and abolish subsidies, tariffs, and other constraints on free enterprise," he writes, "the poor would be helped in a way that AFDC, social security, and unemployment insurance could never match."&lt;ref&gt;"Silent No More," pp.64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequel, ''Culturally Incorrect: How Clashing Worldviews Affect Your Future'', was published in June 2007 and soon appeared on the industry's best-seller lists.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Posner, "God's Profits: Faith, Fraud, and the Republican Crusade for Values Voters", p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; "Culturally Incorrect" identifies postmodernism - the belief that there is no such thing as absolute truth - as the cause of many of the culture's major ills, and calls upon Christians to impact the culture through prayer, service to the poor and activism. A third book on Christian moral action, "Living on Our Heads: Righting an Upside-Down Culture,"&lt;ref&gt;http://livingonourheads.com&lt;/ref&gt; was released in August 2010.

His latest book is called "The Finale: One World, One Ruler, One Reign," released in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Finale-One-World-Ruler-Reign/dp/1629991732&lt;/ref&gt;

==McCain 2008 endorsement==
Parsley personally endorsed the [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2008|presidential campaign]] of [[Republican Party (USA)|Republican]] nominee [[John McCain]], who called Parsley a "spiritual guide". McCain had actively sought Parsley's endorsement during his Republican [[primary election|primary]] battle with [[Mike Huckabee]], who was drawing substantial support from the [[Christian right|religious right]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Ross (journalist)|Ross, Brian]]. [http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=4905624&amp;page=1 "McCain Pastor: 'Islam is a Conspiracy of Spiritual Evil'"], [[ABC News]], May 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

McCain later rejected Parsley's endorsement based on Parsley's statements regarding Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/05/mccain-rejects.html Political Radar: McCain Rejects Parsley Endorsement], abcnews.com, May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsley was quoted as stating that he "do[es] not believe that our country can truly fulfill its divine purpose until we understand America was founded, in part, with the intention of seeing this false religion destroyed" and that [[Muhammad]] is "the mouthpiece of a conspiracy of spiritual evil".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/23/us/politics/23hagee.html?em&amp;ex=1211688000&amp;en=cac841d277244547&amp;ei=5087%0A "McCain Cuts Ties to Pastor Whose Talks Drew Fire"], ''[[New York Times]]'', May 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=4905624&amp;page=1 McCain Pastor: 'Islam is a Conspiracy of Spiritual Evil'], abcnews.go.com, May 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In repudiating Parsley's comments, McCain stated, "I believe there is no place for that kind of dialogue in America, and I believe that even though he endorsed me, and I didn't endorse him, the fact is that I repudiate such talk, and I reject his endorsement."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120728113409/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/politics/national/stories/052308dnmethagee.37d3563.html "McCain rejects televangelist Hagee's endorsement"], dallasnews.com; accessed October 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; McCain further distanced himself from Parsley, stating, "I've never been in [[John Hagee|Pastor Hagee]]'s church or Pastor Parsley's church. I didn't attend their church for 20 years, and I'm not a member of their church. I received their endorsement, which did not mean that I endorsed their views."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/politics/la-na-mccain23-2008may23,0,5141859.story "John McCain repudiates pastors' support"], latimes.com; accessed October 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter, Parsley withdrew his endorsement of McCain's candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120903190744/http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2008/05/24/parsley.html?sid=101 Rev. Rod Parsley withdraws McCain endorsement], ''The Columbus Dispatch'', May 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of Parsley==
Parsley is identified as a prominent player in the so-called [[Dominionism|dominionist]] movement by both [[TheocracyWatch]]&lt;ref name=Patriot_Pastors&gt;[http://www.theocracywatch.org/ohio_patriot_pastors.htm "The Rise of the Religious Right in the Republican Party: Ohio's Patriot Pastors"], ''[[TheocracyWatch]]''; accessed October 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and commentator [[Bill Moyers]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Moyers]].  [http://www.theocracywatch.org/new_bill_moyers_toompaine_sept9_05.htm 9/11 And The Sport of God], ''[[TheocracyWatch]]'', September 9, 2005. URL accessed May 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have criticized Parsley's recent book, ''Silent No More'', because of the book's description of Islam and its view that the [[United States Constitution]] provides for a separation of church and state (among other social issues), and for his support of [[faith healing]]. Parsley supports the claim that Islam is an enemy of both the United States and [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name="motherjones"&gt;[[David Corn|Corn, David]].  [https://www.motherjones.com/washington_dispatch/2008/03/john-mccain-rod-parsley-spiritual-guide.html McCain's Spiritual Guide: Destroy Islam], [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]], 2008-03-12&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, a group of 31 [[Columbus, Ohio]]-area pastors charged that Parsley and another central Ohio religious leader had violated federal tax laws. The complaining clergy alleged that Parsley violated the tax-exempt status of his church by supporting various political causes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbusdispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2006/01/17/20060117-A1-01.html Laws of man, God obeyed, World Harvest Church says]{{dead link|date=January 2017}}, [[The Columbus Dispatch]], 2006-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100329230928/http://www.dispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2006/01/16/20060116-A1-00.html "Churches could face IRS probe"], [[The Columbus Dispatch]], January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Chris Hedges]]' 2006 book ''[[American Fascists|American Fascists: The Christian Right and the War on America]]'' quoted Parsley as using [[militarism|militaristic]] metaphors in a sermon concerning his critics:{{cquote|The [[secular]] media never likes it when I say this, so let me say it twice. Man your battle stations! Ready your weapons! They say this rhetoric is so inciting. I came to incite a riot. ... Man your battle stations. Ready your weapons. Lock and load &amp;mdash; for the thirty, forty liberal pastors who filed against our ministry with the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. ... Let the struggle begin. Let it begin in your heart today with a shout unto him who has called us to war &amp;mdash; not only that, he has empowered you and I to win.&lt;ref name="Hedges"&gt;[[Chris Hedges|Hedges, Chris]].

==Cancer==
In 2015, Parsley was treated for [[throat cancer]], but has since recovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charismanews.com/us/52753-battling-throat-cancer-rod-parsley-shares-the-battle-against-his-mind Rod Parsley shares the battle],  charismanews.com; accessed October 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sebile''', alternatively written as '''Sedile''', '''Sebille''', '''Sibilla''', '''Sibyl''' and other similar names, is a mythical medieval queen or princess who is frequently portrayed as a [[fairy]] or an [[enchantress (fantasy)|enchantress]] in the [[Arthurian legends]] and [[Italian folklore]]. She appears in a variety of roles, from the most faithful and noble lady to a wicked seductress, often in relation with or substituting for the character of [[Morgan le Fay]]. Some tales feature her as a wife of either King [[Charlemagne]] or Prince [[Lancelot]], and even as the mother of [[King Arthur]].

==Origins==
[[File:Domenichino - The Cumaean Sibyl - WGA06405.jpg|thumb|''The Cumaean Sibyl'' by [[Domenichino]] (17th century)]]

The character of Sebile has her earliest roots in the [[Ancient Greek]] figure of the priestess prophetess known as the [[Cumaean Sibyl]]. This was later transmuted into a [[Interpretatio Christiana|Christianized]] character named Sibyl in the Christian mythology of the [[Early Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=fay/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jG0bAAAAYAAJ|title=The tragedy of knighthood: origins of the Tannhäuser legend|first=J.

==Matter of France==
Queen Sebile first appears in text in the [[Matter of France]]'s ''Chanson des Saisnes'' (''The Song of the Saxons'', written c. 1200) as the young and beautiful second&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/specimensofoldf00toyn|title=Specimens of Old French, IX-XV centuries.

Queen Sebile falls in love with the Frankish king [[Charlemagne]]'s nephew and [[Roland]]'s brother, Baudoin, for whom she betrays her husband.

Sebile makes her first known appearance in an Arthurian legend in [[Ulrich von Zatzikhoven]]'s late 12th-century German poem ''[[Lanzelet]]'', in which the loving [[fairy]] mistress of Prince [[Lancelot]] is named '''Iblis''' (''Yblis''), an anagram for Sibil/Sybil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/roma_0035-8029_1959_num_80_319_3184|title=Morgain la fée in oral tradition|first=Roger Sherman|last=Loomis|publisher=|journal=Romania|volume=80|issue=319|pages=337–367|doi=10.3406/roma.1959.3184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SDtlAAAAMAAJ|title=Suites romanesques du Merlin en prose|first=Nathalie|last=Koble|date=2007|publisher=Paradigme|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, she is the only daughter of Iweret of the Beautiful Forest (''Beforet''), an enemy of the family of Lancelot's foster mother, the sea fairy Queen of the Maidenland.

The next day, the Queens appear before the awoken Lancelot in their finest clothes and ask him to choose one of them as a lover; if he refuses, he will never leave his prison. Despite this threat, Lancelot, faithful to his secret beloved, Queen [[Guinevere]], categorically and with contempt refuses all three "lewd witches". Humiliated and angered by this, the queens throw Lancelot into a dungeon; he is later freed by the daughter of the King of Norgales' enemy (either the Duke of Rochedon or King Bagdemagus of Gore), who asks him to fight for her father in an upcoming tournament.

In the Venician ''Les Prophéties de Merlin'' (written c. 1276),&lt;ref name=ts/&gt; Sebile is part of a quartet of enchantresses: besides Sebile and Morgan (Morgain, ''Morghain'', ''Morghe''), here being her only lover among all the women, they include also the Queen of Norgales and the Lady of Avalon (''Dame d'Avalon'').

In the anonymous French prose romance ''[[Perceforest]]'' (written c. 1330), the most beautiful, wise and honorable enchantress Sebile is known variably as '''Sebile of the Lake''' (''Sebile du Lac'') or the '''Lady of the Lake, Sebile of the Red Castle''' (''Dame du Lac, Sebile du Chastel Vermei''). In this tale, King Arthur is the son of Sebile and Alexander (derived from [[Alexander the Great]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.75962|title=Authors Digest Volume XX A Dictionary Of Famous Names In Fiction Drama Poetry History And Art|first=|last=|date=1908|publisher=Authors Press|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Alexander is at first a young knight before becoming King Alexander of England and then battling to conquer the world. Sebile falls in love with Alexander on sight; she incites him into her mist-concealed Castle of the Lake (later the Red Castle) by magic and keeps him there through seduction. Their mutual love then grows, especially after Sebile nurses him back to health from a grave wound and Alexander lifts a siege of her castle by defeating her enemies. In one episode, travelling Sebile is attacked by four evil knights who want to rape her, but the Scottish knight [[Sir Tor|Tor of Pedrac]] arrives at the last moment and slays the villains (their severed heads are then preserved with a spell and given to him as a memorial of this deed). After Alexander dies, Sebile marries Vestige of Joy (the knight of the Black Eagle) and gives him a daughter named Alexandre, also known as the Maiden of the Two Dragons. Other characters include her cousin Gloriane, the lady of Castle Darnant.&lt;ref name=fay/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pas&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N48vCgAAQBAJ|title=Prophecy and Sibylline Imagery in the Renaissance: Shakespeare’s Sibyls|first1=Jessica L.|last1=Malay|first2=Reader in Early Modern Literature Jessica L.|last2=Malay|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_gc1P52bToC|title=Perceforest: The Prehistory of King Arthur's Britain|publisher=DS Brewer|via=Google Books|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924026991442|title=Character sketches of romance, fiction and the drama|first=Ebenezer Cobham|last=Brewer|date=1896|publisher=New York, E.

In central Italy, Sebile features in a local version of the [[Venusberg (mythology)|Venusberg]] motif from [[Germanic mythology]].&lt;ref name=sibilla&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/studimedievali04centuoft|title=Studi medievali|first=|last=Centro italiano di studi sull'alto Medioevo|publisher=Spoleto [etc.]|via=Internet Archive|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Paradise of Queen Sebile'' (''Le Paradis de la Reine Sebile'', ''Il paradise della regina Sibilla''), [[Antoine de la Sale]] records a folk legend that he heard from locals at the aptly-named mountain [[Monte Sibilla]] in 1420: Sebile/Sibilla is depicted as a demonic fay sorceress who lives with an entourage of amorous nymphs in magnificent palaces and lush gardens within a subterranean, paradise-like enchanted realm (inspired by Morgan's Avalon). She welcomes guests to her kingdom of carnal pleasure (''voluttà''), but, if, entangled in the delights, they spend more than a year there, the guests are trapped forever in sinful bliss, waiting for the [[Last Judgment]] with the fairies.&lt;ref name=tl/&gt;&lt;ref name=sibilla/&gt;

In de la Sale's ''La Salade'' (written c. 1440), a German knight and his squire enter Queen Sebile's kingdom out of curiosity and revel for a year in its forbidden pleasures. Before it is too late for him, the knight realizes the sinfulness of this by witnessing how the fair ladies transform each week into adders and scorpions for a night, so he escapes and hurries to Rome to confess to the Pope just in time. The squire, who regrets having left the pleasures of the fairy realm, flees him and returns to the Sebile's earthly paradise; the Pope sends out messengers with the news of his absolution, but they arrive too late.&lt;ref name=tl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sibylla.it/biblioteca-virtuale/110-il-paradiso-della-regina-sibilla.html|title=Il paradiso della regina Sibilla|first=Andrea|last=Gentili|website=www.sibylla.it|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sibilla is gifted with her famed prophetic powers, but tells only bad news, never good.&lt;ref name=sibilla/&gt; In a similar story included within [[Andrea da Barberino]]'s prose chivalric romance ''[[Il Guerrin Meschino]]'' (the part written c. 1391), a pious knight, advised to seek out the fay Sebile (''fée Sébile'') in her abode in the mountain near [[Norcia]], goes through a cave to her realm; he stays there for a year, but refuses all temptation and only attempts to learn about his parentage, without success. He boldly resists the flattering advances of the fay and her damsels, whose sinister nature he suspects, but later too receives an absolution after confessing to the Pope in any case.&lt;ref name=tl&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/jstor-27700209|title=The Origin of the Tannhäuser-Legend: The Present State of the Question|first=Arthur F.

Sibilla is also a recurring character in Italian works of the 16th century, such as in [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]]'s ''L'Italia liberata dai Goti'' (1547).&lt;ref name=tl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/litalialiberata00antogoog|title=L'Italia liberata da' Goti di Giangiorgio Trissino|author=Annibale Antonini, Giovanni Giorgio Trissino|date=1729|publisher=|via=Internet Archive|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names and characters of Sibilla, Morgan le Fay (''Fata Morgana'') and the fairy queen Alcina are often interchangeable in Italian tales of fairies; for example, Morgan substitutes for Sibilla in P.A. Caracciolo's 15th-century ''Magico''.&lt;ref name=sibilla/&gt; [[Pietro Aretino]]'s 16th-century ''Ragionamenti'' mentions a certain "sister of Sibilla of Norcia and aunt of Morgan the Fairy (Fata Morgana)".&lt;ref name=sibilla/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pelagus.org/it/libri/RAGIONAMENTO,_di_Pietro_Aretino_15.html|title=RAGIONAMENTO, di Pietro Aretino - pagina 15|website=www.pelagus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene of Lancelot's abduction also features in the adventure video game ''[[Lancelot (video game)|Lancelot]]''. She also appears in some other works, such as in Kate SeRine's novel ''Red'', where the villain Sebille Fenwick is a [[sidhe]] enchantress who survived to the modern times, and in J.M. Owens's ''Farewell to Avalon'', where she was one of the high priestesses of Avalon before Nimue.

'''Sibel Deniz Edmonds''' is a former contract [[translator]] for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the founder and editor-in-chief of the independent news website [[NewsBud]]. 

The FBI hired her as a translator shortly after [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] but fired her after less than seven months.  She identified herself as a [[whistleblower]] and challenged her termination; however, the courts dismissed her lawsuit for wrongful termination because the FBI would need to disclose privileged information.  She accused a colleague of covering up illicit activity involving Turkish nationals, alleged serious security breaches and cover-ups and that intelligence had been deliberately suppressed, endangering national security. {{r|forsale}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FBI denies file exposing nuclear secrets theft|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/world_news/article79024.ece|publisher=The Sunday Times|date=20 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Calvert|first1=Jonathan|last2=Lauria|first2=Joe|title=Tip-off thwarted nuclear spy ring probe|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/world_news/article79562.ece|publisher=The Sunday Times|date=27 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PEN American Center awarded her the PEN/Newman’s Own First Amendment Award in 2006 for her claims.&lt;ref name="pen-sibel-edmonds"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pen.org/press-release/2006/03/29/2006-pennewmans-own-first-amendment-award |title=2006 PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award |author=Larry Siems |work=PEN American Center |date=29 March 2006 |accessdate=20 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NXREWwDr?url=http://www.pen.org/press-release/2006/03/29/2006-pennewmans-own-first-amendment-award |archivedate=20 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She published a memoir in March 2012, titled ''Classified Woman – The Sibel Edmonds Story''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classifiedwoman.com/ |title=The Sibel Edmonds Story &amp;#124; A Memoir |publisher=Classified Woman |date= |accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
The daughter of an [[Iranian Azerbaijanis|Iranian Azerbaijani]] father and [[Turkish people|Turkish]] mother,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kkc.com/our-firm/meet-the-whistleblowers/sibel-edmonds/|title=Sibel Edmonds|work=KKC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edmonds lived in Iran and then Turkey before coming to the United States as a student&lt;ref name="vanity_fair"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article9774.htm|title=An Inconvenient Patriot|last=Rose |first=David |magazine=Vanity Fair|date=15 August 2005 |accessdate=9 December 2016}} "But as a naturalized Turkish-American, she saw the job as her patriotic duty."&lt;/ref&gt; in 1988. Fluent in [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[English language|English]],&lt;ref name="vanity_fair"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nswbc_staff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nswbc.org/nswbc_staff.htm|title=National Security Whistleblowers Coalition – About Us|accessdate=15 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kill The Messenger (2006)"&gt;{{citation |title=Kill The Messenger (2006) documentary |publisher=CANAL+ / Zadig Productions|date=2006 |quote=from 4m47s to 4m55s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edmonds earned her bachelor's degree in [[criminal justice]] and [[psychology]] from [[George Washington University]]&lt;ref name="vanity_fair"/&gt; and her master's in [[public policy]] and international [[commerce]] from [[George Mason University]].&lt;ref name="nswbc_staff"/&gt;

==FBI employment==
Edmonds worked for the FBI for six months from late September 2001 until March 2002. Edmonds was hired, as a contractor, to work as an interpreter in the translations unit of the FBI in Washington on {{r|independent2004}} September 13, September 15 or September 20, 2001. Among her main roles was to translate covertly recorded conversations by Turkish diplomatic and political targets.{{r|forsale}}

Edmonds filed complaints about the FBI's [[Office of Professional Responsibility]] and the [[United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General]]. In response, she claims that managers retaliated{{r|justa}} against her, and she was fired on 22 March 2002. In June 2002, the [[Associated Press]] and ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' reported that the FBI claimed Edmonds was dismissed because her actions were disruptive and breached security and that she performed poorly at her job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-70274620.html|title=FBI Told to Give Papers to Whistleblower|work=highbeam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 internal investigation by the FBI Office of the Inspector General found that many of Edmonds's allegations of misconduct "had some basis in fact" and that "her allegations were at least a contributing factor in the FBI’s decision to terminate her services," but were unable to substantiate all of her allegations, nor did they make a statement regarding her dismissal being improper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Review of the FBI's Actions in Connection With Allegations Raised By Contract Linguist Sibel Edmonds|url=https://fas.org/irp/agency/doj/oig/sedmonds.html|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice - Office of the Inspector General}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edmonds's allegations of impropriety at the FBI later came to the attention of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]], which held unclassified hearings on the matter on 17 June 2002, and 9 July 2002. During the hearings, the FBI provided various unclassified documents and statements relating to the case, which led to Senators [[Patrick Leahy]] and [[Chuck Grassley]] sending letters, dated 19 June 2002, 13 August 2002, and 28 October 2002 – to Inspector General [[Glenn A. Fine]], Attorney General [[John Ashcroft|Ashcroft]], and FBI Director [[Robert Mueller]], respectively – asking for explanations and calling for an independent audit of the FBI's translation unit. These documents were published on the Senators' web sites.{{r|aclu}}{{r|grassley}}{{r|"leahy.senate.gov"}}

==Post-FBI==

In April 2004, Edmonds claimed she had provided information to the panel investigating the [[September 11 attacks]] in February that year. Although she started work shortly after 9/11 and worked for just over six months, she claimed knowledge of information circulating within the FBI during spring and summer of 2001. The session was closed and over three hours long, she said. Reportedly, she told the commission that the FBI knew of a planned attack months away and the terrorists were in place. She stated, "There was general information about the time-frame, about methods to be used but not specifically about how they would be used and about people being in place and who was ordering these sorts of terror attacks. There were other cities that were mentioned. Major cities with skyscrapers."{{r|independent2004}} On the 26th, a deposition of Edmonds was quashed under the state secrets privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strohm |first1=Chris |title=Quashed Testimony |url=http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0404/043004lb.htm |publisher=Government Executive |date=30 April 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803120226/http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0404/043004lb.htm |archivedate=3 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 May 2004, Ashcroft submitted statements to justify the use of the [[state secrets privilege]] against the planned deposition by Edmonds,&lt;ref name=burnett_ashcroft/&gt; and the same day, the FBI retroactively classified as [[Top Secret]] all of the material and statements that had been provided to the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] in 2002 relating to Edmonds's own lawsuit, as well as the letters that had been sent by the Senators and republished by the [[Project on Government Oversight]].&lt;ref name=pogo_somf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pogo.org/about/press-room/releases/2004/gs-oc-20040623.html|title=POGO v. John Ashcroft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June 2004, the retroactive reclassification was challenged in a suit filed by the Project on Government Oversight, citing fear that the group might be retroactively punished for having published the letters on its website. The Justice Department tried to get the suit dismissed, and the Justice Department explicitly approved their release to the Project on Government Oversight.{{r|wp1}} The reclassification did, however, keep Edmonds from testifying in the class action suit as well as her own whistleblower suit.{{r|wp3}}{{r|wp4}} The latter decision was appealed, and Inspector General Glenn A. Fine released a summary of the audit report, claiming "that many of her allegations were supported, that the FBI did not take them seriously enough, and that her allegations were, in fact, the most significant factor in the FBI's decision to terminate her services. Rather than investigate Edmonds's allegations vigorously and thoroughly, the FBI concluded that she was a disruption and terminated her contract."{{r|usdoj}}

In August 2004, Edmonds founded the [[National Security Whistleblowers Coalition]] (NSWBC), which exists to assist national security whistleblowers through advocacy and reform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nswbc.org/purpose.htm National Security Whistleblowers Coalition] purpose message. URL accessed 20 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edmonds|first1=Sibel|title=Newsbud’s Warning on the Fake News Bucket List - Watch out for the Wolves in Sheep’s Clothing|url=http://www.newsbud.com/2016/11/30/newsbuds-warning-on-the-fake-news-bucket-list-watch-out-for-the-wolves-in-sheeps-clothing/|website=NewsBud|publisher=NewsBud|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edmonds|first1=Sibel|title=Newsbud’s Warning on the Fake News Bucket List - Watch out for the Wolves in Sheep’s Clothing|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O73ajATm_NE|website=YouTube|publisher=NewsBud|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edmonds is also the founder and publisher of the ''[[Boiling Frogs Post]]'', an online media site that aims to offer nonpartisan investigative journalism.&lt;ref name="About Boiling Frogs Post"/&gt;

In September 2005, Edmonds claimed in Vanity Fair that a price was set for [[Dennis Hastert]] to withdraw support for the [[Armenian Genocide]] resolution. That the "... Turkish Consulate ... claimed in one recording that the price for Hastert to withdraw the resolution would have been at least $500,000."{{r|vf2005}}{{r|courier}}

In September 2006, a documentary about Edmonds's case called ''[[Kill the Messenger (2006 film)|Kill the Messenger]]'' (''Une Femme à Abattre'') premiered in France.{{r|"kill"}} The film discusses the Edmonds case and offers interviews with various involved individuals. 

Edmonds gave testimony in August 2009 and gave information that had twice previously been gagged under state secrets privilege.{{r|deposition}}{{r|huffdep}}

On 1 February 2011, Edmonds published a story on her own website, adding details of events she described as taking place in April 2001. The account is of another translator's description of meetings with an Iranian informant months before 9/11, and FBI agents' reaction to it:

:Bin Laden’s group is planning a massive terrorist attack in the United States. The order has been issued. They are targeting major cities, big metropolitan cities; they think four or five cities; New York City, Chicago, Washington DC, and San Francisco; possibly Los Angeles or Las Vegas. They will use airplanes to carry out the attacks. They said that some of the individuals involved in carrying this out are already in the United States. They are here in the U.S., living among us, and I believe some in US government already know about all of this.

It was believed the agents reported this information internally at the FBI, but it is unclear that it ever went beyond that, in fact, both the agents remarked, and the translator told Edmonds, that the intelligence was not specific enough to take action upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2011/02/01/the-fbi-%E2%80%9Ckamikaze-pilots%E2%80%9D-case/ |title=boilingfrog.com, a site founded and published by Sibel Edmonds |publisher=Boilingfrogspost.com |date=1 February 2011 |accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Classified Woman'' ==
In 2012, she published an autobiography called ''Classified Woman – The Sibel Edmonds Story: A Memoir''. Reviewing the book for [[The American Conservative]], [[Philip Giraldi]] said that some details of the book could be challenged due to passage of time. However, he felt the central thesis of government incompetence and corruption was correct.{{r|ac1}}

== NewsBud ==
Sibel Edmonds, along with others, formed [[NewsBud]],&lt;ref name="NewsBud"&gt;{{cite web|title=NewsBud - Where Media Integrity Matters|url=http://www.newsbud.com/about-us/|website=NewsBud|publisher=NewsBud|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a nonpartisan journalism team supported by [[Kickstarter]] donations (setting a new fund raising records for news media, $150,000 each for the 1st &amp; 2nd of 4 phases) by a growing community seeking alternative online news, investigative reports, analysis, original stories, video-podcasts, editorials, and discussion forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NEWSBUD- Where Media Integrity Matters: Join Our Campaign for a 100% People Funded Media |url=http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2016/01/17/newsbud-where-media-integrity-matters-join-our-campaign-for-a-100-people-funded-media/|accessdate=9 December 2016|publisher=Boiling Frogs Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sibel Edmonds's primarily solo Boiling Frogs Post featuring articles and videos is being merged and absorbed into NewsBud - so BFP content is becoming NewsBud content and NewsBud content occasionally appears as a BFP heading or website.&lt;ref name="About Boiling Frogs Post"/&gt;

==Background==
Clement was born to a farmer family in Aaby parish (''Aaby Sogn i Kjer Herred'') in the district of [[Vendsyssel]] in [[North Jutland County|North Jutland]].&lt;ref name="Paludan-Müller1853"&gt;{{cite book|author=Caspar Paludan-Müller|title=Grevens Feide, skildret efter trykte og utrykte Kilder|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89NAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA253|accessdate=6 July 2013|year=1853|publisher=Reitzel|language=Danish|pages=253–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a merchant in [[Aalborg]] and later captain and vice admiral in the navy of King [[Christian II of Denmark]]. In 1523, Christian II was sent into exile and his uncle, [[Frederick I of Denmark]] had taken over the throne. In 1525, Clement mutinied and became a privateer.&lt;ref name="Hammerich1854"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederik Hammerich|title=Danmark under adelsvælden.

==Count's Feud==
{{Main|Count's Feud}}
Clement later allied himself to [[Christopher of Oldenburg]]. At Count Christoffer's instruction, he instigated the peasants of Vendsyssel and North Jutland to rise up against the nobles. On 16 October 1534 the peasant army of Clement, re-enforced with professional soldiers from Count Christoffer, met the army of the Jutland nobility, that had been sent to crush the revolt. The Battle of Svenstrup (''Slaget ved Svenstrup'') resulted in the defeat of the nobility army. For a couple of months the revolting peasants controlled a major part of northern Jutland. They  expelled the noblemen and burned down many of their manor houses. However, in the long run the peasant army was too poorly armed and too undisciplined. King [[Christian III of Denmark]] made a [[separate peace]] with Count Christoffer and his general [[Johan Rantzau]] was freed to fight the peasant revolt. 

In December 1534, the army of Johan Rantzau defeated the peasant army which had retreated to Aalborg and strengthened the defenses of the city. After a hard battle, Rantzau's army overcame the defenses, sacked the city and killed as many as 2,000 people. Clement managed to escape, but was betrayed and captured by his enemies. He was kept in prison until the end of the civil war and was then executed by [[Breaking wheel|breaking on the wheel]] in [[Viborg, Denmark]].&lt;ref name="Litteraturselskab1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Society for Danish Language and Literature]]|title=Danske domme 1375-1662: de private domssamlinger|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8AVbAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=6 July 2013|year=1979|publisher=Det Danske Sprog- og Litteraturselskab|language=Danish|isbn=978-87-87504-76-8|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Folkekalendar for Danmark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=StwxAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=6 July 2013|year=1868|publisher=C.

==Evaluation==
Later historians and fiction writers have admired Clement as a revolutionary figure and a champion for the rights of the common man. Also as a local North Jutland hero he is admired and a statue was erected there in 1931. The depth of his social or ideological engagement is unprovable but as the last active, and perhaps most influential, peasant rebel in Danish history he might be viewed a Danish parallel of [[Wat Tyler]] in [[England]], [[Thomas Müntzer]] in [[Germany]] and [[Yemelyan Pugachev]] in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaos.dk/genealogi/clement/default.htm ''Bondeoprøret i 1534'' (Introduktion til Clement)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tanaquil Le Clercq''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ɛ||k|ˈ|l|ɛər}} {{Respell|lek|LAIR}}; October 2, 1929 &amp;ndash; December 31, 2000) was a French ballet dancer and principal dancer with the [[New York City Ballet]]. Her dancing career ended abruptly when she was stricken with [[polio]] in [[Copenhagen]] during the company's European tour in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900654,00.html?iid=chix-sphere |title=Le Clercq contracts polio in Copenhagen |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=14 February 1969 |issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually regaining most of the use of her arms and torso, she remained paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of her life.

==Biography==
Le Clercq was the daughter of Jacques Le Clercq, a French intellectual, as well as French teacher at Queens College in the 1950s and his American wife, Edith (née Whittemore); she studied ballet with [[Mikhail Mordkin]] before auditioning for the [[School of American Ballet]] in 1941, where she won a scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-ballet.com/leclercq.php |title=Profile of Tanaquil Le Clercq |work=Ballet Encyclopedia |accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Le Clercq was fifteen years old, famed choreographer [[George Balanchine]] asked her to perform with him in a dance he choreographed for a polio charity benefit. In an eerie portent of things to come (Le Clercq would contract polio at twenty-seven and never recover mobility in her legs), he played a character named Polio, and Le Clercq was his victim who became paralyzed and fell to the floor. Then, children tossed dimes at her character, prompting her to get up and dance again.

Le Clercq was considered Balanchine's first ballerina: she was trained in his style from childhood and she was one of his most important muses, together with dancers like Maria Tallchief and, later on, Suzanne Farrell. During Le Clercq's tenure with the company, Balanchine, [[Jerome Robbins]], and [[Merce Cunningham]] all created roles for her. 

Years later, after being stricken with polio, she reemerged as a dance teacher and as one student recalled, "used her hands and arms as legs and feet."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thefreelibrary.com/LIVING+WITH+AIDS%3A+SIX+DANCERS+SHARE+THEIR+STORIES.-a067832282 ''Dance Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Clercq's life and career are profiled in the 2013 documentary film, ''Afternoon of a Faun: Tanaquil Le Clercq''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/472885/Afternoon-of-a-Faun-Tanaquil-Le-Clercq/overview |title=Afternoon of a Faun: Tanaquil Le Clercq (2013) |first=Stephen |last=Holden |authorlink=Stephen Holden |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
Tanaquil Le Clercq was the fourth and last wife (1952–1969) of [[George Balanchine]], the pioneer of American ballet. He obtained a quick divorce from her to woo [[Suzanne Farrell]] (who refused Balanchine's wedding proposal and went on to marry another Balanchine dancer, Paul Mejia). 

Le Clercq died of pneumonia in New York Hospital at the age of 71.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/01/nyregion/tanaquil-le-clercq-71-ballerina-who-dazzled-dance-world.html |title=Tanaquil Le Clercq, 71, Ballerina Who Dazzled Dance World |first=Anna |last=Kisselgoff |authorlink=Anna Kisselgoff |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In high school, she chose arts subjects, but just two years before her matric year she changed to the sciences. She managed to overhaul the backlog of work, developing an enduring love for chemistry as she worked. She received her Cambridge Overseas School Certificate in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sefala |first1=Ntshephe |title=The Presidency Republic of South Africa |url=http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/national-orders/recipient/tebello-nyokong-1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nyokong came from a poor background. She had to wear second-hand clothes and was barefoot. As a young girl she was sent to live with her grandparents in the mountains of Lesotho. She learnt about science by observing the wildlife whilst she worked as an eight-year-old&lt;ref name=nature/&gt; child caring for sheep.&lt;ref name=news/&gt; Nyokong says that she would spend one day at school and then one day with the sheep as someone had to care for them.&lt;ref name=seasvid&gt;[http://21icons.com/seasons/ Video interview with Tebello Nyokong], 21 icons, Retrieved 9 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Nyokong says that one of her childhood ambitions was to own her own pair of shoes.&lt;ref name=news&gt;[http://www.news24.com/Archives/City-Press/Behind-the-Icon-Tebello-Nyokong-The-compassionate-scientist-20150429 Behind the Icon – Tebello Nyokong: The compassionate scientist], 10 May 2014, News24, Retrieved 9 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; When she started school she was steered away from science as she was told that it was too hard. It was only with two years to go that she changed direction and with perseverance completed the science course.&lt;ref name=nature&gt;[http://blogs.nature.com/soapboxscience/2014/10/13/distinguished-south-african-professor-tebello-nyokong-on-science-education-and-innovation Distinguished South African Professor Tebello Nyokong on science, education and innovation], Scrapbook science, Nature, 13 October 2014, Retrieved 9 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Nyokong earned her bachelor's degree in both chemistry and biology from the [[University of Lesotho]] in 1977. She went on to earn her master's in chemistry from [[McMaster University]] in [[Ontario, Canada]]. In 1987, she received her Ph.D in chemistry from the [[University of Western Ontario]].&lt;ref name=Rhodes&gt;{{cite web|title=Prof Tebello Nyokong|url=https://www.ru.ac.za/nanotechnology/staffstudents/staff/profnyokong/|website=Rhodes University|accessdate=November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After earning her PhD, she received a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright fellowship]] to continue her post-doctoral studies at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=Presidency/&gt;

==Career==
After finishing her Fulbright fellowship in the United States, Nyokong returned to Lesotho, briefly as it turned out, to take a position at the University of Lesotho. In 1992, she took a position as a lecturer at Rhodes University. The National Research Foundation gave her a high rating and helped Nyokong obtain a research laboratory at the university.&lt;ref name=Presidency/&gt; Soon, she moved from lecturer to professor, and then distinguished professor.&lt;ref name=Presidency/&gt; She is known for her research in [[nanotechnology]], as well as her work on photo-dynamic therapy.  Her pioneering research in the latter is paving the way for a safer cancer detection and treatment, without the debilitating side effects of chemotherapy.&lt;ref name=AAS/&gt;

Nyokong published an open letter that she wrote nominally aimed at her 18-year-old self&lt;ref name=nature/&gt; (who would have been working hard to complete a three-year science course in just two years). The letter reassured her younger self to have courage as her family may not realise the opportunities ahead. It finishes with "You believe you can be a wife and a mother and still be a bread winner and contribute to society. And you will."&lt;ref name=sourceok&gt;[https://scienceclubforgirls.wordpress.com/2011/03/08/tebello-nyokongs-letter-to-her-young-self/ Tebello Nyokong’s Letter to her 18-year-old Self], tebello Nyokong, Science Club for Girls, 2011, Retrieved 9 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 she was a professor at [[Rhodes University]] in [[Grahamstown]]. She was the subject for a photographic portrait for [[Adrian Steirn]]'s "21 icons".&lt;ref name=season2&gt;[http://21icons.com/seasons/ Promise of Freedom], 21 icons, Retrieved 9 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; which imagined her returned to her childhood role as a [[shepherd]] but now the shepherd is an adult and she is wearing her chemist's white coat.

'''Women in the Marshall Islands''' are women who live in or are from the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]], an [[island country]] that  is politically a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]] in [[Associated state|free association]] with the [[United States]]. Alternative appellations for these women are '''Marshallese women''', '''Marshall Islander women''', '''Marshalls women''', and '''women in Rālik-Ratak''' (literally women "facing toward the windward" [i.e. ''facing sunrise''] and "facing toward the leeward" [i.e. ''facing sunset'']).&lt;ref name=Carucci&gt;{{cite web|last=Carucci|first=Laurence Marshall|title=Marshall Islands|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arts and crafts ==
Marshallese women are known to create "finely-woven ''[[pandanus]]''" and art made from coconut fiber.&lt;ref name=Carucci/&gt;

== Social status ==
The society of the Marshall Islands primarily has a social structure that is [[matrilineal]]. This means that women are own "a great deal of power" because they predominate in making decisions "behind-the-scenes" even though men are seen as the "public performers".&lt;ref name=Carucci/&gt;

In the past, Marshall islander women who belong to the upper class are commonly distinguished by wearing "intricate tattoos", and were spoken to using "restricted speech genres" and "speaking styles". At present, modern-day women in the Marshall Islands may wear "American-style dress modified it to local norms" where the emerging elite may wear "costly dress and personal adornment".&lt;ref name=Carucci/&gt;

== Social welfare==
There are social welfare programs for women, particularly in urban areas, that had been supported by the [[United States]], by religious groups and by other nations belonging to the [[Pacific Rim]] region since the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Carucci/&gt;
