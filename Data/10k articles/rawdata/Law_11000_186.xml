"'''A Taste of Freedom'''" is the fifth&lt;!-- Please do not change. Production order, not airing order, is used here. --&gt; episode in the [[Futurama (season 4)|fourth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[Futurama]]''. It first aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on December 22, 2002. The episode was directed by James Purdum and written by Eric Horsted. The plot centers on [[Zoidberg]]'s experience with the concept of freedom on Earth.

==Plot==
The crew celebrates Freedom Day, a day where one can do anything they want, regardless of the consequences.  [[Dr. Zoidberg]] seems passionate about the holiday, as he loves the idea of freedom, something he did not have on his home planet [[Decapod 10]]. At the big Freedom Day celebration in Washington, D.C., Earth President [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon's head]] unveils the Earth flag "Old Freebie" to celebrate the spirit of the holiday but the flag is eaten by Zoidberg. Zoidberg feels this is an expression of his freedom on Freedom Day; however, the rest of the crowd sees him as a traitor. Zoidberg is chased around town and takes cover in his planet's embassy.

Zoidberg is put on trial and the crew hires lawyer Old Man Waterfall to represent him. Zoidberg is found guilty and sentenced to death when he refuses to apologize publicly. After Earth's army storms the Decapodian embassy to seize Zoidberg, the Decapodian ambassador to Earth summons the Decapodian military to retaliate. The Decapodian army easily defeats Earth's defense forces and Earth is enslaved by the crustacean extraterrestrials.

Later, [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]], [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]], [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]], [[Zapp Brannigan]], and [[Kif Kroker|Kif]], deciding the time has come to fight back, steal a [[heat-seeking missile]] from a museum exhibit and launch it toward the Decopodians’ newly constructed Mobile Oppression Palace. However, the palace is "[[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]]", like the Decapodians themselves, and the palace continues its destructive rampage. It eventually crushes Old Man Waterfall for standing in its way, whom Zoidberg respected for defending him when no one else would. Zoidberg then lights a flag on fire. This shocks and angers the other citizens, but Zoidberg explains that he does so in order to preserve the freedom that the flag represents and throws it toward the Mobile Oppression Palace, attracting the missile and thus destroying the palace. Zoidberg is declared a hero and is honored by Nixon at a ceremony, where he unveils a new Earth flag, out of which Zoidberg is allowed to take a bite.  Zoidberg concludes that Earth, not Decapod 10, is now his true home planet.

==Reception==
''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s Zack Handlen gave the episode a B+, saying: "There’s a fundamental shallowness to “A Taste Of Freedom” which is at once useful for the comedy (because delving into the issues never distracts from the jokes), and disappointing in the story. The episode takes the most predictable stance on its premise--eating the flag is not something you should be arrested for--and then doesn’t offer much variation outside of a series of escalating incidents. That makes for a diverting half hour that occasionally stabs at legitimate criticism, but one that’s ultimately more forgettable than its various absurdities would suggest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Handlen |first=Zack|title=''Futurama'': "A Taste Of Freedom"/"Bender Should Not Be Allowed On Television"|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/futurama-taste-freedombender-should-not-be-allowed-221359|publisher=''[[The A.V.

{{Constitutional history of Canada}}

'''Amendments to the Constitution of Canada''' are [[Constitutional amendment|changes]] to the [[Constitution of Canada]].

== History ==
{{main|Constitutional history of Canada}}

Before 1982, modifying the Constitution of Canada primarily meant amending the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act, 1867]]. Unlike most constitutions, however, this Act had no amending formula: instead changes were enacted through Acts of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (or "Imperial Parliament") called the [[British North America Acts]].

Other Commonwealth countries had taken over the authority for constitutional amendment after the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], but at the time, Canada decided to allow the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] to "temporarily" retain the power. With the [[Constitution Act 1982]], Canada took over the authority to amend its own constitution, achieving full sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/politics-government/proclamation-constitution-act-1982/Pages/proclamation-constitution-act-1982.aspx  |title=Proclamation of the Constitution Act, 1982 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=May 5, 2014 |website=Canada.ca |publisher=Government of Canada |access-date=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;  |date=March 17, 2009 |title=A statute worth 75 cheers |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/a-statute-worth-75-cheers/article1329730/ |newspaper=Globe and Mail |location=Toronto |access-date=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/2017/canada-is-celebrating-150-years-of-what-exactly-1.3883315 |title=Canada is celebrating 150 years of… what, exactly? |last=Couture |first=Christa |date=January 1, 2017 |website=CBC |publisher=CBC |access-date=February 10, 2017 |quote=... the Constitution Act itself cleaned up a bit of unfinished business from the Statute of Westminster in 1931, in which Britain granted each of the Dominions full legal autonomy if they chose to accept it. All but one Dominion — that would be us, Canada — chose to accept every resolution. Our leaders couldn't decide on how to amend the Constitution, so that power stayed with Britain until 1982.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1931 and 1982, the federal government, on behalf of the [[House of Commons of Canada]] and the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]], would issue an address to the British government requesting an amendment. The request would include a resolution containing the desired amendments. These in turn, were always passed by the British Parliament, with little or no debate.

== Amendment formula ==

As part of the [[patriation]] of the Constitution in 1982 an amending formula was adopted in sections 38 to 49 of the [[Constitution Act, 1982]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-16.html#h-56|title=Part V - Procedure for Amending Constitution of Canada, Constitution Act, 1982|publisher = Department of Justice, Canada|accessdate = 8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most amendments can be passed only if identical resolutions are adopted by the House of Commons, the Senate and two thirds or more of the provincial legislative assemblies representing at least 50 percent of the national population. This formula, which is outlined in section 38 of the Constitution Act, 1982, is officially referred to as the "general amendment procedure" and is known colloquially as the "7+50 formula".

Once the procedure for the adoption of the amendment is followed successfully, the amendment is formalized as a proclamation of the Governor General in Council. Officially, therefore, the Constitution is amended by Proclamation, and the issue of the Proclamation requires prior approval by resolutions of the House of Commons, the Senate, and the necessary number of provincial legislative assemblies.

The following matters are reserved to the s. 38 procedure, by virtue of s. 42:

{{Quote|
:(a) the principle of proportionate representation of the provinces in the House of Commons prescribed by the Constitution of Canada;
:(b) the powers of the Senate and the method of selecting Senators;
:(c) the number of members by which a province is entitled to be represented in the Senate and the residence qualifications of Senators;
:(d) subject to paragraph 41(d), the Supreme Court of Canada;
:(e) the extension of existing provinces into the territories; and
:(f) the establishment of new provinces.
}}

If a constitutional amendment affects only one province, however, only the assent of Parliament and of that province's legislature is required. Seven of the eleven amendments passed so far have been of this nature, four being passed by and for [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], one for [[New Brunswick]], one for [[Prince Edward Island]], and one for [[Quebec]].  This formula is contained in section 43 of the Constitution Act, 1982.

There are some parts of the Constitution that can be modified only with the unanimous consent of ''all'' the provinces plus the two Houses of Parliament. This formula is contained in section 41 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and is known as the "unanimity formula". It is reserved for the following matters:

{{Quote|
:(a) the office of the Queen, the Governor General and the Lieutenant Governor of a province;
:(b) the right of a province to a number of members in the House of Commons not less than the number of Senators by which the province is entitled to be represented at the time the ''Constitution Act, 1982'' came into force;
:(c) subject to section 43, the use of the English or the French language;
:(d) the composition of the Supreme Court of Canada; and
:(e) changing the amendment procedure itself.

No specific mention is made in the procedure for amendments affecting what falls within the federal/provincial distribution of powers. Therefore, they can be dealt with generally under s. 38, or with respect to specific provinces under s. 43. However, a s. 38 amendment in that regard will not apply to a province that has passed a resolution of dissent from it, and s. 40 states that a s. 38 amendment that transfers provincial jurisdiction over an education or cultural matter to Parliament must be accompanied by reasonable compensation by Canada to the provinces.

==Supreme Court of Canada in the amending formula==

There has been a debate among legal scholars as to whether the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] is entrenched in the Constitution of Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada was not created by the constitution, rather the power to create a "Court of General Appeal for Canada" was granted to Parliament by s. 101 of the British North America Act, 1867.  Parliament proceeded to create the Supreme Court of Canada under the authority of s. 101 in 1875 by passing the [[Supreme Court Act]], which was an ordinary piece of legislation with no constitutional significance at the time.

The Supreme Court of Canada was mentioned for the first time in a constitutional document by the Constitution Act, 1982. The Supreme Court is referred to twice.  First, s. 41 lists several amendments to the Constitution of Canada requiring unanimous consent. S. 41(d) includes the "composition of the Supreme Court of Canada" in this list.  Second, s. 42(1) lists several amendments to the Constitution of Canada requiring the general amendment procedure. S. 42(1)(d) includes "subject to s. 41(d), the Supreme Court of Canada" in this list. Sections 41 and 42 of the Constitution Act, 1982, thus appear to include the Supreme Court of Canada in the Constitution of Canada.  However, this conclusion is questionable because the "Constitution of Canada" is expressly defined in s. 52(2) as a set of thirty instruments that does not include the Supreme Court Act. Some scholars, including Peter Hogg, have suggested that the references to the Supreme Court of Canada in sections 41 and 42 are ineffective.  They argue that these references are "anticipatory" and will become effective only if Parliament adds the Supreme Court Act to the list in s. 52(2). Other scholars, including Professor Cheffins, have argued that the Supreme Court Act is implied as entrenched into s. 52(2) because of sections 41 and 42.  S. 52(2) uses the words "includes ..." to introduce the list of thirty instruments, suggesting that the provision does not contain an exhaustive list. The Supreme Court itself has confirmed in [[New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia (Speaker of the House of Assembly)]], [1993] 1 S.C.R. 319 that s. 52(2) is not exhaustive, but has not yet ruled on whether the Supreme Court Act is included in the Constitution of Canada.

This issue has implications for judicial selection in Canada. S. 4(2) of the Supreme Court Act specifies that the Governor in Council (federal cabinet) has the power to appoint judges to the Supreme Court. Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] has announced that a new reformed selection process will be developed.  If the new process  binds the federal government, it will necessarily involve an amendment to s. 4(2) of the Supreme Court Act. If the Act is "constitutionalized," this would require a constitutional amendment under the general amendment procedure, a significant hurdle requiring provincial cooperation.  If the Act is not constitutionalized, Parliament can simply amend the legislation by a majority vote.

This issue arose again in connection with Private Member's Bill C-232, passed by the House of Commons in March 2010. The Bill would have amended the Supreme Court Act to require all future appointees to the court to be able to understand both French and English without the assistance of an interpreter.  If the Supreme Court Act is considered part of the Constitution, this change would require a constitutional amendment. Bill C-323 died on the table when Parliament was dissolved for the May election.

In [[Reference re Supreme Court Act, ss. 5 and 6]] 2014 SCC 21, a majority of the Supreme Court rule that clauses concerning the appointment of Justices from Quebec are entrenched.&lt;ref&gt;http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/13544/index.do&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debate ==
{{See also|Constitutional debate in Canada}}
Amending the Canadian Constitution is a topic of great debate in Canada. There seems to be general agreement among provincial governments that some parts of the Constitution need to be amended to deal with long-standing demands from many provinces.  There are demands by western provinces for a greater share of power at the federal level, and demands from Quebec for greater protection for its status as a "[[distinct society]]".  Quebec, in particular, has not formally agreed to the Constitution Act, 1982, although this does not have affect on the legal applicability of the Act.

Nevertheless, agreement on details of amendments has been elusive. Further complicating attempts to amend the Constitution is the complexity of the procedure for doing so, which in most cases requires approval from both the federal parliament and two-thirds of the provincial governments representing at least 50 per cent of the population, and in some cases require the approval of the federal government and all ten provincial governments.

The 1987 [[Meech Lake Accord]], a package of constitutional amendments, intended to address Quebec's objections to the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', failed in 1990 when it was not ratified by all ten provincial governments. The last attempt at a comprehensive package of constitutional amendments was the Charlottetown Accord, which arose out of the failure of the Meech Lake Accord. The [[Charlottetown Accord]] was defeated in a national referendum in 1992.

There have been several relatively minor amendments to the Constitution since it was patriated in 1982 including amendments dealing with provincial schooling in Newfoundland and Quebec and the changing of the name of Newfoundland to Newfoundland and Labrador (see below).

Although the amending formula has not been formally altered, the Canadian government under Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]] after the [[1995 Quebec referendum]] recognized regional [[veto]]es over proposed amendments, held by the provinces of [[Ontario]], Quebec and [[British Columbia]], and by the regions the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]] ([[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]]) and the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic]] (New Brunswick, [[Nova Scotia]], Newfoundland and Labrador, and Prince Edward Island).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gomery Inquiry: Jean Chrétien: a former PM testifies|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/groupaction/chretien_statement.html#top|publisher=CBC News|date = 8 February 2005|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-1982 amendments to the Constitution==
In addition to the amendment listed in the following table, many important changes were made to the constitutional structure of Canada by adding entire extra documents to the Constitution. These include orders that added provinces to Canada, such as the ''British Columbia Terms of Union'' and documents that altered the structure of the government of Canada, such as the ''Parliament of Canada Act, 1875''. For a complete list of documents added to the Constitution before 1982, see [[List of Canadian constitutional documents]].

==Post-1982 amendments to the Constitution==

Amending the Constitution has been a topic of much debate in contemporary Canada, and the two most comprehensive attempts to revise the document have both been defeated. There have, however, been eleven minor amendments to the Constitution since it was patriated in 1982. Most of these amendments have been limited in scope, dealing only with matters affecting specific provinces.

== Post-1982 failed attempts ==
{{main|Unsuccessful attempts to amend the Canadian Constitution}}
Attempts to enact major amendments:
*The [[Meech Lake Accord]].
*The [[Charlottetown Accord]].

==Temporary alternative to amendment==
Various provisions of the Canadian Constitution are subject to the ''notwithstanding clause'', which is [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].  This section authorizes governments to temporarily override the rights and freedoms in sections 2 and 7–15 for up to five years, subject to renewal. The Canadian federal government has never invoked it, although provincial governments have done so.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Scoffield, "Ottawa rules out invoking notwithstanding clause to stop migrant ships," Canadian Press, 13 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The notwithstanding clause was invoked routinely, between 1982 and 1985, by the province of [[Quebec]] (which did not support the enactment of the Charter but is subject to it nonetheless). The provinces of [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Alberta]] have also invoked the notwithstanding clause, to end a [[strike action|strike]] and to protect an exclusively [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|heterosexual definition]] of marriage,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/ab/laws/sta/m-5/20060217/whole.html Marriage Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113082005/http://www.canlii.org/ab/laws/sta/m-5/20060217/whole.html |date=13 January 2007 }}, R.S.A. 2000, c. M-5. Accessed URL on 10 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. (Note that Alberta's use of the notwithstanding clause is of no force or effect, since the definition of marriage is federal not provincial jurisdiction.)&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, Peter. "Notwithstanding what?" ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'', 21 January 2006, pg. C.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The territory of Yukon also passed legislation once that invoked the notwithstanding clause, but the legislation was never proclaimed in force.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Parliament, Parliamentary Information and Research Service, [http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/bp194-e.htm#Section The Notwithstanding Clause of the Charter], prepared by David Johansen, 1989, as revised May 2005.

{{Conflict of laws}}
In [[law]], an '''anchor defendant''' is a person who is made a defendant to a claim for the primary purpose of vesting jurisdiction to hear the claim in a certain court.  Usually the purpose of the anchor defendant is to allow claims to be brought in a certain court against another defendant (not the anchor defendant) over whom the relevant court would not otherwise have jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rogerson |first=Pippa |date=July 2013 |title=Collier's Conflict of Laws |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jjC3OQecgYUC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=anchor+defendant&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4_CLh8ZA0C&amp;sig=4OihyZ759pgf17TCYyH6CQ_039Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DOJ-VL_SHIivyASH44CIBw&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=anchor%20defendant&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=150 |isbn=9780521735056 |accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, use of anchor defendants is often a variation of [[forum shopping]].

The reference to an [[anchor]] is metaphorical; "anchoring" the proceedings to the relevant jurisdiction where they might otherwise naturally drift to another court.

==Basis==

The use of anchor defendants as a litigation strategy relies upon two basic principles common to most legal systems.  The first is that where a cause of action involves claims against multiple parties, it is convenient for all of those claims to be tried together to avoid the risk of inconsistent results.  The second is that courts in different jurisdictions should seek to avoid holding concurrent trials relating to the same claims (this is usually referred to as the doctrine of ''[[lis alibi pendens]]''), both the avoid the risk of inconsistent results and to avoid defendants having to respond to the same claims in different courts.

Accordingly, whilst there is a general recognition that courts should only entertain actions against defendants over whom they have jurisdiction, most systems will expand this to include another defendant who is a necessary and property to a claim where there is proper jurisdiction over one of the defendants.

For example, with the [[European Union]], Article 6 of the [[Jurisdiction under the Brussels I Regulation|Brussels I Regulation]] provides:

:"A person domiciled in a Contracting State may also be sued:

::(1) where he is one of a number of defendants, in the courts for the place where any one of them is domiciled;"

Similarly, the English [[Civil Procedure Rules]] provide in RSC Order 11 (found in Schedule 1):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1998/3132/schedule/1/made|title=The Civil Procedure Rules 1998|publisher=HMSO|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Rule 1  (1)  Provided that the claim form does not contain any claim mentioned in Order 75, r.2 (1) and is not a claim form to which paragraph (2) of this rule applies, a claim form may be served out of the jurisdiction with the permission of the Court if—
::...
::(c) the claim is brought against a person duly served within or out of the jurisdiction and a person out of the jurisdiction is a necessary or proper party thereto;"

==Limitations==

As with other types of forum shopping, the courts in various jurisdictions have taken steps to try and prevent the abuse of court system by using anchor defendants.  However, attempts to do so will always be limited by the powerful countervailing considerations of the need to ensure that all connected actions should be tried by a single court where ever possible.

For example, in ''Sharples v Eason &amp; Son''&lt;ref&gt;[1911] 2 IR 436&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that leave ought not be given to serve a claim outside of the jurisdiction if the sole, or predominant, reason for beginning the action a party duly served within the jurisdiction is  to enable an application to be made to serve parties outside of the jurisdiction.

Furthermore, even where the use of an anchor defendant successfully vests the jurisdiction to try an action against a foreign defendant in a court, the court will often have a general residual discretion to stay the proceedings on the basis that it is not the most appropriate court to try the case (the doctrine of ''[[forum non conveniens]]'').

In ''AK Investment CJSC v Kyrgyz Mobil Tel Ltd''&lt;ref&gt;[2011] UKPC 7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence Collins, Baron Collins of Mapesbury|Lord Collins]] gave the opinion of the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] summarising the applicable principles of [[common law]]&lt;ref&gt;The case was an appeal from Isle of Man, but the principles enunciated by Lord Collins were based upon English legal precedent.&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to determining whether it was proper to grant leave to serve proceedings on a foreign defendant who the court would not otherwise have jurisdiction over after the action had been originally commenced against an anchor defendant:
# The fact that the motive in suing an anchor defendant is merely to bring another defendant into the jurisdiction to be joined to the action does not necessarily mean the court will exercise its discretion against giving permission to serve proceedings on a foreign defendant outside of the jurisdiction.  But it is a factor which the court will consider in the exercise of its discretion.
# However, there must be a serious issue to be tried against the anchor defendant.  If there is no serious issue to be tried, or if the claim against the anchor defendant is bound to fail, then the foreign defendant should not be joined.
# If there is a serious issue to be tried, is the connection between the anchor defendant and the foreign defendant such that the foreign defendant truly a "necessary and proper party" to that action?  The Court should look to determine if there is "one investigation" against both parties, or whether the claims against both defendants are "closely bound up" with each other.

Lord Collins subsequently endorsed his own decision on those points in ''[[Nilon Limited v Royal Westminster Investments S.A.]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[2015] UKPC 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

In ''[[Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Co v Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Services Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1983] Ch 258&lt;/ref&gt; the [[liquidator (law)|liquidators]] of an insolvent company incorporated in Liberia wished to bring claims against the company directors in England for breach of duty and negligence.  However, none of the directors were resident in Britain and none of the actions complained of had occurred within the United Kingdom.  Accordingly, the liquidators brought a claim against the company's brokers (which was an affiliated company incorporated in England) alleging negligence.  The claimant company then sought to join the former directors claiming they had been negligent in reviewing the advice provided by the brokers, and that the directors were a necessary and proper party to the action.  The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|English Court of Appeal]] held that the only basis for bringing proceedings against the broker was to try and bring the former directors within the jurisdiction of the court, and for this and other reasons&lt;ref&gt;They also held that there was no sustainable cause of action against the directors under Liberian law because the acts complained of had been ratified by the members of the plaintiff company.&lt;/ref&gt; they refused to grant leave to serve the writ outside of the jurisdiction on the directors.

A '''board of supervisors''' is a [[govern]]ing [[organization|body]] that oversees the operation of [[county (United States)|county]] government in the [[U.S.|American]] [[states of the United States|states]] of [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Iowa]], [[Mississippi]], [[Virginia]], and [[Wisconsin]], as well as 16 counties in [[New York (state)|New York]]. There are equivalent agencies in other states. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bos.lacounty.gov/|title=County of Los Angeles Board of Supervisors &gt; Home|author=|date=|website=bos.lacounty.gov|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to a [[city council]], a board of supervisors has legislative, executive, and quasi-judicial powers. The important difference is that a county is an administrative division of a state, whereas a city is a municipal corporation; thus, counties implement and, as necessary, refine the local application of state law and public policy, while cities produce and implement their own local laws and public policy (subject to the overriding authority of state law). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counties.org/general-information/county-structure-0|title=County Structure &amp; Powers - California State Association of Counties|author=|date=|website=counties.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative powers==

Boards may pass and repeal laws, generally called ''[[Local ordinance|ordinance]]s''. Depending on the state, and the subject matter of the law, these laws may apply to the entire county or to only [[unincorporated area]]s not within the jurisdiction of a city. The board is also responsible for approving the county budget. County governments may collect state taxes and, in some states, they may also levy taxes, such as property or sales tax.

In some states, including [[Michigan]], and in some [[New York (state)|New York]] counties until recently, county governing boards were composed of township (Michigan) or town (New York) "supervisors". These are the chief elected officials of each civil township. Boards of Supervisors were originally composed of the various town/township supervisors from across the county. This system gave every township one vote on the county board regardless of its population, resulting in less populous townships having influence in decision-making that was disproportionate to their populations.

Both Michigan and New York changed how they elected county boards by dividing counties into single member districts, drawn so that each district has more or less the same sized population or with each township's vote weighted by population, under order from the [[Warren Court]] (see ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]''). In Michigan, the new board model was implemented in 1968. The name "Board of Supervisors" was changed to "Board of Commissioners" in 1970 to avoid confusion with township government (where the term "Supervisor" was still used). In New York, the new boards were called "county legislatures" (and their members, "county legislators"), but not every county has adopted this system. Those that retained the old boards of supervisors after the 1960s assigned each member a proportional vote based on the population represented.

==Executive powers==

Boards oversee county departments. Generally, this is done under the aegis of a [[county administrator]] or [[county executive]]. The power of the administrator or executive to act independently depends on the county charter. The administrator or executive usually has the authority over the day-to-day operations of the county's departments. Many boards independently appoint department heads, while other boards delegate that authority to the administrator or executive. Some department heads, like the [[sheriff]] or [[district attorney]], may be elected separately by the electorate; however, the board still controls these departments' budgets.

In the [[San Francisco|City and County of San Francisco]], a [[consolidated city-county]] government, the Board of Supervisors does dual duty as a county board of control and a city council, and the [[mayor]] is simultaneously city head of state and county executive.

==Quasi-judicial powers==

In some states, the board is the final arbiter of decisions made by commissions underneath a board. This often involves [[land use planning]] issues.

==Other states==

In some states the equivalent body to a Board of Supervisors is called the ''[[county council]]'' or ''[[county commission]]''; for [[Louisiana]] [[municipal parish|parishes]], the equivalent body is a ''[[Police Jury]]''. In [[New Jersey]], the equivalent is the [[Board of chosen freeholders]], while in [[Kentucky]] the equivalent is called the [[Fiscal Court]]. In [[Nebraska]], some counties are governed by a board of supervisors while others are governed by a county commission. In New York, counties are governed by a county legislature, a board of representatives, or a board of supervisors.

In [[Pennsylvania]], "Board of Supervisors" is the name of the body governing [[township]]s of the second class that have not adopted a home rule charter.  By default, a Pennsylvania township board of supervisors consists of three members, elected at large in odd-numbered years to staggered six-year terms.  Voters of a township of the second class can vote to expand the board to five members. In contrast, townships of the first class elect a Board of Commissioners, one member from each ward, ranging from 7 to 15 in number.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}
{{Civil procedure (United States)}}
A '''cause of action''', in [[law]], is a set of facts sufficient to justify a right to sue to  obtain money, property, or the enforcement of a right against another party. The term also refers to the legal theory upon which a plaintiff brings suit (such as [[breach of contract]], [[battery (tort)|battery]], or [[false imprisonment]]). The legal document which carries a claim is often called a 'statement of claim' in English law, or a '[[complaint]]' in U.S. federal practice and in many U.S. states. It can be any communication notifying the party to whom it is addressed of an alleged fault which resulted in damages, often expressed in amount of money the receiving party should pay/reimburse.&lt;ref&gt;See generally [[John Baker (legal historian)|Sir John Baker]], ''An Introduction to English Legal History'' (4th ed); [[S. F. C. Milsom]], ''Historical Foundations of the Common'' Law (2nd ed).&lt;/ref&gt;

To pursue a cause of action, a [[plaintiff]] [[pleading|pleads]] or [[allegation|alleges]] facts in a [[complaint]], the pleading that initiates a lawsuit. A cause of action generally encompasses both the [[legal theory]] (the legal wrong the plaintiff claims to have suffered) and the [[Legal remedy|remedy]] (the relief a court is asked to grant).  Often the facts or circumstances that entitle a person to seek judicial relief may create multiple causes of action. Although it is fairly straightforward to file a Statement of Claim in most jurisdictions, if it is not done properly, then the filing party may lose his case due to simple technicalities.

There are a number of specific causes of action, including: [[contract]]-based actions; statutory causes of action; [[torts]] such as [[assault]], [[battery (tort)|battery]], [[invasion of privacy]], [[fraud]], [[defamation|slander]], [[negligence]], [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]]; and suits in [[Equity (law)|equity]] such as [[unjust enrichment]] and [[quantum meruit]].

The points a plaintiff must prove to win a given type of case are called the "elements" of that cause of action.  For example, for a claim of [[negligence]], the elements are: the (existence of a) [[duty]], breach (of that duty), proximate cause (by that breach), and [[damages]].  If a complaint does not allege facts sufficient to support every element of a claim, the court, upon motion by the opposing party, may dismiss the complaint for [[failure to state a claim]] for which relief can be granted.

The defendant to a cause of action must file an "Answer" to the complaint in which the ''claims'' can be admitted or denied (including denial on the basis of insufficient information in the complaint to form a response). The answer may also contain counterclaims in which the "Counterclaim Plaintiff" states its own causes of action. Finally, the answer may contain [[affirmative defense]]s. Most defenses must be raised at the first possible opportunity either in the answer or by motion or are deemed waived. A few defenses, in particular a court's lack of subject matter [[jurisdiction]], need not be pleaded and may be raised at any time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3208">The '''Central Election Commission of Abkhazia''' is the body responsible for conducting national [[elections in Abkhazia|elections]] and overseeing local elections in [[Abkhazia]]. It was first formed on 20 July 1991.&lt;ref name=rrc294&gt;{{cite news|title=DECREE ISSUED BY THE PRESIDIUM OF THE SUPREME COUNCIL OF THE ABKHAZ ASSR on Establishment of the Central Electoral Commission on election of the Deputies to the Supreme Council of the Abkhaz ASSR|url=http://www.rrc.ge/law/dadg_1991_07_20_e.htm?lawid=294&amp;lng_3=en|accessdate=21 July 2012|date=20 July 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Chairmen==
The first chairman of the Central Election Commission was [[Viacheslav Tsugba]],&lt;ref name=rrc294/&gt; who held the post until he became Prime Minister in 1999.

On 11 October 2004, [[Sergei Smyr]] resigned during the height of the crisis following the [[Abkhazian presidential election, 2004|Presidential election]] earlier that month.&lt;ref name=uzel64962&gt;{{cite news|title=Абхазия: выборы президента|url=http://www.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/64962/|accessdate=21 July 2012|newspaper=[[Caucasian Knot]]|date=February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 December, the newly formed Central Election Commission elected former Justice Minister [[Batal Tabagua]] as its chairman.&lt;ref name=uzel66397&gt;{{cite news|last=Kuchuberia|first=Anzhela|title=Председателем ЦИК Абхазии избран экс-министр юстиции Батал Табагуа|url=http://www.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/66397/|accessdate=21 July 2012|newspaper=[[Caucasian Knot]]|date=12 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Tabagua was not re-appointed to the Central Election Commission, and on 23 December, former State Privatisation Committee Chairman [[Tamaz Gogia]] was elected his successor during the first meeting of the CEC in its new composition.&lt;ref name="inform5093"&gt;{{cite news|title=ТАМАЗ ГОГИЯ ИЗБРАН ПРЕДСЕДАТЕЛЕМ ЦЕНТРАЛЬНОЙ ИЗБИРАТЕЛЬНОЙ КОМИССИИ|url=http://abkhazinform.com/item/5093-tamaz-gogiya-izbran-predsedatelem-tsentralnoj-izbiratelnoj-komissii|accessdate=27 February 2017|agency=[[Abkhazia Inform]]|date=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2434">{{UStaxation}}
In the [[tax law]] of the [[United States]] the '''claim of right doctrine''' causes a taxpayer to [[Recognition (tax)|recognize income]] if they receive the income even though they do not have a fixed right to the income.  For the income to qualify as being received there must be a receipt of cash or property that ordinarily constitutes income rather than loans or gifts or deposits that are returnable, the taxpayer needs unlimited control on the use or disposition of the funds, and the taxpayer must hold and treat the income as its own.  This [[Case law|law is largely created by the courts]], but some aspects have been codified into the [[Internal Revenue Code]].

==History==
The claim of right doctrine, as it dictates whether the "right" to the income subject to a contingency that may take the income away is taxable in the US, originated in the ''[[North American Oil Consolidated v. Burnet]]'' decision.&lt;ref&gt;286 U.S. 417 (1932).&lt;/ref&gt;  This court decision said that a taxpayer's income subject to a contingency that may take away the income but a taxpayer who receives it "without restriction as to its disposition...has received income" which the taxpayer "is required to [report]", even though the taxpayer "may still be adjudged liable to restore" it. In other words, A taxpayer must report the receipt of income for the time that she or he has control over it.

If a taxpayer ends up having to return the income recognized under the claim of right doctrine, then the taxpayer may receive a tax credit for that amount according to the Internal Revenue Code, if such a credit is a greater tax benefit than a deduction.&lt;ref&gt;26 USCA 1341. See also, Eugene Van Cleave case.&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts limited the claim of right doctrine and will not allow the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] to make the taxpayer recognize income if there are significant restrictions on the taxpayer's disposition of the income.&lt;ref&gt;Smarthealth case&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15429">The '''Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act''' ('''CALEA'''), also known as the "Digital Telephony Act," is a [[United States]] [[wiretapping]] law passed in 1994, during the [[presidency of Bill Clinton]] (Pub. L. No. 103-414, 108 Stat. 4279, codified at 47 USC 1001-1010).

CALEA's purpose is to enhance the ability of [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] to conduct [[lawful interception]] of communication by requiring that telecommunications carriers and manufacturers of telecommunications equipment modify and design their equipment, facilities, and services to ensure that they have built-in capabilities for [[targeted surveillance]], allowing federal agencies to selectively wiretap any telephone traffic; it has since been extended to cover broadband Internet and VoIP traffic. Some government agencies argue that it covers [[mass surveillance]] of communications rather than just tapping specific lines and that not all CALEA-based access requires a warrant.

The original reason for adopting CALEA was the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s worry that increasing use of digital telephone exchange switches would make tapping phones at the phone company's [[Telephone exchange|central office]] harder and slower to execute, or in some cases impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trope|first1=Konrad L.|title=US Government Eavesdropping on Electronic Communications: Where Are We Going?|journal=SciTech Lawyer|date=2014|volume=10|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the original requirement to add CALEA-compliant interfaces required phone companies to modify or replace hardware and software in their systems, [[U.S. Congress]] included funding for a limited time period to cover such network upgrades.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}  CALEA was passed into law on October 25, 1994 and came into force on January 1, 1995.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In the years since CALEA was passed it has been greatly expanded to include all [[Voice over IP|VoIP]] and [[Internet access|broadband Internet]] traffic. From 2004 to 2007 there was a 62 percent growth in the number of wiretaps performed under CALEA{{snd}} and more than 3,000 percent growth in interception of Internet data such as email.&lt;ref name="point-click-eavesdrop"&gt;{{cite web |last=Singel |first=Ryan |url=https://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2007/08/wiretap? |title=Point, Click ...

By 2007, the FBI had spent $39 million on its [[Digital Collection System Network]] (DCSNet) system, which collects, stores, indexes, and analyzes communications data.&lt;ref name="point-click-eavesdrop"/&gt;
{{wikisource}}

== Provisions of CALEA ==
In its own words, the purpose of CALEA is:

:''To amend title 18, [[United States Code]], to make clear a telecommunications carrier's duty to cooperate in the interception of communications for Law Enforcement purposes, and for other purposes.''

The U.S. Congress passed the CALEA to aid law enforcement in its effort to conduct criminal investigations requiring wiretapping of digital telephone networks. The Act obliges telecommunications companies to make it possible for law enforcement agencies to [[Wiretapping|tap]] any phone conversations carried out over its networks, as well as making [[call detail record]]s available. The act stipulates that it must not be possible for a person to detect that his or her conversation is being monitored by the respective government agency.

Common carriers, facilities-based broadband Internet access providers, and providers of interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service{{snd}} all three types of entities are defined to be “telecommunications carriers” and must meet the requirements of CALEA.

The CALEA Implementation Unit at the FBI has clarified that intercepted information is supposed to be sent to Law Enforcement concurrently with its capture.

On March 10, 2004, the [[United States Department of Justice]], FBI and [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] filed a "Joint Petition for Expedited Rulemaking"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.askcalea.com/docs/20040310.calea.jper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in which they requested certain steps to accelerate CALEA compliance, and to extend the provisions of CALEA to include the ability to perform surveillance of all communications that travel over the Internet{{snd}} such as Internet traffic and VoIP.

As a result, the FCC adopted a "First Report and Order" concluding that CALEA applies to facilities-based broadband Internet access providers and providers of interconnected (with the [[PSTN|public switched telephone network]]) Voice-over-Internet-Protocol (VoIP) services.

In May 2006, the FCC adopted a "Second Report and Order", which  clarified and affirmed the First Order:

* The CALEA compliance deadline remains May 14, 2007.
* Carriers are permitted to meet their CALEA obligations through the services of "Trusted Third Parties (TTP)"{{snd}} that is, they can hire outside companies, which meet security requirements outlined in CALEA, to perform all of the required functions.
* Carriers are responsible for CALEA development and implementation costs.

== Technical implementation ==
For Voice and Text messaging, CALEA software in the central office enables wiretap.  If a call comes in for a number on the target phone a "conference bridge" is created and the second leg is sent to law enforcement at the place of their choosing. By law this must be outside of phone company.  This prevents law enforcement from being inside the phone company and possibly illegally tapping other phones.

Text messages are also sent to law enforcement.

There are two levels of CALEA wiretapping:

* The first level only allows that the "meta data" about a call be sent.  That is the parties to the call, the time of the call and for cell phones, the cell tower being used by the target phone.  For text message, the same information is sent but the content is not sent.  This level is called "Trap and Trace". 
* The second level of CALEA wiretap, when permitted, actually sends the voice and content of text messages. This is called "Title III" wiretap.
 
USA telecommunications providers must install new hardware or software, as well as modify old equipment, so that it doesn't interfere with the ability of a law enforcement agency (LEA) to perform real-time surveillance of any telephone or Internet traffic.  Modern voice switches now have this capability built in, yet Internet equipment almost always requires some kind of intelligent [[deep packet inspection]] probe to get the job done.  In both cases, the intercept function must single out a subscriber named in a warrant for intercept and then immediately send some (headers-only) or all (full content) of the intercepted data to an LEA.  The LEA will then process this data with analysis software that is specialized towards criminal investigations.

All traditional voice switches on the U.S. market today have the CALEA intercept feature built in.  The IP-based "soft switches" typically do not contain a built-in CALEA intercept feature; and other IP-transport elements (routers, switches, access multiplexers) almost always delegate the CALEA function to elements dedicated to inspecting and intercepting traffic.  In such cases, hardware taps or switch/router mirror-ports are employed to deliver copies of all of a network's data to dedicated IP probes.

Probes can either send directly to the LEA according to the industry standard delivery formats (c.f. ATIS T1.IAS, T1.678v2, et al.); or they can deliver to an intermediate element called a mediation device, where the mediation device does the formatting and communication of the data to the LEA.  A probe that can send the correctly formatted data to the LEA is called a "self-contained" probe.

In order to be compliant, IP-based service providers (broadband, cable, VoIP) must choose either a self-contained probe, or a "dumb" probe component plus a mediation device, or they must implement the delivery of correctly formatted data for a named subscriber on their own.

== Controversy ==
The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) warns that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/pages/calea-faq#19 |title=FAQ on the CALEA Expansion by the FCC &amp;#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* CALEA makes US software and hardware less attractive for worldwide consumers.
* CALEA is a reason to move [[research and development]] out from the US.
* CALEA-free devices will probably be available in the [[gray market]].

Journalist [[Marc Zwillinger]] from the ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' explains his concerns with proposed revisions to the CALEA that would require Internet companies to provide law enforcement with a method of gaining access to communication on their networks.&lt;ref name="Zwillinger"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/should-law-enforcement-have-the-ability-to-access-encrypted-communications-1429499474|title=Should Law Enforcement Have the Ability to Access Encrypted Communications?|last=Zwillinger|first=Marc|date=April 20, 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=May 30, 2018|language=|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zwillinger warns this new mandatory access could create a dangerous situation for multinational companies not being able to refuse demands from foreign governments.&lt;ref name="Zwillinger"/&gt;  These governments could “threaten financial sanctions, asset seizures, imprisonment of employees and prohibition against a company’s services in their countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/should-law-enforcement-have-the-ability-to-access-encrypted-communications-1429499474|title=Should Law Enforcement Have the Ability to Access Encrypted Communications?|last=Zwillinger|first=Marc|date=April 20, 2018|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=May 30, 2018|language=|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the creation of this new mechanism could create an easier way for hackers to gain access to the U.S. government’s key.&lt;ref name="Zwillinger"/&gt;  Moreover, the [[Communications in the United States|U.S. telephone network]] and the [[Global Internet usage|global internet]] differ in that U.S. telephone carriers “weren’t responsible for decrypting communications unless the carrier possessed the decryption key. In fact, CALEA’s legislative history is full of assurances that the Department of Justice and FBI had no intention to require providers to decrypt communications for which they did not have the key.”&lt;ref name="Zwillinger"/&gt;  Therefore, a revision of the CALEA cannot necessarily secure companies from providing data on their devices during criminal investigations to foreign governments.

== Lawsuits ==
Originally CALEA only granted the ability to wiretap digital telephone networks, but in 2004, the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ),  [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives]] (ATF), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), and [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) filed a joint petition with the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to expand their powers to include the ability to monitor [[VoIP]] and [[broadband]] Internet communications{{snd}} so that they could monitor Web traffic as well as phone calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-06-56A1.pdf|title=FCC's Second Report and Order |publisher=FCC |date= |accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] has filed several lawsuits to prevent the FCC from granting these expanded [[mass surveillance|domestic surveillance]] capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/CALEA/1999/ |title=EFF CALEA Archives 1999 |publisher=W2.eff.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/CALEA/2000/ |title=EFF CALEA Archives 2000 |publisher=W2.eff.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FCC’s First Report and Order, issued in September 2005, ruled that providers of broadband Internet access and interconnected VoIP services are regulable as “telecommunications carriers” under CALEA. That order was affirmed and further clarified by the Second Report and Order, dated May 2006. On May 5, 2006, a group of higher education and library organizations led by the [[American Council on Education]] (ACE) challenged that ruling, arguing that the FCC’s interpretation of CALEA was unconstitutional under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. However, on June 9, 2006, the D.C. Circuit Court disagreed and summarily denied the petition.&lt;ref&gt;American Council on Education vs. FCC, [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]], [http://www.baller.com/pdfs/ACE.pdf Decision 05-1404(pdf)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907032500/http://www.baller.com/pdfs/ACE.pdf |date=2012-09-07 }} June 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2450">'''Concerned Foreign Service Officers''' ('''CFSO''') is a group of current and former [[United States Foreign Service|Foreign Service]] and Civil Service employees of the [[U.S. Department of State]], cofounded by [[William Savich]] and [[Daniel M. Hirsch]], created to investigate, document and expose alleged misuse of the security clearance process by the State Department's [[Diplomatic Security Service]] (DSS).

CFSO's concern is the possibility that the clearance process can be used to circumvent Federal personnel regulations, to bypass equal employment opportunity laws and to punish dissenters and whistle blowers within the agency.

The group investigates and documents allegations of improper and coercive interview techniques, fraudulent statements in investigative reports, suppression or destruction of evidence, improper seizure of personal property, misapplication of security regulations and similar allegations in relation to DSS cases.

The group considers that such acts would threaten the [[national security of the United States]] by reducing the reliability and integrity of DSS operations and by inhibiting the expression of dissenting views within the Foreign Service. Concerned Foreign Service Officers is allied with the [[NSWBC|National Security Whistle Blowers Coalition]].

The '''Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons''' is a 1954 United Nations [[multilateral treaty]] that aims to protect [[statelessness|stateless]] individuals.

==Surrounding events==
The [[United Nations Charter]] and [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] were approved on 10 December 1948. Of significance, the Declaration at Article 15 affirms that:
# Everyone has the right to a [[nationality]].
# No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality.

The [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]] was promulgated on 28 July 1951. Despite an original intention, it did not include any content about the status of [[stateless persons]] and there was no [[Treaty#Protocols|protocol]] regarding measures to effect the reduction of [[statelessness]].

On 26 April 1954, [[ECOSOC]] adopted a Resolution to convene a [[Plenipotentiary|Conference of Plenipotentiaries]] to "regulate and improve the status of stateless persons by an international agreement".

The ensuing Conference adopted the Convention on 28 September 1954.

The [[Treaty|Convention]] entered into force on 6 June 1960.

==Key substantive content of convention==

;Article 1: The [[Treaty|Convention]] applies to stateless persons under the protection of the [[UNHCR]] but not to those under the protection of other UN Agencies. It does not apply to persons with rights and obligations acknowledged by their country of residence as indistinguishable from those attached to the possession of that country's nationality. It does not apply to [[war criminals]] or to the perpetrators of [[crimes against humanity]] or [[crimes against peace|against peace]]. It does not apply to those who have demonstrated themselves to have been enemies of international peace and co-operation.

;Article 7: Contracting States shall accord to stateless persons the same treatment as is accorded to aliens generally.

;Article 8: No "exceptional measures" to be taken against stateless persons in a Contracting State because of their former nationality.

;Article 9: Provisional measures affecting stateless persons may be taken in time of war or grave emergency where national security is at issue.

;Article 10: Forcible removal of a stateless person from territory of a Contracting State due to Second World War to count as residence in that territory.

;Article 11: Admonition of States to show sympathy to stateless seaman regularly engaged on ships of that State's flag

;Article 12: Personal status (e.g. marital status) of a stateless person to be governed by the law of his/her domicile ahead of the [[lex loci|law of his/her residence]].

;Article 13: Rights to property to be no less than accorded to [[Alien (law)|aliens]] generally.

;Article 14: Intellectual property rights to be no less than accorded by a Contracting State to its own nationals.

;Article 15: [[Right of association]] to be no less than accorded by each Contracting State to [[Alien (law)|aliens]] generally.

;Article 16: [[Stateless persons]] not to be discriminated against in providing "security for costs and eventual penalty", or otherwise by courts in Contracting States.

;Articles 17–19: Stateless persons to be treated at least as favourably as aliens generally with regard to participation in wage-earning employment.

;Articles 20–23: Stateless persons to be treated no less favourably than nationals with respect to [[rationing]], housing, [[public education]], and public relief.

;Article 24: Extension of Articles 20–23 to [[labour law|labour legislation]] and [[social security]].

;Article 27: Upon request, Contracting States shall issue travel and identity documents to stateless persons within their territory.

;Article 29: No discrimination against stateless persons in fiscal charges.

;Article 30: [[Stateless persons]] to be permitted to transfer their assets to the place of their resettlement.

;Article 31: [[Stateless persons]] not to be expelled except on grounds of national security or public order.

;Article 34: Interpretation disputes between State parties to be finally referable to the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ)

;Remaining Clauses: Territorial application; federal clause; signature, ratification and entry into force.

==State parties==
As of September 2016, the United Nations, the depositary of the convention, lists 91 parties to the Convention; two states ([[Holy See]] and [[Colombia]]) have signed the convention, but have not ratified it.&lt;ref name="UN Treaty Status"/&gt; The 91 parties are: [[Albania]], [[Algeria]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Argentina]], [[Armenia]], [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Barbados]], [[Belgium]], [[Belize]], [[Benin]], [[Bolivia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Botswana]], [[Brazil]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Chad]], [[Chile]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Ecuador]], [[El Salvador]], [[Fiji]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Gambia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Guatemala]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Haiti]], [[Honduras]], [[Hungary]], [[Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Kiribati]], [[Latvia]], [[Lesotho]], [[Liberia]], [[Libya]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Malawi]], [[Mali]], [[Mexico]], [[Montenegro]], [[Mozambique]], [[Netherlands]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], [[Norway]], [[Panama]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Philippines]], [[Portugal]], [[South Korea]], [[Moldova]], [[Romania]], [[Rwanda]], [[Senegal]], [[Serbia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Swaziland]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Turkey]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Tunisia]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uganda]], [[Ukraine]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Uruguay]], [[Zambia]], and [[Zimbabwe]].

[[Haiti]] is the most recent to accede to the Convention, doing so on 27 September 2018.&lt;ref name="UN Treaty Status"/&gt;

[[Madagascar]] denounced its accession made in 1962, effective 2 April 1966. The United Kingdom extended the convention to [[British Hong Kong]], and [[China]] has declared that the convention continues to apply to [[Hong Kong]] post-1997.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="66629">{{Copyright-RU}}
The '''Copyright law of the Soviet Union''' went through several major revisions during its existence. The first Socialist [[copyright]] law was passed in 1925. Three years later, it was superseded by a second version that remained in force for more than three decades, until it was replaced in 1961.

Throughout these various revisions of the law, some characteristics remained constant. Copyright was automatic in the [[USSR]]: a work was copyrighted from its creation, and registration was not needed.&lt;ref name="Levitsky28"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;/ref&gt; Only creative works expressed in some objective form were subject to copyright.&lt;ref name="Levitsky100ff"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;100ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newcity51ff"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;53ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The duration of copyright was much shorter than customary in the West. Copyright was, from the beginning, limited to works of Soviet citizens and to works by foreign authors that were first published in the USSR (or, if unpublished, existed in objective form on the territory of the Soviet Union).&lt;ref name="Levitsky50ff"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;50ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newcity60ff"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;60ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The economic rights of authors were limited by a long list of uses that did not constitute copyright infringements,&lt;ref name="Levitsky15"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt; and mandatory official royalty rates limited the income of authors. Soviet copyright law also granted the freedom of translation (until 1973): any work could be freely translated and then published without the original author's consent.

The accession of the USSR to the [[Universal Copyright Convention]], which became effective on May 27, 1973, was a major turning point. Copyright was extended to also cover works of foreign authors that were first published abroad after that date, and the freedom of translation had to be abolished. For the first time in history, Russia (in the form of the Soviet Union) had joined a multilateral, international copyright treaty, ending the country's self-imposed isolation (but also its independence) in copyright matters.

During [[Perestroika]], the law and the administrative procedures were changed piece by piece, relaxing the governmental control over authors' exercises of their copyright. The official royalty rates were dropped, and the state monopoly on foreign trade on copyrights was abolished. Authors for the first time could legally negotiate publication contracts with foreign publishers themselves. A new, profoundly revised Soviet copyright law was passed in 1991, but the Soviet Union was dissolved before it could enter in force.

== Revolutionary Copyright ==
The old Tsarist Copyright law of 1911 was not immediately invalidated after the [[October Revolution]]. The old law, with its [[copyright term]] of 50 years after the author's death and its possibility of transferring copyrights in their entirety from an author to a publisher, continued to be valid initially.&lt;ref name="Levitsky31"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newcity18"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elst73"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;73.&lt;/ref&gt; But the [[nationalization]]s in all areas of the economy soon considerably restricted the avenues through which an author could publish her or his work, even if her or his copyright remained initially untouched.&lt;ref name="Levitsky31"/&gt; All publishing activities were placed under the supervision of the State Publishing house by a decree of May 21, 1919. On July 29, 1919, the government declared a state monopoly on unpublished works of deceased authors; and on April 20, 1920, ''all'' books (including those in private possession) were nationalized, except those in public libraries. Theatres and film studios as well as the photographic industry were nationalized in August 1919. Private publishing houses were eventually liquidated as well.&lt;ref name="Levitsky33"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt; The right to translate foreign publications into [[Russian language|Russian]] was also monopolized by the government.&lt;ref name="Newcity20"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalizations of works===
In the interest of public education, the new Communist regime wanted to widely (and inexpensively) disseminate classic Russian literature to the masses. Toward this end, a decree was issued December 29, 1917  (Gregorian date) enabling the [[People's Commissariat]] for Education to nationalize works of deceased authors (including composers).&lt;ref name="Levitsky31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elst72"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;72.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 14, 1918, the works of 58 deceased authors were nationalized&lt;ref name="Levitsky31a"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;31. (RSFSR Law 201)&lt;/ref&gt; -- including, among others, [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]], [[Nikolai Chernyshevsky|Chernyshevsky]], [[Fyodor|Dostoyevsky]], [[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]], [[Alexander Herzen|Herzen]], [[Mikhail Lermontov|Lermontov]], [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]], [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], and [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgenev]].&lt;ref name="Elst72a"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;72. The mentioned authors' works were later covered again by the decree of January 18, 1923, by which the state monopoly on publishing them was made perpetual.&lt;/ref&gt; The government established a state monopoly on the publication of these authors' works for a period of five years, which was later extended by again five years. A second nationalization decree of November 26, 1918 extended the powers of the People's Commissariat for Education to nationalize also works of living authors.&lt;ref name="Levitsky31"/&gt; The decree granted the commissariat a perpetual monopoly to the publication rights of such nationalized works;&lt;ref name="Elst72"/&gt; living authors were to receive royalties based on the standard remuneration schedules established by the government, while the royalties on works by deceased authors went to the state.&lt;ref name="Levitsky31"/&gt; Based upon this second decree, a number of nationalizations occurred in the following years. On August 16, 1919, the works of the seventeen composers [[Anton Arensky|Arensky]], [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Mily Balakirev|Balakirev]], [[César Cui|Cui]], [[Vasily Kalinnikov|Kalinnikov]], [[Herman Augustovich Laroche|Laroche]], [[Anatoly Lyadov|Lyadov]], [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Anton Rubinstein|Rubinstein]], [[Liverij Antonovich Sakketi|Sakketi]], [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]], [[Alexander Serov|Serov]], [[Stepan Smolensky|Smolensky]], [[Vladimir Stasov|Stasov]], and [[Sergei Taneyev|Taneyev]] were nationalized.&lt;ref name="Levitsky32"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newcity19"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 18, 1923, the works of [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and 46 further authors were nationalized.&lt;ref name="Newcity19"/&gt; A third decree on May 14, 1925 nationalized the works of [[Georgi Plekhanov]] and also the Russian translations of the works of [[Upton Sinclair]], and finally, on June 28, 1927, the [[Marx-Engels Institute]] was granted a publication monopoly on the works of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]].&lt;ref name="Levitsky32"/&gt;

===Legislative changes===
Legislative decrees invalidated some&amp;mdash;but not all&amp;mdash;of the provisions of the Tsarist copyright law. In the context of the general abolition of legal and testimonial succession rights,&lt;ref name="Elst73"/&gt; the nationalization decree of November 26, 1918 also reduced the copyright term from the 50 years ''p.m.a.'' ({{lang-la|post mortem auctoris}}&amp;mdash;"after the author's death") of the Tsarist copyright law to the lifetime of the author.&lt;ref name="Levitsky32a"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;32. Levitsky also writes that during the six months following an author's death, his works could not be published at all, not even if they had been nationalized.&lt;/ref&gt; Assignments of copyrights in their entirety were invalidated by a decree of October 10, 1919. Under the Tsarist law, an author could transfer his copyrights to a publisher; under Soviet doctrine, this was not possible: an author could only grant a publisher a time-limited publication right, a principle that would hold throughout the existence of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Newcity20"/&gt; Furthermore, the contracts to be used were standardized and a fixed schedule for royalties was defined by a decree of October 25, 1918.&lt;ref name="Levitsky31"/&gt;

Copyright in itself was upheld, though: works that had not been nationalized could only be used or reproduced with the consent of the author.&lt;ref name="Elst73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newcity20"/&gt; Nationalized works could only be published with the consent of the People's Commissariat for Education, to which a publisher also had to pay a fee according to a fixed schedule.&lt;ref name="Levitsky32"/&gt;

== Copyright Act of 1925 ==

The legal situation concerning copyright in the Soviet Union in the early 1920s was confused. The Tsarist copyright law was still partially in effect, but its status was unclear. There were a number of decrees affecting copyright, but there was no unified legal treatment.&lt;ref name="Newcity20"/&gt; The new Civil Law of the [[Russian SFSR]], which became effective on January 1, 1923, did not contain any provisions on copyright either.&lt;ref name="Levitsky33"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newcity20"/&gt; In 1924, the [[Council of People's Commissars]] launched a project to develop a new copyright statute.&lt;ref name="Newcity21"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 30, 1925, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Central Executive Committee]] passed the new Fundamentals of Copyright Law.&lt;ref name="Elst74"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;74.&lt;/ref&gt; These "Fundamentals" (''{{lang|ru-Latn|Osnovy}}''&amp;mdash;{{lang|ru|Основы}}) were to serve as a model law for the laws of the individual [[republics of the Soviet Union]], which all&amp;mdash;with the exception of the [[Ukrainian SSR]]&lt;ref name="Newcity21a"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;21. The [[Ukrainian SSR]] enacted its first own copyright law on February 6, 1929; implementing the [[#1928 Fundamentals|1928 Fundamentals]].&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;passed laws implementing the Fundamentals at the republic level in 1925/26; the RSFSR Copyright Act was passed on October 11, 1926.&lt;ref name="Elst74"/&gt; All these republics' laws did not deviate from the Fundamentals.&lt;ref name="Newcity29a"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;29. In the case of discrepancies between any union-wide legislation and the laws of a republic, the federal law prevailed. This basic principle was expressed clearly for the first time in the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union]] in 1936, in article 20 of the so-called [[1936 Soviet Constitution|Stalin Constitution]]. In the [[1977 Soviet Constitution|Constitution of 1977]], article 74 covered this principle.&lt;/ref&gt; Only in the [[Azerbaijan SSR]] were the copyright provisions included in the Civil Code of the republic; in all other SSRs, the act was a separate ad-hoc piece of legislation.&lt;ref name="Newcity21"/&gt;

The 1925 Copyright Act provided for a general copyright term of 25 years since the first publication of a work. If an author died before that period had expired, the heirs were granted the right to receive royalties according to the schedules established by the government for the shorter of the remaining part of the 25-year term or during 15 years. If a work was published after the author's death, this right was limited to a term of 15 years from the posthumous publication.&lt;ref name="Levitsky34"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;34.&lt;/ref&gt; For some specific classes of works, such as encyclopedias, photographs, or also [[Choreography|choreographic]] and [[Pantomime|pantomimic]] works the copyright term was shorter than the general 25-year period.&lt;ref name="Newcity21b"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;21. Neither Elst, nor Levitsky, nor Newcity give any indication of how long these reduced terms in the 1925 copyright act were.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The law recognized the exclusive right of the author to publish, reproduce, and distribute his work,&lt;ref name="Elst74a"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;74. "Publication" did not imply "distribution" in Soviet law. A work was "published" if it was presented to a wider public; this might include a theater performance, a public reading, or a radio broadcast. This is a much broader concept of "publication" than was and is customary in Western countries; in the [[United States]], for example, a work is "[[publication|published]]" if ''copies'' of the work are distributed to the general public in a tangible medium.&lt;/ref&gt; and also his right to remuneration, i.e., the right to receive royalties for uses of a work.&lt;ref name="Levitsky34"/&gt; The law included provisions enabling authors to transfer copyrights for a limited time (five years) to a publisher by contract; only publishing contracts with state, trade union, or [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party]] publishing houses could be of unlimited duration.&lt;ref name="Newcity21"/&gt; The contract had to specify precisely the intended use of the work, the number of copies printed, the royalties to be paid, etc.&lt;ref name="Elst75"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;75.&lt;/ref&gt; The allowed range of the amount of royalties was prescribed in governmental remuneration schedules.&lt;ref name="Levitsky142ff"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;142ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The copyrights of an author were limited by a large array of free uses allowed without the author's consent.&lt;ref name="Elst75"/&gt; Amongst these free uses was the "freedom of translation", which had already existed in the old Tsarist copyright law. A translation of any work could be done without the author's consent, and the translator was granted a separate and independent copyright on the translation.&lt;ref name="Newcity22"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;22.&lt;/ref&gt; This provision was, already before Soviet times, motivated by the desire to ensure an economically viable way to translate works between the many national languages of the country.&lt;ref name="Newcity22"/&gt; A decree on March 16, 1927 clarified that radio broadcasts of theater or concert performances were also admissible free uses.&lt;ref name="Newcity22"/&gt; [[Compulsory license]]s also existed in the 1925 Copyright Act. Public performances of a published work, for instance, were allowed without the author's consent, but were subject to the payment of the standard royalties.&lt;ref name="Elst75"/&gt; The government also reserved the right to forcibly nationalize any work.&lt;ref name="Levitsky34"/&gt;

Another characteristic that Soviet copyright law inherited from the Tsarist law was that copyright was automatic: copyright began with the creation of the work (not its completion or publication), and was not subject to registration.&lt;ref name="Levitsky28"/&gt; Copyright covered all literary and musical works as well as works of the arts and scientific works&lt;ref name="Levitsky28"/&gt; and also films&lt;ref name="Elst75"/&gt; by Soviet citizens, as well as works by foreign authors that were first published in the Soviet Union or, if unpublished, existed there in some objective form, irrespective of the author's nationality.&lt;ref name="Levitsky50ff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newcity60ff"/&gt; An "objective form" was any form that permitted the reproduction of the work without any involvement of the original author.&lt;ref name="Newcity53"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;53, explaining that an "objective form" not necessarily needed to be permanent or tangible. Any form by which others could perceive and potentially reproduce the work counted as an "objective form", including public recitals, lectures, or radio broadcasts. Compare also the comments on "publication".&lt;/ref&gt; Only creative works were subject to copyright; works of a purely technical nature such as telephone directories, business correspondence, accountants' statements, but also court decisions or decrees, did not fall under copyright.&lt;ref name="Levitsky100"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elst574"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;574.&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet courts interpreted this creativity requirement liberally; requiring only a minimal creative effort. A work created by a minimal [[Paraphrasing of copyrighted material|paraphrase of an existing text]] could already be considered a new work eligible to copyright.&lt;ref name="Levitsky101"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;101, who gives as an example a book on [[tractor]]s that reproduced uncopyrighted plans and only minimally rephrased, equally uncopyrighted technical specifications, yet was considered a copyrightable work.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newcity52"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;52&lt;/ref&gt;

After only three years, new Fundamentals of Copyright Law superseded the 1925 version. The new Fundamentals were passed on May 16, 1928, and again the Union republics implemented them by passing their own compliant copyright acts afterwards.&lt;ref name="Newcity29a"/&gt; The 1928 law was similar to the 1925 one. It maintained the author's exclusive rights to publish, reproduce, distribute, and perform his works, and also his right to derive an income from such uses of his work.&lt;ref name="Levitsky35f"/&gt; It took over from the 1925 law the list of free uses, including the freedom of translation,&lt;ref name="Levitsky36"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newcity74f"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;74f.&lt;/ref&gt; and also the cases involving compulsory licenses. The government reserved the right to nationalize a work without consent of the author.&lt;ref name="Levitsky36"/&gt; In practice, an author's exclusive rights to publish and distribute his works was restricted by the requirement to do so through official channels and by the state monopoly over the printing and publishing industries.&lt;ref name="Levitsky71f"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;71f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The copyright term was changed from 25 years following the first publication of a work to the lifetime of the author plus 15 years (15 years ''p.m.a.'').&lt;ref name="Levitsky36"/&gt; This change was applied retroactively also to works that had already entered the public domain under the old term.&lt;ref name="Elst76"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;76.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the death of an author, copyright passed onto his heirs or other legal successors.&lt;ref name="Levitsky36"/&gt; For certain kinds of works, shorter copyright terms applied. Periodicals, encyclopedias, choreographic works, movies and movie scripts, and collections of photographs were copyrighted for ten years from their first publication.&lt;ref name="Levitsky36"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levitsky92"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;92.&lt;/ref&gt; Individual photographs were copyrighted for five years since their publication.&lt;ref name="Levitsky36"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levitsky92"/&gt; Photographs were only copyrighted if they bore the name of the studio or the photographer, the address, and the year.&lt;ref name="Levitsky107"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual republics of the USSR were free to devise their own rules for standard publication contracts and royalty schedules.&lt;ref name="Levitsky36"/&gt; Royalty collection and payment was centralized through a state agency founded in 1932 and named in 1938 the "[[All-Union Administration for the Protection of Copyrights]]", (VUOAP &amp;ndash; ''{{lang|ru-Latn|Vsesoiuznoe upravlenie po ochrane avtorskich prav}}''; {{lang|ru|Всесоюзное управление по охране авторских прав, ВУОАП}}). The VUOAP was placed under the auspices of the [[USSR Union of Writers|Union of Soviet Writers]] and managed literary works.&lt;ref name="Levitsky39"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar [[collecting society|collecting societies]] existed for other kinds of works, such as compositions, movies, or works of the visual arts.&lt;ref name="Newcity25"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the 1928 Copyright Act, courts did not grant any damage claims by private persons for copyright infringement. The payment of fines to citizens instead of to the state was seen as contrary to communist doctrine. When damages were granted, they were to be paid to the state.&lt;ref name="Levitsky20f"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;20f.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the courts limited damage claims in copyright infringement cases to the sums defined by the existing standard schedules of remuneration issued by the government. If no schedule existed, no damages were awarded at all, even if the works were confirmed to be copyrighted.&lt;ref name="Levitsky21"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Soviet law, from 1925 on until the demise of the Soviet Union (and also beyond in the successor states of the USSR), has always maintained that copyrights existed on a work regardless of its purpose or its value,&lt;ref name="Elst540f"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;540f.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''exercise'' of copyright in the Soviet Union was subject to the rules of [[censorship]] and the literary controls, the press legislation, the laws on printing, publishing, and selling, and Party directives.&lt;ref name="Levitsky11"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, only authors of "socially useful" works could exploit their copyrights; on "useless works" such as Church hymns no economic rights could be enforced; and authors of undesirable works faced administrative, or social, or even penal sanctions.&lt;ref name="Levitsky14"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;14. An example of an administrative sanction was the expulsion of the author from the [[USSR Union of Writers|Union of Soviet Writers]].&lt;/ref&gt; What was "socially useful" was defined in a number of Party decrees (from 1925 to 1963, there were thirty-three such decrees).&lt;ref name="Levitsky266f"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;266f.&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers, film studios, and so on, were expected to refuse to publish works that were considered non-compliant to the currently valid definitions of the goals of artistic activity as defined by these decrees.&lt;ref name="Levitsky14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Loeber24f"&gt;Loeber&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;24f.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the nominally exclusive rights of authors to publication were restricted by the need to go through the official channels and state-controlled publishing houses. As a way to bypass this governmental control for literary works ''[[samizdat]]'' developed: the non-commercial dissemination of a work in chain-letter fashion through carbon-copies produced by readers on their typewriters.&lt;ref name="Elst33_34"&gt;Elst, p.&amp;nbsp;33&amp;ndash;34, who also points out that ''samizdat'' was not fought by the authorities for the means of dissemination it employed but for the ideas it disseminated.&lt;/ref&gt; Many ''samizdat'' works were considered to be "[[anti-Soviet agitation]]" by the authorities and the authors were prosecuted under [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|article 58(10)]] (later articles 70 and 190(1)) of the RSFSR Criminal Code or corresponding provisions of the other republics' penal laws.&lt;ref name="Elst50_51"&gt;Elst, p.&amp;nbsp;50&amp;ndash;51. Article 190(1) was introduced in 1966 in the Criminal Code of the RSFSR, after the trial against [[Andrei Sinyavsky]] and [[Yuli Daniel]], in which the prosecution had found it difficult to prove the intent to do harm that was required by article 70. The new article 190(1) made the "dissemination of known falsehoods that defame the Soviet political and social system" a criminal offense and didn't stipulate any intention at all. Similar provisions existed in the other republics' laws, e.g. articles 62 and 187 of the Criminal Code of the [[Ukrainian SSR]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newcity157"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The copyright law of 1928 remained in effect essentially unchanged for more than thirty years. The numerous copyright-related decrees issued during this time concerned mostly administrative matters, such as the definition of the standard author's contracts for publication or the standard royalty tariffs.&lt;ref name="Levitsky47ff"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;47ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elst77"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;77.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, a decree declared that for a posthumously rehabilitated author, the copyright term of 15 years was to begin to run at the date of his [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitation]], not at the date of his death.&lt;ref name="Elst78"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;78.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1961 Fundamentals ==

In 1961, the copyright law of the Soviet Union was completely restructured. For the first time, copyright law was incorporated into the federal Civil Code and no longer formed a separate piece of legislation. On December 8, 1961, the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] passed the Fundamentals of Civil Legislation, which entered in force on May 1, 1962.&lt;ref name="Newcity29"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Loeber10"&gt;Loeber&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt; The eleven articles of Chapter IV of these Fundamentals covered the copyright law.&lt;ref name="Elst79"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;79.&lt;/ref&gt; The overhaul of the copyright law was to settle doctrinal disputes by clarifying the old law and to adapt the law to the current practice.&lt;ref name="Elst79"/&gt; Again, these new Fundamentals of Civil Legislation formed a statutory framework only (what is called a ''{{lang|fr|loi-cadre}}'' in French, or a ''{{lang|de|Rahmengesetz}}'' in German); the fifteen Union republics then passed their own legislation in conformity with this union-wide framework.&lt;ref name="Newcity29a"/&gt; New republic laws entered in force in all republics in 1964/65; in the [[RSFSR]], the new Russian Civil Code, including the copyright provisions of chapter IV, became effective on June 11, 1964.&lt;ref name="Elst79"/&gt; All these republics' laws were very similar, there were only minor differences.&lt;ref name="Elst79a"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;79. Some differences existed for the copyright terms for photographic works and works of applied arts, the copyright on works made by employees, and the fact that diaries and letters were explicitly copyrighted in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newcity80a"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;80 mentions that the [[Ukrainian SSR]] and the [[Uzbek SSR]] had copyright terms shorter than 15 years ''p.m.a.'' for photographic works and works of applied art in their implementation of the 1961 Fundamentals.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extent of copyright ===
The 1961 Fundamentals recognized two distinct classes of rights an author was granted under copyright, termed "personal rights" and "property rights" in Soviet legal doctrine. Personal rights comprised the right of attribution (i.e., to be named as the author),&lt;ref name="Levitsky80"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;80.&lt;/ref&gt; the right to maintain the integrity of a work,&lt;ref name="Levitsky83f"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;83f.&lt;/ref&gt; and the right to publish, reproduce, and distribute a work.&lt;ref name="Levitsky81"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;81.&lt;/ref&gt; The property rights essentially were the right to derive material benefits&lt;ref name="Levitsky87"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;87.&lt;/ref&gt; if a work was used.&lt;ref name="Levitsky89"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;89.&lt;/ref&gt; The personal rights were no longer declared "exclusive" rights of the author.&lt;ref name="Newcity71"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;71.&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet legal theorists had argued since the 1930s that despite the text of the 1928 Fundamentals, an author actually did not enjoy exclusive publishing rights on his works and could not publish his works himself, but was only entitled to receive remuneration if the official bodies approved the publication of a work.&lt;ref name="Levitsky71f"/&gt;

Copyright was automatic and not subject to registration;&lt;ref name="Levitsky28"/&gt; in fact, a long-ignored registration paragraph of the 1928 law had been abolished already in 1959.&lt;ref name="Levitsky90"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newcity55"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;55, explaining that this registration under the 1928 Fundamentals had not been mandatory, and not a precondition on the existence of copyright in a work.&lt;/ref&gt; Copyright arose with the creation of the work.&lt;ref name="Levitsky90"/&gt; As before, the only requirements for a copyright were that the work was creative and existed in an objective form on the territory of the USSR.&lt;ref name="Newcity53"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levitsky100"/&gt; If a work met these two conditions, it was copyrighted regardless of the nationality of the author.&lt;ref name="Newcity22"/&gt; Works of Soviet authors were copyrighted in all cases, even if they existed only abroad or were first published outside of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Newcity62"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;62.&lt;/ref&gt; The list of copyrightable works in the law was only indicative, but included explicitly for the first time also sound recordings ("mechanical or magnetic recording").&lt;ref name="Levitsky54f"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;54f. Sound recordings were already copyrighted under the 1928 law, but the 1961 law made this explicit for the first time.&lt;/ref&gt; Oral works such as speeches were copyrightable works, although such copyrights were virtually unenforceable in practice and largely nullified anyway by a "free use" provision allowing their free reproduction.&lt;ref name="Levitsky105"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;105.&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural works were also copyrighted, but that copyright extended only to the plans, blueprints, and models, not to the actual building itself.&lt;ref name="Levitsky107"/&gt; Photographs still were subject to the rule from the 1928 Fundamentals that they needed to be marked with the name of the studio, its address, and the year in order to be copyrighted.&lt;ref name="Levitsky107"/&gt; Employees for the first time were granted a copyright on works they created as part of their duties, but their right to remuneration was limited to their salary.&lt;ref name="Levitsky117"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;117.&lt;/ref&gt;{{anchor|PD-Soviet-Civil-Servant}} Legal documents and in general works created by civil servants in their line of duty were not subject to copyright.&lt;ref name="Levitsky122"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fundamentals defined that copyright lasted throughout the life of the author; individual republics of the union were free to define shorter terms.&lt;ref name="Newcity80"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;80.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fundamentals also contained provisions dealing with the inheritance of copyright,&lt;ref name="Levitsky274"&gt;Levitsky, p. 274: Article 105 of the Fundamentals 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed the RSFSR defined in its 1964 Civil Code implementation of the fundamentals a general copyright term of 15 years ''p.m.a.'' The shorter terms for certain classes of works that had been defined by the previous Fundamentals of 1928 were abandoned.&lt;ref name="Newcity80"/&gt; The personal rights of authorship and to the integrity of the work did not pass to the heirs; these rights were perpetually linked to the author and enforced after the authors' death by VUOAP.&lt;ref name="Newcity78"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;78.&lt;/ref&gt; Heirs of an author could inherit copyright; their rights essentially comprised the right to be remunerated for uses of the work. In the RSFSR, the maximum royalties heirs were entitled to had been limited already by two decrees in 1957/58 to 50% of the standard royalty schedule.&lt;ref name="Levitsky58"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;58.&lt;/ref&gt; This limit was in 1961 prescribed on a union-wide basis in article 105 of the Fundamentals.&lt;ref name="Levitsky58"/&gt; Another RSFSR decree from 1962 went even further and reduced the royalties of heirs of authors of non-fictional works to 20% of the standard tariff.&lt;ref name="Levitsky53"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the 1961 Fundamentals, [[Juristic person|legal entities]] such as companies could also hold copyrights. Examples of such corporate copyright ownership included photo studios who held the copyright on their photos, publishers of encyclopedias or periodicals, who held a copyright on the compilation as a whole, film studios, who owned the copyrights on movie scripts and the movies they produced, and select news agencies ([[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]], on January 15, 1935, was granted the copyright on all the information it disseminated.&lt;ref name="Levitsky120"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;120.&lt;/ref&gt; [[RIA Novosti|Novosti]] was later also granted this right.&lt;ref name="Elst581"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;581. Elst also mentions that the [[Central Museum of the Revolution]] at [[Moscow]] on March 6, 1930 was granted the exclusive rights to publish and distribute reproductions of the objects exhibited. The [[Marx-Engels Institute]] also fell into the category of legal entity rights holders.&lt;/ref&gt;). In the case of compilations such as encyclopedias or periodicals, the publishing company owned only a copyright on the work in its entirety; the copyright on the individual contributions that made up the compilation remained with the individual authors.&lt;ref name="Newcity68"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;68.&lt;/ref&gt; Copyrights held by legal entities were defined to be perpetual; if a company was reorganized, its legal successor entity took over the copyrights, and if a company ceased to exist, the copyrights passed to the state.&lt;ref name="Newcity68"/&gt;

=== Limitations of copyright ===
The 1961 Fundamentals, like its predecessor laws, allowed for a wide selection of free uses and compulsory licenses, subject only to the attribution of the original author of a work.&lt;ref name="Newcity109"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;109.&lt;/ref&gt; Free uses of a work allowed anyone to use a published, copyrighted work without the original author's consent and without the payment of royalties, while [[compulsory license]]s were those cases where the use was also allowed without the author's consent, but only if royalties were paid.&lt;ref name="Newcity109"/&gt; The free uses comprised:
*The permission to create new, creatively independent [[derived works]] (article 103(1)). Excepted were only the adaptation of a literary work into a drama or a film and the making of a film from a play, as well as the two inverse cases.&lt;ref name="Newcity109"/&gt;
*The permission to reproduce published scientific, artistic, or literary works as excerpts (or even entirely) in scientific, critical, or educational publications (article 103(2)).&lt;ref name="Newcity109"/&gt;
*The permission to use scientific, artistic, or literary works in news reporting (article 103(3)).&lt;ref name="Newcity110a"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;110, pointing out that this is a free use permission generally also granted in other countries to enable the production of reviews and news stories.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The permission to use scientific, artistic, literary, or oral works (speeches) in film, radio, and on television, provided the original work existed already in a form amenable to such use. (article 103(4)).&lt;ref name="Newcity110b"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;110. This provision did ''not'' allow producing a film from a literary work, for instance: such a use was subject to the author's consent. But e.g. a previous radio broadcast could be freely rebroadcast by any other station, or an opera performance could be broadcast on television.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the free uses, the 1961 Fundamentals also maintained the freedom of translation, but the translator was newly required to maintain the meaning and the integrity of the original work (article 102).&lt;ref name="Levitsky55"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;55.&lt;/ref&gt; The Civil Code of the RSFSR of 1964 contained an additional free use provision in article 493 that allowed the reproduction or other use of a published work for personal purposes.&lt;ref name="Newcity114"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;114.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were four compulsory licenses in the 1961 Fundamentals:
*The performance of published dramatic, musical, and literary works was allowed without the author's consent. Since a performance constituted "publication" under Soviet law, an author's contract was only needed for the first performance of a hitherto unpublished work.&lt;ref name="Newcity115"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;115.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Previously published works could be recorded by any means for the purpose of public reproduction or circulation of the work without the author's consent. (Recordings for the use in film, radio, and on television were already covered by the free use in article 103(4).)&lt;ref name="Newcity115"/&gt;
*A composer could use a published literary work to compose a musical work with lyrics without the consent of the author of the text. When the composition was performed or recorded, the author of the text was entitled to royalties.&lt;ref name="Newcity115"/&gt;
*Artistic or photographic works could be used in industrial articles without the original author's consent (and in this case, even his name needed not be given). This provision was intended for the manufacturing of items such as wallpapers or fabrics; it did not permit industrial mass-copying of a work (such as a sculpture).&lt;ref name="Newcity116"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the government also continued to reserve the right of compulsory purchase of copyrights, but this right was not often exercised. It was employed mostly to prevent "unjustified enrichment" of the heirs of authors of successful works.&lt;ref name="Levitsky121"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newcity116f"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;116f.&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Universal Copyright Convention

The [[Universal Copyright Convention]] (UCC) was developed under the lead of the [[UNESCO]] as an international copyright treaty that offered an alternative to the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]]. The initial version of the UCC was adopted in Geneva on September 6, 1952; it entered in force on September 16, 1955.&lt;ref name="unesco_52"&gt;[[UNESCO]]: ''[http://www.unesco.org/culture/copyright/html_eng/ucc52ms.pdf Universal Copyright Convention adopted in Geneva in 1952: State of ratifications...]''; URL last accessed 2007-01-16.&lt;/ref&gt; A revision of the UCC was adopted in Paris on July 24, 1971 and entered in force on July 10, 1974.&lt;ref name="unesco_71"&gt;UNESCO: ''[http://www.unesco.org/culture/copyright/html_eng/ucc71ms.pdf Universal Copyright Convention as revised at Paris 1971: State of ratifications...]''; URL last accessed 2007-01-16.&lt;/ref&gt; These changes concerned the introduction of special advantages for developing countries and the explicit acknowledgment of an author's exclusive rights to reproduction, performance, and broadcast of a work.&lt;ref name="Elst485"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;485.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ucc_71_IVbis"&gt;Universal Copyright Convention (1971), article IVbis.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UCC was designed to demand less stringent copyright requirements than the Berne Convention with the goal of achieving international copyright recognition for countries that considered the Berne Convention too demanding.&lt;ref name="Lewinski1"&gt;Lewinski,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; The UCC required a minimum general copyright term of 25 years ''p.m.a.'' or, for works where copyright began upon the publication, of 25 years since the first publication.&lt;ref name="ucc_25"&gt;[[Universal Copyright Convention]], article IV.&lt;/ref&gt; Shorter durations were allowed for a few kinds of works.&lt;ref name="ucc_photos"&gt;Universal Copyright Convention, article IV(3).&lt;/ref&gt; The UCC gave signatory countries more leeway than the Berne Convention to keep the idiosyncrasies of their laws (such as requirements for copyright registrations, or a two-term scheme as it was used until 1978 in the [[United States]]). The UCC applied only to works that were not permanently in the public domain in the country where copyright was claimed.&lt;ref name="ucc_VII"&gt;Universal Copyright Convention, article VII. This formulation has the effect that the UCC does not place under copyright foreign works in a country where such foreign works were not copyrighted before that country's accession to the UCC. This is different from the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]], where the copyright status in the ''source'' country of a work is the determining factor.&lt;/ref&gt; The provisions of the Berne Convention supersede those of the UCC in countries that are signatories of both treaties.&lt;ref name="ucc_XVII"&gt;Universal Copyright Convention, article XVII and annex 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Of all the signatory countries of the UCC by 2006, only [[Laos]] was not also a signatory of the Berne Convention.&lt;ref name="Lewinski1"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
{{see also|International copyright relations of Russia}}
On February 27, 1973, the Soviet Union joined the Geneva version of 1952 of the [[Universal Copyright Convention]] (UCC). The UCC became effective in the USSR on May 27, 1973.&lt;ref name="Elst81"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;81&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, the USSR had not participated in any multilateral international copyright treaties; it had only concluded two bilateral contracts with [[Hungary]] (in 1967) and [[Bulgaria]] (in 1971).&lt;ref name="Elst80"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;80.&lt;/ref&gt; The USSR timed its accession to the UCC to occur before the 1971 Paris version of the UCC entered into force.&lt;ref name="Elst82"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;82, footnote 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the Paris version had become effective, accessions to the earlier Geneva version were no longer possible. The USSR would then have been forced to implement the somewhat stronger provisions of the 1971 Paris version, which in particular explicitly recognized an author's exclusive rights to reproduction, performance, and broadcast of a work.&lt;ref name="Elst82"/&gt;

By virtue of the UCC, foreign works first published after May 27, 1973 outside of the USSR became copyrighted in the Soviet Union if
*the author was a national of any other signatory country of the UCC, irrespective of where this publication occurred, or if
*the work was first published in any other UCC country, regardless of the nationality of the author.&lt;ref name="Elst83"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;83. Foreign works first published ''within'' the USSR had always been copyrighted in the USSR. Works of Soviet authors that were first published outside of the USSR also always had been covered by the Soviet copyright law, and if such works were first published in a country that adhered to the UCC or the Berne Convention, they were also copyrighted internationally under these treaties even before the accession of the Soviet Union to the UCC. (See Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;33.)&lt;/ref&gt;
Soviet works first published after this date also became copyrighted in other UCC countries.&lt;ref name="Elst83"/&gt;

On February 21, 1973, six days before the USSR deposited its declaration of accession to the UCC, the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] of the USSR enacted a series of amendments to chapter IV of the 1961 Fundamentals to bring the Soviet copyright law in line with the minimum requirements the UCC imposed. The Union republics adapted their own laws accordingly; the RSFSR as the largest of the republics did so on March 1, 1974.&lt;ref name="Newcity49"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;49.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, the USSR declared its agreement with the use of Soviet copyrighted works in developing countries according to the rules laid down in the 1971 Paris edition of the UCC.&lt;ref name="Loeber10"/&gt;

=== Adaptation of the Soviet law ===
Since the UCC prescribed a minimum copyright term of 25 years, chapter IV of the Fundamentals was changed accordingly. Copyright henceforth ran generally for the lifetime of the author plus 25 years,&lt;ref name="Newcity80"/&gt; only for photographic works and works of applied art, there were shorter terms in some of the republics. In the Georgian SSR, these kinds of works were copyrighted for 20 years since their publication or creation, in the Moldavian and Uzbek SSR, for 15 years, and in Azerbaijan for ten years. In Kazakhstan, photographic works were protected for ten years and collections of photos for 15 years. These reduced terms took advantage of a provision in the UCC that set a minimum term of ten years since publication for these kinds of works.&lt;ref name="Newcity80"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ucc_photos"/&gt; The law of the Russian SSR did not contain any such reduced copyright terms for these kinds of works.&lt;ref name="Newcity188ff"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;188ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The new, longer copyright term only applied to works that were still copyrighted in the USSR in 1973.&lt;ref name="Newcity80"/&gt;

Copyrights could be inherited. The rights of heirs and other legal successors were restored: they were entitled to receive the full royalties on a work. The reduced rates for heirs of at most 50% of the standard schedule were abandoned, but increased taxation of royalties received by heirs offset this benefit again.&lt;ref name="Elst86_fn165"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;86, footnote 165.&lt;/ref&gt; If no heirs existed, or the author had disinherited them or had willed his works to the state, copyright ceased with the author's death (this had already been the case under the 1961/1964 laws).&lt;ref name="Loeber34"&gt;Loeber,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;34, citing article 552 (section VII on successions) of the 1964 Civil Code of the RSFSR, with amendments up to 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel to the new laws, the republics also issued new royalty schedules,&lt;ref name="Newcity83"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;83.&lt;/ref&gt; generally with decreasing remuneration scales: an author was, for instance, entitled to more money on the first print run than on subsequent runs.&lt;ref name="Newcity86f"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;86f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levitsky194ff"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;194ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major change was that the freedom of translation was revoked. Translations were from 1973 on subject to the consent of the copyright owner of the original work. The copyright on a translation belonged to the translator.&lt;ref name="Newcity75"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In exchange, two new free uses were included in the law in 1973. The first was a very broad free use permission allowing newspapers to reproduce any published report or scientific, artistic, literary, or oral work; either in the original or as a translation.&lt;ref name="Newcity110"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;110.&lt;/ref&gt; This broad permission was exploited by some publications such as ''Literaturnaya Gazeta'', which published on October 24, 1973 long translated excerpts of ''Marilyn'', [[Norman Mailer]]'s biography of [[Marilyn Monroe]], and again on January 1, 1974 a large translated excerpt from ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'' by [[Kurt Vonnegut]]. This practice caused sufficient negative publicity for the USSR in the West that Soviet publishers purchased the publication rights in Russian language on these works shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name="Newcity111f"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;111f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second new free use provision permitted non-commercial reproduction of printed works for scientific or educational purposes. According to Newcity, this permission was limited to reproduction by photocopying.&lt;ref name="Newcity112"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;112.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, another additional free use permission was added, which allowed free republication in [[Braille]] of a published work.&lt;ref name="Newcity114"/&gt;

=== Licensing ===
Until 1973, copyright in the Soviet Union was non-transferrable. Authors could not sign away their copyrights; they only could grant a publisher a limited right to use a work for a specific purpose for a limited time (typically five years). For publication, authors had to use standard authors' contracts that were prescribed by the government. Slightly different standard contracts existed for different kinds of works, but they all shared this same basic characteristic. In all cases, the intended use of the work by a publisher was exactly described (e.g. including the size of a print run for print publications), and if the publisher accepted the delivered work, he was obliged to actually publish it within a set time frame (the first edition had to appear after at most one or two years, depending on the kind of work).&lt;ref name="Levitsky156"&gt;Levitsky&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;156.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Soviet Union joined the UCC, a new type of freely negotiable licences was introduced to facilitate dealing with publishers abroad, and in particular in the West. Copyrights, especially the right to publish a work, became transferrable through these licenses.&lt;ref name="Newcity71"/&gt; The intention clearly was that the old-style authors' contracts were to be used amongst Soviet partners for domestic publication, whereas the new licensing scheme was to be  employed towards foreign publishers. Upon a decree of August 16, 1973,&lt;ref name="Elst86"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;86.&lt;/ref&gt; the "[[All-Union Agency on Copyrights]]" (VAAP &amp;ndash; ''{{lang|ru-Latn|Vsesoiuznoe agentstvo po avtorskim pravam}}''; {{lang|ru|Всесоюзное агентство по авторским правам, ВААП}}) was founded on September 20, 1973. The VAAP replaced the several previously existing collecting societies (such as the VUOAP),&lt;ref name="Newcity126ff"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;126ff.&lt;/ref&gt; taking over their tasks and additionally managing copyrights on foreign works in the USSR and also the copyrights on Soviet works abroad.&lt;ref name="Elst86"/&gt; Officially, the VAAP was a non-governmental organization sponsored by creative unions (such as the [[USSR Union of Writers|Union of Soviet Writers]]) and seven state organs; but for all practical purposes, it was a state agency.&lt;ref name="Elst86"/&gt; All contracts with foreign publishers had to be concluded through VAAP; authors were forbidden to negotiate directly with foreign publishers.&lt;ref name="Loeber14f"&gt;Loeber&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;14f.&lt;/ref&gt; In the standard authors' publishing contracts, an author transferred the right to use the work abroad to the first publisher; and publishers were also obliged to go through VAAP for international copyright deals.&lt;ref name="Loeber15"&gt;Loeber&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt; The VAAP held the state monopoly on the import and export of copyrights.&lt;ref name="Elst99"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;99.&lt;/ref&gt; Only the state organs for cinematography ([[Goskino]], through its [[Soveksportfilm]] agency&lt;ref name="fbj"&gt;Trager, D. G.: ''Films by Jove v. Berov'', Memorandum and Order of August 27, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;) and television and radio broadcasts ([[Gosteleradio]]), as well as the news agency [[RIA Novosti|Novosti]] were exempted from that monopoly, but even they had to register all contracts with foreign partners with VAAP.&lt;ref name="Newcity130"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elst87_fn172"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;87, footnote 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

The accession to the UCC caused a dual system in Soviet copyright law, with the effect that foreign works published after May 27, 1973, were actually granted a stronger copyright protection than Soviet works because for foreign works the definition of the UCC of "publication" applied,&lt;ref name="ucc_publ"&gt;[[Universal Copyright Convention]], article VI: "'Publication', as used in this Convention, means the reproduction in tangible form and the general distribution to the public of copies of a work from which it can be read or otherwise visually perceived."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elst95f"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;95f.&lt;/ref&gt; which was narrower than the definition of "publication" in Soviet law,&lt;ref name="Elst74a"/&gt; which continued to be applied to Soviet works.&lt;ref name="Elst95f"/&gt; The duality was also emphasized by the new licensing scheme. In the years following the accession to the UCC, considerable doctrinal confusion ensued amongst Soviet scholars on how to reconcile such dual treatment with the Soviet ideology or ideals.&lt;ref name="Elst100ff"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;100ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars proposed further changes and clarifications beyond the changes necessary to conform to the UCC.&lt;ref name="Elst103"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;103.&lt;/ref&gt; Elst concludes that the accession to the UCC questioned the internal consistency of Soviet law and undermined several of its basic principles,&lt;ref name="Elst103"/&gt; and that the myriad of improvement suggestions by scholars actually caused new legal uncertainties.&lt;ref name="Elst109"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;109.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1991 Fundamentals ==

[[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]]'s [[Perestroika]] also had repercussions on the copyright law. From 1987 to 1990, a number of decrees modified the legislation on copyright and related areas. New remuneration rates that defined much higher royalties than the previous schedules were issued in 1987; the decreasing scales were given up at the same time: the royalties for all subsequent printings of a work were defined uniformly to amount to 70% of the rates for the first publication.&lt;ref name="Elst358"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;358.&lt;/ref&gt; Important changes occurred two years later, when the monopoly of the VAAP on foreign trade in copyrights was broken. Authors henceforth could negotiate directly with foreign publishers; and even the clause in the mandatory model contracts for publication that assigned this right from the author to his publisher was abolished. Likewise, Soviet publishers were free to negotiate with foreign authors or publishers licenses to publish foreign works in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Elst360"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;360, mentioning also that the inconvertibility of the ruble posed practical problems for the import of copyrights.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1987,&lt;ref name="Elst369"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;369.&lt;/ref&gt; a work group tasked with adapting the Soviet copyright law to a market economy was formed.&lt;ref name="Elst381"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;381.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1990, the work group presented a draft for a revised section IV of the Fundamentals on copyright and a new section IV A on neighbouring rights.&lt;ref name="Elst369"/&gt; But the proposal, comprising 32 articles, remained unused; the Supreme Soviet's Committee for legislation published in March 1990 its own draft version of the new Fundamentals that ignored many of the innovations found in the work group's proposal. This draft was, with some modifications, passed as law on March 31, 1991.&lt;ref name="Elst370"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;370.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the briefness of chapter IV of the new 1991 Fundamentals&amp;mdash;it consisted of only 10 articles, of which 2 covered neighbouring rights and one was on measures against copyright infringements&amp;mdash;it was a radical break with the previous practice.&lt;ref name="Elst380"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;380, calling the differences from previous Soviet copyright legislation "spectacular".&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new law aimed at harmonizing the Soviet republics' copyright laws, which had in some areas drifted apart over the years. This was achieved by making the 1991 Fundamentals more explicit and giving the republics less leeway to devise their own rules.&lt;ref name="Elst372"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;372.&lt;/ref&gt;

The author of a work again was granted a set of exclusive rights: the personal (or moral) rights to authorship, name, and the integrity of the work, and the property (or economic) rights to the work: the right to publish or use the work, and the right to remuneration for use of the work or for granting permission to use the work. A "use" of a work was defined by a non-exhaustive list that included broadcasting, performance, modification, adaptation, recording, and distribution. "Publication" was clearly defined to be subject to the author's permission.&lt;ref name="Elst375"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;375.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial copyright owner in all cases was the "citizen" (i.e., the natural person) who had created the work.&lt;ref name="Elst373"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;373. Elst criticizes the use of the term "citizen", pointing out that works of foreigners were also copyrighted under article 136 of the 1991 Fundamentals if they were first (possibly simultaneously) published in the USSR or if they were subject to an international treaty such as the UCC.&lt;/ref&gt; The copyright of legal entities was abolished; publishers of scientific collections or encyclopedias as well as film studios were only granted a derived right to use the work in its entirety, subject to the remuneration of the authors.&lt;ref name="Elst374"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;374.&lt;/ref&gt; For [[work made for hire|works made for hire]], the employer was granted a similar right to use the work, limited to at most three years since the delivery of the work. Shorter terms could be defined contractually.&lt;ref name="Elst374"/&gt; The state's authors' contracts for publication were no longer mandatory, and the upper limits to remuneration were dropped: contractual freedom was established.&lt;ref name="Elst376"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;376.&lt;/ref&gt;

The copyright term was extended from 25 years to generally 50 years ''p.m.a.'' for all kinds of works,&lt;ref name="Elst377"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;377.&lt;/ref&gt; and the law for the first time made explicit that no [[copyright formalities|formalities]] were required for a work to be copyrighted.&lt;ref name="Elst373"/&gt; Anonymous or pseudonymous works were copyrighted for 50 years since their initial publication, unless the real identity of the author became known during that time and thus 50 years ''p.m.a.'' applied. The moral rights to authorship, name, and integrity of the work were perpetual;&lt;ref name="Elst378"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;378.&lt;/ref&gt; and authors could only transfer usage rights on a work (but not their right to remuneration for such uses, which always remained a personal right of the author).&lt;ref name="Elst376"/&gt;

The list of free uses was reduced considerably, and the remaining allowed free uses were defined much more narrowly than before. Similar to [[fair use]], any such free use was only allowed if it didn't infringe upon the normal exploitation of the work or the legitimate interests of the author.&lt;ref name="Elst376"/&gt; Compulsory licenses were abolished altogether.&lt;ref name="Elst375"/&gt;

[[Neighbouring right]]s were introduced for the first time in Soviet legislation. Broadcasters, performers, and producers of phono- or videograms were granted exclusive neighbouring rights for a period of 50 years since the first broadcast, performance, or distribution of a phono- or videogram. They were also granted&amp;mdash;in excess of the provisions of the [[Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations|Rome Convention]]&amp;mdash;the moral rights to name and integrity of the work.&lt;ref name="Elst378ff"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;378ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the new 1991 Fundamentals could enter in force on January 1, 1992, the USSR had been dissolved. The provisions of the 1991 legislation never became effective in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Elst370"/&gt;

== Transition to post-Soviet legislation in Russia ==

In Russia, the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation passed a decree that made the USSR 1991 Fundamentals effective in Russia from August 3, 1992 on, insofar as these Fundamentals contradicted neither the [[Constitution of the Russian Federation]] nor other legislative acts of Russia passed after June 12, 1990,&lt;ref name="Elst255"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;255.&lt;/ref&gt; and only on a temporary basis until the Russian Federation would have adopted a new, own Civil Code.&lt;ref name="Elst372"/&gt; The original USSR executive decree for the 1991 Fundamentals, which laid down the transitory provisions, did not enter in force in Russia, though,&lt;ref name="Elst371"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;371.&lt;/ref&gt; and the old Russian Civil Code remained in force insofar as it didn't contradict the 1991 Fundamentals. Section IV of the 1991 Fundamentals was thus in effect for exactly one year until on August 3, 1993, the new [[Copyright law of Russia]] entered in Force.&lt;ref name="Elst372"/&gt;

That new Russian law had a general copyright term of 50 years ''p.m.a.''&lt;ref name="Elst436"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;436.&lt;/ref&gt; and was retroactive,&lt;ref name="Elst525ff"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;525ff.&lt;/ref&gt; restoring copyright on works on which the shorter Soviet copyright terms had already expired&lt;ref name="supreme_court"&gt;[[Supreme Court of the Russian Federation]], Plenum decision no. 15/2006, point 34.&lt;/ref&gt; and even copyrighting works that had until then not been considered copyrightable works at all (such as performances, which under the 1993 law were subject to a neighbouring right that had not existed under Soviet legislation).&lt;ref name="Elst528_530"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;528&amp;ndash;530.&lt;/ref&gt; The new Russian copyright terms from the 1993 law became applicable to all works of authors who had died 1943 or later, or to works published in 1943 or later.&lt;ref name="Elst526"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;526.&lt;/ref&gt; For authors who had lived and worked during the [[Great Patriotic War]], the copyright term was extended by four years; the corresponding year for such authors and their works was thus 1939.&lt;ref name="Elst441"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;441.&lt;/ref&gt; For work first published after the death of the author, the term started at the posthumous publication of the work,&lt;ref name="Elst438"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;438.&lt;/ref&gt; and for posthumously rehabilitated authors, the copyright term of the 1993 law began to run with their [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitation]], making it possible that even older works were placed under copyright again in these cases&amp;mdash;examples include the works of [[Boris Pilniak]] (executed in 1938, rehabilitated in 1957), [[Isaac Babel]] (executed 1940, rehabilitated 1954), or also [[Osip Mandelstam]] (died 1938, rehabilitated 1956/1987).&lt;ref name="Elst532f"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;532f.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors on whose works copyright was restored were [[Anna Akhmatova]] (died 1966), [[Vera Mukhina]] (died 1953, sculptor of the statue "[[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman]]"), [[Aleksey Shchusev]] (died 1949, architect of the [[Lenin Mausoleum]]), [[Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy|Aleksey Tolstoy]] (died 1945), and many others.&lt;ref name="Elst532f"/&gt; An extreme example is [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'': the work was first published posthumously in 1966. At that time, the Soviet copyright term of then 15 years ''p.m.a.'' had already expired as Bulgakov had died in 1940. The new Russian copyright law from 1993 placed this work under copyright again, because the 50-year term was calculated from 1966 on.&lt;ref name="Elst533"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;533.&lt;/ref&gt;

The old Soviet law was thus rendered largely obsolete in Russia; it remained applicable only to copyright violations that had occurred before August 3, 1993.&lt;ref name="Savelyeva25"&gt;Savelyeva, p.&amp;nbsp;25.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dillon v. Legg''''', [[case citation|68 Cal. 2d 728]] (1968), was a [[legal case|case]] decided by the [[Supreme Court of California]] that established the [[tort]] of [[negligent infliction of emotional distress]].  To date, it is the most persuasive decision of the most persuasive state supreme court in the United States during the latter half of the 20th century: ''Dillon'' has been favorably cited and followed by at least twenty reported out-of-state appellate decisions, more than any other California appellate decision in the period from 1940 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Jake Dear and Edward W. Jessen, ''" Followed Rates" and Leading State Cases, 1940-2005'', &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;[http://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/41/2/essay/DavisVol41No2_Dear.pdf 41 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 683, 694]&lt;/span&gt;(2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
A mother, Margery M. Dillon, and her daughter witnessed the death of her other child in a car accident caused by a [[negligent]] driver, David Luther Legg.  The mother and daughter sued for emotional distress as a result of witnessing the accident. The accident occurred at the intersection of Bluegrass Road and Clover Lane, a residential area in [[Sacramento]], where the Dillons lived. The trial court dismissed the claim under the prevailing zone of danger rule: the plaintiff needed to be in physical danger of the accident itself to recover for emotional distress.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J.A. et al.  ''The Torts Process, Seventh Edition.'' Aspen Publishers, New York, NY: 2007, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyer|first=Robert G. |author2=Christopher M. Weaver|title=Law and mental health: a case-based approach  |publisher=Guilford Press|date=December 15, 2005|isbn=1-59385-221-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_zU4PCsY774C&amp;pg=PA182&amp;lpg=PA182&amp;dq=Dillon+v.+Legg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hWciUjjjEI&amp;sig=JUu9Be_CBOnukj-o156mMdlsfJk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=waDWStTnBIqCkQXX6tHcCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Dillon%20v.%20Legg&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
===Majority opinion===
The court relied on [[foreseeability]] to establish whether or not a negligent defendant owed a [[duty of care]] to a bystander. The court urged a case by case analysis of several factors to determine if foreseeability would create a duty to a bystander:

*Whether the plaintiff was near the scene of the accident,
*Whether the plaintiff suffered an emotional shock from contemporaneously observing the accident, and
*Whether the plaintiff is closely related to the victim

Using these criteria, the court determined that it was foreseeable that the negligent operation of an automobile could cause emotional distress to a mother witnessing the injury of her child in an accident.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J.A. et al., p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traynor's dissent===
In his dissenting opinion, Justice Traynor asserted that the case should have been decided according to the zone of danger rule enunciated in the case ''Amaya v. Home Ice, Fuel &amp; Supply Co.''&lt;ref&gt;''Dillon v. Legg'', 68 Cal.2d 728, 748 (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burke's dissent===
In dissent, Justice Burke asserted that the majority had adopted arguments that were previously rejected in ''Amaya''.  Burke criticized the guidelines offered by the majority as insufficient protection against possibly limitless liability.  Burke viewed the limitations on liability inherent in the zone of danger rule as logical and necessary, and thought that such a pronounced change in liability rules should be adopted by the legislature and not the courts.&lt;ref&gt;''Dillon'', 68 Cal.2d at 749-52&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Hart''' was an early settler of the American Colonies who, as town clerk, wrote the [[Flushing Remonstrance]], a precursor to the [[United States Constitution]]'s provision on [[freedom of religion]] in the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].&lt;ref name="Waller1899"/&gt;

==Early life==

Little is known with any degree of certainty regarding Edward Hart's life before 1640. Genealogical sources give place and date of birth, year and manner of emigration to North America, and first places of residence within the American colonies, but none provide documentary evidence for their assertions.{{refn|group=note|On this topic see also Andrews's ''Genealogical history of Deacon Stephen Hart and his descendants'' which says that Edmund Hart, probable brother of Stephen, was one of the first settlers of Dorchester, having lived there from 1632.&lt;ref name="Andrews1875"/&gt; Edward Hart is said to have moved from Dorchester to Weymouth, Massachusetts, in 1634 or 1636 and to Farmington, Connecticut, the following year, but this was also likely to have been Edmund. On Edward in Dorchester and Weymouth see Robertson's ''Profiles of the signers of the Flushing Remonstrance, December 27, 1657''&lt;ref name="Robertson1973"/&gt;{{rp|56}} and the ''Hart Memorial''.&lt;ref name="Andrews1875"/&gt;{{rp|56}} For the likelihood that Edmund is meant see Whittmore's ''Genealogical Guide to the Early Settlers of America'',&lt;ref name="Whittemore1898"/&gt; Pope's ''The pioneers of Massachusetts, a descriptive list, drawn from records of the colonies, towns and churches and other contemporaneous documents'',&lt;ref name="Pope1900"/&gt; Holmes's ''Directory of the ancestral heads of New England families, 1620-1700'',&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt; and the source used by Singleton: ''Genealogical history of Deacon Stephen Hart and his descendants, 1632. 1875: with an introduction of miscellaneous Harts and their progenitors, as far as known; to which is added a list of all the clergy of the name found, all the physicians, all the lawyers, the authors, and soldiers'' by Alfred Andrews (New Britain, Connecticut, Hart, Austin, 1875).}} A man named Edward Hart was one of the early settlers of Rhode Island having obtained a plot of land from [[Roger Williams]] and signed an agreement for the government of Providence in 1640.&lt;ref name="Bayles1891"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Staples1843"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Staples1843"/&gt; This man married a woman named Margaret whose surname is unknown.&lt;ref name="Austin1887"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Torrey1985"/&gt; There is no definite evidence that this Edward Hart is the same as the Edward Hart of Flushing, Long Island, but sources generally accept that he is.&lt;ref name="Robertson1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Torrey1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy1939"/&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name="Chapin1916"/&gt;

==Founding settler of Flushing==

Although there is some level of uncertainty about his prior whereabouts, there is no doubt that on October 10, 1645, Hart was one of 18 men who received a charter from the Dutch governor of [[New Netherland]], [[William Kieft]], to establish the town of Vlissingen (i.e., [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]]) in Long Island.&lt;ref name="Laws and ordinances of New Netherland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross1902"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|In addition to Edward Hart the charter establishing Flushing lists Thomas Applegate, Thomas Beddard, Lawrence Dutch, Robert Field, Thomas Farrington, Robert Firman, John Hicks, [[John Lawrence (New York)|John Lawrence]], William Lawrence, John Marston, Michael Millard, William Pidgeon, Thomas Stiles, Thomas Saul, Henry Sawtelle, [[John Townsend (Norwich)|John Townsend]], and William Thorn.&lt;ref name="Laws and ordinances of New Netherland"/&gt;}} Three of these men came to Flushing from Rhode Island and may have known Hart there. The others, so far as is known, came from Massachusetts, Connecticut, or other towns in Long Island.{{refn|group=note|Applegate, Field, and Hicks came to Flushing from Rhode Island; Stiles from Connecticut, the Lawrences and Thorn from Long Island, and the rest from Massachusetts so far as is known.}}

In 1642, after efforts to attract Dutch immigrants had disappointing results, the administration in New Netherland and its parent governors in Amsterdam began to accept applications from English settlers to form towns on Long Island.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|38–39, 41–42, et. seq.}}&lt;ref name="McKinley1900"/&gt; These settlers brought with them the forms of government common in the settlements of New England. Based on practices common in English towns, these were generally more liberal than the ones granted to New Netherland's Dutch communities&lt;ref name="McKinley1900"/&gt;{{rp|12, 18}} and the charter granted to the applicants from Flushing was no exception.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|15–16}}&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;{{rp|161–162}}{{refn|group=note|In granting unusual privileges to settlers from New England the administration in New Amsterdam expected to gain revenue from taxes, manpower for defense against the predations of unfriendly Indians, and local resistance to encroachments by the administrators of New England colonies.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|14–19}}&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;{{rp|161–162}}}} Having obtained privileges of self-government that were not granted to the towns where Dutch settlers resided, the settlers from New England were energetic in defending and where possible expanding these rights against efforts of the administration in New Amsterdam to erode them.&lt;ref name="Stiles1895"/&gt;

In 1648 Hart, as one of Flushing's landholders, joined with four other men to protest the payment of tithes to the pastor of a state-sponsored church and to question the manner of choosing the town's sole magistrate, the [[schout]], who acted as court officer, prosecutor, and sheriff.&lt;ref name="Bailey1894"/&gt; On January 17 of that year the government of New Netherland, now headed by [[Peter Stuyvesant]] summoned the five men to answer for this resistance to the authorities in New Netherland and ordered them to accept the Dutch method for electing their schout.&lt;ref name="Waller1899"/&gt;{{rp|231}}&lt;ref name="Stiles1895"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey1894"/&gt;

Stuyvesant did not relent in his efforts to require the inhabitants of Flushing to support a pastor of his choosing nor did he change the method for electing a schout.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|82}} However, a few months later he expanded local government by granting the town's freeholders the right to elect three additional magistrates, called schaepens, and a clerk.&lt;ref name="Waller1899"/&gt;{{rp|23}} The election of the officials would be subject to confirmation by the New Netherland government but in practice the town's nominations of its officials were routinely accepted.{{refn|group=note|The frequency of elections was not stipulated but is understood to have been annual. In the first election following this change in the town's charter John Underhill was named schout; John Townsend, John Hicks, and William Thorne were named schaepens; and John Lawrence was named clerk. Although one source says that Hart was elected to the position of town clerk on April 27, 1648, that source does not cite evidence,&lt;ref name="Kennedy1939"/&gt;{{rp|3}} and other sources which do give evidence maintain that John Lawrence, was elected at that time.&lt;ref name="Waller1899"/&gt;{{rp|35}}&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan1865"/&gt;{{rp|44, 88, 105}} Flushing and other towns in New Netherland nominated officials for approval by authorities in New Amsterdam. The form is given in a council minute of March 25, 1656.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|343}}}} Although there is some doubt about the names and terms of early clerks, it is certain that Hart was clerk in 1656 for in July of that year he signed himself clerk in responding on behalf of the town's schout and schaepens to a demand from the New Netherland government for payment of a tenth of the town's agricultural production as annual tax as provided in its charter. Hart's letter said that Flushing was "willing to do that which is reasonable and honest" and proposed an amount of produce ("fiftie scipple of peas and twentie-five of wheat") which was apparently acceptable.&lt;ref name="Waller1899"/&gt;{{rp|35–36}}&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|361–362}} That he continued as clerk in 1657 is shown by a letter of his dated January 23, 1657, affirming the town's rights and privileges and complaining that the neighboring town of Hempstead was encroaching on its lands.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|384–385}}&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan1865"/&gt;{{rp|105}}

==Writer of the Flushing Remonstrance==
{{main|Flushing Remonstrance}}
The next document bearing Hart's signature as clerk is the famous [[Flushing Remonstrance]] of December 27, 1657.&lt;ref name="Waller1899"/&gt;{{rp|40–41}}&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|402–408}}&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Corwin1901"/&gt;{{rp|412–414}}&lt;ref name="FriendsIntelligencer"/&gt;{{rp|54–58}} The towns settled by immigrants from New England were generally granted charters recognizing their right to freedom of conscience but not freedom of religion.&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;{{rp|167}} In the case of Flushing, the relevant clause granted the original patentees the right "to have and Enjoy the Liberty of Conscience, according of Religion; to the Custome and manner of Holland, without molestacōn or disturbance, from any Magistrate or Magistrates, or any other Ecclesiasticall Minister, that may extend Jurisdiccōn over them."&lt;ref name="Laws and ordinances of New Netherland"/&gt; In practice this meant that men would not be prosecuted for religious practices that did not strongly contradict those of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] which was the official public church in Holland.&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;{{rp|167}} It also meant that personal beliefs that were contrary to the tenets of the established church would be tolerated so long as they were kept private and expressed only in the narrow circle of the family. Meetings for the public expression of dissenting worship would be prosecuted.&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;{{rp|3}} Although the early settlers of Flushing complied with these strictures, some of them came into conflict with Stuyvesant and the New Netherlands government when charismatic speakers began to come among them proclaiming nonconformist beliefs.{{refn|group=note|In 1656 a prominent Baptist minister, [[William Wickenden]], was banished and fined for holding illegal religious gatherings and baptizing adult Christians in Flushing.&lt;ref name="JacksonKeller2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Root1890"/&gt; A year later three Quakers were sent away from Manhattan for public preaching and one of them, Robert Hodgson, moved on to Long Island where some of the inhabitants, including residents of Flushing, gave him a warm welcome. Arrested once again, he refused to acknowledge that he had done wrong and would not perform hard labor to which he had been sentenced. As punishment he was treated very severely: put in solitary confinement, beaten, and tortured.&lt;ref name="Bowden1850"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GarmanThesis"/&gt;{{rp|71–77}}&lt;ref name="Brodhead1853"/&gt;}} Believing that Quakers posed the most serious threat to religious and civil tranquility, the administration in New Amsterdam proclaimed that any person who took a Quaker into his home, even for a single night, would be fined fifty pounds and that any ships bringing any Quaker into the province would be confiscated.&lt;ref name="Brodhead1853"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1918Jstor"/&gt;{{rp|210}}&lt;ref name="MaikaJstor"/&gt;{{rp|38}} The schout, magistrates, of Flushing, along with twenty-eight other freeholders of that town and two from neighboring Jamaica recognized that they could not, in conscience, obey this regulation and signed a protest, the Remonstrance, explaining why they could not comply.&lt;ref name="Waller1899"/&gt;{{rp|40–41}}&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;{{rp|219–220}} The document says Quakers are not seducers of the people nor are they "destructive unto magistracy and ministers" but—along with Presbyterians, Independents, and Baptists—are members of the "household of faith" who, when they "come unto us, we cannot in conscience lay violent hands upon them, but give them free ingress and egress unto our town and houses, so as God shall persuade our consciences." It closes by saying that the signatories "desire to be true subjects both of church and state" according to the law of God and also to the provisions of the town's charter.&lt;ref name="FriendsIntelligencer"/&gt;

The collections of colonial documents of this period contain many protests against government actions, but none of such historic import or eloquence of expression as this.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|passim}}&lt;ref name="MaikaJstor"/&gt;{{rp|37–38}} The Remonstrance "concretely illustrates the seventeenth century practice of speaking Scripture" and is "an unusually rich display of rhetoric and fine English style."&lt;ref name="HarringtonJstor"/&gt; It gives forceful religious arguments for tolerance of other religions and the separation of church and state.&lt;ref name="Haefeli2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Field1863"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Finkelman2003"/&gt; Nonetheless it is framed on Dutch law, adheres closely to legal forms, and contains nothing that might be construed as politically rebellious.&lt;ref name="Voorhees2007"/&gt;

==Government response to the Remonstrance==

The signers of the Remonstrance followed correct procedure in having the town schout, Tobias Feake, submit it to the provincial schout, Nicasius de Sille. De Sille passed it on to Stuyvesant who immediately ordered de Sille to arrest and imprison Feake.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|403–404}}&lt;ref name="Corwin1901"/&gt;{{rp|414}}{{refn|group=note|The provincial schout—officially called Schout-Fiscal and informally called Fiscal—functioned as attorney general and sheriff.&lt;ref name="OCallaghanRegister"/&gt;{{rp|38}}}}{{refn|group=note|There is greater than usual variation in the spelling of the name Feake.

The Director-General and Council forgive and pardon his error this time on condition of his paying the costs and misses of law.&lt;/blockquote&gt; On March 26 the director-general and council passed an ordinance intended to prevent the town from ever again submitting a "seditious and mutinous" document like the Remonstrance. Saying that "all the late Schouts successively have manifested no small negligence," it added new qualifications for the office aimed at obtaining persons "better versed in Dutch Practice, and somewhat conversant in both languages, the English and Dutch." It also prohibited town meetings for conducting ordinary business and, in their place, instituted a town council consisting of seven persons to assist the schout and magistrates and it required the town to acquire and maintain "an Orthodox Minister" to conduct religious services.&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan1868"/&gt;{{rp|338–341}}

==Responsibility for the Remonstrance==

Hart gave somewhat inconsistent statements in his interrogation by Stuyvesant, de Sille, and Tonneman, saying first that he drew up the Remonstrance on the order of those who signed it in order to record the "opinion of the people" of the town and then saying that he had prepared it before the town meeting at which he submitted it for consideration. He pleaded ignorance concerning the responsibility of any specific individuals as instigators prior to the town meeting. Pressed to explain his inconsistent testimony he said the draft he prepared prior to the meeting contained "what he thought to be the opinion of the people." The questions submitted to Hart show that Stuyvesant and the two councilors suspected that the four town officials who signed the document (the schout, two magistrates, and Hart) bore primary responsibility for it.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|404}} After interrogating the two magistrates and after the two of them and Hart had submitted apologies for their actions, the governor and councilors settled on the schout as mainly responsible.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|409}} Although they singled out Feake for punishment, the ordinance they passed subsequent to the release from imprisonment and pardoning of the Hart and the magistrates maintains that all four of the town's officials were jointly at fault. It says  that most of the men who signed the Remonstrance were "urged to subscribe by the previous signatures of the Schout, Clerk and some Magistrates."&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan1868"/&gt;{{rp|339}}

Historians who have considered this subject have not agreed about who took the lead in preparing the Remonstrance and, as a result, it is not known which of its signers most inspired its moving appeal for freedom of conscience. Some maintain that the schout, Feake, was mainly responsible.&lt;ref name="Robertson1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zwierlein1910"/&gt;{{rp|220}} Others say it was mainly Hart's doing&lt;ref name="Bailey1894"/&gt; or that, at least, the language was his.&lt;ref name="Robertson1973"/&gt; One says that the four town officials were more or less equally responsible.&lt;ref name="Bowden1850"/&gt; Many accounts say that the responsibility was communal.{{refn|group=note|Most sources take this view. See in particular ''New Netherland and the Dutch Origins of American Religious Liberty'' by Evan Haefeli (2013).&lt;ref name="Haefeli2013"/&gt;{{rp|170}}}} One author makes a case for a strong influence of Baptist beliefs among those who signed the document.&lt;ref name="GarmanThesis"/&gt;

==Life of Edward Hart subsequent to the Remonstrance==

There is little information about Hart following his pardoning and release from prison. In 1660 and 1661 his name appears as a witness on deeds for transfer of land and in the latter year he was listed as a tax collector in Flushing.&lt;ref name="OCallaghanRegister"/&gt;{{rp|36}} On April 13, 1662, Hart wrote Stuyvesant on behalf of Flushing residents to request help in dealing with three Indians "who demand pay for the Land wee live vpon"&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt;{{rp|512}} and later that year (June 26) A man whose name is given as Eduart Hart obtained a translation from the Notary Public in New Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="HollandSocietyYearbook1900"/&gt;{{rp|144}} After that there is no assured documentary evidence regarding him. The last references to a man who is supposed to have been Hart are in records of land transfer. In 1679 a man named Robert West acquired land originally owned by an Edward Hart in Providence, R.I.&lt;ref name="Hopkins2009"/&gt; and in 1707 land formerly owned by him is referred to in a deed filed by a man named William Field.&lt;ref name="Commissioners1909"/&gt; It is likely but not certain that this Edward Hart is the same as the one who wrote the Remonstrance.

==Family of Edward Hart==

Hart's life after 1662 is described from inferences lacking a clear documentary trail. With his wife, Margaret, he is said to have had two sons, Thomas and Jonathan. Hart having returned to Rhode Island and then died, his wife is supposed to have remarried.{{refn|group=note|Examples of these sources include a number of genealogical sites and the following monographs: ''Edward Hart; descendants and allied families'' by Clara Hart Kennedy (Bloomington, Ill., 1939)&lt;ref name="Kennedy1939"/&gt; and ''Profiles of the signers of the Flushing Remonstrance, December 27, 1657'' by Purcell B. Robertson (4 vols. typescript held in Queens Public Library, New York, N.Y.)&lt;ref name="Robertson1973"/&gt; For an instance of doubt about these suppositions see "The Ancestry of the Hon. John Hart, of Hopewell, N.J., Signer of the Declaration of Independence" by Frederick W. Bailey, in ''The New York Genealogical and Biographical Record'', Volumes 25-26 (New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, 1894, New York).&lt;ref name="Bailey1894"/&gt;}} Some genealogical and other sources say that Jonathan Hart died in Newtown, Long Island, in 1671,&lt;ref name="Kennedy1939"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold1996"/&gt; however ''Early Wills of Westchester County, New York, from 1664 to 1784'' by William Smith Pelletreau (Francis P. Harper, New York, 1898) says that the family of one Monmouth Hart of Rye, New York, is descended from an Edmund Hart who signed the Flushing Remonstrance and that his son, Jonathan Hart, came to Rye in 1685 and subsequently married Hannah Budd.&lt;ref name="PelletreauHaviland1898"/&gt; Thomas Hart is said to have married Freeborn Williams, a daughter of Roger Williams&lt;ref name="Kennedy1939"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold1996"/&gt; and this fact is supported by a note in ''The genealogical dictionary of Rhode Island'' by John Osborne Austin (Joel Munsells Sons, Albany, 1887). The note says that the Edward Hart who was granted land in Providence and subsequently signed the civil compact of 1640 was the husband of a woman named Margaret and the two were parents of a son named Thomas. It says that this son lived in Newport, Rhode Island, and was husband of Freeborn Williams, daughter of [[Roger Williams]] and his wife Mary.&lt;ref name="Austin1887"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bolton1881"/&gt; Although most sources accept that this Edward Hart is the same man as the one who drafted the Remonstrance, they offer no evidence to support their inference.

==Documentary evidence on the life of Edward Hart==

In 1789 all the records of the town of Flushing were destroyed in a fire{{refn|group=note|"The most important event of the closing years of the last century was the destruction of the town records by the burning of the residence of the clerk, Jeremiah Vanderbilt. It was set on fire by Nellie, a slave girl belonging to Capt. Daniel Braine, who had been hired to work in the family, and who, conceiving a dislike for her new mistress, took this way to revenge the fancied injury. She was arrested in company with Sarah, one of Vanderbilt's slaves, and on their own confession they were sentenced to be hanged. Sarah was afterwards reprieved on condition that she be removed from the island. Nellie was hanged at Jamaica, after having been in jail fifty weeks. Aaron Burr, then attorney-general for the State, conducted the prosecution."&lt;ref name="HistoryOfQueensCounty1882"/&gt;{{rp|85}}}} and in 1911 a fire caused serious damage to the manuscripts of the New Netherland colony.{{refn|group=note|"While many ...

This practice consists of an outpouring of ministry in which words and phrases of Scripture are woven into the discourse with no mention of "chapter or verse," but in a manner by which they can be clearly identified as Scripture. The ministry of George Fox displays this feature but the Flushing Remonstrance is an unusually concentrated illustration of it. In these ministers, Scripture had been so thoroughly assimilated that its words and phrases became a part of the person. What follows is the text of the Flushing Remonstrance with the Biblical phrases identified by chapter and verse in the King James Version. This compilation may not exhaust the Biblical elements to be found in the Remonstrance, but it suggests the possibilities. |doi=10.1353/qkh.1993.0010}}&lt;!--|access-date=2015-08-15 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Having felt the keen blasts of proscription and outlawry on account of their religious views, and having sought this place as a permanent refuge, relying upon the well accredited liberality of the government of Holland, which had purchased for its subjects the price of religious liberty at a terrible cost of blood and treasure, and which was disposed to accord the privileges it had gained to the oppressed of every nation—the people of Flushing were surprised to find, within three years from the date of their charter, that Governor Kieft was about to enforce upon them arbitrary and uncalled for restrictions in civil matters, as well as to impose upon them the maiutaiuance of a minister of the Reformed (State) Dutch Church. As his support would have to be made a tax upon the people, the Quakers resisted; and in this they were evidently joined by the English element in the community.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of these persons, Dorothy Waugh and Mary Witherhead, began to preach publicly in the streets, for which breach of the law they were arrested and imprisoned. A few days afterwards they were discharged; and the ship, with most of her Quaker passengers, sailed onward, through Hell-gate, to Rhode Island, "where all kinds of scum dwell, for it is nothing else than a sink for New England."&lt;br&gt;But Robert Hodgson, one of the Quakers, wishing to remain in the Dutch province, went over to Long Island. At Flushing he was well received. On visiting Heemstede, however, where Denton, the Presbyterian clergyman, ministered, Hodgson was arrested and committed to prison, whence he was transferred to the dungeon of Fort Amsterdam. Upon his examination before the council, he was convicted, and sentenced to labor two years at a wheelbarrow, along with a negro, or pay a fine of six hundred guilders. After a few days confinement, he was chained to a barrow, and ordered to work; and upon his refusal, was beaten by a negro with a tarred rope until he fell down. At length, after frequent scourgings and solitary imprisonments, the suffering Quaker was liberated, at the intercession of the director's sister, Anna, widow of Nicholas Bayard, and ordered to leave the province.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2826">A '''European Authorised Representative (E.A.R.)''' serves as a legal entity designated by non European Union (EU) manufacturers, to represent them in the EU and ensure their compliance with the [[European Directives]].

== Overview ==

Regulation of goods produced by manufactures outside of the European Union, especially in the medical devices industry, instigated the need for Authorised Representatives.  As clarified in the Medical Devices Directive amendment [[(93/42/EEC)]], it is required that alongside the [[CE mark]] all products must also have an Authorised Representative. As stated in this amendment, an '''Authorised Representative''' should serve as a contact point with the EU member states competent authorities.

An E.A.R. holds the responsibility to act as a neutral party between the competent authorities and the non EU manufacturers. They must ensure the manufacturer’s compliance with the conformity assessment procedure set out in the European directives which apply to the manufacture’s product. The EAR must uphold dual accountability with the manufactures if problems or questions arise regarding the product. The E.A.R. must provide their contact information for the manufacturer to place on the products, allowing the E.A.R. to be the primary contact for EU authorities.

== Duties of a European Authorised Representative ==

An E.A.R. observes the manufacturer's compliance with the conformity assessment procedure set out in the European directives which apply to the product.

They ensure the law is met by having Class I medical devices registered with the Competent Authorities before being placed on the market.

They ensure their contact information is available to the manufactures to be placed on all the products they are representing, thus acting as a primary contact for the EU Authorities.

They must notify EU Authorities of all major incidents pertaining to products.

An E.A.R. must understand all EU regulations from each of the EU member states as well as the four European Free Trade Association (EFTA) states, and provide notification of changes and amendments to directives that affect individual products.

They must keep the product’s technical file available at any time for the EU member states authorities and maintain confidentiality with manufacturer's sensitive product information, releasing them only to the appropriate authorities when called upon.

Its goal was "Strengthened Management of the Intelligence Community".
It supplemented and partially superseded [[Executive Order 12333]], signed in 1981 by President [[Ronald Reagan]], and was in turn partially supplemented and superseded by [[Executive Order 13470]].

Many of the clauses of the new executive order changed how US intelligence agencies were governed, and how they ultimately reported to the President, to reflect that when Executive Order 12333 was signed, the DCI [[Director of Central Intelligence]] was also the nominal chief of all US intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name=Eo13355/&gt;  
President Bush had created a new position, the [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI), and the changes reflected that the US intelligence agencies were to report to the President through the DNI.

The '''Fair Trade Commission''' ('''FTC'''; {{zh|c=公平交易委員會|p=Gōngpíngjiāoyì Wěiyuánhuì|poj=Kong-pêng Kau-e̍k Úi-oân-hōe}}) is an independent government agency subordinate to the [[Executive Yuan]] which is responsible for competition policy, trade practices, formulating fair trade policy, laws, regulations, investigating activities restricting competition, such as monopolies, mergers, collusions, cartels, and other unfair trade practices on the part of enterprises in the Republic of China ([[Taiwan]]).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov.tw/EnglishWeb/20000101299912311067.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827221240/http://www.ftc.gov.tw/EnglishWeb/20000101299912311067.htm |date=27 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FTC is different from other foreign government regulators in that the [[Consumer Protection]] functions is administered by the [[Consumer Protection Committee]].

==History==
The Fair Trade Commission was created in 1992 to regulate competition and enforced trade practices. It has the powers to investigate illegal activities such as [[predatory pricing]], collusion, cartels, mergers and other unfair trade practices that hurt choices, prices, create monopolies and reduce competition.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

'''Frost &amp; Sutcliffe v Tuiara''' [2004] 1 NZLR 782; (2003) 10 TCLR 912  is a cited case in New Zealand regarding whether a party owes another party concurrent duties in contract  and in tort.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Frost &amp; Sutcliffe were a law firm that represented the Tuiara's in a buyback agreement on their Mangere home, for which they also acted as the legal representatives of the finance company involved. The law firm gave them the following legal advice:

19 March 1999

Re: Sale of your property at 21 Ashley Avenue, Mangere. To Richmond Thornby Holdings Limited and Repurchase.

You have been asked to sell your property to Richmond Thornby Holdings Limited which will pay you only $8,000.00 now and will resell it to you in 6 weeks.

We note our advices to you as to our concern at advising family as regards to transaction of this type. This is especially the case when their own home is placed at risk. My initial advice to you would be “don’t”.

I record however, that you have decided that you do wish to proceed with the arrangement.

The effect of registration of the sale will mean that you have lost your home if anything goes wrong.
As advised, if for any reason Richmond Thornby Holdings Limited can’t get a release of the mortgage it will take on the property, effectively you will have lost your house and have to start again. You will have a right against the security the Company grants but this would be likely to be of no value.

We note that at this stage you have satisfied yourselves the Company will be in a position to repurchase the property from you in 6 weeks.

To summarise, our advice simply is it is better not to proceed with the transaction. We note however that you wish to assist your family, and you have done so in the full knowledge that the transaction is a financial risk to you and you may suffer financially in the event the Company being unable to complete the resale of the house for you.

We note we have strongly recommended you consult an independent Solicitor in respect of the matter but you have declined to so.
Yours faithfully''
FROST &amp; SUTCLIFFE

At trial, the Tuiara's denied they had ever received this letter, but the court disagreed with them on this.

The Tuiara's eventually followed through on the deal, accepting an $8,000 payment in return for temporarily transferring title of their house to a 3rd party.

Soon after entering into the agreement, the finance company involved went into liquidation, resulting in the Tuiara's losing their house.

They later sued the law firm for breach of contract, as well as for negligence in tort, with the Tuiara's claiming that Sutcliffe had encouraged them to proceed on the deal.

The High Court ruled that whilst they did not breach their fiduciary duty owed under contract, they did breach the duty of care they owed in tort.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal allowed the law firms appeal.

'''''Garcia v. Google, Inc.''''', 786 F.3d 733 (9th Cir. 2015), is an ongoing dispute that arose when Cindy Lee Garcia sued [[Google]] and its video-sharing website, [[YouTube]], to have the controversial film, ''[[Innocence of Muslims]]'', taken down from the site.  A California district court denied Garcia's motion for [[preliminary injunction]], but, on appeal, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the lower court's decision, ordered YouTube to take down all copies of ''Innocence of Muslims'', and remanded the case to the district court for reconsideration.&lt;ref name="CA9"&gt;[http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2014/02/28/12-57302_opinion.pdf ''Garcia v. Google''], no. 12-57302 (9th Cir. Feb. 26, 2014).  Accessed November 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2015, in an [[en banc]] opinion, the Ninth Circuit reversed the panel's decision, vacating the order for the preliminary injunction.

==Background==

=== Garcia's participation in the film===
In July 2011, Garcia auditioned for a film by writer and producer [[Mark Basseley Youssef]], also known as Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, with the working title ''Desert Warrior''.  A casting call described the film as "an HD 24P historical Arabian Desert adventure film," and Garcia was ultimately cast to play a minor role, that of a mother of a young woman who had been promised in marriage to the movie's protagonist.&lt;ref name="Lex"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=3b6ff140-49a1-4a85-9f90-b27d5987937a|title=The Garcia v. Google controversy and what it means for content owners and users|publisher=Lexology.com|accessdate=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Garcia participated in three and one-half days of shooting and was paid $500 for her work.&lt;ref name="CA9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Footnote"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Asay |first1=Clark D. |title=Ex Post Incentives and IP in Garcia v. Google and Beyond |url=http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/online/ex-post-incentives-and-ip-in-garcia-v-google-and-beyond |website=Stanford Law Review |date=August 20, 2014 |accessdate=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International reaction to ''Innocence of Muslims''===
Ultimately, Youssef used the footage from ''Desert Warrior'' to create the controversial anti-Islamic film, ''[[Innocence of Muslims]]''.&lt;ref name="Lex"/&gt;  He added the anti-Islamic content to the film by dubbing over the actors' lines without their knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5942748/it-makes-me-sick-actress-in-muhammed-movie-says-she-was-deceived-had-no-idea-it-was-about-islam |title='It Makes Me Sick': Actress in Muhammed Movie Says She Was Deceived, Had No Idea It Was About Islam |author=Adrian Chen |work=Gawker |accessdate=3 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023082359/http://gawker.com/5942748/it-makes-me-sick-actress-in-muhammed-movie-says-she-was-deceived-had-no-idea-it-was-about-islam |archivedate=23 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, Youssef had partially dubbed one of Garcia's lines in order to have her character ask, "Is your Mohammed a child molester?"&lt;ref name="CA9"/&gt;  ''Innocence of Muslims'' screened at the Vine Theater in Los Angeles, California&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/09/13/innocence-muslims-producer-identity-questioned-actors-say-were-duped/#ixzz26gzOeA5V|title='Innocence of Muslims' producer's identity in question; actors say they were duped, overdubbed|author=Hollie McKay|work=Fox News|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was uploaded to YouTube on July 1.&lt;ref name="Lat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timelines.latimes.com/unrest-timeline/|title='Innocence of Muslims' unrest|publisher=Timelines.latimes.com|accessdate=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By September 2012, Youssef had translated the film into Arabic and drew the attention of the Arabic-speaking world.&lt;ref name="Lat"/&gt;

An Egyptian cleric issued a [[fatwa]], condemning all involved with the film to death.&lt;ref name="CA9"/&gt; On September 11, 2012, a series of protests began in response to a YouTube trailer for ''Innocence of Muslims''.  While the protests began at the diplomatic mission in Cairo, Egypt, unrest quickly spread to several other countries with significant Muslim populations, including Yemen, Greece, Sudan, Tunisia, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Lat"/&gt;  Garcia herself received death threats due to her involvement with the film.&lt;ref name="CA9"/&gt;

==Lawsuit==

===District Court===
Garcia asked Google to take down the film from YouTube on eight different occasions pursuant to the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]].&lt;ref name="CA9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Footnote"/&gt;  After Google declined, Garcia sued the company in federal district court in California.  She claimed that the film's continued existence on YouTube violated her [[copyright]] interest in her performance in the film.  She applied to the court for a temporary restraining order to force Google to take down the film.&lt;ref name="Footnote"/&gt;

The district court treated Garcia's application for a temporary restraining order as an application for a preliminary injunction.  To succeed on a claim for preliminary injunction, Garcia had to show four factors: a likelihood that she would succeed on the merits of the copyright claim, the likelihood that irreparable harm will result if the court does not grant the injunction, and the balance of the equity to the parties and the public interest in granting or denying relief.  The court denied the application "because Garcia had delayed in bringing the action, had failed to demonstrate 'that the requested preliminary relief would prevent any alleged harm' and was unlikely to succeed on the merits because she'd granted Youssef an implied license to use her performance in the film."&lt;ref name="CA9"/&gt;

===U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit===
The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's decision denying Garcia a preliminary injunction, forcing Google to take down all copies of ''Innocence of Muslims'' from YouTube.  The Ninth Circuit also remanded the case for retrial on the merits of Garcia's copyright claim.

====Ninth Circuit opinion====
The Ninth Circuit held that Garcia was entitled to a preliminary injunction because she was likely to succeed on the merits of her copyright claim.  The court determined that Garcia likely owned an independent, copyrightable interest in her own performance in the film.  Specifically, the court explained that Garcia's performance was "fixed" and that her "body language, facial expression and reactions to other actors and elements of a scene" constituted sufficient originality, both requirements of the [[Copyright Act of 1976]]. Further, the court concluded that Garcia never intended to be a "joint author," so Youssef had no co-ownership of her performance in the film.

Additionally, the court determined that Garcia was not an "employee" for purposes of transferring her ownership interest in her performance under the Copyright Act.  The court pointed out that the term "employee" refers "to a hired party in a conventional employer relationship."  According to the court, because "Youssef hired Garcia for a specific task, she only worked for three days and she claims she received no health or other traditional employment benefits" suggests that she was not an "employee" under the statute. Garcia never transferred her interest in writing, either.&lt;ref name="CA9"/&gt;

On November 12, 2014, the full Ninth Circuit voted to rehear the case [[en banc]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.shadesofgraylaw.com/media/Garcia-v-Google.Order-re-Rehearing-En-Banc-00050587xA1ADA.pdf Garcia v. Google]'', no. 12-57302 (9th Cir. Nov. 12, 2014)(order).&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of that order, the court vacated its prior opinion, meaning that it can no longer be cited and is not binding on lower courts. The order has no effect on the injunction, meaning that Google still may not post the allegedly infringing portions of the film, at least for the time being.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In May 2015, in an [[en banc]] opinion, the Ninth Circuit reversed the panel's decision, vacating the order for the preliminary injunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chappell |first1=Bill|title=Google Wins Copyright And Speech Case Over 'Innocence Of Muslims' Video |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/05/18/407732594/google-wins-copyright-and-speech-case-over-innocence-of-muslims-video |accessdate=May 18, 2015 |work=NPR |date=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gardner |first1=Eriq |title=Controversial 'Innocence of Muslims' Ruling Reversed By Appeals Court |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/controversial-innocence-muslims-ruling-reversed-796530 |accessdate=May 18, 2015 |work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2015/05/18/12-57302%20EB%20opinion.pdf Garcia v. Google]'', no. 12-57302 (9th Cir. May 18, 2015)(''en banc'').&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==

===Criticism===
The Ninth Circuit's decision has sparked criticism from the legal community as well as those who produce, distribute, or host copyrighted content.&lt;ref name="Lex"/&gt;

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] ("EFF") has criticized the court's decision for several reasons. First, "the Copyright Office expressly rejected [Garcia's] effort to register a copyright," suggesting that her claim is "doubtful at best."  Second, the EFF argues that the court's decision amounts to a "prior restraint of speech, something that should never happen when the claim is 'doubtful.'"  Even worse, the EFF argues, the decision may signal that any party who has added "anything even remotely creative to a work" may have the right to receive a share in the profits of that work, and he or she may have the power to remove that work from circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/cases/garcia-v-google-inc|title=Garcia v. Google, Inc|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark D. Asay, associate professor of law at [[Brigham Young University]], reiterates some of the EFF's concerns. He suggests that the Ninth Circuit's decision could lead to censorship, wherein a small contributor to a creative work can effectively close off public access to the work.  He also argues that the decision undercuts the utilitarian purpose of copyright law.&lt;ref name="Footnote"/&gt;

Stefan M. Mentzer, a partner at White &amp; Case, LLP, argues that the court misinterpreted certain provisions of the Copyright Act.&lt;ref name="Lex"/&gt;

===Flynn v. Google===
In September 2014, Gaylor Flynn, another actor who appeared in ''Innocence of Muslims'', sued Google in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California alleging copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chung |first=Andrew |date=2014-09-15 |title=Second actor sues Google over 'Innocence of Muslims' movie trailer |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/15/us-usa-google-movie-idUSKBN0HA20420140915 |publisher=Reuters |access-date=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Founding of the IFE==
THE 1914-18 war was drawing to a close when the suggestion to form a professional
association of fire engineers was first brought forward. On 31 October 1918,
ten Chief Officers attended a meeting held at the Fire Brigade Headquarters in
Leicester for the purpose of setting up such an organisation. 
The next meeting took place on 2 January 1919, in London, when it was
announced that 40 Chief Officers had agreed to become members.
In 1924 the way was opened for an application for Incorporation to be made officially
with the blessing of all concerned. This was done immediately and at a meeting in
London on 12 February 1924, authority was given to go ahead.
The first registered office was at the offices of the Solicitors in Edinburgh and this
meant that the Institution was first registered in Scotland and has been ever since.
In the event registration in Scotland has had its disadvantages since a registered
office has had to be maintained in Scotland to this day, despite the fact that since at
least 1934 all the day-to-day work has been carried out in England.

The '''international copyright relations of Russia''' were virtually non-existent for much of the [[Russian Empire|Imperial era]] continuing into the history of the [[Soviet Union]] until the [[Cold War]]. The Russian Empire had only a few bilateral copyright treaties with other nations were concluded; these treaties moreover were weak and of short duration. The treaties from Imperial times had all expired by the time of the [[Russian Revolution]].

After the [[October Revolution]], the Soviet Union had no international copyright relations until 1967, when a first treaty with [[Hungary]] was concluded. In 1973, the USSR then joined the [[Universal Copyright Convention]] (UCC), establishing copyright relations with Western countries. More bilateral treaties followed, including two with Western countries ([[Austria]] in 1981 and [[Sweden]] in 1986), until the government announced its intention to join the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] in 1989. The USSR was dissolved before that plan could be realized. The Russian Federation acceded to the Berne Convention in 1994; the treaty entered in force in Russia on March 13, 1995.

'''International copyright treaties'''

International copyright is based on ''[[national treatment]]'': signatory countries of a treaty are obliged to grant copyright on foreign works according to their own national laws.&lt;ref name="Pilch2004_83"&gt;Pilch 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;83.&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of "classic" copyright (or ''author's rights''), three main treaties exist:
*The [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] (BC) dates to 1886 and was amended several times. It defined the minimal rights of those who produced creative scientific, literary, and artistic works, prescribing a general minimum duration of copyright of 50 years ''p.m.a.''&lt;ref name="bc_text_2_7"&gt;Berne Convention, articles 2 and 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Universal Copyright Convention]] (UCC) was adopted in 1952 (and revised in 1971) as a less stringent alternative to the BC for countries who considered the BC too demanding. If a country signed both the UCC and the BC, the BC had precedence in dealings with other BC countries.&lt;ref name="Lewinski"&gt;Lewinski&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[WIPO Copyright Treaty]] (WCT) of 1996 became effective in 2002. It was an extension of the BC covering computer programs and databases.&lt;ref name="wct"&gt;WIPO: ''[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/wct/summary_wct.html Summary of the WIPO Copyright Treaty]''. URL last accessed 2007-01-25.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the field of [[neighbouring rights]], two important treaties are:
*The [[Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations|Rome Convention]] of 1961 was the equivalent to the BC for performers, phonogram producers, and broadcasting institutions.&lt;ref name="rome_summ"&gt;WIPO: ''[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/rome/summary_rome.html Summary of the Rome Convention]''. URL last accessed 2007-01-25.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty]] (WPPT) of 1996 entered in force in 2002. It was an update on the Rome Convention.&lt;ref name="wppt_summ"&gt;WIPO: ''[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/wppt/summary_wppt.html Summary of the WPPT]''. URL last accessed 2007-01-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights|TRIPS]] agreement from 1994 defined minimum standards for the protection of intellectual property rights for [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] member countries.
&lt;/div&gt;
First international copyright treaties were concluded in Spring 1861 with [[France]] and in July 1862 with [[Belgium]]. Both treaties provided for reciprocal copyright protection, but were limited to literature only; translation rights were not covered, and censorship was explicitly allowed. Both treaties were abrogated in 1887.&lt;ref name="Elst67"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Western pressure, new treaties were concluded in 1904 with [[Germany]], in 1905 with France, and in 1906 with [[Austria-Hungary]]. After the new copyright law of 1911 was passed, new or renewed treaties were concluded with Germany (1911), France (1911), Belgium (1913/14), and [[Denmark]] (1915). All these treaties provided for reciprocal copyright protection and also included the author's translation rights, which were protected for a period of ten years from the original publication of a work.&lt;ref name="Elst70"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;70.&lt;/ref&gt; These treaties were of short duration only and expired after three to five years.&lt;ref name="Elst71"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;71.&lt;/ref&gt; Tsarist Russia even planned to join the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] in the early 20th century, but that was, according to Stoyanovitch, prevented by the outbreak of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="stoyanovitch"&gt;Stoyanovitch, K.: ''Le droit d'auteur dans les rapports entre la France et les pays socialistes'', p.&amp;nbsp;187 in Pichon, R.; Durand-Auzias, R.: ''Librairie générale de droit et de jurisprudence''; Paris 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

==USSR==
:&lt;span class="boilerplate seealso"&gt;''See also [[Copyright law of the Soviet Union#Accession to the UCC in 1973|Accession of the USSR to the UCC in 1973]]&lt;/span&gt;
After the [[October Revolution]], the Soviet Union initially had no international copyright relations at all.&lt;ref name="Elst80"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;80.&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP), the Soviet regime unsuccessfully tried to conclude new bilateral copyright treaties with [[Great Britain]], Germany, and [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Elst77"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;77.&lt;/ref&gt; After these failed attempts, the USSR maintained an isolationist policy in copyright matters until the late 1960s. A first bilateral copyright treaty with Hungary became effective on November 17, 1967, and on October 8, 1971, a second treaty with [[Bulgaria]] followed. Both treaties provided for reciprocal copyright protection with a general term of 15 years p.m.a. and also explicitly defined reciprocity for free uses.&lt;ref name="Elst80a"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;80, pointing out that Soviet works could be freely translated in Bulgaria under this reciprocity because of the freedom of translation granted by Soviet law.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newcity137ff"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;137ff, who explains that the treaty with Hungary was limited to citizens of both countries residing in these countries, works of citizens residing abroad were not covered. Newcity also explains that the reciprocity for free uses worked to the disadvantage of Soviet authors because Soviet law had broader free uses, and Soviet authors thus did not receive royalties they otherwise would have received under Hungarian or Bulgarian law.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 27, 1973, the Soviet Union deposited with the [[UNESCO]] its declaration of accession to the Geneva version of 1952 of the [[Universal Copyright Convention]] (UCC).&lt;ref name="ucc_join"&gt;[[UNESCO]]: ''[http://www.unesco.org/culture/copyright/html_eng/ucc52ms.pdf Universal Copyright Convention adopted at Geneva in 1952 and annexed Protocols 1, 2 and 3: State of ratifications, acceptances and accessions up to 1 January 2000.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625003242/http://www.unesco.org/culture/copyright/html_eng/ucc52ms.pdf |date=25 June 2008 }}'', note 29. URL last accessed 2006-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, on May 27, 1973, the UCC entered in force with respect to the USSR, establishing copyright relations with Western countries.&lt;ref name="Elst81"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;81.&lt;/ref&gt; The USSR timed its accession to the UCC to occur before the 1971 Paris version of the UCC entered in force.&lt;ref name="Elst82a"&gt;Elst,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;82, footnote 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the Paris version had become effective, accessions to the earlier Geneva version were no longer possible. The USSR would then have been forced to implement the somewhat stronger provisions of the 1971 Paris version, which in particular explicitly recognized an author's exclusive rights to reproduction, performance, and broadcast of a work.&lt;ref name="Elst82a"/&gt; Such neighbouring rights did not exist in Soviet law.

With the [[Copyright law of the Soviet Union#Accession to the UCC in 1973|accession of the Soviet Union to the UCC]], Soviet works published on or after May 27, 1973 became eligible to copyright in all other signatory countries of the UCC. Conversely, foreign works became copyrighted in the Soviet Union by virtue of the UCC if they were published on or after May 27, 1973 and the publication occurred in a UCC country or the author was a citizen of a UCC country.&lt;ref name="Elst83"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;83.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were initially fears in the West that the Soviet authorities could misuse the provisions of the UCC to censor undesirable works abroad: the regime could compulsorily purchase the copyright on such works without the authors' consent and then sue in foreign courts against the publication of Soviet works abroad, since the copyright would be owned by the state.&lt;ref name="Newcity151ff"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;151ff.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this did not occur. Evidently, the Soviet authorities considered the measures provided by its other laws&amp;mdash;in particular articles 70 and 190(1) of the RSFSR Criminal Code on [[anti-Soviet agitation]]&lt;ref name="Elst50_51"&gt;Elst, p.&amp;nbsp;50&amp;ndash;51. Article 190(1) was introduced in 1966 in the Criminal Code of the RSFSR, after the trial against [[Andrei Sinyavsky]] and [[Yuli Daniel]], in which the prosecution had found it difficult to prove the intent to do harm that was required by article 70. The new article 190(1) made the "dissemination of known falsehoods that defame the Soviet political and social system" a criminal offense and didn't stipulate any intention at all. Similar provisions existed in the other republics' laws.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;sufficient to deal with [[dissident]]s without needing to resort to actions based on the copyright law. Furthermore, such actions would have badly damaged the prestige of the USSR abroad, and it was doubtful whether foreign countries would have honored such nationalizations.&lt;ref name="Elst84a"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;84, pointing out that French courts denied any effect in France of the nationalizations in 1919 of the works of 17 Russian composers.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. included in its [[Copyright law of the United States|Copyright law]] of 1976 an article 201(e) that explicitly invalidated all involuntary transfers of copyright. This provision was included in the U.S. [[Copyright Act of 1976]] precisely to prevent attempts of the Soviet government to employ the UCC to censor dissidents' works in the U.S.&lt;ref name="nimmer"&gt;Nimmer, M.B.; Nimmer, D.: ''Nimmer on Copyright'', §10.04 at 10-56.5. On November 6, 1978, [[:s:United States Code/Title 17/Chapter 2/Sections 201 and 202|17 U.S.C. 201(e)]] was amended by adding "except as provided under title 11". [[:s:United States Code/Title 11|Title 11]] of the [[United States Code]] covers [[bankruptcy]].&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;although no such attempts had occurred yet and didn't occur afterwards.&lt;ref name="Elst85"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite having joined the UCC, the Soviet Union continued its policy of bilateral agreements. New treaties with the [[German Democratic Republic]] (effective November 21, 1973), [[Poland]] (October 4, 1974), and [[Czechoslovakia]] (March 18, 1975) were concluded. The 1967 treaty with Hungary had already been prolonged in 1971 and was again renewed in 1977, the treaty with Bulgaria was renewed in 1975.&lt;ref name="Elst80"/&gt; The treaties with Hungary and Czechoslovakia also included a provision for the protection of the moral rights "without limitation in time".&lt;ref name="Elst606"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;606.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, the first bilateral treaty with a Western country was signed: the copyright treaty with [[Austria]] entered in force on December 16, 1981.&lt;ref name="Dittrich"&gt;Dittrich&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;760&amp;ndash;768.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elst89f"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;89f.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 30, 1985, a treaty with [[Cuba]] followed,&lt;ref name="Elst495"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;495.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1986 the second treaty with a Western country was concluded with [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="Elst367a"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;367, pointing out that the treaty with Sweden explicitly also covered photographic works and also included the protection of the moral rights.&lt;/ref&gt; All these post-UCC treaties went beyond the provisions of the UCC because they were applied retroactively&lt;ref name="Elst90"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;90.&lt;/ref&gt; and explicitly applied also to works published ''before'' the USSR had joined the UCC and that were still copyrighted in their source country in 1973.&lt;ref name="Gavrilov1987"&gt;Gavrilov, E. P.: ''Lettre de l'U.R.S.S.: Evolution récente du droit d'auteur soviétique'', pp.&amp;nbsp;226&amp;ndash;246 in ''Le Droit d'Auteur'' 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; (The treaty with Austria was amended to cover such pre-1973 works in 1989.&lt;ref name="Elst367"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;367.&lt;/ref&gt;) On April 19, 1989, another copyright treaty with [[Madagascar]] was concluded.&lt;ref name="Gavrilov1990"&gt;Gavrilov, E. P.: ''Lettre de l'U.R.S.S.: Evolution récente du droit d'auteur soviétique'', pp.&amp;nbsp;364&amp;ndash;380 in ''Le Droit d'Auteur'' 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty with the German Democratic Republic was rescinded by the USSR on June 2, 1991, following confusions about its continued applicability after the [[German reunification]].&lt;ref name="Elst367"/&gt;

On October 20, 1988, the USSR acceded to the [[Brussels Convention (Satellite transmissions)|Brussels Convention]] about measures against the unauthorized (re-)distribution of satellite transmissions. The treaty became effective for Russia from January 20, 1989 on.&lt;ref name="brussels"&gt;WIPO: ''[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/Remarks.jsp?cnty_id=1238C Brussels Convention &amp;ndash; Contracting Parties: Details &amp;ndash; Russian Federation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030123939/http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/Remarks.jsp?cnty_id=1238C |date=2007-10-30 }}''. URL last accessed 2007-01-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1989, the Soviet government announced its intention to join the Berne Convention, but the USSR was dissolved before that plan could be realized.&lt;ref name="Elst367"/&gt;

The changing economy in the Soviet Union led to the conclusion of a trade treaty between the USSR and the [[United States]], signed by presidents Gorbachev and [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] on June 1, 1990. In this treaty, the U.S. imposed a number of measures in the field of intellectual property in exchange for granting the USSR [[most favoured nation|most-favoured-nation]] status.&lt;ref name="Elst349"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;349.&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty obliged the USSR to accede to the Berne Convention and to implement in its law a neighbouring rights scheme similar to what the Rome Convention laid down.&lt;ref name="Elst350"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;350.&lt;/ref&gt; The USSR agreed in the treaty to take substantive steps to amend its legislation in that sense by 1991.&lt;ref name="Elst351"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;351.&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty was ratified by the U.S. on December 23, 1991. The Soviet side no longer could do so, but the Russian Federation did so on June 12, 1992.&lt;ref name="Elst350"/&gt;&lt;ref name="circ38a"&gt;The U.S. concluded similar agreements with the other successor states of the USSR, see ''Circular 38a'' of the U.S. Copyright Office.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian Federation==
When the Soviet Union was dissolved, Russia as the largest successor state adopted all international obligations of the former USSR, including its membership to the UCC.&lt;ref name="Elst485"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;485.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Russia was henceforth considered a member of the UCC (in the 1952 Geneva text) since the date of the adherence of the USSR to that treaty, i.e., since May 27, 1973.&lt;ref name="ucc_join"/&gt; The membership of the USSR in the Brussels Convention was equally continued by the Russian Federation as from December 25, 1991.&lt;ref name="brussels"/&gt;

On June 25, 1993, Russia and [[Armenia]] signed a treaty on the mutual protection of copyrights.&lt;ref name="Elst388"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;388.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elst496"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;496.&lt;/ref&gt; To clarify the copyright situation amongst the states that had made up the former Soviet Union, the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) nations agreed on a cooperation agreement in the field of copyrights on September 24, 1993. This "Moscow agreement" declared that all signatory countries considered themselves bound by the UCC as of the date the USSR had joined and would confirm this state with the [[UNESCO]], which administered the UCC.&lt;ref name="Elst486a"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;486. Both the UNESCO and the U.S. Copyright Office consider all CIS nations to be UCC (1952) members as of May 27, 1973. See U.S. Copyright Office, ''Circular 38a''.&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty also defined that the treaty states would apply the UCC amongst themselves, also for works published before May 27, 1973 if those works had been copyrighted before this date according to the national laws of the successor states. This provision was subject to the [[rule of the shorter term]]. The intent of the Moscow agreement was to avoid that older Soviet works became copyrighted in only some of the successor states, but would become part of the public domain in some of the others.&lt;ref name="Elst487"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;487.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1993 Moscow agreement entered in force in Russia on May 6, 1995.&lt;ref name="tacis"&gt;Lyapin &amp; Paliashvili.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same year, Russia and [[Switzerland]] concluded a trade agreement in which they granted each other most-favoured-nation status concerning intellectual property rights, i.e., they agreed to grant the other treaty partner automatically and without conditions any trade advantage they'd grant a third country.&lt;ref name="Elst344"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;344.&lt;/ref&gt; This treaty entered in force on July 1, 1995.&lt;ref name="Elst353f"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;353f.&lt;/ref&gt; In a comprehensive trade treaty with the [[European Union]] that was signed on June 24, 1994,&lt;ref name="Elst344"/&gt; Russia granted this most-favoured-nation status also to the EU member countries, excepting only trade advantages granted amongst the successor states of the USSR and also those Russia would grant a third country on an effective reciprocal basis.&lt;ref name="Elst345f"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;345f. "Effective reciprocal basis" means advantages granted by Russia to a third country only because this third country granted similar advantages to Russia in a bilateral treaty.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ratification of this treaty was delayed as it had to be ratified by all EU members, an interim agreement containing only the provisions on intellectual property and the most-favoured-nation status was signed on July 17, 1995. It entered in force on February 1, 1996.&lt;ref name="Elst347"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;347.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 1994, the Russian government announced that the country would join three international treaties in the field of copyrights: the 1971 Paris version of the UCC including its annexes, the [[Geneva Phonograms Convention]] on unauthorized duplication and [[parallel import]] of phonograms, and the Berne Convention.&lt;ref name="berne_decree"&gt;Russian Federation; decree no. 1224 from 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The accession documents to all three treaties were deposited on December 9, 1994. The UCC (Paris 1971 version) became effective for Russia on March 9, 1995.&lt;ref name="ucc_1971"&gt;UNESCO: ''[http://www.unesco.org/culture/copyright/html_eng/ucc71ms.pdf Universal Copyright Convention as revised at Paris on 24 July 1971 and annexed Protocols 1 and 2: State of ratifications, acceptances and accessions up to 1 January 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110084658/http://www.unesco.org/culture/copyright/html_eng/ucc71ms.pdf |date=10 November 2006 }}''.

===Berne Convention===
The Berne Convention also became effective for Russia on March 13, 1995.&lt;ref name="bc_join"&gt;[[WIPO]]: ''[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/Remarks.jsp?cnty_id=1017C Contracting Parties - Berne Convention - Russian Federation - Details] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515223606/http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/Remarks.jsp?cnty_id=1017C |date=2006-05-15 }}'', URL last accessed 2007-01-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The Berne Convention ''is'' retroactive in principle:&lt;ref name="Elst489"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;489.&lt;/ref&gt; according to its article 18, it applies to all works that are copyrighted in their source country (the country where the first publication of the work occurred) on the day the treaty enters in force with respect to a joining country such as Russia. Article 18(2) adds that if "through the expiry of the term of protection which was previously granted, a work has fallen into the public domain of the country where protection is claimed, that work shall not be protected anew."&lt;ref name="bc_text_18"&gt;Berne Convention, article 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence works that were copyrighted in Russia on March 13, 1995 became copyrighted in all other Berne Countries on that date.&lt;ref name="Elst535"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;535.&lt;/ref&gt; Under these provisions, foreign works not formerly copyrighted in Russia should also have become copyrighted in Russia.&lt;ref name="Elst493"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;493.&lt;/ref&gt; Russian legal scholars had warned of this, and the government feared the impacts on the trade balance with Western countries if Russian publishers would suddenly have to pay royalties for foreign works.&lt;ref name="Elst489"/&gt; In its declaration of accession, Russia therefore made a reservation regarding article 18 of the Berne Convention, stating that the treaty "shall not extend to the works which, at the date of entry into force of the said Convention in respect of the Russian Federation, are already in the public domain in its territory."&lt;ref name="berne_decree"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bc_reservation"&gt;WIPO: ''Berne Notification 162.''&lt;/ref&gt; For Russian and Soviet work that originated in Russia, this was just a restatement of article 18(1) of the Berne Convention; but as far as foreign works were concerned, this reservation effectively denied the retroactivity of the Berne Convention within Russia.&lt;ref name="Elst493"/&gt; This was of some importance because of the issue of foreign works published before May 27, 1973, when the USSR had joined the UCC. Such works had never been eligible to copyright in the Soviet Union or in Russia. Under §18(2) of the Berne Convention, they should have become copyrighted in 1995 because that article only exempted works that once ''were'' copyrighted, but on which that copyright already had expired, which didn't apply to pre-1973 foreign works in Russia.&lt;ref name="Elst493"/&gt; The reservation made by Russia used a slightly different phrasing, just stating that works that were in the [[public domain]] in Russia in 1995 would not be reprotected. As pre-1973 foreign works were not copyrighted at all and thus in the public domain in Russia in 1995, such works remained in the public domain in Russia.&lt;ref name="Elst493"/&gt; Russia thus got rather favorable conditions when it joined Berne Convention: Russian and Soviet works became copyrighted retroactively in other Berne countries, but pre-1973 works from those other countries did ''not'' become copyrighted in Russia.&lt;ref name="Elst494"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elst535"/&gt;

This Russian interpretation was heavily criticized by Western countries and in particular by the [[United States]]. Russian scholars, however, repeatedly (and, in the opinion of Elst, rightly&lt;ref name="Elst489"/&gt;) pointed out that there had been a very prominent precedent:&lt;ref name="podshibikhin"&gt;Podshibikhin &amp; Leontiev 2002 explain the argument presented here using the 1995 case of ''[[Itar-Tass v. Russian Kurier]]'' as an example. After defending the Russian practice, Podshibikhin &amp; Leontiev then express the opinion that the continued application of the non-retroactivity reservation was becoming a problem in Russia's international relations and were better ended. They then explain the necessary modifications of the 1993 law to introduce the copyright restoration as it is prescribed by the Berne Convention. Their proposed modifications coincide with the changes that were indeed made in 2004 by law no. 72-FL.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1989, when the U.S. had joined the Berne Convention, they ''also'' had denied the retroactivity of the treaty.&lt;ref name="Elst491"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;491.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1989 until 1995, the U.S. only respected the copyrights under the Berne Convention on foreign works from another country that were published on or after the later of that country's adherence date to the Berne Convention and March 1, 1989 (the adherence date of U.S.),&lt;ref name="wipo_us"&gt;WIPO: ''[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ShowResults.jsp?country_id=179C&amp;start_year=ANY&amp;end_year=ANY&amp;search_what=C&amp;treaty_all=ALL Contracting Parties: United States of America]''. URL last accessed 2007-01-23.&lt;/ref&gt; and on foreign works from a UCC country according to the provisions of the UCC, which meant on works that were published after the later of September 16, 1955 (the date the UCC entered in force for the U.S. and the other initial signatories)&lt;ref name="ucc_join"/&gt; and the adherence date of the foreign UCC country.&lt;ref name="regnier"&gt;Regnier&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;400ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Russian or Soviet works, this meant that until 1996, the U.S. continued to recognize only copyrights on Soviet works published after May 27, 1973.&lt;ref name ="Pilch2003_83"&gt;Pilch 2003,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;83.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. faced harsh critique for its unilateral denouncement of the retroactivity of the Berne Convention defined in article 18(1) BC.&lt;ref name="Elst491"/&gt; Ultimately, the U.S. had to reverse its position on that issue. It implemented the [[TRIPS]] agreement (a precondition to becoming a [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] member) in its [[Uruguay Round Agreements Act]] (URAA), which was signed into law on December 8, 1994. The URAA effectively restored the copyright in the U.S. on foreign works on January 1, 1996, if those works were until then not copyrighted in the U.S. because of a failure to meet the U.S.  [[copyright formalities|formalities]] (such as not bearing a [[copyright notice]], or lacking [[copyright registration|registration]] with the U.S. Copyright Office) or because of a lack of international treaties between the U.S. and the source country of the work, if the work was still copyrighted in its source country on January 1, 1996.&lt;ref name="Pilch2003_84"&gt;Pilch 2003,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;84. The copyright restoration provisions of the URAA are contained in [[:s:United States Code/Title 17/Chapter 1/Section 104A|17 U.S.C. 104A]] in the copyright law of the U.S.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="circ38b"&gt;See also Circular 38b of the [[U.S. Copyright Office]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian scholars have disputed this retroactivity issue at length. Gavrilov, for instance, who had argued for the Russian reservation to the Berne Convention,&lt;ref name="Elst489"/&gt; kept defending it, while others disagreed.&lt;ref name="bookseller"&gt;Russian Association of Book Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; Maggs and Sergeyev, for instance, pointed out in 2000 that the reservation was inadmissible under article 30(1) of the Berne Convention;&lt;ref name="maggs"&gt;Maggs &amp; Sergeyev, chapter 7, section E.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Podshibikhin and Leontiev agreed in 2002.&lt;ref name="podshibikhin_2"&gt;Podshibikhin &amp; Leontiev 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  The modification of the copyright law through law 72-FL in 2004 refuelled the discussion, because this law added a new paragraph 4 to article 5 of the 1993 copyright law which clearly stated under which conditions foreign works were copyrighted in Russia, using a wording that corresponded in essence to articles 18(1) ''and'' 18(2) of the Berne Convention.&lt;ref name="law2004_2"&gt;Law no. 72-{{lang|ru|ФЗ}} of 2004, chapter 1, article 2 (modifying article 5 of the copyright law). Furthermore, copyrights on foreign works were made subject to the [[rule of the shorter term]]. Compare also Podshibikhin &amp; Leontiev, who had in 2002 proposed exactly such a modification (albeit without a rule of the shorter term) to end the Russian non-retroactivity reservation.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Gavrilov continued arguing in favour of the non-protection of pre-1973 foreign works, arguing that this was not so much a reservation to the Berne Convention but merely an interpretation, whereas others considered the 2004 amendments to finally do away with this reservation and claimed that law 72-FL restored copyright in Russia on pre-1973 foreign works.&lt;ref name="bookseller"/&gt; According to the Russian representative at the negotiations on Russia's accession to the WTO, law 72-FL indeed was intended to rescind the non-retroactivity reservation, thereby restoring copyrights on pre-1973 foreign works.&lt;ref name="wto_acc_rus"&gt;WTO, ''Report of the Working Party on the Accession of the Russian Federation to the World Trade Organization'';p.&amp;nbsp;318, paragraph 1242.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian copyright law (already before 2004) also considered international treaties self-executing and to take precedence over the Russian law (article 3).&lt;ref name="Pilch2004_85"&gt;Pilch 2004,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;85.&lt;/ref&gt; The common practice in Russia nevertheless did not change; pre-1973 foreign works were commonly considered to be uncopyrighted in Russia due to this reservation.&lt;ref name="budylin8"&gt;Budylin &amp; Osipova,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;8, still stated in January 2007 that pre-1973 foreign works were uncopyrighted in Russia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other treaties===
In 2003, Russia also joined the [[Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations|Rome Convention]], the analogue of the Berne Convention for [[neighbouring rights]]. The adherence of Russia to the Rome Convention became effective on May 26, 2003.&lt;ref name="russ_treaties"&gt;[[WIPO]]: ''[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ShowResults.jsp?country_id=147C&amp;start_year=ANY&amp;end_year=ANY&amp;search_what=C&amp;treaty_all=ALL Contracting Parties: Russian Federation]''. URL last accessed 2007-01-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rome convention covered performances, phonograms, and broadcasts. For phonograms, it stipulated that phonograms produced by a national of a contracting state, or fixated in a contracting state, or published in a contracting state were covered, but allowed signatory countries to choose among the latter two (article 5).&lt;ref name="rome_text"&gt;WIPO: ''[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/rome/trtdocs_wo024.html International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organizations done at Rome on October 26, 1961]''.

==International copyright==
The international copyright relations of the Soviet Union and of Russia gave rise to copyright on Soviet works abroad and also to some foreign works becoming copyrighted in the USSR or in Russia. In some cases, Soviet works even became copyrighted in other countries in the absence of any international copyright treaties.

===Copyright on foreign works in the USSR and in Russia===
Prior to the accession of the Soviet Union to the UCC, only works by foreign authors that were first published in the USSR and unpublished works of foreign authors that existed in an objective form on the territory of the USSR were eligible to copyright.&lt;ref name="Newcity53"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;53.&lt;/ref&gt; When the USSR joined the UCC in 1973 and the treaty entered in force with respect to the USSR on May 27, 1973, foreign works first published on or after that date outside of the USSR became copyrighted in the Soviet Union if
*the author was a national of any other signatory country of the UCC, irrespective of where this publication occurred, or if
*the work was first published in any other UCC country, regardless of the nationality of the author.&lt;ref name="Elst83"/&gt;

In addition to the UCC, the bilateral treaties the USSR concluded with several countries, amongst them also two Western countries, made works of nationals of these countries eligible for copyright in the Soviet Union, even works published before May 27, 1973. In the case of Austria, Poland, and Sweden, this even applied to any work first published there, irrespective of the nationality of the author.&lt;ref name="Elst89f"/&gt;

Since its accession to the Berne Convention in 1995, the following foreign works were copyrighted in Russia:
* Soviet works published in the Russian SFSR, as well as works of authors who became citizens of the Russian federation after the demise of the USSR became subject to the copyright law of the Russian Federation of 1993 (and its amendments) due to the strict territoriality of copyright law.&lt;ref name="Elst485a"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;485; see also §5 of the 1993 Copyright law, covering works of Russian citizens and works "disclosed on the territory of the Russian Federation", which coincides with the territory of the former RSFSR.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Soviet works that were first published in one of the other fourteen republics of the USSR and created by authors who did not become nationals of the Russian Federation were subject to the Russian copyright law per the Moscow agreement.&lt;ref name="Elst487"/&gt;
* Works by nationals of countries that adhered to the Berne Convention, but not to the UCC, or works published in such a country, became eligible to copyright in Russia if they were published on or after March 13, 1995, the date the Berne Convention became effective with respect to Russia.&lt;ref name="Elst493"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gavrilov_comments"&gt;Gavrilov 1999, comment 6 to article 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Works of nationals of UCC countries, or works first published in such a country (regardless of the author's nationality), were subject to copyright in Russia if the works were first published on or after May 27, 1973. Because of the Russian reservation concerning the retroactivity of the Berne Convention,&lt;ref name="bc_reservation"/&gt; this applied whether or not the UCC country had also signed the Berne Convention.&lt;ref name="Elst493"/&gt;
* Pre-1973 works of nationals of one of the countries the USSR or Russia concluded bilateral treaties with were subject to copyright in Russia insofar as these treaties remained effective. This concerned works of nationals of Austria, Armenia,&lt;ref name="Elst388"/&gt; Bulgaria, Cuba, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Madagascar, Poland, Slovakia, and Sweden, regardless of the place of first publication.&lt;ref name="gavrilov_comments"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elst494f"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;494f.&lt;/ref&gt; It also applied generally to works first published in Austria, Poland, or Sweden, regardless of the author's nationality, as the bilateral treaties with these states explicitly stated so.&lt;ref name="Elst496"/&gt;

Pre-1973 foreign works of other countries initially were not covered by copyright in Russia. That changed with federal law 72-FL of August 8, 2004,&lt;ref name="law2004_2"/&gt; which brought the Russian copyright law in full compliance with the Berne Convention. Since then, foreign works subject to the Berne Convention are copyrighted in Russia if they were copyrighted in the source country when Russia joined the Berne convention (''i.e.'', in 1995).&lt;ref name="bookseller"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wto_acc_rus"/&gt; Russia implements the [[rule of the shorter term]]:&lt;ref name="law2004_2"/&gt; the copyright term of a foreign work in Russia is the shorter of the copyright term in the source country and the normal 70-years ''p.m.a.'' accorded by Russian law. This situation remained unchanged with the entry in force of the new Part IV of the Russian Civil Code which included a complete rewrite of the copyright law; article 1256 embodies the amendments from law 72-FL.&lt;ref name="law2008_230_fl"&gt;Law 230-{{lang|ru|ФЗ}} of December 18, 2006; article 1256.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright on Soviet and Russian works in other countries===
Even before the accession of the Soviet Union to the UCC in 1973, some Soviet works were copyrighted in some other countries.&lt;ref name="Newcity34"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;34.&lt;/ref&gt; One well-known case concerned the actions of the four Soviet composers [[Dimitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[Aram Khachaturian|Khachaturian]], [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]], and [[Nikolai Myaskovsky|Myaskovsky]] against the movie company [[20th Century Fox]]. 20th Century Fox had published a movie called ''The Iron Curtain'', using music of these four composers as background music and crediting the composers. The four Soviet composers initiated legal actions against the movie company, claiming that the use of their names and music in a movie whose theme was objectionable to them and that was unsympathetic to the Soviet ideology&lt;ref name="standler"&gt;Standler, quoting from ''Shostakovich v. 20th Century-Fox'', 80 N.Y.S.2d 575, at 578&amp;ndash;579.&lt;/ref&gt; [[libel]]ed them and violated their civil rights.&lt;ref name="Newcity34"/&gt; In the U.S., the courts dismissed these claims in ''[[Shostakovich v. Twentieth Century-Fox]]'' ([[Case citation|80 N.Y.S.2d 575]] (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1948), affirmed, 87 N.Y.S.2d 430 (N.Y. App. Div. 1949)), in particular because the works of these composers were in the public domain in the U.S. at that time because there were no international treaties relating to copyright between the U.S. and the USSR. The compositions themselves also had not been distorted, so the court found that the composers' moral right to the integrity of the work was not violated.

The four plaintiffs also went to court over this issue in France. Up to 1964, the French legislation treated both French authors and foreign authors exactly the same; works of both were granted exactly the same copyright protection.&lt;ref name="Newcity35"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt; In a lawsuit that was ultimately decided by the [[Court of Cassation (France)|French Court of Cassation]] in 1959,&lt;ref name="paris_1959"&gt;''{{lang|fr|Société Fox, Europe v. Société Le Chant du Monde}}'', D. Jur 93 (1960), 1959 J.C.P. II11580 ({{lang|fr|Cour de Cassation}}). ''"{{lang|fr|Société Le Chant du Monde}}"'' was the rights holder in France on these Soviet composer's works.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[plaintiff]]s won: the court ruled that works of foreign authors were entitled to copyright in France, and that the works of these four Soviet composers were thus copyrighted in France. It found their moral rights violated and ordered the film to be confiscated.&lt;ref name="Newcity35"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gigante"&gt;Gigante 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way by which Soviet works could become copyrighted outside of the Soviet Union was the smuggling of manuscripts out of the USSR to have the work first published abroad. This practice, known as ''[[Samizdat|tamizdat]]'' in the Soviet Union, could result in serious repercussions for the authors in the USSR, but was still employed as one of the few ways the governmental [[censorship]] could be bypassed. As a side effect, ''tamizdat'' works were granted copyright in the foreign country of first publication. If that country was a signatory of the UCC or the Berne Convention, the work was also granted copyright in all other signatories of these treaties, because they both extended copyright to works of citizens of non-member states, if these works were first published in a member state.&lt;ref name="Newcity36"&gt;Newcity&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elst33"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt; A very famous case of a ''tamizdat'' publication was [[Boris Pasternak]]'s novel ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'', which, after it had been refused by Soviet publishers,&lt;ref name="Elst42"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;42.&lt;/ref&gt; was first published in an Italian translation in [[Italy]] in 1957. Because Italy was a member of both the UCC and the Berne Convention, the work was entitled to full copyright in all other member states of these two conventions.&lt;ref name="Newcity36"/&gt; Pasternak was expelled from the [[USSR Union of Writers|Writers' Union]] and, after he had been awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1958, forced to decline acceptance of the award.&lt;ref name="Elst42"/&gt;

Early Soviet authors sometimes benefited from international copyright on their works just naturally. [[Maxim Gorky]] and [[Sergei Prokofiev]], for instance, both had lived for some time abroad and published works in other countries that were members of the Berne Convention. These works of theirs were copyrighted in all other signatory countries of the Berne Convention.&lt;ref name="Newcity36"/&gt; After the case of ''Doctor Zhivago'', Soviet publishers became more aware of this possibility to have Soviet works covered by the Berne Convention. Soviet state organizations began to arrange for (simultaneous) first publication of some Soviet works in a country of the Berne Convention. For instance, [[Mikhail Sholokov]]'s novel ''They Fought for Their Country'' was officially first published in Italy.&lt;ref name="Newcity36"/&gt;

When the Soviet Union joined to the UCC, all Soviet works published on or after May 27, 1973 became eligible to copyright in all other signatory countries of the UCC. This state persisted until the dissolution of the USSR. When the USSR disintegrated, so did its copyright law. The split into fifteen independent states translated into a split into fifteen independent copyright laws, each with its own jurisdiction defined by the territory of the new successor state of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Elst487"/&gt; Through the Moscow agreement, Soviet works first published in the RSFSR, which were thus subject to the Russian law, became eligible for copyright is all other CIS nations, even if they had been published before 1973.&lt;ref name="Elst487"/&gt;

Since its accession to the Berne Convention in 1995, the following Russian and Soviet works were copyrighted outside of Russia:
* All works copyrighted in Russia in 1995, when Russia joined the Berne Convention, became copyrighted in other Berne countries.&lt;ref name="Elst535"/&gt; By virtue of the retroactivity of the Russian copyright law of 1993, this also included many pre-1973 Soviet works,&lt;ref name="Elst532ff"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;532ff.&lt;/ref&gt; namely all works published in 1945 or later and also older works of authors who died or were rehabilitated in 1945 or later (or 1941 for authors who lived during the Great Patriotic War), if these works were first published in the Russian SFSR (or later in Russia) or the author had become a citizen of the Russian Federation after the demise of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Elst481"&gt;Elst&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;481.&lt;/ref&gt;
* All works copyrighted in Russia on January 1, 1996, the effective date of the U.S. Uruguay Round Agreements Act, became copyrighted in the U.S. on that date. This essentially concerned all the same works as above, but using the years 1946 or 1942 instead of 1945 and 1941, respectively.&lt;ref name="Pilch2003_86"&gt;Pilch 2003,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ascap"&gt;See e.g. [[ASCAP]]'s list of [http://www.ascap.com/restored_works/restore_index.cfm compositions whose copyright was restored] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311225918/http://www.ascap.com/restored_works/restore_index.cfm |date=2007-03-11 }} in 1996 by the URAA. URL last accessed 2007-01-25.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the countries that had bilateral treaties with the USSR, pre-1973 Soviet works (from any of the fifteen SSRs) were copyrighted even before.&lt;ref name="Elst495"/&gt;

'''International judicial institutions''' can be divided into [[court]]s, arbitral [[tribunal]]s and [[Quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]] institutions. Courts are permanent bodies, with near the same composition for each case. Arbitral tribunals, by contrast, are constituted anew for each case. Both courts and arbitral tribunals can make binding decisions. Quasi-judicial institutions, by contrast, make rulings on cases, but these rulings are not in themselves legally binding; the main example is the individual complaints mechanisms available under the various UN human rights treaties.

Institutions can also be divided into global and regional institutions.

The listing below incorporates both currently existing institutions, defunct institutions that no longer exist, institutions which never came into existence due to non-ratification of their constitutive instruments, and institutions which do not yet exist, but for which constitutive instruments have been signed.

[[File:Palazzo Montecitorio Rom 2009.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[Palazzo Montecitorio]], seat of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] of the [[Italian Republic]], one of the two branches of the Parliament.]]
The '''Italian electoral law of 2015''', better known as '''Italicum''',&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/atto/serie_generale/caricaDettaglioAtto/originario?atto.dataPubblicazioneGazzetta=2015-05-08&amp;atto.codiceRedazionale=15G00066&amp;elenco30giorni=true {{lang|it|LEGGE 6 maggio 2015, n. 52}}].&lt;/ref&gt; a name given to it in 2014 by the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] secretary and subsequently [[President of the Council of Ministers (Italy)|head of government]] [[Matteo Renzi]], who was its main proponent (until the end of January 2015 with the support of [[Forza Italia]]'s leader [[Silvio Berlusconi]]) provides for a [[two-round system]] based on [[party-list proportional representation]] (the former being ruled out as unconstitutional),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Italicum run-off KO'd, bonus OK'd|url=http://www.ansa.it/english/news/politics/2017/01/25/italicum-run-off-kod-bonus-okd_2c243c33-e49e-4758-bed0-01ea38bd6ee3.html|website=ANSA English}}&lt;/ref&gt; corrected by a [[majority bonus]] and a 3% [[election threshold]]. Candidates run for election in 100 multi-member [[constituency|constituencies]] with [[open list]]s, except for a single candidate chosen by each party who is the first to be elected. 

The law, which came into force on 1 July 2016, regulates the election of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]], replacing the [[#Porcellum (2005-2015)|previous electoral law]] of 2005, modified by the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Constitutional Court]] in December 2013 after judging it partly unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://www.camera.it/leg17/465?tema=riforma_elettorale] {{lang|it|Riforma elettorale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law was written under the assumption that, by the time it came into force, the [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|upper house]] would have become an indirectly-elected body representing [[regions of Italy|regions]], with greatly reduced powers, thus making a reform of its electoral system unnecessary. The upper-house reform, rejected in [[Italian constitutional referendum, 2016|the 4 December 2016 Constitutional Referendum]], was originally assumed to be adopted without a Referendum by 1 July 2016. 

It is the first electoral law, which even if it was approved by the Italian Parliament, has never been used in a general election.
 
== History ==
{{See also|Scorporo}}
The electoral law passed by the centre-right government in 2005, immediately received widespread criticism: among other things, critics called into question the use of long [[closed list]]s of candidates (which gave party executives great power in deciding the composition of the Parliament), and the regional mechanism of allocation of seats in the Senate (which made the existence of a "clear winner" of the elections less likely).

After two unsuccessful attempts at repealing the law by referendum, in the [[Italian general election, 2013|2013 general election]] the law failed to produce a majority in the Senate: as a consequence, the only way to form a government was by means of a [[grand coalition]] between left wing and right wing parties that had harshly fought each other in the election. The resulting [[Letta Cabinet]] was perceived by many people as the second "unelected government" in a row (after the [[Monti Cabinet]]).

While the coalition agreed that a new electoral law was needed, it failed to agree on a specific model. The Democratic Party executive and prime minister [[Enrico Letta]] even went as far as requesting that his party vote against a parliamentary initiative by fellow democrat [[Roberto Giachetti]] to restore the previous Mattarella law. This was probably done out of concern that the grand coalition supporting his government would not hold.

On 4 December 2013, the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Constitutional Court]] judged the electoral law of 2005 partly unconstitutional: in particular, its unlimited [[majority bonus]] was repealed. This made an electoral reform ever more urgent, since proportional representation without majoritarian correction is thought to be incompatible with the competitive party system of Italy.

A few days after, on 8 December 2013, [[Matteo Renzi]] became the new leader of the Democratic Party. In his victory speech, he vowed to change the electoral law against the risk of "''stabilized grand coalitions''". Renzi's initiative ultimately led to him taking the place of Letta as the prime minister. Finally, Renzi made a deal with [[Silvio Berlusconi]] for a set of institutional reforms, including a new majority-assuring law based on a two-round system, conceived to make the event of a forced Grand Coalition impossible.

The bill still faced harsh opposition, even by members of the proposing parties: however it was approved by the Chamber of Deputies on 12 March 2014 and, in an amended form, by the Senate on 27 January 2015 with the support of a large majority.

After the election of [[Sergio Mattarella]] as the new President of Italy on 31 January 2015, Berlusconi withdrew his support to the bill. In order for it to receive its final approval by the Chamber of Deputies, the government decided to link it to a confidence vote (hinting at a [[snap election]] in case of a negative outcome). The bill was finally approved on 4 May 2015 and signed by President Mattarella two days later.

== Main characteristics and operation ==
The Italicum system regulates the attribution of 617 of the 630 seats of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]], excluding 12 seats attributed to representatives of Italians living abroad, and one seat for the [[Aosta Valley]] region. An uncommon feature of this system is that it is ''majority assuring'', thanks to a [[majority bonus|jackpot]] that is assigned to the winning party, possibly after a second electoral round.

The territory of Italy is divided into 100 [[constituency|constituencies]] electing between 3 and 9 deputies depending on their size. For each constituency, the parties designate a list of candidates: "head of list" candidates can run in up to 10 constituencies, while other candidates are limited to a single constituency. Gender balance is promoted by requiring that, in each [[Regions of Italy|region]], head of lists of either sex for the same party should not exceed 60% of the total; additionally, candidates in all lists must be in a sequence alternating by gender.

At the first round, electors receive a ballot allowing them to vote for a single party and for its head of list candidate (pre-printed on the ballot), and are given the option to express up to two additional [[open list|preference votes]] for other candidates of that party, by writing their name next to the party symbol. If two preference votes are expressed, they must be of a different sex: otherwise, the second preference is discarded.

Only parties passing a 3% minimum threshold in the first round are assigned seats. If the party receiving the plurality of the votes passes a 40% threshold, it is attributed a minimum of 340 seats (54%). The remaining seats are allocated to the other parties in a proportional fashion, and no second round takes place.

If no party has been able to pass the 40% threshold, a second round takes place two weeks after the first one: this time electors receive a ballot where they are allowed to choose between the two parties that received most votes in the first round. The party winning the second round is attributed 340 seats, and the remaining 277 seats are allocated to the other parties in a proportional fashion, according to the results of the first round.

The proportional allocation of seats follows the [[largest remainder method]]. Each party receives a certain number of seats depending on its national result: these seats are then projected onto the 100 constituencies and attributed to the candidates of that constituency, starting from the head of list and then according to the number of preference votes.

An amendment, known as "Erasmus amendment", makes sure Italians studying abroad in the [[Erasmus programme]] can vote.

==Discussion==
Several events have contributed to the development of the electoral law into the current system:
* The collapse of the consociative party system that dominated Italian politics between 1946 and 1993, which was replaced by a new (sometimes harshly) competitive system, making pure party-list proportional representation undesirable and arguably demanding a strong majoritarian correction
* The mediocre performance of electoral coalitions from 1994 to 2013: the two electoral laws of this period (based first on an [[additional member system]], then on a majority bonus for the winning coalition) gave origin to electoral coalitions which were subject to dissolution once in power
* The presence, in the [[Renzi Cabinet]], of small centrist parties, with a uniform distribution on the national territory, which were understandably hostile to solutions based on single-member constituencies, like a [[first-past-the-post]] system
* The good performance of the system used to elect Italian mayors and city councils which, like the Italicum, assures a majority and employs a runoff election (but unlike the Italicum gives the majority bonus to an electoral coalition and not to a single party).

==Reactions==
[[Roberto D'Alimonte]] ([[Libera Università Internazionale degli Studi Sociali Guido Carli|LUISS]]), who was the main scholar proposing the new system, said that "the Italicum is a good instrument that represents a point of satisfactory equilibrium between governability and representativeness. However [...] good government [...] depends mostly on the men and women who use it".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/english-version/2015-05-05/the-long-road-to-majority-system-092344.shtml The Long Road to a Majority System]&lt;/ref&gt; He also made a comparison with the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 United Kingdom general election]], stating that "the Italicum's advantage is indeed that the winner will be assigned 340 seats and the losers will have to divide the remaining 278 seats.... The point is that the Italicum is a majority-assuring system, such that it ensures that there will be an undisputed winner, but unlike the British system, it is not a winner-takes-all system. In fact, the winner does not take the entire pot, but only 54 percent".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/english-version/2015-05-09/the-english-lesson-082913.shtml The English Lesson]&lt;/ref&gt;

Former president of Italy [[Giorgio Napolitano]], who was a key player in pushing Italian parties into reforming the electoral system, remarked that "this law certainly hasn't been written in a month, it took more than one year, there have been many discussions, there has been a committee of scholars who opened the way, therefore I believe this has been an important accomplishment".&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} https://stefanoceccanti.wordpress.com/2015/05/07/napolitano-connette-la-riforma-elettorale-alla-commissione-dei-saggi/&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the politicians critical of the reform, former prime minister [[Enrico Letta]] judged the Italicum "a close relative to the Porcellum" and voted against its adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2015-05-03/letta-italicum-parente-porcellum-domani-voto-no-cuperlo-noi-contrari-ma-no-agguati-152529.shtml Letta: Italicum parente del Porcellum, domani voto no. Cuperlo: noi contrari, ma no agguati]&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, scholars have been divided on the electoral reform. [[Augusto Barbera]] (emeritus professor at the [[University of Bologna]] and one of the most prominent experts of Italian constitutional law) was unhappy with the possibility for a candidate to run in more than one constituency and with the low 3% election threshold but otherwise praised the law. He said that the system does not introduce presidentialism but strengthens the powers of the prime minister, which is "the characteristic of all functioning parliamentary systems (United Kingdom, German chancellorship, Spanish premiership)".&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} https://stefanoceccanti.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/augusto-barbera-oggi-alla-camera-su-riforma-elettorale-e-costituzionale/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Stefano Ceccanti]] ([[Sapienza University of Rome]]), the law is "definitely a good one, it would have been difficult for this fragmented, troublesome Parliament... to do any better".&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} https://stefanoceccanti.wordpress.com/2015/05/03/perche-si-allitalicum-sullhuffington-post-le-mie-16-risposte-alle-domande-del-sole-24-ore/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tommaso Frosini]] ([[Suor Orsola Benincasa University of Naples]]) stated that "it is to the lawmaker's credit to have been able to make a synthesis of the two principles" of governability and proportionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} https://stefanoceccanti.wordpress.com/2015/05/09/tommaso-frosini-sullitalicum/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pasquale Pasquino]] ([[New York University]]), the Italicum "should be preferred over pure majoritarian systems" in which "the electoral law decimates not only small parties, but even parties going close to a 20% of the people's votes".&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} https://stefanoceccanti.wordpress.com/2015/05/09/pasquale-pasquino-su-elezioni-inglesi-ed-italicum-per-il-mulino/&lt;/ref&gt;

Among critics, [[Gianfranco Pasquino]] ([[University of Bologna]]) wrote that "the Italicum is a bad reform with a single merit: the runoff giving real power to electors. As for the rest, the party bonus is wrong, as well as multiple candidatures and the low threshold for the access to the Parliament".&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/commenti-e-idee/2015-05-05/quel-premier-debordante-075254.shtml Quel premier debordante]&lt;/ref&gt;

Constitutional law expert [[Michele Ainis]] ([[Roma Tre University]]) was also critical of the reform. According to him, "the Italicum determines a direct election of the prime minister, giving him a turnkey majority", introducing a constitutional reform by means of an ordinary law.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://www.corriere.it/editoriali/15_aprile_30/regole-come-atto-fede-a3ce5854-eef7-11e4-a9d3-3d4587947417.shtml Le regole come atto di fede]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the foreign press, the Spanish newspaper [[El País]] commented that "the important thing is that the law approved by the Chamber of Deputies obtains stability and governablity, nevertheless respecting the decision coming from the polls as much as possible"&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/05/05/opinion/1430848505_853864.html Renzi arriesga y gana]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moshe Arens]], writing for [[Haaretz]] (the main left-wing journal in Israel), has suggested to use the ''Italicum'' to regulate the election of the [[Knesset]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.656831 Israel's formula for a stable government lies in Italy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional review==

On February 24, 2016 a court in Messina sent the election law for review to the [[Constitutional Court]]: declaring admissible the application&lt;ref&gt;To save the Italicum from the application that hangs over its head, it would have been enough to pass an amendment to Article 66 of the Constitution, thereby eliminating the electoral esclusive cognisaince of the elected House, which is unknown in other countries : {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Legge elettorale: l’Italicum e la Corte|journal= Mondoperaio edizione online|date=2015| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89427357}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; by petitioners,&lt;ref&gt;They objected to the law mainly on the grounds that it awards an unfairly large bonus to the winner and does not sufficiently enable voters to pick their MPs: http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2016/02/24/court-sends-election-law-to-constitutional-court-2_650916ba-6698-4589-8f83-68469f3234bb.html&lt;/ref&gt; the judges called for the Constitutional Court to decide whether eight out of the petitioners' 13 claims that the Italicum breached the Italian Constitution. The Constitutional Court might still decide that the unconstitutionality hypothesis is not founded, and even refuse to examine it. The court's decision is not expecting until after 2017 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.italy24.ilsole24ore.com/art/politics/2016-09-20/italicum-130742.php?uuid=ADuoy2NB|title=Constitutional Court postpones judgment on new electoral law after referendum a done deal|website=Constitutional Court postpones judgment on new electoral law after referendum a done deal|access-date=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A constitutional reform bill passed by the Italian Parliament in April 2016, which is still awaiting popular confirmation by referendum, will require the Constitutional Court to decide on the consititutional legitimacy of the electoral law even if the aforementioned application is rejected. This extraordinary procedure will only take place if the referendum confirms the bill.

'''In Italian trust law''', a [[Trust law|trust]] is a particular juridical instrument by which a settler (''disponente'') can transfer a [[property]] ([[personal property|movable]] or immovable property) to a [[trustee]], who has to exercise and manage this right for a [[beneficiary]] (to whom the full property will be transferred with the termination of the trust) who has the "[[equitable right]]". In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, the beneficiary’s right is not a "diritto reale" but a "personal right" towards the "trustee". If it is not foreseen by the constitutive [[contract]], the property assets cannot be alienated by either the trustee or the beneficiary. Trust property cannot be foreclosed by the personal [[creditor]]s of the trustee, the beneficiary, or their [[heir]]s.

==Current situation==
In [[Italy]], trusts can be used thanks to the adoption of [[Hague Trust Convention|the Hague Convention]] (1 July 1985),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hcch.e-vision.nl/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&amp;cid=59 |title=Convention of 1 July 1985 on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition}}&lt;/ref&gt; effective from 1 January 1992. The "trust interno" is a domestic trust, but refers to a foreign regulation because as of August 2010 Italy does not have a complete and [[organic law|organic]] internal regulation on trust. Trusts can be used for various aims:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_DF4t5jZA1AC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=italian+trust+law#v=onepage&amp;q=italian%20trust%20law&amp;f=false |title=E. ANDREOLI (2003) Trust and Company Law - The Italian Experience (pp. 7-23) in "Estates, taxes, and professional ethics: papers of the International Academy" by Rosalind Atherton, Kluwer Law International, 2003 - Business &amp; Economics|isbn=9789041122230|author1=Conference|first1=International Academy of Estate Trust Law|last2=Atherton|first2=Rosalind F|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; administration, transfer of family [[business asset]]s, transfer of goods for [[charitable trust|charity purposes]], protection of [[Property|patrimony]], etc. The main advantages are the flexibility of its use and its economic convenience compared to Italian traditional juridical instruments. Nevertheless, they have not enjoyed widespread usage in Italy, mainly because of the scarce knowledge of their functioning.

==Proposed legislation==
Italy has proposed its own regulation on trust (''fiducia''). The [[Government of Italy|Italian government]] has been tasked by the Community Law 2010 (bill/ legge comunitaria)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politichecomunitarie.it/normativa/17102/legge-comunitaria-2010 |title=Dipartimento Politiche Comunitarie - Legge Comunitaria 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with adopting a specific regulation on trusts within the Italian juridical system (title II art. 11). The "disegno di legge n. 2284/2010" (bill n. 2284/2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senato.it/leg/16/BGT/Schede/Ddliter/35671.htm |title=Italian Senate - Act n. 2284}}&lt;/ref&gt; an unexamined bill presented by the [[Ministry of Justice (Italy)|Ministry of Justice]] in July 2010, charges the Government with modifying the [[Civil Code of Italy|civil code]] as concerns trusts and that particular form of security contract.

The proposed Italian regulation on trusts is inspired by the French ''fiducie'', which encompassed (by [[Act of Parliament|ordinance]] nº 2009-112 2009) individuals and [[corporation]]s excluded from the payment of [[corporate taxation|corporate taxes]]; the capacity to constitute a trust; and permission for [[Lawyer|attorney]]s to become trustees.&lt;ref&gt;Emanuele Calò - Antonio Cappiello (2010), "La legge francese sulla fiducie (trust): prospettive e possibilita` per una legge italiana", Famiglia, Persone e Successioni FPS 2010 n. 6, UTET Giuridica&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kyklos''' ({{lang-grc |κύκλος}}, {{IPA-el|kýklos|IPA}}, "cycle")  is a term used by some classical [[Ancient Greece| Greek]] authors to describe what they saw as the political cycle of [[government]]s in a society. It was roughly based on the history of Greek [[city-states]] in the same period. The concept of "The Kyklos" is first elaborated in [[Republic (dialogue)|Plato's ''Republic'']], chapters VIII and IX. [[Polybius]] calls it the ''anakyklosis'' or "[[anacyclosis]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.votefamily.us/understanding-the-cycles-of-governments/|title=Understanding the cycles of governments - Let's Defend Our Families!|work=Let's Defend Our Families!|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Polybius, who has the most fully developed version of the cycle, it rotates through the three basic forms of government, [[democracy]], [[aristocracy]], and [[monarchy]] and the three degenerate forms of each of these governments [[ochlocracy]], [[oligarchy]], and [[tyranny]].  Originally society is in ochlocracy but the strongest figure emerges and sets up a monarchy.  The monarch's descendants, who because of their family's power lack virtue, become [[Despotism| despots]] and the monarchy degenerates into a tyranny.  Because of the excesses of the ruler the tyranny is overthrown by the leading citizens of the state who set up an aristocracy. They too quickly forget about virtue and the state becomes an oligarchy. These oligarchs are overthrown by the people who set up a democracy.  Democracy soon becomes corrupt and degenerates into ochlocracy, beginning the cycle anew.

[[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] have somewhat different beliefs.  Plato only sees five forms of government.  Aristotle believes the cycle begins with monarchy and ends in anarchy, but that it does not start anew.  He also refers to democracy as the degenerate form of rule by the many and calls the virtuous form ''[[politeia]]'', which is often translated as constitutional democracy. Cicero describes anacyclosis in his philosophical work ''[[De re publica]]''.

[[Machiavelli]], writing during the [[Renaissance]], appears to have adopted Polybius' version of the cycle.  Machiavelli's adoption of [[anacyclosis]] can be seen in Book I, Chapter II of his ''[[Discourses on Livy]]''.

All the philosophers believed that this cycling was harmful.  The transitions would often be accompanied by violence and turmoil, and a good part of the cycle would be spent with the degenerate forms of government.  Aristotle gave a number of options as to how the cycle could be halted or slowed:
*Even the most minor changes to basic laws and constitutions must be opposed because over time the small changes will add up to a complete transformation.  
*In aristocracies and democracies the tenure of rulers must be kept very short to prevent them from becoming despots
*External threats, real or imagined, preserve internal peace
*The three government basic systems can be blended into one, taking the best elements of each
*If any one individual gains too much power, be it political, monetary, or military he should be [[banishment|banished]] from the polis
*[[Judge]]s and [[magistrate]]s must never accept money to make decisions
*The [[middle class]] must be large
*Most important to Aristotle in preserving a constitution is [[education]]: if all the citizens are aware of law, history, and the constitution they will endeavour to maintain a good government.

Polybius, by contrast, focuses on the idea of [[mixed government]].  The idea that the ideal government is one that blends elements of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy.  Aristotle mentions this notion but pays little attention to it.  To Polybius it is the most important and he saw the [[Roman Republic]] as the embodiment of this mixed constitution and that this explained its stability.

'''Legal mobilisation''' is a tool available to paralegal and [[advocacy]] groups, to achieve [[Empowerment#Legal empowerment|legal empowerment]] by supporting a marginalized issues of a stakeholder, in negotiating with the other concerned agencies and other stakeholders, by strategic combined use of [[Legal proceeding|legal processes]] along with [[advocacy]], media engagement and social mobilisation.&lt;ref name=Cotula&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotula|first1=Lorenzo|title=Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control: Securing Local Resource Rights Within Foreign Investment Projects in Africa|date= 1 Jan 2007|publisher=IIED, 2007|isbn=9781843696674|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-72KOAj92UgC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=legal%20awareness&amp;pg=PR2#v=onepage&amp;q=legal%20awareness&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per Frances Kahen Zemans (1983) '' the Legal mobilisation is "a desire or want, which is translated into a demand as an assertion of one's rights".'' &lt;ref name=Zemans&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zemans|first1=Frances|title=Legal Mobilization: The Neglected Role of the Law in the Political System|journal=The American Political Science Review|date=Sep 1983|publisher=American Political Science Association|location=USA|volume= 77|issue=3|jstor=1957268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lisa Vanhala (November 2011) Legal mobilisation in its  narrowest sense, may refer to high-profile litigation efforts for (or, arguably, against) [[social change]] or more '''broadly, term legal mobilisation has been used to describe any type of process by which an individual or collective actors invoke legal norms, discourse, or symbols to influence policy or behavior.'''&lt;ref name=Vanhala&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vanhala|first1=Lisa|title=Legal Mobilization|journal=Political Science|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/obo/9780199756223-0031|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=24 November 2014|ISBN= 9780199756223|doi=10.1093/obo/9780199756223-0031|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This typically means that there are policies or regulations to mobilize around and a mechanism by which to do so.&lt;ref name=Pettinicchio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pettinicchio|first1=David|title=The When, Why, and How of Legal Mobilization|website=Mobilizing Ideas|url=http://mobilizingideas.wordpress.com/2013/02/04/the-when-why-and-how-of-legal-mobilization/|accessdate=24 November 2014|date=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislative activity does create an opportunity for legal mobilization.

&lt;/ref&gt; 
Because the regulation was issued by NAIC, which is not a federal agency with direct regulatory power, its adoption is on a state-by-state basis.&lt;ref name = "NAIC FAQ"&gt;{{cite web

== Purpose ==

The ''Model Audit Rule'' was issued to:
* Govern the submission of audited statutory financial statements by insurance companies &lt;ref name = "Sutherland" /&gt;
* Drive Consistency Across Insurance Regulators &lt;ref name = "Sunera" /&gt;
* Improve the ability of state insurance departments to oversee the financial condition of insurers &lt;ref name = "Sutherland" /&gt;

The ''Model Audit Rule'' requires the following to be submitted by insurance companies operating in states which have adopted the regulation:
*	An Annual Financial Statement Audit by an Independent [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] &lt;ref name = "MAR 205"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
*	Communication of Internal Control Related Matters Noted in the Audit &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;
*	Managements Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;

== Key Sections ==

=== Section 4 – Financial Report Filing Requirements ===

All insurers must have an annual audit by an independent CPA. This audit must be filed by June 1 following the preceding December 31 year end.&lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt; An insurer may receive an extension for both the Audit report (performed by an independent CPA) and Managements report on internal controls. Here, the term Management refers to the management of the insurer.

For example, filing for the year ending December 31, 2012 must be done by June 1, 2013.

=== Section 5 – Financial Report Contents ===

The annual audited financial report should show the financial position, results of its operations, cash flows and changes in capital and surplus. The insurers report must be in conformity with statutory accounting practices of the Department of Insurance of the insurers’ state.&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;

'''§5(G)''' The financial reports must be comparative, that is, to show the most recent year end against the preceding year end. For example, in a financial report for the year ending December 31, 2013, for each line item, the report must show the result for December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012.&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;

'''§5(A – F)''' The financial report must include:
* Report by an Independent CPA (i.e. Independent Auditors Report) &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;
* Balance Sheet &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;
* Statement of Operations (i.e. Income Statement in a for-profit operation) &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;
* Statement of Cash Flow &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;
* Statement of Changes in Capital and Surplus &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;
* Notes to the Financial Statements &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;

=== Section 7 – Qualifications of Independent External Auditor ===

Many items in this section are based on the underlying requirement that the audit of the insurer must be performed by an independent CPA / CPA firm.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

This section of the ''Model Audit Rule'' describes the qualifications of an Independent external auditor for an insurer through the following major themes:
* '''Liability''' – External Auditor Liability and 
* '''Disassociation''' – Mandatory Audit Partner Rotation, and Audit Leadership being apart from insurers leadership through a minimum time frame 
* '''Non Audit Services''' – Description of Services that the External Auditor cannot perform while engaged in the audit of the insurers financial statement

;Liability
'''§7(A)(2)''' The external auditor is liable for representations made in the audit of the insurer.&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt; This promotes auditors independence because the external auditor has “skin in the game” and can be held liable for misrepresentations made on its audit report, and other responsibilities.

;Disassociation
'''§7(D)(1)''' is similar to SOX 203 in requiring the rotation of the lead audit partner, with a five year “cool off” period, after a five year consecutive period with the audit of the insurer. In addition to this, Section 7(L)(1) addresses that a CPA firms senior manager or partner cannot be a part of the insurers leadership for one year prior to the audit.&lt;ref name="Sutherland" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|9}}

;Non-Audit Services
'''§7(G)(1)''' is similar to SOX 201 in the restriction of non-audit services being performed by the CPA firm conducting the audit of the insurers financials.&lt;ref name="Sutherland" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;

The principles governing non-audit services are that the CPA / CPA firm cannot:
* Function in the role of management (§7(G)(2))&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;
* Audit their own work (§7(G)(2)),&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt; and
* Serve in an advocacy role for the insurer (§7(G)(2))&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;

Particular non-audit services mentioned include (Section 7(G)(1)) 
* Bookkeeping or other services related to accounting records of the Insurer &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|7}}
* Financial Information System Design &amp; Implementation &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|7}}
* Appraisal or Valuation Services &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|7}}
* Actuarial advisory services involving determination of financial statement amounts &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|7}}
* Internal Audit Outsourcing &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|7}} &lt;!-- rp|7 means the page number of the source --&gt;
* Management or Human Resources functions &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|7}}
* Broker / Dealer functions &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|7}}
* Legal services or expert services unrelated to the audit &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|7}}
* Any other services that the commissioner determines, by regulation, to be impermissible.&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

'''§7(F)''' provides that state insurance commissioner the authority to, following a hearing on the matter, force an insurer to change the auditor of its financial statements.&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt; In addition, according to drafting notes contained within this section, the state insurance commissioner shall consider using guidance provided in the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) final rule No.33-8183 &lt;ref name = "SEC 33-8183"&gt;{{cite web 
|url = https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-8183.htm
|title = Securities and Exchange Commission, Release No. 33-8183
|date = March 27, 2003 
|accessdate= July 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
, strengthening the commissions requirements regarding auditor independence.&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;

'''§7(J)''' provides that all audit and non-audit services to the insurer must be approved first by the insurers audit committee.&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|8}}

=== Section 9 – Scope of Audit and Independent External Audit Report ===

This section of the ''Model Audit Rule'' describes the resources that the external auditor must consult in planning and performing the audit of an insurers financial statements. 
The following are the requirements noted and standards borrowed to complete the requirement. The Auditor must:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! '''Component of Audit Scope, per MAR §9''' !! '''External Rule / Standard / Reference'''
|-
| Conduct the audit in accordance with [[Generally Accepted Auditing Standards]] (GAAS) || Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS) &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|10}}
|-
| Obtain Understanding of [[Internal Control]] || AU319 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|10}}
|-
| Scoping for audits of insurers that file a report on internal controls (MAR §16) to accompany the financial statements || Statement of Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 102 or its replacement, and Financial Condition Examiners Handbook (by NAIC)&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|10}}
|}

=== Section 11 – Communication of Internal Control Matters ===

The insurer must provide to the state insurance commissioner a report on internal control weaknesses that are still outstanding as of the close of the audit. The terminology used here is unremediated material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|10}}

To successfully provide the unremediated internal control weaknesses report, the concept of materiality must be explained. Here, the insurer and external auditor are directed to the [[Statements on Auditing Standards]] No. 60 (SAS 60), Internal Control Related Matters Noted in the Audit &lt;ref name="Sutherland" /&gt;{{rp|10}} regarding the term material weakness.&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|11}}

The Internal Controls Report must, for each material weakness:
* Describe the unremediated material weakness &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|11}}
* Describe Actions taken or planned on to remediate the weakness going forward (if not already communicated by the auditor)&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|11}}
* (If none exist), then the report must state that fact &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|11}} 
* The report must also coincide with the most recent insurers annual financial statements &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|11}}

An example of this communication, as would be sent to the state insurance commissioner, is the following:

Honorable Commissioner
State of Domicile Insurance Department 
State of Domicile

Dear Honorable Commissioner:

During the audit completed for the year ended December 31, 20XX, for XYZ Holding Company Inc (“XYZ”), a material weakness was noted in XYZ’s internal control over financial reporting related to the calculation of insurance reserves. Due to the manner in which the data for homeowners policies are captured by the systems used in its Southeastern US regional office, changes in XYZ’s estimate of insurance reserves for certain policies are not reviewed by XYZ’s Actuarial Department prior to being recorded in the company’s accounting records.

A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. In connection with the weakness noted above, XYZ’s management has taken remedial actions to change its procedures for coding policies issued in the states affected so that all homeowners’ policy data are included in the Actuarial Department review of estimate of insurance reserves. This change was effective on July 1, 20XX.

Should you have any questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me at the number noted above. &lt;br /&gt;
Regards,

XYZ Holding Company, Inc.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Section 15 – Conduct of Insurer for Documentation ===
The insurers’ leadership (officers, directors) cannot improperly influence an external auditor of the insurers’ financial statements. “When the officer, director, or person acting under his or her direction knew or should have known that the action, if successful (but regardless of whether the action is in fact successful) could result in rendering the issuers financial statements materially misleading” &lt;ref name = "Sutherland" /&gt;{{rp|7}}&lt;br /&gt;

==== Fraud and Gross Negligence ====

'''§15''' is closely related to Rule '''13b2-2(b)''' under the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]].&lt;ref name = "Sutherland" /&gt;{{rp|7}} The standard for violation used here includes [[fraud]] (acting with intent to deceive) as well as [[gross negligence]] (reckless disregard for the truth). Gross negligence is invoked under the phrase “known or should have known” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial Mistakes to Avoid|url=http://holbornassets.com/top-7-financial-mistakes-to-avoid-in-2016/|accessdate=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Sutherland" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

=== Section 16 – Management Report on Internal Control ===
This section of the ''Model Audit Rule'' is most closely related to and departs from Sarbanes Oxley Section 404 (SOX 404) on Internal Control.&lt;ref name = "Sutherland" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

* Similar to SOX 404, Management (the insurer) is required to issue an internal controls assessment report.&lt;ref name = "Sutherland" /&gt;{{rp|7}}
* Departing from SOX 404, the external auditor does not attest to Managements assessment of internal controls.&lt;ref name = "Sutherland" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

'''§16(A - D)''' Which Insurers must file – generally, this report is required for large insurers, those with:
* Premiums of $500,000,000 or more (with exceptions),&lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|15}} or
* That are subject to Sarbanes Oxley section 404 (with exceptions) &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|15}}

'''No need for Duplicate Internal Control Reports'''

If an insurer is a publicly traded and subject to SOX 404, then they are already preparing an internal controls report. Therefore, the ''Model Audit Rule'' specifically states that this type of insurer “may file its or its parent’s section 404 report and an addendum in satisfaction of this §16 requirement”.&lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|15}}

The addendum is a statement by the insurer that “there are no material processes with respect to the preparation of the insurer’s or group of insurers’ audited statutory financial statements...[]... excluded from the section 404 report.” &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|15}}

'''§16(D)''' Internal Control Report Contents – Managements Report on Internal Control for statutory financial statements must include: 
* Statement that Management is Responsible for establishing and maintaining Internal Controls &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}}
* Statement that Management has in-fact established internal controls over financial reporting &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}}
* Statement on the effectiveness of Internal Controls (providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial statements according to statutory accounting principles) &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}}
* Approach or processes regarding Managements internal control evaluation &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}}
* Scope of Work regarding Management internal control evaluation &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}}
* Disclosure of unremediated material weaknesses of internal control (If there is at least one, management cannot conclude that internal controls are effective) &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}}
* Statement on inherent limitations of internal control &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}}
* Signatures of CEO and CFO &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}}

'''§16(E)''' Management (Insurer) Supporting Activities – During an Audit or financial condition examination, the insurer must make available the basis for assertions used in evaluation of internal control.&lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}}

The insurer is given the freedom (discretion) regarding: &lt;br /&gt;
* Internal control framework used,&lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}} and
* Nature and extent of documentation&lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}}

The insurer has aforementioned discretion under the ''Model Audit Rule'' to achieve internal control objectives in a cost-effective manner.&lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}}

'''Report and Addendum Example:''' The following is of an SEC registrant who had all Internal Controls covered in the 404 Report.

XYZ Holding Company Inc (“XYZ”) is required to file annual reports on Form 10-K/20-F with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Each of the insurance companies listed on Attachment B is a wholly owned subsidiary of XYZ. For the purpose of XYZ’s Management’s Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has identified its “Group of insurers,” as that term is defined in [relevant state statute or Section 3H of the Model], as the insurance companies listed on Attachment B.

Management of XYZ is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over statutory financial reporting. XYZ’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of statutory financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting principles. Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness, as of December 31, 201X, of the Group of insurers’ internal control over statutory financial reporting, based on the framework established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework Issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment under that framework, management concluded that the Group of insurers’ internal control over statutory financial reporting is effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of statutory financial statements as of December 31, 201X.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are also subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In satisfaction of the Group of insurers’ obligation to deliver Management’s Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 201X, as permitted by [relevant state statute or Section 16C of the Model], XYZ is hereby providing the Insurance Commissioner of [domiciliary state] copies of Management’s Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting and the report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting for XYZ included in XYZ’s Form 10-K/20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 201X (or alternatively the Annual Report to Stockholders). In addition, an Addendum (Attachment A) is included to this report which identifies the material processes that were not included in the Section 404 Report (as defined in Attachment A).

Based on management review of internal controls, there were no unremediated material weaknesses as of December 31, 201X identified as part of the Group of insurers’ internal control structure over the statutory financial statements for the year ended December 31, 201X.

Addendum to Management’s Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

For the Year Ended December 31, 201X

For purposes of this addendum, the “Section 404 Report” means Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and the report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting contained in or incorporated by reference in the Form 10-K/20-F.

In [[common-law]] [[jurisprudence]], '''''procedendo''''' is one of the [[prerogative writ]]s. It is a [[writ]] that sends a case from an appellate court to a lower court with an order to proceed to judgment. 

{{quote|The writ of procedendo is merely an order from a court of superior jurisdiction to one of inferior jurisdiction to proceed to judgment. It does not in any case attempt to control the inferior court as to what that judgment should be.&lt;ref&gt;''State ex rel. Davey v. Owen'', 133 Ohio St. 96, 106 (Ohio 1937).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The writ of ''procedendo ad judicium'' was the earliest remedy for the refusal or neglect of justice on the part of the courts. It was an original writ, issuing out of chancery to the judges of any subordinate court, commanding them in the king's name to proceed to judgment, but without specifying any particular judgment. In case of disobedience or of neglect on the part of the judges to whom it was addressed, or refusal by them to act, they were liable to punishment for contempt.

Inherently, the most important limitation on this jurisdiction is that the [[writ of mandamus]] is not a proper remedy to control or direct the decisions of inferior courts in matters wherein they have judicial cognizance and discretion. In other words, so far as the writ affects the action of inferior courts, its use is not to be extended to compel the rendition of a particular judgment, in accordance with the views of a higher court.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Press Printers &amp; Publishers, Inc.'', 12 F.2d 660, 664 (3d Cir. 1926)&lt;/ref&gt;

It corresponds to ''[[certiorari]]'', except that ''certiorari'' is a higher court's order to a lower court to send the record of a case to it for appellate review.

In the Federal Court System in the United States, this process is now known as [[Remand_(court_procedure)|remand]].

The '''prostitution age of consent''' is the minimum age at which a person may legally engage in prostitution. Where this is not specified in the individual county's prostitution laws, then the general [[age of consent]] laws for that country apply.

Works are in the [[public domain]] if they are not covered by [[intellectual property]] rights, such as [[copyright]], at all, or if the intellectual property rights to the works has expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Boyle| first = James| title = The Public Domain: Enclosing the Commons of the Mind| publisher = CSPD| year = 2008| pages = 38| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=Fn1Pl9Gv_EMC&amp;dq=public+domain&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =9780300137408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every work first published before 1923 has been in the American public domain since 1998. The public domain will reopen on January 1, 2019, when works from 1923 lose their copyright protection.

== History ==

In the [[United States]], copyright began with the introduction of the Constitution in 1787; creators of works created after the ratification of the Constitution could receive copyright, while works created before the Constitution went into effect remain in the public domain.  

Works additionally fall to the public domain automatically when copyright has expired, though additional alterations to copyright laws since the original Constitution have extended the length of time for which a given copyright may be valid or can be renewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/49571314/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/edison-voice-recording-old-not-oldest/#.Vro6rk9STvg|title=Edison voice recording is old, but not the oldest|date=26 October 2012|work=nbcnews.com|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound recordings under public domain ===
{{AP| Public domain music }}
Sound recordings fixed in a tangible form before February 15, 1972, have been generally covered by common law or in some cases by anti-piracy statutes enacted in certain states, not by federal copyright law, and the anti-piracy statutes typically have no duration limit. As such, virtually all sound recordings, regardless of age, are presumed to still be under copyright protection in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USA Copyright Law for Sound Recordings|url=http://www.pdinfo.com/copyright-law/public-domain-sound-recordings.php|website=PD Info|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1971 Sound Recordings Act, effective 1972,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://jessefeder.com/copyright/docs/pl92-140.pdf Sound Recordings Act of 1971] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713102632/http://jessefeder.com/copyright/docs/pl92-140.pdf |date=2011-07-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1976 Copyright Act, effective 1978, provide federal copyright for unpublished and published sound recordings fixed on or after February 15, 1972. Recordings fixed before February 15, 1972, are still covered, to varying degrees, by common law or state statutes.&lt;ref name="Pub135"&gt;An exception to the 1976 Copyright Act's general abolition of [[common law copyright]]. June M. Besek, "[http://www.clir.org/PUBS/reports/pub135/contents.html Copyright Issues Relevant to Digital Preservation and Dissemination of Pre-1972 Commercial Sound Recordings by Libraries and Archives]", CLIR Reports, December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Non-U.S. sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972, are covered under U.S. copyright (for the normal durations) if the country of origin shares an international copyright agreement with the United States, and the work was not published in the U.S. within 30 days of its first publication. Robert Clarida, "[http://chnm.gmu.edu/digitalhistory/links/pdf/chapter7/7.55b.pdf Who Owns Pre-1972 Sound Recordings?]", ''The Intellectual Property Strategist'', November 13, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Any rights or remedies under state law for sound recordings fixed ''before'' February 15, 1972, are not annulled or limited by the 1976 Copyright Act until February 15, 2067.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{usc|17|301}} ''Preemption with respect to other laws''&lt;/ref&gt; On that date, all sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972, will go into the public domain in the United States.

For sound recordings fixed ''on or after'' February 15, 1972, the earliest year that any will go out of copyright and into the public domain in the U.S. will be 2043,&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Sound recordings fixed between February 15, 1972, and December 31, 1972, but not published or registered before 2003, whose authors, not working for hire, died in 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; and not in any substantial number until 2048.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Sound recordings fixed on or after February 15, 1972, and first published 1978–2002, whose authors, not working for hire, died before 1978.

===Public domain videos===

Since the invention of video capture and animation techniques, thousand of films or videos have entered the public domain. Some examples include:

====TV series====
A number of television series, because they were released before 1964 and did not have their copyright renewed (such as almost all of the [[List of surviving DuMont Television Network broadcasts|extant DuMont Television Network archive]]), were originally recorded before 1989 without a valid copyright notice, or were works of the United States government, have episodes in the public domain.

Public domain status of television episodes is made complicated by [[derivative work]] considerations; for example, 16 episodes of ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' are, due to expired copyright, in the public domain by themselves, but in 2007, [[CBS]] was able to claim an indirect copyright on the episodes in question by claiming they were derivative works of earlier episodes still under copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-txnd-3_06-cv-00588|title=CBS Operations Inc v. Reel Funds International Inc|work=gpo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the 1964 special ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'' was published with an invalid copyright notice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=  Mailbag: 'Rudolph' numerals wrong in opening credits|last=Heldenfels|first=Rich|work=[[Akron Beacon-Journal]]|date=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but uses copious amounts of copyrighted music and is based on an original story that is still under copyright.

====Public domain films====

[[File:TheLittleShopOfHorrors1960.webmhd.webm|thumb|thumbtime=12|upright=1.5|''The Little Shop of Horrors'' (1960)]]
Hundreds of American [[live-action]] films are in the public domain because they were never copyrighted or because their copyrights have since expired. These movies can be viewed online at websites such as [[Internet Archive]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/movies?&amp;sort=-downloads&amp;page=2|title=Download &amp; Streaming : Moving Image Archive : Internet Archive|work=archive.org|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can also be downloaded from websites like [[Public Domain Torrents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicdomaintorrents.info/nshowcat.html?category=ALL|title=Category ALL|work=publicdomaintorrents.info|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Examples of notable such public domain films include:

* [[Charade (1963 film)|''Charade'']] (1963)
* ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968)
* ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]'' (1960)

== Public domain in copyrighted works in the United States ==
Congress has restored expired copyrights several times: "After World War I and after World War II, there were special amendments to the Copyright Act to permit for a limited time and under certain conditions the recapture of works that might have fallen into the public domain, principally by aliens of countries with which we had been at war."&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of Dorothy Schrader, general counsel of the U.S. copyright office, hearing for House Resolution 1623, serial 100/50.&lt;/ref&gt; Works published with notice of copyright or registered in [[unpublished]] form in the years 1964 through 1977 automatically had their copyrights renewed for a second term. Works published with notice of copyright or registered in unpublished form on or after January 1, 1923, and prior to January 1, 1964, had to be renewed during the 28th year of their first term of copyright to maintain copyright for a full 95-year term.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Copyright Office, Circular 15a, [http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ15a.html#special Duration of Copyright: Provisions of the Law Dealing with the Length of Copyright Protection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325132823/http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ15a.html |date=2009-03-25 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of maps, music, and movies, the vast majority of works published in the United States before 1964 were never renewed for a second copyright term.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Fishman, ''The Public Domain'', 4th ed., Nolo, 2008, p. 383–384. {{ISBN|978-1-4133-0858-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Works "[[Copyright status of work by the U.S. government|prepared by an officer or employee of the U.S. government as part of that person's official duties]]" are automatically in the public domain by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|17|ch1}} ''Subject matter and scope of copyright''&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[military]] [[journalism]], [[United States federal court|federal court]] opinions (but not necessarily state court opinions), [[congressional committee]] reports, and [[United States census|census]] data. However, works created by a contractor for the government are still subject to copyright. Even public domain documents may have their availability limited by laws limiting the spread of [[classified information]].

The claim that "pre-1923 works are in the public domain" is correct only for published works; unpublished works are under federal copyright for at least the life of the author plus 70 years. For a [[work for hire]], the copyright in a work created before 1978, but not theretofore in the public domain or registered for copyright, subsists from January 1, 1978, and endures for a term of 95 years from the year of its first publication, or a term of 120 years from the year of its creation, whichever expires first.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|17|ch3}} ''Duration of Copyright''&lt;/ref&gt; If the work was created before 1978 but first published 1978–2002, the federal copyright will not expire before 2047.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|17|303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] Implementation Act of 1988, the lack of a proper copyright notice would place an otherwise copyrightable work into the public domain, although for works published between January 1, 1978, and February 28, 1989, this could be prevented by registering the work with the [[Library of Congress]] within five years of publication. After March 1, 1989, an author's copyright in a work begins when it is fixed in a tangible form; neither publication nor registration is required, and a lack of a copyright notice does not place the work into the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.pdf Copyright Notice]'', U.S. Copyright Office Circular 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2019, older published works will resume entering the Public Domain under the [[Copyright Term Extension Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/ Public Domain Day] Duke University Center for the Study of the Public Domain&lt;/ref&gt; Works from 1923 that have been identified as entering the public domain in this period include ''The Great American Novel,'' (a novel by [[William Carlos Williams]]); the original silent version of the film ''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]],'' by Cecil B. DeMille; and the musical ''[[London Calling!]],'' by Noel Coward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fleishman|first1=Glenn|title=A Landslide of Classic Art Is About to Enter the Public Domain|journal=The Atlantic|date=April 2018|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/04/copywritten-so-dont-copy-me/557420/|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound recordings===

Very few sound recordings are in the public domain in the United States. Sound recordings fixed in a tangible form before February 15, 1972, have been generally covered by common law or in some cases by anti-piracy statutes enacted in certain states, not by federal copyright law, and the anti-piracy statutes typically have no duration limit. The 1971 Sound Recordings Act, effective 1972,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and the 1976 Copyright Act, effective 1978, provide federal copyright for unpublished and published sound recordings fixed on or after February 15, 1972. Recordings fixed before February 15, 1972, are still covered, to varying degrees, by common law or state statutes.&lt;ref name="Pub135"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Any rights or remedies under state law for sound recordings fixed ''before'' February 15, 1972, are not annulled or limited by the 1976 Copyright Act until February 15, 2067.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; On that date, all sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972, will go into the public domain in the United States.

For sound recordings fixed ''on or after'' February 15, 1972, the earliest year that any will go out of copyright and into the public domain in the U.S. will be 2043,&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; and not in any substantial number until 2048.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; Sound recordings fixed and published on or after February 15, 1972, and before 1978, which did not carry a proper copyright notice on the recording or its cover entered the public domain on publication.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; From 1978 to March 1, 1989, the owners of the copyrights had up to five years to remedy this omission without losing the copyright.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; Since March 1, 1989, no copyright notice has been required.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt;

In September 2018, the US Senate passed the Music Modernization Act, where sound recordings released before 1957 will enter the public domain 95 years after their first release.

===Examples===

In the United States, the images of [[Frank Capra]]'s film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946) entered into the public domain in 1974, because the copyright holder failed to file a renewal application with the Copyright Office during the 28th year after the film's release or publication. However, in 1993, Republic Pictures utilized the 1990 [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Stewart v. Abend]]'' to enforce its claim of copyright because the film was a [[derivative work]] of a short story that was under a separate, existing copyright, to which Republic owned the film adaptation rights, effectively regaining control of the work in its complete form.&lt;ref&gt;James Bates, "Company Town Yule With Less 'Wonderful Life'? Tune In", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', November 23, 1993, p. D4.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, [[Paramount Pictures]] owns the copyright to the film.

[[Charles Chaplin]] re-edited and scored his 1925 film ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' for reissue in 1942. Subsequently, the 1925 version fell into the public domain when Chaplin's company failed to renew its copyright in 1953, although the 1942 version is still under US copyright.&lt;ref&gt;''Film Superlist: Motion Pictures in the US Public Domain''. Created by Walter E. Hurst; updated edition by D. Richard Baer. Hollywood Film Archive, 1992–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The distributor of the cult film ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'', after changing the film's title at the last moment before release in 1968, failed to include a proper copyright notice in the new titles, thereby immediately putting the film into the public domain after its release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.about.com/od/landofthedead/a/deadgr062105.htm George Romero talks about ''Land of the Dead''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415152303/http://movies.about.com/od/landofthedead/a/deadgr062105.htm |date=2008-04-15 }}, ''[[About.com]]'', June 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This provision of US copyright law was revised with the [[United States Copyright Act of 1976]], which allowed such negligence to be remedied within five years of publication.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.html#omission Omission of notice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326042005/http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.html |date=2009-03-26 }}", ''Copyright Notice'', US Copyright Office Circular 3, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of TV series in America have lapsed into the public domain, in whole or only in the case of certain episodes, giving rise to wide distribution of some shows on DVD. Series that have only certain episodes in the public domain include ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'', ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[Annie Oakley (TV series)|Annie Oakley]]'', and ''[[Decoy (TV series)|Decoy]]''.

Laws may make some types of works and inventions ineligible for monopoly; such works immediately enter the public domain upon publication. Many kinds of mental creations, such as publicized [[baseball statistics]], are never covered by copyright. However, any special layout of baseball statistics, or the like, would be covered by copyright law. For example, while a [[Telephone directory|phone book]] is not covered by copyright law, any special method of laying out the information would be.

===Copyright notice===

{{main|copyright notice}}
In the past, a work would enter the public domain in the United States if it was released without a copyright notice. This was true prior to March 1, 1989, but is no longer the case. Any work (of certain, enumerated types) now receives copyright as soon as it is fixed in a tangible medium.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer Software Rental Amendments Act===

There are several references to putting copyrighted work into the public domain. The first reference is actually in a statute passed by Congress, in the Computer Software Rental Amendments Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–650, 104 Stat. 5089 (1990)). Although most of the Act was codified into [[Title 17 of the United States Code]], there is a very interesting provision relating to "public domain shareware" which was not, and is therefore often overlooked.

: '''Sec. 805. Recordation of Shareware'''
: (a) IN GENERAL— The [[Register of Copyrights]] is authorized, upon receipt of any document designated as pertaining to computer [[shareware]] and the fee prescribed by section 708 of title 17, United States Code, to record the document and return it with a certificate of recordation.
: (b) MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS; PUBLICATION OF INFORMATION— The Register of Copyrights is authorized to maintain current, separate records relating to the recordation of documents under subsection (a), and to compile and publish at periodic intervals information relating to such recordations. Such publications shall be offered for sale to the public at prices based on the cost of reproduction and distribution.
: (c) DEPOSIT OF COPIES IN LIBRARY OF CONGRESS— In the case of public domain computer shareware, at the election of the person recording a document under subsection (a), 2 complete copies of the best edition (as defined in section 101 of title 17, United States Code) of the computer shareware as embodied in machine-readable form may be deposited for the benefit of the Machine-Readable Collections Reading Room of the [[Library of Congress]].
: (d) REGULATIONS— The Register of Copyrights is authorized to establish regulations not inconsistent with law for the administration of the functions of the Register under this section. All regulations established by the Register are subject to the approval of the Librarian of Congress.

One purpose of this legislation appears to be to allow "public domain shareware" to be filed at the [[Library of Congress]], presumably so that the shareware would be more widely disseminated. Therefore, one way to release computer software into the public domain might be to make the filing and pay the [http://www.bitlaw.com/source/17usc/708.html $20] fee. This could have the effect of "certifying" that the author intended to release the software into the public domain. It does not seem that registration is necessary to release the software into the public domain, because the law does not state that public domain status is conferred by registration. [[Judicial]] rulings supports this conclusion, see below.

By comparing paragraph (a) and (c), one can see that Congress distinguishes "public domain" shareware as a special kind of shareware. Because this law was passed after the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988, Congress was well aware that newly created computer programs (two years worth, since the Berne Act was passed) would automatically have copyright attached. Therefore, one reasonable inference is that Congress intended that authors of shareware would have the power to release their programs into the public domain. This interpretation is followed by the Copyright Office in [http://www.bitlaw.com/source/37cfr/201_26.html 37 C.F.R. § 201.26].

===Berne Convention Implementation Act===

The Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 states in section twelve that the Act "does not provide copyright protection for any work that is in the public domain." The congressional committee report explains that this means simply that the Act does not apply retroactively.

Although the only part of the act that does mention "public domain" does not speak to whether authors have the right to dedicate their work to the public domain, the remainder of the committee report does not say that they intended copyright to be an indestructible form of property. Rather the language speaks about getting rid of [[copyright formalities]] in order to comply with Berne (non-compliance had become a severe impediment in trade negotiations) and making registration and marking optional, but encouraged. A fair reading is that the Berne Act did not intend to take away author's right to dedicate works to the public domain, which they had (by default) under the 1976 Act.

===Section 203 of the Copyright Act===

Although there is support in the statutes for allowing work to be dedicated to the public domain, there cannot be an unlimited right to dedicate work to the public domain because of a quirk of U.S. copyright law which grants the author of a work the right to cancel "the exclusive or nonexclusive grant of a transfer or license of copyright or of any right under a copyright" thirty-five years later, unless the work was originally a [[work for hire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html#203 |title=§ 203. Termination of transfers and licenses granted by the author |work= U.S. Copyright Office&amp;nbsp;— Copyright Law: Chapter 2 |accessdate=September 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case law===
Another form of support comes from the case ''[[Computer Associates Int. Inc. v. Altai Inc.|Computer Associates Int'l v. Altai]]'', 982 F.2d 693, which set the standard for determining copyright infringement of computer software. This case discusses the public domain.

: '''(c) Elements Taken from the Public Domain'''
: Closely related to the non-protectability of scenes a faire, is material found in the public domain. Such material is free for the taking and cannot be appropriated by a single author even though it is included in a copyrighted work. ... We see no reason to make an exception to this rule for elements of a computer program that have entered the public domain by virtue of freely accessible program exchanges and the like. See 3 Nimmer Section 13.03 [F] ; see also Brown Bag Software, slip op. at 3732 (affirming the district court’s finding that "[p]laintiffs may not claim copyright protection of an ... expression that is, if not standard, then commonplace in the computer software industry."). Thus, a court must also filter out this material from the allegedly infringed program before it makes the final inquiry in its [[substantial similarity]] analysis.

This decision holds that computer software may enter the public domain through "freely accessible program exchanges and the like," or by becoming "commonplace in the computer industry." Relying only on this decision, it is unclear whether an author can dedicate his work to the public domain simply by labeling it as such, or whether dedication to the public domain requires widespread dissemination.

This could make a distinction in a [[CyberPatrol]]-like case, where a software program is released, leading to litigation, and as part of a settlement the author assigns his copyright. If the author has the power to release his work into the public domain, there would be no way for the new owner to stop the circulation of the program. A court may look on an attempt to abuse the public domain in this way with disfavor, particularly if the program has not been widely disseminated. Either way, a fair reading is that an author may choose to release a computer program to the public domain if he can arrange for it to become popular and widely disseminated.

Public service is also a course that can be studied at a college or university. Examples of public services are the [[fire brigade]], [[police]], [[air force]], and [[paramedics]].

==Sectors==
Public services may be associated with fundamental [[human rights]] (such as the right to water). The Volunteer Fire Dept. and Ambulance Corps. are institutions with the mission of servicing the community. A service is helping others with a specific need or want. Here, service ranges from a doctor curing an illness, to a repair person, to a food pantry.

In modern [[developed countries]], the term "public services" (or "services of general interest") often includes:{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}
* [[Court|Courts]]
* [[Electricity]]
* [[Education]], [e.g. state (public) schools, public universities, etc...]
* [[Emergency service]]s, (e.g. Fire, EMS, Law Enforcement, Search and Rescue, etc...)

* [[Telecommunications]]
* [[Urban planning]]
* [[Transportation infrastructure]]
* [[Waste management]], (e.g. wastewater, solid waste, recycling, etc...)
* [[Water supply network]]

==Public administration==
{{Main article|Public Administration}}In modern democracies, public service is often performed by [[Employment|employees]] known as [[Civil service|civil servants]] who are hired by elected [[officials]]. Government agencies are not profit-oriented and their employees are motivated very differently.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Studies of their work have found contrasting results including both higher levels of effort&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Government Employees: Working Hard or Hardly Working? |journal=The American Review of Public Administration |first1=Sue A. |last1=Frank |first2=Gregory B. |last2=Lewis |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=36-51 |date=March 2004 |doi=10.1177/0275074003258823}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fewer hours of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.heritage.org/jobs-and-labor/report/government-employees-work-less-private-sector-employees |title=Government Employees Work Less than Private-Sector Employees |journal=Backgrounder |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |first=Jason |last=Richwine |issue=2724 |pages=1-6 |date=11 September 2012 |access-date=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey in the UK found that private sector hiring managers do not credit government experience as much as private sector experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://business.financialpost.com/executive/careers/public-sector-stigma |title=Public sector stigma: The 100,000 workers Tim Hudak removes from the provincial payroll could have a tough transition to the private sector |work=Financial Post |first=Dan |last=Ovsey |date=27 May 2014 |access-date=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public workers tend to make less in wages when adjusting for education, although that difference is reduced when benefits and hours are included.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/02/07/are-public-sector-employees-overpaid/ |title=Are public-sector employees “overpaid”? |work=The Washington Post |first=Sasha |last=Volokh |date=7 February 2014 |accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public workers have other intangible benefits such as increased job security.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Characteristics==
A public service may sometimes have the characteristics of a [[public good]] (being [[non-rivalrous]] and [[non-excludable]]), but most are services which may (according to prevailing [[social norms]]) be under-provided by the [[Market (economics)|market]]. In most cases public services are [[Service (economics)|services]], i.e. they do not involve manufacturing of [[good (accounting)|goods]]. They may be provided by local or national monopolies, especially in sectors which are [[natural monopoly|natural monopolies]].

They may involve outputs that are hard to attribute to specific individual effort or hard to measure in terms of key characteristics such as quality. They often require high levels of training and education. They may attract people with a public service ethos who wish to give something to the wider public or community through their work.

==History==

Governing bodies have long provided core public services. The tradition of keeping citizens secure through organized military defence dates to at least four thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J53rAgAAQBAJ |title=The Power of the Bull |publisher=Routledge |location=London |last1=Rice |first1=Michael |page=13 |date=1998 |isbn=978-1-317-72583-1 |quote=As the more advanced social institutions began to take shape they contributed to some counterbalancing of the essential insecurity of man's condition. It was inevitable that ambitious and assertive men should see an opportunity for establishing for themselves positions of power and influence. No doubt many such occasions had their origins in a genuine concern for the public good [...] The position of [...] the war-band leader as the strong arm of the community's defence would increasingly be confirmed by the subjection of the community to the members of what [...] were becoming, demonstrably, elites, [...] This period, embracing part of the fifth and all of the fourth and third millennia before the present era, is absolutely pivotal to the development of the modern world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintaining order through local delegated authority originated at least as early as the [[Warring States period]] (5th to 3rd centuries BCE) in ancient China with the institution of ''xian'' (prefectures) under the control of a centrally-appointed prefect. Historical evidence of state provision of [[dispute resolution]] through a legal/justice system goes back at least as far as ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j3pmDAAAQBAJ |title=Law's Political Foundations: Rivers, Rifles, Rice, and Religion |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |location=Cheltemham, Gloucestershire |last1=Haley |first1=John O. |pages=43-44 |date=2016 |isbn=978-1-78536-850-9 |quote=Pharaonic Egypt epitomizes a regulatory, public law regime. [...] The principal function of this elaborate apparatus was to maintain order and security, and, above all, to acquire as much of the surplus agricultural wealth and labor as possible.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A primary public service in ancient history involved ensuring the general favor of the [[gods]] through a theologically and ceremonially correct [[state religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JcvZCgAAQBAJ |title=The Cambridge Companion to Political Theology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |last1=Hovey |first1=Craig |last2=Phillips |first2=Elizabeth |page=4-5 |date=2015 |isbn=978-1-107-05274-1 |quote=To ensure the favor of the gods was the preeminent task of ancient rulers worldwide, for they all were priestly kings. The Roman Caesar was the ''pontifex maximus'' of Rome's state god. The Chinese emperor certainly stood over his subjects as 'Son of Heaven,' but if he fell into disfavor with heaven and his country was visited by famine, plague, earthquakes, and floods, he could be overthrown. The Moloch of Carthage demanded children as sacrifices; the Aztecs and Mayas offered their Gods still-quivering hearts. These political religions were ''do ut des'' religions in which the relationship between deity and worshippers was one of contractual exchange.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread provision of [[public utility|public utilities]] as public services in developed countries usually began in the late nineteenth century, often with the [[municipal]] development of [[gas]] and [[water]] services. Later, governments began to provide other services such as [[electricity]] and [[healthcare]]. In most developed countries local or national governments continue to provide such services, the biggest exceptions being the [[United States|U.S.]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]], where private provision is arguably proportionally more significant.{{citation needed|reason=Compare: National Health Service in the UK|date=March 2015}} Nonetheless, such privately provided public services are often strongly regulated, for example (in the US) by [[Public Utility Commission]]s.

In [[developing countries]] public services tend to be much less well developed. For example, water services might only be available to the [[wealthy]] [[middle class]]. For [[political]] reasons the service is often [[subsidized]], which reduces the finance potentially available for expansion to [[Poverty|poorer]] communities.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Nationalization==
{{main|Nationalization}}
Nationalization took off following the [[World War]]s of the first half of the twentieth century. Across [[Europe]], because of the extreme demands on industries and the economy, [[central planning]] was required to make production maximally efficient. Many public services, especially electricity, gas and public transport are products of this era. Following the Second World War, many countries also began to implement [[universal health care]] and expanded [[education]] under the funding and guidance of the state.

==Privatization==
[[File:A group of Damas de Rojo.jpg|thumb|A group of [[Chile]]an 'Damas de Rojo', volunteers on their local hospital.]]
{{main|Privatization}}
There are several ways to privatize public services. A free-market corporation may be established and sold to private investors, relinquishing government control altogether. Thus it becomes a private (not public) service. Another option, used in the [[Nordic countries]], is to establish a corporation, but keep ownership or voting power essentially in the hands of the government. For example, the [[Finland|Finnish state]] owned 49% of [[Kemira]] until 2007, the rest being owned by private investors. A 49% share did not make it a "government enterprise", but it meant that all other investors together would have to oppose the state's opinion in order to overturn the state's decisions in the shareholder's meeting. Regulated corporation can also acquire permits on the agreement that they fulfill certain public service duties. When a private corporation runs a [[natural monopoly]], then the corporation is typically heavily regulated, to prevent abuse of monopoly power. Lastly, the government can buy the service on the free market. In many countries, [[medication]] is provided in this manner: the government reimburses part of the price of the medication. Also, bus traffic, electricity, healthcare and waste management are privatized in this way. One recent innovation, used in the UK increasingly as well as Australia and Canada is [[public-private partnership]]s. This involves giving a long lease to private consortia in return for partly funding infrastructure.

[[File:Cold meat salad.jpg|thumb|Various distinct components can combine to make a salad.]]

The '''salad bowl''' concept suggests that the integration of the many different cultures of [[United States]] residents combine like a [[salad]], as opposed to the more traditional notion of a cultural [[melting pot]]. New York City can be considered as being a "salad bowl". In [[Canada]] this concept is more commonly known as the [[cultural mosaic]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalman, Bobbie (2010). Canada: The Culture. Crabtree Pub. p. 4. {{ISBN|978-0-7787-9284-0}}. Retrieved 2012-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt; In the salad bowl model, different American cultures are brought together &amp;mdash; like salad ingredients &amp;mdash; but do not form together into a single [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]] culture. Each culture keeps its own distinct qualities. This idea proposes a society of many individual, "pure" cultures in addition to the mixed culture that is modern American culture, and the term has become more [[political correctness|politically correct]] than ''melting pot'' {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}, since the latter suggests that ethnic groups may be unable to preserve their cultures due to [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]]...

Some {{Who|date=August 2013}} have compared the European concept of [[multiculturalism]] ([[multikulti]]) to a salad bowl approach, which prevents the full integration of immigrant groups into host societies, whereas the traditional American approach of the [[melting pot]] results in successful integration of successive immigrant waves into the larger American society.

The story of [[Pocahontas]] and [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] or the peaceful co-existence of Native Americans and new immigrants from England has been counted as a prototype of American multiculturalism.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} However, some scholars{{Who|date=August 2013}} blamed it as a [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] concept of [[melting pot]] and suggested a new concept of salad bowl.

An example of the European version of a salad bowl can be seen in its policy regarding the EU programme ‘integration of non-European nationals’ which finances and promotes integration initiatives targeting those who are not members of the EU25. This project aims to encourage dialogue in civil society, develop integration models, and spread and highlight the best initiatives regarding integration.

The salad bowl idea in practice has its supporters and detractors. Supporters argue that being American does not inherently tie a person to a single culture, though rather to citizenship and loyalty to the United States. Thus, one does not need to abandon their cultural heritage in order to be considered "American". Critics tend to oppose the idea in tandem with other critiques on multiculturalism, saying that America needs to have a common culture in order to preserve a common national identity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4074">The '''Semantic Interoperability Centre Europe''' ('''SEMIC.EU''') was an [[eGovernment]] service initiated by the [[European Commission]] and managed by the Interoperable Delivery of European eGovernment Services to public Administrations, Businesses and Citizens ([[IDABC]]) Unit. As one of the 'horizontal measures' of the IDABC, it was established as a permanent implementation of the principles stipulated in the 'European Interoperability Framework' (EIF).
It offered a service for the exchange of [[semantic interoperability]] solutions, with a focus on demands of eGovernment in Europe. Through the establishment of a single sharing and collaboration point, the European Union wanted to resolve the problems of semantic interoperability amongst the EU member states. The main idea behind the service was to make visible specifications that already exist, so as to increase their reuse. In this way, governmental agencies and developers benefit as they do not reinvent the wheel, they reduce development costs, and increase the interoperability of their systems. 

In December 2011, the content and the activities of SEMIC.eu were migrated to a new collaborative platform: [[Joinup collaboration platform|Joinup]]. The reason for the migration to Joinup was to provide public administrations in Europe with better communication and collaboration tools to share experience with interoperability solutions for public administrations, to increase the number of users and to leverage synergies between the OSOR.eu and SEMIC.eu user communities, while optimising the use of public funding. 

== Objectives ==
The IDABC programme listed the efficient implementation of pan-European eGovernment services as an important purpose of SEMIC.eu. According to the website, the initial idea behind SEMIC.eu was “to make use of the knowledge already generated in other projects to the benefit of others”.  As a network of eGovernment projects and communities, SEMIC.eu was open for participation to all stakeholders in the field of public services and eGovernment. The projects involved provided and re-used solutions for seamless data interchange, preserving the original meaning of the data. Data exchange methods were provided by stakeholders, harmonised and pooled. SEMIC.eu was also described as an implementation-oriented preparation for standardisation measures. Built upon its function as a facilitator of European harmonisation, the centre participated in international standardisation organisations. Another objective highlighted by the European Commission is the provision of scientific as well as practical information on all matters related to semantic interoperability.

== Platform, repository and service ==
The website www.semic.eu was built around a repository of real-life solutions labelled as 'interoperability assets' ([[XML schemas]], code lists, [[ontologies]], [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]], classification schemes, etc.) provided by projects and organisations in the sector. For instance, various French ministries and the Danish Telecom agency provided developed solutions. 

The assets were subject to a standardised and supervised clearing process to ensure conformity with high quality standards. This involved peer review and incremental enhancement of the assets. However, they remained available at all stages of the process, making it possible to reuse them in different projects, contexts or domains at any time. Moreover, each asset contained a forum thread.

The Supreme Court struck down Section 66A of the [[Information Technology Act, 2000]], relating to restrictions on online speech, unconstitutional on grounds of violating the freedom of speech guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the [[Constitution of India]]. The Court further held that the Section was not saved by virtue of being 'reasonable restrictions' on the freedom of speech under Article 19(2). The case was a watershed moment for online free speech in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indconlawphil.wordpress.com/2015/03/26/the-striking-down-of-section-66a-how-indian-free-speech-jurisprudence-found-its-soul-again/|title=Gautam Bhatia, The Striking Down of Section 66A|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{Main article|Information Technology Act, 2000#Section 66A and restriction of free speech}}

Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, made it a punishable offence for any person to

''"send, by means of a computer resource or a communication device,—''

''(a) any information that is grossly offensive or has menacing character; or''

''(b) any information which he knows to be false, but for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred or ill will, persistently by making use of such computer resource or a communication device,''

''(c) any electronic mail or electronic mail message for the purpose of causing annoyance or inconvenience or to deceive or to mislead the addressee or recipient about the origin of such messages,"''

The vague and arbitrary terms used in the Section led to much misuse of both personal and political nature, with several criminal cases being instituted against innocuous instances of online speech, including political commentary and humour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/section-66-a-instances-of-alleged-abuse-on-social-media/|title=Section 66A: Seven instances of alleged abuse on social media|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Indian Express|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, Section 79 of the IT Act and the Rules made thereunder,&lt;ref&gt;Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011, (http://dispur.nic.in/itact/it-intermediaries-guidelines-rules-2011.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; which created an onerous liability regime for internet [[Intermediaries]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cis-india.org/internet-governance/intermediary-liability-in-india.pdf|title=Intermediary Liability in India|last=Dara|first=Rishabh|date=|website=Centre for Internet and Society|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;were also challenged in a series of writ petitions before the Supreme Court, which were clubbed together and heard by a bench consisting of Justices Chelameswar and Nariman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sflc.in/supreme-court-hearing-on-it-act-petitions/|title=Supreme Court hearing on IT Act petitions|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Software Freedom Law Centre India|access-date=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judgement ==
In a 52-page judgement, which extensively discussed Indian, English and US jurisprudence on free speech, the Supreme Court struck down Section 66-A of the Information Technology Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Information Technology Act|url=http://nyaaya.in/law/739/the-information-technology-act-2000/|website=http://nyaaya.in|accessdate=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; read down Section 79 of the Information Technology Act and the related rules, and affirmed the constitutionality of Section 69A of the Act.

Speaking for the Court, Justice Nariman discussed the various standards which are applicable to adjudge when restrictions on speech can be deemed reasonable, under Article 19(2) of the Indian Constitution. The Court held that Section 66-A was vague and over-broad, and therefore fell foul of Article 19(1)(a), since the statute was not narrowly tailored to specific instances of speech which it sought to curb. Importantly, the Court also considered the 'chilling effect' on speech caused by vague and over-broad statutory language as a rationale for striking down the provision. Further, the Court held that the 'public order' restriction under Article 19(2) of the Constitution would not apply to cases of 'advocacy', but only to 'incitement', specifically incitement which has a proximate relation to public disorder.

Of the challenge on the grounds under [[Article 14 of the Constitution of India]], the Court held that ''"we are unable to agree with counsel for the petitioners that there is no intelligible differentia between the medium of print, broadcast and real live speech as opposed to speech on the internet. The intelligible differentia is clear – the internet gives any individual a platform which requires very little or no payment through which to air his views."'' &lt;ref&gt;Para 98, Shreya Singhal v Union of India&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court further read down Section 79 and Rule 3(4) of the Intermediaries Guidelines, under the Act, which deals with the liability of intermediaries, mostly those which host content and provide online services. Whereas the Section itself uses the term 'receiving actual knowledge',  of the illegal material as the standard at which the intermediary is liable for removing content, the Court held that it must be read to mean knowledge received that a Court order has been passed asking it to take down the infringing material.

Finally, the Court also upheld the secret blocking process under Section 69A of the Act, by which the Government can choose to take down content from the Internet, holding that it did not suffer from the infirmities in Section 66A or Section 79, and is a narrowly drawn provision with adequate safeguards.

== Significance ==

While the decision of the Supreme Court is of immense significance in protecting online free speech against arbitrary restrictions, Section 66A, which was declared unconstitutional, has continued to be used as a punitive measure against online speech in several cases. 

The reading down of Section 79 of the IT act by the Supreme Court, to include the requirement that a takedown notice must be sanctioned by a court or government authority, has also been interpreted by the Delhi High Court in the case of MySpace v. Super Cassettes, to not apply to cases of copyright infringement under the Indian Copyright Act.

{{Redirect|Stand your ground||Stand Your Ground (disambiguation)}}
{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2014}}

A '''stand-your-ground law''' (sometimes called "'''line in the sand'''" or '''"no duty to retreat" law''') establishes a right by which a person may defend one's self or others ([[right of self-defense]]) against threats or [[perceived threats]], even to the point of applying [[lethal force]], regardless of whether safely retreating from the situation might have been possible. Such a law typically states that an individual has no [[duty to retreat]] from any place where they have a lawful right to be&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Florida Statutes Title XLVI Chapter 776&lt;/ref&gt; (though this varies from state to state) and that they may use any level of force if they reasonably believe the threat rises to the level of being an imminent and immediate threat of serious bodily harm and/or death. 

The laws as described in this article are mainly focused on American state legislation adopted since 2005. Prior to that date, states tended to follow [[jurisdiction of England and Wales|English]] [[common law]] which has a stand-your-ground law rooted in the concept of using '[[reasonable force]]' in self-defence.

Stand-your-ground laws in the United States were created to provide a [[Justification (jurisprudence)|defense]] in [[criminal case]]s. In ''[[Dawkins v. State]]'' (2011) the court describes "[T]he 'stand your ground' law... provide[s] that a person has a right to expect absolute safety in a place they have a right to be, and may use deadly force to repel an intruder... for a person to be justified in using deadly force, the person must not be 'engaged in unlawful activity".&lt;ref name=DS&gt;''[[Dawkins v. State]]'', 252 P.3d 214 (Okla. 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Justification using stand-your-ground laws may be limited when "[the defendant] was engaged in illegal activities and not entitled to benefit from provisions of the 'stand your ground' law". This may be the case even if the illegal conduct the defendant was engaged in had nothing to do with the threat which instigated his use of [[deadly force]]. For instance, as is the case in Dawkins v. State, using an illegally obtained weapon in self defense to avoid being robbed and beaten is not justified by this law.&lt;ref name=DS/&gt;

The [[castle doctrine]] is a common law doctrine stating that persons have no duty to retreat in their home, or "castle", and may use reasonable force, including deadly force, to defend their property, person, or another. Outside of the abode, however, a person has a duty to retreat, if possible, before using deadly force. Castle doctrine and "stand-your-ground" laws are acceptable defenses for people who have been charged with criminal homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cga.ct.gov/2012/rpt/2012-R-0172.htm|title=The Castle Doctrine and Stand-Your-Ground Law|last=Randall|first=Mark|last2=DeBoer, Hendrick|date=April 24, 2012|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At common law, [[self-defence|self-defense]] claims are not valid if the defendant could have ''safely retreated'' from danger (duty to retreat). The castle doctrine is an exception to this. It gives immunity from liability to individuals who acted in self-defense ''in the home'' even if they could have safely retreated from the threat and failed to do so. The duty to retreat is a legal requirement in some jurisdictions that a threatened person cannot stand one's ground and apply lethal force in self-defense, but must retreat to a place of safety instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_to_retreat|title=Duty to Retreat|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikipedia|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=December 2017}} Deadly force or lethal force is force with the intent of serious bodily injury or death to another person. In most jurisdictions it is only accepted under conditions of extreme necessity and last resort.

States that have adopted stand-your-ground, but limit it to only when a person is within their vehicle, are North Dakota, Ohio, and Wisconsin.

The states that have castle doctrine only with the duty to retreat in public are Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. This means that people can use deadly force in their home, car, or other form of abode but have to retreat in public.

Vermont and Washington, D.C. require citizens to flee from criminal assailants, even within their own homes.

===Controversy===
Stand-your-ground laws are frequently labeled "shoot first" laws by opposition groups, including the [[Brady Campaign|Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence]].&lt;ref name="MSNBC Travon Martin"/&gt; In Florida, self-defense claims tripled in the years following enactment.&lt;ref name="MSNBC Travon Martin"&gt;{{cite news |title=Florida 'Stand Your Ground' law could complicate Trayvon Martin teen shooting case |date=March 20, 2012 |work=MSNBC |url= http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/03/20/10780286-florida-stand-your-ground-law-could-complicate-trayvon-martin-teen-shooting-case |accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://miami.cbslocal.com/2012/03/20/deaths-nearly-triple-since-stand-your-ground-enacted/ |title=Deaths Nearly Triple Since 'Stand Your Ground' Enacted |publisher=CBS Miami|date=2011-03-20 |accessdate=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents argue that Florida's law makes it potentially more difficult to prosecute cases against individuals who commit a crime and claim self-defense. Before passage of the law, Miami police chief [[John F. Timoney]] called the law unnecessary and dangerous in that "[w]hether it's trick-or-treaters or kids playing in the yard of someone who doesn't want them there or some drunk guy stumbling into the wrong house, you're encouraging people to possibly use deadly physical force where it shouldn't be used."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Goodnough| first=Abby|title=Florida Expands Right to Use Deadly Force in Self-Defense| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/27/national/27shoot.html?_r=1|accessdate=March 23, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]. nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodman|first=Howard|title=NRA's Behind-the-Scenes Campaign Encouraged 'Stand Your Ground' Adoption|url=http://fcir.org/2012/03/23/nras-behind-the-scenes-campaign-encouraged-stand-your-ground-adoption-across-the-country/|accessdate=March 23, 2012|newspaper=[[Florida Center for Investigative Reporting]]. fcir.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A counter argument is that implementing a duty-to-retreat places the safety of the criminal above a victim's own life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/can-women-stand-their-ground|title=Can Women Stand Their Ground?

In Florida, a partisan task force created by former Democratic state Sen. Chris Smith of Fort Lauderdale found the law to be "confusing".&lt;ref name="grio"&gt;{{cite news |title=Trayvon Martin case: Florida task force told 'stand your ground' law confusing |date=April 6, 2012 |work=TheGrio |url=http://www.thegrio.com/specials/trayvon-martin/trayvon-martin-case-florida-task-force-told-stand-ground-law-confusing.php |accessdate=April 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those discussing issues with the group included Buddy Jacobs, a lawyer representing the Florida Prosecuting Attorneys Association. Jacobs recommended the law's repeal, stating that modifying the law would not fix its problems.  In a July 16, 2013 speech in the wake of the jury verdict [[State of Florida vs. George Zimmerman|acquitting George Zimmerman of charges]] stemming from the shooting death of [[Trayvon Martin]], Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] criticized stand-your-ground laws as "senselessly expand[ing] the concept of self-defense and sow[ing] dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holder|first=Eric|title=Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Attorney General Eric Holder at the NAACP Annual Convention|url=http://legaltimes.typepad.com/files/holder-naacp.pdf|accessdate=July 16, 2013|authorlink=Eric Holder}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The defendant, George Zimmerman, claimed he was restrained at the time of the shooting, thus allowing no option for retreat and making 'stand your ground' irrelevant to the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jacob Sullum&lt;!--|Jul. 15, 2013 4:36 pm--&gt; |url=http://reason.com/blog/2013/07/15/zimmermans-prosecutors-did-not-think-the |title=Zimmerman's Prosecutors Did Not Think They Were Trying a 'Stand Your Ground' Case - Hit &amp; Run |publisher=Reason.com |date=2013-07-15 |accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects on crime ===
A 2018 RAND Corporation overview of existing research concluded that "there is moderate evidence that stand-your-ground laws may increase homicide rates and limited evidence that the laws increase firearm homicides in particular." As a result, the research paper recommended that Congress "consider lifting current restrictions in appropriations legislation that limit research funding and access to data ... [and that] the administration should invest in firearm research ... [which includes] "defensive gun use".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018|others=Morral, Andrew R., Ramchand, Rajeev, Smart, Rosanna, Gresenz, Carole Roan, Cherney, Samantha, Nicosia, Nancy|title=The Science of Gun Policy|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2088.html|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justifiable homicides have been found to have increased by 8 percent in states with stand-your-ground laws.&lt;ref name="CSM" /&gt; Economist [[John Lott]] says that states adopting stand-your-ground/castle doctrine laws reduced murder rates by 9 percent and overall violent crime by 11 percent, and that occurs even after accounting for a range of other factors such as national crime trends, law enforcement variables (arrest, execution, and imprisonment rates), income and poverty measures, demographic changes, and the national average changes in crime rates from year-to-year and average differences across states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=More Guns Less Crime | author=Lott, John | quote=Table 10.14 "Time impact of the Castle Doctrine on violent crime rates"}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that the adoption of stand-your-ground laws caused a statistically significant increase in the raw homicide rate, and had only a very small positive effect on deterrence of crime.

A 2012 analysis of stand-your-ground laws by economists at [[American University]], using monthly data from the [[National Center for Health Statistics#National Vital Statistics System|U.S. Vital Statistics]], found a significant increase in homicide and injury of whites, especially white males. They also analyzed data from the [[Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project|Health Care Utilization Project]], which revealed significantly increased rates of emergency room visits and hospital discharges related to gun injuries in states which enacted these laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McClellan |first1=Chandler |first2=Erdal |last2=Tekin |title=Stand Your Ground Laws, Homicides, and Injuries |year=2017 |journal=[[Journal of Human Resources]] |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=621–653 |doi=10.3368/jhr.52.3.0613-5723R2 }} (Original version available [http://www.nber.org/papers/w18187 here].)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 National District Attorneys Association symposium, numerous concerns were voiced that the law could increase crime. This included criminals using the law as a defense for their crimes, more people carrying guns, and that people would not feel safe if they felt that anyone could use deadly force in a conflict. The report also noted that the misinterpretation of clues could result in use of deadly force when there was, in fact, no danger. The report specifically notes that racial and ethnic minorities could be at greater risk because of negative stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://apainc.org/files/DDF/Castle%20Doctrine.pdf|title = Expansions to the Castle Doctrine: Implications for Policy and Practice|accessdate=June 28, 2013 |format = PDF|first = Steven|last = Jansen|first2 = M.

Florida's stand-your-ground law went into effect on October 1, 2005. Florida state representative [[Dennis Baxley]], an author of the law, said that the violent crime rate has dropped since the enactment of the law, though he said there may be many reasons for the change.

In 2012, a study was published which found that after the [[Joe Horn shooting controversy]] in 2007 publicized Texas' stand-your-ground law, burglaries decreased significantly in [[Houston]], but not in [[Dallas]], over a 20-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ren|first1=L.|last2=Zhang|first2=Y.|last3=Zhao|first3=J.

A 2013 study in the ''[[Journal of Human Resources]]'' claims that Stand Your Ground laws in states across the U.S. contribute to 600 additional homicides a year.  According to Mark Hoestra, co-author of the study: "We asked what happened to homicide rates in states that passed these laws between 2000 and 2010, compared to other states over the same time period. We found that homicide rates in states with a version of the Stand Your Ground law increased by an average of 8 percent over states without it—which translates to roughly 600 additional homicides per year. These homicides are classified by police as criminal homicides, not as justifiable homicides."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coleman|first1=Christina|title=Kill At Will: Stand Your Ground Laws Contribute To 600 Additional Homicides A Year (DETAILS)|url=http://globalgrind.com/2014/02/14/stand-your-ground-laws-contribute-600-additional-homicides-a-year-details/|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although police officers make up for additional homicides, they are justified.

A widely reported&lt;ref name=crimeresearch/&gt; 2016 study in the ''[[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' compared homicide rates in Florida following the passage of its "stand your ground" self-defense law to the rates in four control states, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Virginia, which have no similar laws. It found that the law was associated with a 24.4% increase in homicide and a 31.6% increase in firearm-related homicide, but no change in rates of suicide or suicide by firearm, between 2005 and 2014. It noted that, "[c]ircumstances unique to Florida may have contributed to our findings, including those that we could not identify," and "[o]ur study examined the effect of the Florida law on homicide and homicide by firearm, not on crime and public safety".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Humphreys|first=David K.|last2=Gasparrini|first2=Antonio|last3=Wiebe|first3=Douglas J.|title=Evaluating the Impact of Florida's "Stand Your Ground" Self-defense Law on Homicide and Suicide by Firearm|url=http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2582988|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.6811}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21713892-florida-saw-sudden-and-sustained-rise-homicide-rate-24-after-introducing-one|title=A study by the Journal of the American Medical Association suggests stand-your-ground laws result in more fatal shootings|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was criticized by gun rights advocate [[John Lott]]'s Crime Prevention Research Center for studying only one state.&lt;ref name=crimeresearch&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://crimeresearch.org/2016/11/misleading-journal-american-medical-association-research-floridas-stand-ground-law/|title=Misleading Journal of the American Medical Association research about Florida's Stand Your Ground Law - Crime Prevention Research Center|date=2016-11-28|newspaper=Crime Prevention Research Center|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gun enthusiast and attorney Andrew Branca, writing in ''[[National Review]]'', criticized the study for not distinguishing between justifiable homicides and murder, and for relying solely on statutory laws while overlooking case law (i.e. Virginia) in determining the data set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/442217/guns-stand-your-ground-law-journal-american-medical-association-study-fatally-flawed|title=What to Make of the New Study of Florida's 'Stand Your Ground' Law|work=National Review|access-date=2016-11-18|first1=Andrew|last1=Branca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was praised by Duke University professor Jeffrey Swanson for its use of other states as controls, saying "[t]hey look at comparable trends in states that didn't pass the law and don't see the effect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Florida Homicide Rate Increased After Passage of 'Stand Your Ground' Law, Study Finds|first1= Gillian|last1= Mohney|date=November 14, 2016|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/florida-homicide-rate-increased-passage-stand-ground-law/story?id=43527659|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other jurisdictions ==

===England and Wales===
{{unreferencedsection|date=June 2018}}
The [[common law]] [[jurisdiction of England and Wales]] has a stand-your-ground law rooted in the common law defence of using [[reasonable force]] in [[self-defence]].

In English common law there is no duty to retreat before a person may use reasonable force against an attacker, nor need a person wait to be attacked before using such force, but one who chooses not to retreat, when retreat would be a safe and easy option, might find it harder to justify his use of force as 'reasonable'.

Any force used must be reasonable in the circumstances as the person honestly perceived them to be, after making allowance for the fact that some degree of excess force might still be reasonable in the heat of the moment. 

It was once thought that in 'householder defence' cases, excessive force would be regarded as unreasonable only if "grossly disproportionate", but that view has twice been rejected by the courts. Grossly disproportionate force can never be reasonable, but lesser force might or might not be, depending on the circumstances. In ''R v Ray'' (2017) the Lord Chief Justice, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said:

"If there is a threat of confrontation in the street, then the option to retreat may be important in determining whether the use of any force was reasonable. In the case of an intruder in the home, however, the option of retreat is unlikely to arise in many cases and therefore the degree of force used, although otherwise appearing to be disproportionate, might nonetheless be assessed as reasonable."

===Canada===

In Canada, as in England, there is no duty to retreat under the law. Canada's laws regarding self defense are similar in nature to that of England, as they center around the acts committed, and whether or not those acts are considered reasonable in the circumstances. The sections of the Canadian criminal code that deal with self defense or defense of property are sections 34 &lt;ref&gt;http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-6.html#h-9 &lt;/ref&gt;and 35&lt;ref&gt; http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-6.html#h-10&lt;/ref&gt;, respectively. These sections were updated in 2012 to clarify the code, and to help legal professionals to apply the law in accordance with the values Canadians hold to be acceptable.

===Czech Republic===

=== Ireland ===
Under the terms of the Defence and the Dwelling Act, property owners or residents are entitled to defend themselves with force, up to and including lethal force. Any individual who uses force against a trespasser is not guilty of an offense if he or she honestly believes they were there to commit a criminal act and a threat to life. However, there is a further provision which requires that the reaction to the intruder is such that another reasonable person in the same circumstances would likely employ it. This provision acts as a safeguard against grossly disproportionate use of force, while still allowing a person to use force in nearly all circumstances.

The law was introduced in response to ''[[Death of John Ward|DPP v. Padraig Nally]]''.

A person who uses such force as is permitted by ''section 2'' in the circumstances referred to in that section shall not be liable in tort with respect to any injury, loss or damage arising from the use of such force.

The force used is only such as is reasonable in the circumstances as he or she believes them to be—

(i) to protect himself or herself or another person present in the dwelling from injury, assault, detention or death caused by a criminal act,

(ii) to protect his or her property or the property of another person from appropriation, destruction or damage caused by a criminal act, or

(iii) to prevent the commission of a crime or to effect, or assist in effecting, a lawful arrest.

It does not matter whether the person using the force had a safe and practicable opportunity to retreat from the dwelling before using the force concerned.

This law does not apply to force used against a member of An Garda Siochána (Irish Police) or anyone assisting them, or a person lawfully performing a function authorised by or under any enactment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5482">A '''structured sale''' is a special type of [[installment sale]] pursuant to the [[Internal Revenue Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|453}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In an installment sale, the seller defers recognition of gain on the sale of a business or real estate to the tax year in which the related sale proceeds are received. In a structured sale, the seller is able to pay [[Income tax in the United States|U.S. Federal income tax]] over time while having the seller's right to receive those payments guaranteed by a high credit quality alternate obligor. This obligor assumes the buyer's periodic payment obligation. Transactions can be arranged for amounts as small as $100,000.

In a structured sale, the buyer pays up-front cash instead of paying over a long period of time, in installments. Some of that cash is used as consideration for a third party assignment company to accept the payment obligation.

The assignment company then purchases an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] from a [[life insurance]] company with high financial ratings from [[A. M. Best]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} Case law and administrative precedents support recognition of the original contract terms after a substitution of obligors.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] Revenue Ruling 82-122, 1982-1 C.B. 80 (Jan. 1, 1982) (amplifying IRS Rev. Rul. 75-457); ''Wynne v. Commissioner'', 47 B.T.A. 731 (1942), at [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12972517751127118267&amp;q=%2247+B.T.A.+731%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,55]; and ''Cunningham v. Commissioner'', 44 T.C. 103 (1965), at [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2628135143133023241&amp;q=%2244+T.C.+103%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,192].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, proper handling of the transaction will help the parties avoid problems with constructive receipt and economic benefit issues.

After Allstate Life stopped taking new annuity business in 2013,{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} other structured sale opportunities arose. In lieu of annuities, United States Treasury obligations held in a trust (treasury funded structured settlements) are used to fund the future cash flows. Some companies use Key Man Life Insurance Policies in place of annuities, which provide the added protection of a death benefit to the seller and a payout that continues long after the seller passes. This arrangement may preferable when the seller is interested in passing wealth to the seller's beneficiaries after death. A Key Man Policy may also pay out more than an annuity in certain circumstances.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

While negotiating the installment payments, the seller is free to design payment streams with a great deal of flexibility. Each installment payment to the seller has three components: return of basis, capital gain, and ordinary income earned on the money in the annuity. Under the doctrine of constructive receipt, with a properly documented structured sale, no taxable event is recognized until a payment is actually received. Taxation is the same as if the buyer were making installment payments directly.

Structured sales are an alternative to a section [[1031 exchange]]. In a 1031 exchange, however, the seller is required to continue to hold some form of property. Structured sales work well for sellers who want to create a continuing stream of income without management worries. Retiring business owners and downsizing homeowners are examples of sellers who can benefit.

The structured sale must be documented, and money must be handled in such a way that the ultimate recipient is not treated as having constructively received the payment prior to the time it is actually made. For the buyer, there is no difference from a traditional cash-and-title-now deal, except for additional paperwork. Because of tax advantages to the seller, structuring the sale might, however, make the buyer's offer more attractive. Because the buyer has paid in full, the buyer gets full title at time of closing.

There are no direct fees to the buyer or seller to employ the structured sale strategy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

'''Alternatives'''

A sales method called the [[Installment sale]] and a [[Monetized Installment Sale]], are variations of the Structured sale and is intended to protect the seller completely from the risk in connection with the buyer's creditworthiness.

There are some confusion when it comes to the subject of Structured Sale and a [[Structured settlement]]. A Structured sale is partially explained above, a [[Structured settlement]] involves the [[Monetization]] of a settlement that might occur from a lawsuit or an agreement to Structure the settlement of an action whereby the beneficiary of that action receives benefits over a period of time.

The structured settlement specialist who implements the transaction is paid directly by the life insurance company that writes the annuity, or by the service provider for the treasury funded structured settlements.

The internal [[rate of return]] is comparable to long term high quality debt instruments.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Internal Revenue Service Private Letter Ruling 150850-07, dated June 2, 2008, confirmed the IRS position the taxpayer does not constructively receive payment for tax purposes until the actual cash payment is made pursuant to a properly drafted non-qualified assignment.

'''Subordination''' in [[banking]] and [[finance]] refers to the order of priorities in claims for [[ownership]] or interest in various [[assets]].

==United States law==
===Subordination of debt===
'''Subordination''' is the process by which a creditor is placed in a lower priority for the collection of its debt from its debtor's assets than the priority the creditor previously had,&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 4th Ed. 1951, defining "subordinate."&lt;/ref&gt; In common parlance, the debt is said to be subordinated but in reality, it is the right of the creditor to collect the debt that has been reduced in priority. The priority of right to collect the debt is important when a debtor owes more than one creditor but has assets of insufficient value to pay them all in full at the time of a default. Except in [[bankruptcy]] proceedings, the creditor with the first priority for collection will generally have the first claim on the debtor's assets for its debt and the creditors whose rights are subordinate will thus have fewer assets to satisfy their claims. Subordination can take place by operation of law or by agreement among the creditors.

===Subordination of security priority===
Subordination is also an issue in the priority of [[security interest]]s in the ownership of property.  For example, in [[real estate]], [[mortgages]] and other [[liens]] on the title to secure the payment or repayment of money usually take their priority from the time they attach to the title.  The purpose of this ordering of priority is to determine, in a [[foreclosure]] resulting from a default, who gets paid first with the sale proceeds from the foreclosure proceeding.  Earlier mortgages or other liens are often subordinated by their holders to later ones in order to accomplish agreed-upon ends.  An example is for the holder of a mortgage on undeveloped land to subordinate that mortgage to a later construction loan mortgage.  The motivation is either the belief that improvement of the land will benefit the first lender or that the first mortgage requires that it be subordinated to a future construction loan.

The ''subordination percentage'' of a security is the percentage of the total capital which is subordinate to the security in question.  Thus, the security will not suffer any losses until after that percentage of capital has been lost.

====Dealer subordinable debt====
In the automotive financing industry, many dealerships are allowed to designate personal loans which are payable to the ownership as subordinable debt. The finance institution and dealership may come to an agreement which allows this debt to stay within the confines of the financial statement and concurrently improve the dealership financial position from a liquidity perspective.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

===Equitable subordination===
[[United States bankruptcy court|Bankruptcy courts in the United States]] have the power and authority to subordinate prior claims on the assets of a bankrupt debtor to the claims of junior claimants based on principles of equity.  This is a remedy called "equitable subordination."&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|11|510}}(c)&lt;/ref&gt; The basis for subordination is usually the inequitable conduct of the prior claimant with respect to junior claimants.&lt;ref&gt; See, e.g., ''Murphy v. Meritor Savings Bank'', [[Case citation|126 B.R. 370, 393, 413]] ([[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|Bankr. D. Mass.]] 1991), in which an [[Leveraged buyout|LBO]] left the corporation with insufficient cash to operate for longer than 10 days.  In that case, the court not only avoided the mortgage securing the LBO debt, but it also subordinated the resulting lender's unsecured claim to the claims of all other creditors of the bankrupt debtor.&lt;/ref&gt;  Equitable subordination can be used to subordinate both secured and unsecured claims.

Executions as the result of [[summary offense|summary justice]] (such as a [[drumhead court martial]]) are sometimes included, but the term generally refers to capture, accusation, and execution all conducted simultaneously or within a very short period of time, and without any trial at all. Under international law, refusal to accept lawful surrender in combat and instead killing the person surrendering ([[no quarter]]) is also categorized as a summary execution (as well as [[murder]]). 

Summary executions have been practiced by [[police]], [[military]], and [[paramilitary]] organizations and are frequently associated with [[guerrilla warfare]], [[counter-insurgency]], [[terrorism]], and any other situation which involves a breakdown of the normal procedures for handling accused prisoners, civilian or military.

==Civilian jurisdiction==

In nearly all civilian jurisdictions, summary execution is illegal, as it violates the right of the accused to a fair trial. Almost all [[constitution]]s or legal systems based on [[common law]] have prohibited execution without the decision and sentence of a competent judge, and the UN's [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) has declared the same:

{{quote|
Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No man shall be deprived of his life arbitrarily.

[The death] penalty can only be carried out pursuant to a final judgment rendered by a competent court.|[[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], Articles 6.1 and 6.2&lt;ref name="ICCPR"&gt;[[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR &amp;ndash; 1966, Article 6.1).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In practice, though, [[extrajudicial killings]] have been performed by police and domestic forces in various countries and times, sometimes under [[martial law]]. It is also performed by armed bands fighting against governments and common citizens.

==Military jurisdiction==

Under [[military law]], summary execution is illegal in almost all circumstances, as a [[military tribunal]] would be the competent judge needed to determine guilt and declare a sentence of death. However, there are certain exceptions to this rule in emergencies and warfare where summary execution is legal.

===Prisoners of war===
Major treaties such as the [[Geneva Conventions]] and [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]], and [[customary international law]] from history, protect the rights of captured [[Regular army|regular]] and [[Irregular military|irregular enemy soldiers]], along with [[civilians]] of enemy states. [[Prisoners-of-war]] (POWs) must be treated in carefully defined ways which definitively ban summary execution, as the [[Protocol II|Second Additional Protocol]] of the Geneva Conventions (1977) states:

{{quote|No sentence shall be passed and no penalty shall be executed on a person found guilty of an offence except pursuant to a conviction pronounced by a court offering the essential guarantees of independence and impartiality.|Second Protocol of the Geneva Conventions (1977), Article 6.2}}

===Exceptions to prisoners of war status===

However, some classes of [[combatants]] may not be accorded POW status, though that definition has broadened to cover more classes of combatants over time. In the past, summary execution of [[pirate]]s, [[spy|spies]], and [[francs-tireurs]]&lt;ref&gt;Ticehurst R (1997-04-30). [http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JNHY The Martens clause and the laws of armed conflict. ] ''Int Rev RC'' #317, @ pp 125&amp;ndash;134. Seen 2010-06-30.&lt;/ref&gt; have been performed and considered legal under existing international law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part7.htm Law Of The Sea].&lt;/ref&gt; Francs-tireurs (a term originating in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]) are enemy civilians or [[militia]] who continue to fight in territory occupied by a warring party and do not wear military uniforms, and may otherwise be known as [[guerrilla]]s, [[Partisan (military)|partisans]], [[insurgents]], etc.

Though these soldiers could be legally jailed or executed by most armies a century ago, the experience of World War II influenced nations occupied by foreign forces to change the law to protect this group. Many of the post-war victors, such as France, Poland, and the USSR, had the experience of resistance fighters being summarily executed by the Axis if they were captured. The war also influenced them to make sure that [[commandos]] and other special forces who were caught deep behind enemy lines would be protected as POWs, rather than summarily executed as Hitler decreed through his 1942 [[Commando Order]].
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1968-034-19A, Exekution von polnischen Geiseln.jpg|thumb|right|Polish people being executed by a German firing squad in [[Kórnik]], October 1939]]

The Commando Order was issued by [[Adolf Hitler]] on October 18, 1942, stating that all [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[commando]]s encountered by German forces in Europe and Africa should be killed immediately without trial, even in proper uniforms or if they attempted to surrender. Any commando or small group of commandos or a similar unit, agents, and [[saboteurs]] not in proper uniforms, who fell into the hands of the German military forces by some means other than direct combat (through the police in occupied territories, for instance) were to be handed over immediately to the [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SD, Security Service). The order, which was issued in secret, made it clear that failure to carry out these orders by any commander or officer would be considered to be an act of negligence punishable under German military law.&lt;ref name="USGPO_translation"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/commando1.htm | title = USGPO Translation of order | publisher = UWE | place = UK | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070618025102/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/commando1.htm | archivedate = 2007-06-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in fact the second "Commando Order",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | place = UK | url = http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/commando_order.htm | title = History learning site | contribution = The Commando Order}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first being issued by Generalfeldmarschall [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] on July 21, 1942, stipulating that parachutists should be handed over to the [[Gestapo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote =...&amp;nbsp;under which parachutists who were taken prisoner not in connection with battle actions were to be transferred to the Gestapo by whom they were, in fact, killed. | publisher = British National Archives | title = CAB/129/28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after World War II, at the [[Nuremberg Trials]], the Commando Order was found to be a direct breach of the [[laws of war]], and German officers who carried out illegal executions under the Commando Order were found guilty of [[war crimes]].

According to Article 4 of the [[Third Geneva Convention]] of 1949, irregular forces are entitled to prisoner of war status provided that they are commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates, have a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance, carry arms openly, and conduct their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war. If they do not meet all of these, they may be considered ''francs-tireurs'' (in the original sense of "[[illegal combatant]]") and punished as criminals in a military jurisdiction, which may include summary execution.

Soldiers who are wearing uniforms of the opposing army ''after the start of combat'' may be considered illegal combatants and subject to summary execution. Many armies have performed this kind of [[false flag]] ruse in the past, including both German and U.S. [[special forces]] during World War II. However, if soldiers remove their disguises and put on proper insignia ''before the start of combat'' in such an operation, they are considered legal combatants and must be treated as prisoners-of-war if captured. This distinction was settled by a military tribunal in the post-World War II trial of [[Otto Skorzeny]], who led [[Operation Greif]], an infiltration mission in which German commandos wore U.S. uniforms to infiltrate U.S. lines during the [[Battle of the Bulge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Law of Armed Conflict: International Humanitarian Law in War | author = Gary D. Solis | page = 432 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn = 0-5218-7088-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under martial law===

Within a state's policy, [[martial law]] may be declared in emergencies such as invasions or insurrections, and in such a case constitutionally protected rights would be suspended. Depending on a state's interpretation of martial law, this may allow police or military forces to decide and carry out punishments that include death on its own citizens, in order to restore lawful authority or for other vital reasons.

Note that this would not include killing a suspect who is directly endangering another's life, which police can always legally do, but rather, executing a suspect under one's control as a punishment. Proving that a summary execution fell under this legal exception would be exceptionally difficult, as one would have to show why a judgment and sentence of death absolutely needed to be meted out on the spot. Hence, these kinds of extraordinary acts are almost always seen as illegal violations of [[human rights]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5178">The '''tanning tax''' is a ten percent federal [[Excise|excise tax]] that the U.S. government requires tanning providers to collect on [[indoor tanning]] services. Tanning service providers must pay the tax each quarter to the [[IRS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/indoor-tanning-services-tax-center|title=Indoor Tanning Services Tax Center|website=www.irs.gov|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ten percent tax must be collected from the client, according to the IRS, similar to the collection of a sales tax.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/excise-tax-on-indoor-tanning-services-frequently-asked-questions|title=Excise Tax on Indoor Tanning Services Frequently Asked Questions|website=www.irs.gov|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The tanning tax originates from passage of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], also known as Obamacare.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanellis/2015/06/15/obamacares-tanning-tax-turns-five/#62c90cb45a83|title=Obamacare's Tanning Tax Turns Five|last=Ellis|first=Ryan|date=2015-06-05|work=|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2016-11-15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax was among 21 new taxes that were included in the law.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-alexander/how-to-fund-obamacare-gim_b_7767568.html|title=How to Fund Obamacare? Gimmicks Like a Tanning Tax Are Not the Answer|last=Alex|first=Paul|last2=|first2=|date=2015-07-10|website=The Huffington Post|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Forbes]]'', the tax was expected to raise $2.7 billion over the first decade. After five years of the tax going into effect, it raised less than $500 million.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Exclusions ==
[[Phototherapy]] services, which the IRS defines as a "service which exposes an individual to specific wavelengths of light for the treatment of dermatological conditions, [[sleep disorder]]s, [[seasonal affective disorder]] or other [[Mental disorder|psychiatric disorder]], [[neonatal jaundice]], wound healing, or other medical condition determined by a [[Health professional|licensed medical professional]] to be treatable by exposing the individual to specific [[Ultraviolet|wavelengths]] of light" are excluded from the tax if they are performed by a licensed medical professional on that professional's premises.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

If tanning services are provided as part of a gym membership that is considered a "qualified physical fitness facility",{{efn|According to the IRS, qualified physical fitness facility "is a facility (i) in which the predominant business or activity is providing facilities, equipment and services to its members for purposes of exercise and physical fitness, (ii) indoor tanning services is not a substantial part of its business and, (iii) it does not offer tanning services to the public for a fee or offer different pricing options to its members based on indoor tanning services."}} the tax is not applicable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Spray tanning services, as well as the purchase of topical creams and lotions, are also excluded from the tax.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Economic effects ==
According to the American Suntanning Association, almost 10,000 tanning salons have gone out of business since the tax went into effect, resulting in the loss of 81,000 jobs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Prior to passage of the PPACA, over 164,000 people worked in the tanning industry. As of June 2015 that number was 83,000. In California, the number of tanning salons dropped in half between passage of the PPACA in 2010 and 2015.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Business owners say the "little-noticed 10 percent tax on tanning in President Barack Obama's health care overhaul has crippled the industry," according to the ''Denver Post''. However, experts say the tanning industry is overstating the tax's effects on jobs and business closings, and that other factors such as public health warning against tanning play into the equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2016/08/20/tanning-industry-blames-10000-salon-closings-on-obamacare/|title=Tanning industry blames 10,000 salon closings on tax in Affordable Care Act|last=|first=|date=2016-08-20|website=The Denver Post|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation ==
In the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]], Congressman [[George Holding]] of North Carolina introduced a bill on June 9, 2015. H.R. 2698, "[[Tanning Tax Repeal Act of 2015|The Tanning Tax Repeal Act of 2015]]" would repeal the ten percent excise tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2698/text|title=H.R.2698 - Tanning Tax Repeal Act of 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=Congress.gov|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and Tarnac==

The original group of nine consists of five women and four men, aged from 22 through 34 at the time of the arrests&lt;ref name="monde1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="monde2" /&gt;, who are generally well-educated.  Coupat was a former graduate student and is a political writer, having contributed to a philosophical journal called ''[[Tiqqun]]''.  Coupat's partner, Lévy, is an [[Archaeology|archaeologist]].  Others have been described as "a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] sitcom actor (Thomas), a distinguished [[Clarinet|clarinettist]] (Glibert), a student [[Nursing|nurse]] (Hallez, an ex-partner of Coupat's) and Benjamin Rosoux, an [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh University]] graduate who runs the (Tarnac's) grocer's shop and its adjoining bar-restaurant."  At the time of the arrests, Deveaux and Hauck were also described as beginning graduate students in [[Sociology|sociology]] and [[English studies|English]], respectively.&lt;ref name="guardian1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="monde1" /&gt;

The nine were part of a larger group of like-minded, [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] young people who sought to relocate to a rural area in order to [[Simple living|live simply]] and [[Commune|communally]], shunning [[Consumerism|consumerism]].&lt;ref name="guardian1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="monde1" /&gt;  Consequently, they scouted locations and settled on Tarnac&lt;ref name="monde1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="radphi" /&gt;, both for its rural setting and also for the similar political orientation of the local residents: in [[Limousin]], Tarnac is part of an area of France which has a long history with [[Communism|communism]] and the [[French Resistance]] of [[World War II]], having successfully avoided [[Nazi Germany|German]] occupation.&lt;ref name="vice" /&gt;{{efn|"In Tarnac (a village proud of its role in the Resistance, and represented by a communist mayor for four decades) a committee of support was set up, conveying a virtually unanimous show of solidarity of the villagers with those arrested." (p. 2.)&lt;ref name="radphi" /&gt;}}  Upon moving in, the group began operating a disused shop and bar, and began community initiatives such as a film club and food delivery services for elderly locals.  The newcomers were generally well-liked by their neighbors.&lt;ref name="vice" /&gt;{{efn|"Across the hill from the farm where Coupat was arrested, Thierry Letellier, the independent mayor of the neighbouring village, tended his sheep farm. He said: "They were my neighbours, helping me on the farm and selling my meat at the shop. They were kind, intelligent and spoke several languages. They were politicised, on the left and clearly anti-capitalist like lots of people here, but they were people active in community life who wanted to change society at a local level first."&lt;ref name="guardian1" /&gt;}}  On the other hand, authorities have rejected this positive image of the group, instead describing them as an anarchist [[Clandestine cell system|terrorist cell]] who sought a rural location as a base of operations and who shunned [[Mobile phone|cell phones]] in order to avoid detection by authorities.&lt;ref name="monde1" /&gt;{{efn|"That many of the Tarnac group didn’t use cell phones only aroused police suspicion further, a fact the French government later menacingly ascribed to their need to avoid detection."&lt;ref name="vice" /&gt;}}

==Legal Case==

From the time of the arrests until 2018, the group had been involved in complex legal proceedings in which the members faced various criminal charges related to terrorism, sabotage, conspiracy, and refusal to submit to [[DNA profiling|biological sampling]].&lt;ref name="monde3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="notbored3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://notbored.org/tarnac-ten.html |title=''Why we will no longer respect the judicial restraints placed upon us'' |last=Burnel, Coupat ''et al.'', a.k.a.

Coupat, who was presumed by the prosecution to be the group's leader, was released on May 28, 2009.&lt;ref name="monde1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lepoint" /&gt;  In late November 2009, a further arrest was made: Christophe Becker, husband of Glibert, was arrested in Tarnac on related suspicions, and released shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="notbored3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="montagne"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lamontagne.fr/tarnac/2009/11/24/tarnac-les-policiers-ont-braque-un-enfant-de-quatre-ans_132167.html |title=Tarnac: "Les policiers ont braqué un enfant de quatre ans" |last=Nicolas |first=Mickaël |date=November 24, 2009 |website=[[La Montagne (newspaper)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|"In the dawn hours of November 27, 2009, the French antiterror police descended into Tarnac once again to arrest a new suspect for the case, a man in his 30s named Christophe, whom the police believed to be close with the Tarnac Nine. Enraged by the arrest, the Tarnac Nine went on the offensive and wrote an acerbic letter to their judges that was published in ''Le Monde'' on December 3, titled ''Why We Will No Longer Respect the Judicial Restraints Placed Upon Us''."&lt;ref name="vice" /&gt;}}{{efn|"Jérémie Assous is one of the defense lawyers for the Tarnac Nine.

The three-day interval appears to reflect French booking procedures per ''La Montagne'', with the true initial date of physical detention (if not legal arrest) being November 24.}}  In response, and in defiance of the judicial supervision with which they were ordered to comply, the nine met and jointly wrote a letter, published in ''Le Monde'' in early December: ''Why we will no longer respect the judicial restraints placed upon us.''&lt;ref name="vice" /&gt;&lt;ref name="notbored3" /&gt;{{efn|''Vice'' reports a publication date of December 3 (2009), while ''Not Bored!'' gives December 4.}}  The group's judicial supervision orders were lifted on December 18, 2009&lt;ref name="lepoint" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vice" /&gt;&lt;ref name="notbored4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://notbored.org/lifted.html |title=Judicial supervision of Julien Coupat lightened |date=December 18, 2009 |website=Not Bored!}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and due to the new arrest, the group are sometimes instead described as ''the Tarnac Ten''.

The prosecution's case was based upon police surveillance of the group, particularly the above proximity of Coupat and Lévy to a site where sabotage occurred.  Further, the group generally (and Coupat specifically) were suspected of being possible members of [[The Invisible Committee|the Invisible Committee]], an anonymous author (or authors) who wrote ''[[The Coming Insurrection]]'', an [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]], anarchist tract originally published in 2007 which admonishes its readers to ''form communes'' and disrupt [[Infrastructure|infrastructure]], reminiscent of the politics and activities which the group were actually engaged in, and also of the specific crimes with which they were accused.&lt;ref name="undercover" /&gt;{{efn|"French police say Coupat was the author of an anonymous tract against capitalism and modern society, ''The Coming Insurrection''."&lt;ref name="guardian1" /&gt;}}  In particular, according to the prosecution, one passage of the book seems to directly anticipate the rail sabotage:  

{{Quote|text=Information and energy circulate via wire networks, fibers and channels, and these can be attacked. Nowadays sabotaging the social machine with any real effect involves reappropriating and reinventing the ways of interrupting its networks. '''How can a TGV line or an electrical network be rendered useless?''' How does one find the weak points in computer networks, or scramble radio waves and fill screens with white noise? |title=  The Invisible Committee, ''The Coming Insurrection'', p. 112.&lt;ref name="radphi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="insurrectionbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="insurrection" /&gt;}}

Over time, the prosecution's case weakened.  As the case progressed, it was asserted that the method of sabotage employed could not have caused injuries, but merely disruption.{{efn|"An SNCF maintenance technician stated that the malicious device 'could not in any way have caused an accident resulting in bodily harm'." —Translated from the French at ''Le Monde'', March 25, 2009.&lt;ref name="monde2" /&gt;}}{{efn|"The sabotage was done with the purpose of stopping the trains and couldn’t have resulted in any injuries or derailments."&lt;ref name="vice" /&gt;}}  Thierry Fragnoli, a [[Magistrate|magistrate]] originally assigned to the case, [[Judicial disqualification|recused]] himself in April 2012.&lt;ref name="monde4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2012/04/04/affaire-de-tarnac-le-juge-fragnoli-obtient-son-dessaisissement_1680169_3224.html |title=le juge Fragnoli obtient son dessaisissement |last=Borredon |first=Laurent |date=April 2, 2012 |website=Le Monde}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|"Thierry Fragnoli, whose lack of impartiality forced him to recuse himself from the case in 2012 after an article was published in ''Le Canard enchaîné''."

In response to the publicity of the arrests, several philosophers came to the support of the nine, including [[Giorgio Agamben]], [[Alberto Toscano]], [[Alain Badiou]], and [[Slavoj Žižek]].&lt;ref name="vice" /&gt;{{efn|"Giorgio Agamben and Luc Boltanski wrote editorials decrying the disproportion and hysteria of this repressive operation. A petition was circulated by Eric Hazan, publisher and friend of Coupat, and signed by Badiou, Bensaïd, Butler, Rancière, Žižek and several others." (p. 2.)&lt;ref name="radphi" /&gt;}}  Further, several international "support committees", on behalf of the nine, "have sprung up across France and in the US, Spain, and Greece".&lt;ref name="guardian1" /&gt;
