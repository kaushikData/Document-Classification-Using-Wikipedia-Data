"'''App Development and Condiments'''" is the eighth episode of the [[Community (season 5)|fifth season]] of ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'', and the 92nd episode overall in the series. It originally aired on March 6, 2014, on [[NBC]]. The episode was written by Jordan Blum and Parker Deay, and directed by [[Rob Schrab]]. The episode marked the series writing debut of Blum and Deay, and the second episode in the series which Schrab directed.

The episode was met with generally positive reviews, with many commenting on the original homages to ''[[Zardoz]]'' and ''[[Logan's Run (film)|Logan's Run]]''; however, despite positive reviews from critics, the episode matched the previous week's ratings with a 1.0 in the 18–49 rating/share, though it improved to 2.79 million viewers – up from 2.56 million viewers the previous week.&lt;ref name=TVByTheNumbers&gt;{{cite news|last=Bibel|first=Sara|title=TV Ratings Thursday: 'Scandal' &amp; 'Grey's Anatomy' Dip, 'The Big Bang Theory', 'The Vampire Diaries' &amp; 'Parenthood' Up, 'American Idol' Hits Low|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/03/07/tv-ratings-thursday-scandal-greys-anatomy-dip-the-big-bang-theory-the-vampire-diaries-parenthood-up/242712/|accessdate=March 7, 2014|newspaper=TV by the Numbers|date=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Shirley ([[Yvette Nicole Brown]]) discovers that Jeff ([[Joel McHale]]) has organized a dinner with the study group without inviting her, which causes a small argument between the two. Dean Pelton ([[Jim Rash]]) interrupts the conversation and introduces two app designers to the study group. Dean Pelton reveals that he is allowing the app designers to beta test their new social networking application, MeowMeowBeenz, using the Greendale staff and students. MeowMeowBeenz allows the user to rate a person between 1 and 5 MeowMeowBeenz.

The app soon becomes extremely popular at Greendale, but Jeff and Britta ([[Gillian Jacobs]]) continue to reject it. Britta attempts to convince people of the app's stupidity, but is unable to get people to listen to her unless she has mustard on her face, which Annie ([[Alison Brie]]) says distracts from Britta's intensity. Jeff eventually caves in and joins the app, after discovering that Shirley has 5 MeowMeowBeenz, which makes her extremely popular amongst everyone on campus and also gives her the ability to influence what people rate others. The campus soon deteriorates into a dystopia, with the Fives and Fours controlling the school, the Threes and Twos serving them, and the Ones being exiled from the school. The group of Fives, made up of Shirley, Abed ([[Danny Pudi]]), Chang ([[Ken Jeong]]), Hickey ([[Jonathan Banks]]) and a party animal named Koogler ([[Mitch Hurwitz]]), realize that the Threes and Twos are becoming suspicious of them, and decide to host a talent show in order to give them hope. Meanwhile, Jeff, who is now a Four, conspires with Britta to enter the talent show and take down the Fives by exposing their oppressive regime.

Jeff performs at the talent show, but instead of exposing the Fives' regime, performs a hilarious comedy act, which gets him voted into the Fives. With her and Jeff's plan ruined, Britta attempts to expose the regime herself, but no one will listen to her. Britta eventually puts mustard on her face, which causes everyone to pay attention to her and agree to revolt against the Fives. Meanwhile, Jeff is initiated into the Fives, but an argument between him and Shirley causes both of them to be voted down to Ones, and exiled from the school. Outside the school, both Jeff and Shirley admit that they became obsessed by the app, and apologize to each other. Jeff and Shirley are eventually let back into the school, and discover that Britta has overthrown the Fives and replaced their regime with her own oppressive regime, where everyone is a One. Jeff reveals to the school that the app's beta test ended  8 days ago and convinces everyone at the school to delete the app. With the app deleted, everyone leaves the school, leaving a powerless Britta alone. The next week, everyone returns to school and the Dean asks that everyone forget the experience, while Jeff and Shirley mend their relationship.

==Reception==

===Ratings===
Upon airing, episode was watched by 2.79 million American viewers, and received an 18-49 rating/share of 1.0/3.&lt;ref name=TVByTheNumbers /&gt; The show placed fourth in its time-slot, behind ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', ''[[American Idol]]'', and ''[[Once Upon a Time in Wonderland]]''; and fourteenth for the night.

===Critical reception===
Critics gave the episode generally positive reviews for its ambitious parody of a futuristic [[dystopia]] created because of a social media application.  The criticism, however, for the episode came for being "messy" and taking narrative shortcuts that may have detracted from the story.  Todd VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' rated the episode a "B" and wrote that the episode felt like the writers "had one good idea somewhere, and then a bunch of other ideas piled on top of it, and, hey, we can get a lot of big stars to appear, so why not? And eventually, the finished product had so much going on that you couldn’t tell what the original impetus for making the movie was in the first place."&lt;ref name=AVClub&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/community-app-development-and-condiments-201914|title=Community: "App Development and Condiments"|publisher=The A.V. Club|first=Todd|last=VanDerWerff|date=March 6, 2014|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VanDerWerff said that it was "probably the weakest episode of the season" despite having a lot of big ideas, some of it wildly funny and impressively original.  He said the episode functioned well as a social commentary on "the ways we try to make ourselves look better on [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and the Internet in general".  The episode worked on a pure plot and character level, wrote VanDerWerff, in exposing our desire to be liked and admired by projecting facsimiles of ourselves in different social media platforms, while subconsciously accepting that those are the versions we want the world to see.  "We are, in some sense, reducing ourselves to fictional characters, less susceptible to pain or anger, at least until people needle at us, and we act as if that needling is directly attacking our core selves, instead of just some projection we’ve made to get more popular online."

Gabrielle Moss of ''TVFanatic'', on the other hand, rated the episode 4.8 out of 5 stars, and relished how a social media app transformed Greendale into "one of the season's most delightful fits of whimsy".&lt;ref name=TVFanatic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2014/03/community-review-apples-to-apples/|title=Community: "App Development and Condiments" Review|publisher=TVFanatic|first=Gabrielle|last=Moss|date=March 6, 2014|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moss wrote how the episode spoofs how we are one "poke" way from a fascist nightmare, with wise elders making Starburns run around dressed like the protagonist-enforcer from the film ''[[Zardoz]]''.  Moss maintained that even though this episode "certainly didn't compare to Abed and Hickey's knock-down fight about the meaning of emotions and selfishness in [[Bondage and Beta Male Sexuality|Episode 7]], Abed's argument – in favor of social networking's capacity to carefully quantify social interaction for the socially maladjusted – was one of the more persuasive explanations in favor of social networking that I've heard."  She wrote how using a "1970s retro-futuristic sci-fi style" was a great way to prove what "appeared on the surface to be an epic take-down of social networking, proves that the episode was actually a takedown of that evergreen topic, human vanity and greed".  She opined that the Community Season 5 is at the show's peak, especially in portraying Britta as "a socialist revolutionary-cum-warlord," and seeing the "show bloom into the complicated, deranged flower that we planted five seasons ago."  But it's not all sunshine and deranged flowers, Moss wrote: "If Community Season 5 has a theme, it's about how we can all become villains  without realizing it, even as we see ourselves as victims in our own stories. The removal of Pierce and the reformation of Chang has left a villainy vacancy at Greendale, and this season, everyone – Shirley is this episode, Abed and Hickey last week, Britta in Community Season 5 Episode 5 – seems to be trying on the crown...and everyone is finding that it fits."&lt;ref name=TVFanatic /&gt;

Brian Collins of ''Badass Digest'' rated the episode a "B+" and wrote how Community is great at swinging between a high-concept episode this week after a toned-down episode the previous week without giving its fans whiplash.  Collins wrote how this was a strong episode for Britta, who had been sidelined in the first few episodes: "[Britta] suddenly sounds more reasonable when she has mustard on the corner of her lip ('It dilutes or distracts from your excessive intensity,' Annie explains), which of course leads to the actress tossing whatever vanity she may have aside in service of a sight gag where she tries to boost her control over her audience by smearing it over her entire face."&lt;ref name=BadassDigest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://badassdigest.com/2014/03/06/tv-review-community-5.08-app-development-and-condiments|title=Community: TV Review: COMMUNITY 5.08 "App Development and Condiments"|publisher=Badass Digest|first=Brian|last=Collins|date=March 6, 2014|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben Umstead of ''[[Twitch Film]]'' gave a mixed review, saying how the episode displayed "interesting experiments in homage, but it was one experiment that didn't fully land".&lt;ref name=TwitchFilm&gt;{{cite news|last=Umstead|first=Ben|title=Review: COMMUNITY S5EP08 "App Development And Condiments" Gets Dystopic|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2014/03/review-community-s5ep08-app-development-and-condiments-gets-dystopic.html|accessdate=March 7, 2014|newspaper=Twitch Film|date=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Umstead wrote how the episode started personally and intimately through an emotional rift between Shirley and Jeff, going "on and off the rails so many times that it was merely close to, but never quite a disaster," and ending with some real meaning between the two.  Umstead praised the episode's homage "to many a Sci-fi flick from the 70s, most notably ''[[Zardoz]]'' and ''[[Logan's Run (film)|Logan's Run]]'', and of course there's a bit of [[H. G. Wells]] style future from ''[[The Time Machine]]''".  Umstead also praised the performance of the "professional party animal named Koogler (played wonderfully silly by ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' creator [[Mitch Hurwitz]])" reigning as a 5 along with Shirley and getting his own ''[[Animal House]]''-themed trailer in the end credits.  But the episode pushed the plot forward at the expense of jokes: "So much of what works or doesn't will rely on your knowledge of dystopic satires or how much you enjoy seeing comedians [[Tim Heidecker]], [[Eric Wareheim]], and [[Jen Kirkman]] as disco-angel stylized 4s."  He writes how the episode is "serviceable" because it "goes so deep in the well of Community emotional tropes, as to then feel a little lazy in execution. It means well, but it also doesn't help that the basic dystopic ideas it homages and satirizes have been so overly homaged and satirized already as prerequisites for dystopic fiction anyway as to feel stale... if cute in a way."  Umstead pokes fun at his own review, ending by saying, "Maybe I should just take a lesson from Koogler and... assume the party!"

[[File:Azerbaijan State Philharmonic Hall 2006.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A different view of the Philharmonic Hall.]]
The '''Magomayev Azerbaijan State Philharmonic Hall''' ([[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]]: ''Maqomayev adına Azərbaycan Dövlət Filarmoniyası''), located in [[Baku]], is the main concert hall in [[Azerbaijan]] built in 1912.

== History ==
[[File:Azerbaijan State Philharmonic Hall, Baku, 2010.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Side doors to the Philharmonic Hall facing Istiglaliyyat street]]

The Azerbaijan State Philharmonic Hall was constructed throughout 1910–1912 at the request of the city elite and designed by the [[Armenians|Armenian]] architect [[Gabriel Ter-Mikelov]] in the [[Italian Renaissance]] (exterior) and [[Rococo|German Rococo]] (interior) styles. Its design was inspired by the architectural style of buildings within the [[Monte Carlo Casino|Monte-Carlo Casino]], particularly l'[[Opéra de Monte-Carlo]].&lt;ref name="pastdays"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.baku.ru/blg-list.php?blg_id=3&amp;id=24875&amp;cmm_id=133&amp;usp_id=0 The Principal City of the Province] by [[Manaf Suleymanov]]. ''The Past Days''. 1990. Retrieved 29 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The society (known as the Summer Center for Public Gatherings prior to 1936) was originally organized as a club for the wealthy of Baku, who attended it for banquets and entertainment. During the [[Russian Civil War]] it served as a place for public rallies.&lt;ref name="pastdays" /&gt; In 1936, the club was reorganized into a residence for the Philharmonic society aimed at promoting [[Music of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani classical and folk music]]. On 11 August 1937 after the building underwent renovation it was named after composer [[Muslim Magomayev (composer)|Muslim Magomayev]].&lt;ref name="azphilo"&gt;{{az icon}} [http://www.philarmonia.az/az/about.shtml The Magomayev Azerbaijan State Philharmonic Hall] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103222403/http://www.philarmonia.az/az/about.shtml |date=January 3, 2007 }}. Official website. Retrieved 29 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the hall was closed down for the more than 8 years for another renovation. However no restoration works were performed for the most part of that period, much to the discontent of many residents of Baku. Azerbaijan's [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Azerbaijan)|Minister of Culture]] explained such delay by the fact that [[underground water]]s had damaged the base of the building over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.baku.ru/pubs/everydaynews/7656_ru.php Out Theatres Had No Luck] by S.Sibirli. ''Ezhednevnye Novosti'' Newspaper. 15 March 2002. Retrieved 30 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there were reports (mainly in the opposition media) that the money provided for the renovation by the government or donated by various prominent musicians (such as [[Mstislav Rostropovich]], a Baku native) was largely misappropriated by the bureaucrats and officials who were in charge of funding the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.transparency-az.org/files/zig54.pdf The Ghost of the Philharmonic Hall]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Ulviyya Sattarkhan.

The opening of the fully renovated building took place on 27 January 2004.&lt;ref name="azphilo" /&gt; The opening ceremony of the newly-renovated building was held on January 27, 2004. Several famous people attended the ceremony like President Ilham Aliyev, former minister of culture Polad Bulbuloglu, outstanding cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, professor Ferhad Badalbayli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://az.wikipedia.org/wiki/Az%C9%99rbaycan_D%C3%B6vl%C9%99t_Filarmoniyas%C4%B1|title=Azərbaycan Dövlət Filarmoniyası|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}}

{{About|the Australian expression|the building nicknamed the Black Stump|Grenfell Centre}}

[[File:MundubberaBlackStump.JPG|thumb|The "Black Stump" at [[Mundubbera, Queensland]], a concrete structure]]
The Australian expression ''''black stump'''' is the name for an imaginary point beyond which the country is considered remote or uncivilised, an abstract marker of the limits of established settlement. The origin of the expression, especially in its evolved use as an imaginary marker in the landscape, is contested. The various claims are discussed below.

The term "Black stump" was used as land markers on a surveyors plan and was first referred to as a boundary marker in a [[New South Wales]] court case involving a land law dispute. See R v West [1831] NSWSupC 66 (12 October 1831). The case refers to vacant land at [[Woolloomooloo]] where a surveyor had difficulty in ascertaining the boundaries as he could not find a plan from the days of Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]].  In the case it stated, "...and he pointed to some old stumps, which he said had been marked...defendant would not admit that the cross line marked by me on the plan was not part of his boundary...he said it ran to a black stump beyond the line, which he said had been marked...; he said the line was to run somewhere thereabouts; utmost extent claimed by defendant was the black stump of which I have spoken...made no claims beyond South Head road..."

One theory states that the expression derives from the use of black stumps in the landscape as markers when directing travellers. Other explanations relate to historical events associated with places or geographical features with names incorporating the phrase "black stump". At least three regional Australian towns claim the expression originated in their general vicinity.

==Vernacular formulations==
The term 'black stump' is used in various formulations.  The most common are:

*‘beyond the black stump’ or ‘back of the black stump’
: in the outback; remote from civilisation.
:: The following quote from John Wynnum’s ''I’m a Jack, all Right'' (1967; p. 18) conveys this meaning: “It’s way back o’ Bourke.  Beyond the Black Stump.  Not shown on the petrol station maps, even.”    In 1956 British novelist Neville Shute published "Beyond the Black Stump", a novel set in the 1940/50s, contrasting the social mores of a still remote Western Australian sheep station and a small town in Oregon, USA, which still thought of itself as a frontier town despite the Cadillac dealership and the fast food joint.
*‘this side of the black stump’
: in the world known to the speaker; anywhere in the general community.
:: The following is from ''Vision Splendid'' by Tom Ronan (1954; p. 264): “You’re looking... at the best bloody station bookkeeper this side of the black stump.”&lt;ref&gt;Ramson, W.S. (ed.), ''The Australian National Dictionary: A Dictionary of Australianisms on Historical Principals'', Oxford University Press, 1988, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another use of the phrase ‘black stump’ in the Australian vernacular, which relates more to the real object than an abstract concept of landscape, is the local term for the old State Office Block in Sydney (now demolished). The high-rise building was dark-grey in colour and Sydney residents – “with the local talent for belittling anything that embarrassed them with its pretensions” – dubbed it ‘the Black Stump’.&lt;ref&gt;Ramson ''op. cit''.; quote from ''Helga’s Web'' by John Cleary (1970; p. 263).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The most prosaic explanation for the origin of ‘black stump’ derives from the general use of fire-blackened tree-stumps as markers when giving directions to travellers unfamiliar with the terrain. An early use of the phrase from the Sydney journal ''Bulletin'' (31 March 1900, p.&amp;nbsp;31) seems to lend support to this explanation: “A rigmarole of details concerning the turns and hollows, the big tree, the dog-leg fence, and the black stump”.

[[Robbery Under Arms]], a fictionalised work by [[Rolf Boldrewood]] first published in 1888, refers to the Black Stump as an actual place "within a reasonable distance of Bathurst" and known to everybody for miles around. Boldrewood says it "had been a tremendous old Ironbark tree- nobody knew how old, but it had had its top blown off in a thunderstorm, and the carriers had lighted so many fires against the roots of it that it had been killed at last, and the sides were as black as a steamer's funnel."

[[Raffaello Carboni]] used the phrase 'black-stump' in his account of the [[Eureka Stockade]] uprising which he wrote in 1855, probably referring to a well-worn pipe: "Please, give me a dozen puffs at my black-stump, and then I will proceed to the next chapter".&lt;ref&gt;''Eureka Stockade'', original account by Raffaello Carboni (first published 1 December 1855), Dolphin Press, 1947, p. 41; {{gutenberg author|id=Raffaello+Carboni|name=Raffaello Carboni}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There appears to be no obvious link between the use of the phrase by Carboni and the expression being used as an imaginary marker in the landscape.

The evolution of meaning of the phrase 'black stump', from the real to an imaginary marker of landscape, probably occurred during the nineteenth century. There is a widespread belief that the expression took root amongst [[Bullocky|carriers or teamsters]] that operated in the regional districts of Australia. Carriers were an integral part of the rural economy during the nineteenth century; they transported wool and supplies by drays drawn by horse- or bullock-teams, travelling constantly across the landscape servicing stations and settlements distant from regional transport hubs and urban centres.

If the use of the expression 'black stump' entered the Australian vernacular in the nineteenth century, it rarely appeared in Australian literature or newspaper reports until the twentieth century. 
 
At least three towns in regional Australia claim to be home to ''the'' 'black stump': Coolah, NSW; Merriwagga and Gunbar in NSW; and Blackall in Queensland.

===Coolah, NSW===
[[File:Coolah Black Stump Hotel 001.JPG|thumb|The Black Stump Inn in Coolah]]
The area just north of present-day [[Coolah, New South Wales|Coolah]] was known by local Aborigines as 'Weetalibah-Wallangan', apparently meaning "place where the fire went out and left a burnt stump". In an attempt to control the settlement patterns of the colony of New South Wales [[Ralph Darling|Governor Darling]] issued regulations in 1829 limiting settlement in the colony to land within the Nineteen Counties surrounding Sydney. The regulations defined the "limits of location", and it is claimed this boundary passed "along the approximate location of the Black Stump Run" (located just north-west of present-day Coolah). Land to the north of this part of Governor Darling's boundary (it is asserted) began to be described as "beyond the Black Stump".

This raises the question: had the Black Stump Run been taken up by 1829 (or at least by the mid-1830s)? Darling’s “limits of location” was a short-lived concept; in 1836 [[Richard Bourke|Governor Bourke]] allowed individuals occupying lands beyond the Nineteen Counties to obtain annual licenses to legitimise their activities and the "limits of location" became officially irrelevant.

In a list of persons who obtained licences to depasture stock beyond the limits of location in the district of Bligh for the year ending 30 June 1847 appears the entry "Launt Joseph ... The Black Stump".&lt;ref&gt;New South Wales Government Gazette, 28 May 1847 (No.47), page 573&lt;/ref&gt;  Archival research may produce earlier references.

In May 1851 a notice was published by James M’Cubbin of Coolah,  warning against trespassing by cattle or persons on his run “THE BLACK STUMP” in the district of Bligh. &lt;ref&gt;''Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser'', 21 May 1851, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1885, the Black Stump run had been consolidated with the Queensborough run into the Queensborough Pastoral Holding of some 46,000 acres. &lt;ref&gt;William Hanson, ''The Pastoral Possessions of New South Wales'', Gibbs, Shallard &amp; Co, 1889, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; The name lived on in local usage, and there are currently three place names in the vicinity of the original run approved by the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales, i.e. Black Stump Graveyard/Cemetery, Black Stump Creek and Black Stump Resting Place.

Apparently a teamster named John Higgins took up land in the vicinity of the Black Stump Run (possibly in the early 1860s when [[John Robertson (New South Wales Premier)|Robertson]]'s Land Bills allowed land selection to occur). Higgins built an inn in the 1860s which he called The Black Stump Inn, located at the junction of roads leading to Gunnedah and Coonabarabran. The inn later became the Black Stump Wine Saloon and was destroyed by fire in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coolahcp.com.au/black_stump.htm The Black Stump (Coolah)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820063146/http://www.coolahcp.com.au/black_stump.htm |date=20 August 2006 }} retrieved 28 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the saloon was an important staging post for traffic to north-west New South Wales and it became a marker by which people gauged their journeys.&lt;ref name="SMHOutback2005"&gt;{{cite news | last = Lewis | first = Daniel | authorlink =   | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/outback/outer-limits/2005/05/16/1116095894531.html | title= Outer limits  | work=Travel  | publisher= [[Sydney Morning Herald]]   | date= 17 May 2005  | accessdate= 30 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merriwagga / Gunbar, NSW===
[[File:Merriwagga Black Stump Monument.JPG|thumb|Black stump monument at Merriwagga]]
The village of [[Merriwagga, New South Wales|Merriwagga]] and nearby community of [[Gunbar, New South Wales|Gunbar]], in the Riverina district of New South Wales, have strong claims to the origin of the expression 'black stump'. Gunbar cemetery is the burial-place of Mrs. Barbara Blain, the woman whose accidental death in March 1886 possibly gave rise to the term.

Barbara Blain's husband, James, was a carrier or teamster, based at Hay. In March 1886 James and Barbara Blain, in company with other carriers, stopped to camp at a pine ridge on "Gunbar" station. James and the other men left to load posts onto their drays and Barbara began preparations for the evening meal. When they returned, the men found Mrs. Blain had been fatally burnt, probably after her dress had caught alight from the flames of the camp-fire. Barbara Blain was buried at nearby Gunbar cemetery and an inquest into her death was subsequently held. James Blain apparently stated that when he found his wife she "looked like a black stump" (possibly as part of his evidence at the inquest). A watering place near where the tragedy occurred – roughly halfway between Gunbar and the village of Merriwagga – became known as Black Stump Tank.&lt;ref&gt;Death registration – Barbara Blain (Hay 1886); ''Riverine Grazier'' (newspaper), 20 March 1886; Black Stump memorial inscription, Merriwagga, NSW; Register of Inquests by Coroners and Magistrates in New South Wales.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Stump Picnic area at Merriwagga has a waggon and memorial stone, with an inscription which explains the details of these events.

===Blackall, Queensland===
[[File:Black-stump,blackall,qld.jpg|thumb|The Black Stump monument in Blackall]]
The town of [[Blackall, Queensland]] makes the following claim to the origin of the expression. In 1887 a group of surveyors arrived in Blackall (near the centre of Queensland, over 1,000 kilometres west of Brisbane) and established an Astro Station on this site to conduct survey readings to establish a principal meridional circuit traverse around the town. Stumps and other suitable stable platforms were often used rather than a set of legs because they gave more stability to the heavy theodolites then used to take longitudinal and latitudinal observations.

This Astro station was used as part of the survey to fix the position of principal towns extending from Brisbane to Boulia via Roma, Charleville and Blackall and enabled the mapping of Queensland on a more accurate basis.

It was considered at the time that country to the west of Blackall was beyond the 'black stump'.&lt;ref name ="sunzine"&gt;[http://www.sunzine.net/outback/blackall.html Blackall Shire Council] retrieved 24 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A stump of petrified wood which marks the location of the original Astro Station is found at the monument near Blackall State School. This petrified stump replaces the original blackened timber stump destroyed by fire.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackalltambotourism.com.au/blackall-the-black-stump&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackallss.qld.edu.au/blckstump.htm Blackall State School] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060309233939/http://www.blackallss.qld.edu.au/blckstump.htm |date=9 March 2006 }} retrieved 24 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern culture==
'Beyond the Black Stump' is a syndicated cartoon strip, featuring Australian native animals as characters. It is published in papers across Australia including ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'' in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]]. See their web site for more information (including some strips and characters).

The [[Black Stump Music and Arts Festival]] was a four-day [[Christian]] festival that is held in the Greater [[Sydney]] Metropolitan region over the [[Labour Day]] [[long weekend]], often the first weekend in October, from 1985 to 2014.

In Adelaide, the [[Grenfell Centre]], the city's third tallest building, is nicknamed "the black stump".&lt;ref name="emporis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grenfell Centre, Adelaide|url=http://www.emporis.com/buildings/108719/grenfell-centre-adelaide-australia|website=www.emporis.com|publisher=Emporis GmbH|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A restaurant chain has also flourished under the same name, serving popular Australian food, with branches forming as far away as Hong Kong.

In England Laithwaite Wines market a durif/shiraz blend from Casella Wines called "Black Stump".

'''''Brethren''''' is a novel written by [[Robyn Young]] set in the [[Ninth Crusade|ninth and last crusade]]. It was published by [[Hodder and Stoughton]] in 2006. It took her seven years to write the novel where she was "intrigued by the idea of these medieval warrior monks".

==Plot==
The novel describes the fictional story of a young teenager by the name of William Campbell who starts out as a sergeant and later is promoted to a full [[Knight Templar]]. He is tasked with the search of the Book of the Grail which, if ever in the wrong hands, could potentially result in the downfall of not only the Anima Templi (a secret order within the Temple), but also the Temple itself. However, Will finds he's not alone in the search of the book. There are also Prince Edward and The Order of the St John's or the [[Hospitallers]] who want the Book as part of their plans to bring down the Temple.

The story of Will Campbell runs parallel to that of [[Baybars]] Bundukdari, a slave who rose to become Sultan of the [[Mamluk]]s motivated purely by his hatred of the [[Franks]]. In the earlier parts of the story, Will does not know that his father James Campbell is also part of the Anima Templi (or Brethren) and that there is a contact deep within Baybars' circle of trusted advisors who works with the Brethren to achieve long-lasting peace in the [[Holy land]] and the reconciliation of the three dominant faiths of the West: [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]].

The book has a sequel written by the same author. "Crusade" follows Will as he becomes further entangled in the Brethren and Baybars.

==Historical Figures==
The following characters in the book were real historical figures:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

*[[Louis IX of France]]: King of France from 1226 CE to 1270 CE.

==Reception==
The book received a mixed reception from reviewers. In a positive review, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' opined that the novel combines "rich historical detail, clever plotting and engaging characters" to "craft a historical thriller that will have readers turning pages and envisioning the sequel.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-525-94975-6 |title=Fiction Review: Brethren: An Epic Adventure of the Knights Templar by Robyn Young |publisher=Publishersweekly.com |date=24 April 2006 |accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Washburn, of on-line review site ''My Shelf'' praised Young's "steely depictions" of the action in the novel; her "silky style"; and her "engaging story filled with mystery, romance, courage, abandonment and deception.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myshelf.com/mystery/06/brethren.htm |title=Brethren by Robyn Young |publisher=Myshelf.com |year=2006 |accessdate=7 November 2011|first=John|last=Washburn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marie D. Jones, in a review for ''Curled Up'' commented that "you would think Young lived during the times she seems to grasp so well" and found the novel "an exciting read".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curledup.com/brethren.htm |title=Brethren: An Epic Adventure of the Knights Templar – book review |publisher=Curledup.com |date=27 January 2007 |accessdate=8 November 2011|first=Marie D.|last=Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Hubbard, writing for ''Book Reporter'', praised Young's "perfectly crafted" characters, "the strength of her narrative" in a mainly positive review, stating "The majesty, brutality and romanticism of that time are so beautifully painted on the page that it is often difficult to separate the fact from the fiction, and we as readers are dropped into the very center of history to experience the events from within.". Hubbard did, however, comment that he felt the novel sometimes supplied an "overload of information", though "these moments are extremely few and easily can be forgiven considering the strength of the remainder of the work.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hubbard|first=Stephen|url=http://www.bookreporter.com/reviews/brethren-an-epic-adventure-of-the-knights-templar# |title=Brethren: An Epic Adventure of the Knights Templar |publisher=Bookreporter.com |date=23 December 2010 |accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleanor Bukowsky of on-line reviewers ''Mostly Fiction'', offered a more critical opinion of the novel. She states that "although she has the history part down pat, Young is less skilled in creating three-dimensional and believable characters. Her villains are dastardly and her young heroes are callow and long-suffering." and felt that "the book meanders a bit and the finale takes a long time to play out.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mostlyfiction.com/history/young_robyn.htm |title=Robyn Young : Brethren : Book Review |publisher=Mostlyfiction.com |date=26 August 2006 |accessdate=7 November 2011|first=Eleanor |last=Bukowsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was negatively reviewed by ''Boomtron'', with the reviewer stating that the characters "sound awfully modern" and are "too aware of their history and that of other nations", given that "studying such matters was a luxury few could afford". In addition, the reviewer also criticised the novels levels of historical detail, stating that they found the "history lessons superfluous, out of character and quite annoying interruptions in the story.". The review did end on a more positive note, however, with the reviewer saying that "Young has written an engaging story at one level or I wouldn’t have suffered through 600 pages of it" and praising Larry Rostant's cover art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boomtron.com/2008/03/book-review-brethren/ |title=Book Review – Brethren |publisher=Boomtron.com |date=15 March 2008 |accessdate=7 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527150117/http://www.boomtron.com/2008/03/book-review-brethren/ |archivedate=27 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Brickman''''' is a humour [[comic strip]] and character created by UK cartoonist [[Lew Stringer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acesweekly.co.uk/?location_id=6&amp;item=27|title=Aces Weekly|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=British Comics: A Cultural History|first=James|last=Chapman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aMxOPSGZPcwC&amp;pg=PT338&amp;lpg=PT338&amp;dq=brickman+lew+stringer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Kum_LRuoJE&amp;sig=YNk4nLt2BoaiqkEzvsRf-wqGrAs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HHo6UtyhFM3rigKy6YCACA&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwATg8#v=onepage&amp;q=brickman%20lew%20stringer&amp;f=false|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parody of [[Batman]], the spoof features the adventures of zillionaire Loose Brayne and his partner Tina Trowel who fight crime in Guffon City, fighting villains such as the Poker, the Mad Cobbler and Gnat-Woman. The strip's humour uses heavy amounts of puns, sight gags and absurdism.  

The strip began in the [[fanzine]] ''After Image'' No.3 in 1979, before moving on to other [[small press]] fanzines and [[minicomic]]s. ''Brickman'' then turned up in his own title published by short-lived UK independent [[Harrier Comics]] in 1986, featuring guest pages drawn by [[Dave Gibbons]], [[Mike Collins (comics)|Mike Collins]], [[Mark Farmer]], and [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]] (with an introduction written by [[Alan Moore]]). He also made a cameo, alongside discontinued Marvel UK comedy characters in a ''[[The Prisoner]]'' homage, in Stringer's ''[[Combat Colin]]''. 

After a ten-year gap while Stringer focused on his other comic characters, ''Brickman'' was revived in 1996 in the small press comic ''Yampy Tales''; the character returned to a crime-stricken Guffon City to defeat the evil Mr Cheese and his own sidekick Tina, who had gone rogue. In 2005, the Los Angeles publisher [[Active Images]] released a [[digest size]] collection of all the ''Brickman'' stories under the title ''Brickman Begins!'', with a brand-new opening story by Stringer and ''Brickman'' illustrations by guest artists including [[Hunt Emerson]], [[Alan Davis]], [[Tim Sale (artist)|Tim Sale]] and [[Charlie Adlard]].

A new ''Brickman'' series titled ''Brickman Returns'', initially with new strips retelling Brickman's early days and then moving on to modern-day strips set after ''Yampy Tales'', began running as full-colour back-up strips in [[Image Comics]]/[[Active Images]]' ''Elephantmen'' comic in 2006. It concluded in 2009.

==United States==
In the United States and Canada, a '''certificate of attendance''' is a certificate given to students who complete the K-12 ([[kindergarten]] through [[Twelfth grade|12th grade]]) program but do not meet the requirements for the [[high school diploma]] or the modified diploma. 

Students who complete 12th grade but did not obtain enough [[Course credit|credits]], did not complete all core courses, did not pass required testing or did not meet the goals outlined in their individualized program will still be acknowledged in the graduation ceremony; they will walk across the stage in cap and gown, and will look like a graduate. Instead of receiving a diploma, however, they will receive a certificate of attendance.  Some students are encouraged to return to school for either a full year or more (and then to graduate whenever they finish) to make up their credits, pass required testing or meet their goals, and finally obtain a regular or modified diploma.  Some alternative programs allow students to finish in half year provided that they meet certain requirements.  

Some schools do not allow these students to participate in the graduation ceremony.  This is controversial as some students feel that the social benefits of graduation are important.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

===Certification of completion===
Upon completion of a college or university certificate program, students generally receive a '''certification of completion''' or '''certificate of achievement''', not a degree or diploma. Candidates who are enrolled in an institution as full or part-time students may be able to transfer these certificates to degree programs at other institutions.

Students with disabilities who complete the required [[Individualized Education Program ]] but do not meet the requirements of the high school diploma who complete 12th grade may also be awarded a '''certificate of completion'''.

'''Fileteado''' ({{IPA-es|fileteˈaðo}}) is a type of [[artistic drawing]] and [[lettering]], with stylised lines and flowered, climbing plants, typically used in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].
It is used to adorn all kind of beloved objects: signs, taxis, lorries and even the old ''[[colectivo]]s'', Buenos Aires's [[bus]]es.

''Filetes'' (the lines in ''fileteado'' style) are usually full of colored ornaments and symmetries completed with poetic phrases, sayings and [[aphorism]]s, both humorous or roguish, emotional or philosophical. They have been part of the culture of the ''Porteños'' (inhabitants of Buenos Aires) since the beginnings of the 20th century.

The ''filetes'' were born as simple ornaments, becoming an emblematic form of art for the city.
Many of its initiators were European immigrants, who brought from Europe some elements or art, that were mixed with the local tradition, creating a very typical Argentine style.
The fileteado was recognized as an art after 1970, when it was exhibited for the first time.

== History ==
Fileteado began in the gray carts pulled by horses, that transported fruits, milk, groceries and bread at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Tim Fitzgerald "&gt;{{cite news  
| last=  Fitzgerald
| first=  Tim  
| url=  http://www.bbc.com/travel/blog/20121221-learn-a-true-buenos-aires-art-form
| title=  Learn a true Buenos Aires art form
| publisher=  [[BBC]]
| date=  26 December 2012
| accessdate= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painter who decorated the karts was called ''Fileteador'', because he performed the job with long-threaded paintbrushes also called "Brushes for making filetes". This is a word derived from Latin "Filum" which means "Thread", referring to the art in a fine line that serves as ornament.

Since it was something that was executed after a kart was done, but before the payment was received, it was a task that had to be performed quickly.

At that time, many specialist painters surged such as Ernesto Magiori and Pepe Aguado or artists such as Miguel Venturo, son of Salvador Venturo. This last one had been a captain of the Merchant Navy of Italy who established in Buenos Aires, where he dedicated to Fileteado, incorporating a lot of motifs from his home country. Miguel studied painting and enhanced his father's technique, being considered by many the painter who shaped the Filete. The introduction of birds, flowers, diamonds and dragons in the motifs is attributed to him, as well as the design of letters in the doors of trucks. Since there was a tax imposed to very big letters, Miguel made smaller ones but surrounded by very colorful and complex designs to draw attention, design that stood for a long time.

== Main formal features ==
In the book ''Filete porteño'', by Alfredo Genovese, the anthropologist Norberto Cirio describes the main formal features from ''fileteado'' as:
#A high degree of stylization
#The preponderance of lively colours
#The use of shading and highlighting to create the illusion of depth
#The preferred use of a Gothic font style or highly detailed letters
#The almost obsessive recurrence of symmetry
#The framing of each composition when it is finished
#The efficient use of available space
#The symbolic conceptualization of many of the images represented (the horseshoe as a symbol of good luck, the dragon as a symbol of strength).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11771">'''Fira Mediterrània of Manresa''' (Catalonia-Spain) is a performing arts fair rooted in Mediterranean tradition. It has two main areas of focus: '''popular culture''' (based on a dialogue between traditional, regional culture and creative innovation) and '''world music'''. It has been held every year since 1998 and has become a setting for exchange professionals that sell and buy productions.
[[File:AVoreJTomas.jpg|thumb|"A vore" at Fira Mediterrània de Manresa 2015 (Photo: Josep Tomàs)]]
Most activities are open to the public at large and the Fira uses a range of stage areas in the city centre. Despite this, activities exclusively aimed at industry professionals are a cornerstone of the Fira. These include industry conferences, a recruitment place, partnership network meetings and presentations. Together with [[FiraTàrrega|FiràTarrega]] (the international market for performing arts), [http://www.mmvv.cat/en/ Mercat de Música Viva de Vic] (Vic live music market), the [http://www.sismografolot.cat/en/ Sismòfraf] d'Olot, the [http://lamostraigualada.cat/ Mostra d'Igualada] and the [http://www.trapezi.cat/en/ Fira Trapezi], the Fira Mediterrània completes the [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Generalitat]] (Regional Government) of Catalonia’s map of artistic marketplaces in Catalonia.

Fira Mediterrània is part of the [[Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Dialogue Between Cultures|Anna Lindh Foundation]], the [http://www.cofae.net/en/ Spanish Performing Arts Trade Fair Coordinator] (COFAE), the [http://www.efwmf.org/ European Forum of Worldwide Music Festivals] (EFWMF), the [https://www.ietm.org/ International Network for Contemporary Performing Arts] (IETM) and the [https://www.apropacultura.cat/index.aspx Apropa Cultura] program.

==Characteristics==
Fira is an interdisciplinary event and the programme covers all artistic languages – '''visual arts, circus, dance, exhibitions, music, storytelling and theatre'''. The programmed shows are in different formats - small, medium or large-scale - in venues or in the street, aimed both at adult and at family audiences.

'''21st edition will be held from 4 to 7 October 2018.'''

Arts projects can be submitted under two main themes:
* '''Traditional Culture''', based on elements that include the transfer of heritage, the crossover between contemporary creation and traditional regional culture, participation and the increase of the social foundations of culture. Suitable projects: visual performing arts, circus, dance, exhibitions, music, storytelling, theatre, community and/or participatory shows, family shows, among others.
* '''World Music and folk''', traditional or contemporary music that is connected to its local region, with special emphasis on the Mediterranean.
'''Fira Business Area''' is a networking hub for artists, creators, booking agents, cultural agents, public and private institutions, third sector organisations and cultural industry associations. It promotes discussion on new and emerging opportunities from an international perspective, based on themes that include, among others, the relationship between tradition and performing arts, the community, participation, and the benefits to society stemming from cultural initiatives.

For three days, the Fira Business Area becomes a '''nerve centre''' of professional activity, with exhibitions, a professional conference, presentations of cultural projects, showcases, and speed dating and networking events.

An innovative, enriching aspect of these initiatives is the fact that at the Fira, unlike other forums for debate, some of the projects can also be seen on stage.

Professional events are not confined exclusively to the dates of Fira Mediterrània. Throughout the year, Fira Mediterrània also organises other activities, such as roundtable debates and a professional conference.

Fira Mediterrània has an International and National Plan of Action, which aims to increase the event's scope with new areas of initiative and to renew the main existing agreements. Of noteworthy interest is the Euroregional Heritage and Creation Forum project, approved by the European Union, which consists of three agents from [[Occitania]], [[Catalonia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]] that work together to exemplify the social, cultural and linguistic areas they have in common. The Plan of Action also includes the consolidation of agreements with countries such as [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Portugal]], [[Morocco]]  and with regions such as [[Valencia]], the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Aragon]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and [[Castile and León|Castille and Leon]].

Fira Mediterrània Manresa-Catalonia is made possible through the [[Generalitat]] of Catalonia’s Culture Department and [[Manresa]] City Council, which comprise the organising foundation. The main private partner is [https://obrasociallacaixa.org/en/ ‘La Caixa’ Obra Social] (Social and Cultural Outreach Project) and the official sponsor is [[Estrella Damm]].

==Objectives==
* Boosts the implementation and dissemination of national and international projects that fuse contemporary creativity with traditional and regional culture;

== Awards and recognition ==
'''The 'Teresa Rebull' award for the best music production and traditional culture project'''

The '[[Teresa Rebull]]' award for the best music production and traditional culture project is announced by the Generalitat (Regional Government) of Catalonia's Culture Department and Fira Mediterrània. The goal of this award is to promote music projects that take traditional and folkloric culture as their creative basis by contributing to the funding of the production process, as far as arrangements, management and staging are concerned, among other aspects.

The award pays tribute to the career of Teresa Rebull who was a singer, painter and tireless activist of Catalan culture, feminism and Anti-Francoism. She died in April 2015.

'''Recognition in Bogotá'''

Fira Mediterrània Manresa-Catalonia was recognised by the [[Colombia]] Ministry of Culture, the University of Rosario in Bogotá and the [[Ramon Llull Institute]] of Catalonia-Baleares as a cultural practice of excellence, at the Cultural Management Conference held in March 2010 as part of the Ibero-American Theatre Festival of Bogatá. The two Catalan speaking regions were invited to take part in this event as guests of honour.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2168">'''Flour bleaching agent''' is a [[food additive]] added to [[flour]] in order to make it appear whiter (freshly milled flour has a yellowish tint) and to oxidize the surfaces of the flour grains and help with developing of [[gluten]].

==Overview==
Usual flour [[bleach]]ing agents are:
*[[Organic peroxide]]s, namely [[benzoyl peroxide]]
*[[Calcium peroxide]]
*[[Nitrogen dioxide]]
*[[Chlorine]]
*[[Chlorine dioxide]]
*[[Azodicarbonamide]]
*Atmospheric [[oxygen]], used during natural aging of flour

Use of chlorine, [[bromate]]s, and [[peroxide]]s is not allowed in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chlorinated [[wheat flour#Types|cake flour]] improves the structure-forming capacity, allowing the use of dough formulas with lower proportions of flour and higher proportions of [[sugar]]. In [[biscuit]] manufacturing, use of chlorinated flour reduces the "spread" and provides a tighter surface. The changes of functional properties of the flour [[protein (nutrient)|protein]]s are likely to be caused by their [[oxidation]].

In countries where bleached flour is prohibited, plain flour can be treated in a [[microwave oven]] to produce similar chemical changes to the bleaching process. This improves the final texture of baked goods made to recipes intended for bleached flours.&lt;ref name=kate-flour &gt;{{cite web

This is a '''list of musical terms''' that are likely to be encountered in printed scores, [[Music criticism|music reviews]], and program notes. Most of the terms are Italian (see also [[Italian musical terms used in English]]), in accordance with the Italian origins of many European musical conventions. Sometimes, the special musical meanings of these phrases differ from the original or current Italian meanings. Most of the other terms are taken from French and German, indicated by "&lt;abbr title="French"&gt;Fr.&lt;/abbr&gt;" and "&lt;abbr title="German"&gt;Ger.&lt;/abbr&gt;", respectively.

Unless specified, the terms are Italian or English. The list can never be complete: some terms are common, and others are used only occasionally, and new ones are coined from time to time. Some composers prefer terms from their own language rather than the standard terms listed here.

{{Other uses|Greaser (disambiguation)}}
{{For|the British motorcycling subculture of the 1960s|Rocker (subculture)}}

[[File:MHBgreaser.jpg|thumb|right|North American greaser of [[Quebec]], Canada, ''circa'' 1960]]
'''Greasers''' are a [[youth subculture]] that was popularized in the late 1940s and 1950s to 1960s by predominantly [[working class]] and [[American lower class|lower class]] [[teenager]]s and [[young adult (psychology)|young adults]] in the [[United States]]. The subculture remained prominent into the mid-1960s and was particularly embraced by certain ethnic groups in [[urban areas]], particularly [[Italian-Americans]] and [[Hispanic-American]]s. [[Rock and roll]] music, [[rockabilly]] and [[doo-wop]] were major parts of the culture.

== History ==
=== Etymology of the term "greaser" ===
The word "greaser" originated in the 19th century in the United States as a derogatory label for poor laborers, specifically those of Mexican or Italian descent.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=138}}{{efn|The similar term “greaseball” became a slur for individuals of [[Italians|Italian]] descent, though to a lesser extent it has also been used more generally to refer to all [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]], Latin, or [[Hispanic]] people.&lt;ref name="slang"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dalzell|first1=Tom|last2=Victor|first2=Terry|title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|page=1044|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bbcBCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1044&amp;dq=greaseball&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1pMLHk_rYAhXLzVMKHdu3DJkQ6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=greaseball&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maledicta"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aman|first1=Reinhold|title=Maledicta, Volume 7|date=1984|publisher=Maledicta|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wAnqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=greaseball+italian&amp;dq=greaseball+italian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj79PfqlPrYAhVCtlMKHZCwA-w4ChDoAQg8MAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="migrations"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruberto|first1=Laura E.|last2=Sciorra|first2=Joseph|title=New Italian Migrations to the United States: Vol. 1: Politics and History since 1945|date=2017|publisher=University of Illinois Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qauzDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT118&amp;dq=greaseball+italian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibrJumlPrYAhWF2lMKHVZPBp8Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=greaseball%20italian&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The term was later used to refer to mechanics. It was not used in writing to refer to the American subculture of the mid-20th century until the mid-1960s, though in this sense it still evoked a pejorative connotation and a relation to machine work.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=138}}{{efn|[[S. E. Hinton]], author of the novel [[The Outsiders (novel)|''The Outsiders'']], an influential portrayal of greasers, knew the term from her youth in the 1950s.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=139}}}} The name was applied to members of the subculture because of their characteristic greased-back hair.{{sfn|Torres|2017}}

=== Origins of the subculture and rise to popularity ===
The greaser subculture may have emerged in the post-[[World War II]] era among the [[motorcycle club]]s and [[outlaw motorcycle club|gangs]] of the late 1940s, though it was certainly established by the 1950s.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=138}}{{efn|Moore writes that there is ambiguity surrounding the birth of the defining greaser fashion and style, though the associated look is similar to the one displayed by post-war bikers.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=138}}}} The original greasers were aligned by a feeling of disillusion with American popular culture, either through a lack of economic opportunity in spite of the [[Economic history of the United States#Postwar prosperity: 1945–1973|post-war boom]] or a marginalization enacted by the general domestic shift towards homogeneity.{{sfn|Moore|2017|pp=138–139}} Most were male, often ethnic and working-class, and held interest in [[hotrod]] culture or motorcycling.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=138}} A handful of middle class youth were drawn to the subculture for its rebellious attitude.{{sfn|Symmons|2016|p=182}}

The weak structural foundation of the greasers can be attributed to the subculture's origins in working-class youth with few economic resources with which they could participate in American [[consumerism]].{{sfn|Cinotto|2014|loc=Anticipating an Italian American Consumption Culture}} Greasers, unlike motorcyclists, did not explicitly have their own interest clubs or publications. As such, there was no business marketing geared specifically towards the group.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=141}} Their choice in clothing was largely drawn from a common understanding of the empowering aesthetic of working-class attire, rather than cohesive association with similarly-dressed individuals.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=141}} Some greasers were in motorcycle clubs or in gangs (and some gang members and bikers dressed like greasers){{sfn|Moore|2017|p=141}} though such membership was not an inherent principle of the subculture.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=138}}

Ethnically, original greasers were mostly composed of [[Italian Americans]] in the [[Northeastern United States]] and [[Chicanos]] in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]]. Since both of these peoples were mostly [[olive skin|olive-skinned]], the "greaser" label assumed a quasi-racial status that implied an urban lower class masculinity and delinquency. This development led to an ambiguity in the racial distinction between poor [[Italian American]]s and [[Puerto Rican migration to New York City#1950s|Puerto Ricans]] in [[New York City]] in the 1950s and 1960s.{{sfn|Cinotto|2014|loc=Anticipating an Italian American Consumption Culture}} Greasers were also perceived as being predisposed to perpetrating sexual violence, stoking fear among middle class males and a degree of arousal among middle class females.{{sfn|Symmons|2016|pp=181–182}}

=== Decline and modern incarnations ===
Though the television show ''[[American Bandstand]]'' helped to "sanitize" the negative image of greasers in the 1960s, [[Promiscuity|sexual promiscuity]] was still seen as a key component of the modern character.{{sfn|Cinotto|2014|loc=Footnote #56}} By the mid-1970s, the greaser image had become a quintessential part of 1950s nostalgia and cultural revival.{{sfn|Symmons|2016|p=184}}

== Fashion, style, and culture ==
[[File:Young greaser.jpg|thumb|Young greaser in the Southeastern United States, 1956]]
The most notable physical characteristic of greasers were their greased hair styles through the use of products such as [[pomade]] or [[petroleum jelly]]. For males, it was used to fashion coiffures such as the Folsom, [[Pompadour (hairstyle)|Pompadour]], Elephant's trunk, or [[Duck's ass]]. This was probably adopted from early rock 'n' roll and [[rockabilly]]
performers such as [[Elvis Presley]]. Since the hair products weren't sticky and remained wet the hair had to be frequently reshaped via combing so the style could be maintained.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=139}} For females, [[backcombing]] or teasing the hair was common.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=140}}

Male greasers typically wore loose cotton twill trousers (common among the working class) or dark blue [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.|Levi's]] [[blue jeans|jeans]] (widely popular among all American youth in the 1950s). The latter were often cuffed over ankle-high black or brown leather boots,{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=139}} including cowboy, steel-toed [[engineer boot|engineer]], or [[Harness boots|harness]] styles. Other footwear choices included [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]] and [[brothel creeper]]s.{{sfn|Blanco F.|2015|p=137}} Male tops were typically solid black or white [[T-shirt]]s, [[ringer T-shirt]]s, or sometimes [[tank tops]] (which would have been retailed as underwear). Outerwear were either denim or [[leather jacket]]s (including but not limited to [[Perfecto motorcycle jacket]]s). Female greaser dress included leather jackets and risque clothing such as tight and cropped pants like [[capri pants|capris]] and [[pedal pushers]] (broadly popular during the time period).{{sfn|Moore|2017|pp=139–140}}

=== Music tastes ===
In the early 1950s there was significant greaser interest in [[doo-wop]], a black genre of music from the industrial cities of the Northeast that had disseminated to mainstream American music through Italian American performers.{{sfn|Cinotto|2014|loc=Anticipating an Italian American Consumption Culture}} Greasers were also heavily associated with the culture surrounding [[rock n' roll]], a musical genre which had induced feelings of a [[moral panic]] among older, middle class generations during the mid to late 1950s. To many of them, greasers epitomized the connection between rock music and juvenile delinquency professed by several important social and cultural observers at the time.{{sfn|Symmons|2016|pp=181–182}}

== Portrayal in media and popular culture ==
[[File:LA teens.jpg|thumb|Greaser revival look in 1974]]
The first cinematic representation of the greaser subculture was the 1953 film ''[[The Wild One]]''.{{sfn|Gelder|Thornton|1997|p=185}}

Greasers are central characters in the 1957 musical ''[[West Side Story]]'' and its 1961 [[West Side Story (film)|film adaptation]], the 1967 novel ''[[The Outsiders (novel)|The Outsiders]]'' and its 1983 [[The Outsiders (film)|film adaptation]], the 1974 film ''[[The Lords of Flatbush]]'', and the 1979 film ''[[The Wanderers (1979 film)|The Wanderers]]''. The phenomenon was given a more farcical treatment in the 1971 stage musical ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' (along with its 1978 [[Grease (film)|film adaptation]]), which drew its name from the subculture and was based on real-life [[Poles in Chicago|Chicago Polish]] greasers in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bring back our own, original R-rated 'Grease'|url=http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/the_theater_loop/2009/01/bring-back-our.html|accessdate=28 June 2015|date=8 January 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117163229/http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/the_theater_loop/2009/01/bring-back-our.html|archivedate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band [[Sha-Na-Na]] models their on-stage presence on New York City greasers (the band members themselves were mostly [[Ivy League]]rs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/danny-mcbride-guitarist-with-rockn-roll-revivalists-sha-na-na-1773502.html?action=Popup|date=April 10, 2010|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|title=Danny McBride: Guitarist with rock'n' roll revivalists Sha Na Na}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Handle-o-Meter''' is a testing machine developed by [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] and now manufactured by [[Thwing-Albert]] that measures the "handle", ''i.e.'' a combination of surface friction and flexibility of sheeted materials.

Originally it was used to test the durability and flexibility of [[toilet paper]] and [[paper towels]].

The test sample is placed over an adjustable slot. The resistance encountered by the penetrator blade as it is moved into the slot by a pivoting arm is measured.

==Details==
The data collected when such nonwovens, tissues, toweling, film and textiles are tested has been shown to correlate well with the actual performance of these specific material's performance as a finished product.&lt;ref name=handle-o-meter&gt;{{cite web|title=Handle-O-Meter softness testing machine|url=http://www.thwingalbert.com/handle-o-meter.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924024256/http://www.thwingalbert.com/handle-o-meter.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=24 September 2012|publisher=Thwing Albert|accessdate=2 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Materials are simply placed over the slot that extends across the instrument platform and then the tester hits test. There are three different test modes which can be applied to the material: single, double, and quadruple. The average is automatically calculated for double or quadruple tests. 

==Features==
*Adjustable slot openings
*Interchangeable beams
*Auto-ranging
*2 x 40 LCD display
*Statistical Analysis
*RS-232 Output and Serial Port
*Industry Standards:
*ASTM D2923, D6828-02
*TAPPI T498
*INDA IST 90.3

[[File:Wall poem and pub tables, Wilmslow Road, Manchester - geograph.org.uk - 1393195.jpg|thumb|right|Lemn Sissay's poem on the side of the pub]]
'''Hardy's Well''' is a [[public house]] located at the end of the [[Curry Mile]],&lt;ref name="MEN_8Aug2016" /&gt; at 257 [[Wilmslow Road]],&lt;ref name="WhatPub" /&gt; in [[Rusholme]], south [[Manchester]], near to [[Platt Fields Park]]. The 200-year-old building is named after [[Hardy's Brewery]], and was formerly known as '''Birch Villa''',&lt;ref name="MEN_8Aug2016" /&gt; later the '''Birch Villa Hotel''',&lt;ref name="heritagestatement" /&gt; which has existed on the site since 1837. The front of the building has a Hardy's mosaic on it,&lt;ref name="WhatPub" /&gt; and is two storeys high with three bays, built of red brick.&lt;ref name="heritagestatement" /&gt;

Following from a conversation between [[Lemn Sissay]] and the landlord in 1994, it has one of the first [[public art|public poems]] written on one of its gable walls. The poem is known as "Hardy's Well", after the name of the pub.&lt;ref name="Sissay104" /&gt; Sissay went on to display poetry UK-wide.&lt;ref name="MEN_8Aug2016" /&gt;

It was a popular venue for [[University of Manchester]] students, and of [[Manchester City F.C.]] fans when the club was based at [[Maine Road]].&lt;ref name="MEN_8Aug2016" /&gt;

It is owned by [[Enterprise Inns]]. It was listed as an [[Asset of community value]] in 2015 as a result of an application by the [[Rusholme &amp; Fallowfield Civic Society]]. The pub closed in July 2016,&lt;ref name="MEN_8Aug2016" /&gt; and is at risk of being demolished.&lt;ref name="Sissay7Aug2016" /&gt; A planning application by [[Eamar Development]] to turn it into flats and shops was submitted in 2018, which would see the shell of the pub incorporated into a larger building, with the poem on the wall as part of the inside of the foyer as well as replicated on the new building's outside wall. The new building would be 6 storeys tall,&lt;ref name="MEN_20Mar18" /&gt; and contain 62 flats&lt;ref name="heritagestatement" /&gt; with shops on the ground floor.&lt;ref name="MEN_20Mar18" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2618">'''Hawalis''' is a traditional [[mancala]] game played in [[Oman]] as well as [[Zanzibar]], where it is known as '''Bao la Kiarabu''', with slightly different rules. It is closely related to [[Africa]]n mancalas such as [[Bao (mancala game)|Bao]] ([[Tanzania]], [[Malawi]], [[Kenya]]), [[Njomba]] ([[Mozambique]] and [[Malawi]]), [[Lela (mancala game)|Lela]] ([[Democratic Republic of Congo|DR Congo]]), [[Mulabalaba]] ([[Zambia]]), [[Muvalavala]] ([[Angola]]) and [[Tschuba]] ([[South Africa]], Mozambique).

==Rules (Oman)==
Hawalis boards in Oman are composed by 4 rows of 7 holes. At game setup, two seeds are placed in each hole. Each player owns half of the board (2 rows) of the board.

At his or her turn, the player takes all seeds from a hole and [[Mancala#General gameplay|relay-sow]]s them counterclockwise. If there are holes with more than one seed, then the player must sow starting from one such hole. If the last seeds fall in a hole of the inner row and the opposite hole in the opponent's half board is not empty, its contents are captured and removed from the game. If both the opposite hole and that behind it in the opponent's half board are non empty, all seeds are captured from both of them. The game ends when one of the players is left without any seed in his rows.

The winner of the game is the player who captures most seeds.

==Rules (Zanzibar)==
The rules of Bao la Kiarabu were originally transcribed by W. H. Ingrams, who described two variants of the game. One of them is exactly the same as Oman's Hawalis. The other one uses a different board, with 2 rows of 8 holes each (the same board used for [[Bao (mancala game)|Bao]]). This also differs from Hawalis in that sowing goes clockwise, and that seeds from a hole in the outer row are captured even if the corresponding hole in the inner row is empty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4322">'''Historians of the Latter Day Saint movement''' are a diverse group of historians writing about [[Mormonism]]. Historians devoted to the [[history of the Latter Day Saint movement]] may be members of a Latter Day Saint faith or non-members with an academic interest. They range from faith-promoting historians to [[anti-Mormonism|anti-Mormon]] historians, but also include scholars who make an honest effort at objectivity.

==Range of perspective==
Authors of books on "faith-promoting history" are criticized as generally avoiding more controversial topics in an effort to promote [[faith]] among members. This sort of history has generally been endorsed by the leadership of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), and was encouraged by church [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[Dallin H. Oaks]].

:"Criticism is particularly objectionable when it is directed toward Church authorities, general or local. ... Evil-speaking of the Lord's anointed is in a class by itself. It is one thing to depreciate a person who exercises corporate power or even government power. It is quite another thing to criticize or depreciate a person for the performance of an office to which he or she has been called of God. It does not matter that the criticism is true. As President George F. Richards of the Council of the Twelve said in a conference address in April 1947: 'When we say anything bad about the leaders of the Church, whether true or false, we tend to impair their influence and their usefulness and are thus working against the Lord and his cause.' (CR April 1947, p. 24)"&lt;ref name="Oaks 1985"&gt;Dallin H. Oaks, "Reading Church History", Ninth Annual Church Educational System religious Educators' Symposium, August 16, 1985, Brigham Young University.{{full|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Balance is telling both sides. This is not the mission of the official Church literature or avowedly anti-Mormon literature.Neither has any responsibility to present both sides."&lt;ref name="Oaks 1985" /&gt;

On the opposite end of the spectrum are [[anti-Mormonism|anti-Mormon]] historians, which Oaks mentioned in the above quote. Anti-Mormons generally write with the intention of disproving the claims of the LDS Church, sometimes to the point of fabricating lies about the LDS Church.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Though such historians would not be considered Latter Day Saints, they could be considered Latter Day Saint historians as the LDS Church is the topic of their research. Many anti-Mormons are, in fact, non-practicing [[ex-Mormons]] and therefore may still consider themselves [[cultural Mormon]]s.

Other historians reject both faith-promoting history and anti-Mormon history, and seek to give a more [[Objectivity (journalism)|objective]] analysis, basing their conclusions on actual evidence, rather than revealing [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|selective evidence]] to reach their desired conclusions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23734">[[File:Cyrus Cylinder front.jpg|thumb|250px]]
[[File:Cyrus Cylinder back.jpg|250px|thumb|The [[Cyrus Cylinder]] is a proclamation of [[Cyrus the Great]], who ruled much of the Middle East.  Its advocacy of religious freedom has been claimed as the first declaration of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Cyrus Cylinder and Ancient Persia: A New Beginning for the Middle East |first1=John |last1=Curtis |first2=Neil |last2=MacGregor |publisher=British Museum |year=2013 |isbn=9780714111872 |quote=It is often referred to as the first bill of human rights as it appears to permit freedom of worship throughout the Persian Empire and to allow deported people to return to their homelands.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Human rights in the Middle East''' have been shaped by the legal and political development of international [[human rights]] law after the [[World War II|Second World War]], and their application to the [[Middle East]]. The 2004 [[United Nations]] Arab Human Development Report&lt;ref name="undp.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.undp.org/oslocentre/docs05/update_april%202005.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614102233/http://www.undp.org/oslocentre/docs05/Update_april%202005.pdf |archive-date=2007-06-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (AHDR) claims that although Arab-Islamic tradition does hold unique importance for ideas of human welfare, history has proven that "they were not sufficiently prevalent in society to foster a culture based on a political contract, and allow for the legitimacy of differences of opinion, dialogue and transfer of power."&lt;ref name="undp.org"/&gt;
Issues of the validity of democracy in the region and human rights are at the very centre of the challenges facing Middle Eastern society today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-ir.info/2011/03/30/human-rights-in-the-middle-east-questions-of-compatibility-and-conflict/|title=Human Rights In The Middle East: Questions Of Compatibility And Conflict|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal framework ==

=== International Obligations ===
In 1948 [[Egypt]], [[Iran]] and [[Pakistan]] signed the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR). Saudi Arabia did not, arguing that it "failed to take into consideration the cultural and religious context of non-Western countries."&lt;ref name="lse.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mec/2012/12/10/1569/?replytocom=49098|title=Human Rights: The Universal Declaration vs The Cairo Declaration|date=10 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam]] was adopted by 45 member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in August 1990. This declaration undermines many of the rights the UDHR guarantees allowing all the member states to abide by a set of human rights based on Shari'a law.&lt;ref name="lse.ac.uk"/&gt; For example, Article 18 of the UDHR establishes that everyone has the "right to freedom of religion, freedom to change his religion and freedom to manifest his religion in teaching, practice, worship and observance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf|title=Declaration |website=ohchr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 10 of the CDHRI establishes that "It is prohibited to exercise any form of compulsion on man or to exploit his poverty or ignorance in order to convert him to another religion or to atheism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oic-oci.org/english/article/human.htm|title=Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014100154/http://www.oic-oci.org/english/article/human.htm|archive-date=2006-10-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab Human Rights Committee,&lt;ref name="fidh.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fidh.org/en/international-advocacy/other-regional-organisations/league-of-arab-states/Human-Rights-organizations-and|title=Human Rights organizations and Arab Human Rights Committee engage in constructive dialogue|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established in 2009 to oversee compliance with the [[Arab Charter on Human Rights]], which entered into force in March 2017. As of the beginning of October 2009, ten Arab states ratified the Arab Charter on Human Rights. These are: [[Algeria]], [[Bahrain]], [[Jordan]], [[Libya]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Syria]], [[United Arab Emirates]], and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="fidh.org"/&gt;  As of February 2012, another four States ratified the Arab Charter. These were: [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Sudan]], and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="ijrcenter.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijrcenter.org/regional/middle-east-and-north-africa/|title=Middle East and North Africa|date=8 April 2010|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Charter creates a process through which the Committee receives and reviews state reports and makes recommendations as appropriate. The Charter does not provide for a complaints mechanism.&lt;ref name="ijrcenter.org"/&gt;

The Committee has had three sessions during which it has been focusing on "procedural aspects of organising its work".&lt;ref name="fidh.org"/&gt;

== Human rights issues ==

=== Capital punishment ===
In regards to [[capital punishment]] the countries of the region can be separated into two categories: 
# [[Tunisia]], Algeria, [[Morocco]], [[Israel]] and [[Mauritania]] are considered 'abolitionist in practice'. Aside from Israel, all of the above countries maintain the death penalty for serious crimes such as drug-related offences and murder, however no executions have been carried out in a long time. The last Israeli execution was carried out in 1962 as they have retained capital punishment not for ordinary crimes but purely exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/briefing_note/join/2012/491450/EXPO-JOIN_SP(2012)491450_EN.pdf |title=Policy declaration |website=europarl.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# All other countries in the Middle East execute prisoners for crimes including ‘ordinary crimes’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/death-penalty/|title=Death Penalty|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the de facto autonomous [[Rojava]] federation in Syria, formed during the [[Syrian Civil War]], capital punishment has been abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biehlonbookchin.com/justice-system-in-rojava/|title=The New Justice System in Rojava|publisher=biehlonbookchin.com|date=2014-10-13|accessdate=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The death penalty has proven difficult to eradicate in the Middle East due largely to many countries’ legal systems being based around religion, which is more “resistant to change than systems based solely on legislation”.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"/&gt;  In most countries in the Middle Eastern region, the legal system is largely based primarily on [[Shari'a]]. However, Israel's legal system has different sources.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"/&gt;
In criminal law determined by Shari'a, most crimes classified as [[Hudud]] are punishable by death and are considered dangerous for Islamic society. Their punishments are fixed in the [[Qu´ran]] and the [[Hadith]]. They include [[adultery]], [[apostasy]], [[armed robbery]] and [[rebellion]].
In 2012, Iran cemented its lead position in the region with two executions per day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT%20TA%2020121122%20ITEMS%20DOC%20XML%20V0//EN&amp;language=EN#sdocta18|title=Texts adopted - Thursday, 22 November 2012|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Iran continues to execute juvenile prisoners despite its international obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/08/29/iran-proposed-penal-code-deeply-flawed|title=Iran: Proposed Penal Code Deeply Flawed|date=29 August 2012|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to studies undertaken by Amnesty International in 2015, at least 1,196 executions were carried out in eight Middle Eastern countries – “a rise of 26% from the 945 executions recorded in eight countries in 2014”.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/04/death-penalty-2015-facts-and-figures/|title=Death penalty 2015: Facts and figures|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Iran alone accounted for 82% of all recorded executions in the region&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt; and Saudi Arabia executed at least 158 people – a 76% increase on 2014 and the highest number recorded for Saudi Arabia since 1995”.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt;

Capital punishment represents the most dramatic clash between a ‘UN-sponsored’ human rights concept and Shari'a law.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"/&gt;  Shari'a establishes the death penalty as mandatory punishment for a number of Hudud crimes. “Moreover, some execution methods envisaged in the holy texts, such as [[flogging]], [[stoning]] and [[amputation]], violate international conventions that prohibit torture and cruel and inhuman treatments.”&lt;ref name="europa.eu"/&gt;
The [[Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcoalition.org/Second-Optional-Protocol-Frequently-Asked-Questions.html|title=World Coalition Against Death Penalty|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at abolishing the death penalty, was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1989. Article 1 of the Protocol states that all the Protocol's Parties shall refrain from carrying out executions and shall take all necessary measures to abolish the death penalty within their jurisdiction. None of the countries in the Middle Eastern region have ratified this protocol, although most have signed and ratified the ICCPR.

=== Freedom of religion ===
{{main|Freedom of religion in the Middle East|Irreligion in the Middle East}}
In Egypt, the Constitutional Declaration of March 2011 and the new constitution ratified on December 22, 2011 provide for some freedom of religion, but certain constitutional provisions, laws, and government policies and practices limit that freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2012religiousfreedom/index.htm?dlid=208388&amp;year=2012#wrapper|title=International Religious Freedom Report for 2012|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Saudi Arabia, freedom of religion is not recognised nor protected under the law. [[Sunni Islam]] is the official religion according to the 1992 Basic Law and the Qur'an and the Sunna are Saudi Arabia’s constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/us-report-religious-freedom-middle-east#sthash.OG3s3eLL.dpuf|title=U.S. Report on Religious Freedom in Middle East|date=20 May 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuwait’s Constitution allows for religious freedom however this is not often put into practice. The government generally enforces the restrictions on freedom of religion established by other laws and policies. Sharia (Islamic law) is the core source of legislation and Islam is the state religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fciv.org/downloads/Joseph_Ellul_FREEDOM%20OF%20RELIGION%20IN%20THE%20MIDDLE%20EASTERN%20CONTEXT.pdf|title=Declaration of religious freedom |website=fciv.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Iraq and Lebanon's governments generally respect religious freedom. It is protected in the constitution and various other laws.  In Lebanon “The constitution declares equality of rights and duties for all citizens without discrimination or preference but establishes a balance of power among the major religious groups.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/208612.pdf |title=Report |website=state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Iraq Islam is considered the official religion. The constitution instructs that Islam be considered the main source of legislation, and declares that no law may be enacted that contradicts the “established provisions of Islam.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/222503.pdf |title=Report |website=state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Rojava]], the ''[[de facto]]'' autonomous [[Rojava|Federation of Northern Syria – Rojava]] in [[Syria]] formed during the [[Syrian Civil War]], guarantees freedom of religion.

=== Status of women ===
{{further|Women in Arab societies}}

==== Employment ====
Women throughout the Middle East earn less than men although there are [[labour laws]] in place that dictate equal opportunities for promotion and training and [[equal pay]] for the same type of work. These labour laws are frequently violated in regards to not only salary but also benefits such as loans for senior officials or housing allowances.&lt;ref name="freedomhouse.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/Women's%20Rights%20in%20the%20Middle%20East%20and%20Noth%20Africa,%20Gulf%20Edition.pdf |title=Women's rights |website=freedomhouse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in most countries throughout the Middle East can file complaints of discrimination with government agencies but these are often ineffective due to their inability to effectively investigate discrimination cases or impose penalties for employers who violate the labour laws.&lt;ref name="freedomhouse.org"/&gt;

In many countries in the region, labour laws prohibit women from undertaking arduous or dangerous work, or work which could be deemed “detrimental to their health or morals”.&lt;ref name="freedomhouse.org"/&gt; Women are prohibited from working at night, with the exception of those employed in medicine and a few other fields. Although these provisions are seen locally as a means of protecting women, in effect they “treat women as minors who are unable to make decisions regarding their own safety and hold women’s guardians responsible if the rules are violated.”.&lt;ref name="freedomhouse.org"/&gt;

==== Education ====
{{further|Education in the Middle East and North Africa}}
Education has been an important area of advancement for women in the region, and is a significant path for their advancement toward wider equality. Since the 1990s, women in the region have made advances in access to literacy, education, university enrolment, and the range of subjects of study available to them.&lt;ref name="freedomhouse.org"/&gt; In Saudi Arabia, for example, three educational institutions started to permit women to study law in 2007. However, they remain prohibited from serving as lawyers and judges in court and are only allowed to act as legal consultants to other women.&lt;ref name="freedomhouse.org"/&gt;
Despite these improvements, there are still many barriers to gender equality in education. In majority countries studied, universities largely remain segregated by gender.&lt;ref name="freedomhouse.org"/&gt; In Saudi Arabia, for example, the number and diversity of classes offered to men are much greater than those available to women.&lt;ref name="freedomhouse.org"/&gt;

==== Domestic Abuse ====
No country in the region (with the sole exception of the defactor autonomous [[Human Rights in Rojava|Rojava]] federation in Syria) offers specific protections against [[spousal rape]] or [[domestic violence]] however physical abuse is generally prohibited.&lt;ref name="freedomhouse.org"/&gt; There is a lack of official protection of rights within the home and a lack of government accountability in these regions. It is believed that most domestic violence is typically covered up and kept within the family as many women in the region feel they cannot discuss their abuse without damaging their own and their family’s [[reputation]] and honour.&lt;ref name="freedomhouse.org"/&gt;
Abused women rarely attempt to file complaints with police and when they do they frequently encounter officers who are “reluctant to get involved in what is perceived as a family matter and who encourage reconciliation rather than legal action. In Saudi Arabia in particular, guardianship laws make it very difficult for battered wives to find a safe haven.”.&lt;ref name="freedomhouse.org"/&gt;

=== Children's rights ===
All the states in the Middle East region have ratified the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC). Following the ratification of the CRC, Middle Eastern countries have enacted or proposed to enact laws to protect children from violence, abuse, neglect or exploitation. A number of countries have put in place comprehensive Child Laws that bring together legal provisions for the protection of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://resourcecentre.savethechildren.se/sites/default/files/documents/1949.pdf |title=Children's rights|website=resourcecentre.savethechildren.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt, pre 2011 revolution, had been making progress in education, access to vaccines and sanitized water for children. Child labour, violence against girls, gender gaps within education and socioeconomic conditions had continued to be identified as areas of concern. Today, child arrests, detention and imprisonment continue to be a protection risk for children in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defenceforchildren.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ChildRightsMENA_Final_Report.pdf |title=Children's rights|website=defenceforchildren.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of 2013, UNICEF estimated that 400 children wound up arrested in connection with political turmoil.&lt;ref name="unicef.org.nz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org.nz/syria-five-years-content/global-update|title=Global Update - UNICEF NZ|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 2000, the Egyptian Foundation for Advancement of Childhood Conditions (EFACC),  advocates against children’s abuse and exploitation, advances protections for those in conflict with the law and promotes children’s welfare. EFACC also provides free legal aid to children in trouble.
Both external and internal conflict, ongoing political instability and the Syrian refugee crisis remain grave dangers for children in Iraq. The escalating armed conflict with the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) has placed more children in peril. Multiple aspects of children’s lives are at high risk especially [[child labour]], education, shelter, sexual violence and child recruitment. .&lt;ref name="unicef.org.nz"/&gt; Founded in 2005, South Youth Organization (SYO) raises awareness of human rights and works to achieve greater protections for them. SYO exposes and documents grave violations against children, focusing specifically on [[discrimination]] issues, [[sectarian violence]] and abuse of women and girls. .&lt;ref name="unicef.org.nz"/&gt;

==Regional Human Rights Initiatives==
Several cross-regional programmes and initiatives are supporting Human Rights today, including:
* The '''Arab Network for National Human Rights Institutions''' groups together 14 National Human Rights Institutions from across the Arab World:  Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Sudan, and Tunisia. 
* The '''Arab Institute for Human Rights''' is an independent Arab non-governmental organisation based in Tunisia. It was founded in 1989 at the initiative of the Arab Organisation for Human Rights, the Arab Lawyers Union, and the Tunisian League for Human Rights and with the support of the United Nations Centre for Human Rights.
* The [[Arab Commission for Human Rights]] (unrelated to the inter-governmental [[Arab Commission on Human Rights]]&lt;ref name="oxford_HRLawReview" /&gt;) was created in 1998 by 15 human rights activists, including [[Haytham Manna]] from Syria, [[Moncef Marzouki]] from Tunisia, and others from Egypt and other Arab world countries.&lt;ref name="Emory_Law" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ACHR_about" /&gt;
* The '''Coalition of Arab Cities against Racism, Discrimination, Xenophobia and Intolerance''' was launched in 2008, in Casablanca, Morocco. It is part of the International Coalition of Inclusive and Sustainable Cities (ICCAR), an initiative launched by UNESCO in March 2004. These regional coalitions seek to establish a network of cities interested in sharing experiences in order to improve their policies to fight racism, discrimination, xenophobia and exclusion.
* The [[Arabic Network for Human Rights Information]], an NGO based in Egypt that collects publications, campaigns, reports, and statements from almost 140 Arabic human rights organizations across the region and republishes them in a daily digest. 
* The [[Arab Master's in Democracy and Human Rights]] was created in 2015 with the support of the European Union. It groups together several universities from across the Arab Region (Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Morocco, and Tunisia) in joint activities, including a specialised master's programme with theoretical, practical and critical features.

'''ISO 12620''' is a [[Technical standard|standard]] from [[ISO/TC 37]] which defines a ''Data Category Registry'', a registry for registering linguistic terms used in various fields of [[Machine translation|translation]], [[computational linguistics]] and [[natural language processing]] and defining mappings both between different terms and the same terms used in different systems.

The goal of the registry is that new systems can reuse existing terminology, or at least be easily mapped to existing terminology, to aid [[interoperability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.136.4771 |title= Terminology for Translators -- an Implementation of ISO 12620 |first= Robert |last= Bononno |work=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu |year=2011 |accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end a number of terminologies have been added to the registry, including ones based on the [[GOLD (ontology)|General Ontology for Linguistic Description]], the [[National Corpus of Polish]] and the TermBase eXchange from the [[Localization Industry Standards Association]].

The standard was first released as '''ISO 12620:1999'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=2517 |title=ISO 12620:1999 - Computer applications in terminology -- Data categories |work=iso.org |year=2011 |accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was rendered obsolete by '''ISO 12620:2009'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=37243 |title=ISO 12620:2009 - Terminology and other language and content resources -- Specification of data categories and management of a Data Category Registry for language resources |work=iso.org |year=2011 |accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition was [[English language|English]]-only, the second bilingual English-[[French language|French]].

The standard is relatively low-level but is used by other standards such as [[Lexical Markup Framework]] ('''ISO 24613:2008''').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9940">'''Informal Education''' is a general term for education that can occur outside of a structured curriculum.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Informal Education encompasses student interests within a curriculum in a regular classroom, but is not limited to that setting.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogoff|first=Barbara|last2=Callanan|first2=Maureen|last3=Gutiérrez|first3=Kris|last4=Erickson|first4=Frederick|date=March 2016|title=The Organization of Informal Learning|url=|journal=Review of Research in Education|volume=40|pages=356 –401|doi=10.3102/0091732x16680994}}&lt;/ref&gt; It works through conversation, and the exploration and enlargement of experience. Sometimes there is a clear objective link to some broader plan, but not always. The goal is to provide learners with the tools he or she needs to eventually reach more complex material.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cultural Nature of Human Development|last=Rogoff|first=Barbara|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780199813629|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can refer to various forms of [[alternative education]], such as: [[Unschooling]] or [[homeschooling]], [[Autodidacticism]] (Self-teaching), [[Youth work]], and [[Informal learning]]

Informal Education consists of accidental and purposeful ways of collaborating on new information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It can be discussion based and focuses on bridging the gaps between traditional classroom settings and life outside of the classroom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Role of Informal Education ==
People interpret information differently, and therefore a structured curriculum may not allow all learners to understand the information. Informal education is less controlled than the average classroom setting, which is why informal education can be so powerful.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callanan|first=Maureen|last2=Cervantes|first2=Christi|last3=Loomis|first3=Molly|date=2011|title=Informal Learning|url=|journal=WIREs Cognitive Science|volume=2|pages=646–655|doi=10.1002/wcs.143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informal education can help individuals learn to react to and control different situations and settings. In addition, it combines social entities that are important for learning. Informal Education may be viewed as the learning that comes as a part of being involved in youth and community organizations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This type of education is a spontaneous process, which helps people to learn information in a new way. It helps to cultivate communities, associations and relationships that make for a positive learning environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Characteristics of Informal Education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=John|last2=Collins|first2=Alan|last3=Duguid|first3=Paul|date=1989|title=Situated Cognition and The Culture of Learning|jstor=1176008|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=18|pages=32–42|doi=10.2307/1176008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==

# Informal Education looks to create or deepen situations where people can learn, explore and enlarge experiences, and make changes.
# Provides an environment where everyone can learn together and can scaffold off of one another.
# Understanding that the activity can be based on any form of learning, the teaching does not have to be deliberate, more so implied.  We give students the tools to do complex materials over time, rather than teaching the complex material and then giving the tools.
# Focuses on the social aspects of learning, and how important collaborative learning is.
# The tools students are given are tangible for the processes in which they will be applied.
#Bridges the gap between school and life.
# Allows students a choice in learning, and how to approach the material.
# Make learning accessible in every day life and in the future.
# Informal Education is driven by conversation and interacting with others.

== Informal Education offers the following ==

# Responsiveness when interacting with the environment.
# Possibility to act freely in unknown situations.
# Possibility for an individual to learn without any obligations or restrictions.
# Allows for free choice and changes in interests.
# Ability to create ones own identity.

== Informal Education tends to emphasize certain values it includes ==
# Work for the well being of all.
# Respect the unique value and dignity of each human being.
# Dialogue.
# Equality and justice.
# Democracy and the active involvement of people in the issues that affect their life. (Jeff and Smith 2005:95-6)

Informal Education focuses on values. There is no curriculum or guiding plan for a lot of work.

== Informal Education in Indigenous African Communities ==
Informal education has been the practice of indigenous communities in Africa as long as people have lived there. The tradition of African education has long been closely intertwined with the daily life of the African people with the idea that children "learnt what they lived".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sitwe.wordpress.com/2011/10/30/indigenous-african-education/|title=INDIGENOUS AFRICAN EDUCATION|date=2011-10-30|work=sitwe|access-date=2018-05-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy of traditional African education suggests that one’s education cannot be separated from the everyday life and the “curriculum” is thus considered “a way of life” with the ultimate goal being to create a "complete individual, [and] a lifelong learner".&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Omolewa|first=Michael|date=2007|title=Traditional African Modes of Education: Their Relevance in the Modern World|jstor=27715419|journal=International Review of Education / Internationale Zeitschrift für Erziehungswissenschaft / Revue Internationale de l'Education|volume=53|issue=5/6|pages=593–612}}&lt;/ref&gt; The knowledge and practices that are important to the community are generally passed down through the sharing of memories and participation in cultural activities. Their education system serves as “the information base for the community, which facilitates communication and decision-making”.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Similar to other indigenous communities such as the Chillihuani in Peru, African education is created with goals in mind but is not limited to typical classroom settings; students continually participate in various learning activities as they grow in the community.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The culture within traditional African communities contain methods of learning. Through song and dance children learn more about their language as well as how to read and write. Oral traditions are used to teach children about history and morals as well as other forms of culture and practical skills for survival. In northern Tanzania and southern Kenya, the children of the Maasai pastoralists learn skills such as "where to find water and green shrubs that can be fed to young calves" in case of drought.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Children are encouraged to show respect to their elders and through this, children learn how to show respect though their actions and words. A child can even learn the circumstances of their birth through their names. ''Onipede,'' a Yoruba name in Nigeria, suggests that the child was born soon after the death of a family member.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Through their traditional science, children learn how to contribute to health and food production. everything that is a part of their life is used as a means to learn about themselves, their communities, and their culture.

== Advantages ==

If a person masters a skill by becoming deeply engaged in solving a problem, then giving students real world issues or opportunities to solve problems in their own lives and communities would significantly motivate and help them to master new concepts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Teaching students new scientific concepts by using cultural tools could eliminate the time spent trying to figure out whether concepts are useful or not. This may motivate learners and help them to master what we teach from the start. If we applied english and grammar lessons to effectively communicate with others in the community, students would be more inclined to effectively master these concepts since they would be using them for individual or group purposes. Finally, formal schooling, unlike an informal school setting, discourages students from learning and problem solving on their own.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Interlingua''' ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|n|t|ər|ˈ|l|ɪ|ŋ|ɡ|w|ə}}; [[ISO 639]] language codes ''ia'', ''ina'') is an [[Italic languages|Italic]] [[international auxiliary language]] (IAL), developed between 1937 and 1951 by the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] (IALA). It ranks among the top most widely used IALs (along with [[Esperanto]] and [[Ido (language)|Ido]]), and is the most widely used [[International auxiliary language#Classification|naturalistic]] IAL:&lt;ref name="gopsill1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gopsill|first=F. P.|title=International languages: a matter for Interlingua|year=1990|publisher=British Interlingua Society|location=[[Sheffield]], [[England]]|isbn=0-9511695-6-4|oclc=27813762}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other words, its vocabulary, grammar and other characteristics are derived from natural languages, rather than being centrally planned. Interlingua was developed to combine a simple, mostly regular grammar&lt;ref&gt;See Gopsill, F. P. ''Interlingua: A course for beginners.'' Part 1. Sheffield, England: British Interlingua Society, 1987. Gopsill, here and elsewhere, characterizes Interlingua as having a simple grammar and no irregularities.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Interlingua: A Grammar of the International Language|Interlingua Grammar]] suggests that Interlingua has a small number of irregularities. See Gode (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; with a vocabulary common to the widest possible range of western European languages,&lt;ref name="iala1971"&gt;Gode, Alexander, "Introduction", [https://web.archive.org/web/20071227051537/http://www.bowks.net/worldlang/aux/b_IED.html ''Interlingua-English: A dictionary of the international language''], Revised Edition, New York: Continuum International Publishing Group, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; making it unusually easy to learn, at least for those whose native languages were sources of Interlingua's [[vocabulary]] and grammar.&lt;ref name="breinstrup-beginners"&gt;Breinstrup, Thomas, Preface, [http://www.interlingua.com/archivos/Prefacio%20-%20Contento.pdf ''Interlingua course for beginners''], Bilthoven, Netherlands: Union Mundial pro Interlingua, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, it is used as a rapid introduction to many natural languages.&lt;ref name="gopsill1990"/&gt;

Interlingua literature maintains that (written) Interlingua is comprehensible to the hundreds of millions of people who speak [[Romance languages]],&lt;ref&gt;Yeager, Leland B., "Le linguistica como reclamo pro Interlingua" (Linguistics as an advertisement for Interlingua), ''Interlinguistica e Interlingua: Discursos public'', Beekbergen, Netherlands: Servicio de Libros UMI, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; though it is actively spoken by only a few hundred.&lt;ref name="Fiedler"/&gt;

The name Interlingua comes from the Latin words ''{{wiktla|inter}}'', meaning "between", and ''{{wiktla|lingua}}'', meaning "tongue" or "language". These [[morpheme]]s are identical in Interlingua. Thus, "Interlingua" would mean "between language".

== Rationale ==
The expansive movements of science, technology, trade, diplomacy, and the arts, combined with the historical dominance of the [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]] languages have resulted in a large common vocabulary among European languages. With Interlingua, an objective procedure is used to extract and standardize the most widespread word or words for a concept found in a set of ''control languages'': [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], with [[German language|German]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] as secondary references. Words from any language are eligible for inclusion, so long as their internationality is shown by their presence in these control languages. Hence, Interlingua includes such diverse word forms as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''geisha'' and ''samurai'', [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''califa'', [[Guugu Yimithirr language|Guugu Yimithirr]] ''gangurru'' (Interlingua: kanguru), and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''sauna''.&lt;ref name="iala1971"/&gt;

Interlingua combines this pre-existing vocabulary with a minimal grammar based on the control languages. People with a good knowledge of a Romance language, or a smattering of a Romance language plus a good knowledge of the ''[[international scientific vocabulary]]'' can frequently understand it immediately on reading or hearing it. The immediate comprehension of Interlingua, in turn, makes it unusually easy to learn. Speakers of [[language|other languages]] can also learn to speak and write Interlingua in a short time, thanks to its simple grammar and regular word formation using a small number of [[root (linguistics)|roots]] and [[affix]]es.&lt;ref name="many-represented"&gt;[[Alice Vanderbilt Morris|Morris, Alice Vanderbilt]], ''[http://www.interlingua.fi/ialagr45.htm#manyrepresented General Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040702192153/http://www.interlingua.fi/ialagr45.htm |date=2004-07-02 }}'', New York: International Auxiliary Language Association, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once learned, Interlingua can be used to learn other related languages quickly and easily, and in some studies, even to understand them immediately. Research with [[Swedish language|Swedish]] students has shown that, after learning Interlingua, they can translate elementary texts from Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. In one 1974 study, an Interlingua class translated a Spanish text that students who had taken 150 hours of Spanish found too difficult to understand.&lt;ref name="gopsill1990"/&gt; Gopsill has suggested that Interlingua's freedom from irregularities allowed the students to grasp the mechanisms of language quickly.&lt;ref name="gopsill1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="many-represented"/&gt;

Words in Interlingua retain their original form from the source language; they are altered as little as possible to fit Interlingua's [[phonotactics]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Each word retains its original spelling, pronunciation, and meanings. For this reason, Interlingua is frequently termed a ''naturalistic'' IAL.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

When compared to natural languages, Interlingua most resembles [[Spanish language|Spanish]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}{{according to whom|date=April 2017}}

{{Main|History of Interlingua}}

&lt;!--[[Image:Interlinguadeiala-tenue&amp;latin.jpg|thumb|One of the many unofficial logo designs created for Interlingua, displaying the main logo with a "control language" flag montage below.{{Deletable image-caption|Monday, 30 August 2010|date=May 2012}}]]--&gt;
The American heiress [[Alice Vanderbilt Morris]] (1874–1950) became interested in [[linguistics]] and the [[international auxiliary language]] movement in the early 1920s, and in 1924, Morris and her husband, [[Dave Hennen Morris]], established the non-profit International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) in [[New York City]]. Their aim was to place the study of IALs on a scientific basis. Morris developed the research program of IALA in consultation with [[Edward Sapir]], [[William Edward Collinson]], and [[Otto Jespersen]].&lt;ref&gt;Falk, Julia S. "Words without grammar: Linguists and the international language movement in the United States, ''Language and Communication'', 15(3): pp. 241–259. Pergamon, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Auxiliary Language Association ===
The IALA became a major supporter of mainstream American linguistics, funding, for example, numerous studies by Sapir, Collinson, and [[Morris Swadesh]] in the 1930s and 1940s. Alice Morris edited several of these studies and provided much of IALA's financial support.&lt;ref name="iala1971_foreword"&gt;Bray, Mary Connell [1951] (1971), "Foreword", [https://web.archive.org/web/20071006090121/http://www.bowks.net/worldlang/aux/b_IED-foreword.html ''Interlingua-English: A dictionary of the international Language''], Second Edition, New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Company. {{ISBN|0-8044-0188-8}}. {{OCLC|162319}}. Retrieved on 2010-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt; IALA also received support from such prestigious groups as the [[Carnegie Corporation]], the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Research Corporation]], and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].&lt;ref name="gopsill-historia"&gt;Gopsill, F. P., and Sexton, Brian, [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/historia-1.htm "Le historia antenatal de interlingua"], ''Historia de interlingua'', 2001, revised 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its early years, IALA concerned itself with three tasks: finding other organizations around the world with similar goals; building a library of books about [[language]]s and [[interlinguistics]]; and comparing extant IALs, including [[Esperanto]], [[Esperanto II]], [[Ido (language)|Ido]], [[Latino sine flexione|Peano’s Interlingua]] (Latino sine flexione), [[Novial]], and [[Occidental language|Interlingue]] (Occidental). In pursuit of the last goal, it conducted parallel studies of these languages, with comparative studies of national languages, under the direction of scholars at American and European universities.&lt;ref name="iala1971_foreword"/&gt; It also arranged conferences with proponents of these IALs, who debated features and goals of their respective languages. With a "concession rule" that required participants to make a certain number of concessions, early debates at IALA sometimes grew from heated to explosive.&lt;ref name="gopsill1990"/&gt;

At the Second International Interlanguage Congress, held in [[Geneva]] in 1931, IALA began to break new ground; 27 recognized linguists signed a testimonial of support for IALA's research program. An additional eight added their signatures at the third congress, convened in [[Rome]] in 1933.&lt;ref name="gopsill1990"/&gt; That same year, [[Herbert N. Shenton]] and [[Edward L. Thorndike]] became influential in IALA's work by authoring key studies in the interlinguistic field.&lt;ref name="iala1971_foreword"/&gt;

The first steps towards the finalization of Interlingua were taken in 1937, when a committee of 24 eminent linguists from 19 universities published ''Some Criteria for an International Language and Commentary''. However, the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939 cut short the intended biannual meetings of the committee.&lt;ref name="gopsill1990"/&gt;

===Development of a new language===
Originally, the association had not set out to create its own language. Its goal was to identify which auxiliary language already available was best suited for international communication, and how to promote it most effectively. However, after ten years of research, more and more members of IALA concluded that none of the existing [[interlanguage]]s were up to the task. By 1937, the members had made the decision to create a new language, to the surprise of the world's interlanguage community.&lt;ref name="gopsill-historia2"&gt;Gopsill, F. P., and Sexton, Brian, [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/historia-2.htm "Profunde recerca duce a un lingua"], ''Historia de interlingua'', 2001, revised 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

To that point, much of the debate had been equivocal on the decision to use naturalistic (e.g., [[Latino sine flexione|Peano’s Interlingua]], [[Novial]] and [[Occidental language|Occidental]]) or systematic (e.g., [[Esperanto]] and [[Ido (language)|Ido]]) words. During the war years, proponents of a naturalistic interlanguage won out. The first support was Thorndike's paper; the second was a concession by proponents of the systematic languages that thousands of words were already present in many, or even a majority, of the European languages. Their argument was that systematic derivation of words was a [[Procrustes|Procrustean bed]], forcing the learner to unlearn and re-memorize a new derivation scheme when a usable vocabulary was already available. This finally convinced supporters of the systematic languages, and IALA from that point assumed the position that a naturalistic language would be best.&lt;ref name="gopsill1990"/&gt;

At the outbreak of [[World War II]], IALA's research activities were moved from Liverpool to New York, where [[Ezra Clark Stillman|E. Clark Stillman]] established a new research staff.&lt;ref name="iala1971_foreword"/&gt; Stillman, with the assistance of [[Alexander Gode]], developed a ''prototyping'' technique – an objective methodology for selecting and standardizing vocabulary based on a comparison of ''control languages''.&lt;ref name="gopsill1990"/&gt;

In 1943 Stillman left for war work and Gode became Acting Director of Research.&lt;ref name="iala1971_foreword"/&gt; IALA began to develop models of the proposed language, the first of which were presented in Morris's ''General Report'' in 1945.&lt;ref name="gopsill-historia2"/&gt;

From 1946 to 1948, French linguist [[André Martinet]] was Director of Research. During this period IALA continued to develop models and conducted polling to determine the optimal form of the final language. In 1946, IALA sent an extensive survey to more than 3,000 language teachers and related professionals on three continents.&lt;ref name="gopsill1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gopsill-historia3"&gt;Gopsill, F. P., and Sexton, Brian, [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/historia-3.htm "Le natura, si – un schema, no"], ''Historia de interlingua'', 2001, revised 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four models were canvassed:&lt;ref name="gopsill1990"/&gt;

{| border=0
|- valign=top
| &amp;nbsp; || Model&amp;nbsp;P || &amp;nbsp; || highly&amp;nbsp;naturalistic, with word forms unchanged from the prototypes
|- valign=top
| &amp;nbsp; || Model&amp;nbsp;M || &amp;nbsp; || moderately&amp;nbsp;naturalistic, similar to Occidental
|- valign=top
| &amp;nbsp; || Model&amp;nbsp;C || &amp;nbsp; || slightly&amp;nbsp;schematic, along the lines of Novial
|- valign=top
| &amp;nbsp; || Model&amp;nbsp;K || &amp;nbsp; || moderately&amp;nbsp;schematic, similar to Ido (less schematic than Esperanto)
|}

The results of the survey were striking. The two more schematic models were rejected – K overwhelmingly. Of the two naturalistic models, M received somewhat more support than P. IALA decided on a compromise between P and M, with certain elements of C.&lt;ref name="gopsill-historia3"/&gt;

Martinet took up a position at [[Columbia University]] in 1948, and Gode took on the last phase of Interlingua's development.&lt;ref name="iala1971_foreword"/&gt; The vocabulary and grammar of Interlingua were first presented in 1951, when IALA published the finalized ''[[Interlingua: A Grammar of the International Language|Interlingua Grammar]]'' and the 27,000-word ''[[Interlingua-English Dictionary|Interlingua–English Dictionary]]'' (IED). In 1954, IALA  published an introductory manual entitled ''[[Interlingua a Prime Vista]]'' ("Interlingua at First Sight").

Interlingua as presented by the IALA is very close to [[Latino sine flexione|Peano’s Interlingua]] (Latino sine flexione), both in its grammar and especially in its vocabulary. Accordingly, the very name "Interlingua" was kept, yet a distinct abbreviation was adopted: IA instead of IL.

===Success, decline, and resurgence===
An early practical application of Interlingua was the scientific newsletter ''Spectroscopia Molecular'', published from 1952 to 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Breinstrup, Thomas, [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/publicationes/spectroscopia.htm "Un revolution in le mundo scientific" (A revolution in the scientific world).] Accessed January 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, Interlingua was used at the Second World Cardiological Congress in [[Washington, D.C.]] for both written summaries and oral interpretation. Within a few years, it found similar use at nine further medical congresses. Between the mid-1950s and the late 1970s, some thirty scientific and especially medical journals provided article summaries in Interlingua. [[Society for Science and the Public|Science Service]], the publisher of ''Science Newsletter'' at the time, published a monthly column in Interlingua from the early 1950s until Gode's death in 1970. In 1967, the [[International Organization for Standardization]], which normalizes terminology, voted almost unanimously to adopt Interlingua as the basis for its dictionaries.&lt;ref name="gopsill1990"/&gt;

The [[International Auxiliary Language Association|IALA]] closed its doors in 1953 but was not formally dissolved until 1956 or later.&lt;ref name = "esterhill2000"/&gt; Its role in promoting Interlingua was largely taken on by Science Service,&lt;ref name="gopsill-historia3"/&gt; which hired Gode as head of its newly formed [[Interlingua Division of Science Service|Interlingua Division]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/biographias/gode.htm Biographias: Alexander Gottfried Friedrich Gode-von Aesch]. Accessed January 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugh E. Blair]], Gode's close friend and colleague, became his assistant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/biographias/blair.htm Biographias: Hugh Edward Blair.] Accessed January 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A successor organization, the Interlingua Institute,&lt;ref name="portrait-organizations"&gt;[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/organisationes.htm Portrait del organisationes de interlingua.] Access January 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1970 to promote Interlingua in the US and Canada. The new institute supported the work of other linguistic organizations, made considerable scholarly contributions and produced Interlingua summaries for scholarly and medical publications. One of its largest achievements was two immense volumes on phytopathology produced by the American Phytopathological Society in 1976 and 1977.&lt;ref name="esterhill2000"&gt;Esterhill, Frank, ''Interlingua Institute: A History''. New York: Interlingua Institute, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interlingua had attracted many former adherents of other international-language projects, notably [[Occidental language|Occidental]] and Ido. The former Occidentalist [[Richard Berger|Ric Berger]] founded The [[Union Mundial pro Interlingua]] ([[Union Mundial pro Interlingua|UMI]]) in 1955,&lt;ref name="portrait-organizations"/&gt; and by the late 1950s, interest in Interlingua in Europe had already begun to overtake that in North America.

Beginning in the 1980s, UMI has held international conferences every two years (typical attendance at the earlier meetings was 50 to 100) and launched a publishing programme that eventually produced over 100 volumes. Other Interlingua-language works were published by university presses in [[Sweden]] and [[Italy]], and in the 1990s, [[Brazil]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interlingua.com/libros/pt.htm Bibliographia de Interlingua.] Accessed January 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/biographias/stenstrom.htm Biographias: Ingvar Stenström.] Accessed January 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Scandinavia]]n schools undertook projects that used Interlingua as a means of teaching the international scientific and intellectual vocabulary.&lt;ref name = "breinstrup-futur"/&gt;

In 2000, the Interlingua Institute was dissolved amid funding disputes with the UMI; the American Interlingua Society, established the following year, succeeded the institute and responded to new interest emerging in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="portrait-organizations"/&gt;

===In the Soviet bloc===
Interlingua was spoken and promoted in the [[Soviet bloc]], despite attempts to suppress the language. In the [[German Democratic Republic]], government officials confiscated the letters and magazines that the UMI sent to Walter Rädler, the Interlingua representative there.&lt;ref&gt;"Interlingua usate in le posta". [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/stampaspostal.htm Historia de Interlingua], 2001, revised 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Július Tomin (Interlingua)|Július Tomin]] published his first article on Interlingua in the Slovak magazine ''Príroda a spoločnosť'' (Nature and Society) in 1971, after which he received several anonymous threatening letters.&lt;ref&gt;Breinstrup, Thomas. "Persecutate pro parlar Interlingua." ''[[Panorama in Interlingua]]'', 1995, Issue 5.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to become the Czech Interlingua representative, teach Interlingua in the school system, and publish a series of articles and books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/biographias/tomin.htm Biographias: Július Tomin. Historia de Interlingua, 2001.] Revised 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interlingua today===
: ''See also: [[#Community|Community]], below''

Today, interest in Interlingua has expanded from the scientific community to the general public. Individuals, governments, and private companies use Interlingua for learning and instruction, travel, online publishing, and communication across language barriers.&lt;ref name = "breinstrup-futur"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breinstrup, Thomas, [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/tourismo.htm "Contactos directe con touristas e le gente local"], Historia de Interlingua, 2001, Revised 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stenström, Ingvar, "Experientias del inseniamento del vocabulario international in le nove gymnasio svedese" (Experiences with the teaching of the international vocabulary in the new Swedish gymnasium), ''Interlinguistica e Interlingua: Discursos public per Ingvar Stenström e Leland B. Yeager'', Beekbergen, Netherlands: Servicio de Libros UMI, 1991. (High school in Europe is often called the gymnasium.)&lt;/ref&gt; Interlingua is promoted internationally by the [[Union Mundial pro Interlingua]]. Periodicals and books are produced by many national organizations, such as the [[Societate American pro Interlingua]], the [[Swedish Society for Interlingua|Svenska Sällskapet för Interlingua]], and the [[Union Brazilian pro Interlingua]].&lt;ref name="portrait-organizations"/&gt;

== Community ==
It is not certain how many people have an active knowledge of Interlingua. As noted above, Interlingua is claimed to be the most widely spoken naturalistic [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary language]].&lt;ref name="gopsill1990"/&gt;

Interlingua's greatest advantage is that it is the most widely ''understood'' [[international auxiliary language]] besides [[Latino sine flexione|Interlingua (IL) de A.p.I.]] by virtue of its naturalistic (as opposed to schematic) grammar and vocabulary, allowing those familiar with a Romance language, and educated speakers of English, to read and understand it without prior study.&lt;ref name="blandino1989"&gt;Blandino, Giovanni, "Le problema del linguas international auxiliari", ''Philosophia del Cognoscentia e del Scientia'', Rome, Italy: Pontificia Universitas Lateranensis, Pontificia Universitas Urbaniana, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interlingua has active speakers on all continents, especially in [[South America]] and in [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Northern Europe]], most notably [[Scandinavia]]; also in [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]. There are copious Interlingua web pages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arocholaw.com/welcome/benvenite|title=AROCHO LAW OFFICE - Benvenite-Washington DC Advocato-servir organisationes sinscopo lucrative &amp; interprisas US Virgin Islands - Interlingua|work=arocholaw.com|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  including editions of [[Wikipedia]] and [[Wiktionary]], and a number of periodicals, including ''Panorama in Interlingua'' from the [[Union Mundial pro Interlingua]] (UMI) and magazines of the national societies allied with it. There are several active mailing lists, and Interlingua is also in use in certain [[Usenet]] newsgroups, particularly in the europa.* hierarchy. Interlingua is presented on CDs, radio, and television.&lt;ref&gt;"Radioemissiones in e re Interlingua," ''[[Panorama in Interlingua]]'', Issue 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interlingua is taught in many high schools and universities, sometimes as a means of teaching other languages quickly, presenting [[interlinguistics]], or introducing the international vocabulary.&lt;ref name="breinstrup-futur"&gt;Breinstrup, Thomas, [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/50annos.htm "Interlingua: Forte, Fructuose, Futur"], Historia de Interlingua, 2001, Revised 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stenström-communication"&gt;Stenström, Ingvar, “The Interlingua of IALA: From ‘the linguists’ project’ of 1951 to the working ‘tool of international scientific communication’ of 1981”, ''Interlinguistica e Interlingua: Discursos public per Ingvar Stenström e Leland B. Yeager'', Beekbergen, Netherlands: Servicio de Libros UMI, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stenström-utilisation"&gt;Stenström, Ingvar, “Utilisation de Interlingua in le inseniamento de linguas” (Utilization of Interlingua in the teaching of languages), ''Interlinguistica e Interlingua: Discursos public per Ingvar Stenström e Leland B. Yeager'', Beekbergen, Netherlands: Servicio de Libros UMI, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Granada]] in [[Spain]], for example, offers an Interlingua course in collaboration with the Centro de Formación Continua.&lt;ref&gt;"A notar," ''[[Panorama in Interlingua]],'' Issue 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every two years, the UMI organizes an international conference in a different country. In the year between, the Scandinavian Interlingua societies co-organize a conference in Sweden. National organizations such as the Union Brazilian pro Interlingua also organize regular conferences.&lt;ref name="breinstrup-futur"/&gt;

== Orthography ==
Interlingua has a largely [[phonemic orthography]].

=== Interlingua alphabet ===
Interlingua uses the 26 letters of the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]] with no [[diacritic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/interlingua.htm Interlingua Alphabet] on Omniglot&lt;/ref&gt; The alphabet, pronunciation in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] &amp; letter name in Interlingua are:

===Pronunciation===
For the most part, [[consonant]]s are pronounced as in English, while the [[vowel]]s are like Spanish. Written double consonants are pronounced as single. Interlingua has five falling [[diphthong]]s, {{IPA|/ai/, /au/, /ei/, /eu/}}, and {{IPA|/oi/}},&lt;ref&gt;Gopsill, F. P., ''Interlingua today: A course for beginners'', Sheffield, UK: British Interlingua Society, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; although {{IPA|/ei/}} and {{IPA|/oi/}} are rare.

=== Stress ===
The ''general rule'' is that stress falls on the vowel before the last consonant (e.g., ''l'''i'''ngua'', 'language', ''ess'''e'''r'', 'to be', ''requirim'''e'''nto'',  'requirement'), and where that is not possible, on the first vowel (''v'''i'''a'', 'way', '''''i'''o cr'''e'''a'', 'I create'). There are a few exceptions, and the following rules account for most of them:
* Adjectives and nouns ending in a vowel followed by ''-le, -ne,'' or ''-re'' are stressed on the third-last syllable (''fr'''a'''gile, m'''a'''rgine, '''a'''ltere'' 'other', but ''illa imp'''o'''ne'' 'she imposes').
* Words ending in ''-ica/-ico, -ide/-ido'' and ''-ula/-ulo,'' are stressed on the third-last syllable (''pol'''i'''tica, scient'''i'''fico, r'''a'''pide, st'''u'''pido, cap'''i'''tula, s'''e'''culo'' 'century').
* Words ending in ''-ic'' are stressed on the second-last syllable (''c'''u'''bic'').

Speakers may pronounce all words according to the general rule mentioned above. For example, ''kilom'''e'''tro'' is acceptable, although ''kil'''o'''metro'' is more common.&lt;ref name="gode1955"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gode|first=Alexander|authorlink=Alexander Gode|author2=[[Hugh E. Blair]] |title=Interlingua; a grammar of the international language|url=http://members.optus.net/~ado_hall/interlingua/gi/home/entry_page.html|accessdate=2007-03-05|edition=Second|origyear=1951|year=1955|publisher=Frederick Ungar Publishing|location=[[New York City|New York]]|isbn=0-8044-0186-1|oclc=147452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phonotactics ===
Interlingua has no explicitly defined [[phonotactics]]. However, the prototyping procedure for determining Interlingua words, which strives for internationality, should in general lead naturally to words that are easy for most learners to pronounce. In the process of forming new words, an ending cannot always be added without a modification of some kind in between. A good example is the plural ''-s'', which is always preceded by a vowel to prevent the occurrence of a hard-to-pronounce consonant cluster at the end. If the singular does not end in a vowel, the final ''-s'' becomes ''-es.''{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

=== Loanwords ===
Unassimilated foreign [[loanword]]s, or borrowed words, are pronounced as in their language of origin.&lt;ref name="iala1971"/&gt;

== Vocabulary ==
{{See also|Free word-building in Interlingua}}

Words in Interlingua may be taken from any language,&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Alice Vanderbilt, [http://www.interlingua.fi/ialagr45.htm#factsreasoning "IALA's system: Underlying facts and reasoning"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040702192153/http://www.interlingua.fi/ialagr45.htm |date=2004-07-02 }}, ''General report'', New York: International Auxiliary Language Association, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; as long as their internationality is verified by their presence in seven ''control'' languages: [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], and [[English language|English]], with [[German language|German]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] acting as secondary controls. These are the most widely spoken [[Romance language|Romance]], [[Germanic language|Germanic]], and [[Slavic language]]s, respectively. Because of their close relationship, Spanish and Portuguese are treated as one unit. The largest number of Interlingua words are of [[Latin language|Latin]] origin, with the [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Germanic language|Germanic]] languages providing the second and third largest number. The remainder of the vocabulary originates in [[Slavic language|Slavic]] and non-[[Indo-European languages]].&lt;ref name="iala1971"/&gt;

=== Eligibility ===
{{Main|Interlingua and eligibility of international words}}

A word, that is a form with meaning, is eligible for the Interlingua vocabulary if it is verified by at least three of the four primary control languages. Either secondary control language can substitute for a primary language. Any word of Indo-European origin found in a control language can contribute to the eligibility of an international word.&lt;ref name="interlinguistic-standardization"&gt;Stillman, E. Clark, and Gode, Alexander, ''Interlinguistic standardization'', New York: International Auxiliary Language Association, 1943. [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/publicationes/standardisation.htm Articles 82–100] translated by [[Stanley A. Mulaik]]. Revised 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the archaic or ''potential'' presence of a word can contribute to its eligibility.

A word can be potentially present in a language when a [[Morphological derivation|derivative]] is present, but the word itself is not. English ''proximity'', for example, gives support to Interlingua ''proxime'', meaning 'near, close'. This counts as long as one or more control languages actually have this basic root word, which the Romance languages all do. Potentiality also occurs when a concept is represented as a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] or derivative in a control language, the [[morpheme]]s that make it up are themselves international, and the combination adequately conveys the meaning of the larger word. An example is Italian ''fiammifero'' (lit. flamebearer), meaning "match, lucifer", which leads to Interlingua ''flammifero'', or "match". This word is thus said to be potentially present in the other languages although they may represent the meaning with a single morpheme.&lt;ref name="iala1971"/&gt;

Words do not enter the Interlingua vocabulary solely because [[cognate]]s exist in a sufficient number of languages. If [[semantic change|their meanings have become different over time]], they are considered different words for the purpose of Interlingua eligibility. If they still have one or more meanings in common, however, the word can enter Interlingua with this smaller set of meanings.&lt;ref name="interlinguistic-standardization"/&gt;

If this procedure did not produce an international word, the word for a concept was originally taken from Latin (see below). This only occurred with a few [[grammatical particle]]s.

=== Form ===
The form of an Interlingua word is considered an ''international prototype'' with respect to the other words. On the one hand, it should be neutral, free from characteristics peculiar to one language. On the other hand, it should maximally capture the characteristics common to all contributing languages. As a result, it can be transformed into any of the contributing variants using only these language-specific characteristics. If the word has any derivatives that occur in the source languages with appropriate parallel meanings, then their [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] connection must remain intact; for example, the Interlingua word for 'time' is spelled ''tempore'' and not ''*tempus'' or ''*tempo'' in order to match it with its derived adjectives, such as ''temporal''.&lt;ref&gt;Gode, Alexander, "Introduction", ''Interlingua-English: A dictionary of the international language'', Revised Edition, New York: Continuum International Publishing Group, 1971. See [https://web.archive.org/web/20071227020831/http://www.bowks.net/worldlang/aux/b_IED-intro2.html#series#series "Forms of international words in derivational series"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The language-specific characteristics are closely related to the [[sound law]]s of the individual languages; the resulting words are often close or even identical to the most recent form common to the contributing words. This sometimes corresponds with that of [[Vulgar Latin]]. At other times, it is much more recent or even contemporary. It is never older than the classical period.&lt;ref name="interlinguistic-standardization"/&gt;

=== An illustration ===
The French ''œil'', Italian ''occhio'', Spanish ''ojo'', and Portuguese ''olho'' appear quite different, but they descend from a historical form ''oculus''. German ''Auge'', Dutch ''oog'' and English ''eye'' (cf. Czech and Polish ''oko'', Ukrainian ''око'' ''(óko)'') are related to this form in that all three descend from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*okʷ''. In addition, international derivatives like ''ocular'' and ''oculista'' occur in all of Interlingua's control languages.&lt;ref name="blandino1989"/&gt; Each of these forms contributes to the eligibility of the Interlingua word.&lt;ref name="interlinguistic-standardization"/&gt; German and English base words do not influence the form of the Interlingua word, because their Indo-European connection is considered too remote.&lt;ref&gt;Gode, Alexander, "Introduction", ''Interlingua-English: A dictionary of the international language'', Revised Edition, New York: Continuum International Publishing Group, 1971. See [https://web.archive.org/web/20071227020831/http://www.bowks.net/worldlang/aux/b_IED-intro2.html#method#method "Methods and techniques: Non-Latin examples"].&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the remaining base words and especially the derivatives determine the form ''oculo'' found in Interlingua.&lt;ref name="blandino1989"/&gt;

=== Notes on Interlingua vocabulary ===
New words can be derived internally – that is, from existing Interlingua words – or extracted from the control languages in the manner of the original vocabulary. Internal word-building, though freer than in the control languages, is more limited than in schematic languages.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Originally, a word was taken from Latin if the usual procedure did not produce a sufficiently international word. More recently, modern alternatives have become generally accepted. For example, the southern Romance ''comprar'', meaning 'to buy', has replaced ''emer'', because the latter occurs only in derivatives in the control languages. Similarly, the modern form ''troppo'', 'too' or 'too much', has replaced ''nimis'', and ''ma'' 'but' has largely replaced ''sed''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

== Grammar ==
{{Main|Interlingua grammar}}

Interlingua has been developed to omit any grammatical feature that is absent from any one primary control language. Thus, Interlingua has no [[agreement (linguistics)|noun–adjective agreement]] by gender, case, or number (cf. Spanish and Portuguese ''gatas negras'' or Italian ''gatte nere'', 'black female cats'), because this is absent from English, and it has no progressive verb tenses (English ''I am reading''), because they are absent from French. Conversely, Interlingua [[grammatical number|distinguishes singular nouns from plural nouns]] because all the control languages do.&lt;ref name="gode1955"/&gt;  With respect to the secondary control languages, Interlingua has articles, unlike Russian.

The definite article ''le'' is invariable, as in English. Nouns have no [[grammatical gender]].&lt;ref name="gode1955"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wilgenhof1995"&gt;Wilgenhof, Karel. ''Grammatica de Interlingua''. Union Mundial pro Interlingua, Beekbergen, Netherlands, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Plurals are formed by adding ''-s'', or ''-es'' after a final consonant.&lt;ref name="gode1955"/&gt; [[Personal pronouns]] take one form for the subject and one for the direct object and reflexive. In the third person, the reflexive is always ''se''.&lt;ref name="gode1955"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wilgenhof1995"/&gt; Most [[adverb]]s are derived regularly from [[adjective]]s by adding ''-mente'', or ''-amente'' after a ''-c''. An adverb can be formed from any adjective in this way.&lt;ref&gt;Brauers, Karl. ''Grammatica synoptic de Interlingua''. Morges, Switzerland: Editiones Interlingua, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Verbs take the same form for all persons (''io vive, tu vive, illa vive'', 'I live', 'you live', 'she lives'). The [[indicative]] (''pare'', 'appear', 'appears') is the same as the [[Imperative mood|imperative]] (''pare!'' 'appear!'), and there is no [[subjunctive]].&lt;ref name="gode1955"/&gt; Three common verbs usually take short forms in the present tense: ''es'' for 'is', 'am', 'are;' ''ha'' for 'has', 'have;' and ''va'' for 'go', 'goes'.&lt;ref name="wilgenhof1995"/&gt; A few irregular verb forms are available, but rarely used.&lt;ref&gt;These are optional short forms for ''esser'', 'to be'. They are found in Wilgenhof, who stops short of calling them irregular verb forms. Two such forms appear in Gode and Blair, and one is labeled irregular; none are in Brauers.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four simple tenses (present, past, future, and conditional), three compound tenses (past, future, and conditional), and the passive voice. The compound structures employ an auxiliary plus the infinitive or the past participle (e.g., ''Ille ha arrivate'', 'He has arrived').&lt;ref name="gode1955"/&gt; Simple and compound tenses can be combined in various ways to express more complex tenses (e.g., ''Nos haberea morite'', 'We would have died').&lt;ref&gt;See for example Gode (1955), [http://members.optus.net/~ado_hall/interlingua/gi/parts_of_speech/verb.html#115 §115, "Table of Conjugation"], pp. 38–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Word order is [[subject–verb–object]], except that a direct object pronoun or reflexive pronoun comes before the verb (''Io les vide'', 'I see them').&lt;ref name="gode1955"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wilgenhof1995"/&gt; Adjectives may precede or follow the nouns they modify, but they most often follow it.&lt;ref name="gode1955"/&gt; The position of adverbs is flexible, though constrained by common sense.&lt;ref name="wilgenhof1995"/&gt;

The grammar of Interlingua has been described as similar to that of the Romance languages, but greatly simplified, primarily under the influence of English.&lt;ref name="gode1955"/&gt; More recently, Interlingua's grammar has been likened to the simple grammars of Japanese and particularly Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Yeager, Leland B., "Artificialitate, ethnocentrismo, e le linguas oriental: Le caso de Interlingua", ''Interlinguistica e Interlingua: Discursos public per Ingvar Stenstrom e Leland B. Yeager'', Beekbergen, Netherlands: Servicio de Libros UMI, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms and controversies ==
{{multiple issues|section=yes|
{{criticism section|date=December 2012}}
{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
}}

Some opponents{{Who|date=January 2010}} argue that, being based on a few [[Standard Average European|European languages]], Interlingua is best suited for speakers of European languages. Others contend that Interlingua has spelling irregularities that, while internationally recognizable in written form, increase the time needed to fully learn the language, especially for those unfamiliar with Indo-European languages. A related point of criticism is that Interlingua's credential as being [[Standard Average European]] is too weak outside the Romance languages. Some opponents see the [[Germanic language|Germanic]], [[Slavic language|Slavic]], and [[Celtic language]]s, in particular, as having little influence.

Proponents{{Who|date=January 2010}} argue that Interlingua's source languages include not only Romance languages but English, German, and Russian as well. Moreover, the source languages are widely spoken internationally, and large numbers of their words also appear in other languages – still more when derivative forms and [[loan translation]]s are included. Tests had shown that if a larger number of source languages were used, the results would be about the same.&lt;ref name="iala1971"/&gt; So, IALA selected a much simpler extraction procedure for Interlingua with little adverse effect on its internationality.

== Samples ==
From an essay by Alexander Gode:

:''Interlingua se ha distachate ab le movimento pro le disveloppamento e le introduction de un lingua universal pro tote le humanitate. Si o non on crede que un lingua pro tote le humanitate es possibile, si o non on crede que interlingua va devenir un tal lingua es totalmente indifferente ab le puncto de vista de interlingua mesme. Le sol facto que importa (ab le puncto de vista de interlingua mesme) es que interlingua, gratias a su ambition de reflecter le homogeneitate cultural e ergo linguistic del occidente, es capace de render servicios tangibile a iste precise momento del historia del mundo. Il es per su contributiones actual e non per le promissas de su adherentes que interlingua vole esser judicate.''&lt;ref&gt;''Novas de Interlingua'', May/June 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

:Interlingua has detached itself from the movement for the development and introduction of a universal language for all humanity. Whether or not one believes that a language for all humanity is possible, whether or not one believes that Interlingua will become such a language is totally irrelevant from the point of view of Interlingua itself. The only fact that matters (from the point of view of Interlingua itself) is that Interlingua, thanks to its ambition of reflecting the cultural and thus linguistic homogeneity of the West, is capable of rendering tangible services at this precise moment in the history of the world. It is by its present contributions and not by the promises of its adherents that Interlingua wishes to be judged.

==Flags and symbols==
[[File:Flag of Interlingua.svg|thumb|upright|Flag of Interlingua by [[Karel Podrazil]]]]
[[File:Interlingua2.png|thumb|upright|Another flag of Interlingua]]

As with Esperanto, there have been proposals for a flag of Interlingua;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140416192338/http://fotw.net/flags/qy-ia.html Flags of Interlingua (IALA)] from fotw.net (archived URL)&lt;/ref&gt; the proposal by Czech translator Karel Podrazil is recognized by multilingual sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airbagjacket.eu/jachetta_airbag.html |title=Toto super le airbag jachetta e gilet / jachetta e gilet con airbag (invento hungaro) - interlingua - All about Airbag Jacket and Airbag Vest |website=Airbagjacket.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a white four-pointed star extending to the edges of the flag and dividing it into an upper blue and lower red half. The star is symbolic of the four cardinal directions, and the two halves symbolize Romance and non-Romance speakers of Interlingua who understand each other.

Another symbol of Interlingua is a globe surrounded by twelve stars on a black or blue background, echoing the twelve stars of the [[Flag of Europe]] (because the source languages of Interlingua are purely European). [[Novial]] [{{fullurl:nov:}} Wikipedia] marks Interlingua with the Flag of Europe itself.

[[File:Double cosmetic tube Louvre MNC1825.jpg|thumb|right|125px|A 4th-century AD double cosmetic tube for kohl from the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre Museum]] in [[Paris]].]]
'''Kohl''' ({{lang-ar|كُحْل}} kuḥl) is an ancient eye [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]], traditionally made by grinding [[stibnite]] (Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) for similar purposes to charcoal used in mascara. It is widely used in the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], the [[Mediterranean]], [[South Asia]], and the [[Horn of Africa]] as [[eyeliner]] to contour and/or darken the eyelids and as [[mascara]] for the eyelashes. It is worn mostly by women, but also by some men and children.

Kohl has also been used in [[India]] as a cosmetic for a long time. In addition, mothers would apply kohl to their infants' eyes soon after birth. Some did this to "strengthen the child's eyes", and others believed it could prevent the child from being cursed by the [[evil eye]].&lt;ref name="hardy cairo"&gt;Hardy A, Walton R, Vaishnav R., Int J Environ Health Res. 2004 Feb;14(1):83–91.

[[File:Kohl Tube LACMA M.76.97.81.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ancient kohl cosmetic tube from western [[Iran]], dated 800-500 BCE.]]
The Arabic name {{lang|ar|كحل|rtl=yes}} {{transl|ar|DIN|''kuḥl''}} and the [[Biblical Hebrew]] {{lang|he|כחל  |rtl=yes}} {{lang|he-Latn|kaḥal}} 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3583&amp;t=KJV Strong's Concordance H3583]&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. modern Hebrew [[:wikt:כחול|כחול]] "blue") are cognates, from a Semitic root ''k-ḥ-l''. Transliteration variants of Arabic dialectal pronunciation include ''kohl'' or ''kuhl''.

The English word ''[[:wikt:alcohol|alcohol]]'' is a loan of the Arabic word (via [[Middle Latin]] and French; originally in the sense "powder of [[antimony]]"; the modern meaning is from the 18th century).

The Persian word for kohl is سرمه ''sormeh'', from Turkish ''sürme'' "drawing along", which has led to Hindi and Urdu ''surma'' (सुरमा, سرمہ) as well as Russian [[:wikt:сурьма|сурьма]]. In some [[South Asia|South Asian]] languages, the term ''kājal'' is used. This last term may originally have a [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] root.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McGregor |first1=R.S. |title=The Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary |date=1993 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0195638462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hausa, it is also known as ''tozali'' and ''kwalli''.&lt;ref&gt;Kay Lazar [https://archive.is/20130118145135/http://articles.boston.com/2012-08-03/news/32993408_1_low-levels-children-with-high-levels-health-risks Folk remedy linked to baby’s high lead levels], Boston Globe, 2 August 2012.

Kohl has been worn traditionally since the [[Protodynastic Period of Egypt]] (ca. 3100 BCE) by Egyptian queens and noble women, who used [[stibnite]] (the sulfide of [[antimony]] rather than of lead). The [[cosmetic palette]]s used for its preparation assumed a prominent role in the late [[Predynastic Egypt]]ian culture.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Kohl was originally used as protection against eye ailments.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} There was also a belief that darkening around the eyes would protect one from the harsh rays of the sun.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

[[Galena]] eye paint (later termed ''Kohl'' in Arabic from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word for the cosmetic) was widely applied in [[Ancient Egypt]]. Upper eyelids were painted black and lower ones were colored green, as depicted in ancient texts that describe the use of both black galena and green [[malachite]]. Ancient graves from the pre-historic [[Tasian culture|Tasian]] culture point to the early application of galena in Egypt, a custom stretching from the [[Badari culture|Badarian]] period through to the [[Coptic history|Coptic]] era. Although found locally, both black galena and green malachite were also imported from nearby regions in [[Western Asia]], [[Coptos]] and the [[Land of Punt]].&lt;ref name="Stiant"&gt;''Studies in Ancient Technology'', Volume III, (Brill Archive), p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]] Ancient Egyptian Queen [[Hatshepsut]] would also grind charred [[frankincense]] into kohl eyeliner. This is the first recorded use of the resin.&lt;ref name="Isaac14"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Isaac|first1=Michael|title=A Historical Atlas of Oman|date=2004|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=0823945006|page=14|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=gTgdRuWa9xMC|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frankincense itself had originally been obtained during an expedition to the ancient Land of Punt in this [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] dynasty ({{circa}} 1500 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin Watt, Wanda Sellar|title=Frankincense &amp; Myrrh: Through the Ages, and a complete guide to their use in herbalism and aromatherapy today|date=2012|publisher=Random House|isbn=1446490777|page=24|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=fxTgyhyMTLwC&amp;pg=PT24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the pioneering Muslim scholar Ibn Abi Shayba described in a legal compilation how to apply kohl to the eye, as narrated by earlier authorities.&lt;ref name="Swain"&gt;{{cite book|last=Simon Swain|first=George Boys-Stones|title=Seeing the Face, Seeing the Soul: Polemon's Physiognomy from Classical Antiquity to Medieval Islam|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199291535|page=277|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-I79HM8aKWIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Berber people|Berber]] and [[Arab]] women in [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], respectively, also apply kohl to their faces. A vertical line is drawn from the bottom lip to the chin and along the bridge of the nose. Originally the line from the bottom lip to the chin shows whether a woman is married or not. This form of using Kohl on the face originates from the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and was introduced in the 7th century in North-Africa.&lt;ref&gt;''Many Mirrors: Body Image and Social Relations''.

==Horn of Africa==
[[File:Ucidlhd29.png|thumb|right|A [[Somali people|Somali]] woman with ''indha kuul'' ("kohl eyes").]]
Usage of kohl eye paint in the [[Horn of Africa]] dates to the ancient Kingdom of Punt.&lt;ref name="Stiant"/&gt; [[Somali people|Somali]], [[Djibouti]]an, [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopian]] and [[Eritrea]]n women have long applied kohl (''kuul'') for cosmetic purposes, as well as to cleanse the eyes, lengthen eyelashes, and to protect the eyes from the sun's rays.&lt;ref name="Loughran"&gt;Katheryne S. Loughran, ''Somalia in word and image'', (Foundation for Cross Cultural Understanding: 1986), p.166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Selassie"&gt;Sergew Hable Selassie, ''Ancient and medieval Ethiopian history to 1270'', (Printed by United Printers: 1972), p.26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==West Africa==
Kohl is also applied in parts of [[West Africa]] by the [[Fulani people|Fulani]] and the affiliated [[Hausa people]].&lt;ref name="Donovan"&gt;Alan Donovan, ''My journey through African Heritage'', (Kenway Publications: 2004), p.62.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is used by the [[Tuareg]], [[Wolof people|Wolof]], [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]], [[Soninke people|Soninke]], [[Dagomba people|Dagomba]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]], and other predominantly [[Muslim]] inhabitants of the [[Sahel]] and [[Sahara]] regions. Kohl is used by both sexes, and by people of all ages, mainly during weddings, Islamic festivals (such as [[Eid ul Fitr]] and [[Eid ul Adha]]), and trips to the mosque for the weekly [[Jumuah]] congregational prayer.

For women, kohl or black-[[henna]] is applied to the face as well in a similar manner as that practiced by communities in North Africa.

==South Asia==
[[File:India - Varanasi old food seller and granddaughter - 0604.jpg|thumb|A [[Varanasi]] food seller with his granddaughter wearing kohl.]]
[[File:It's a boy - Khol Kajal kanmashi kan mai eyeliner infants evil eye Buri nazar drishti bommai काजल கண் மை surma Tamil Nadu village India Documentary Featur story jpg photo IMG 3192 signed.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Tamil Nadu|Tamil]] woman applying kohl on her son in [[India]].]]
Kohl is known by various names in South Asian languages, like ''surma'' in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]] and [[Urdu]], ''kajal'' in [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], ''kajal'' in Sanskrit, ''kajalh'' in [[Marathi language|Marathi]], ''kanmashi'' in [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], ''kaadige'' in [[Kannada language|Kannada]], ''kaatuka'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and ''kan mai'' in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. In India, it is used by women as a type of eyeliner that is put around the edge of the eyes. In many parts of India, especially in Southern India, [[Karnataka]] in particular, women of the household prepare the kajal. This homemade kajal is used even for infants. Local tradition considers it to be a very good coolant for the eyes and believes that it protects the eyesight and vision from the sun.

Some Indian Ayurvedic or Ancient Indian Herbal medicines manufacturing companies add camphor and other medicinal herbs that are beneficial for eyes in their kajal. It can serve not only as a cosmetic but also as medicine for the eyes.

In [[Punjabi culture]], surma is a traditional ceremonial dye, which predominantly men of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] wear around their eyes on special social or religious occasions. It is usually applied by the wife or the mother of the person.

Some women also add a dot of kajal on the left side of the foreheads or on the waterline of the eye of women and children to ward off ''buri nazar''. ''Buri nazar'' literally means 'bad glance' and is comparable to the '[[evil eye]]', although it can be interpreted as ill-wishes of people or even lustful eyes, in the sense of men ogling women. It signifies that the person is not perfect, with them having 'black mark', and hence, people wouldn't be jealous of their beauty.
In the centuries-old Indian Bharatnatayam dances, the dancers apply heavy kohl to their eyes so as to draw attention to their eye gestures and movement. The kohl is then applied to eyebrows and eyelids to add further enhancement to the dancers.

==Kohl and Islam==
[[File:Colored Beard (4268537596).jpg|thumb|250 px|left|upright|[[Pushtun]] man with kohl applied under eyes and beard dyed with [[henna]].]] 
According to Islamic belief, the use of a particular type of kohl is thought to be healing and used for medicinal purposes for both men and women. This is based on the following saying by the Prophet Muhammed: "One of the best kinds of kohl that you use is Ithmid (antimony); it brightens the vision and makes the hair (eye-lashes) grow."&lt;ref&gt;[https://sunnah.com/nasai/48/74 “Sunan an-Nasa'i 5113: Vol. 6, Book 48, Hadith 5116”]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a tradition in some Muslim countries for men to apply kohl to their eyes during Ramadan. However this practice is not necessarily based on any authentic sources. &lt;ref&gt; [https://sunnah.com/urn/2059180 “Bulugh al-Maram The Book on Fasting: Book 5, Hadith 689”]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merdeka.com/ramadan/foto/005/tradisi-unik-muslim-yaman-rias-mata-dengan-kohl-saat-ramadan.html Merdeka: "Tradisi unik muslim Yaman rias mata dengan kohl saat Ramadan"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/32/98/134432/Folk/Folk-Arts/Proverb-of-the-day-Instead-of-applying-kohl-to-her.aspx "Proverb of the day: Instead of applying kohl to her eyes, he blinded her"] ''Ahram Online''.

Modern day [[Salafi]] Muslims use kohl as they believe it was the practice of the Prophet Muhammed. &lt;ref&gt;[https://sunnah.com/urn/1275430 “Sunan Ibn Majah Chapters on Medicine: Book 31, Hadith 3627”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sunnah.com/urn/635160 “Jami’ at-Tirmidhi Chapters on Virtues Vol. 1, Book 46, Hadith 3645”]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
Preparation of homemade kajal begins with dipping a clean, white, thin muslin cloth, about four by four inches square, in [[sandalwood]] paste or the juice of [[Alstonia scholaris]] (Manjal karisilanganni), which is then dried in the shade. This dip and dry process is done all day long. After sunset, a wick is made out of the cloth, which is then used to light a mud lamp filled with [[castor oil]]. A brass vessel is kept over the lamp, leaving a little gap, just enough for the oxygen to aid the burning of the lamp. This is left burning overnight. In the morning, one or two drops of pure [[ghee]] (clarified cow's butter) or castor oil are added to the soot which now lines the brass vessel. It is then stored in a clean dry box.

All the ingredients used in this preparation (sandalwood/Manjal karsilanganni, castor oil, ghee) are believed to have medicinal properties. They are still used in Indian therapies like [[ayurveda]] and [[Siddha]] medicines.

In rural Bengal, kajal is made from the "Monosha" plant, a type of succulent spurge (''Euphorbia neriifolia''). The leaf of Monosha is covered with oil and is kept above a burning diya (mud lamp). Within minutes the leaf is covered with creamy soft black soot which is so safe and sterile that it is even applied to infants.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Health concerns==
The content of kohl and the recipes to prepare it vary greatly. In North Africa and Middle East, homemade kohl is often made by grinding [[galena]] ([[Lead(II) sulfide|lead sulfide]]). In the west, manufacturers use [[amorphous carbon]] or organic [[charcoal]] instead of lead. Plant oils and the soot from various nuts, seeds, and gum [[resin]]s are often added to the carbon powder. Unfortunately, the non-lead products are considered to be of inferior quality to the older, traditional varieties and therefore there has been an increase in the use of handmade, lead-based kohl.
[[File:Killedan.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] kohl (''kil'') set.]]
For decades various conflicting reports in the literature have been published relating to kohl application to eyes being responsible for causing higher blood lead concentration, which may cause lead poisoning. While at the same time, a number of research studies and reports have also been published refuting any such links with increased blood lead level upon kohl (surma) application.&lt;ref name="mahmood"&gt;Mahmood ZA, Zoha SM, Usmanghani K, Hasan MM, Ali O, Jahan S, Saeed A, Zaihd R, Zubair M., Pak. ''J. Pharm. Sci.'', Vol.22, No.1, January 2009, pp. 107–122. "KOHL (SURMA): RETROSPECT AND PROSPECT"&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of researchers in China tried to find some scientific basis of this claimed property of lead sulphide 
(galena) relating to absorption of sun rays when applied into the eyes in the form of kohl.&lt;ref name="li yun"&gt;Li-Yun C, Wen H, Jian-Feng H and Jian-Peng W (2008). "Influence of deposition voltage on properties of lead sulfide thin film." ''American Ceramic Society Bulletin'', 87(6): 9101–9104&lt;/ref&gt; The authors reported the ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectra of a thin film of lead sulphide prepared on "Indium Tin Oxide" (ITO) substrate.  The spectra showed that lead sulphide thin films had higher absorption and lower transmittance in UV light band which further increases with the increased deposition voltage.

The drive to eliminate lead from kohl was sparked by studies in the early 1990s of preparations of kohl that found high levels of contaminants, including lead.&lt;ref name="hardy oman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;al-Hazzaa SA, Krahn PM., ''Int Ophthalmol''. 1995;19(2):83–8. "Kohl: a hazardous eyeliner."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="parry"&gt;Parry C, Eaton J., ''[[Environ Health Perspect]]''. 1991 Aug;94:121–3. "Kohl: a lead-hazardous eye makeup from the Third World to the First World."&lt;/ref&gt; Lead levels in commercial kohl preparations were as high as 84%. Kohl samples from [[Oman]] and Cairo, analyzed using [[powder diffraction|X-ray powder diffraction]] and [[scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]], found [[galena]].&lt;ref name="hardy cairo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hardy oman"&gt;Hardy AD, Vaishnav R, Al-Kharusi SS, Sutherland HH, Worthing MA., ''[[J Ethnopharmacol]]''. 1998 Apr;60(3):223–34. "Composition of eye cosmetics (kohls) used in Oman."&lt;/ref&gt; One decade later, a study of kohl manufactured in Egypt and India found that a third of the samples studied contained lead, while the remaining two-thirds contained amorphous carbon,&lt;ref name="hardy cairo"/&gt; [[zincite]],&lt;ref name="hardy cairo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hardy oman"/&gt; [[cuprite]],&lt;ref name="hardy cairo"/&gt; [[goethite]],&lt;ref name="hardy cairo"/&gt; elemental [[silicon]]&lt;ref name="hardy cairo"/&gt; or [[talc]],&lt;ref name="hardy cairo"/&gt; [[hematite]], [[minium]],&lt;ref name="hardy oman"/&gt; and organic compounds.&lt;ref name="hardy cairo"/&gt;

Lead-contaminated kohl use has been linked to increased levels of lead in the bloodstream,&lt;ref&gt;Alkhawajah AM. "Alkohl use in Saudi Arabia: Extent of use and possible lead toxicity." ''Tropical Geographical Medicine'', 1992 Oct; 44(4):373–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Saleh I, Nester M. DeVol E, Shinwari N, Al-Shahria S. "Determinants of blood lead levels in Saudi Arabian schoolgirls." ''International Journal of Environmental Health'', 1999 Apr–Jun; 5(2):107–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nir A, Tamir A, Nelnik N, Iancu TC. "Is eye cosmetic a source of lead poisoning?" ''Israel Journal of Medical Science'', 1992 Jul; 28(7):417–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;# Rahbar MH, White F, Agboatwalla M, Hozhbari S, and Luby S. "Factors associated with elevated blood lead concentrations in children in Karachi, Pakistan." ''[[Bulletin of the World Health Organization]]''. 2002, 80(10):769–775.&lt;/ref&gt; putting its users at risk of [[lead poisoning]] and [[lead intoxication]]. Complications of lead poisoning include [[anemia]], [[growth retardation]], low [[intelligence quotient|IQ]], [[convulsions]], and in severe cases, death. Anemia from lead poisoning is of special concern in Middle Eastern and South Asian countries where other forms of anemia are prevalent, including [[iron deficiency anemia]] (from malnutrition) and [[hemoglobinopathy]] ([[sickle cell anemia]], [[thalassemia]]).

These banned products are different from lead-free cosmetics that use the term "kohl" only to describe its shade/color, rather than its actual ingredients. Some modern eye cosmetics are marketed as "kohl", but are prepared differently and in accordance with relevant health standards.

Eye cosmetics such as surma are recognized as one of the important sources of lead exposure in [[Pakistan]]. As adverse health effects of [[heavy metals]] are a [[public]] health concern, where especially lead may cause negative health impacts to human [[Fetus|fetal]] and [[infant]]ile development, a study in Pakistan of [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] women' [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]] in 2016, showed thirteen nail samples out of 84 nails analyzed, contained lead higher than the concentration (13.6 μg/g) of the fatal lead poisoning case, with the possibility of an external contamination. The observations showed that lead-containing surma consists of fine particle of [[galena]] (ore of [[Lead(II) sulfide|lead sulfide]]) in [[Respiratory system|respirable]] dust range (less than 10 μm) and relative [[in vitro]] [[bioavailability]] of lead in the surma was determined as 5.2%. Thus, lead-containing surma consists of [[Inhalation|inhalable]] and bioavailable particles, and it contributes an increased risk of lead exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ikegami|first=Akihiko|last2=Takagi|first2=Mai|last3=Fatmi|first3=Zafar|last4=Kobayashi|first4=Yayoi|last5=Ohtsu|first5=Mayumi|last6=Cui|first6=Xiaoyi|last7=Mise|first7=Nathan|last8=Mizuno|first8=Atsuko|last9=Sahito|first9=Ambreen|date=2016-11-01|title=External lead contamination of women's nails by surma in Pakistan: Is the biomarker reliable?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749116306431|journal=Environmental Pollution|volume=218|issue=Supplement C|pages=723–727|doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2016.07.068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Blue" Kohl is a dark-bluish black pigment composed of both lead-based compounds as well as a compound of antimony. The lead-based compounds in kohl are [[galena]] (PbS) – dark grey and gloss [[laurionite]] ( PbCl(OH)) – white [[phosgenite]] ((PbCl)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;); [[cerussite]] (PbCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) – blue. The antimony-based compound in kohl is stibnite (Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) – blue.

In January 2010, French researchers reported that the particular heavy eye makeup that ancient Egyptians wore may have had medical benefits.  At submicromolar concentrations, the specially made lead compounds can elicit overproduction of [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), which in turn can trigger an enhancement of the immune response.&lt;ref&gt;Tapsoba, et al. ''Journal of Analytic Chemistry'' 2010 http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ac902348g&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/01/100114-cleopatra-eye-makeup-ancient-egyptians/ "Cleopatra's eye makeup"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Egyptians, documented in the [[Ebers Papyrus]] ({{circa}} 1550 BCE), discuss these compounds within kohl as protective for the eyes. Indeed, kohl was used an eyeliner and cosmetic. There are a number of endemic ocular diseases in the Nile region including [[trachoma]], a chlamydial organism which can cause corneal scarring and conjunctival cicatricial disease, with visual loss. Kohl was used not only as a cosmetic but also as a medicinal [[collyrium]] (from Gr. kollurion). Two of kohl's lead compounds — the lead chlorides laurionite and phosgenite — were not natural to the Nile valley. It is believed they were intentionally synthesized by the ancient Egyptians for this purpose. The widespread use of kohl across the Mediterranean and the Mid-east attests to its ability to protect the eye from infectious disease and be used as a cosmetic.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/bodyhorrors/2012/04/20/ophthalmology-of-the-pharaohs/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal status===
Kohl is not on the list of color additives approved by the Food and Drug Administration, which considers kohl unsafe for use due to its potential lead content. It is thus illegal to import into, or sell in, the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/productsingredients/products/ucm137250.htm|accessdate=2017-10-26|title=Kohl, Kajal, Al-Kahal, Surma, Tiro, Tozali, or Kwalli: By Any Name, Beware of Lead Poisoning|publisher=Food and Drug Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24423">The '''lines of partition''' used to [[division of the field|divide]] and [[variations of the field|vary]] [[field (heraldry)|fields]] and charges in [[heraldry]] are by default straight, but may have many different shapes.  Care must sometimes be taken to distinguish these types of lines from the extremely unusual and non-traditional use of lines as charges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Heraldry/ArmyBFBT/ArmyBFBTUnit.aspx?u=4892 |title=1 Squadron 91 Cavalry Regiment |publisher=[[United States Army Institute of Heraldry|The Institute of Heraldry]] |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to distinguish these shapes from actual charges, such as "a mount [or triple mount] in base," or, particularly in [[German heraldry]], different kinds of embattled from castle walls.

In [[Scotland]], varied lines of partition are often used to modify a [[bordure]] (or sometimes another [[ordinary (heraldry)|ordinary]]) to difference the arms of a [[cadency|cadet]] from the chief of the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldry-scotland.co.uk/beginners.html |title=Beginners Heraldry |author=Mark Harden |work=The Heraldry Society of Scotland |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013201010/http://www.heraldry-scotland.co.uk/beginners.html |archivedate=2008-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indented and dancetty ==
[[File:Dentelé.png|thumb|Per fess indented argent and gules]]
An ordinary ''indented'' is bounded by small zigzags like a [[triangle wave]], with peaks on one side matching peaks on the other.  An ordinary ''dancetty'' is similar, but with peaks matching troughs, so that the width is constant; it also typically has fewer points than ''indented''.  In early armory these were not distinguished.  In the arms of the [[55th Electronic Combat Group]] of the [[United States Air Force]] the indented is "edged wider on the back angle (sinister) than on the face (dexter) of each angle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=55th Electronic Combat Group|url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Heraldry/AirForce/AirForceUnit.aspx?u=6297|accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dentilly'' is a modern invention, similar to ''indented'', but with one of the sides of the points perpendicular and the other angled, as in a [[sawtooth wave]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

''Rayonné'' (also ''rayonne'', ''rayonny''; from French ''[[wikt:rayonner|rayonner]]'') may be considered a variant of indented, but with wavy instead of straight lines, as in the conventional representation of rays of the sun.  ''Rayonne palewise'' appears in the arms of the 172d Support Battalion of the United States Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=172 Support Battalion|url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Heraldry/ArmyDUISSICOA/ArmyHeraldryUnit.aspx?u=4486|publisher=The Institute of Heraldry|accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A chief enarched rayonné on a gold field appears in the arms of [[Sechelt]], British Columbia, forming the appearance of a sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=District of Sechelt|url=http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=621&amp;ProjectElementID=2198|publisher=The Governor General of Canada|website=Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada|date=14 June 1996|accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arms of the Worshipful Company of Security Professionals contain an example of ''indented acute,'' a form of indented with higher peaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=June 2008 Newsletter (No. 17) – College of Arms|url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/news-grants/newsletter/2008/item/49-june-2008-newsletter-no-17|accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of peaks in indented is almost never specified, but an exception is the arms of Arthur D. Stairs: ''Per bend sinister indented of six steps Gules and Sable'', and Westville, Natal, South Africa bears ''Sable, issuant from behind a fence of spears in base Argent, a fig tree in leaf  Or;  on a chief indented of four points to base, also Or, three lion's faces Sable''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In South Africa there are a number of examples of ''dancetty inverted''.  While the number of peaks in dancetty are three unless otherwise specified, the arms of Wagland show ''dancetty of two points''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitelionsociety.co.uk/armorial/wagland.html|title=Wagland|work=The White Lion Society|accessdate=2011-06-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722004657/http://www.whitelionsociety.co.uk/armorial/wagland.html|archivedate=2011-07-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the arms of Baz Manning show a chief "dancetty of two full points upwards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldic-arts.com/article-manning1.htm|title=The Call to Arms – Baz Manning|work=Society of Heraldic Arts|accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The arms of the Matroosberg Transitional Representative Council in South Africa give an example of ''dancetty… in the shape of a letter W''.  The arms of the French department of [[Côtes d'Armor]] show ''émanché,'' which would be equivalent to the English ''per fess dancetty of two full points upwards.''  The arms of [[Baron Griffiths of Fforestfach]] are ''Paly of four Vert and Argent per fess enhanced indented of two points upwards each point double barbed throughout issuing in base a pile double barbed throughout all counterchanged''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.theheraldrysociety.com/publications/heraldrygazette/2007-Dec.pdf |title=Heraldry of New Life Peers |author=Peter Ll Gwynn-Jones |work=The Heraldry Gazette |date=December 2007 |issue=106 |series=New |pages=10–11 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arms of Alaric John Martin Woodrow show an example of ''barry dancetty each point double barbed'', used to represent a line of fir trees as a play on the surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=583&amp;ProjectElementID=2054 |title=Alaric John Martin Woodrow |work=The Canadian Heraldic Authority |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [https://web.archive.org/web/20040103093950/http://www.polity.org.za/html/govdocs/misc/fscoat.html arms of the Free State] in [[South Africa]] show "a chief dancetty, the peaks terminating in merlons," and so might be called a combination of dancetty and embattled; a similar hybrid can be seen in the arms of the Agricultural Gymnasium.  Hoerskool Hangklip provide an example of ''dancetty with points flattened'', and Blouberg of ''dancetty the peaks couped.''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708091915/http://sahw.bravehost.com/e-des.htm]  It is difficult to know whether to characterise the "wall-like extremity with five merlons and four embrasures" in the arms of the [[Kurgan Oblast]] in Russia as a divided field or a charge.[http://www.heraldry.hobby.ru/eng/e.kurgan.html]

The arms of Ernest John Altobello show a chevronel with the upper edge ''grady'' (this is identical in appearance to indented) "and ensigned of a tower Argent".

== Wavy and nebuly ==
[[File:Nébulé.png|thumb|Per fess nebuly argent and gules]]
A line ''wavy'' (also called ''undy'')&lt;ref name="line"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mackinnon of Dunakin, Charles |title=The Observer's Book of Heraldry |year=1968 |publisher=Frederick Warne and Co. Ltd. |pages=48–50 |accessdate=2015-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[sine wave]], often used to represent water; a line ''[[nebuly]]'' is similar but with more exaggerated [[meander]]s, representing clouds.  There are confusing, ambiguous and non-standard uses of ''a wavy'' in the military heraldry of the United States to refer to irregularly wavy lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.afcyber.af.mil/News/Imagery/igphoto/2000153626/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wavy chief in the arms of Lord Nelson was blazoned as ''undulated''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baronage.co.uk/nl/nl-02-07.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of the arms of the 40th Finance Battalion of the United States Army is blazoned [https://web.archive.org/web/20110610173340/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Heraldry/ArmyDUISSICOA/ArmyHeraldryUnit.aspx?u=3569 ''per fess wavy (in the manner of a Taeguk)'']  The chief in the arms of Professor S.W.

In ''wavy crested'' the waves appear like pointed breakers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snodgrass-clan.com/grant.html{{Dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arms of James Hill show an example of barrulets ''wavy crested to the sinister on the upper edge''.&lt;ref&gt;http://heraldry-scotland.com/copgal/displayimage.php?album=7&amp;pos=97&lt;/ref&gt; There are examples of even greater complexity and specificity in the ''wavy'' line, such as the arms of "Baron Nolan ... [which include] three 'bars wavy couped composed of two troughs and a wave invected of one point on the upper edge and engrailed of one point on the lower edge'".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grsampson.net/AHtc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Specification of the number of "undulations" in nebuly can be seen by [https://web.archive.org/web/20110721191327/http://www.americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=Armorial.WilkeJ Jochen Wilke]'s roundel, with ten.  (It is uncommon for lines of partition to modify a charge other than an ordinary.)

== Engrailed and invected ==
[[File:Blason duche fr Berry (moderne).svg|thumb|The [[duke of Berry|ducs de Berry]] bore the French royal arms with ''a [[bordure]] engrailed [[gules]]'' for difference.]]

These lines consist of a series of circular arcs curving in the same direction, meeting at angles, forming points outward (''engrailed'') or inward (''invected'').  When these terms are applied to a partition rather than to an ordinary, the first part of the field is the "interior".

The arms of [[Liverpool Hope University]] include ''a Cross engrailed of one point on each limb''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arms, Crest, Supporters and Badge of Liverpool Hope University - College of Arms|url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/news-grants/grants/item/19-liverpool-hope-uni|publisher=College of Arms|accessdate=1 July 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Flag of Flintshire]] is ''Argent a cross engrailed sable between four Cornish choughs proper''.

== Embattled and variants == &lt;!-- courtesy note per [[WP:RSECT]]: [[Embattled (heraldry)]] links here. --&gt;
[[File:Bresseté.png|thumb|Argent, a fess bretessé gules]]
A line ''embattled'' is a [[square wave]], representing the [[battlements]] of a castle.

When a fess is embattled, only the topmost edge is altered (as in the arms of [[Muri bei Bern]]). If both edges are to be embattled, the term ''embattled-counter-embattled'' (or ''counter-embattled,'' as in the arms of Sir Cecil Denniston Burney) is used. In this case the lines are parallel. If gaps face gaps, the term ''bretessé'' is used.  There is at least one emblazonment suggesting that the orle is only embattled on its outer edge.

Italian armory has a variant, [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibelline]] battlement, with notched merlons.
&lt;!-- What's the exact phrase? something ''alla ghibellina'', I think --&gt;

In a line ''raguly'' the extensions are oblique rather than orthogonal, like the stumps of limbs protruding from a tree-trunk.

''[[dovetail joint|Dovetailed]]'' is as in carpentry.  Unlike embattled, gaps face gaps.

''Potenty'' may be considered a variant in which the points are extended to ''T''-shapes ("potent" means a crutch).

A line ''embattled grady''[http://www.armorial-register.com/arms-es/moore-sr-arms.html] or ''battled embattled''[https://web.archive.org/web/20031224175209/http://www.theheraldrysociety.com/resources/andersdaae.htm] consists of series of two or three steps, as if each [[merlon]] has a smaller merlon atop it.  Parker's glossary says that ''double-embattled'' may be the same as this.

The arms of [[Schellenberg]], in [[Liechtenstein]], provide an example of embattled "with three battlements."[http://www.ngw.nl/int/oveur/schellen.htm]  The [[bordure]] in the arms of [[Boissy l'Aillerie]], in [[Val d'Oise]], [[France]], has nine battlements (and the bordure is also masoned and contains doorlike openings).

A very unusual occurrence of embattled occurs in the arms of the 136th Military Police Battalion of the United States Army: ''Sable, a fesse enhanced and embattled Or, overall a magnifying glass palewise rim Argent (Silver Gray), the glass surmounting and enlarging the middle crenel between two merlons, the handle Gules edged of the second bearing a mullet Argent.''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060507150742/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/MP/136MilitaryPoliceBattalion.htm]

The arms of [[Baron Kirkwood]] show two chevronels ''round embattled'' (the merlons are rounded rather than squares).  There are also examples of ''embattled pointed''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708091915/http://sahw.bravehost.com/e-des.htm] and ''embattled in the form of mine dumps''.

James Parker cites the arms of Christopher Draisfield: "Gules, a chevron raguly of two bastons couped at the top argent."

The arms of Zodwa Special School for Severely Mentally Handicapped Children show a chevron dovetailed, the peak ensigned with a potent issuant''.

Some examples also exist of ''urdy,'' where the line is in the shapes of the upside-down and rightside-up "shields" of [[vair]] (this is to be distinguished from ''couped urdy'', in which the couping takes a pointed form [https://web.archive.org/web/20060507150804/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/MP/231MilitaryPoliceBattalion.htm]).  The arms of Winfried Paul Reinhold Steinhagen are ''Per chevron, the peak in the form of a merlon round urdy of four, Gules and Or, in chief a horse forcene and a goat clymant respecting one another, Argent, and in base a bull's head Sable armed Argent; a chief per fess in the form of a wall with three watchtowers, Azure and Argent, the latter charged with a strand of barbed wire throughout, Sable''.  The "unusual, if not unique" arms of Lourens Du Toit are ''Per fess of three pallets urdy Sable and Or''.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708091926/http://sahw.bravehost.com/p-pers2.htm]

The arms of the [[Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20060819090850/http://www.racds.org/college/college_arms] have a bordure emblazoned "dentate," although this appears to be quite similar to dovetailed.

== Embowed, nowy and variants ==

A line ''embowed'' consists of a single arch.

A line ''nowy'' contains a semicircular protuberance in the middle. A line with an angular protuberance in the middle, like a battlement, is called ''escartelly''.&lt;ref name="line" /&gt;

The arms of Laerskool Bosveld in South Africa have a field ''Per chevron embowed trefly, Azure and Argent''.

The arms of Léopold-Henri Amyot [http://www.heraldry.ca/arms/a/amyot.htm] show "per fess ogivy"; this is based on the [[ogive]] or [[pointed arch]].

Chiefs, fesses and palar dividing lines are sometimes seen ''arched'' and ''double-arched'' (and there is an example of triple-arched), though there is some debate as to whether or not these are lines of partition.  That arched can be combined with partition lines can be seen from the [http://www.ngw.nl/int/gbr/scot/slanks.htm arms] of [[South Lanarkshire]] in [[Scotland]].  Arched can also be ''reversed''.

== Rarer lines and recent inventions ==
[[File:Kainuu.vaakuna.svg|thumb|150px|Fir-tree topped line (''kuusikoro'') in [[Kainuu]] coat of arms.]]
The rare line ''bevilled'' modifies the bendlets in [https://web.archive.org/web/20040409072740/http://www.whitelionsociety.org.uk/Slidesandblazon/WLS%20Armorial/Slide94.GIF the arms of Thomas Roy Barnes] and the pairle in the arms of [[Rovaniemi]], Finland.  This lightning-bolt type of line with one zigzag is to be distinguished from ''angled'', in which the line takes a 90-degree upwards turn before another 90-degree turn, continuing parallel and in the same direction from the old line.  There is a South African example of ''bevilled to sinister'', and a bend ''double bevilled'' can be seen in the arms of Philip Kushlick School.

A line ''trefly'' shows protuberances in the form of trefoils.

The arms of St. Paul's Cathedral in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] contain a bordure ''its inner line looping in foils of poplar of the field within the bordure at each angle and at regular intervals between''.[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090908173201/http://www.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=582&amp;ProjectElementID=2051]

The arms of Carmichael show a fess "wreathy," which may or may not be strictly speaking a line of partition, but it does modify the fess; the coat is not blazoned as a "wreath in fess".  James Parker calls this "tortilly."

The 20th century saw some innovations in lines of partition.  ''Erablé'', a series of alternating upside-down and rightside-up maple-leaves, is a typically [[Canada|Canadian]] line of partition, though the [[College of Arms]] in London has used it in a few grants (but compare the cross ''nowy erablé'' in the arms of Katherina Fahlman Selinger Schaaf.[http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=569]  A [[Finland|Finnish]] line of partition, invented by Kaj Cajander and called ''kuusikoro,'' which is called ''fir-tree topped'' in Britain, and which the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] coined the term ''sapiné'' to blazon, resembles fir trees; in the arms of [[Guy Selvester]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20040830105936/http://www.theheraldrysociety.com/resources/guyselvester.htm] this is called ''sapinage''.  A line resembling fir twigs, and so called in British blazon, is called ''sapinagy'' in Canada (though sadly there is no example of it in the online Canadian Public Register), and ''havukoro'' in Finland.[http://www.baronage.co.uk/2002d/appleton.pdf])  Other 20th-century examples of lines, or things akin to lines, include the 1990 grant to [[Albersdorf-Prebuch]], also in Austria, in which the upper line of the fess takes the form of [[fruit]], the bottom of [[vine-leaves]].  (It is debatable what the distinction is between such lines, and examples such as the [http://www.ngw.nl/int/oos/b/bierbaum.htm arms] of [[Bierbaum am Auersbach]], a town in [[Styria]], in which three pears grow from a [[pall (heraldry)|pall]].)

The South African [[Bureau of Heraldry]] has developed the line of partition ''serpentine''(which has also been called 'ondoyant'), which is rather like wavy, but with only one "wave", one complete cycle of a sine wave; the serpentine in the arms of the Mtubatuba Primary School is defined as "dexter to chief and sinister to base".  (Similar is the German "im Schlangenschnitt" (snake-wise).)  It has also developed the uniquely South-African lines of division (which can also form the ends of a charge) ''nowy of a Cape Town gable'' (now called just ''nowy gabled''),[http://www.baronage.co.uk/2002d/appleton.pdf] and ''nowy of an Indian cupola.'' Similarly, the fess line in the arms of the Council for Social and Associated Workers is ''nowy of a trimount inverted'', the fess in the arms of Mossel Bay is ''nowy of two Karoo gable houses'', the chief in the arms of the Lenasia South-East Management Committee is ''nowy of an Indian cupola'', the chief in the arms of the Genealogical Society of South Africa is ''double nowy gably'' and that of Frederick Brownell is ''gably of three''.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708091949/http://sahw.bravehost.com/h-who.htm]  The arms of the Reyneke Bond (i.e. Reyneke Family Association) are ''Per fess, in each flank double nowy fitchy to base, Azure and Or, a lion rampant per fess of the second and Gules, a chief Or''.  The plain chief identifies these as the arms of a family association.  The arms of Itsokolele, South Africa include ''a chief double fitchy inverted''.

''Broad fitchy couped'' is a line of South-African origin similar in appearance to a mine-dump or escartelly with sloping sides.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708091915/http://sahw.bravehost.com/e-des.htm]

Chevrons can be topped with a fleur-de-lys, and ordinaries with non-straight edges (particularly if they are dancetty or engrailed) can have the points topped with demi fleurs-de-lys.  It has sometimes been said that in some reference works flory-counter-flory (and flory) is treated like a line of partition, even though strictly speaking it is not – though it has been used for centuries that way in the royal arms of Scotland blazoning the double tressure (Public Register of Arms, Lyon Court, Edinburgh) and used by the College of arms in blazoning coats like that of Sutherland of Dunstanburgh Castle (Gules, a chevron flory-counterflory between in chief three mullets and in base a lymphad all or) and is used by the South African Bureau of Heraldry blazoning the coat of Huis Tankotie of the University of Pretoria (Per fess, flory counter-flory, Argent and Azure, in base within the flower an annulet Sable;  a  bordure counterchanged)and Emmanuel-Opleidingsentrum in the South African Bureau of Heraldry's online database. (Flory is sometimes varied with other shapes than the fleur-de-lys, when it is blazoned as ''flory of''.[https://web.archive.org/web/20041227071419/http://www.theheraldrysociety.com/resources/michaelmctiernan.htm])

A vague and unhelpful blazon of the 27th Air Division of the [[United States Air Force]][https://web.archive.org/web/20121024010340/http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=10080] provides for a "bordure of distinctive outline".

'''Linguistic reconstruction''' is the practice of establishing the features of an [[Attested language|unattested]] ancestor language of one or more given languages. There are two kinds of reconstruction:

* '''[[Internal reconstruction]]''' uses irregularities in a single language to make inferences about an earlier stage of that language – that is, it is based on evidence from that language alone.
* '''[[Comparative method (linguistics)|Comparative reconstruction]]''', usually referred to just as '''reconstruction''', establishes features of the ancestor of two or more related languages, belonging to the same [[language family]], by means of the [[comparative method]]. A language reconstructed in this way is often referred to as a [[proto-language]] (the common ancestor of all the languages in a given family); examples include [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], [[Proto-Dravidian language|Proto-Dravidian]].

Texts discussing linguistic reconstruction commonly preface reconstructed forms with an [[asterisk]] (*) to distinguish them from attested forms.

{{anchor|reflex}}An attested word from which a [[Root (linguistics) | root]] in the proto-language is reconstructed is a '''reflex'''. More generally, a reflex is the known derivative of an earlier form, which may be either attested or reconstructed.  Reflexes of the same source are [[cognate]]s.

==Methods==
First, languages that are thought to have arisen from a common proto-language must meet certain criteria in order to be grouped together; this is a process called '''subgrouping'''. Since this grouping is based purely on linguistics, manuscripts and other historical documentation should be analyzed to accomplish this step. However, the assumption that the delineations of linguistics always align with those of culture and ethnicity must not be made. One of the criteria that the grouped languages   usually exemplify '''shared innovation'''. This means that the languages must show common changes made throughout history. In addition, most grouped languages have '''shared retention'''. This is similar to the first criterion, but instead of changes, they are features that have stayed the same in both languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RlU-nGcDrw4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Linguistic Reconstruction: An Introduction to Theory and Method|last=Fox|first=Anthony|date=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198700012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because linguistics, as in other scientific areas, seeks to reflect simplicity, an important principle in the linguistic reconstruction process is to generate the least possible number of phonemes that correspond to available data. This principle is again reflected when choosing the sound quality of phonemes, as the one which results in the fewest changes (with respect to the data) is preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/746925995|title=Historical linguistics 1995 : selected papers from the 12th International Conference on Historical Linguistics, Manchester, August 1995.|date=1998–2000|publisher=John Benjamins|others=Smith, John Charles, 1950-, Bentley, Delia., Hogg, Richard M., Bergen, Linda van.|isbn=9027236666|location=Amsterdam|oclc=746925995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arizona and Oregon are marked in yellow to designate that they have had proposed state horse breeds.]]
Twelve U.S. states have designated a [[horse breed]] as the official '''state horse'''. The first state horse was designated in Vermont in 1961. The most recent state designations occurred in 2010, when [[North Carolina]] and [[South Carolina]] both declared state breeds. There have been proposals to designate a state horse in [[Oregon]] as well as in [[Arizona]] (where an ongoing campaign sought to designate the [[Colonial Spanish Horse]] as the state horse prior to the state centennial in 2012), but neither proposal is yet successful.&lt;ref name=Arizona&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arizonahorseproject.com/About.htm|title=About Us|publisher=Arizona Colonial Spanish Horse Project|accessdate=February 10, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707161826/http://www.arizonahorseproject.com/About.htm|archivedate=July 7, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one state, [[North Dakota]], the state horse is officially designated the "'''honorary state equine'''."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nd.gov/content.htm?parentCatID=75&amp;id=State%20Equine North Dakota State Equine]," State of North Dakota.&lt;/ref&gt; Two additional states have not designated a specific state horse, but have designed a horse or horse breed as its official [[List of U.S. state animals|state animals]]: the horse in [[New Jersey]] and the [[Morgan horse|Morgan]] horse breed in [[Vermont]].

Some breeds, such as the [[American Quarter Horse]] in [[Texas]] and the Morgan horse in Vermont and [[Massachusetts]], were named as the state horse because of the close connection between the history of the breed and the state. Others, including the [[Tennessee Walking Horse]] and the [[Missouri Fox Trotter]], include the state in the official breed name. School children have been persuasive lobbyists for the cause of some state horses, such as the [[Colonial Spanish Horse]] being named the state horse of North Carolina due to the presence of the Spanish-descended [[Banker horse]]s in the [[Outer Banks]],&lt;ref name=NC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvec.com/news/local/NC-okays-Outer-Banks-wild-horses-as-state-horse-95446659.html|title=NC okays Outer Banks mustangs as state horse|date=June 2, 2010|accessdate=March 19, 2011|publisher=WVEC Television, Inc|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605233722/http://www.wvec.com/news/local/NC-okays-Outer-Banks-wild-horses-as-state-horse-95446659.html|archivedate=June 5, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have been brought to official status through the lobbying efforts of their [[breed registry|breed registries]].

Official state horses are one of many [[Lists of United States state insignia|state symbols]] officially designated by states. Each state has its own [[Flags of the U.S. states|flag]] and [[Seals of the U.S. states|state seal]], and many states also designate other symbols, including animals, plants, and foods. Such items usually are designated because of their ties to the culture or history of that particular state. In addition to being state symbols in their own right, horses have also appeared in state symbols; for example, a horse's head appears on the [[Seal of New Jersey]].

This is a '''list of hazing deaths in the Philippines'''. This is not an exhaustive list. Inclusion in this list requires that the incident was described by the media as a hazing-related death. Majority of deaths in this list include but is not limited to cases that involve [[fraternities]].

The first reported hazing death in the Philippines was that of Gonzalo Mariano Albert, a [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] student and a [[Upsilon Sigma Phi]] neophyte. He died in 1954.

The death of Leonardo Villa in 1991 led to the passage of the [[Anti-Hazing Act of 1995]].&lt;ref name="scpunishes"/&gt;

{{confuse|Mucuna}}
The '''Macuna''' are a [[Tucanoan languages|Tucanoan-speaking]] group of the eastern part of the [[Amazon basin]], located around the confluence of the [[Pira Paraná River]] and [[Apaporis]] river, in the [[Colombia]]n [[Vaupés Department]] and the [[Brazil]]ian state of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]]. There are no reliable census data for the Macuna. The entire population was estimated at some 600 individuals in 1991 (compared with 400 in 1973), of which 450 lived in [[Colombia]]. 

Except of spoken accounts of a violent past with the southern neighbors, especially the [[Yauna (people)|Yauna]] and [[Tanimuka]] Indians, little is known about the early history of the Macuna. Their first mention are in the Portuguese accounts of the 18th century; as the commercial exploitation of rubber began in the Colombian Amazon in the late 19th century, contact with outsiders occurred more frequently, and with a negative effect. Men were taken away with force to work for the rubber patrons, a situation that lasted into the 1940s. The first Catholic mission was established in the area in the 1960s, though intermittent contact with missionaries has existed at least since the 18th century. 

The late 1970s and early 1980s brought a new boom into the region, with the growing of [[coca]] leaves for illegal trade, which brought substantial quantities of trade goods and money for the indigenous people who working for the White patrons established in the area. By the mid-1980s the production of coca leaves ended as abruptly as it began, but shortly after gold has been discovered along the [[Taraira River]], just a few days away from the Macuna territory. Thousands of White gold miners entered the territory, a majority through Macuna lands, a situation which the Macuna used as a new source of trade goods and money. Additionally, many young men of the group go to the gold fields for a few weeks or months to look for gold on their own or under the temporary employment of a White patron.

Despite this, the Macuna essentially subsist on [[swidden]]-cultivation, [[hunting]], [[fishing]], and gathering of forest products. The staple is [[manioc]], but plantains, sweet potatoes, bananas and sugarcane are also cultivated. Meat comes from game such as [[pacas]], [[tapir]], [[peccaries]], large birds, [[monkeys]] and [[caimans]]. The fur trade, especially the skins of [[jaguars]], [[ocelots]], and [[otters]] played an important role in the Macuna economy, until it was prohibited in the 1970s.   

In the 1990s the Colombian government created two Indian reservation encompassing most of the Macuna land, which provided them with enhanced control over their territory.

'''''Ode to the Death of Jazz''''' is an album by  Finnish avant-garde jazz composer, bandleader and drummer [[Edward Vesala]] recorded in 1989 and released on the [[ECM Records|ECM]] label in 1990.&lt;ref name="ECM discography"&gt;[http://www.ecmrecords.com/Catalogue/ECM/1400/1413.php ECM discography] accessed October 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The [[Allmusic]] review by Brian Olewnick awarded the album 2½ stars stating "it feels as though something essential is being restrained, as though Vesala is reluctant to simply let his ensemble surge forward unbound. Fine instrumental work abounds, however, notably by the leader himself on drums and the Garbarek-laden tones of tenor saxophonist Jouni Kannisto. In sum, the listener gets the impression that, although all the elements are in place for a fine album, excessive control has led to a dilution of the power that could have been".&lt;ref name="Allmusic"&gt;Olewnick, B.

A '''paragraphos''' ({{lang-grc|{{linktext|παράγραφος}}}}, ''parágraphos'', from ''para-'', “beside”, and ''graphein'', “to write”) was a mark in [[ancient Greek|ancient]] [[Greek punctuation]], marking a division in a text (as between speakers in a dialogue or drama) or drawing the reader's attention to another division mark, such as the [[two dot punctuation]] mark {{angle bracket|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;[[⁚]]&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}}. There are many variants of this symbol, sometimes supposed to have developed from Greek [[gamma]] ({{lang|grc|Γ}}), the first letter of the word ''graphos''. It was usually placed at the beginning of a line and trailing a little way under or over the text.&lt;ref name=chasejoy&gt;Pearse, Roger.

Cardin is known for his [[avant-garde]] style and his [[Space Age]] designs. He prefers [[geometry|geometric]] shapes and motifs, often ignoring the female form. He advanced into [[unisex]] fashions, sometimes experimental, and not always practical. He founded his fashion house in 1950 and introduced the "bubble dress" in 1954.

He was designated [[UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=8287&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=UNESCO Celebrity Advocates: Pierre Cardin|work=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|accessdate=2 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111121349/http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D8287%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html|archivedate=11 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 October 2009, Cardin was nominated [[FAO Goodwill Ambassador|Goodwill Ambassador]] of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the Goodwill Ambassadors: Pierre Cardin|url=http://www.fao.org/getinvolved/ambassadors/ambassadors/ambassadors-pierrecardin/en/|work=The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardin was born in [[San Biagio di Callalta]] near [[Treviso]]. Cardin’s parents were wealthy landowners, but to escape [[Fascism#Fascist violence, 1922|fascism]] they left Italy and settled in France in 1924.&lt;ref name="Hesse, J. 2010"&gt;Hesse, J. (2010). Pierre Cardin: 60 years of innovation. New York: Assouline.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, a wealthy [[French wine]] merchant, wished him to study architecture, but from childhood he was interested in dressmaking.&lt;ref&gt;http://0-academic.eb.com.library.scad.edu/levels/collegiate/article/Pierre-Cardin/20295&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardin was educated in central France. Beginning his career early, at age 14 he worked as a clothier’s apprentice, learning the basics of fashion design and construction. In 1939, he left home to work for a tailor in [[Vichy]], where he began making suits for women. During [[World War II]], he worked in the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]], launching [[humanitarian]] interests that continue to this day.&lt;ref name=Mid-Century&gt;[http://mid-centuryonline.com/blog/pierre-cardin-biography/ ''Mid-Century Online Magazine'', Pierre Cardin, 6 July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardin moved to Paris in 1945. There, he studied architecture and worked with the fashion house of [[Jeanne Paquin|Paquin]] after World War II. He worked with [[Elsa Schiaparelli]] until he became head of [[Christian Dior]]'s tailleure atelier in 1947, but was denied work at [[Balenciaga]].

Cardin founded his own house in 1950. His career was launched when he designed about 30 of the costumes for "the party of the century", a [[masquerade ball]] at [[Palazzo Labia]] in Venice on 3 September 1951, hosted by the palazzo's owner, [[Carlos de Beistegui]]. He began with [[haute couture]] in 1953.

Cardin was the first couturier to turn to Japan as a [[fashion design|high fashion]] market when he travelled there in 1959.

In 1959, he was expelled from the [[Fédération française de la couture|Chambre Syndicale]] for launching a [[ready-to-wear]] collection for the [[Printemps]] department store as the first [[couturier]] in Paris, but was soon reinstated.
[[File:Pierre Cardin-Sculptures Utilitaires-Cobra Table and Chair.jpg|thumb|upright|Pierre Cardin - Cobra Table and Chair]]

During the 1960s, Cardin began a practice that is now commonplace by creating the system of licences that he was to apply to fashion. A clothing collection launched around this period surprised all by displaying the designer’s logo on the garments for the first time.&lt;ref name=Mid-Century/&gt;

As haute couture began to decline, ready-to-wear soared as well as Cardin's designs. He was the first to combine the "mini" and the "maxi" skirts of the 1970s. He introduced a new hemline that had long pom-pom panels or fringe that swayed as the body moved.&lt;ref name="Hesse, J. 2010"/&gt;

Beginning in the 1970s, Cardin set another new trend: "mod chic". This trend holds true for form or for a combination of forms, which did not exist at the time. He was the first to combine extremely short and ankle length pieces. He made dresses with slits and batwing sleeves with dimensions, and mixed circular movement and gypsy skirts with structured tops. These creations allowed for the geometric shapes that captivated him to be contrasted, with both circular and straight lines. Cardin was an icon for starting this popular fashion movement of the early seventies.&lt;ref name="Längle, E. 2005"&gt;Längle, E. (2005). Pierre Cardin: fifty years of fashion and design. London: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardin was fascinated with adventure. &lt;!-- (Commenting this out because... he went to space? What? Googling did not clear this up. If you can clarify wtf this means, please do. Thanks.)  so in 1970 he paid a visit to the [[NASA]] (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Space Station.--&gt; Enthralled with the idea of putting a man on the moon, Cardin is the only man in history to have tried on the original space suit worn by the first human to set foot on the moon, Neil Armstrong. Cardin loved the space suit so much, he created his own design for NASA in 1970.&lt;ref name="Längle, E. 2005"/&gt;

Cardin resigned from the Chambre Syndicale in 1966 and began showing his collections in his own venue, the "Espace Cardin" (opened 1971) in Paris, formerly the "Théâtre des Ambassadeurs", near the [[U.S. Embassy, Paris|Embassy of the United States in Paris]]. The Espace Cardin is also used to promote new artistic talents, like theater ensembles, musicians, and others. He was also contacted by [[Pakistan International Airlines]] to design uniforms for the flag carrier. The uniforms were introduced in 1966 to 1971 and became an instant hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.dawn.com/weekly/dmag/archive/030504/dmag7.htm |title=Pierre Cardin comes to PIA |journal=Dawn Magazine |first=Omar |last=Kureishi |date=4 May 2003 |accessdate=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Cardin redesigned the [[Barong Tagalog]], a national costume of [[the Philippines]], by opening the front, removing the cuffs that needed [[cufflink]]s, flaring the sleeves, and minimizing the embroidery.  It was also tapered to the body, in contrast with the traditional loose-fitting design and it also had a thicker collar with sharp and pointed cuffs. A straight-cut design was favored by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBdpE-aUchkC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=pierre+cardin+ferdinand+marcos |title=The Politics of Dress in Asia and the Americas |page=31 |editor-last=Edwards |editor-first=Louise |editor2-last=Roces |editor2-first=Mina |publisher=Sussex Academic Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-84519-399-7 |accessdate=2 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 Cardin opened his first furniture boutique on rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honore. His furniture designs were highly inspired by his fashion designs.&lt;ref name="Hesse, J. 2010"/&gt;

In both 1977 and 1979 he was awarded the Cartier Golden Thimble by French haute couture for most creative collection of the season.&lt;ref name="Längle, E. 2005"/&gt;

He was a member of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture et du Prêt-à-Porter from 1953 to 1993.

Like many other designers today, Cardin decided in 1994 to show his collection only to a small circle of selected clients and journalists. After a break of 15 years, he showed a new collection to a group of 150 journalists at his bubble home in Cannes.

==Brand==
Pierre Cardin used his name as a brand, initially a prestigious fashion brand, then in the 1960s expanded successfully into perfumes and cosmetics. From about 1988 the brand was [[License#Trademark and brand licensing|licensed]] extensively, and appeared on "wildly nonadjacent products such as baseball caps and cigarettes". A 2005 article in the Harvard Business Review commented that the extension into perfumes and cosmetics was successful as the premium nature of the Pierre Cardin brand transferred well into these new, adjacent categories, but that the owners of the brand mistakenly attributed this to the brand's strength rather than to its fit with the new product categories. The extensive licensing eroded the brand's credibility, but brought in much revenue; in 1986 ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'' (WWD) estimated Cardin’s annual income at over [[US$]]10 million. 1995 quotes from WWD included "Pierre Cardin—he has sold his name for toilet paper. At what point do you lose your identity?" and "Cardin’s cachet crashed when his name appeared on everything from key chains to pencil holders". However, the Cardin name was still very profitable, although the indiscriminate licensing approach was considered a failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/2005/12/how-not-to-extend-your-luxury-brand |title=How Not to Extend Your Luxury Brand |website=Harvard Business Review|date=December 2005|author=Mergen Reddy and Nic Terblanche|accessdate= 6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=licensingking&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highsnobiety.com/2015/11/23/digging-deeper-pierre-cardin/ |title=Digging Deeper - Pierre Cardin's Demise to "Licensing King"|website=Highsnobiety.com  |author=Jason Dike|date=23 November 2015|accessdate= 6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Cardin tried to sell his business, valuing it at €1 billion, although the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' considered it to be worth about a fifth of that amount. Ultimately he did not sell the brand.&lt;ref name=licensingking/&gt;

[[File:1972 AMC Javelin with Pierre Cardin interior.JPG|thumb|right|Cardin interior in a 1972 [[AMC Javelin]]]]

[[File:Pierre Cardin 1978.JPG|thumb|left|Cardin signing his new executive jet design (1978)]]
Continuously fascinated by geometric shapes, in 1975, Cardin applied his fetish for the bubble to a monumental domestic work which would become the [[Palais Bulles]] (the Bubble House), along with the help of architect [[Antti Lovag]]. Cardin furnished the Bubble House with his original creations. The curves of the Bubble House extend over 1,200 square metres and contain ten bedrooms decorated by contemporary artists, as well as a panoramic living room.&lt;ref name=Mid-Century/&gt;

Cardin bought [[Maxim's Paris|Maxim's restaurants]] in 1981 and soon opened branches in New York, London, and Beijing (1983). A chain of [[Maxim's Paris|Maxim's Hotels]] (Palm Springs, California, 1986) are now included in the assets. He has also licensed a wide range of food products under that name.

During the 1980s and until the mid-1990s, he supported a French Press organization for [[Music-hall]], [[Circus]], [[Dance]] and [[Arts]] presided by a well known journalist in France, [[:fr:Jacqueline Cartier|Jacqueline Cartier]], with authors or notable personalities as [[Guy des Cars]], [[:fr:Francis Fehr|Francis Fehr]], [[Yves Mourousi]] and [[Jean-Pierre Thiollet]].

In 2001, Cardin purchased the ruins of the castle in [[Lacoste, Vaucluse]] that was once inhabited by the [[Marquis de Sade]]; he has partially renovated the site and holds music or dance festivals (particularly with [[Marie-Claude Pietragalla]]) there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lichfield |first=John |title=Does Lacoste want the grand designs of Pierre Cardin?

Cardin also owns a palazzo in [[Venice]] named Ca' Bragadin. Although he has claimed in several interviews that this house was once owned by [[Giacomo Casanova]], in reality it was the home of Giovanni Bragadin di San Cassian, Bishop of Verona and Patriarch of Venice.

{{postmodernism}}
'''Postmodernism in political science''' refers to the use of [[postmodern]] ideas in [[political science]].
Postmodernists believe that many situations which are considered political in nature can not be adequately discussed in traditional [[Realism in international relations|realist]] and [[liberalism|liberal]] approaches to [[political science]].  Postmodernists cite examples such as the situation of a Benedictine University “draft-age youth whose identity is claimed in national narratives of ‘national security’ and the universalizing narratives of the ‘rights of man,’” of “the woman whose very womb is claimed by the irresolvable contesting narratives of ‘church,’ ‘paternity,’ ‘economy,’ and ‘liberal polity.’&lt;ref&gt;Richard K. Ashley and R. B. J. Walker, "Introduction: Speaking the Language of Exile: Dissident Thought in International Studies" in ''International Studies Quarterly'', Vol. 34, No. 3 (Sep., 1990), pp. 259-268&lt;/ref&gt;  In these cases, postmodernists argue that there are no fixed categories, stable sets of values, or common sense meanings to be understood in their scholarly exploration.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In these margins, postmodernists believe that people resist realist concepts of power which is repressive, in order to maintain a claim on their own identity.  What makes this resistance significant is that among the aspects of power resisted is that which forces individuals to take a single identity or to be subject to a particular interpretation.  Meaning and interpretation in these types of situations is always uncertain; arbitrary in fact.  The [[Power (sociology)|power]] in effect here is not that of [[oppression]], but that of the [[culture|cultural]] and social implications around them, which creates the framework within which they see themselves, which creates the boundaries of their possible courses of action.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Postmodern political scientists, such as [[Richard K. Ashley|Richard Ashley]], claim that in these marginal sites it is impossible to construct a coherent [[narrative]], or story, about what is really taking place without including contesting and contradicting narratives, and still have a “true” story from the perspective of a “sovereign subject,” who can dictate the values pertinent to the “meaning” of the situation.  In fact, it is possible here to [[Deconstruction|deconstruct]] the idea of meaning. Ashley attempts to reveal the ambiguity of texts, especially Western texts, how the texts themselves can be seen as "sites of conflict" within a given culture or [[worldview]].  By regarding them in this way, deconstructive readings attempt to uncover evidence of ancient cultural biases, conflicts, lies, tyrannies, and power structures, such as the tensions and ambiguity between [[peace]] and [[war]], [[lord]] and [[Slavery|subject]], [[male]] and [[female]], which serve as further examples of [[Derrida]]'s binary oppositions in which the first element is privileged, or considered prior to and more authentic, in relation to the second.  Examples of postmodern political scientists include post-colonial writers such as [[Frantz Fanon]], [[feminism|feminist]] writers such as [[Cynthia Enloe]], and [[Postpositivism|postpositive]] theorists such as Ashley and [[James Der Derian]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

'''Precisionism''' was the first indigenous [[modern art]] movement in the [[United States]] and an early American contribution to the rise of [[Modernism]].  The Precisionist style, which first emerged after [[World War I]] and was at the height of its popularity during the 1920s and early 1930s, celebrated the new American landscape of [[skyscraper]]s, bridges, and factories in a form that has also been called "Cubist-Realism."&lt;ref&gt;Milton Brown, ''American Painting from the Armory Show to the Depression'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1955), p. 114-115.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "Precisionism" was first coined in the mid-1920s, possibly by [[Museum of Modern Art]] director Alfred H. Barr.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Stavitsky, ''Precisionism in America, 1915-1941: Reordering Reality'' (New York: Abrams, 1994), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Painters working in this style were also known as the "Immaculates," which was the more commonly used term at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Stavitsky, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The stiffness of both art-historical labels suggests the difficulties contemporary critics had in attempting to characterize these artists.

== An American movement ==
[[File:NY Met demuth figure 5 gold.JPG|thumb|left|[[Charles Demuth]], ''[[I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold]]'', 1928, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]

Influenced by [[Cubism]] and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]], Precisionism took for its main themes [[industrialisation]] and the modernization of the American landscape, the structures of which were depicted in precise, sharply defined geometrical forms. Precisionist artists considered themselves strictly American and some were reluctant to acknowledge their European artistic influences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/prec/hd_prec.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet it was readily apparent at the time that the fracturing of planes in many Precisionist paintings originates in the Cubism of [[Picasso]] and [[Léger]]; similarly, Precisionist renderings of shafts of light as rigidly drawn "lines of force" is a clear borrowing from Futurism. In the end, Precisionism was less about pure originality of expression and more about an energetic American use and amalgamation of certain European modernist techniques. Part of precisionism's originality is found in its subject matter and outlook.

There is a degree of reverence for the industrial age in the movement, but social commentary was not fundamental to the style. Like [[Pop Art]], Precisionism has on occasion been interpreted as a criticism of the de-natured society it portrays, though its artists did not often feel comfortable with this reading of their work. [[Elsie Driggs]]' ''Pittsburgh'' (1926) illustrates this gap in perception.&lt;ref&gt;For a fuller discussion of ''Pittsburgh'', see Constance Kimmerle, ''Elsie Driggs: The Quick and the Classical'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008), pp. 31-33 and John Loughery, "Blending the Classical and the Modern: The Art of Elsie Driggs," ''Woman's Art Journal'' (Winter 1987), p 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  A painting of black and gray steel-mill smokestacks, thick piping, and crisscrossing wires, with only clouds of smoke to relieve the severity of the image, viewers have been tempted to see this dark painting as a statement of environmental concern. To the contrary, Driggs always claimed that she intended an ironic beauty in the image and referred to it as "my [[El Greco]]." Upon seeing the painting, Charles Daniel dubbed her "one of the new classicists."&lt;ref&gt;Kimmerle, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; More often than not, Precisionism implicitly celebrated man-made dynamism and new technologies.  Possible exceptions to this statement are some of the darker, more claustrophobic city paintings of [[Louis Lozowick]] and the comic anti-capitalist satires of [[Preston Dickinson]].

As might be expected, varying degrees of abstraction are found in Precisionist works. ''[[I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold|The Figure 5 in Gold]]'' (1928) by [[Charles Demuth]], a clamorous hommage to [[William Carlos Williams]]' imagist poem about a fire truck is abstract and stylized, while the paintings of [[Charles Sheeler]] sometimes verge on a form of [[photorealism]]. (In addition to his meticulously detailed paintings like ''River Rouge Plant'' and ''American Landscape'', Sheeler, like his friend [[Paul Strand]], also created sharp-focus photographs of factories and public buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artfacts.net/index.php/pageType/exhibitionInfo/exhibition/16202 Charles Sheeler photo, retrieved online November 9, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;)  The majority of Precisionist paintings and drawings, however, present no obstacles in identifying their imagery.  Some Precisionist work tended toward a ''"highly controlled approach to technique and form"'' as well as an application of ''"[[hard-edge painting|hard-edged]] style to long-familiar American scenes"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/prec/hd_prec.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; Precisionist artists aimed to convey the geometric and psychological essence of a scene or a structure but intended that essence to be almost immediately accessible.

Most Precisionist imagery is urban: office towers, apartment houses, bridges, tunnels, subway platforms, streets, the skyline and grid of the modern city.  Other artists, however, such as Charles Demuth, Niles Spencer, [[Ralston Crawford]], [[Sanford Ross]], and Charles Sheeler, applied the same approach to more pastoral settings and painted starkly geometric renderings of barns, cottages, country roads, and farm houses.  Artists such as [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and [[Gerald Murphy]] painted Precisionist still lifes as well.

==Precisionists==
[[File:Wall Street by Paul Strand, 1915.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Strand]], ''[[Wall Street (photograph)|Wall Street]],'' 1915]]
Many American artists worked in a Precisionist style over a twenty-year period. [[George Ault]], [[Ralston Crawford]], [[Francis Criss]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Charles Demuth]], [[Preston Dickinson]], [[Elsie Driggs]], [[Louis Lozowick]], [[Gerald Murphy]], [[Charles Sheeler]], [[Niles Spencer]], [[Morton Schamberg]] and [[Joseph Stella]], were among the most prominent Precisionists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04EED81439F932A25751C1A962958260&amp;fta=y The New York Times, Roberta Smith, ''ART VIEW: Precisionism And a Few Of Its Friends," October 26, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of their work can be found in most major American museum collections. [[Dale Nichols]], [[Millard Sheets]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kcet.org/shows/artbound/hilbert-museum-chapman-california-scene-paintings The Hilbert Museum reveals treasures of California Scene Painting, Liz Goldner, February 24, 2016 KCET https://www.kcet.org/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virginia Berresford]], [[Henry Billings]], [[Peter Blume]], [[Stefan Hirsch]], [[Edmund Lewandowski]], [[John Storrs]], [[Miklos Suba]], Sandor Bernath, [[Herman Trunk]], [[Arnold Wiltz]], [[Clarence Holbrook Carter]], Edgar Corbridge and the photographers [[Paul Strand]] and [[Lewis Hine]] were other artists associated with Precisionism. The movement had no major presence outside the United States, although it did influence [[Australian art]] where [[Jeffrey Smart]] adopted its principles. Although no manifesto was ever created, some of the artists were friends and frequently exhibited at the same galleries. [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], especially with paintings like ''New York City with Moon'' (1926) and ''The Shelton With Sun Spots'' (1926), created her own more sensuous version of Precisionism, although her best-known works are not closely related to Precisionism, and it would be inaccurate to state that O'Keeffe (who vehemently resisted movement ties) was closely aligned with the Precisionist movement. Her husband, photographer and art dealer [[Alfred Stieglitz]], was a highly regarded mentor for the group and was especially supportive of Paul Strand.

Precisionist art would have an indirect influence on the later styles known as [[magic realism]], [[pop art]], and [[photorealism]], but it was largely considered a dated "period style" by the 1950s, though its influence on advertising imagery and stage and set design continued throughout the twentieth century. Its two most famous practitioners are Charles Demuth and Charles Sheeler.

[[File:Writing on a grain of rice.jpg|thumb|A person writing on a grain of rice.]]
'''Rice writing''' is the art and skill of being able to write small enough to write on a grain of [[rice]].

==History==
Rice writing originated in Ancient [[Anatolia]] in Turkey and India. Many rituals and rites use rice as a medium, but at some point in ancient [[Anatolia]] artisans who were skilled in making miniature paintings decided to turn their skill to making art with what had always been an ancient symbol of prosperity, the oldest example of which lies in [[Topkapi Palace]] in Istanbul, Turkey. The artisans would inscribe messages or names on a single grain of rice after it was treated and polished. Grains that were long and flat were favorites as they offered proper surfaces for writing. Apart from Turkey, India also had a large number of  artisans skilled in making miniature art including rice art.

==Rice art Symbolism==
Rice art is considered to bring good luck hence some of its most popular forms is good luck pendants, hope bracelets and cell phone charms.

==Rice art and Rice jewelry today==
[[File:Grain of rice necklace-2.jpg|thumb|A necklace containing a grain of rice with the name "Filip" written on it.]]
Within time rice writing and rice art evolved, soon creating rice jewelry where the rice grain was enclosed in a vial with a liquid/oil that magnifies the individual grain making it easier to appreciate the painstaking and intricate details. This went further with rice jewelry like good luck pendants, charm bracelets, anklets and earrings. In modern times most of these artisans and artists set up shop with street side stalls where they can personally write your message or name on a rice grain while displaying their wares and hard work.

==Technique==
Most modern day rice writers use the following tools:  
#Common long grain white rice:  This rice is a flat cylinder shape.  Because it is flat it provides two wide surfaces for writing.
#Sharp utility knife:  This is used to scrape the rice slightly to remove ridges to provide a smooth surface for writing.  This scraping method can also be used to remove minor mistakes. 
#[[Clay]]:  Some people use a utility gripper clay and others use a modeling clay.  The clay is used to hold the rice in place while performing the writing.
#[[Technical pen]]:  This is a drawing pen with an ultra-fine tip.  Most pens used are either size .18 (4x0) or .13 (6x0).  These can be purchased online, or at some arts and crafts stores.
#Waterproof Ink: This ink is sold with the technical pen.

Once the rice writing is complete, it is usually preserved in a small vial of liquid/oil.  Many craftsman mount these vials into [[jewelery]] such as necklaces, bracelets and key chains.

[[Image:Three Donalds.jpg|thumb|[[Taran Killam]] (left) and [[Darrell Hammond]] (right), respectively, portray [[Donald Trump]] while the real Donald Trump (middle) hosted ''Saturday Night Live'' on November 7, 2015]]
{{Donald Trump series}}
The sketch comedy television series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL'') has parodied [[Donald Trump]] since 1988, from his time as a real estate broker, to his popular run as host of ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', and ultimately during [[Presidency of Donald Trump|his presidency]].

To date, Trump has been portrayed by five ''SNL'' performers: [[Phil Hartman]], [[Darrell Hammond]], [[Jason Sudeikis]], [[Taran Killam]], and [[Alec Baldwin]]. Darrell Hammond has portrayed him the longest, originally while in the cast in the late 1990s, and then reprising the role in a series of cameos in 2016. The other cast-members held the role briefly, with five appearances by Hartman, three by Killam, and only one by Sudeikis.&lt;ref name="snlarchives.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snlarchives.net/Impressions/?727|title=SNL Archives - Impressions - Donald Trump|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since October 2016, the role has been played by Alec Baldwin, who has made many appearances on the series through its run.

''SNL'' has frequently paired parodies of Trump with impressions of [[Family of Donald Trump|his wives and children]] or, since he took office, various staff-members. Trump has hosted the show twice, in 2004 and 2015, the latter time as a candidate.

==Hartman parodies (1988–1990)==
Cast member [[Phil Hartman]] was the show's first portrayer of Donald Trump, from 1988 until 1990. Hartman portrayed Trump five times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snlarchives.net/Impressions/?727|title=SNL Archives - Impressions - Donald Trump|publisher=|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was paired with [[Jan Hooks]] as Trump's then-wife [[Ivana Trump]] or, in one case, [[Marla Maples]], Trump's second-wife-to-be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snlarchives.net/Impressions/?727|title=SNL Archives - Impressions - Ivana Trump|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="people.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/article/history-of-donald-trump-on-snl/|title='I'm a Ratings Machine': A History of Donald Trump on SNL|date=3 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first sketch, from December 1988, shows Donald and Ivana celebrating Christmas, giving large, gold and jewel-encrusted presents to each other.&lt;ref name="people.com"/&gt;

Trump is seen in the audience at the ''[[Saturday Night Live 15th Anniversary Special]]'' from 1989, where [[Chevy Chase]] spills popcorn on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/12399-watch-the-donald-trump-sketch-that-was-mysteriously-deleted-from-2004-snl-episode|title=Watch The Donald Trump Sketch That Was Mysteriously Deleted From 2004 SNL Episode|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sketch from February 1990 parodies the Ivana Trump divorce. Ivana demands more money since Donald has been unfaithful, but he refutes this by referring to their extensive [[prenuptial agreement]]. It states, among other things, that he is entitled to have mistresses provided they are younger than she is, and that she will be paid in [[Rai stones|giant stonecoins]].&lt;ref name="people.com"/&gt;

The next episode had Marla Maples and Trump appearing on ''[[The Church Lady|Church Chat]]''. The couple are referred to as a "satanic sandwich", and the sketch shows press coverage of their relationship, including a "Best Sex I've Ever Had" headline.&lt;ref name="people.com"/&gt;

==Hammond parodies (1999–2011, 2015–2016)==
Hartman did not do more Trump-sketches after 1990, and [[Darrell Hammond]]'s first two portrayals came in 1999.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/article/history-of-donald-trump-on-snl/|title='I'm a Ratings Machine': A History of Donald Trump on SNL|date=3 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first sketch had [[Ross Perot]] ([[Cheri Oteri]]) searching for "a new crazy leader" for the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]], with Trump and [[Pat Buchanan]] ([[Chris Parnell]]) as possible candidates. Their meeting is crashed by a violent [[Jesse Ventura]] ([[Will Ferrell]]). In the second sketch Trump announces [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2000|that he is running for president]] and tells the audience, "Eh, don't try to fight it. Alright?" He also introduces his running mate, ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' winner [[John Carpenter (game show contestant)|John Carpenter]].

Hammond resumed playing Trump in 2004, doing so a total of 16 times up to 2011, although he left the cast in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snlarchives.net/Impressions/?1721|title=SNL Archives - Impressions - Donald Trump|publisher=|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parodies focused on Trump's interest and involvement with politics, commercials, and his appearances on [[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|''The Apprentice'']]. Trump [[Saturday Night Live (season 29)#ep561|hosted the show]] in April 2004, praising Hammond in his opening monologue, and appeared in a sketch next to Hammond's Trump.

An early 2005 episode introduced Trump's third wife, [[Melania Trump|Melania]] ([[Paris Hilton]]). Trump brings her home to let his children, [[Eric Trump]] ([[Fred Armisen]]), [[Donald Trump Jr.]] ([[Seth Meyers]]), and [[Ivanka Trump]] ([[Maya Rudolph]]), "meet their new mommy". Melania would be portrayed later by [[Molly Shannon]] and, from 2015 and onward (without Hammond), by [[Cecily Strong]].&lt;ref name="snlarchives.net1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snlarchives.net/Impressions/?3603|title=SNL Archives - Impressions - Melania Trump|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Hammond is the show's longest running Trump impersonator. He played the role for ten years in the cast, 1999 to 2009, and reprised it twice in 2011. In the 2011 sketches Trump involves himself in the upcoming [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012|Republican Party presidential primaries]] and questions [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories#Donald Trump|President Obama's birth certificate]].

After returning to serve as the show's announcer in 2014, he began reprising his role as Trump regularly, beginning in December 2015. Due to the wide field of GOP candidates in the [[2016 U.S. presidential election]], the show needed at least one cameo appearance to cover all of the candidates. Taran Killam, who at this point had begun playing Trump, switched to portraying [[Ted Cruz]]. ''SNL'' had asked alumnus [[Jimmy Fallon]] (who had portrayed Trump on [[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon|his own show]]) to play the part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screencrush.com/snl-donald-trump-jimmy-fallon-darrell-hammond/|title=SNL Wanted Jimmy Fallon to Take Over Trump From Taran Killam|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a last minute change prevented this, Hammond returned to the role. [[Cecily Strong]], who had portrayed Melania opposite Killam's Trump, continued in this role alongside Hammond.&lt;ref name="snlarchives.net1"/&gt;

Hammond subsequently appeared as Trump in seven more episodes of the season. His appearance in the role was critically acclaimed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/01/25/why-snl-can-t-quit-darrell-hammond-its-best-donald-trump-impersonator.html|title=Why 'SNL' Can't Quit Darrell Hammond, Its Best Donald Trump Impersonator|first=Matt|last=Wilstein|date=25 January 2016|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some outlets reported that the role should be moved to a permanent cast member at some point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/tv/beck-bennett-donald-trump-snl/|title=Beck Bennett Should Play Donald Trump When SNL Returns|date=21 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sudeikis parody (2012)==
[[Jason Sudeikis]] appeared in the role once, during a ''[[Fox &amp; Friends]]'' parody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snlarchives.net/Impressions/?3266|title=SNL Archives - Impressions - Donald Trump|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sudeikis' Trump comments on Barack Obama's handling of [[Hurricane Sandy]].

==Killam parodies (2015)==
It was announced prior to the show's forty-first season that [[Taran Killam]] would be taking over the role for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Reportedly, several cast members had auditioned for the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/09/taran-killam-donald-trump-saturday-night-live-nbc-1201537233/|title=Taran Killam To Play Donald Trump On 'Saturday Night Live'|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|date=20 September 2015|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Killam's Trump debuted on the October 2015 sketch "A Message From Donald &amp; Melania Trump", which also introduced Cecily Strong as Melania Trump. The message is sent from "our humble gold house", and Donald presents himself as "the man who's almost certainly your next president". The couple praise Donald's qualities as a person and a politician, although he becomes uncomfortable when she claims that he [[Political positions of Donald Trump#In his own words|"was democrat before he was republican"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snlarchives.net/Episodes/?201510031|title=SNL Archives - Episodes - 10.03.2015 #1|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duo reprised the setup and characters in December, wishing viewers a Merry Christmas and presenting a "Naughty and Nice" list. Donald placed Santa on the "naughty" list since he doesn't trust anybody who can fly over a wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snlarchives.net/Episodes/?201512051|title=SNL Archives - Episodes - 12.05.2015 #1|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Trump [[Saturday Night Live (season 41)#ep791|hosted ''SNL'' a second time]] in November 2015, and Killam and Hammond appeared during the opening monologue alongside him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snlarchives.net/Episodes/?201511072|title=SNL Archives - Episodes - 11.07.2015 #2|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Trump was running for president, his appearance triggered the [[equal-time rule]], so his opponents received free air time on NBC affiliate stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/20/media/donald-trump-snl-equal-time/index.html|title=Donald Trump says 'SNL' was 'biased' and asks for 'equal time for us'|first=Frank|last=Pallotta|date=20 November 2016|publisher=|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Trump appeared in a sketch portraying him as an incredibly successful president in 2018. Cecily Strong parodied Melania, and Trump's daughter Ivanka appeared in a cameo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcdfw.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/Saturday-Night-Live-Trumps-The-Donald-343030352.html|title='Saturday Night Live' Trumps 'The Donald'|publisher=|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump ends the sketch by telling the audience that his ''actual'' presidency would be even better. Trump is one of 17 presidential candidates who have appeared on Saturday Night Live, and the only American President to have hosted the show.&lt;ref&gt;Serico, Chris. Star-spangled laughter: 17 presidential candidates who appeared on 'SNL'. TODAY. 6 November 2015. Web. &lt;http://www.today.com/popculture/star-spangled-laughter-17-presidential-candidates-who-appeared-snl-t54106&gt; Retrieved 26 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Killam later expressed regret and shame for what he referred to as "normalizing" Trump's candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Sam.  [https://www.npr.org/2017/10/17/558160262/taran-killam-says-there-was-never-any-common-ground-when-trump-hosted-snl "Taran Killam Says 'There Was Never Any Common Ground' When Trump Hosted 'SNL.'"] ''NPR''.  17 October 2017.  17 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the December 19, 2015 episode (co-hosted by [[Tina Fey]] and [[Amy Poehler]]), ''SNL'' lacked enough cast members to portray all of the GOP candidates in a debate sketch. As a result, [[Jimmy Fallon]] was asked to return in the role of Trump (which he had played many times on ''The Tonight Show'') so that Killam could portray [[Ted Cruz]] instead. Ultimately, that plan fell through at the last minute, and instead, Hammond played Trump in the debate.

Hammond continued to play Trump for the remainder of the season. Killam's contract was terminated early after that season, with some news sources alleging that being replaced as Trump was part of the reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/08/why-saturday-night-live-shook-things-up/495104/|title=Why Taran Killam and Jay Pharoah are Leaving 'Saturday Night Live'|first=David|last=Sims|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baldwin parodies (2016–present)==
In September 2016, ''SNL'' announced that [[Alec Baldwin]] would replace Hammond in portraying Trump in its parodies of the [[2016 presidential debates]]. Hammond had not expected this, and was very shaken by the replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/style/2017/09/27/darrell-hammond-was-snls-best-donald-trump-and-its-best-impressionist-ever-so-what-went-wrong/|title=Darrell Hammond was SNL's best Donald Trump – and its best impressionist ever.

===Before election===

Baldwin's Trump debuted in the October 1, 2016 episode, opposite [[Kate McKinnon]] as [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Michael Che]] as debate moderator [[Lester Holt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/arts/television/snl-premiere-donald-trump-alec-baldwin.html|title='S.N.L.' Begins a New Season With Alec Baldwin as Donald Trump|date=2 October 2016|work=The New York Times|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sketch was based on the [[United States presidential debates, 2016#First presidential debate (Hofstra University)|first presidential debate]] between Clinton and Trump. The episode also included impressions of members of Trump's family in a parody of the game show ''[[Family Feud]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/saturday-night-live-returns-alec-baldwin-donald-trump-article-1.2814204|title='Saturday Night Live' returns with Alec Baldwin as Donald Trump|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further sketches with Baldwin included elements of the other presidential debates, [[United States presidential debates, 2016#vice presidential debate (Longwood University)|the vice presidential debate]], and the [[Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truthdig.com/avbooth/item/saturday_night_live_tackles_vp_debate_donald_trump_sexism_scandal_20161009|title='Saturday Night Live' Tackles the VP Debate and Donald Trump's Sexism Scandal (Video)|date=9 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The October 15 episode featured a parody of the third presidential debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4532596/snl-donald-trump-alec-baldwin-hillary-clinton-debate/|title=Watch Saturday Night Live's Take on the Second Presidential Debate|first=Mahita|last=Gajanan|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Later in the episode, Baldwin and Cecily Strong appeared as Donald and Melania Trump, in a parody of [[Beyoncé]]'s [[Lemonade (Beyoncé album)|''Lemonade'']]. Host [[Emily Blunt]] portrayed [[Ivanka Trump]], and [[Vanessa Bayer]] appeared as Trump's youngest daughter [[Tiffany Trump]].

Trump reacted negatively to this episode on Twitter, saying that Baldwin's portrayal "stinks", and that it was "time to retire the boring and unfunny show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/16/heres-the-snl-that-finally-went-too-far-for-donald-trump/|title=Here's the SNL sketch that finally went too far for Donald Trump|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet|user=realDonaldTrump|number=787612552654155776|date=16 October 2016|title=Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me.Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After election===

Post-election sketches have included Baldwin's Trump meeting with people such as the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], [[Mitt Romney]], and [[Vladimir Putin]], with humor drawn from the [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|2016 United States election interference by Russia]]. In February, it was reported that the show has had strong viewer ratings since the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/saturday-night-live-ratings-18-49-demo-melissa-mccarthy-1201978637/|title='Saturday Night Live' Flexes Post-Election Ratings Muscle|first=Cynthia|last=Littleton|date=5 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Si-nangsong''' ({{korean|시낭송|詩朗誦}}) refers to the Korean poetry recitation style, which conveys emotions by memorizing poems. 

==History==
In South Korea, it began to be known to the public through a festival called 'Hurrah for the Poets'&lt;ref&gt;올해 첫「詩人(시인)의 날」 11월1일 http://newslibrary.naver.com/viewer/index.nhn?articleId=1987102700329206016&amp;editNo=3&amp;printCount=1&amp;publishDate=1987-10-27&amp;officeId=00032&amp;pageNo=6&amp;printNo=12948&amp;publishType=00020&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;오늘밤'92 시인만세 행사 http://newslibrary.naver.com/viewer/index.nhn?articleId=1992091600289109010&amp;editNo=5&amp;printCount=1&amp;publishDate=1992-09-16&amp;officeId=00028&amp;pageNo=9&amp;printNo=1339&amp;publishType=00010&lt;/ref&gt; in 1967. At that time, many poets participated in the festival, and the poetry recitation contest for the general public was held for the first time. Since then, there have been many poetry recitation contest and groups in South Korea. Even now, there are many contest participating in the competition.

''Si-nangsong-ga'' refers to a Korean [[poetry]] recitation expert. Usually, it is awarded to the winner of the contest.  Currently, the title ''Si-nangsong-ga'', which is certified by the [[Society of Korean Poets]], is awarded only to the winner of the JEI poetry recitation contest.

In South Korea, groups of organizations centering around these ''Si-nangsong-ga'' are conducting poetry recitation activities. Currently, the largest group of ''Si-nangsong-ga'' in South Korea is the Jaeneung Poetry Recitation Association.

The '''Story Workshop''' Method is a method of teaching [[writing]] originated in 1965 by [[John Schultz (writer)|John Schultz]]. The [[Story Workshop Institute]] was founded to bring the method to [[Elementary school|elementary]] and [[Secondary school|secondary]] classrooms and other forums for writing instruction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.storyworkshop.john-schultz.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The former Fiction Writing Department at [[Columbia College Chicago]] used this [[methodology]] in its core writing course progression, and ''[[Hair Trigger]]'' is its award-winning annual of student [[fiction]] and [[creative nonfiction]] writing.

== Main features ==

The Story Workshop method "focuses on helping you hear your own individual voice and provides a supportive, interactive, and challenging environment for developing your reading, writing, listening, speaking, [[critical thinking]], and imaginative [[problem-solving]] capacities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colum.edu/Academics/Fiction_Writing/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310160217/http://www.colum.edu/Academics/Fiction_Writing/index.php |archivedate=2009-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Story Workshop Method differs from [[critique]]-based writing [[pedagogy]] in that it focuses upon developing one's writing process, trusting that a good writing process will lead to good writing. Story Workshop instructors are called "Directors" and they coach students through different parts of the writing process during class, such as:

:published selections with an eye out for elements that may inform their own work, keeping a journal, oral story telling, reading aloud to an audience writing, rewriting, problem-solving (through word games; experiments with form, point-of-view, voice and other elements; coaching and questions), developing a sense of one's own voice, and developing an inner sense for one's [[audience]].

"You can identify the Story Workshop method of teaching writing by its structured, flexible time-period format; by its theory of seeing and voice; by its repertoire of oral word, oral telling, oral reading, writing and recall exercises; by its semicircle format, which heightens and facilitates the group process and the sense of audience; and by its teaching approaches, techniques, strategies, and tactics made possible by the exercises and their many variations. Used in class sessions and in one-to-one tutorial sessions, the Story Workshop method assumes that all forms of writing derive from image and story, from image and movement of voice organizing the expression of perceptions through time. The development of these human perceptual, imaginative, and verbal capacities through their many derivations in oral and written forms is always the Story Workshop objective." From "The Story Workshop Method Writing From Start to Finish," by John Schultz&lt;ref&gt;''College English'' Vol. 39, No. 4, Dec. 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

The Story Workshop pedagogy aims to allow writers to move beyond dependence upon the [[Teacher|instructor]] and the [[classroom]]. With the emphasis upon process development, Story Workshop Methodology sometimes frustrates students who are used to a pedagogical model that features red pen markings on their papers and direct negative [[criticism]] as its primary form of [[feedback]]. When feedback instead comes in coaching from the instructor during activities, in what classmates are able to recall (retell with a full sense of storytelling detail), and questions that the instructor or peers ask—all of which require some [[decision-making]] and responsibility from the writer—such a student will react negatively, claiming that the method "doesn't give any feedback." Successful students develop the ability to internalize various coachings heard in class, to read published [[literature]] with a critical eye and apply the techniques and approaches gleaned to his or her own writing, to use, and, where necessary and appropriate, combine a wide variety of [[prose]] forms and points-of-view in their writing, and to rewrite with a solid sense of what a particular [[manuscript]] needs.

== Measured results ==

The Story Workshop approach has been used on all levels and is modified to meet the needs of each level. In cases that have been tested comprehensively comparing results from classes of several teachers (in a major urban [[community college]] system over fourteen full [[semester]]s) 90% of the Story Workshop trained students passed a rigorous post-test successfully (two hours of argumentative writing), while only 50% to 70% of students from other traditional and ad hoc composition classes in the same college passed the test.&lt;ref&gt;See also quantified results of Story Workshop Composition classes in "My Own Voice: Students Say it Unlocks the Writing Process," by Zoe Keithley, in the ''Journal of Basic Writing'', Vol. II, No. 2, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.storyworkshop.john-schultz.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable writers ==

These writers have taken and instructed Story Workshop classes:
* [[Joe Meno]], winner of the Nelson Algren Award in 2003
* [[Don De Grazia]]
* [[Shawn Shiflett]]
* [[Megan Stielstra]]

'''Techno'''  is a form of [[electronic dance music]] that emerged in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], in the [[United States]] during the mid-to-late 1980s.&lt;ref name="dummymag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dummymag.com/features/the-dummy-guide-to-detroit-techno-the-first-wave|title=The Dummy Guide to Detroit techno part I: origins to explosion &amp;#124; Dummy Mag|publisher=dummymag.com|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/05/27/136655438/get-familiar-with-detroit-techno-10-essential-songs|title=Get Familiar With Detroit Techno: 10 Essential Songs : NPR|publisher=npr.org|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Techno Rebels: The Renegades of Electronic Funk|author1=Sicko, D.|author2=Brewster, B.|date=2010|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=9780814337127|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bCs-wQSG9hYC&amp;pg=PT78|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Butler (2006:33) use of the term EDM "has become increasingly common among fans in recent years. During the 1980s, the most common catchall term for EDM was ''house music'', while ''techno'' became more prevalent during the first half of the 1990s. As EDM has become more diverse, however, these terms have come to refer to specific genres. Another word, ''electronica'', has been widely used in mainstream journalism since 1996, but most fans view this term with suspicion as a marketing label devised by the music industry".&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded use of the word ''techno'' in reference to a specific [[Music genre|genre]] of music was in 1988.&lt;ref name=BREW354&gt;Brewster 2006:354&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=REYNOLDS71&gt;Reynolds 1999:71. ''Detroit's music had hitherto reached British ears as a subset of Chicago house; [Neil] Rushton and the [[Belleville Three]] decided to fasten on the word techno – a term that had been bandied about but never stressed – in order to define Detroit as a distinct genre.''&lt;/ref&gt; Many styles of techno now exist, but [[Detroit techno]] is seen as the foundation upon which a number of sub-genres have been built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Keyboard Magazine|title=Detroit techno |issue=231 |date=July 1995}}&lt;!--volume=21|number=7--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In Detroit, techno resulted from the melding of [[African American music|black styles]] including [[Chicago house]], [[funk]], [[Electro (music)|electro]], and [[Jazz fusion|electric jazz]] with [[electronic music]] by artists such as [[Kraftwerk]], [[Giorgio Moroder]], and [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]].&lt;ref name="bogdanov_2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bogdanov|first=Vladimir|title=All music guide to electronica: the definitive guide to electronic music|year=2001|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation|Backbeat Books]]|isbn=0-87930-628-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GJNXLSBlL7IC&amp;pg=PT582|edition=4|accessdate=May 26, 2011|page=582|quote=Typically, that birth is traced to the early '80s and the emaciated inner-city of Detroit, where figures such as [[Juan Atkins]], [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]], and [[Kevin Saunderson]], among others, fused the quirky machine music of Kraftwerk and Yellow Magic Orchestra with the space-race electric funk of George Clinton, the optimistic futurism of Alvin Toffler's ''The Third Wave'' (from which the music derived its name), and the emerging electro sound elsewhere being explored by Soul Sonic Force, the Jonzun Crew, Man Parrish, "Pretty" Tony Butler, and LA's Wrecking Cru.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Added to this is the influence of [[Futurism (art)|futuristic]] and fictional themes&lt;ref&gt;Rietveld 1998:125&lt;/ref&gt; relevant to life in American [[Late capitalism|late capitalist]] society, with [[Alvin Toffler|Alvin Toffler's]] book ''[[The Third Wave (Toffler book)|The Third Wave]]'' being a notable point of reference.&lt;ref&gt;Sicko 1999:28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Having grown up with the latter-day effects of Fordism, the Detroit techno musicians read futurologist Alvin Toffler's soundbite predictions for change – 'blip culture', 'the intelligent environment', 'the infosphere', 'de-massification of the media de-massifies our minds', 'the techno rebels', 'appropriated technologies' – accorded with some, though not all, of their own intuitions,'' Toop, D. (1995), ''Ocean of Sound'', Serpent's Tail, (p. 215).&lt;/ref&gt; Pioneering [[Record producer|producer]] and DJ [[Juan Atkins]] cites Toffler's phrase "techno rebels" as inspiring him to use the word ''techno'' to describe the musical style he helped to create. This unique blend of influences aligns techno with the [[aesthetic]] referred to as [[afrofuturism]].To producers such as [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]], the transference of spirit from the body to the machine is often a central preoccupation; essentially an expression of technological [[spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;Kodwo 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds 1999:51. ''...techno artists often talk about what they do in the seemingly inappropriate language of traditional humanist art – 'expression', 'soul', 'authenticity', 'depth'.''&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner: "techno dance music defeats what [[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]] saw as the alienating effect of mechanisation on the modern consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;Mc Leod, K.,"Space oddities: aliens, futurism and meaning in popular music", Popular Music (2003) Volume 22/3. Copyright 2003 Cambridge University Press, pp. 337–355.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stylistically, techno is generally repetitive [[instrumental music]], often produced for use in a continuous [[DJ set]]. The central [[Drum beat|rhythmic component]] is most often in [[common time]] (4/4), where time is marked with a [[bass drum]] on each [[quarter note]] pulse, a [[backbeat]] played by [[Snare drum|snare]] or clap on the second and fourth [[Pulse (music)|pulses]] of the [[Bar (music)|bar]], and an open [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] sounding every second [[eighth note]]. The [[tempo]] tends to vary between approximately 120 to 150 [[beats per minute]] (bpm), depending on the style of techno. The creative use of [[Music technology|music production technology]], such as [[drum machines]], [[synthesizer]]s, and [[digital audio workstations]], is viewed as an important aspect of the music's aesthetic. Many [[Record producer|producers]] use [[retro]] electronic musical devices to create what they consider to be an authentic techno sound. Drum machines from the 1980s such as [[Roland Corporation|Roland's]] [[TR-808]] and [[TR-909]] are highly prized, and software emulations of such retro technology are popular among techno producers.

Music journalists and fans of techno are generally selective in their use of the term; so a clear distinction can be made between sometimes related but often qualitatively different styles, such as [[tech house]] and [[Trance music|trance]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141220000949/http://www.musicfaze.com/p/electronica-genre-guide.html#te]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Michael | last=Critzon | title=Eat Static is bad stuff |date=September 17, 2001 | publisher= | url =http://www.cm-life.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&amp;uStory_id=18da0484-aa27-4c21-9e8e-a2abdbb39b94 | archive-url =http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160524013848/http://www.cm-life.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&amp;uStory_id=18da0484-aa27-4c21-9e8e-a2abdbb39b94 | dead-url =yes | archive-date =May 24, 2016 | work =Central Michigan Life | pages = | accessdate = August 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Electronic Energy|journal=The Miami Herald|date=March 23, 2001|first=Michael|last=Hamersly|volume=|issue=|pages=6G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|periodical=Newsweek|date=February 10, 1997|title=Electronic Eden|last=Schoemer|first=Karen|page=60}} ''Every Monday night, Natania goes to Koncrete Jungle, a dance party on new York's lower East Side that plays a hip, relatively new offshoot of dance music known as drum &amp; bass—or, in a more general way, ''techno'', a blanket term that describes music made on computers and electronic gadgets instead of conventional instruments, and performed by deejays instead of old-fashioned bands.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{see also|Detroit techno}}

The initial blueprint for techno developed during the mid-1980s in [[Belleville, Michigan]], a suburb of [[Detroit]] by [[Juan Atkins]], [[Kevin Saunderson]] and [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]] (the so-called [[The Belleville Three]]), all of whom attended school together at [[Belleville High School (Belleville, Michigan)|Belleville High]],&lt;ref&gt;Brewster 2006:340–359&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cosgrove 1988a.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SICKO_UNKNOWN&gt;Sicko 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds 1999:12–40&lt;/ref&gt; with the addition of [[Eddie Fowlkes]], [[Blake Baxter]] and [[James Pennington]]. By the close of the 1980s, the pioneers had recorded and released material under various guises: Atkins as [[Juan Atkins|Model 500]], Flintstones, and Magic Juan; Fowlkes simply as [[Eddie "Flashin" Fowlkes]]; Saunderson as Reeses, Keynotes, and Kaos; with May as Mayday, R-Tyme, and [[Rhythim Is Rhythim]]. There were also a number of joint ventures, &lt;!--the most commercially successful of which{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} was--&gt;including Kevin Saunderson's group [[Inner City (band)|Inner City]], which saw collaborations with Atkins, May, vocalist [[Paris Grey]], and fellow DJs [[James Pennington]] and [Arthur Forest].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/release/39861|title=Release info &amp; credits for Inner City's "Big Fun" original 12" single|publisher=Discogs.com|accessdate=June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Electrifying Mojo]] was the first radio DJ to play music by Atkins, May, and Saunderson. Mojo refused to follow pre-established radio formats or playlists, and he promoted social and cultural awareness of the African American community.

In exploring techno's origins writer [[Kodwo Eshun]] maintains that "[[Kraftwerk]] are to Techno what [[Muddy Waters]] is to the [[Rolling Stones]]: the authentic, the origin, the real."&lt;ref name=KODWO100&gt;Kodwo 1998:100&lt;/ref&gt; Juan Atkins has acknowledged that he had an early enthusiasm for [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Giorgio Moroder]], particularly Moroder's work with [[Donna Summer]] and the producer's own album ''E=MC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.'' Atkins also mentions that "around 1980 I had a tape of nothing but Kraftwerk, [[Telex (band)|Telex]], [[Devo]], Giorgio Moroder and [[Gary Numan]], and I'd ride around in my car playing it."&lt;ref name=MTM/&gt; Atkins has also claimed he was unaware of Kraftwerk's music prior to his collaboration with [[Richard Davis (techno artist)|Richard "3070" Davis]] as [[Cybotron (American band)|Cybotron]], which was two years after he had first started experimenting with electronic instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Sicko 1999:79&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding his initial impression of Kraftwerk, Atkins notes that they were "clean and precise" relative to the "weird UFO sounds" featured in his seemingly "psychedelic" music.&lt;ref&gt;Sicko 1999:71&lt;/ref&gt;

Derrick May identified the influence of Kraftwerk and other European synthesizer music in commenting that "it was just classy and clean, and to us it was beautiful, like outer space. Living around Detroit, there was so little beauty... everything is an ugly mess in Detroit, and so we were attracted to this music. It, like, ignited our imagination!".&lt;ref&gt;Silcott, M.  (1999). ''Rave America: New school dancescapes''. Toronto, ON:  ECW Press.&lt;/ref&gt; May has commented that he considered his music a direct continuation of the European synthesizer tradition.&lt;ref name=BREW349&gt;Brewster 2006:349&lt;/ref&gt; He also identified Japanese synthpop act [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]], particularly member [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]], and British band [[Ultravox]], as influences, along with Kraftwerk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Derrick May on the roots of techno at RBMA Bass Camp Japan 2010|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9t3r3makyc4|work=[[Red Bull Music Academy]]|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=July 23, 2012|date=September 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; YMO's song "[[Solid State Survivor|Technopolis]]" (1979), a tribute to [[Tokyo]] as an electronic mecca, is considered an "interesting contribution" to the development of Detroit techno, foreshadowing concepts that Atkins and Davis would later explore with Cybotron.&lt;ref&gt;Sicko 1999:49&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin Saunderson has also acknowledged the influence of Europe but he claims to have been more inspired by the idea of making music with electronic equipment: "I was more infatuated with the idea that I can do this all myself."&lt;ref name=BREW349/&gt;

===School days===
Prior to achieving notoriety, Atkins, Saunderson, May, and Fowlkes shared common interests as budding musicians, [[DJ mix|"mix"]] tape traders, and aspiring DJs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Techno music pulses in Detroit |date=February 13, 2003 | publisher=CNN | url =http://www.cnn.com/2003/TRAVEL/02/10/techno.exhibit.ap|accessdate = August 11, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012184221/http://cnn.com/2003/TRAVEL/02/10/techno.exhibit.ap &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also found musical inspiration via the ''[[Midnight Funk Association]],'' an eclectic five-hour late-night radio program hosted on various Detroit radio stations, including [[WMKM|WCHB]], [[WGPR]], and WJLB-FM from 1977 through the mid-1980s by DJ Charles "[[The Electrifying Mojo]]" Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.gridface.com/features/a_brief_history_of_techno.html|title=A Brief History of Techno|last=Arnold|first=Jacob|journal=Gridface|date=October 17, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mojo's show featured [[electronic music]] by artists such as [[Giorgio Moroder]], [[Kraftwerk]], [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] and [[Tangerine Dream]], alongside the funk sounds of acts such as [[Parliament Funkadelic]] and dance oriented [[new wave music]] by bands like [[Devo]] and [[the B-52's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Shapiro | first = Peter | title = Modulations: A History of Electronic Music, Throbbing Words on Sound | publisher = Caipirinha Productions, Inc. |year=2000 | pages = 108–121 | isbn = 189102406X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atkins has noted: 

{{quote|He [Mojo] played all the Parliament and [[Funkadelic]] that anybody ever wanted to hear. Those two groups were really big in Detroit at the time. In fact, they were one of the main reasons why [[disco]] didn't really grab hold in Detroit in '79. Mojo used to play a lot of funk just to be different from all the other stations that had gone over to disco. When 'Knee Deep'&lt;ref&gt;Funkadelic's, 1979 release, [http://www.discogs.com/release/653957 ''(Not Just) Knee Deep'']&lt;/ref&gt; came out, that just put the last nail in the coffin of disco music.&lt;ref name=MTM&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mobeus.org/archives/juanatkins/ |date=December 1988 |journal=Music Technology Magazine |title=Future Shock |last=Trask |first=Simon |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315234608/http://www.mobeus.org/archives/juanatkins/ |archivedate=March 15, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite the short-lived disco boom in Detroit, it had the effect of inspiring many individuals to take up mixing, Juan Atkins among them. Subsequently, Atkins taught May how to mix records, and in 1981, "Magic Juan", Derrick "Mayday", in conjunction with three other DJ's, one of whom was Eddie "Flashin" Fowlkes, launched themselves as a party crew called Deep Space Soundworks&lt;ref&gt;Brewster 2006:350&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds 1999:16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; (also referred to as Deep Space).&lt;ref&gt;Sicko 1999:56–58&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 or 1981 they met with Mojo and proposed that they provide mixes for his show, which they did end up doing the following year.&lt;ref name=MTM/&gt;

During the late 1970s-early 1980s high school clubs such as Brats, Charivari, Ciabattino, Comrades, Gables, Hardwear, Rafael, Rumours, Snobs, and Weekends&lt;ref&gt;Snobs, Brats, Ciabattino, Rafael, and Charivari are mentioned in ''Generation Ecstasy'' (Reynolds 1999:15); Gables and Charivari are mentioned in ''Techno Rebels'' (Sicko 1999:35,51–52). Citations still needed for Comrades, Hardwear, Rumours, and Weekends.&lt;/ref&gt; created the incubator in which techno was grown. These young promoters developed and nurtured the local dance music scene by both catering to the tastes of the local audience of young people and by marketing parties with new DJs and their music. As these local clubs grew in popularity, groups of DJs began to band together to market their mixing skills and [[Sound system (DJ)|sound systems]] to the clubs in order to cater to the growing audiences of listeners. Locations like local church activity centers, vacant warehouses, offices, and [[YMCA]] auditoriums were the early locations where underage crowds gathered and the musical form was nurtured and defined.&lt;ref&gt;Sicko 1999:33–42,54–59&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juan Atkins===
{{main|Juan Atkins|Cybotron (American band)}}

Of the four individuals responsible for establishing techno as a genre in its own right, Juan Atkins is widely cited as "The Originator".&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Rebekah Farrugia paraphrasing Derrick May in a review of ''High Tech Soul: The Creation of Techno Music'' (Directed by Gary Bredow. Plexifilm DVD PLX-029, 2006). Published in ''Journal of the Society for American Music'' (2008) Volume 2, Number 2, pp. 291–293.&lt;/ref&gt; Atkins' role was likewise acknowledged in 1995 by the American music technology publication ''[[Keyboard Magazine]]'', which honoured Atkins as one of ''12 Who Count'' in the history of keyboard music.&lt;ref&gt;''Keyboard Magazine'' Vol. 21, No.7 (issue #231, July 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, Atkins began recording with musical partner Richard Davis (and later with a third member, Jon-5) as Cybotron. This trio released a number of rock and electro-inspired tunes,&lt;ref&gt;Sicko 1999:74&lt;/ref&gt; the most successful of which were ''[[Clear (song)|Clear]]'' (1983) and its moodier followup, "Techno City" (1984).&lt;ref&gt;Cosgrove 1988b. ''Juan's first group Cybotron released several records at the height of the electro-funk boom in the early '80s, the most successful being a progressive homage to the city of Detroit, simply entitled 'Techno City'.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sicko 1999:75. ''Adding to the impact of ''Enter'', the single "Clear" made a huge splash and became Cybotron's biggest hit, especially after it was remixed by Jose "Animal" Diaz. "Clear" climbed the charts in Dallas, Houston, and Miami, and spent nine weeks on the Billboard Top Black Singles chart (as it was called then) in fall 1983, peaking at No. 52. "Clear" was a success.''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a recent bio on MySpace, Atkins claims to have "coined the term techno to describe their music, taking as one inspiration the works of [[Futurist]] and author Alvin Toffler, from whom he borrowed the terms 'cybotron' and 'metroplex.' Atkins has used the term to describe earlier bands that made heavy use of synthesizers, such as Kraftwerk, although many people would consider Kraftwerk's music and Juan's early music in Cybotron as electro."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/68657561|title=Juan Atkins official Myspace page|accessdate=April 2, 2008|author=Unknown author}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atkins viewed Cybotron's "Cosmic Cars" (1982) as unique, Germanic, synthesized funk, but he later heard [[Afrika Bambaataa]]'s "[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]" (1982) and considered it to be a superior example of the music he envisioned. Inspired, he resolved to continue experimenting, and he encouraged Saunderson and May to do likewise.&lt;ref&gt;Cosgrove 1988b. ''At the time, [Atkins] believed ["Techno City"] was a unique and adventurous piece of synthesizer funk, more in tune with Germany than the rest of black America, but on a dispiriting visit to New York, Juan heard Afrika Bambaataa's 'Planet Rock' and realized that his vision of a spartan electronic dance sound had been upstaged. He returned to Detroit and renewed his friendship with two younger students from Belleville High, Kevin Saunderson and Derrick May, and quietly over the next few years the three of them became the creative backbone of Detroit Techno.'' "Techno City" was released in 1984. Sicko 1999:73 clarifies Atkins was in New York in 1982, trying to get Cybotron's "Cosmic Cars" into the hands of radio DJs, when he first heard "Planet Rock"; so "Cosmic Cars", not "Techno City", is the ''unique and adventurous piece of synthesizer funk''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, Atkins started producing his own music under the pseudonym [[Juan Atkins|Model 500]], and in 1985 he established the record label [[Metroplex (record label)|Metroplex]].&lt;ref&gt;Sicko 1999:76&lt;/ref&gt; The same year saw an important turning point for the Detroit scene with the release of Model 500's "No UFOs," a seminal work that is generally considered the first techno production.&lt;ref&gt;Sicko 2010:48-49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Butler 2006:43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson 2001:154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"In 1985 Juan Atkins released the first record on his fledgling label Metroplex, 'No UFO's', now widely regarded as Year Zero of the techno movement."'' Cox, T. (2008), [http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature-read.aspx?id=907 Model 500:Remake/remodel], interview with Atkins and Mike Banks hosted on www.residentadvisor.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Detroit producer Alan Oldham hosted at [http://www.spannered.org/music/722/ Spannered.org]. Oldham answers ''"The release of Model 500 No UFOs"'' when asked ''"what do you consider to be the most important turning points in the history of Detroit techno?"''&lt;/ref&gt; Of this time, Atkins has said: 

{{quote|When I started Metroplex around February or March of '85 and released "No UFOs," I thought I was just going to make my money back on it, but I wound up selling between 10,000 and 15,000 copies. I had no idea that my record would happen in Chicago. Derrick's parents had moved there, and he was making regular trips between Detroit and Chicago. So when I came out with 'No UFOs,' he took copies out to Chicago and gave them to some DJs, and it just happened.&lt;ref name=MTM/&gt;}}

The early producers, enabled by the increasing affordability of sequencers and synthesizers, merged a European [[synthpop]] aesthetic with aspects of [[soul music|soul]], [[funk]], [[disco music|disco]], and [[electro music|electro]], pushing electronic dance music into uncharted terrain. They deliberately rejected the [[Motown Records|Motown]] legacy and traditional formulas of [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] and [[soul music|soul]], and instead embraced technological experimentation.&lt;ref name=COSGROVE_ATKINS&gt;Cosgrove 1988a. ''[Says Juan Atkins, ] "Within the last 5 years or so, the Detroit underground has been experimenting with technology, stretching it rather than simply using it. As the price of sequencers and synthesizers has dropped, so the experimentation has become more intense. Basically, we're tired of hearing about being in love or falling out, tired of the R&amp;B system, so a new progressive sound has emerged. We call it techno!"''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=COSGROVE_POSTSOUL&gt;Cosgrove 1988a. ''Although the Detroit dance music has been casually lumped in with the jack virus of Chicago house, the young techno producers of the Seventh City claim to have their own sound, music that goes 'beyond the beat', creating a hybrid of post-punk, funkadelia and electro-disco...a mesmerizing underground of new dance which blends European industrial pop with black American garage funk...If the techno scene worships any gods, they are a pretty deranged deity, according to Derrick May. "The music is just like like Detroit, a complete mistake. It's like George Clinton and Kraftwerk stuck in an elevator." ...And strange as it may seem, the techno scene looked to Europe, to Heaven 17, Depeche Mode and the Human League for its inspiration. ...[Says an Underground Resistance-related group] "Techno is all about simplicity. We don't want to compete with [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]]. Modern R&amp;B has too many rules: big snare sounds, big bass and even bigger studio bills." Techno is probably the first form of contemporary black music which categorically breaks with the old heritage of soul music. Unlike Chicago House, which has a lingering obsession with seventies Philly, and unlike New York Hip Hop with its deconstructive attack on James Brown's back catalogue, Detroit Techno refutes the past. It may have a special place for [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] and [[Pete Shelley]], but it prefers tomorrow's technology to yesterday's heroes. Techno is a post-soul sound...For the young black underground in Detroit, emotion crumbles at the feet of technology. ...Despite Detroit's rich musical history, the young techno stars have little time for the golden era of Motown. Juan Atkins of Model 500 is convinced there is little to be gained from the motor-city legacy... "Say what you like about our music," says Blake Baxter, "but don't call us the new Motown...we're the second coming."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NDSOD_ELEVATOR&gt;Cosgrove 1988b.

One of the first Detroit productions to receive wider attention was Derrick May's "[[Derrick May (musician)#Career|Strings of Life]]" (1987), which, together with May's previous release, "Nude Photo" (1987), helped raise techno's profile in Europe, especially the UK and Germany, during the 1987–1988 [[house music]] boom (see [[Second Summer of Love]]).&lt;ref&gt;Unterberger R., Hicks S., Dempsey J, (1999). ''Music USA: The Rough Guide,'' Rough Guides Ltd; illustrated edition.({{ISBN|9781858284217}})&lt;/ref&gt; It became May's best known track, which, according to Frankie Knuckles, "just exploded.

{{quote|Derrick sold Chicago DJ Frankie Knuckles a TR909 drum machine. This was back when the Powerplant was open in Chicago, but before any of the Chicago DJs were making records. They were all into playing Italian imports; 'No UFOs' was the only U.S.-based independent record that they played. So Frankie Knuckles started using the 909 at his shows at the Powerplant. Boss had just brought out their little sampling footpedal, and somebody took one along there. Somebody was on the mic, and they sampled that and played it over the drumtrack pattern. Having got the drum machine and the sampler, they could make their own tunes to play at parties. One thing just led to another, and Chip E used the 909 to make his own record, and from then on, all these DJs in Chicago borrowed that 909 to come out with their own records.&lt;ref name=MTM/&gt;}}

In the UK, a club following for house music grew steadily from 1985, with interest sustained by scenes in London, Manchester, Nottingham, and later Sheffield and Leeds. The DJs thought to be responsible for house's early UK success include [[Mike Pickering]], [[Mark Moore]], [[Colin Faver]], and [[Graeme Park]].&lt;ref name="Rietveld 1998:40–50"&gt;Rietveld 1998:40–50&lt;/ref&gt;

====Acid house====

[[File:TB-303.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Roland TB-303]]: The [[bass synthesizer|bass line synthesizer]] that was used prominently in [[acid house]].]]

By 1988, house music had exploded in the UK, and [[acid house]] was increasingly popular.&lt;ref name="Rietveld 1998:40–50"/&gt; There was also a long-established warehouse party [[subculture]] based around the [[sound system (Jamaican)|sound system]] scene. In 1988, the music played at warehouse parties was predominantly house. That same year, the [[Balearic beat|Balearic]] party vibe associated with Ibiza-based DJ [[Alfredo Fiorito]] was transported to London, when [[Danny Rampling]] and [[Paul Oakenfold]] opened the clubs Shoom and Spectrum, respectively. Both night spots quickly became synonymous with acid house, and it was during this period that the use of [[MDMA]], as a party drug, started to gain prominence. Other important UK clubs at this time included Back to Basics in [[Leeds]], Sheffield's Leadmill and Music Factory, and in Manchester [[The Haçienda]], where Mike Pickering and Graeme Park's Friday night spot, Nude, was an important proving ground for American [[Underground music|underground]] &lt;ref&gt;Fikentscher (2000:5), in discussing the definition of underground dance music as it relates to post-disco music in America, states that: ''"The prefix 'underground' does not merely serve to explain that the associated type of music - and its cultural context - are familiar only to a small number of informed persons. Underground also points to the sociological function of the music, framing it as one type of music that in order to have meaning and continuity is kept away, to large degree, from mainstream society, mass media, and those empowered to enforce prevalent moral and aesthetic codes and values."'' Fikentscher, K. (2000), ''You Better Work!: Underground Dance Music in New York'', Wesleyan University Press, Hanover, NH.&lt;/ref&gt;  dance music. Acid house party fever escalated in London and Manchester, and it quickly became a cultural phenomenon. MDMA-fueled club goers, faced with 2&amp;nbsp;A.M. closing hours, sought refuge in the warehouse party scene that ran all night. To escape the attention of the press and the authorities, this after-hours activity quickly went underground. Within a year, however, up to 10,000 people at a time were attending the first commercially organized mass parties, called ''raves'', and a media storm ensued.&lt;ref&gt;Rietveld 1998:54–59&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of house and acid house paved the way for wider acceptance of the Detroit sound, and vice versa: techno was initially supported by a handful of house music clubs in Chicago, New York, and Northern England, with London clubs catching up later;&lt;ref&gt;Brewster 2006:398–443&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1987, it was "Strings of Life" which eased London club-goers into acceptance of house, according to DJ Mark Moore.&lt;ref&gt;Brewster 2006:419. ''I was on a mission because most people hated house music and it was all rare groove and hip hop...I'd play Strings of Life at the Mud Club and clear the floor. Three weeks later you could see pockets of people come onto the floor, dancing to it and going crazy – and this was without ecstasy'' – Mark Moore commenting on the initially slow response to House music in 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cosgrove 1988a. ''Although it can now be heard in Detroit's leading clubs, the local area has shown a marked reluctance to get behind the music. It has been in clubs like the Powerplant (Chicago), The World (New York), The Hacienda (Manchester), Rock City (Nottingham) and Downbeat (Leeds) where the techno sound has found most support. Ironically, the only Detroit club which really championed the sound was a peripatetic party night called Visage, which unromantically shared its name with one of Britain's oldest new romantic groups.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The New Dance Sound of Detroit''===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TechnoCover.jpeg|thumb|left|Cover art for the 1988 compilation album, ''Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit'']] --&gt;

The explosion of interest in underground dance music during the late 1980s provided a context for the development of techno as an identifiable [[genre]]. The mid-1988 UK release of ''Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit'',&lt;ref name="Sicko 1999:98"&gt;Sicko 1999:98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="discogs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/release/57919 |title=Various - Techno!

"Because of the way that the media works, dance culture happens very quickly. It's not hard to hype something up. ...When the first techno records came in, the early Model 500, Reese, and Derrick May material, I wanted to follow up the Detroit connection. I took a flyer and called up Transmat; I got Derrick May and we started to release his records in England. ...Derrick came over with a bag of tapes, some of which didn't have any name: tracks which are now classics, like 'Sinister' and 'Strings of Life.' Derrick then introduced us to Kevin Saunderson, and we quickly realized that there was a cohesive sound of these records, and that we could do a really good compilation album. We got backing from Virgin Records and flew to Detroit. We met Derrick, Kevin, and Juan and went out to dinner, trying to think of a name. At the time, everything was house, house house. We thought of Motor City House Music, that kind of thing, but Derrick, Kevin, and Juan kept on using the word ''techno''. They had it in their heads without articulating it; it was already part of their language."''&lt;/ref&gt;

Derrick May views this as one of his busiest times and recalls that it was a period where he 

{{quote|was working with [[Carl Craig]], helping Kevin, helping Juan, trying to put Neil Rushton in the right position to meet everybody, trying to get [[Blake Baxter]] endorsed so that everyone liked him, trying to convince Shake ([[Anthony Shakir]]) that he should be more assertive...and keep making music as well as do the Mayday mix (for the show Street Beat on Detroit's WJLB radio station) and run Transmat records.&lt;ref name="Sicko 1999:98"/&gt;}}

Commercially, the release did not fare as well as expected, and it failed to [[recoupment|recoup]], however Inner City's production "[[Big Fun (Inner City song)|Big Fun]]" (1988), a track that was almost not included on the compilation, became a massive [[crossover music|crossover]] hit in fall 1988.&lt;ref name="Sicko2010_118120" /&gt; The record was also responsible for bringing industry attention to May, Atkins and Saunderson, which led to discussions with [[ZTT]] records about forming a techno [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] called ''Intellex.'' But, when the group were on the verge of finalising their contract, May allegedly refused to agree to [[Top of the Pops]] appearances and negotiations collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;Sicko 2010:71&lt;/ref&gt; According to May, ZTT label boss [[Trevor Horn]] had envisaged that the trio would be marketed as a "black [[Petshop Boys]]." &lt;ref name=FantaziaMay&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantazia.org.uk/DJs/derrickmay.htm|title=DJ Derek May Profile|publisher=Fantazia Rave Archive|accessdate=October 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite [[Virgin Records]]' disappointment with the poor sales of Rushton's compilation,&lt;ref&gt;Sicko 1999:98,101&lt;/ref&gt; the record was successful in establishing an identity for techno and was instrumental in creating a platform in Europe for both the music and its producers.&lt;ref&gt;Sicko 1999:100,102&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the release served to distinguish the Detroit sound from Chicago house and other forms of underground dance music that were emerging during the rave era of the late 1980s and early 1990s, a period during which techno became more adventurous and distinct.&lt;ref name=SICKO95_120&gt;Sicko 1999:95–120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sicko 1999:102. ''Once Rushton and Atkins set techno apart with the ''Techno!'' compilation, the music took off on its own course, no longer parallel to the Windy City's progeny. And as the 1980s came to a close, the difference between techno and house music became increasingly pronounced, with techno's instrumentation growing more and more adventurous.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music Institute===
In mid-1988, developments in the Detroit scene led to the opening of a nightclub called the Music Institute (MI), located at 1315 Broadway in downtown Detroit. The venue was secured by George Baker and Alton Miller with Darryl Wynn and Derrick May participating as Friday night DJs, and Baker and Chez Damier playing to a mostly gay crowd on Saturday nights.

The club closed on November 24, 1989, with Derrick May playing "Strings of Life" along with a recording of clock tower bells.&lt;ref name=SICKO92&gt;Sicko 1999:92–94&lt;/ref&gt; May explains:

{{quote|It all happened at the right time by mistake, and it didn't last because it wasn't supposed to last. Our careers took off right around the time we [the MI] had to close, and maybe it was the best thing. I think we were peaking – we were so full of energy and we didn't know who we were or [how to] realize our potential. We had no inhibitions, no standards, we just did it. That's why it came off so fresh and innovative, and that's why...we got the best of the best.&lt;ref name=SICKO92/&gt;}}

Though short-lived, MI was known internationally for its all-night sets, its sparse white rooms, and its juice bar stocked with "[[smart drinks]]" (the Institute never served liquor). The MI, notes Dan Sicko, along with Detroit's early techno pioneers, "helped give life to one of the city's important musical subcultures&amp;nbsp;– one that was slowly growing into an international scene."&lt;ref name=SICKO92/&gt;

==Developments==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:URcoverWire.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Underground Resistance (band)|UR]] Featured on the cover of ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'', November 2007]] --&gt;
As the original sound evolved in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it also diverged to such an extent that a wide spectrum of stylistically distinct music was being referred to as techno. This ranged from relatively pop oriented acts such as [[Moby]]&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds 1999:131. ''Moby's track "Go!", a work featuring a sample from the [[Twin Peaks]] opening theme, entered the top 20 of [[UK Singles Chart|UK Charts]] in late 1991.''&lt;/ref&gt; to the distinctly anti-commercial sentiments&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds 1999:219–222. ''Presenting themselves as a sort of techno [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], Underground Resistance were dedicated to 'fighting the power' not just through rhetoric but through fostering their own autonomy.''&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Underground Resistance (band)|Underground Resistance]]. Derrick May's experimentation on works such as ''Beyond the Dance'' (1989) and ''The Beginning'' (1990) were credited with taking techno "in dozens of new directions at once and having the kind of expansive impact John Coltrane had on Jazz".&lt;ref name="Sicko 1999:80"&gt;Sicko 1999:80&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Birmingham]]-based label [[Network Records]] label was instrumental in introducing Detroit techno to British audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|author-link=|last2=|first2=|author2-link=|year=2010|publication-date=|contribution=Techno|contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVxgs_E57_EC&amp;pg=PA942|editor-last=Price|editor-first=Emmett George|title=Encyclopedia of African American Music|volume=3|publication-place=Santa Barbara, CA|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=942|isbn=0313341990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVxgs_E57_EC|accessdate=July 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1990s, the original techno sound had garnered a large underground following in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. The growth of techno's popularity in Europe between 1988 and 1992 was largely due to the emergence of the [[rave]] scene and a thriving club culture.&lt;ref name=SICKO95_120/&gt;

===Exodus===
In America, apart from regional scenes in Detroit, [[New York City]], Chicago, and Orlando  interest was limited. Producers from Detroit, frustrated by the lack of opportunity in their home country, looked to Europe for their future livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds 1999:219&lt;/ref&gt; This first wave of Detroit expatriates was soon joined by a number of up-and-coming artists, the so-called "second wave", including Carl Craig, [[Octave One]], Jay Denham, [[Kenny Larkin]], and [[Stacey Pullen]], with [[Underground Resistance (band)|UR]]'s [[Jeff Mills]], [[Mike Banks (musician)|Mike Banks]], and [[Robert Hood]] pushing their own unique sound. A number of New York producers were also making an impression at this time, notably [[Frankie Bones]], Lenny Dee, and [[Joey Beltram]]. In the same period, close to Detroit ([[Windsor, Ontario]]), [[Richie Hawtin]], with business partner [[John Acquaviva]], launched the influential imprint [[Plus 8]] Records.&lt;ref&gt;Sicko 1999:121–160&lt;/ref&gt;

Developments in American-produced techno between 1990 and 1992 fueled the expansion and eventual divergence of techno in Europe, particularly in Germany.&lt;ref name="Sicko 1999:161–184"&gt;Sicko 1999:161–184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=REYN228&gt;Reynolds 2006:228–229&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Berlin]], following the closure of a free party venue called [[Ufo (Club, Berlin)|Ufo]], the club [[Tresor (club)|Tresor]] opened in 1991. The venue was for a time the standard bearer for techno and played host to many of the leading Detroit producers, some of whom relocated to Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds 1999:215&lt;/ref&gt; By 1993, as interest in techno in the UK club scene started to wane, Berlin was considered the unofficial ''techno capital'' of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Sicko 1999:181&lt;/ref&gt;

Although eclipsed by Germany, [[Belgium]] was another focus of second-wave techno in this time period. The [[Ghent]]-based label [[R&amp;S Records]] embraced harder-edged techno by "teenage prodigies" like Beltram and [[C.J. Bolland]], releasing "tough, metallic tracks...with harsh, discordant synth lines that sounded like distressed Hoovers," according to one music journalist.&lt;ref name=SHALLCROSS&gt;{{Cite news|periodical=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]|issue=161|date=July 1997|title=From Detroit To Deep Space|last=Shallcross|first=Mike|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, [[Sub Club]] opening in [[Glasgow]] in 1987 and [[Trade (nightclub)|Trade]] which opened its doors to [[London]]ers in 1990 were pioneering venues which helped bring techno into the country. Both clubs were praised for their late opening hours and party-focused clientele. Trade has often been referred to as the 'original all night bender'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Simon|title=Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136783166|page=9|url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=BWf4J6yn9zAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ian+Levine+pioneer+English+DJ+and+Producer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2gZ72l-_WAhWCjpQKHbplAhMQ6AEIVjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Resident Advisor.net|url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/club.aspx?id=1918|title=Resident Advisor: Sub Club |publisher=tntmagazine.com|date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=dmcworld.net|url=http://www.dmcworld.net/features/laurence-malice-1/amp/|title=DMC World - Laurence Malice |publisher=tntmagazine.com|date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany's engagement with American underground dance music during the 1980s paralleled that in the UK. By 1987 a German party scene based around the Chicago sound was well established. The following year (1988) saw acid house making as significant an impact on popular consciousness in Germany as it had in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=gu78EKCS54g|title=Short excerpt from special on German "Tele 5" from Dec. 8, 1988}}. The show is called "Tanzhouse" hosted by a young Fred Kogel. It includes footage from Hamburg's "Front" with Boris Dlugosch, Kemal Kurum's "Opera House" and the "Prinzenbar".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 German DJs [[Westbam]] and Dr. Motte established the ''[[Ufo (Club, Berlin)|Ufo club]]'', an illegal party venue, and co-founded the [[Love Parade]].&lt;ref name=ROBB&gt;Robb, D.

[[File:Dorian Gray FFM.jpg|thumb|right| Doorway to [[Dorian Gray (club)|Dorian Gray]], the Frankfurt am Main venue famed for the [[Talla 2XLC]] run Technoclub.]]

In 1991 a number of party venues closed, including ''[[Ufo (Club, Berlin)|Ufo]]'', and the Berlin Techno scene centered itself around three locations close to the foundations of the Berlin Wall: ''Planet'' (later renamed ''[[E-Werk]]'' by Paul van Dyk),&lt;ref name=BREW361&gt;Brewster 2006:361&lt;/ref&gt; ''Der Bunker'', and the relatively long-lived ''Tresor''.&lt;ref&gt;Henkel, O.; Wolff, K. (1996) Berlin Underground: Techno und Hiphop; Zwischen Mythos und Ausverkauf, Berlin: FAB Verlag, (pp. 81–83).&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Tresor at this time that a trend in paramilitary clothing was established (amongst the techno fraternity) by a DJ called [[Tanith (DJ)|Tanith]];&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds 1999:112&lt;/ref&gt; possibly as an expression of a commitment to the underground aesthetic of the music, or perhaps influenced by [[Underground Resistance (band)|UR]]'s paramilitary posturing.&lt;ref&gt;Sicko 1999:145&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, German DJs began intensifying the speed and abrasiveness of the sound, as an acid infused techno began transmuting into [[hardcore techno|hardcore]].&lt;ref&gt;Schuler, M.(1995),''Gabber + Hardcore'', (p. 123), in Anz, P.; Walder, P. (Eds) (1999 rev. edn, 1st publ. 1995, Zurich: Verlag Ricco Bilger)''Techno''. Reinbek: Rowohlt Taschenbuch Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; DJ Tanith commented at the time that "Berlin was always hardcore, hardcore [[hippie]], hardcore punk, and now we have a very hardcore house sound."&lt;ref name=BREW361/&gt; This emerging sound is thought to have been influenced by Dutch [[gabber]] and Belgian hardcore; styles that were in their own perverse way paying homage to [[Underground Resistance (band)|Underground Resistance]] and Richie Hawtin's [[Plus 8 Records]]. Other influences on the development of this style were European [[Electronic Body Music]] (EBM) groups of the mid-1980s such as [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft|DAF]], [[Front 242]], and [[Nitzer Ebb]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds 1999:110&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes were also taking place in Frankfurt during the same period but it did not share the egalitarian approach found in the Berlin party scene. It was instead very much centred around discothèques and existing arrangements with various club owners. In 1988, after the [[:de:Omen (Frankfurt)|Omen]] opened, the Frankfurt dance music scene was allegedly dominated by the club's management and they made it difficult for other promoters to get a start. By the early 1990s [[Sven Väth]] had become perhaps the first DJ in Germany to be worshipped like a rock star. He performed centre stage with his fans facing him, and as co-owner of Omen, he is believed to have been the first techno DJ to run his own club. One of the few real alternatives then was The Bruckenkopf in [[Mainz]], underneath a Rhine bridge, a venue that offered a non-commercial alternative to Frankfurt's [[discothèque]]-based clubs. Other notable underground parties were those run by [[:de:Force Inc. Music Works|Force Inc. Music Works]] and [[:de:Ata (DJ)|Ata]] &amp; [[:de:Heiko M/S/O|Heiko]] from Playhouse records ([[:de:Ongaku Musik|Ongaku Musik]]). By 1992 [[:de:DJ Dag|DJ Dag]] &amp; [[:de:Torsten Fenslau|Torsten Fenslau]] were running a Sunday morning session at [[Dorian Gray (club)|Dorian Gray]], a plush discothèque near the [[Frankfurt airport]]. They initially played a mix of different styles including Belgian [[new beat]], [[Deep House]], Chicago House, and synthpop such as Kraftwerk and Yello and it was out of this blend of styles that the Frankfurt trance scene is believed to have emerged.&lt;ref name="Sextro, M. 2008"&gt;Sextro, M. &amp; Wick H. (2008), ''We Call It Techno!'', Sense Music &amp; Media, Berlin, DE.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993-94 rave became a mainstream music phenomenon in Germany, seeing with it a return to "melody, New Age elements, insistently kitsch harmonies and timbres". This undermining of the German underground sound lead to the consolidation of a German "rave establishment," spearheaded by the party organisation Mayday, with its record label [[Low Spirit]], DJ Westbam, [[Marusha]], and a music channel called [[VIVA (TV station)|VIVA]]. At this time the German popular music charts were riddled with Low Spirit "pop-Tekno" German folk music reinterpretations of tunes such as "Somewhere Over The Rainbow" and "Tears Don't Lie", many of which became hits. At the same time, in Frankfurt, a supposed alternative was a music characterised by Simon Reynolds as "moribund, middlebrow Electro-Trance music, as represented by Frankfurt's own Sven Väth and his [[Harthouse]] label." &lt;ref&gt;Simon Reynolds, in an interview with former [[Mille Plateaux]] label boss Achim Szepanski, for [[Wire Magazine]].

In Germany, fans started to refer to the harder techno sound emerging in the early 1990s as ''[[:de:Tekkno|Tekkno]]'' (or ''Bretter'').&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt; This alternative spelling, with varying numbers of ''k''s, began as a tongue-in-cheek attempt to emphasize the music's hardness, but by the mid-1990s it came to be associated with a controversial point of view that the music was and perhaps always had been wholly separate from Detroit's ''techno'', deriving instead from a 1980s EBM-oriented club scene cultivated in part by DJ/musician [[Talla 2XLC]] in Frankfurt.&lt;ref name=Sicko2010_118120&gt;Sicko 2010:118–120&lt;/ref&gt; Talla, in the early to mid-1980s, worked in City Music at Frankfurt Station and began to categorize artists such as [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Depeche Mode]], Kraftwerk, [[Heaven 17]] and Front 242 under the heading ''techno'', to sum up all technologically created dance  music. In 1984 Talla started an event called [[:de:Technoclub|Technoclub]] on Sunday afternoons at Frankfurts Disco No name, which then moved to the [[Dorian Gray (club)|Dorian Gray]] club in 1987. Talla's club spot served as the hub for the regional EBM and electronic music scene, and according to [[:de:Jürgen Laarmann|Jürgen Laarmann]], of [[:de:Frontpage (Zeitschrift)|Frontpage]] magazine, it had historical merit in being the first club in Germany to play almost exclusively electronic dance music. Technoclub was "more or less an underground thing for suburban kids," it was, according to Laarmann, "never really hip to go there."&lt;ref name="Sextro, M. 2008"/&gt;

At some point tension over "who defines techno" arose between scenes in Frankfurt and Berlin. DJ Tanith has expressed that Techno as a term already existed in Germany but was to a large extent undefined. [[:de:Dimitri Hegemann|Dimitri Hegemann]] has stated that the Frankfurt definition of techno associated with Talla's Technoclub differed from that used in Berlin. Frankfurt's Armin Johnert viewed techno as having its roots in acts such DAF, [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], and [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]], but a younger generation of club goers had a perception of the older EBM and [[Industrial (music)|Industrial]] as handed down and outdated. The Berlin scene offered an alternative and many began embracing an imported sound that was being referred to as ''Techno-House.'' The move away from EBM had started in Berlin when acid house became popular, thanks to Monika Dietl's radio show on [[:de:Sender Freies Berlin|SFB 4]]. Tanith distinguished acid-based dance music from the earlier approaches, whether it be DAF or Nitzer Ebb, because the latter was aggressive, he felt that it epitomised "being against something," but of acid house he said, "it's electronic, it's fun it's nice." By Spring 1990, Tanith, along with [[:de:Wolfram Neugebauer|Wolle XDP]], an East-Berlin party organizer responsible for the X-tasy Dance Project, were organizing the first large scale rave events in Germany. This development would lead to a permanent move away from the sound associated with Techno-House and toward a hard edged mix of music that came to define Tanith and Wolle's [[:de:Tekknozid|Tekknozid]] parties. According to Wolle it was an "out and out rejection of disco values," instead they created a "sound storm" and encouraged a form of "dance floor socialism," where the DJ was not placed in the middle and you "lose yourself in light and sound."&lt;ref name="Sicko2010_118120" /&gt;

====''A Techno Alliance''====
In 1993, the German techno label [[Tresor Records]] released the compilation album ''Tresor II: Berlin &amp; Detroit – A Techno Alliance'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/release/48297 Tresor II: Berlin &amp; Detroit – A Techno Alliance] album details at Discogs&lt;/ref&gt; a testament to the influence of the Detroit sound upon the German techno scene and a celebration of a "mutual admiration pact" between the two cities.&lt;ref name=REYN228/&gt; As the mid-1990s approached, Berlin was becoming a haven for Detroit producers; [[Jeff Mills]] and [[Blake Baxter]] even resided there for a time. In the same period, with the assistance of Tresor, Underground Resistance released their X-101/X-102/X103 album series, Juan Atkins collaborated with 3MB's [[Thomas Fehlmann]] and [[Moritz Von Oswald]]&lt;ref name=REYN228/&gt; and Tresor-affiliated label [[Basic Channel]] had its releases [[Audio mastering|mastered]] by Detroit's National Sound Corporation, the main mastering house for the entire Detroit dance music scene. In a sense, popular electronic music had come full circle, returning to Germany, home of a primary influence on the electronic dance music of the 1980s: [[Düsseldorf]]'s Kraftwerk. Even the dance sounds of Chicago also had a German connection, as it was in [[Munich]] that [[Giorgio Moroder]] and Pete Bellotte first produced the 1970s Eurodisco synthpop sound.&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt;

===Minimal techno===
{{main|Minimal techno}}
As techno continued to transmute a number of Detroit producers began to question the trajectory the music was taking. One response came in the form of so-called [[minimal techno]] (a term producer [[Daniel Bell]] found difficult to accept, finding the term ''minimalism'', in the artistic sense of the word, too "arty").&lt;ref&gt;Sicko 1999:199–200&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that [[Robert Hood]], a Detroit-based producer and one time member of UR, is largely responsible for ushering in the minimal strain of techno.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Banks [http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/271/ interview], The Wire, Issue #285 (November '07)&lt;/ref&gt; Hood describes the situation in the early 1990s as one where techno had become too [[rave|"ravey"]], with increasing tempos, the emergence of [[gabber]], and related trends straying far from the social commentary and [[soul music|soul]]-infused sound of original Detroit techno. In response, Hood and others sought to emphasize a single element of the Detroit aesthetic, interpreting techno with "a basic stripped down, raw sound. Just drums, basslines and funky grooves and only what's essential. Only what is essential to make people move".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spannered.org/music/802/|title=Robert Hood interview|publisher=Overload Media/Spannered|date=February 1, 2001|accessdate=December 2, 2011|last=Osselaer|first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hood explains:

{{quote|I think Dan [Bell] and I both realized that something was missing – an element...in what we both know as techno. It sounded great from a production point of standpoint, but there was a 'jack' element in the [old] structure. People would complain that there's no funk, no feeling in techno anymore, and the easy escape is to put a vocalist and some piano on top to fill the emotional gap. I thought it was time for a return to the original underground.&lt;ref name=SICKO_UNKNOWN/&gt;}}

===Jazz influences===
{{see also|Jazz|Jazz fusion|Musical improvisation}}
Some techno has also been influenced by or directly infused with elements of jazz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Techno Dances With Jazz |first=Mike |last=Rubin  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/30/arts/music-techno-dances-with-jazz.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=New York Times |date=September 30, 2001 |accessdate=December 2, 2011}} "Electronic producers of all stripes are now inspired by a broader jazz palette, whether as fodder for samples, as part of the search for rhythmic diversity, or as a reference point for their own artistic aspirations toward a cerebral sophistication removed from the sweat of the dance floor." The article provides, as examples, the music of [[Kirk Degiorgio]], Matthew Herbert, Spring Heel Jack, Tom Jenkinson (Squarepusher), Jason Swinscoe (Cinematic Orchestra) and Innerzone Orchestra (Carl Craig with ex-Sun Ra/James Carter group members, et al.).&lt;/ref&gt; This led to increased sophistication in the use of both rhythm and harmony in a number of techno productions.&lt;ref&gt;Sicko 1999:198&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manchester]] (UK)-based techno act [[808 State]] helped fuel this development with tracks such as "[[Pacific State (song)|Pacific State]]"&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Simpson ([[A Guy Called Gerald]]) maintains that "Pacific State" was intended for a [[John Peel]] session exclusively, but 808 State's [[Graham Massey]] and Martin Price added additional elements by drawing upon Massey's collection of ''exotic jazz'' records for inspiration. This led to the inclusion of a distinctive saxophone solo. Massey recalls that: ''We were trying to do something in the vein of [[Marshall Jefferson]]'s 'Open Your Eyes'...That track was happening everywhere.'' The production was released as a white label in May 1989 and later issued on the mini-album ''[[Quadrastate]]'' at the end of July that year, just as the [[second Summer of Love]] was flowering. Massey remembers taking the white label to Mike Pickering, Graeme Park, and Jon Da Silva, and notes that ''it rose through the ranks to become the last tune of the night. ''Lawrence, T (2006), ''Discotheque: Haçienda'', sleeve notes for album release of the same name, retrieved from the [http://www.timlawrence.info/linernotes/2006/Hacienda.php authors website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615114018/http://timlawrence.info/linernotes/2006/Hacienda.php |date=2006-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Cobra Bora" in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Butler 2006:114. Graham Massey has discussed the use of unusual meters in 808 State's music commenting online on June 18, 2004, that: ''I always thought Cobra Bora could have stood a chance. It was sometimes played at Hot Night at the Hacienda despite its funny time signature'' (the feel of the track was created by combining parts in 6/8 time with others in 4/4).&lt;/ref&gt; Detroit producer Mike Banks was heavily influenced by jazz, as demonstrated on the influential [[Underground Resistance (band)|Underground Resistance]] release ''Nation 2 Nation'' (1991).&lt;ref name=KODWO&gt;Kodwo 1998:127&lt;/ref&gt; By 1993, Detroit acts such as [[Juan Atkins|Model 500]] and [[Underground Resistance (band)|UR]] had made explicit references to the genre, with the tracks "Jazz Is The Teacher" (1993)&lt;ref name=SHALLCROSS/&gt; and "Hi-Tech Jazz" (1993), the latter being part of a larger body of work and group called [[Galaxy 2 Galaxy]], a self-described jazz project based on Kraftwerk's "man machine" doctrine.&lt;ref name=KODWO/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.submerge.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=SUBCD-3010-2|accessdate=July 21, 2008|title=Galaxy 2 Galaxy – A Hi Tech Jazz Compilation|publisher=Submerge|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705073046/http://www.submerge.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=SUBCD-3010-2|archivedate=July 5, 2008|df=}} "Galaxy 2 Galaxy is a band that was conceptualized with the first hitech Jazz record produced by UR in 1986/87 and later released in 1990 which was ''Nation 2 Nation'' (UR-005). Jeff Mills and Mike Banks had visions of Jazz music and musicians operating on the same "man machine" doctrine dropped on them from Kraftwerk. Early experiments with synthesizers and jazz by artists like Herbie Hancock, Stevie Wonder, Weather Report, Return to Forever, Larry Heard and Lenny White's Astral Pirates also pointed them in this direction. UR went on to produce and further innovate this form of music which was coined 'Hitech Jazz' by fans after the historic 1993 release of UR's ''Galaxy 2 Galaxy'' (UR-025) album which included the underground UR smash titled 'Hitech Jazz'."&lt;/ref&gt; This lead was followed by a number of techno producers in the UK who were influenced by both jazz and UR, [[Dave Angel]]'s "Seas of Tranquility" EP (1994) being a case in point,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title= Dave Angel: Background Overview at Discogs |date=February 13, 2003 | publisher= | url =http://www.discogs.com/artist/Dave+Angel | work = | pages = | accessdate = August 11, 2007 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techno.de/mixmag/interviews/dave.html Angelic Upstart]: ''Mixmag'' interview with Dave Angel detailing his interest in jazz.

===Intelligent techno===
{{see also|Intelligent dance music|ambient techno}}
In 1991 UK music journalist Matthew Collin wrote that "Europe may have the scene and the energy, but it's America which supplies the ideological direction...if Belgian techno gives us riffs, German techno the noise, British techno the breakbeats, then Detroit supplies the sheer cerebral depth."&lt;ref&gt;Brewster 2006:364&lt;/ref&gt; By 1992 a number of European producers and labels began to associate rave culture with the corruption and commercialization of the original techno ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds 1999:183&lt;/ref&gt; Following this the notion of an ''intelligent'' or Detroit inspired ''pure techno'' aesthetic began to take hold. Detroit techno had maintained its integrity throughout the rave era and was pushing a new generation of so-called ''intelligent techno'' producers forward. Simon Reynolds suggests that this progression "involved a full-scale retreat from the most radically posthuman and hedonistically functional aspects of rave music toward more traditional ideas about creativity, namely the auteur theory of the solitary genius who humanizes technology."&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds 1999:182&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[intelligent techno]]'' was used to differentiate more sophisticated versions of underground techno &lt;ref&gt;Anker M., Herrington T., Young R. (1995), [http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/220/ ''New Complexity Techno''], ''The Wire'', Issue #131 (January '95)&lt;/ref&gt; from rave-oriented styles such as [[breakbeat hardcore]], Schranz, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Gabber]]. [[Warp Records]] was among the first to capitalize upon this development with the release of the compilation album ''[[Artificial Intelligence (compilation album)|Artificial Intelligence]]''&lt;ref&gt;Track listing for the Warp Records 1992 compilation [http://www.discogs.com/release/29372 ''Artificial Intelligence'']&lt;/ref&gt; Of this time, Warp founder and managing director Steve Beckett said 

{{quote|the dance scene was changing and we were hearing B-sides that weren't dance but were interesting and fitted into experimental, progressive rock, so we decided to make the compilation ''Artificial Intelligence'', which became a milestone... it felt like we were leading the market rather than it leading us, the music was aimed at home listening rather than clubs and dance floors: people coming home, off their nuts, and having the most interesting part of the night listening to totally tripped out music. The sound fed the scene.&lt;ref&gt;Birke S. (2007), [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/music-magazine/label-profile/label-profile-warp-records-768021.html "Label Profile: Warp Records"], The Independent (UK), Music Magazine (supplement), newspaper article published February 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Warp had originally marketed ''Artificial Intelligence'' using the description ''electronic listening music'' but this was quickly replaced by ''intelligent techno''. In the same period (1992–93) other names were also bandied about such as armchair techno, [[ambient techno]], and [[electronica]],&lt;ref&gt;"Of all the terms devised for contemporary non-academic electronic music (the sense intended here), 'electronica' is one of the most loaded and controversial. While on the one hand it does seem the most convenient catch-all phrase, under any sort of scrutiny it begins to implode. In its original 1992–93 sense it was largely coterminous with the more explicitly elitist 'intelligent techno', a term used to establish distance from and imply distaste for, all other more dancefloor-oriented types of techno, ignoring the fact that many of its practitioners such as Richard James ([[Aphex Twin]]) were as adept at brutal dancefloor tracks as what its detractors present as self-indulgent ambient 'noodling'". Blake, Andrew, ''Living Through Pop'', Routledge, 1999. p 155.&lt;/ref&gt; but all were used to describe an emerging form of ''post-rave'' dance music for the "sedentary and stay at home".&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds 1999:181&lt;/ref&gt; Following the commercial success of the compilation in the United States, [[Intelligent Dance Music]] eventually became the phrase most commonly used to describe much of the experimental dance music emerging during the mid-to-late 1990s.

Although it is primarily Warp that has been credited with ushering the commercial growth of IDM and electronica, in the early 1990s there were many notable labels associated with the initial ''intelligence'' trend that received little, if any, wider attention. Amongst others they include: [[Black Dog Productions]] (1989), Carl Craig's Planet E (1991), Kirk Degiorgio's Applied Rhythmic Technology (1991), Eevo Lute Muzique (1991), General Production Recordings (1991), New Electronica (1993), [[Mille Plateaux]] (1993), 100% Pure (1993), and Ferox Records (1993).

===Free techno===
{{see also|Free tekno|Freetekno|Teknival|Free Party|Acid techno|DIY culture}}
[[File:Algorythm duracell enzo pk zinix zbomb sound6tems.jpg|thumb|right|A sound system at Czechtek 2004]]
In the early 1990s a post-rave, [[DIY ethic|DIY]], [[free party]] scene had established itself in the UK. It was largely based around an alliance between warehouse party goers from various urban [[Squatting|squat]] scenes and politically inspired [[new age travellers]]. The new agers offered a readymade network of countryside festivals that were hastily adopted by squatters and ravers alike.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds 1999:163. ''The traveling lifestyle began in the early seventies, as convoys of hippies spent the summer wandering from site to site on the free festival circuit. Gradually, these proto-[[crusty]] remnants of the original [[counterculture]] built up a neomedieval [[economy]] based on crafts, alternative medicine, and entertainment...In the mid-eighties, as [[squatting]] became a less viable option and the government mounted a clampdown on welfare claimants, many urban crusties tired of the squalor of settled life and took to the roving lifestyle.''&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent among the [[Sound reinforcement system|sound systems]] operating at this time were Exodus in Luton, Tonka in [[Brighton]], Smokescreen in [[Sheffield]], [[The DiY Sound System|DiY]] in [[Nottingham]], Bedlam, Circus Warp, LSDiesel and London's [[Spiral Tribe]]. The high point of this free party period came in May 1992 when with less than 24 hours notice and little publicity more than 35,000 gathered at the [[Castlemorton Common Festival]] for 5 days of partying.&lt;ref name=STJOHN&gt;St. John 2001:100–101&lt;/ref&gt;

This one event was largely responsible for the introduction in 1994 of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice and Public Order Act]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1994/Ukpga_19940033_en_6.htm#mdiv63 |title=Public Order: Collective Trespass or Nuisance on Land – Powers in relation to raves |work=Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 |publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]] |accessdate=January 17, 2006| year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively leaving the British [[free party]] scene for dead. Following this many of the traveller artists moved away from Britain to Europe, the US, [[Goa]] in [[India]], [[Koh Phangan]] in [[Thailand]] and [[Australia|Australia's]] East Coast.&lt;ref name=STJOHN/&gt; In the rest of Europe, due in some part to the inspiration of traveling sound systems from the UK,&lt;ref name=STJOHN/&gt; rave enjoyed a prolonged existence as it continued to expand across the [[continental Europe|continent]].&lt;ref name="Sicko 1999:161–184"/&gt;

Spiral Tribe, Bedlam and other English sound systems took their cooperative techno ideas to Europe, particularly [[Eastern Europe]] where it was cheaper to live, and audiences were quick to appropriate the free party ideology. It was European [[Teknival]] free parties, such as the annual [[Czechtek]] event in the Czech Republic that gave rise to several French, German and Dutch sound systems. Many of these groups found audiences easily and were often centered around squats in cities such as [[Amsterdam]] and [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name=STJOHN/&gt;

===Divergence===
{{see also|List of electronic music genres}}
By 1994 there were a number of techno producers in the UK and Europe building on the Detroit sound, but a number of other underground dance music styles were by then vying for attention. Some drew upon the Detroit techno aesthetic, while others fused components of preceding dance music forms. This led to the appearance (in the UK initially) of inventive new music that sounded far-removed from techno. For instance [[oldschool jungle|jungle]] ([[drum and bass]]) demonstrated influences ranging from [[hip-hop]], soul, and [[reggae]] to techno and house.

With an increasing diversification (and commercialization) of dance music, the collectivist sentiment prominent in the early [[rave]] scene diminished, each new faction having its own particular attitude and vision of how dance music (or in certain cases, non-dance music) should evolve. Some examples not already mentioned are [[trance music|trance]], [[industrial techno]], [[breakbeat hardcore]], [[acid techno]], and [[happy hardcore]]. Less well-known styles related to techno or its subgenres include the primarily Sheffield (UK)-based bleep techno, a regional variant that had some success between 1989 and 1991. &lt;!-- and a scene that was responsible for putting [[Warp (record label)|Warp Records]] on the map (largely as a result of its fifth release, [[LFO (British band)|LFO]]'s self-titled 12″).{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} --&gt;

According to [[Muzik]] magazine, by 1995 the UK techno scene was in decline and dedicated club nights were dwindling. The music had become "too hard, too fast, too male, too drug-oriented, too anally retentive." Despite this, weekly night at clubs such as Final Frontier (London), House of God ([[Birmingham sound|Birmingham]]), Pure (Edinburgh, whose resident DJ Twitch later founded the more eclectic [[Optimo]]), and Bugged Out (Manchester) were still popular. With techno reaching a state of "creative palsy," and with a disproportionate number of underground dance music enthusiasts more interested in the sounds of rave and jungle, in 1995 the future of the UK techno scene looked uncertain as the market for "pure techno" waned. Muzik described the sound of UK techno at this time as "dutiful grovelling at the altar of American techno with a total unwillingness to compromise." &lt;ref&gt;Bush, Calvin, Techno - The Final Frontier?, ''Muzik'', Issue No.4, September 1995, p.48-50&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 1990s, a number of post-techno &lt;ref&gt;Cox 2004:414. ''Any form of electronica genealogically related to Techno but departing from it in one way or another.''&lt;/ref&gt; underground styles had emerged, including [[ghettotech]] (a style that combines some of the aesthetics of techno with [[Hip-hop music|hip-hop]] and [[house music]]), [[nortec]], [[glitch (music)|glitch]], [[digital hardcore]], the so-called ''no-beat techno'',&lt;ref&gt;Loubet E.&amp; Couroux M., Laptop Performers, Compact Disc Designers, and No-Beat Techno Artists in Japan: Music from Nowhere,  ''Computer Music Journal'', Vol. 24, No. 4. (Winter, 2000), pp. 19–32.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[electroclash]].&lt;ref name="spectator_clash"/&gt;

In attempting to sum up the changes since the heyday of Detroit techno, Derrick May has since revised his famous quote in stating that "Kraftwerk got off on the third floor and now George Clinton's got [[Napalm Death]] in there with him. The elevator's stalled between the pharmacy and the athletic wear store."&lt;ref name=FantaziaMay /&gt;

===Commercial exposure===
[[File:Underworld tour1s.jpg|thumb|right|[[Underworld (band)|Underworld]] during a live performance]]
While techno and its derivatives only occasionally produce commercially successful mainstream acts—[[Underworld (band)|Underworld]] and [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]] being two better-known examples—the genre has significantly affected many other areas of music. In an effort to appear relevant, many established artists, for example [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[U2]], have dabbled with dance music, yet such endeavors have rarely evidenced a genuine understanding or appreciation of techno's origins with the former proclaiming in January 1996 that "Techno=Death".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music and Technoculture|pages=185–186|first=Andrew|last=Ross|first2=René|last2=Lysloff|first3=Leslie|last3=Gay|isbn=0-8195-6514-8|year=2003|publisher=Wesleyan University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaplin, Julia &amp; Michel, Sia.

The R&amp;B artist, [[Missy Elliott]], exposed the popular music audience to the Detroit techno sound when she featured material from Cybotron's ''Clear'' on her 2006 release "Lose Control"; this resulted in [[Juan Atkins]]' receiving a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for his writing credit. Elliott's 2001 album ''[[Miss E... So Addictive]]'' also clearly demonstrated the influence of techno inspired club culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sal |last=Cinquemani |title=Miss E...So Addictive |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=64 |publisher=[[Slant Magazine]] |accessdate=December 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102040143/http://slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=64 |archivedate=January 2, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the publication of relatively accurate histories by authors Simon Reynolds (''Generation Ecstasy'', also known as ''Energy Flash'') and Dan Sicko (''Techno Rebels''), plus mainstream press coverage of the [[Detroit Electronic Music Festival]], have helped to diffuse the genre's more dubious mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Robert | last=Gorell | title=Permanent record: Jeff Mills talks Detroit techno and the exhibit that hopes to explain it. | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=4496 | work =Metro Times | accessdate = August 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the Detroit-based company [[Ford Motors]] eventually became savvy to the mass appeal of techno, noting that "this music was created partly by the pounding clangor of the Motor City's auto factories. It became natural for us to incorporate Detroit techno into our commercials after we discovered that young people are embracing techno."

==Antecedents==

===Proto-techno===
The popularity of [[Euro disco]] and [[Italo disco]]—referred to as ''progressive'' in Detroit—and [[new romantic]] [[synthpop]] in the Detroit high school party scene from which techno emerged&lt;ref&gt;Sicko 1999:45–49&lt;/ref&gt; has prompted a number of commentators to try to redefine the origins of techno by incorporating musical precursors to the Detroit sound as part of a wider historical survey of the genre's development.&lt;ref name=KODWO100/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brewster 2006:343–346&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reynolds 1999:190"&gt;Reynolds 1999:190&lt;/ref&gt; The search for a mythical "first techno record" leads such commentators to consider music from long before the 1988 naming of the genre. Aside from the artists whose music was popular in the Detroit high school scene ("progressive" disco acts such as Giorgio Moroder, [[Alexander Robotnick]], and [[Claudio Simonetti]] and synthpop artists such as [[Visage (band)|Visage]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[The Human League]], and [[Heaven 17]]), they point to examples such as "Sharevari" (1981) by A Number of Names,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gillen|first=Brendan|date=November 21, 2001|accessdate=January 10, 2009|url=http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=2691|title=Name that number: The history of Detroit's first techno record|journal=Metro Times Detroit}}&lt;/ref&gt; danceable selections from Kraftwerk (1977–83), the earliest compositions by Cybotron (1981), Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder's "I Feel Love" (1977), Moroder's "From Here to Eternity" (1977), and [[Manuel Göttsching]]'s "proto-techno masterpiece"&lt;ref name="Reynolds 1999:190"/&gt; ''[[E2-E4]]'' (1981). Another example is a record entitled ''Love in C minor'', released in 1976 by Parisian Euro disco producer [[Jean-Marc Cerrone]]; cited as the first so called "conceptual disco" production and the record from which house, techno, and other underground dance music styles flowed.&lt;ref&gt;Sicko 1999:48&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another example is Yellow Magic Orchestra's work which has been described as "proto-techno"&lt;ref name="keyboard_28"&gt;{{cite book|title=Keyboard, Volume 19, Issues 7-12|publisher=GPI Publications|year=1993|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kJ4JAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kpcc_takahashi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Stenshoel's Album of the Week: What, Me Worry? by Yukihiro Takahashi|publisher=[[KPCC]]|date=May 18, 2011|author=Peter Stenshoel|url=http://www.scpr.org/blogs/offramp/2011/05/18/peter-stenshoels-album-week-what-me-worry-yukihiro|accessdate=June 4, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; YMO had also used the prefix "techno" in a number of titles including the song "Technopolis" (1979), the album ''Technodelic'' (1981), and a rare [[flexi disc]] EP, "The Spirit of Techno" (1983).

===Prehistory===
Certain electro-[[disco]] and European synthpop productions share with techno a dependence on machine-generated dance rhythms, but such comparisons are not without contention. Efforts to regress further into the past, in search of earlier antecedents, entails a further regression, to the sequenced electronic music of [[Raymond Scott]], whose "The Rhythm Modulator," "The Bass-Line Generator," and "IBM Probe" are considered early examples of techno-like music. In a review of Scott's [[Manhattan Research Inc. (Raymond Scott album)|Manhattan Research Inc.]] compilation album the [[England|English]] newspaper [[The Independent]] suggested that "Scott's importance lies mainly in his realization of the rhythmic possibilities of [[electronic music]], which laid the foundation for all electro-pop from disco to techno."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Raymond Scott's Manhattan Research |date=February 21, 2006 |url=http://raymondscott.com/mripr.html |accessdate=August 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813132527/http://raymondscott.com/mripr.html |archivedate=August 13, 2007 |df= }} Extensive collection of review excerpts hosted on the Raymond Scott website.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a tape from the mid-to-late 1960s by the original composer of the [[Doctor Who]] theme [[Delia Derbyshire]], was found to contain music that sounded remarkably like contemporary electronic dance music. Commenting on the tape, [[Paul Hartnoll]], of the dance group [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]], described the example as "quite amazing," noting that it sounded not unlike something that "could be coming out next week on [[Warp Records]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7512072.stm|title=Lost tapes of the Dr Who composer|publisher=BBC News|last=Wrench|first=Nigel|accessdate=January 10, 2009 | date=July 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music production practice==

===Stylistic considerations===
{{Listen
 |filename=
 |title="G Force (Energy Flow)" by The Prodigy
 |description=[[The Prodigy]] is a techno music group that broke into the mainstream in the 1990s.
}}
In general, techno is very [[disc jockey|DJ]]-friendly, being mainly [[instrumental]] (commercial varieties being an exception) and is produced with the intention of its being heard in the context of a continuous [[DJ mix|DJ set]], wherein the DJ progresses from one record to the next via a synchronized [[segue]] or "mix."&lt;ref&gt;Butler 2006:12–13,94&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]] in techno emphasizes the role of [[rhythm]] over other musical parameters, but the design of [[synthesizer|synthetic]] [[timbre]]s, and the creative use of [[music technology|music production technology]] in general, are important aspects of the overall [[aesthetics of music|aesthetic]] practice.

Unlike other forms of electronic dance music that tend to be produced with [[Keyboard instrument|synthesizer keyboards]], techno does not always strictly adhere to the [[harmony|harmonic practice]] of [[Classical music|Western music]] and such strictures are often ignored in favor of timbral manipulation alone.&lt;ref&gt;Fikentscher, K. (1991), ''The Decline of Functional Harmony in Contemporary Dance Music'', Paper presented at the 6th International Conference On Popular Music Studies, Berlin, Germany, July 15–20, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus techno inherits from the modernist tradition of the so-called [[Klangfarbenmelodie]], or timbral serialism. The use of [[motif (music)|motivic development]] (though relatively limited) and the employment of conventional musical frameworks is more widely found in commercial techno styles, for example [[Eurodance|euro-trance]], where the template is often an [[Thirty-two-bar form|AABA song structure]].&lt;ref&gt;Pope, R. (2011), Hooked on an Affect: Detroit Techno and Dystopian Digital Culture, ''Dancecult: Journal of Electronic Dance Music Culture'' 2 (1): p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The main drum part is almost universally in [[common time]] (4/4); meaning 4 [[quarter note]] [[pulse (music)|pulses]] per bar.&lt;ref&gt;Butler 2006:8&lt;/ref&gt; In its simplest form, [[time]] is marked with kicks ([[bass drum]] beats) on each quarter-note pulse, a [[snare drum|snare]] or clap on the second and fourth pulse of the bar, with an open [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] sound every second eighth note. This is essentially a [[disco]] (or even [[polka]]) drum pattern and is common throughout [[house music|house]] and [[trance music]] as well. The [[tempo]] tends to vary between approximately 120 [[beats per minute|bpm]] (quarter note equals 120 pulses per minute) and 150 bpm, depending on the style of techno.

Some of the [[drum machine|drum programming]] employed in the original Detroit-based techno made use of [[syncopation]] and [[polyrhythm]], yet in many cases the basic disco-type pattern was used as a foundation, with polyrhythmic elaborations added using other [[drum machine]] voices. This syncopated-feel ([[funk]]iness) distinguishes the Detroit strain of techno from other variants. It is a feature that many DJs and producers still use to differentiate their music from commercial forms of techno, the majority of which tend to be devoid of syncopation. Derrick May has summed up the sound as 'Hi-tech Tribalism': something "very spiritual, very bass oriented, and very drum oriented, very percussive. The original techno music was very hi-tech with a very percussive feel... it was extremely, extremely Tribal. It feels like you're in some sort of hi-tech village."&lt;ref name=LUNAR/&gt;

===Compositional techniques===
[[File:producerschair.jpg|thumb|right|Example of a professional production environment]]
There are many ways to create techno, but the majority will depend upon the use of loop-based [[Music sequencer|step sequencing]] as a compositional method. Techno musicians, or ''[[record producer|producers]]'', rather than employing traditional [[Musical composition|compositional techniques]], may work in an [[Musical improvisation|improvisatory]] fashion,&lt;ref&gt;Butler 2006:208–209,214&lt;/ref&gt; often treating the electronic [[music studio]] as one large instrument. The collection of devices found in a typical studio will include units that are capable of producing many different sounds and effects. Studio production equipment is generally [[Synchronization|synchronized]] using a hardware- or computer-based [[MIDI sequencer]], enabling the producer to combine in one arrangement the sequenced output of many devices. A typical approach to using this type of technology compositionally is to [[overdubbing|overdub]] successive layers of material while continuously looping a single [[bar (music)|measure]] or sequence of measures. This process will usually continue until a suitable [[Multitrack recording|multi-track]] arrangement has been produced.&lt;ref&gt;Butler 2006:94&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a single loop-based arrangement has been generated, a producer may then focus on developing how the summing of the overdubbed parts will unfold in time, and what the final structure of the piece will be. Some producers achieve this by adding or removing layers of material at appropriate points in the mix. Quite often, this is achieved by physically manipulating a [[mixing console|mixer]], sequencer, effects, [[dynamic range compression|dynamic processing]], [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]], and [[audio filter|filtering]] while recording to a multi-track device. Other producers achieve similar results by using the automation features of computer-based [[digital audio workstation]]s. Techno can consist of little more than cleverly programmed rhythmic sequences and looped motifs combined with [[Digital signal processing|signal processing]] of one variety or another, frequency [[audio filter|filtering]] being a commonly used process. A more idiosyncratic approach to production is evident in the music of artists such as Twerk and [[Autechre]], where aspects of [[algorithmic composition]] are employed in the generation of material.

===Retro technology===
[[File:Roland TR-808 drum machine.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The [[Roland TR-808]] was, according to [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]], the preferred drum machine during the early years of techno.&lt;ref name="MUZIK01"&gt;[[System 7 (band)|System 7]] interview with Mark Roland in: ''Muzik'', Issue No.4, September 1995, p.97&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Instruments used by the original techno producers based in Detroit, many of which are now highly sought after on the retro music technology market, include classic drum machines like the Roland [[TR-808]] and [[TR-909]], devices such as the Roland [[TB-303]] bass line generator, and synthesizers such as the [[Roland SH-101]], Kawai KC10, [[Yamaha DX7]], and Yamaha DX100 (as heard on Derrick May's seminal 1987 techno release ''Nude Photo'').&lt;ref name="Sicko 1999:80"/&gt; Much of the early music sequencing was executed via [[MIDI]] (but neither the TR-808 nor the TB-303 had MIDI, only [[DIN sync]]) using hardware sequencers such as the Korg SQD1 and Roland MC-50, and the limited amount of [[sampling (music)|sampling]] that was featured in this early style was accomplished using an [[Akai S900]].&lt;ref&gt;Keyboard Magazine Vol. 21, No.7 (issue #231), July 1995, ''12 Who Count: Juan Atkins''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The TR-808 and TR-909 drum machines have since achieved legendary status, a fact that is now reflected in the prices sought for used devices. During the 1980s, the 808 became the staple beat machine in [[Hip hop]] production while the 909 found its home in [[House music]] and techno. It was "the pioneers of Detroit techno [who] were making the 909 the rhythmic basis of their sound, and setting the stage for the rise of Roland's vintage Rhythm Composer." In November 1995 the UK music technology magazine ''[[Sound on Sound]]'' noted:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1995_articles/nov95/rolandtr909.html 909 LIVES!]: Overview of the Roland TR-909 drum machine published by ''Sound on Sound'' magazine in November 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|There can be few hi-tech instruments which still command a second-hand price only slightly lower than their original selling price 10 years after their launch. Roland's now near-legendary TR-909 is such an example—released in 1984 with a retail price of £999, they now fetch up to £900 on the second-hand market! The irony of the situation is that barely a year after its launch, the 909 was being 'chopped out' by hi-tech dealers for around £375, to make way for the then-new TR-707 and TR-727. Prices hit a new low around 1988, when you could often pick up a second-user 909 for under £200—and occasionally even under £100. Musicians all over the country are now garrotting themselves with MIDI leads as they remember that 909 they sneered at for £100—or worse, the one they sold for £50 (did you ever hear the one about the guy who gave away his TB-303 Bassline—now worth anything up to £900 from true loony collectors—because he couldn't sell it?)}}

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Reason4 screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|[[Reason (software)|Reason]]: a popular software-based music production environment]] --&gt;

By May 1996, ''Sound on Sound'' was reporting that the popularity of the 808 had started to decline, with the rarer TR-909 taking its place as "the dance floor drum machine to use." This is thought to have arisen for a number of reasons: the 909 gives more control over the drum sounds, has better programming and includes MIDI as standard. ''Sound on Sound'' reported that the 909 was selling for between £900 and £1100 and noted that the 808 was still collectible, but maximum prices had peaked at about £700 to £800.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/may97/rolandtr808.html 808 Statement]: Overview of the Roland TR-808 drum machine published by ''Sound on Sound'' magazine in May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Such prices have held in the 12 years since the article was published, this can be evidenced by a quick search on [[eBay]]. Despite this fascination with retro music technology, according to Derrick May   "there is no recipe, there is no keyboard or drum machine which makes the best techno, or whatever you want to call it. There never has been. It was down to the preferences of a few guys. The 808 was our preference. We were using Yamaha drum machines, different percussion machines, whatever."&lt;ref name="MUZIK01" /&gt;

====Emulation====
In the latter half of the 1990s the demand for vintage drum machines and synthesizers motivated a number of software companies to produce computer-based emulators. One of the most notable was the ''[[ReBirth RB-338]]'', produced by the Swedish company [[Propellerhead]] and originally released in May 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/aug97/rebirthaug97.html BORN WIBBLY] Steinberg/Propellerheads Rebirth RB-338 v2.0 Techno Microcomposer Software For Mac &amp; PC. Overview of the original ReBirth RB-338 published by ''Sound on Sound'' magazine in August 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Version one of the software featured two TB-303s and a TR-808 only, but the release of version two saw the inclusion of a TR-909. A ''Sound on Sound'' review of the RB-338 V2 in November 1998 noted that Rebirth had been called "the ultimate techno software package" and mentions that it was "a considerable software success story of 1997".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov98/articles/rebirth.htm THE COOL OF REBIRTH]
 Steinberg/Propellerheads Rebirth RB-338 v2.0 Techno Microcomposer Software For Mac &amp; PC. Overview of the ReBirth RB-338 V2 published by ''Sound on Sound'' magazine in November 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In America ''Keyboard Magazine'' asserted that ReBirth had "opened up a whole new [[paradigm]]: modeled analog synthesizer tones, percussion synthesis, pattern-based sequencing, all integrated in one piece of software".&lt;ref&gt;Jim Aikin, Keyboard Magazine, reprinted in Software Synthesizers: The Definitive Guide to Virtual Musical Instruments. Backbeat Books, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the success of ReBirth RB-338, it was officially taken out of production in September 2005. Propellerhead then made it freely available for download from a website called the "ReBirth Museum". The site also features extensive information about the software's history and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rebirthmuseum.com/|title=ReBirth: virtual synthesizer and drum machine iPad app - Propellerhead|website=Rebirthmuseum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2001, with the release of [[Reason (software)|Reason]] V1, Propellerhead upped the ante in providing a £300 software-based electronic music studio, comprising a 14-input automated digital mixer, 99-note polyphonic 'analogue' synth, classic Roland-style drum machine, sample-playback unit, analogue-style step sequencer, loop player, multitrack sequencer, eight effects processors, and over 500&amp;nbsp;MB of synthesizer patches and samples. With this release Propellerhead were credited with "creating a buzz that only happens when a product has really tapped into the [[zeitgeist]], and may just be the one that many [were] waiting for."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/mar01/articles/propellorhead.asp REASONS TO BE CHEERFUL] Propellerhead Software Reason Virtual Music Studio.

===Technological advances===
As computer technology became more accessible and [[music software]] advanced, interacting with music production technology was possible using means that bore little relationship to traditional [[performance|musical performance]] practices:&lt;ref&gt;Emmerson, S. (2007), ''Living Electronic Music'', Ashgate, Adlershot, pp. 111–113.&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, [[laptop computer|laptop]] performance (''laptronica'')&lt;ref&gt;Emmerson, S. (2007), pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[live coding]].&lt;ref&gt;Emmerson, S.

By the mid 2000s a number of software-based virtual studio environments had emerged, with products such as Propellerhead's [[Reason (software)|Reason]] and [[Ableton Live]] finding popular appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wintermusicconference.com/events/idmas/winners2008.php |title=23rd Annual International Dance Music Awards Nominees &amp; Winners |accessdate=January 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501041708/http://www.wintermusicconference.com/events/idmas/winners2008.php |archivedate=May 1, 2008 |df= }} Best Audio Editing Software of the Year – 1st Ableton Live, 4th Reason. Best Audio DJ Software of the Year – Ableton Live.&lt;/ref&gt; These software-based music production tools offer viable and cost-effective alternatives to typical hardware-based production studios, and thanks to advances in [[microprocessor]] technology, can create high quality music using little more than a single laptop computer. Such advances democratized music creation,&lt;ref&gt;Chadabe, J., Electronic music and life, ''Organised Sound'', 9(1): 3–6, 2004 Cambridge University Press, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; and lead to a massive increase in the amount of home-produced music available to the general public via the internet. Artists can now also individuate their sound by creating personalized software synthesizers, effects modules, and various composition environments. Devices that once existed exclusively in the hardware domain can easily have virtual counterparts. Some of the more popular software tools for achieving such ends are commercial releases such as [[Max/Msp]] and [[Reaktor]] and [[freeware]] packages such as [[Pure Data]], [[SuperCollider]], and [[ChucK]]. In some sense, as a result of technological innovation, the [[DIY culture|DIY]] mentality that was once a core part of dance music culture&lt;ref&gt;St. John, G.(ed.), ''FreeNRG: Notes From the Edge of the Dance Floor'', Common Ground, Melbourne, 2001, (pp. 93–102).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rietveld, H (1998), ''Repetitive Beats: Free Parties and the Politics of Contemporary DIY Dance Culture in Britain'', in George McKay (ed.), ''DIY Culture: Party and Protest in Nineties Britain'', pp.243–67.

[[Image:TARSlogo.jpg|thumb|TARS logo]]
'''The Arthur Ransome Society''', also known by its [[acronym]] '''Tars''', and whose members refer to themselves as ''[[Jack Tar|Tars]]'', is a society whose goals are to "celebrate the life, promote the works, and diffuse the ideas of [[Arthur Ransome]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is based at the [[Abbot Hall Art Gallery]] in [[Kendal]], [[England]].

==History==

In 1984, [[Christina Hardyment]] had written an account of her own investigations into the real-life places and real-life people in Arthur Ransome's stories. As a direct result of this book, ''Arthur Ransome and Captain Flint's Trunk'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; people interested in forming a society dedicated to Arthur Ransome had been leaving their contact details at Abbot Hall, where, following his death in 1967, his widow Evgenia had donated various articles, including his writing desk. In 1989, Christina followed up on these contact details by sending an appeal for funds to restore the dilapidated ''Mavis'', the supposed prototype for Arthur Ransome's ''Amazon.'' The response to this appeal was overwhelming and in June 1990 The Arthur Ransome Society was formed.

A particularly large sum came from the [[Arthur Ransome Club]] (ARC) of Japan. The ceremony was attended by Christina Hardyment, Tamami Nakayama of ARC and [[Brigit Sanders]] (née Altounyan), a prototype of the character Bridget Walker. Brigit Sanders subsequently became President of TARS.

In 1997, the society was incorporated as a [[Private company limited by guarantee|Company Limited by Guarantee]].

==TARS now==

TARS produces several regular publications, holds many recreational and scholarly events and maintains a Ransome-themed website [http://www.arthur-ransome.org/ar/]. TARS has a wide international membership base which includes branches in Australia, Canada, USA and New Zealand.In the UK there are 6 different regions: Scottish, Northern, Midland, Eastern, South Western and Southern, each with its own leadership committee. They also organize local events which are open all members. Every year one region in the UK takes its turn to host the International Annual General Meeting (IAGM).

TARS has a subsidiary, Amazon Publications, which publishes both original books and reprints of books associated with Ransome.

There are strong links with the [[Arthur Ransome Club]] in Japan but no direct association.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5499">"'''The Moonlit Road'''" is a [[gothic horror]] [[short story]]  by American Civil War soldier, wit, and writer [[Ambrose Bierce]]. It first appeared in a 1907 issue of ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine, illustrated by Charles B. Falls. This story is presented in three parts and relates the tale of the murder of Julia Hetman from the perspective of her son, a man who may be her husband, and Julia herself, through a medium.

==Synopsis==

The first part is narrated by Joel Hetman, Jr. He is summoned home from college by his father, because his mother, Julia, has been found [[strangulation|strangled]]. His father claims that he returned from a business trip and saw the figure of a man fleeing the home. Upon entering the house, he found his wife lying dead in her bedroom. Months later, the father and son are walking down a moonlit road when the father sees something and suddenly turns pale and disappeared into the night.

In the second part of the story is narrated by a man who describes himself as a wandering outcast, wracked by guilt. He recounts a dream in which he suspects his wife is being unfaithful and he returns from a business trip early to find a strange man leaving his house. When he finds his wife cowering in her room, he murders her in a fit of jealous rage. In another dream, his wife's ghost confronts him on a moonlit road at night and the strangulation marks are still visible on her neck.

The third and final section is the statement of the murder victim, Julia Hetman, delivered through a [[Mediumship|medium]]. She describes the night she was murdered. Alone in the house, she heard frightening noises and believed she was being hunted by some creature of the night. While she cowered in the corner of her room, a man entered and strangled her, but she never saw his face. Later, upon seeing that her husband and son were sad, she tried to communicate with them from the spirit world and offer them comfort. She was finally able to appear to them on the moonlit road, but only her husband could see her and he fled in fear.

== Analysis ==
Bierce harbored a fear of dying, and this frequently provided inspiration for his fiction. He experienced guilt due to his estrangement from his mother and he also divorced his wife after finding that she had been unfaithful. These traits may have inspired the fictional events in "The Moonlit Road".&lt;ref&gt;Talley, Sharon (2009). ''Ambrose Bierce and the Dance of Death''. Knoxville, Tennessee: University of Tennessee Press. P. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story may serve as an illustration of [[William James]]'s thesis that "it is not so much the truth of events that matters, but how they are perceived, and the difference that they make to the perceiver".&lt;ref name="gothic"&gt;''The Handbook to Gothic Literature'' (ed. Marie Mulvey-Roberts). New York University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|9780814756096}}. P. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The murderer thought the ghost of his victim was aware of his culpability, for her eyes fixed on his "with an infinite gravity which is not reproach, nor hate, nor menace, nor anything less terrible than recognition". In an ironic twist, the ghost's testimony reveals she did not know who her murderer was and approached her husband "in the loving hope that he would be able to see her, smiling and consciously beautiful".&lt;ref name="gothic"/&gt; But the murderer, plagued by guilt, noticed only the strangulation marks he had left on her throat.

As [[Jack Sullivan (literary scholar)|Jack Sullivan]] pointed out, Bierce's story "achieves an almost mind-numbing complexity by emerging from three fragmented points of view".&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Jack. ''Elegant Nightmares: The English Ghost Story from Le Fanu to Blackwood''. Ohio University Press, 1978. {{ISBN|9780821403747}}. P. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; The truth can be deduced only from the combination of three accounts, because "each of the characters is missing some vital element of the picture".&lt;ref&gt;[[S. T. Joshi]]. ''The Weird Tale''. Wildside Press LLC, 2003. {{ISBN|9780809531226}}. P. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
"The Moonlit Road" has been cited as a template for "[[In a Grove]]", a short story by [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]] in which the murder of a Samurai is recounted by multiple witnesses and in the end, the victim gives deposition through a medium.&lt;ref name="DavisAnderson2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Blair Davis|author2=Robert Anderson|author3=Jan Walls|title=Rashomon Effects: Kurosawa, Rashomon and their legacies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VLXhCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT41|date=6 November 2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-57463-7|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Akira Kurosawa]] used this story as the basis for the plot of his famous film ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashōmon]]''.

In 2008, Bierce's short story was loosely adapted by [[Leor Baum]] as a 19-minute film titled "The Moonlit Road". In 2009, [[The Library of America]] selected this story for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of ''American Fantastic Tales'', edited by [[Peter Straub]].

'''''The Mystery of Oberwald''''' ({{lang-it|'''Il mistero di Oberwald'''}}) is a 1980 Italian drama film written, directed, and edited by [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] and starring [[Monica Vitti]], [[Paolo Bonacelli]], and Franco Branciaroli. Based on the 1946 play ''[[L'Aigle à deux têtes]]'' by [[Jean Cocteau]], the film is about a man who breaks into the castle at Oberwald to kill the queen but faints before doing so. The man's physical resemblance to the murdered king leads to a strange turn of events.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mystery of Oberwald |publisher=''Internet Movie Database'' |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081165/ |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Mystery of Oberwald'' received the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists Silver Ribbon in 1982.&lt;ref name="imdbawards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards for The Mystery of Oberwald |publisher=''Internet Movie Database'' |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081165/awards |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
During the nineteenth century, a young radical poet named Sebastian (Franco Branciaroli) breaks into an old dilapidated castle in Oberwald on a dark stormy night intending to kill the queen and free his country. The queen ([[Monica Vitti]]) has been in mourning for ten years for her husband the king who was assassinated on their wedding day. Sebastian, who faints before he can kill the queen, is the spitting image of the assassinated king. Sebastian and the queen talk, and the queen discovers that Sebastian once wrote a subversive poem that she liked, even though it was attacking her. The queen dares Sebastian to kill her, otherwise she vows to kill him.

==Reception==
Upon its theatrical release, ''The Mystery of Oberwald'' received generally negative reviews. In his review in ''The New York Times'', Vincent Canby called it "a movie that probably wouldn't last five minutes in front of an audience in control of its wits and with no more than a passing interest in Art for its own sake."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Canby |first=Vincent |title=Antonioni's 'The Mystery of Oberwald' |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=September 30, 1981 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/30/movies/antonioni-s-mystery-of-oberwald.html |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canby concluded, "The only thing that makes ''The Mystery of Oberwald'' bearable is watching the Italian director's attempts to use video color techniques that are supposed to make more dramatic a fairly conventional narrative."&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

On the review aggregator web site ''Rotten Tomatoes'', the film holds a 57% positive rating from critics based on 7 reviews, and a 35% positive audience rating based on 339 user ratings.&lt;ref name="rotten"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mystery of Oberwald |publisher=''Rotten Tomatoes'' |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mystery_of_oberwald/ |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Prince of Tides''''' is a 1991 American [[Romance film|romantic]] [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] based on the 1986 [[The Prince of Tides (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Pat Conroy]]; the film stars [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Nick Nolte]]. It tells the story of the narrator's struggle to overcome the psychological damage inflicted by his dysfunctional childhood in [[South Carolina]]. Streisand directed and produced the film in addition to starring in it. Conroy and Becky Johnston adapted the screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= A Mainstream `Prince of Tides |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1991-12-25|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1991-12-25/entertainment/ca-781_1_tom-wingo-barbra-streisand|accessdate=2010-11-12|first=Kenneth|last=Turan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]] including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], but lost the award to ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''.

==Plot==
Tom Wingo, a teacher and football coach from [[South Carolina]], is asked by his mother, Lila, to travel to [[New York City]] to help his twin sister's psychiatrist, Susan Lowenstein, after his sister Savannah's latest suicide attempt. Tom hates New York but reluctantly accepts, largely to take the opportunity to be alone and away from a life that does not satisfy him. During his initial meetings with Lowenstein, Tom is reluctant to disclose many details of their dysfunctional family's secrets. In flashbacks, Tom relates incidents from his childhood to Lowenstein in hopes of discovering how to save Savannah's life. The Wingo parents were an abusive father and a manipulative, status-hungry mother. The father was a shrimp boat operator and, despite being successful at that profession, spent all of his money on frivolous business pursuits, leaving the family in poverty.

Tom is also torn with his own problems but hides behind what he calls "the Southern way"; i.e. laughing about everything. For example, his wife Sallie is having an affair, and her lover wants to marry her. Tom and Lowenstein begin having feelings for each other. After Tom discovers that she is married to Herbert Woodruff, a famous concert violinist, Lowenstein introduces Tom to her son Bernard, who is being groomed to become a musician as well but who secretly wants to play football. Tom starts coaching Bernard along with attending sessions with Lowenstein to help his sister. Tom discovers that Savannah has been in such a [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociated state]] that she even had a different identity, Renata Halpern. As Halpern, she wrote books to disguise the Savannah side of her troubled life. Tom confronts Lowenstein over not revealing this information before, and they argue, during which she throws a dictionary at him. To apologize, she asks him to dinner, and their relationship becomes closer.

Tom has a fateful meeting with his mother and stepfather, bringing up painful memories. Tom reveals that, when he was 13 years old, three escaped convicts invaded his home and raped him, his mother, and his sister. His older brother, Luke, killed two of the aggressors with a shotgun, while his mother stabbed the third with a kitchen knife. They buried the bodies beneath the house and never spoke of it again. Tom bursts into tears, having now let loose a key piece of Savannah's troubled life. 

After discovering that Tom has been coaching Bernard, Herbert orders Bernard to stop his football pursuits, return to his music lessons, to prepare to leave for [[Tanglewood Music Center|Tanglewood]], a prestigious music academy. Tom is invited to a dinner at Lowenstein's home, along with poets and intellectuals. Herbert is overtly rude and reveals that Tom's sister is in therapy with his wife. Infuriated, Lowenstein voices her suspicions about her husband's affair. Tom takes Herbert's "million dollar" violin and threatens to throw it off the high-rise balcony unless Herbert apologizes.  Tom throws the violin in the air, Herbert nervously apologizes, and Tom catches the violin before it falls.  

Tom spends a romantic weekend with Lowenstein at her country house. Savannah recovers and is released from the hospital. This recovery is due to finally learning about things she has repressed from her childhood, most notably the rapes. Her first suicide attempt at age 13 was after the rapes and murders of the three convicts. Tom then receives a call from his wife, who has finally decided she wants him back. He loves both Lowenstein and his wife, and tells Lowenstein he doesn't love his wife more, "just longer". Tom ends his relationship with Lowenstein and reunites with his wife and family, but wishes that two lives could be given to each man and woman. He is happy in his renewed life, after finally working out the traumatic events in his past with Lowenstein's help. Tom thinks of her daily as he reaches the top of the bridge on his drive home from work. Her name comes to him as a kind of prayer, a blessing.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===

[[Pat Conroy]], author of the novel ''The Prince of Tides'', gave Streisand a copy of his novel with the inscription: "To Barbra Streisand: The Queen of Tides...you are many things, Barbra, but you're also a great teacher...one of the greatest to come into my life. I honor the great teachers and they live in my work and they dance invisibly in the margins of my prose. You've honored me by taking care of it with such great seriousness and love. Great thanks, and I'll never forget that you gave 'The Prince of Tides' back to me as a gift. Pat Conroy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/artists/C4104|title=SONGWRITERS FRIENDS |work=The Songwriters Hall of Fame |accessdate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Ebert gave the film three and 1/2 stars out of four, praising Streisand's directing. Ebert wrote, "By directing one good film, you prove that you had a movie inside of you. By directing two, you prove you are a real director". He called the film "an assured and very serious love story that allows neither humor nor romance to get in the way of its deeper and darker subject", adding that "Streisand shows herself as a director who likes emotional stories - but doesn't simplify them, and pays attention to the human quirks and strangeness of her characters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/prince-of-tides-1991|title=The Prince of Tides :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |work=Chicago Sun Times |accessdate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Variety'' wrote: "A deeply moving exploration of the tangled emotions of a dysfunctional Southern family, this lovingly crafted (though unevenly scripted) film of Pat Conroy’s novel centers on Nick Nolte’s performance of a lifetime. Bringing her usual strengths of character to her role as Nolte’s psychiatrist/lover, Barbra Streisand marks every frame with the intensity and care of a filmmaker committed to heartfelt, unashamed emotional involvement with her characters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117794146.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1|title=Review: ‘The Prince of Tides’|work=Variet |accessdate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Rosenbaum of the ''Chicago Reader'' wrote: "The results may seem overripe and dated in spots, but (Streisand) coaxes a fine performance out of Nolte, and the other actors (herself included) acquit themselves honorably".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-prince-of-tides/Film?oid=1048561|title=The Prince of Tides Reviews |work=Chicago Reader |accessdate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2018, ''The Prince of Tides'' holds a rating of 68% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 31 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/prince_of_tides&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
''The Prince of Tides'' was a critical and box office success, opening at number four with a grossing of $10,035,412 behind ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', and ''[[Father of the Bride (1991 film)|Father of the Bride]]'', and remained in the top 10 for seven weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Movies: 'Hook' leads with an estimated $23 million for the five-day Christmas period.

The film was among the [[1991 in film|top 20 highest-grossing movies of the year]] at the box office.

===Awards===
Although the film, its cast, and its crew received many nominations for Academy Awards, Best Director was not among these, while Best Picture was. At the following year's Oscar ceremonies, host [[Billy Crystal]] sang, to the tune of "Don't Rain on My Parade," "did this film direct itself? "&lt;ref name="lipper"&gt;Hal Lipper. "Oscars make moves beyond mainstream," ''St. Petersburg Times'', April 1, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, when ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' joined ''Prince of Tides'' and the previous year's ''[[Awakenings (film)|Awakenings]]'' in being nominated for the latter award, but not the former, [[Columbia Pictures]] president Mark Canton issued a statement, "This is unfortunately the third year in a row that Columbia has had a film nominated for Best Picture that seemingly directed itself."&lt;ref name="wire"&gt;Wire reports. "Film notes," ''Fort Worth Star-Telegram'', February 20, 1993, page 2D&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences from novel ==
While the film was a [[box office]] hit and raised Streisand's reputation as a director, its numerous changes from the original novel upset some Conroy purists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= RACADEMY AWARDS NOMINATIONS : Analysts See Merging of Art, Box-Office Appeal |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1992-02-20|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-20/entertainment/ca-3720_1_nominated-bugsy-and-jfk-beast|accessdate=2010-11-12|first=David J.|last=Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conroy and Johnston  eliminated most of the novel's flashback scenes. They describe Tom Wingo's relationship with his [[sibling]]s in great detail. In the novel, these flashbacks form the main plot and take up more of the novel than the romance between Streisand's character, Dr. Lowenstein, and Tom Wingo. The removal of the flashbacks makes the relationship between Wingo and Lowenstein the central story in the film, whereas in the novel, it is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Review/Film; 'Prince of Tides' Sidesteps Book's Pitfalls|work= The New York Times|date=1991-12-25|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/25/movies/review-film-prince-of-tides-sidesteps-book-s-pitfalls.html|accessdate=2010-10-26|first=Janet|last=Maslin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Prince Of Tides' Deserves Flow Of Oscar Nominations |work= [[The Morning Call|Morning Call]]|date=|url= http://articles.mcall.com/1991-12-27/features/2820373_1_tom-wingo-streisand-s-son-susan-lowenstein|accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Another character in the novel - the second Wingo brother, Luke, who appears only in flashbacks onscreen - is vitally important to the novel, and his death is a major plot point. In fact, the title of the book derives from a poem written by Savannah about Luke and his struggle against the government after the seizure of Colleton. In the film, "The Prince of Tides" is the title of a book of poetry written by Savannah and dedicated to Tom. Luke only appears intermittently, and his death is only vaguely described.

==Soundtrack==
Streisand initially hired English composer [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] to write a score for the film, but Barry eventually left due to creative differences. In a 7 March 1996 Cinemusic conference interview, Barry explained his exodus from the film, stating, "I was asked by Barbra Streisand to do ''The Prince of Tides'' &amp;ndash; I live in New York, she lives in Los Angeles &amp;ndash; and I went and met with her, and she showed me some footage, and she said, 'Why aren't you moving to Los Angeles?' and I said, 'Absolutely not.' And she said, 'Well, I like to know what's going on' &amp;ndash; Barbra's an extreme case, by the way &amp;ndash; and I said, 'Even if I did move to Los Angeles, I have no desire to meet with you once I know what I'm going to do. I can't work with someone over my shoulder, absolutely no way.'"&lt;ref&gt;Hoshowsky, Robert. [http://www.industrycentral.net/content/music/barry.shtml "John Barry; The Gstaad Memorandum"]. ''Industry Central'', 7 March 1996. Retrieved 20 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Barry later retitled his theme for ''The Prince of Tides'' "Moviola" and it was released on his 1992 movie theme album of the same name.&lt;ref name="Barbara Archives"&gt;[http://barbra-archives.com/record/albums/prince_of_tides.html "The Prince of Tides: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (1991)"]. ''Barbara-Archives.com''. Retrieved 20 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theme also appeared in Barry's 1995 score for the 3D [[IMAX]] film ''Across the Sea of Time'', retitled "Flight Over New York".

The final film score was composed by [[James Newton Howard]] and released 12 November 1991.&lt;ref name="Barbara Archives" /&gt;  It was well received by critics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Christian |last=Clemmensen |title=''The Prince of Tides'': (James Newton Howard) |date=6 February 2012 |url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/prince_tides.html |publisher=[[Filmtracks.com]] |accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and garnered Howard his first [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], though it lost to [[Alan Menken]]'s music for ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''. The soundtrack contains two songs by Streisand, although they did not appear in the film (one of those songs, "Places That Belong To You", was at one point intended for the film's end credits, but replaced with new music by Howard in the released version). The film also includes songs and music that do not appear on any soundtracks.

'''Transderivational search''' (often abbreviated to '''TDS''') is a [[psychology|psychological]] and [[cybernetics]] term, meaning when a search is being conducted for a [[fuzzy logic|fuzzy]] match across a broad field. In [[computing]] the equivalent function can be performed using [[content-addressable memory]].

Unlike usual searches, which look for literal (i.e. exact, [[logic]]al, or [[regular expression]]) matches, a transderivational search is a search for a possible meaning or possible  match as part of communication, and without which an incoming communication cannot be made any sense of whatsoever. It is thus an integral part of processing [[language]], and of attaching [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] to [[communication]].

A psychological example of TDS is in [[Milton Erickson|Ericksonian]] [[hypnotherapy]], where vague suggestions are used that the patient must process intensely in order to find their own meanings, thus ensuring that the practitioner does not intrude his own beliefs into the subject's inner world.

==TDS in human communication and processing==
Because TDS is a compelling, automatic and unconscious state of internal focus and processing (i.e. a type of everyday trance state), and often a state of internal lack of certainty, or openness to finding an answer (since something is being checked out at that moment), it can be utilized or interrupted, in order to create, or deepen, trance.

TDS is a fundamental part of human language and cognitive processing. Arguably, every word or utterance a person hears, for example, and everything they see or feel and take note of, results in a very brief trance while TDS is carried out to establish a contextual meaning for it.

===Examples===
'''Leading statements:'''

* ''"And those thoughts you had yesterday..."'' the human mind cannot process hearing this phrase, without at some level searching internally for some thoughts or other that it had yesterday, to make the subject of the sentence.
* ''"The many colors that fruit can be"'' likewise starts the human mind considering even if briefly, different fruit sorted by color.
* ''"You did it again, didn't you!"'' This everyday [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] use of TDS usually sends the recipient looking internally for some "it" they may have done for which blame is being fairly given. Regardless of whether such a matter can be identified, guilt or anger may result.
* ''"There has been pain, hasn't there"'' the mind of a patient suffering an illness will find it very hard or impossible to hear or answer this sentence without conducting internal searches to verify whether this is true or not, or to find an example if so.
* ''"You'd forgotten something [or: some part of your body], hadn't you?"'' the mind usually checks through the various things, or parts of the body, on hearing this, seeing if each in turn has been forgotten.

'''Textual ambiguity:'''
* ''"Do you remember line dancing on the steps?"'' Without sufficient context, some statements may trigger TDS in order to resolve inherent [[ambiguity]] in the interpretation of a posed question. Do I remember a bygone fad called "line dancing on the steps"? Do I remember personally engaging in dancing in the past? Do I remember my routine practice dancing by focusing on the steps of the dance? Do I tend to forget about dancing when I am standing on steps?
* ''"Penny-wise and pound the table dance to the beat of a different drummer"''. The mixing of [[cliché]] and stock phrases may trigger TDS in order to reconcile the discrepancies between expected and actual utterances in sequence.

Although TDS is often associated with spoken language, it can be induced in any perceptual system. Thus Milton Erickson's "[[Milton H. Erickson#Handshake induction|hypnotic handshake]]" is a technique that leaves the other person performing TDS in search of meaning to a deliberately ambiguous use of touch.

'''Turkish mafia''' ({{lang-tr|Türk mafyası}}) is the general term for criminal organizations based in [[Turkey]] and/or composed of (former) Turkish citizens. Crime groups with origins in Turkey are active throughout [[Western Europe]] (where a strong Turkish immigrant community exists) and the [[Middle East]]. Turkish criminal groups participate in a wide range of criminal activities, internationally the most important being [[drug trafficking]], especially [[heroin]]. In the trafficking of heroin they cooperate with [[Bulgarian mafia]] groups who transport the heroin further to countries such as [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="flarenetwork"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flarenetwork.org/report/enquiries/article/from_opium_to_heroin_turkeys_gold_mines.htm|title=From opium to heroin: Turkey's gold mines &amp;lt; Enquiries &amp;lt; REPORT &amp;lt; Flare Network|publisher=flarenetwork.org|accessdate=13 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623074449/http://www.flarenetwork.org/report/enquiries/article/from_opium_to_heroin_turkeys_gold_mines.htm|archivedate=23 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Criminal activities such as the trafficking of other types of drugs, illegal gambling, [[human trafficking]], [[prostitution]] or [[extortion]] are committed in Turkey itself as well as European countries with a sizeable Turkish community such as [[Germany]], [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

Turkish gangs and mafias also cooperate with some Laz, Zaza and Kurdish gangs. Some Turkish gangs accept non-Turkish members. Some Turkish crime syndicates have their origin in two regions: the Trabzon province on the Black Sea coast of northeastern Turkey and the East and Southeast Anatolia in the south of the country.

== History ==
The Turkish Mafia was involved in the weapons trade in the 2010s, and the heroin trade in the 2010s to present, and then moved along into human smuggling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dina Siegel|author2=H. Bunt|author3=D. Zaitch|title=Global Organized Crime: Trends and Developments|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bekir Celenk was one of the godfathers of the Turkish mafia and was involved in the plot to assassinate pope [[John Paul II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jongman|first1=Albert|title=Political Terrorism: A New Guide To Actors, Authors, Concepts, Data Bases, Theories, And Literature|pages=678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime groups ==
Criminal groups composed of [[Turkish people|Turks]] are active throughout the country and in communities with a large ethnically Turkish population. Certain Turkish criminal groups have strong links with corrupt politicians and corrupt members of the local law enforcement. They are active in different sections of organized crime and can often be linked to politically motivated groups, such as the [[Grey Wolves (organization)|Grey Wolves]]. This can especially be the case with criminals in immigrant Turkish communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.be/peteredel/aanvullingen/hoofdstuk_10/01_Corruptie_en_georganiseerde_misdaad_in_Turkije.php|title=Corruptie en georganiseerde misdaad in Turkije - aanvulling bij De diepte van de Bosporus|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powerful and important Turkish criminal organizations mostly have their origin in the [[Trabzon Province]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2007/01/31/01003-20070131ARTFIG90238-le_nationalisme_turc_prospere_a_trabzon.php|title=Le nationalisme turc prospère à Trabzon|work=Le Figaro|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporate members of both the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and the [[Laz people|Laz]] populations.

=== Laz crime groups ===
Even though crime groups composed of Turks come from all over the country, a relatively high amount of them have origins in the [[Black Sea]] region of Turkey. These groups consisting of [[Laz people]] and Turks are especially strong in the country itself.{{fact|date=November 2018}} Black Sea crime bosses such as [[Alaattin Çakıcı]] are known from having links to or being members of the politically motivated group [[Grey Wolves (organization)|Grey Wolves]].&lt;ref name="refworld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4b6fe305d.pdf|date=11 June 2009|title= Refugee Review Tribunal &amp;#124; AUSTRALIA RRT RESEARCH RESPONSE|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turkish Cypriot crime groups ===
Following the substantial immigration of [[Turkish Cypriots]] to [[London]] criminal gangs composed of Turkish Cypriots were formed in working-class neighborhoods. Mainly involved in [[drug trafficking]], [[armed robbery]], [[money laundering]] these crime clans have more in common with the traditional White British crime firms than with the Turkish mafia.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

=== Kurdish crime groups ===
Some ethnically [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] crime groups have their origin in the Southeast Anatolia part of Turkey. These groups are believed largely clan based and their main source of income is allegedly believed to be the trafficking of heroin and weapons. Some group of those leaders, such as [[Hüseyin Baybaşin]] had been active in Western European countries, especially [[Great Britain]]. Some Turkish sources have accused them to have links to the [[PKK]], but never confirmed by authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-L8B8ydtHZ4C&amp;pg=PA467 |title=Organized Crime|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zaza crime families in the United Kingdom ===
While ethnically [[Zaza people|Zaza]] groups are not noteworthy in Turkey itself, large Alevi Zaza immigrant communities have formed in [[Great Britain]] and [[Germany]]. Criminal gangs from these communities have links with other Turkish and Kurdish crime bosses and are involved in [[drug trafficking]] and [[contract killing]]. An example in [[London]] is the brutal turf war between Turkish gangs, such as the so-called ''Tottenham Boys'' and the ''Hackney Turks''. The Tottenham Boys and Hackney are mainly Turkish gangs, but they have also some Kurdish members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The SLAP that caused the feud that led to the London police shooting|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3357147/The-SLAP-led-Wood-Green-police-shooting-amazing-story-spiralling-Turkish-heroin-war-streets-London-left-bodies-strewn-Europe.html|accessdate=21 May 2016|work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-11325134|title=BBC News - Could Turkish and Kurdish gangs become new 'mafia'?|work=BBC News|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
