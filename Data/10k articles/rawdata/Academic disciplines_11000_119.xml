'''5-Oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid''' (i.e. 5-oxo-6''E'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid; also termed '''5-oxo-ETE''' and '''5-oxoETE''') is a [[Nonclassic eicosanoid]] metabolite of [[arachidonic acid]] and the most potent naturally occurring member of the [[5-HETE]] family of [[cell signaling]] agents.  Like other cell signaling agents, 5-oxo-ETE is made by a cell and then feeds back to stimulate its parent cell (see [[Autocrine signaling]]) and/or exits this cell to stimulate nearby cells (see [[paracrine signaling]]). 5-Oxo-ETE can stimulate various cell types particularly human [[leukocytes]] but possesses its highest potency and power in stimulating the human [[eosinophil]] type of leukocyte. It is therefore suggested to be formed during and to be an important contributor to the formation and progression of eosinophil-based allergic reactions;&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Powell WS, Rokach J | title = Biosynthesis, biological effects, and receptors of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and oxoeicosatetraenoic acids (oxo-ETEs) derived from arachidonic acid | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1851 | issue = 4 | pages = 340–55 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25449650 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.10.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cossette C, Gravel S, Reddy CN, Gore V, Chourey S, Ye Q, Snyder NW, Mesaros CA, Blair IA, Lavoie JP, Reinero CR, Rokach J, Powell WS | title = Biosynthesis and actions of 5-oxoeicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) on feline granulocytes | journal = Biochemical Pharmacology | volume = 96 | issue = 3 | pages = 247–55 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26032638 | doi = 10.1016/j.bcp.2015.05.009 | pmc=4830392}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is also suggested that 5-oxo-ETE may also contribute [[inflammation]], cancer cell growth, and other pathophysiological responses.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;

== Biochemistry and production ==
In the most common means for its production, cells make 5-oxo-ETE in a four step pathway that involves their stimulus-induced activation of the following pathway: '''a)''' the release of arachidonic acid (i.e. 5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid) from its storage sites in membrane [[phospholipids]] due to the activation of [[phospholipase A2]] enzymes; '''b)''' oxygenation of this arachidonic acid with by activated [[arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase]] (ALOX5) to form 5(''S'')-hydroperoxy-6''E'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid (5(''S'')-HpETE); '''c)''' reduction of this 5(''S'')-HpETE by ubiquitous cellular peroxidases to form 5(''S'')-hydroxy-6''E'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid (5(''S'')-HETE); and ('''d''') the oxidation of 5(''S'')-HETE by a [[microsome]]-bound [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate]] (NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)-dependent dehydrogenase enzyme viz., ([[5-Hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase]] or 5-HEDH) to form 5-oxo-ETE:&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;  
&lt;center&gt;
'''a)''' Phospholipid-bound arachidonic acid  → free arachidonic acid&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
'''b)''' Free arachidonic acid + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 5''(S'')-HpETE&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
'''c)''' 5''(S)''-HpETE → 5(''S'')-HETE&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
'''d)''' 5''(S)''-HETE + NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt; 5-oxo-ETE + NADPH&lt;/center&gt;

5-HEDH has little or no ability to metabolize the ''R'' [[stereoisomer]] of 5(''S'')-HETE viz., 5(''R'')-HETE, to 5-oxo-ETE.  Furthermore, it acts in a fully reversible manner, readily converting 5-oxo-ETE back to 5(''S'')-HETE. Since cells typically maintain very high levels of NADPH compared to their NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels, they generally have little or no ability to convert 5(''S'')-HEE to 5-oxo-ETE, and when confronted with 5-oxo-ETE rapidly metabolize it to 5(''S'')-HETE.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;  However, cells undergoing aging, senescence, [[apoptosis]], [[oxidative stress]], or other conditions that raise their levels of [[reactive oxygen species]] (e.g. [[superoxide]] anion, [[oxygen radicals]], and [[peroxides]]) either physiologically (e.g. human [[phagocytes]] engulfing bacteria) or pathologically (e.g. oxidatively challenged [[B-lymphocytes]]) use up NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, have low NADPH/NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ratios, and therefore readily convert 5(''S'')-HETE to 5-oxo-ETE.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt; Thus, many pathological conditions oxidative stress such as occurs in rapidly growing cancers may be important promoters of 5-oxo-ETE accumulation in vivo.

5-Oxo-ETE can also be made form either 5(''S'')-HpETE (and possibly 5(''R'')-HpEPE) by the action of [[cytochrome P450]] (CYP) enzymes such as [[CYP1A1]], [[CYP1A2]], [[CYP1B1]], and [[CYP2S1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bui P, Imaizumi S, Beedanagari SR, Reddy ST, Hankinson O | title = Human CYP2S1 metabolizes cyclooxygenase- and lipoxygenase-derived eicosanoids | journal = Drug Metabolism and Disposition | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 180–90 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21068195 | pmc = 3033693 | doi = 10.1124/dmd.110.035121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from 5(''S'')-HETE (and probably 5(''R'')-HETE) by the non-enzymatic attack with [[heme]] or various other dehydrating agents;&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt; It may also form by the conversion of 5-(''S'')-HpETE or 5(''R'')-HpETE to 5-oxo-ETE due to the action of a mouse [[macrophage]] 50-60 [[kilodalton]] cytosolic protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zarini S, Murphy RC | title = Biosynthesis of 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid from 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid in the murine macrophage | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 278 | issue = 13 | pages = 11190–6 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12547823 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M208496200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The contribution of the latter three pathways to the physiological production of 5-oxo-ETE has not been fully evaluated.

An isomer of 5-oxo-ETE, 5-oxo-(7''E'',9''E'',11''Z'',14''Z'')-eicosatetraenoic acid, forms non-enzymatically as a byproduct of hydrolyses of the 5-lipooxgenase metabolite, [[Leukotriene A4]].  This byproduct differs from 5-oxo-ETE not only in the position and geometry of its double bounds but also in its activity: it stimulates human neutrophils apparently by acting on one or more LTB4 receptors rather than OXER1.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Falgueyret J, Riendeau D | title = LTA(4)-derived 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid: pH-dependent formation and interaction with the LTB(4) receptor of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1484 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–8 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10685030 | doi = 10.1016/s1388-1981(99)00198-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tissue sources ==

=== Cellular production ===
Human [[neutrophil]]s, [[monocyte]]s, [[eosinophil]]s, [[B-lymphocyte]]s, [[dendritic cell]], [[platelets]], airway [[epithelial cell]]s and [[smooth muscle cell]]s, vascular [[endothelial cell]]s, and skin [[keratinocytes]] have been found and/or suggested to make 5-oxo-ETE from endogenous or exogenous 5-HETE, particularly under conditions of oxidative stress; cell lines derived from human cancers such as those from breast, prostate, lung, colon, and various types of leukemia have likewise been shown to be producers of 5-oxo-ETE.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;

=== Transcellular production ===
Cells of one type may release the 5(''S'')-HETE that they make to nearby cells of a second type which then oxidize the 5(''S'')-HETE to 5-oxo-ETE.  This '''transcellular production''' typically involves the limited variety of cell types that express active 5-lipoxygenase, lack HEDH activity because of their high levels of NADPH compared to NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels, and therefore accumulate 5(''S'')-HETE, not 5-oxo-ETE, upon stimulation; this 5(''S'')-ETE can leaves these cells, enter various cell types that possess 5-HEDH activity along with lower NADPH to NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels, and thereby is converted to 5-oxo-ETE.  This transcellular production of 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoates has been demonstrated '''in vitro''' with human neutrophils as the 5(''S'')-HETE producing cells and human [[PC-3]] prostate cancer cells, [[platelets]], and [[monocyte]]-derived [[dendritic cell]]s as the oxidizing cells.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Powell WS, Rokach J | title = The eosinophil chemoattractant 5-oxo-ETE and the OXE receptor | journal = Progress in Lipid Research | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 651–65 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24056189 | doi = 10.1016/j.plipres.2013.09.001 | pmc=5710732}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zimpfer U, Dichmann S, Termeer CC, Simon JC, Schröder JM, Norgauer J | title = Human dendritic cells are a physiological source of the chemotactic arachidonic acid metabolite 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid | journal = Inflammation Research | volume = 49 | issue = 11 | pages = 633–8 | date = November 2000 | pmid = 11131304 | doi = 10.1007/s000110050641 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is theorized that this transcellular metabolism occurs in vivo and provides a mechanism for controlling 5-oxo-ETE production by allowing it to occur or be augmented at sites were 5-lipoxygenase-containg cells congregate with cell types possessing 5-HEDH and favorable NADPH/NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ratios; such sites, it is theorized, might include those involving allergy, inflammation, oxidative stress, and rapidly growing cancers.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;

== Metabolism ==

As indicated in the previous section, 5-oxo-ETE is readily converted to 5(''S'')-HETE by 5-HEDH in cells containing very low NADPH/NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ratios. Human [[neutrophils]], an important model cell for investigating 5-oxo-ETE production, take up 5-oxo-ETE and reduce it to 5(''S'')-HETE; they also form appreciable amounts of 5(''S''),20-dihydroxy-ETE and small amounts of 5-oxo,20-hydroxy-ETE probably by the action of the ω-hydroxylase [[cytochrome P450]] enzyme, CYP453A on 5(''S'')-HETE and 5-oxo-ETE, respectively.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Taylor JS, Thomas MJ | title = Receptors for the 5-oxo class of eicosanoids in neutrophils | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 273 | issue = 49 | pages = 32535–41 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9829988 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.273.49.32535 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cells also incorporate the 5(''S'')-HETE product of 5-oxo-ETE but little or no 5-oxo-ETE itself as an [[ester]] into their various [[phospholipid]] and [[glycerolipid]] pools; however, isolated neutrophil [[plasma membrane]]s, which lack appreciable 5-HEDH activity, do esterify 5-oxo-ETE into these lipid pools.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Several other pathways can metabolize 5-oxo-ETE.  First, human [[eosinophils]] use [[Arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase]]-1 (or possibly [[Arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase-2]] to metabolize 5-oxo-ETE to 5-oxo-15-(''S'')-hydroperoxy-ETE which is rapidly reduced to 5-oxo-15(''S'')-hydroxy-ETE; 5-oxo-15(''S'')-hydroxyl-ETE is about one-third as potent as 5-oxo-ETE in stimulating cells.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt; Second, human platelets use [[12-lipoxygenase]] to metabolize 5-oxo-ETE to 5-oxo-12(''S'')-hydroperxy-eicosatetraenoat which is rapidly converted to 5-oxo-12(''S'')-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoate (5-oxo-12)''S'')-hydroxy-ETE); 5-oxo-12(''S'')-hydroxyl-ETE is a weak antagonist of 5-oxo-ETE.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt; Third, mouse [[macrophages]] use '''a)''' a [[cytochrome P450]] enzyme to metabolize 5-oxo-ETE to 5-oxo-18-hydroxy-ETE (5-oxo-18-HETE) which is either attacked by a 5-keto-reductase (possibly 5-HEDH) to form 5,18-dihydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (5,18-diHETE) or by a Δ6-reductase to form 5-oxo-18-hydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid (5-oxo-18-HETrE) which is then reduced by a 5-keto-reductase (possibly 5-HEDH) to 5,18-dihydroxy-eicosatetrienoic acid (5,18-diHETrE); '''b)''' a cytochrome P450 enzyme converts 5-oxo-ETE to 5-oxo-19-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-19-HETE) which is then either reduced by a keto reductase (possibly 5-HEDH) to 5,19-dihydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (5,19-diHETE) or by a Δ6 reductase to 5-oxo-19-hydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid (5-oxo-19-HETrE);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hevko JM, Bowers RC, Murphy RC | title = Synthesis of 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid and identification of novel omega-oxidized metabolites in the mouse macrophage | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 296 | issue = 2 | pages = 293–305 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11160610 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''c)''' leukotriene C4 synthase to metabolize 5-oxo-ETE to 5-oxo-7-glutathionyl-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid (FOG7).

== Mechanism of action ==

=== The OXER1 receptor ===
Studies in human neutrophils first detected a [[plasma membrane]]-localized site which reversibly bound 5-oxo-ETE and had the attributes of a [[Gi alpha subunit]]-linked [[G protein-coupled receptor]] based on the ability of 5-oxo-ETE to activate this class of membrane G proteins by a [[pertussis toxin]]-sensitive mechanism.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  Subsequently, this receptor was cloned by several groups who termed it the [[oxoeicosanoid receptor 1]] (OXER1), OXE, OXE-R, hGPCR48, HGPCR48, or R527 (its gene is termed ''OXE1'' or ''OXER1''), and found it coupled with and activated the [[G protein]] complex composed of the [[Gi alpha subunit]] (Gαi) and [[G beta-gamma complex]] (Gβγ).&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brink C, Dahlén SE, Drazen J, Evans JF, Hay DW, Rovati GE, Serhan CN, Shimizu T, Yokomizo T | title = International Union of Pharmacology XLIV.

=== Other GPCR receptors ===
Mouse MA-10 cells respond to 5-oxo-ETE but lack OXER1.  It has been suggested that these cells' responses to 5-oxo-ETE are mediated by an ortholog to OXER1, mouse [[niacin receptor 1]], Niacr1, which is a G protein-coupled receptor for [[niacin]], or, alternatively, by one or more of the mouse hydroxycarboxylic acid (HCA) family of the G protein-coupled receptors, HCA1 ([[GPR81]]), HCA2 ([[GPR109A]]), and HCA3 ([[GPR109B]]), which are G protein-coupled receptors for fatty acids.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23159987"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cooke M, Di Cónsoli H, Maloberti P, Cornejo Maciel F | title = Expression and function of OXE receptor, an eicosanoid receptor, in steroidogenic cells | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 371 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 71–8 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23159987 | doi = 10.1016/j.mce.2012.11.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PPARγ ===
5-Oxo-ETE and 5-oxo-15(''S'')-hydroxy-ETE but not 5-hydroxy members of the 5-HETE family such as 5-(''S'')-HETE activate [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma]] (PPARγ).  This activation does not proceed through OXER1; rather, it involves the direct binding of the oxo analog to PPARγ with 5-oxo-15-(''S'')-hydroxy-ETE being more potent than 5-oxo-ETE in binding and activating PPARγ.&lt;ref name="Biochim. Biophys 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Rogers LC, Paumi CM, Hantgan RR, Thomas LR, Clay CE, High K, Chen YQ, Willingham MC, Smitherman PK, Kute TE, Rao A, Cramer SD, Morrow CS | title = 5-Oxo-ETE analogs and the proliferation of cancer cells | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1736 | issue = 3 | pages = 228–36 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16154383 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2005.08.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Activation of OXER1 receptor and PPARγ by the oxo analogs can have opposing effects on cell function.  For example, 5-oxo-ETE-bound OXER1 stimulates whereas 5-oxo-ETE-bound PPARγ inhibits the proliferation of various types of human cancer cell lines; this results in 5-oxo-ETE and 5-oxo-15-(''S'')-HETE having considerably less potency than anticipated in stimulating these cancer cells to proliferate relative to the potency of 5-(''S'')-HETE, a relationship not closely following the potencies of these three compounds in activating OXER1.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biochim. Biophys 2005"/&gt;

=== Other mechanisms ===
5-Oxo-ETE relaxes pre-contracted human bronchi by a mechanism that does not appear to involve OXER1 but is otherwise undefined.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17499751"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morin C, Sirois M, Echave V, Gomes MM, Rousseau E | title = Relaxing effects of 5-oxo-ETE on human bronchi involve BK Ca channel activation | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 311–9 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17499751 | doi = 10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2007.03.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Target cells ==

=== Inflammatory cells ===
5-Oxo-ETE is a potent in vitro stimulator and/or enhancer of [[chemotaxis]] (i.e. directional migration) and, depending on the cell type, various other responses such as [[degranulation]] (i.e. release of granule-bound enzymes), oxidative metabolism (i.e. generation of [[reactive oxygen species]]), and production of mediators such as various arachidonic acid metabolites and [[platelet-activating factor]] in human eosinophils, [[basophil]]s, neutrophils, and [[monocyte]]s.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8906847"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sozzani S, Zhou D, Locati M, Bernasconi S, Luini W, Mantovani A, O'Flaherty JT | title = Stimulating properties of 5-oxo-eicosanoids for human monocytes: synergism with monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and -3 | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 157 | issue = 10 | pages = 4664–71 | date = November 1996 | pmid = 8906847 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the injection of 5-oxo-ETE into the skin of humans causes the local accumulation of circulating blood cells, particularly  eosinophils but also to lesser extents neutrophils and [[monocyte]]-derived [[macrophages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muro S, Hamid Q, Olivenstein R, Taha R, Rokach J, Powell WS | title = 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid induces the infiltration of granulocytes into human skin | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 112 | issue = 4 | pages = 768–74 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14564360 | doi = 10.1016/S0091-6749(03)01888-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The activity of 5-oxo-ETE on the two cell types known to be involved in allergy-based inflammation, eosinophils and basophils, suggests that it may be involved in promoting allergic reactions possibly by attracting through [[chemotaxis]] these cells to nascent sites of allergy and/or through stimulating these cells to release granule-bound enzymes, reactive oxygen species, or other promoters of allergic reactions.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;  5-Oxo-ETE's activity on human cells involved in non-allergic inflammatory diseases viz., neutrophils and monocytes, as well as its ability to attack these cell types to the skin of humans suggest that 5-oxo-ETE may also be involved in the broad category of non-allergic inflammatory diseases including those involving host defense against pathogens.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

=== Lung airway smooth muscle cells ===
5-Oxo-ETE contracts smooth muscle and organ-cultured bronchi isolated from guinea pigs but relaxes bronchi isolated from human lung; the relaxation of human bronchi caused by 5-oxo-ETE may not involve its OXER1.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17499751 | year = 2007 | author1 = Morin | first1 = C | title = Relaxing effects of 5-oxo-ETE on human bronchi involve BK Ca channel activation | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 311–9 | last2 = Sirois | first2 = M | last3 = Echave | first3 = V | last4 = Gomes | first4 = M. M. | last5 = Rousseau | first5 = E | doi = 10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2007.03.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These results suggest that 5-oxo-ETE is not directly involved in the [[bronchoconstriction]]) that occurs in eosinophil-based allergic [[asthma]] reactions in humans.

=== Cancer cells ===
5-Oxo-ETE (or other 5-HETE family member) stimulates the growth and/or survival of human cell lines derived from cancers of the prostate, breast, lung, ovary, colon and pancreas&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biochim.

=== Steroidogenic cells ===
5-oxo-ETE stimulates human [[H295R]] adrenocortical cells to increase transcription of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein messenger RNA and produce [[aldosterone]] and [[progesterone]] by an apparent OXER1-dependent pathway.&lt;ref name="pmid23159987"/&gt;

== Interaction with other stimuli ==
5-Oxo-ETE and another potential mediator of human allergic reactions, [[platelet-activating factor]], act in [[synergy]] in stimulating human eosinophils and neutrophils: the combined agents elicit responses that are greater than the simple sum of their individual actions and do so at relatively low.&lt;ref name="pmid8683135"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Kuroki M, Nixon AB, Wijkander J, Yee E, Lee SL, Smitherman PK, Wykle RL, Daniel LW | title = 5-Oxo-eicosatetraenoate is a broadly active, eosinophil-selective stimulus for human granulocytes | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 157 | issue = 1 | pages = 336–42 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8683135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7803484"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Cordes JF, Lee SL, Samuel M, Thomas MJ | title = Chemical and biological characterization of oxo-eicosatetraenoic acids | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1201 | issue = 3 | pages = 505–15 | date = December 1994 | pmid = 7803484 | doi = 10.1016/0304-4165(94)90083-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 5-Oxo-ETE also greatly increases the potencies of [[complement component 5a]], [[LTB4]], and [[FMLP]] in stimulating human eosinophils to degranulate and its degranulating activity is greatly increase by pretreating human eosinophils with [[granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor]] or human neutrophils with either the latter [[cytokine]] or with [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]], [[tumor necrosis factor α]], or various [[nucleotides]] including [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name="pmid8683135"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7803484"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Kuroki M, Nixon AB, Wijkander J, Yee E, Lee SL, Smitherman PK, Wykle RL, Daniel LW | title = 5-Oxo-eicosanoids and hematopoietic cytokines cooperate in stimulating neutrophil function and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 271 | issue = 30 | pages = 17821–8 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8663432 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.271.30.17821 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Cordes JF | title = Human neutrophil degranulation responses to nucleotides | journal = Laboratory Investigation; A Journal of Technical Methods and Pathology | volume = 70 | issue = 6 | pages = 816–21 | date = June 1994 | pmid = 8015286 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pretreament of eosinophils with [[interleukin 5]] (a key mediator in eosinophil activation) also increases their in vitro chemotactic response to 5-oxo-ETE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guilbert M, Ferland C, Bossé M, Flamand N, Lavigne S, Laviolette M | title = 5-Oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid induces important eosinophil transmigration through basement membrane components: comparison of normal and asthmatic eosinophils | journal = American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 97–104 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10385597 | doi = 10.1165/ajrcmb.21.1.3517 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 5-Oxo-ETE also acts in synergy with two [[chemokines]], [[CCL2]] and [[CCL8]], in stimulating monocyte chemotaxis.&lt;ref name="pmid8906847"/&gt;  The interactions of 5-oxo-ETE with these mediators of allergy (e.g. platelet-activating factor, interleukin 5) in eosinophils further suggests that it plays a role in allergic diseases while its interactions with mediators of inflammatory reactions (e.g. tumor necrosis factor α, the colony stimulating factors, and the two CCL chemokines) in neutrophils and monocytes further suggest that it plays a role in inflammatory responses and host defense mechanisms.

== Clinical significance ==
Essentially all of the studies on 5-oxo-ETE's activities and target cells, similar to those on other members of the 5(''S'')-HETE family of agonists, are best classified as [[pre-clinical development]] studies: they have not yet been determined to be important in human pathophysiology. [[Translation studies]] are needed to learn if the preclinical studies implicating 5-Oxo-ETE and other 5(''S'')-HETE family members in allergic diseases, inflammatory diseases, cancer, steroid production, bone remodeling, parturition, and other pathophysiological events, as outlined here and on the [[5-HETE]] page, are relevant to humans and therefore of clinical significance.

'''''Anoigmaichnus''''' is an [[ichnogenus]] of [[bioclaustration]]s (a type of [[trace fossil]]). ''Anoigmaichnus'' includes shafts perpendicular to their hosts' growth surfaces or tilted
(up to 45°); conical to cylindrical; circular to oval cross-sections; lacking separate wall. Their apertures are elevated above their hosts' growth surfaces, forming short chimney-like structures. ''Anoigmaichnus'' is the world's earliest known macroscopic endobiotic symbiont and it may have been a [[parasite]]. It occurs in the Middle [[Ordovician]] [[bryozoa]]ns of

The '''Barbary Coast''' was a [[red-light district]] during the second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries in [[San Francisco]] which featured dance halls, concert saloons, bars, jazz clubs, variety shows, and brothels.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Asbury, Herbert. ''The Barbary Coast: An Informal History of the San Francisco Underworld''. New York: Basic Books, 2002, p.104.&lt;/ref&gt; Its nine block area was centered on a three block stretch of Pacific Street, now Pacific Avenue, between Montgomery and Stockton Streets. Pacific Street was the first street to cut through the hills of San Francisco, starting near [[Portsmouth Square]] and continuing east to the first shipping docks at Buena Vista Cove.

The Barbary Coast was born during the [[California Gold Rush|California Gold Rush of 1849]], when the population of San Francisco was growing at an exponential rate due to the rapid influx of tens of thousands of miners trying to find gold.  The early decades of the Barbary Coast would be marred by persistent lawlessness, [[gambling]], administrative graft, [[Frontier justice|vigilante justice]], and [[prostitution]];&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; however with the passage of time the city's government would gain strength and competence, and the Barbary Coast's maturing entertainment scene of [[dance hall]]s and [[jazz]] clubs would influence American culture.&lt;ref name="auto12"/&gt; The Barbary Coast's century-long evolution would pass through many substantial incarnations due to the city's rapid cultural development during the transition to the 20th century. Its former location is now overlapped by [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]], [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]], and [[Jackson Square, San Francisco|Jackson Square]].

== Gold Rush and a first decade ==
[[Image:SanFrancisco1851a.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|[[Portsmouth Square]], looking north to [[Telegraph Hill, San Francisco|Telegraph Hill]], 1851.]]
San Francisco's Barbary Coast arose from the massive infusion of treasure hunters, called [[Gold Rush of 1849#Forty-niners|''49-ers'']], seeking their fortunes by panning for gold as they searched for a potential gold mine.

=== Gold Rush of 1849 ===
{{Main|Gold Rush of 1849}}
Before the [[Gold Rush of 1849]] there were only a few hundred people living in tents and wooden shanties within [[San Francisco]]. However, after the gold rush the population of San Francisco would increase fifty-fold in just two years—from 492 in 1847 to over 25,000 in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hgpop.htm |title=San Francisco Population |accessdate=February 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004055802/http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hgpop.htm |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }} ''San Francisco Population'', SFgenealogy, 2014, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; That extreme growth combined with a lack of strong government would create many opportunities for criminals, corrupt politicians, and brothel owners.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Secrest, William: Dark and Tangled Threads of Crime – San Francisco's Famous Police Detective, Isaiah W. Lees, Quill Driver Books, 2004, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; For many decades murderers and robbers could commit their crimes without punishment, sometimes boldly in public view. As a result, the Barbary Coast became a wild area representative of the [[Old west|Old West]], and had many problems with political corruption, gambling, crime, and violence.

Around 1848 a group of volunteers from the [[Mexican–American War]] were eventually discharged and settled in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them were from [[New York City]] gangs from the [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]] and [[Bowery]] districts. About sixty of them organized into a gang called the ''Hounds'', paraded around as if they were military, and even creating a headquarters named Tammany Hall within a tent on Kearney Street.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Lukas 2010, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849, these thugs began to call themselves the ''Regulators'' as they harassed Mexicans and those of Spanish origin, and extorted money from local businesses for protection services.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Anyone who would not pay was likely to lose a nose, ear, or suffer greater bodily injury. However, after a group of 230 men organized into a militia and confronted the Hounds with possible arrest, they quickly fled from San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sydney Town ===
The Hounds was not the only group of criminals to set up business on San Francisco's Barbary Coast. By the end of 1849, several ships from [[Australia]] brought former members of [[Great Britain]]'s penal colony – including ex-convicts, [[ticket of leave|ticket-of-leave]] men, and criminals – to San Francisco, where they would become known as the ''[[Sydney Ducks]]''.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Montanarelli 2005, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; These Australian immigrants had become so numerous that they dominated the neighborhood.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; They opened boarding houses and various types of groggeries which had prostitutes affiliated with their businesses.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Pryor 2002, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; People who entered these groggeries and brothels were frequently later beaten and robbed.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

A newspaper of the day, the San Francisco Herald, states of Sydney Town:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The upper part of Pacific Street, after dark, is crowded by thieves, gamblers, low women, drunken sailors, and similar characters...  Unsuspecting sailors and miners are entrapped by the dexterous thieves and swindlers that are always on the lookout, into these dens, where they are filled with liquor – drugged if necessary, until insensibility coming upon them, they fall an easy victim to their tempters... When the habitues of this quarter have a reason to believe a man has money, they will follow him for days, and employ every device to get him into their clutches... These dance-groggeries are outrageous nuisances and nurseries of crime.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When looting San Francisco's neighborhoods, the Sydney Ducks even set fire to San Francisco six times between 1849 and 1851 in order to distract citizens from their pillaging and murdering.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Whenever they planned to start a fire, they waited for south westerly winds so that Sydney Town would not also catch fire. The citizens of San Francisco became enraged and in 1851 they formed a first Vigilance Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the Sydney Ducks, Samuel Whittaker and Robert McKenzie, were then arrested for arson, robbery, and burglary. The vigilantes then held a quick trial, and later hanged them.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor 2002, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vigilante]]s, unauthorized individuals who use trials and lynchings to punish criminals, were not uncommon in the [[Old west|Old West]] but San Francisco's Vigilance Committees were the largest and most organized of America's history.&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Michael: Inside Secret Societies – What They Don't Want You to Know, Citadel Press Books, 2005, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; The hangings scared the remaining Sydney Ducks into fleeing the city. Within two weeks after the hangings, Sidney Town had but only a few dance halls, saloons, and brothels remaining.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; That relative peace would only last for two years before criminals started to once again return to the Barbary Coast.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Lukas 2010, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

=== More vigilante justice ===
In the latter half of the 19th century, San Francisco saw administrative graft, boss politics, and a persistent lawlessness.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;Boyd 1997, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; For a while after the hangings of Whittaker and McKenzie, San Francisco functioned as a law-abiding city.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; The hangings frightened corrupt judges and government officials, who then began to do their duties with a rare diligence, not seen so far in San Francisco. This new competency in government would not last long, and by 1852 corrupt government officials developed a system of high salaries and expensive projects with political kickbacks that would drain the city's treasury to near bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; This financial crisis at city hall would create a great strain on commerce and also affect individual businesses.

The looting of the city's treasury could not have happened without the help of the most powerful man in San Francisco, [[David Broderick]], who was a state senator and held tight control over San Francisco from 1851 until his death in 1859.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt; Broderick's corruption was such that no man could be elected to public office unless he made a deal with Broderick to share half the profits from his office.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these backroom deals, Broderick accumulated a large amount of wealth which further strengthened his position as a powerful city boss. As news of the treasury's financial crisis became known, another even larger uprising of enraged citizenry would occur.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt;

James King, a popular journalist and publisher, vehemently protested the administrative graft of Broderick which angered one of Broderick's biggest supporters, a supervisor named James Casey. While King was standing in front of his newspaper's building Casey shot King in the chest, causing a mortal wound which would ultimately launch the formation of a second Vigilance Committee in May 1856.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; Within two hours after Casey's shooting of King, a mob of 10,000 people surrounded the jail where Casey was being held.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, pp. 86 - 87&lt;/ref&gt; The vigilantes then demanded that the jail release James Casey into their custody, and the badly out-numbered jail guards acquiesced to their demands.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, pp. 90-91&lt;/ref&gt; King died six days after being shot, and subsequently Casey was put on trial by the Vigilance Committee. King's funeral attracted over 15,000 people, but by the time the funeral had ended Casey had already been convicted and hanged by the vigilantes.&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;Asbury 1933, pp. 92-93&lt;/ref&gt; Now energized by wide public support, the Vigilance Committee set up shop in a large building near the wharf which included jail cells, court rooms, a surrounding wall to resist any military intervention, and was nicknamed Fort Gunnybags.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt; During the two months that followed the hanging of Casey there was not a single murder in San Francisco, and less than a half dozen robberies.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1856 the vigilance committee decided to disband and give control back to the elected officials.

== District defined ==
It was not until the 1860s when sailors gave the district its name, and began to refer to it as the ''Barbary Coast''.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Malcolm: More San Francisco Memoirs,1852-1899  – The Ripening Years, Londonborn Publications, 1996, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Barbary Coast' is borrowed from the [[Barbary Coast|Barbary Coast of North Africa]] where [[Barbary pirates|local pirates]] and [[Slavery on the Barbary Coast|slave traders]] launched raids on nearby coastal towns and vessels. That African region was also notorious for the same kind of predatory [[Dive bar|dives]] which would target sailors, as had been done on San Francisco's Barbary Coast.&lt;ref&gt;WPA Guide 2011, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Miners, sailors, and sojourners hungry for female companionship and bawdy entertainment continued to stream into San Francisco in the 1850s and 1860s, becoming the Barbary Coast's primary clientele. During its early days [[San Francisco]] had become a "wide" open city where police had little to no control in stopping the activities of gambling, drinking, drugs, drag, and [[prostitution]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kitchin|first=Rob|title=Sexing the city: The sexual production of non-heterosexual space in Belfast, Manchester and San Francisco|url=http://rsa.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1360481022000011155?needAccess=true|journal=City|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=205–218|doi=10.1080/1360481022000011155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that [[San Francisco]] functioned as a port city meant that it was able to sustain large transient populations that were less likely to conform to social rules and regulations.

=== Before the 1906 earthquake ===
During this time San Francisco went through much commercial growth and became an important shipping port, but matured to a level which would forbid any more uprisings by [[vigilante]]s.&lt;ref name="auto10"&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Without the threat of vigilante justice, corruption and crime begin to return along with predatory [[Dive bar|dives]] similar to those of Sidney Town.&lt;ref name="auto10"/&gt; The Barbary Coast would continue to build on its notorious reputation as a lawless city.&lt;ref&gt;Montanarelli 2005, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; With only one hundred policemen as of 1871, San Francisco had a severe shortage of law enforcement. At that time Police Chief Crowley said in his annual report that there was only one officer for every 1,445 inhabitants, while [[New York City]] had one in 464 and [[London]] had one for every 303 residents.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Entertaining the miners, entrepreneurs, and sailors would be a huge business and resulted in varied, inventive, and occasionally bizarre forms of entertainment.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; Except for a couple of restaurants, that three block stretch of Pacific Street was almost wall to wall with drinking establishments.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; They included dance halls, concert saloons which had entertainment and dancing, melodeons, cheap groggeries, and ''deadfalls'' which were dismal beer and wine dens. Initially the melodeons had mechanical [[Pump organ|reed organs]] which played music, however they quickly transformed into a kind of [[cabaret]] which had theatrical entertainment but no dance floor.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; The only women allowed in the melodeons were the waitresses and performers. Their shows usually contained songs, bawdy skits, and often featured [[can-can]] dancers. The deadfalls were the lowest of the establishments and had hard benches, damp sawdust on the floors, the bar was rough boards laid atop of barrels, had no entertainment, and their wine was often raw alcohol with an added coloring.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Coast'' as it was called, also invented its own kind of dance hall, called a [[Taxi dance hall#Barbary Coast dance hall|Barbary Coast Dance Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;Cressey 1932, p.179&lt;/ref&gt; It was different than most dance halls in that the only women there were the female employees who were paid to dance with the customers, and received commissions on the drinks that they could encourage their male customers to buy. Lawlessness was so bad in the Barbary Coast district that police did not patrol alone, but chose to walk their beats in pairs and sometimes in groups. There was usually a murder every night and scores of robberies.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; And even while inside drinking establishments, a customer's property and life were still never safe.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Prostitution was so common on the Barbary Coast that it was referred to as ''the Paris of America''. Drug addicts of the district could even buy [[cocaine]] or [[morphine]] at an all night [[Grant Avenue|Grant Street]] drugstore for only two or three times the price of a beer.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1890s, San Francisco hit its peak alcohol consumption in having over 3000 licensed bars, and another 2000 unlicensed bars.&lt;ref&gt;Lukas 2010, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;

The waitresses were a major attraction for the saloons and were nicknamed the ''pretty waiter girls'', though they were not always attractive or young.&lt;ref&gt;Montanarelli 2005, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; They were scantily clothed in gaudy outfits while they sold drinks and danced with customers for money.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; The saloons hired women to exploit the men, instructed to pick customers' pockets and then give half that money back to the management.&lt;ref name="auto11"&gt;Boyd 1997, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; The pretty waiter girls earned about $20 per week plus a commission on any drinks and dances that they sold. Small grog houses and deadfalls hired only handful of pretty waiter girls, but the larger dance halls and concert saloons employed up to fifty women.&lt;ref name="auto11"/&gt; However some of the concert saloons, like the Eureka and Bella Union, made an effort to have notable Barbary Coast performers appear in their shows and actually had attractive women for their pretty waiter girls.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not unusual for the pretty waiter girls to put drugs into the customers' drinks, so they could later be more easily robbed and sometimes clubbed unconscious.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Sailors, who were frequently the targets of the pretty waiter girls, had cause to dread the area because the art of [[shanghaiing]] was perfected here. Many a sailor woke up after a night's leave to find himself unexpectedly on another ship bound for some faraway port. The verb to "[[Shanghaiing|shanghai]]" was first coined on the Barbary Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p.199&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After the 1906 earthquake ===
{{Main|Terrific Street}}
Most of the buildings on that stretch of Pacific Street were destroyed by the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|earthquake and fire of 1906]]. However the city's financial boosters then saw an opportunity to clean up the tone of the Barbary Coast, and transform it into an entertainment area which would be acceptable for every-day San Franciscans. Possessing a new sense of civic pride, the boosters invested heavily in reconstruction and within three months over a dozen dance halls and a dozen bars were rebuilt and operating.&lt;ref name="auto12"&gt;Boyd 1997, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; This new incarnation of Pacific Street would be gentrified and tame compared to the lawless pre-earthquake version of the Barbary Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Montanarelli 2005, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; However prostitution still persisted in the district and it was not until 1917 that Mayor James Rudolf made a declaration that he would close every brothel in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p.309&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex [[Prostitution]] and entertainment which featured [[female impersonators]] briefly existed in a bar on the Barbary Coast as early as the spring of 1908 when ''The Dash'' opened on Pacific Street. The Dash employed some female impersonators, and patrons could purchase homosexual sex in its booths.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; The Dash closed near the end of that same year.

The thriving district also got a new nickname, ''Terrific Street''. The term "Terrific Street" was first used by musicians in describing the quality of music at the Pacific Street clubs, and indeed the first [[jazz]] clubs of San Francisco would occur on Terrific Street and attract national talents like [[Sophie Tucker]], Sid LeProtti, and [[Jelly Roll Morton]].&lt;ref name="auto13"&gt;Fleming, E.J.: Carole Landis – A Tragic Life in Hollywood, McFarland &amp; Company, 2005, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this time that the Barbary Coast gained a wider appeal and its large dance halls drew tremendous crowds.&lt;ref name="auto12"/&gt;

The principal attraction of Terrific Street was dancing and many nationally known dance steps like the [[Texas Tommy (dance)|Texas Tommy]] and the [[Turkey trot (dance)|Turkey Trot]], would be invented on Terrific Street.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; At night, its brightly lit block could be seen from across the bay in Oakland despite the fact that neon lights had not yet been invented.&lt;ref name="auto13"/&gt; From the seeds of cheap [[Mining town|mining-town]] amusements of the old Barbary Coast, Terrific Street would bloom as a vibrant and glamorous district which also nurtured the beginnings of arguably America's greatest cultural contribution, [[Jazz|jazz music]].&lt;ref name="auto12"/&gt;

=== Demise ===
An extreme shift in political policy came about in 1911 when a new mayor, [[James Rolph|James "Sunny Jim" Rolph]], was elected to the first of ten terms. Rolph, along with a new group of city supervisors and the business sector, was committed to reforming the Barbary Coast district.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; Just before election time in September 1913, [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s newspaper the [[The San Francisco Examiner|''Examiner'']], started a major crusade against the Barbary Coast and in a full page editorial suggested that it "should be wiped out."&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten days later the Police Commission adopted resolutions that no dancing would be allowed in any establishment of the district which served alcohol, that no women – employees or patrons – would be permitted in any saloon of the district, and that even electric signs would be forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, some drinking establishments fired their female employees and became ''straight saloons'', while others closed their businesses. Some of the larger dance halls moved to other districts and managed to survive for several more years by masquerading as dance academies or [[Taxi dance hall#Closed dance hall|''closed dance halls'']], but they never regained their previous popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey 1932, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WPA Guide 2011, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 the brothels were eventually closed down due to the [[Red Light Abatement Act]], but by that time all the excitement of Terrific Street had long since vanished.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Red Light Abatement Act, prostitution zones and prostitutes were forced to outskirt areas such as the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|Tenderloin]] and [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]] as shopping centers took over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wide-Open Town: a history of queer San Francisco to 1965|last=Boyd|first=Nan Alamilla|publisher=Univ of California Press|year=2003|isbn=9780520244740|location=|pages=25–62|quote=|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later eras of the Pacific Street District ==

=== International Settlement ===

{{Main|International Settlement (San Francisco)}}
When [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] was adopted in 1920 and stopped the flow of alcohol to the bars, Terrific Street's block lost much excitement and its dance halls and concert saloons were gradually replaced by offices, hotels, and warehouses. However, after Prohibition was repealed in 1933 and liquor was again available, an attempt was made to revive its entertainment scene. The police commission quashed these efforts when, on February 27, 1934, it announced that no dance permits for the area would be issued. This action followed "the withdrawal by the California state board of equalization of state liquor permits for the district." Protests by women's groups and church organizations influenced these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "Dull Future Faced By BarBary Coast", ''The San Bernardino Daily Sun'', San Bernardino, California, Wednesday 28 February 1934, Volume 40, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Still later, during World War II, in an attempt to revitalize the district, it was renamed [[International Settlement (San Francisco)|International Settlement]], and a pair of large promotional arched overhead signs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sflib1.sfpl.org:82/search?/dDistricts+--+International+Settlement./ddistricts+international+settlement/-3,-1,0,E/2exact&amp;FF=ddistricts+international+settlement&amp;1,6, Districts -- International Settlement. -- Historical Photographs - SF Public Library]&lt;/ref&gt; which read, ''International Settlement'', were constructed on either end of that Pacific Street block.&lt;ref&gt;[http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v470/bananaphone5000/GoGoGorilla5/SF-1-24-43-InternationalSettlement.jpg SF-1-24-43-InternationalSettlement.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way that the post-Barbary Coast establishments of Terrific Street attempted to draw customers and tourists with a reference to the Coast's nefarious past before the earthquake, International Settlement also tried to also draw tourists with a reference to that lost era.

=== The Broadway Scene ===
[[File:Oscar Peterson - 1950.JPG|right|thumb| 150px | Jazz pianist, composer, and vocalist &lt;br&gt;Oscar Peterson]]
{{Main|North Beach, San Francisco}}
During the latter half of the 20th century, the entertainment scene and dancing would spread one block north to Broadway, which is parallel to Pacific Street. [[Jazz|Jazz clubs]] were everywhere on Broadway during the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="auto14"/&gt; Some of Broadway's more famous clubs of that era included Basin Street West, Ann's nightclub, Mr. D's, El Matador, Sugar Hill, [[Keystone Korner]], the [[hungry i]], and the [[Jazz Workshop]].&lt;ref name="auto14"&gt;Feinstein 2012, p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. D's club, so named because [[Sammy Davis, Jr.|Sammy Davis Jr.]] was a partial owner, presented performances by [[Tony Bennett]] and rhythm and blues legend [[James Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2008, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; At Ann's nightclub legendary shock comedian [[Lenny Bruce]] received his start in [[standup comedy]] and created a sensation which drew the attention of journalist [[Herb Caen]] and Beat poets like [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]].&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2008, p. 295-296&lt;/ref&gt; Basin Street West started out as a jazz club but later hosted [[Otis Redding]], [[Ike and Tina Turner]], and  Lenny Bruce.&lt;ref name="auto14"/&gt; The [[hungry i]] club was a premier showcase of new talent and presented early performances of comedians [[Phyllis Diller]] and [[Woody Allen]], as well as vocalist [[Barbra Streisand]] when she was 19 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2008, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; The El Matador club became very popular by booking pricey acts like [[Oscar Peterson]], and its audience occasionally included celebrities such as [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Marilyn Monroe]].&lt;ref name="auto14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2008, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jazz Workshop]] became the premier club to hear jazz during the 1950s and 1960s when legendary musicians like [[Miles Davis]], [[Cannonball Adderley]], and [[John Coltrane]] would perform there.&lt;ref name="auto15"&gt;Richards 2008, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; Comedian [[Lenny Bruce]] made headlines and would open a national discussion on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s freedom of speech rights when he was arrested at the Jazz Workshop for using profanity in his comedy act.&lt;ref name="auto15"/&gt; When [[strip club]]s started to arrive on Broadway, some local jazz musicians working in the strip clubs would sit in and perform after hours at the jazz clubs.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein 2012, p. xxiv&lt;/ref&gt; LGBT entertainments of female impersonators also appeared in North Beach at a nightclub called ''[[Finocchio's Club|Finocchio's]]'', which opened in 1929.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Queer Sites: Gay Urban Histories Since 1600|last=Higgs|first=David|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-415-15897-8|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bar was opened by Joseph Finocchio and was on Stockton Street.

[[International Settlement (San Francisco)|International Settlement]]'s club acts, with their [[Can-can|can-can dancers]] and old-fashioned chorus girls, were unable to compete with the incredible talent and excitement of the emerging Broadway scene, and by the early 1960s their popularity had fallen below a critical level. But despite the brilliance and innovation of Broadway's entertainment scene of the 1950s and 1960s, its live entertainment clubs would also lose their popularity with time. As of the first decade in the 21st century, Broadway had lost its [[standup comedy]] clubs and its live music clubs, only to be replaced by cocktail lounges with recorded music. However, some live music clubs still operate in other areas of [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]].

{{Environment sidebar}}  

A '''biophysical  environment''' is a [[life|biotic]] and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] surrounding of an [[organism]] or [[population]], and consequently includes the factors that have an influence in their survival, development, and evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Biology online| title=''Environment. Definition''| url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Environment| accessdate=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biophysical environment can vary in scale from [[microscopic]] to global in extent. It can also be subdivided according to its attributes. Examples include the [[marine environment]], the [[atmospheric environment]] and the [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The term ''[[:wikt:environment|environment]]'' can refer to a singular global environment in relation to [[human]]ity, or a local biophysical environment, e.g. the UK's [[Environment Agency]].

==Life-environment interaction==
All life that has survived must have adapted to conditions of its environment. Temperature, light, humidity, soil nutrients, etc., all influence any species, within any environment. However life in turn modifies, in various forms, its conditions. Some long term modifications along the history of our planet have been significant, such as the incorporation of [[oxygen]] to the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. This process consisted in the breakdown of [[carbon dioxide]] by [[anaerobic microorganism]]s that used the carbon in their [[metabolism]] and released the [[Atmospheric chemistry|oxygen to the atmosphere]]. This led to the existence of oxygen-based plant and animal life, the [[great oxygenation event]]. Other interactions are more immediate and simple, such as the smoothing effect that forests have on the temperature cycle, compared to neighboring unforested areas.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[Environmental science]] is the study of the interactions within the biophysical environment. Part of this [[Branches of science|scientific discipline]] is the investigation of the [[effect of human activity on the environment]]. [[Ecology]], a sub-discipline of biology and a part of environmental sciences, is often mistaken as a study of human induced effects on the environment. [[Environmental studies]] is a broader [[academic discipline]] that is the systematic study of interaction of humans with their environment. It is a broad field of study that includes the [[natural environment]], [[built environment]]s and [[social environment]]s.

Environmentalism is a broad social and philosophical movement that, in a large part, seeks to minimise and compensate the negative effect of human activity on the biophysical environment. The issues of concern for environmentalists usually relate to the natural environment with the more important ones being [[climate change]], [[species]] [[extinction]], [[pollution]], and [[old growth forest]] loss.

One of the studies related include employing Geographic Information Science to study the biophysical environment.&lt;ref&gt;Deng, Y. X., and J. P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7670">'''Calspan Corporation''' is a science and technology company founded in 1943 as part of the Research Laboratory of the [[Curtiss-Wright]] Airplane Division at [[Buffalo, New York]]. Calspan consists of four primary operating units: Flight Research, Transportation Research, Aerospace Sciences [Transonic Wind Tunnel], and Crash Investigations. The company's main facility is in [[Cheektowaga (town), New York|Cheektowaga, New York]], while it has other facilities such as the Flight Research Center in [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and remote flight test operations at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California, and [[Patuxent River]], [[Maryland]]. Calspan also has thirteen field offices throughout the Eastern United States which perform accident investigations on behalf of the [[United States Department of Transportation]].

==History==
The facility was started as a private defense contractor in the home front of [[World War II]]. As a part of its tax planning in the wake of the war effort, Curtiss-Wright donated the facility to [[Cornell University]] to operate "as a public trust" and received a [[Charitable contribution deductions in the United States|charitable tax deduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cornell?a=d&amp;d=CDS19451221.2.6|title=Curtiss-Wright Corp. Gives Lab to Cornell; To Aid Air Research|work=Cornell Daily Sun|date=Dec 21, 1945|page=2|accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven other east coast aircraft companies also donated $675,000 to provide working capital for the lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/newscornell?a=d&amp;srpos=4&amp;cl=search&amp;d=CDS19460215.2.2.1&amp;e=--------20--1----Cornell+Aeronautical+Laboratory-all|title=Aircraft Companies Donate Gift To Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory|work=Cornell Daily Sun|date=Feb 15, 1946|page=2|accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lab operated under the name '''Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory''' from 1946 until 1972. During this same time, Cornell formed a new Graduate School of Aerospace Engineering on its [[Ithaca, New York]] campus. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, universities came under criticism for conducting war-related research particularly as the [[Vietnam War]] became unpopular, and [[Cornell University]] tried to sever its ties.  Similar laboratories at other colleges, such as the [[Lincoln Laboratory]] and [[Draper Laboratory]] at MIT came under similar criticism, but some labs, such as Lincoln, retained their collegiate ties. Cornell accepted a $25 million offer from EDP Technology, Inc. to purchase the lab in 1968.&lt;ref name="zuckerman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/newscornell?a=d&amp;srpos=7&amp;cl=search&amp;d=CDS19680918.2.1.2&amp;e=--------20--1----Cornell+Aeronautical+Laboratory-all|title=Trustees Accept Firm's Offer of $25M for CAL Purchase|work=Cornell Daily Sun|date=Sep 18, 1968|page=1|accessdate=2009-10-18|first=Edward|last=Zuckerman}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a group of lab employees who had made a competing $15 million offer organized a lawsuit to block the sale. In May 1971, New York's highest court ruled that Cornell had the right to sell the lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/newscornell?a=d&amp;srpos=39&amp;cl=search&amp;d=CDS19710513.2.1.5&amp;e=--------20--21----Cornell+Aeronautical+Laboratory-all|title=Court Ruling Okays Planned Sale of CAL|work=Cornell Daily Sun|date=May 13, 1971|page=1|accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of the suit, EDP Technology could not raise the money, and in 1972, Cornell reorganized the lab as the for-profit "Calspan Corporation" and then sold its stock in Calspan to the public.

Calspan was the first in a series of corporate owners that have included Arvin Industries, Space Industries International, Veridian Corporation and [[General Dynamics]].

In 2005, Calspan Corporation was returned to independent ownership when a local management group purchased the Aeronautics and Transportation Testing Groups of the Western New York operation from General Dynamics.

Under the name of Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory were inventions of the first [[crash test dummy]] in 1948, the automotive [[seat belt]] in 1951, the first mobile field unit with [[Pulse-Doppler radar|Doppler]] [[weather radar]] for [[Weather forecasting|weather-tracking]] in 1956, the first accurate airborne [[simulation]] of another [[aircraft]] (the [[North American Aviation|North American]] [[X-15]]) in 1960, the first successful demonstration of an automatic [[terrain-following radar]] system in 1964, the first use of a [[laser]] beam to successfully measure [[Gas constant|gas density]] in 1966, the first independent HYGE sled test facility to evaluate [[automotive]] [[Seat belt|restraint]] systems in 1967, the mytron, an instrument for research on neuromuscular behavior and disorders in 1969, and the prototype for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s [[fingerprint]] reading system in 1972. CAL served as an "honest broker" making objective comparisons of competing plans to build military hardware.&lt;ref name=zuckerman/&gt; It also conducted classified counter-insurgency research in [[Thailand]] for the Defense Department.&lt;ref name=zuckerman/&gt; By the time of its divestiture, CAL had 1,600 employees.&lt;ref name=zuckerman/&gt;

Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory conducted [[wind tunnel]] tests on models of a number of [[skyscraper]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, including the [[John Hancock Tower]] in Boston, Massachusetts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4518">The '''Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas''' (lit. "Center for Research in Mathematics"), commonly known by its acronym in [[Spanish language]] as '''CIMAT''', is a [[North America]]n scientific research institution based on the city of [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]], in the homonym State of [[Guanajuato]], in central [[Mexico]], and was established in the year 1980. It belongs to the Mexican National System of Public Centers of Research under administration of the country's [[CONACyT|National Council of Science and Technology (CONACyT)]].

CIMAT is oriented to scientific research under the auspices of the Mexican government. It is also devoted to the generation, dissemination and application of knowledge in specialized fields, as well as to the formation of human resources in the areas of Pure and Applied [[mathematics]], [[Probability]] and [[Statistics]], and [[Computer Science]]. Of CIMAT's faculty, more than 80% of the researchers belong to the Mexican National System of Researchers ([[Sistema Nacional de Investigadores|SNI]]), and 93% hold a Ph.D. Degree. Academically, the center is organized in four main areas: [[Pure Mathematics]],  [[Applied Mathematics]], Probability and Statistics, and Computer Science.

The research groups of the center interact strongly with similar institutions in Mexico and in foreign countries. This provides a continuous flow of visitors from around the world and provides conferences, workshops, and seminars.

The educational programs at CIMAT currently have more than 200 students, who come from all over the country and from abroad (mainly from [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]n countries, but also from [[Africa|African countries]], the rest of North America, [[Spain]] and other countries). The Master's and Doctorate programs offered at the center are registered in the Excellency Graduate Studies Registry of the National Council of Science and Technology, CONACyT.

CIMAT's infrastructure includes offices, an auditorium, many seminar rooms, a specialized mathematical library, computing equipment, electronic communication devices, and a lodge known as CIMATEL, for the arrangement of national and international conferences, courses and academic reunions.

==Education==

The center offers undergraduate and graduate programs that are attended by students from all over the country and abroad. The undergraduate programs are offered jointly with the [[University of Guanajuato]], yet the teaching is in charge of the center's faculty. Many of the undergraduate students are former international/Iberoamerican [[mathematical Olympiad]] or informatics Olympiad contestants and medal winners.

CIMAT has an important role in the teaching of the mathematics and computer science undergraduate programs of the mathematics department of the [[University of Guanajuato]].

Also, CIMAT offers a thesis-writing program, for students affiliated to other universities in the country.

Courses are usually offered in Spanish only.

==Departments==

The center has three departments:
*'''Pure and Applied mathematics.''' Research groups are devoted to [[differential geometry]], [[algebraic geometry]], [[applied mathematics]], [[dynamical systems]], [[functional analysis]], [[topology]] and [[combinatorial geometry]]. 
*'''Probability and Statistics.''' Research groups are interested in probability and [[stochastic processes]], environmental statistics, and industrial statistics.
*'''Computer science.''' Research lines include: [[image processing]] and [[computer vision]], [[robotics]],  [[numerical methods]], [[ optimization]], [[pattern recognition]] and [[data transmission]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5479">'''Chartered Physicist''' ('''CPhys''') is a [[chartered (professional)|chartered status]] and a [[professional qualification]] awarded by the [[Institute of Physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/physicist.aspx|title=Job profiles: Physicist|website=National Careers Service|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is denoted by the postnominals "CPhys".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VkqCBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Titles and Forms of Address: A Guide to Correct Use|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|page=xvii|date=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Achieving chartered status in any profession denotes to the wider community a high level of specialised subject knowledge and professional competence. According to the Institute of Physics, holders of the award of the Chartered Physicist (CPhys) demonstrate the "highest standards of professionalism, up-to-date expertise, quality and safety" along with "the capacity to undertake independent practice and exercise leadership" as well as "commitment to keep pace with advancing knowledge and with the increasing expectations and requirements for which any profession must take responsibility".&lt;ref name="CPhys guidelines"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/membership/char-sta/chartership/cphys/page_51812.html|title=Chartered Physicist (CPhys)|accessdate=25 May 2016|publisher=Institute of Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of Chartered Physicist was introduced in 1985 following approval from the [[Privy Council (UK)|Privy Council]]. It was originally granted  automatically with corporate membership of the Institute of Physics (IoP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NtMiBPgdF6cC&amp;pg=PA183#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=125 Years: The Physical Society &amp; The Institute of Physics|author=John L. Lewis|publisher=CRC Press|date= 1 January 1999|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reform of the membership structure in 1998 saw Chartered Physicist established as a separate qualification from 2001 that could be gained either alongside or after the status of Member or Fellow of the IoP. In order to gain the qualification, a physicist must be appropriately qualified (an accredited MSci or [[MPhys]] integrated master's degree is standard, although experience leading to an equivalent level can be counted), have had a minimum of two years of structured training and a minimum of two years responsible work experience, have demonstrated a commitment to continuing professional development, and have gained a number of competencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/about/royal_charter/file_38390.pdf| title=Charter and Bylaws|accessdate=25 May 2016|publisher=Institute of Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt; For physicists gaining the status from 2012, revalidation through proof of [[continuing professional development]] is required every three years.&lt;ref name="CPhys guidelines"/&gt; 

Chartered Physicist is considered to be equal in status to [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|Chartered Engineer]], which the IoP also awards as a member of the [[Engineering Council UK]], and other chartered statuses in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/membership/char-sta/chartership/why/file_38066.pdf|title=Becoming Chartered by the Institute – Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=25 May 2016|publisher=Institute of Physics|quote="[Q]Which one [Chartered Physicist or Chartered Engineer] is best?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11332">'''Cheminformatics''' (also known as '''chemoinformatics''', '''chemioinformatics''' and '''chemical informatics''')  is the use of computer and [[Information science|informational]] techniques applied to a range of problems in the field of [[chemistry]].

These methods can also be used in chemical and allied industries in various other forms.

== History ==

The term chemoinformatics was defined by F.K. Brown&lt;ref name="Brown_1998"&gt;{{Cite book | author = F.K. Brown | title = Chapter 35. Chemoinformatics: What is it and How does it Impact Drug Discovery | journal = Annual Reports in Med.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chemoinformatics is the mixing of those information resources to transform data into information and information into knowledge for the intended purpose of making better decisions faster in the area of drug lead identification and optimization.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since then, both spellings have been used, and some have evolved to be established as Cheminformatics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.molinspiration.com/chemoinformatics.html Cheminformatics or Chemoinformatics ?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; while European Academia settled in 2006 for Chemoinformatics.&lt;ref name="Obernai"&gt;[http://infochim.u-strasbg.fr/chemoinformatics/Obernai%20Declaration.pdf Obernai Declaration]&lt;/ref&gt; The recent establishment of the [[Journal of Cheminformatics]] is a strong push towards the shorter variant.

== Basics ==
Cheminformatics combines the scientific working fields of [[chemistry]], [[computer science]] and [[information science]] for example in the areas of [[topology (chemistry)|topology]], [[chemical graph theory]], [[information retrieval]] and [[data mining]] in the [[chemical space]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roy|first=Ambrish|last2=Srinivasan|first2=Bharath|last3=Skolnick|first3=Jeffrey|date=2015-08-12|title=PoLi: A Virtual Screening Pipeline Based on Template Pocket and Ligand Similarity|journal=Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling|language=EN|volume=55|issue=8|pages=1757–1770|doi=10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00232|issn=1549-9596|pmc=4593500|pmid=26225536}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Bharath|last2=Tonddast-Navaei‡|first2=Sam|last3=Roy§|first3=Ambrish|last4=Zhou|first4=Hongyi|last5=Skolnick|first5=Jeffrey|date=2018-09-07|title=Chemical space of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors: New approaches for discovering novel drugs for old bugs|journal=Medicinal Research Reviews|language=en|doi=10.1002/med.21538|pmid=30192413|issn=0198-6325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Bharath|last2=Tonddast-Navaei|first2=Sam|last3=Skolnick|first3=Jeffrey|date=September 2017|title=Pocket detection and interaction-weighted ligand-similarity search yields novel high-affinity binders for Myocilin-OLF, a protein implicated in glaucoma|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960894X1730731X|journal=Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters|volume=27|issue=17|pages=4133–4139|doi=10.1016/j.bmcl.2017.07.035|issn=0960-894X|pmc=5568477|pmid=28739043}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Bharath|last2=Zhou|first2=Hongyi|last3=Mitra|first3=Sreyoshi|last4=Skolnick|first4=Jeffrey|date=October 2016|title=Novel small molecule binders of human N-glycanase 1, a key player in the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation pathway|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0968089616306265|journal=Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry|volume=24|issue=19|pages=4750–4758|doi=10.1016/j.bmc.2016.08.019|issn=0968-0896|pmc=5015769|pmid=27567076}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gasteiger_2004"&gt;Gasteiger J.(Editor), Engel T.(Editor): ''Chemoinformatics : A Textbook''.

== Applications ==

===Storage and retrieval===
{{main|Chemical database}}
The primary application of cheminformatics is in the storage, indexing and search of information relating to compounds. The efficient search of such stored information includes topics that are dealt with in computer science as [[data mining]], [[information retrieval]], [[information extraction]] and [[machine learning]]. Related research topics include:
* [[Unstructured data]]
**[[Information retrieval]]
**[[Information extraction]]
* [[Structured data mining]] and mining of [[structured data]]
**[[Database mining]]
**[[Graph mining]]
**[[Molecule mining]]
**[[Sequence mining]]
**[[Tree mining]]
*[[Digital libraries]]

==== File formats ====
{{main|Chemical file format}}
The ''in silico'' representation of chemical structures uses specialized formats such as the [[XML]]-based [[Chemical Markup Language]] or [[Simplified molecular input line entry specification|SMILES]].  These representations are often used for storage in large [[chemical database]]s. While some formats are suited for visual representations in 2 or 3 dimensions, others are more suited for studying physical interactions, modeling and docking studies.

=== Virtual libraries ===
Chemical data can pertain to real or virtual molecules.  Virtual libraries of compounds
may be generated in various ways to explore chemical space and hypothesize novel 
compounds with desired properties.

Virtual libraries of classes of compounds (drugs, natural products, diversity-oriented synthetic products) were recently generated using the FOG (fragment optimized growth) algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=FOG: Fragment Optimized Growth Algorithm for the de Novo Generation of Molecules occupying Druglike Chemical | last=Kutchukian | first=Peter  |author2=Lou, David |author3=Shakhnovich, Eugene  |journal=Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling | year=2009 |volume=49 | pages=1630–1642|doi=10.1021/ci9000458|pmid=19527020|issue=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was done by using cheminformatic tools to train transition probabilities of a [[Markov chain]] on authentic classes of compounds, and then using the Markov chain to generate novel compounds that were similar to the training database.

=== Virtual screening ===
{{main|Virtual screening}}
In contrast to [[high-throughput screening]], virtual screening involves computationally
screening ''[[in silico]]'' libraries of compounds, by means of various methods such as
[[docking (molecular)|docking]], to identify members likely to possess desired properties
such as biological activity against a given target&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. In some cases, [[combinatorial chemistry]] is used in the development of the library to increase the efficiency in mining the chemical space. More commonly, a diverse library of small molecules or [[natural product]]s is screened.

===Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)===
{{main|Quantitative structure–activity relationship}}
This is the calculation of [[quantitative structure–activity relationship]] and [[QSPR|quantitative structure property relationship]] values, used to predict the activity of compounds from their structures. In this context there is also a strong relationship to [[chemometrics]]. Chemical [[expert system]]s are also relevant, since they represent parts of chemical knowledge as an ''[[in silico]]'' representation. There is a relatively new concept of [[matched molecular pair analysis]] or prediction-driven MMPA which is coupled with QSAR model in order to identify activity cliff.&lt;ref name="Prediction-driven matched molecular pairs to interpret QSARs and aid the molecular optimization process"&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.jcheminf.com/content/6/1/48/abstract | doi=10.1186/s13321-014-0048-0| pmid=25544551| pmc=4272757| title=Prediction-driven matched molecular pairs to interpret QSARs and aid the molecular optimization process| journal=Journal of Cheminformatics| volume=6| issue=1| pages=48| year=2014| last1=Sushko| first1=Yurii| last2=Novotarskyi| first2=Sergii| last3=Körner| first3=Robert| last4=Vogt| first4=Joachim| last5=Abdelaziz| first5=Ahmed| last6=Tetko| first6=Igor V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chemistry set''' is an [[educational toy]] allowing the user (typically a [[teenager]]) to perform simple [[chemistry]] [[experiment]]s.

==History==

===Forerunners===
[[File:Natural Magick by Giambattista della Porta.jpg|thumb|left|120px|''Natural Magick'', Giambattista della Porta, 1658]]
[[File:Gottling Description of a portable chest of chemistry title page 1791.jpg|thumb|right|120px| ''Description of a portable chest of chemistry'', 1791]]
[[File:Griffin’s Chemical Laboratory.jpg |thumb|upright=1.2|right| Griffin’s Chemical Laboratory, Glasgow, ca.1850.]]

The earliest forerunners of the chemistry set are 17th century books on "natural magick", "which all excellent wise men do admit and embrace, and worship with great applause; neither is there any thing more highly esteemed, or better thought of, by men of learning."&lt;ref name="Deckard"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deckard|first1=Michael Funk|last2=Losonczi|first2=Péter|title=Philosophy begins in wonder : an introduction to early modern philosophy, theology, and science|date=2010|publisher=Pickwick Publications|location=Eugene, Or.|isbn=978-1556357824|pages=55–57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IYcSCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors such as [[Giambattista della Porta]] included chemical magic tricks and scientific puzzles along with more serious topics.&lt;ref name="Deckard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Macrakis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macrakis|first1=Kristie|title=Prisoners, lovers, &amp; spies : the story of invisible ink from Herodotus to al-Qaeda|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=9780300179255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest chemistry sets were developed in the 18th century in England and Germany, with the purpose of teaching chemistry to adults.  In 1791, ''Description of a portable chest of chemistry : or, Complete collection of chemical tests for the use of chemists, physicians, mineralogists, metallurgists, scientific artists, manufacturers, farmers, and the cultivators of natural philosophy'' by [[Johann Friedrich August Göttling]], translated from German, was published in English.&lt;ref name="Goettling"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goettling|first1=Johann Friedrich August|title=Description of a portable chest of chemistry : or, Complete collection of chemical tests for the use of chemists, physicians, mineralogists, metallurgists, scientific artists, manufacturers, farmers, and the cultivators of natural philosophy / invented by J.F.A. Gottling ; translated from the original German|date=1791|publisher=Printed for C. and G. Kearsley|location=London|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435018354548;page=root;view=image;size=100;seq=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Accum]] of London, England also sold portable chemistry sets and materials to refill them.&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt;    Used primarily for training druggists and medical students, they could also be carried and used in the field.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;

Scientific kits also attracted well-educated members of the upper class who enjoyed experimenting and demonstrating their results.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=James M.|title=The Chemistry Set: Chemistry's legacy of the home laboratory|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine|date=Spring 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=12–13, 34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Woodhouse]] of Philadelphia presented a ''Young Chemist's Pocket Companion'' (1797) with an accompanying portable laboratory, specifically targeted ladies and gentlemen. [[Jane Marcet]]'s books on chemistry helped to popularize chemistry as a well-to-do pastime for both men and women.&lt;ref name="Cook"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cook|first1=Rosie|title=Chemistry at Play|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine|date=2010|volume=28|issue=1|pages=20–25|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/chemistry-at-play|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 1850s [[John Joseph Griffin|John J. Griffin &amp; Sons]] sold a line of "chemical cabinets", eventually offering 11 categories. These were marketed primarily to adults including elementary school teachers as well as students at the Royal Naval College, the [[Royal Agricultural Society of England|Royal Agricultural Society]], and the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt;

In the mid to late 1800s England, magic and illusion toys enabled children to make their own fireworks, create disappearing inks and cause changes in color, tricks which were mostly chemically based.&lt;ref name="Nicholls"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nicholls|first1=Henry|title=The chemistry set generation|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/issues/2007/december/thechemistrysetgeneration.asp|accessdate=1 February 2016|work=Royal Society of Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Columbian Cyclopedia'' of 1897 defines "CHEMISTRY TOYS" as "mostly [[pyrotechnic]]; recommended as illustrating to the young the rudiments of chemistry, but probably more dangerous than efficient for such use", listing a variety of hazardous examples.&lt;ref name="Columbian"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Columbian Cyclopedia|date=1897|publisher=Garretson, Cox &amp; Company|location=New York|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007958177|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemistry sets as toys===
[[File:Porter Chemcraft Senior Set No. 6105 2004046 closed.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Porter Chemcraft Senior Set, 1957, at the [[Science History Institute]] ]]

Beginning in the early 1900s, modern chemistry sets targeted younger people with the intention to popularize chemistry. In the United States, [[Porter Chemical Company]] and the [[A. C. Gilbert Company]] produced the best known sets. Although Porter and Gilbert were the largest American producers of chemistry sets, other manufacturers such as the [[Skilcraft]] corporation were also active.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;

[[John J. Porter]] and his brother [[Harold Mitchell Porter]] began The Porter Chemical Company in 1914. Their initial purpose was to sell packaged chemicals, but they soon introduced kits. John researched the experiments, while Harold wrote the instruction manuals. Their earliest toys, under the "Chemcraft" trademark, were "chemical magic" sets, selling for less than one dollar (or about $25 in 2017&lt;ref&gt;https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=1&amp;year1=191401&amp;year2=201711&lt;/ref&gt;). By the 1920s, they sold six different sets, the largest of which sold for $25 (or about $320 in 2017&lt;ref&gt;https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=25.00&amp;year1=192001&amp;year2=201711&lt;/ref&gt;). Their range of toys broadened throughout the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt; In the 1950s it was possible to buy toys featuring radioactive ores, such as the "[[Gilbert U-238 Atomic Energy Laboratory]]," which included a [[Geiger counter]] and [[cloud chamber]].&lt;ref name="Kingson"/&gt;

[[File:1940s Gilbert chemistry set 04.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A 1940s [[A. C. Gilbert Company|Gilbert]] chemistry set]]

[[Alfred Carlton Gilbert]] earned money by performing magic tricks while a medical student at Yale. He and John Petrie formed the Mysto Manufacturing Company (later the [[A. C. Gilbert Company]]) in 1909, and began selling boxed magic sets. By 1917, they sold chemistry sets, which they produced through [[World War II]], in spite of restrictions on materials. [[Robert Treat Johnson]], noting the number of chemistry students at Yale whose interest in the science began with a chemistry set, argued the production of chemistry sets was a "patriotic duty."&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;

Toy companies promoted chemistry sets through advertising campaigns, the "Chemcraft Chemist Club" and its accompanying "Chemcraft Science Magazine", comic books, and essay contests such as Porter's "Why I want to be a scientist". The goal of attracting students to a potential career in chemistry was often explicit in the sets' naming and promotion.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt; Chemistry sets may have been the first American toys marketed toward parents with the goal of "improving" children for success in later life.&lt;ref name="Kingson"/&gt;

[[File:Gilbert Lab Technician Set for Girls 1958.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Gilbert Lab Technician Set for Girls, 1958, at the [[Science History Institute]] ]]

The target market for chemistry sets was almost exclusively at boys, whom they deemed "young men of science." However, during the 1950s, Gilbert managed to introduce a set targeting girls. They sold the set in an attractive pink box, but the set identified girls as "laboratory assistants" or "lab technicians," not scientists.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kingson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kingson|first1=Jennifer A.|title=A Brief History of Chemistry Sets: Practical to Career-Oriented to Just Plain Fun|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/science/a-brief-history-of-chemistry-sets.html?_r=0|accessdate=1 February 2016|work=New York Times|date=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-known chemistry sets from the United Kingdom include the 1960s and 1970s sets by [[Thomas Salter (company)|Thomas Salter]] Science (produced in Scotland) and later [[Salter Science]], then the [[J &amp; L Randall|"MERIT"]] sets through the 1970s and 1980s. [[Dekkertoys]] created a range of sets which were similar, complete with glass test tubes of dry chemicals.

==Decline== 
Around the 1960s, increasing social distrust of chemistry, safety concerns, and government regulation began to limit the range of materials and experiments available in chemistry sets. In the United States, the [[Federal Hazardous Substances Labeling Act]] of 1960, the [[Toy Safety Act]] of 1969 and the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]], established in 1972, and the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] of 1976 all introduced new levels of regulation,&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt; which led to the decline of chemistry sets' popularity during the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="Monahan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Monahan|first1=Maureen|title=The Dynamic History of the Toy Chemistry Set|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/72452/dynamic-history-toy-chemistry-set|accessdate=1 February 2016|work=Mental Floss|date=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The A. C. Gilbert Company went out of business in 1967, and the Porter Chemical Company went out of business in 1984.&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt;

Modern chemistry sets, with a few exceptions, tend to include a more restricted range of chemicals and simplified instructions. Many chemistry kits are single use, containing only the types and amounts of chemicals for a specific application.&lt;ref&gt;

==Plants==
[[File:Ice Storm 2013, Guelph 06.jpg|thumb|Plant covered in snow after an ice storm in 2013, Ontario, Canada]]

Cold hardening is a process in which a plant undergoes physiological changes to avoid, or mitigate [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] injuries caused by sub-zero temperatures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Non-acclimatized individuals can survive −5&amp;nbsp;°C, while an acclimatized individual in the same species can survive −30°. Plants that originated in the tropics, like [[tomato]] or [[maize]], don't go through cold hardening and are unable to survive freezing temperatures.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKhann|first=Heather I.|last2=Gery|first2=Carine|last3=Bérard|first3=Aurélie|last4=Lévêque|first4=Sylvie|last5=Zuther|first5=Ellen|last6=Hincha|first6=Dirk K.|last7=De Mita|first7=S.|last8=Brunel|first8=Dominique|last9=Téoulé|first9=Evelyne|date=2008-01-01|title=Natural variation in CBF gene sequence, gene expression and freezing tolerance in the Versailles core collection of Arabidopsis thaliana|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-8-105|journal=BMC Plant Biology|volume=8|pages=105|doi=10.1186/1471-2229-8-105|issn=1471-2229|pmc=2579297|pmid=18922165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant starts the [[Adaptation (biology)|adaptation]] by exposure to cold yet still not freezing temperatures. The process can be divided into three steps. First the plant perceives low temperature, then converts the [[Signal (biology)|signal]] to activate or repress [[Gene expression|expression]] of appropriate [[gene]]s. Finally, it uses these genes to combat the [[Stress (biology)|stress]], caused by sub-zero temperatures, affecting its living [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. Many of the genes and responses to low temperature [[Stress (biology)|stress]] are shared with other [[abiotic stress]]es, like drought or salinity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[Image:Plant cell structure-en.svg|thumb|200px|Schematic of typical plant cell]]When temperature drops, the [[Cell membrane|membrane]] fluidity, [[RNA]] and [[DNA]] stability, and [[enzyme]] activity change. These, in turn, affect [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]], [[Translation (biology)|translation]], [[Metabolism|intermediate metabolism]], and [[photosynthesis]], leading to an energy imbalance. This energy imbalance is thought to be one of the ways the plant detects low temperature. Experiments on ''[[arabidopsis]]'' show that the plant detects the change in temperature, rather than the [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The rate of temperature drop is directly connected to the magnitude of [[calcium]] influx, from the space between cells, into the cell. [[Calcium channel]]s in the [[cell membrane]] detect the temperature drop, and promotes expression of low temperature responsible genes in ''[[alfalfa]]'' and ''[[arabidopsis]]''. The response to the change in [[calcium]] elevation depends on the cell type and [[Stress (biology)|stress]] history. [[Shoot]] tissue will respond more than a [[root]] cells, and a cell that already is [[Adaptation|adapted]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;to [[Hypothermia|cold stress]] will respond more than one that has not been through cold hardening before. Light doesn't control the onset of cold hardening directly, but shortening of daylight is associated with fall, and starts production of [[reactive oxygen species]] and excitation of [[Photosystem II|photosystem 2]], which influences low-temp [[signal transduction]] mechanisms. Plants with compromised perception of day length have compromised cold acclimation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Cold increases [[Cell permeability|cell membrane permeability]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=itB5yKv7-rIC|title=Plants in Agriculture|last=Forbes|first=James C.|last2=Watson|first2=Drennan|date=1992-08-20|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521427913|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and makes the cell shrink, as water is drawn out when ice is formed in the [[extracellular matrix]] between cells.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To retain the [[surface area]] of the [[cell membrane]] so it will be able to regain its former [[volume]] when temperature rises again, the plant forms more and stronger [[Hechtian strand]]s. These are tubelike structures that connect the [[protoplast]] with the cell wall. When the [[intracellular]] water freezes, the cell will expand, and without cold hardening the cell would rupture. To protect the cell membrane from expansion induced damage, the plant cell changes the proportions of almost all [[lipid]]s in the cell membrane, and increases the amount of total soluble [[protein]] and other cryoprotecting molecules, like sugar and [[proline]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Chilling injury occurs at 0–10 degrees Celsius, as a result of membrane damage, metabolic changes, and toxic buildup. Symptoms include wilting, water soaking, [[necrosis]], [[chlorosis]], ion leakage, and decreased growth. Freezing injury may occur at temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius. Symptoms of extracellular freezing include structural damage, dehydration, and necrosis. If intracellular freezing occurs, it will lead to death. Freezing injury is a result of lost permeability, plasmolysis, and post-thaw cell bursting.

When spring comes, or during a mild spell in winter, plants de-harden, and if the temperature is warm for long enough – their growth resumes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Insects==
Cold hardening has also been observed in [[insect]]s such as the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] and [[diamondback moth]]. The insects use rapid cold hardening to protect against [[cold shock]] during overwintering periods.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A rapid cold-hardening process in insects|last=Chen|first=CP|last2=Denlinger|first2=DL|journal=Science|last3=Lee|first3=RE|pmid=17800568|doi=10.1126/science.238.4832.1415|volume=238|issue=4832|pages=1415–7|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A rapid cold-hardening response protecting against cold shock injury in Drosophila melanogaster|last=Lee|first=RE|last2=Czajka|first2=MC|publisher=Science|pmid=2106564|volume=148|journal=J Exp Biol|pages=245–54|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Overwintering]] insects stay awake and active through the winter while non-overwintering insects [[Insect migration|migrate]] or die. Rapid cold hardening can be experienced during short periods of undesirable temperatures, such as [[Cold shock response|cold shock]] in environment temperature, as well as the common cold months. The buildup of [[Cryoprotectant|cryoprotective]] compounds is the reason that insects can experience cold hardening.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Glycerol]] is a cryoprotective substance found within these insects capable of overwintering. Through testing, glycerol requires interactions with other [[cell components]] within the insect in order to decrease the body's permeability to the cold.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When an insect is exposed to these cold temperatures, glycerol rapidly accumulates. Glycerol is known as a [[non-ionic]] [[Kosmotropic|kosmotrope]] forming powerful [[hydrogen bond]]s with [[water molecule]]s. The hydrogen bonds in the glycerol compound compete with the weaker bonds between the water molecules causing an interruption in the makeup of ice formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duman | first1 = J | year = 2002 | title = The inhibition of ice nucleators by insect antifreeze proteins is enhanced by glycerol and citrate | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00360-001-0239-7 | journal = Journal of Comparative Physiology B | volume = 172 | issue = 2| pages = 163–168 | doi = 10.1007/s00360-001-0239-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This chemistry found within the glycerol compound and reaction between water has been used as an [[antifreeze]] in the past, and can be seen here when concerning cold hardening. Proteins also play a large role in the cryoprotective compounds that increase ability to survive the cold hardening process and environmental change. [[Glycogen phosphorylase]] (GlyP) has been a key protein found during testing to increase in comparison to a controlled group not experiencing the cold hardening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Overgaard | first1 = J. | last2 = Sørensen | first2 = J. G. | last3 = Com | first3 = E. | last4 = Colinet | first4 = H. | year = 2013 | title = The rapid cold hardening response of Drosophila melanogaster: Complex regulation across different levels of biological organization | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022191014000109 | journal = Journal of Insect Physiology | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 46–53 | doi=10.1016/j.jinsphys.2014.01.009| pmid = 24508557 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once warmer temperatures are observed the process of [[acclimation]] begins, and the increased glycerol along with other cryoprotective compounds and proteins are also reversed. There is a rapid cold hardening capacity found within certain insects that suggests not all insects can survive a long period of overwintering. Non-[[Diapause|diapausing]] insects can sustain brief temperature shocks but often have a limit to which they can handle before the body can no longer produce enough cryoprotective components.
&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[File:Saving the planet one fruit fly at a time - part 1 (7353498896).jpg|thumb|The common fruit fly]]
Inclusive to the cold hardening process being beneficial for insects survival during cold temperatures, it also helps improve the [[organism]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s performance.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = R. E. | last2 = Damodaran | first2 = K. | last3 = Yi | first3 = S. X. | last4 = Lorigan | first4 = G.

The ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' (common fruit fly) is a frequently experimented insect involving cold hardening. A proven example of RCH enhancing organisms performance comes from courting and mating within the fruit fly. It has been tested that the fruit fly mated more frequently once RCH has commenced in relation to a controlled insect group not experiencing RCH.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Most insects experiencing extended cold periods are observed to modify the [[membrane lipids]] within the body. Desaturation of [[fatty acid]]s are the most commonly seen modification to the [[membrane]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; When the fruit fly was observed under the stressful climate the survival rate increased in comparison to the fly prior to cold hardening.
[[File:Plutella.xylostella.7383.jpg|thumb|The diamondback moth]]
In addition to testing on the common fruit fly, ''[[Diamondback moth|Plutella xylostella]]'' (diamondback moth) also has been widely studied for its significance in cold hardening. While this insect also shows an increase in glycerol and similar cryoprotective compounds, it also shows an increase in [[polyol]]s. These compounds are specifically linked to cryoprotective compounds designed to withstand cold hardening. The polyol compound is freeze-susceptible and [[Freeze tolerance|freeze tolerant]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Park | first1 = Y. | last2 = Kim | first2 = Y. | year = 2014 | title = A specific glycerol kinase induces rapid cold hardening of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022191014001255 | journal = Journal of Insect Physiology | volume = 67 | issue = | pages = 56–63 | doi=10.1016/j.jinsphys.2014.06.010| pmid = 24973793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyols simply act as a barrier within the insect body by preventing [[intracellular]] freezing by restricting the [[extracellular]] freezing likely to happen in overwintering periods.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; During the larvae stage of the diamondback moth, the significance of glycerol was tested again for validity. The lab injected the larvae with added glycerol and in turn proved that glycerol is a major factor in survival rate when cold hardening. The cold tolerance is directly proportional to the buildup of glycerol during cold hardening.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Cold hardening of insects improves the survival rate of the species and improves function. Once environmental temperature begins to warm up above freezing, the cold hardening process is reversed and the glycerol and cryprotective compounds decrease within the body. This also reverts the function of the insect to pre-cold hardening activity.

In [[computer science]], a '''computation history''' is a sequence of steps taken by an [[abstract machine]] in the process of computing its result.  Computation histories are frequently used in [[Mathematical proof|proofs]] about the capabilities of certain machines, and particularly about the [[undecidable problem|undecidability]] of various [[formal languages]].

Formally, a computation history is a (normally [[Finite set|finite]]) sequence of '''configurations''' of a formal [[automaton]].  Each configuration fully describes the status of the machine at a particular point.  To be valid, certain conditions must hold:
* the first configuration must be a valid initial configuration of the automaton and
* each transition between adjacent configurations must be valid according to the transition rules of the automaton.
In addition, to be '''complete''', a computation history must be finite and
* the final configuration must be a valid terminal configuration of the automaton.
The definitions of "valid initial configuration", "valid transition", and "valid terminal configuration" vary for different kinds of formal machines.

A [[deterministic]] automaton has exactly one computation history for a given initial configuration, though the history may be infinite and therefore incomplete.

== Finite State Machines ==
For a [[finite state machine]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, a configuration is simply
the current state of the machine, together with the remaining input.  The first configuration must be the initial state of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and the complete input.  A transition from a configuration &lt;math&gt;(S,I)&lt;/math&gt; to
a configuration &lt;math&gt;(T,J)&lt;/math&gt; is allowed if &lt;math&gt;I=aJ&lt;/math&gt; for
some input symbol &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; has a transition from
&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; on input &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.  The final
configuration must have the empty string &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; as its remaining
input;  whether &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; has accepted or rejected the input depends
on whether the final state is an accepting state. &lt;ref name="MumfordJain2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christine L. Mumford|author2=Lakhmi C. Jain|title=Computational Intelligence: Collaboration, Fusion and Emergence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eECU8WrC99wC&amp;pg=PA337|accessdate=25 March 2012|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-01798-8|page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Turing Machines ==

Computation histories are more commonly used in reference to [[Turing machines]].  The configuration of a single-tape Turing machine consists of the contents of the tape, the position of the read/write head on the tape, and the current state of the associated state machine;  this is usually written

&lt;math&gt;...0011010101q00110101010...&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the current state of the machine, represented in some
way that's distinguishable from the tape language, and where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is
positioned immediately before the position of the read/write head.

Consider a Turing machine &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; on input &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.  The first
configuration must be &lt;math&gt;q_0 w_0 w_1 ...&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt;
is the initial state of the Turing machine.  The machine's state in the final
configuration must be either &lt;math&gt;q_a&lt;/math&gt; (the accept state) or &lt;math&gt;q_r&lt;/math&gt;
(the reject state).  A configuration &lt;math&gt;c_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; is a valid successor
to configuration &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; if there's a transition from the state in
&lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; to the state in &lt;math&gt;c_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; which manipulates the
tape and moves the read/write head in a way that produces the result in
&lt;math&gt;c_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Blass2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andreas Blass|title=Fields of Logic and Computation: Essays Dedicated to Yuri Gurevich on the Occasion of His 70th Birthday|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HqIRT51n74YC&amp;pg=PA468|accessdate=25 March 2012|date=22 October 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-15024-1|page=468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decidability results ===

Computation histories can be used to show that certain problems for
[[pushdown automata]] are [[undecidable problem|undecidable]].  This is because the language of
non-accepting computation histories of a Turing machine &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;
on input &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is a [[context-free language]] recognizable by a
non-deterministic pushdown automaton.

We encode a Turing computation history &lt;math&gt;c_0,c_1,...,c_n&lt;/math&gt; as the
string &lt;math&gt;C_0 \# C^r_1 \# C_2 \# C^r_3 \# ... \# C_n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt;
is the encoding of configuration &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt;, as discussed above, and where
every other configuration is written in reverse.  Before reading a particular
configuration, the pushdown automaton makes a non-deterministic choice
to either ignore the configuration or read it completely onto the stack.

* If the pushdown automaton decides to ignore the configuration, it simply reads and discards it completely and makes the same choice for the next one.
* If it decides to process the configuration, it pushes it completely onto the stack, then verifies that the next configuration is a valid successor according to the rules of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.  Since successive configurations are always written in opposite orders, this can be done by, for each tape symbol in the new configuration, popping off a symbol from the stack and checking if they're the same.  Where they disagree, it must be accountable for by a valid transition of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.  If, at any point, the automaton decides that the transition is invalid, it immediately enters a special accept state which ignores the rest of the input and accepts at the end.

In addition, the automaton verifies that the first configuration is the correct
initial configuration (if not, it accepts) and that the state of the final
configuration of the history is the accept state (if not, it accepts).  Since
a non-deterministic automaton accepts if there's any valid way for it to accept,
the automaton described here will discover if the history is not a valid
accepting history and will accept if so, and reject if not. &lt;ref name="Blum1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lenore Blum|title=Complexity and real computation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zxtrVqUP-AwC&amp;pg=PA31|accessdate=25 March 2012|year=1998|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-98281-6|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This same trick cannot be used to recognize ''accepting'' computation histories
with an NPDA, since non-determinism could be used to skip past a test that would
otherwise fail.  A linear-bounded Turing machine is sufficient to recognize
accepting computation histories.

This result allows us to prove that &lt;math&gt;ALL_{PDA}&lt;/math&gt;, the language
of pushdown automata which accept all input, is undecidable.  Suppose
we have a decider for it, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;.  For any Turing machine
&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and input &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, we can form the pushdown automaton
&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; which accepts non-accepting computation histories for that
machine.  &lt;math&gt;D(P)&lt;/math&gt; will accept if and only if there are no
accepting computation histories for &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;; this
would allow us to decide &lt;math&gt;A_{TM}&lt;/math&gt;, which we know to be undecidable.

'''CyberPatriot''' is the National Youth Cyber Education Program created to help direct students toward careers in [[cybersecurity]] or other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The program, created by the [[Air Force Association]] (AFA), features the National Youth Cyber Defense Competition for high school and middle school students.

Now in its eleventh season, CyberPatriot XI is open to all high schools, middle schools, and accredited home school programs around the country. [[JROTC]] units of all Services, [[Civil Air Patrol]] squadrons, and [[Naval Sea Cadet Corps]] divisions may also participate in the competition.  Outside of the regular competition, CyberPatriot also hosts two additional sub-programs: Summer CyberCamps&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/special-initiatives/afa-cybercamp-program/program-overview|title=2018 AFA CyberCamp Program Overview|website=www.uscyberpatriot.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an Elementary School Cyber Education Initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/special-initiatives/afa-cybercamp-program/standard-afa-cybercamp-information|title=Standard AFA CyberCamp Information|website=www.uscyberpatriot.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Northrop Grumman]] Foundation is the presenting sponsor. A spin off program is run in the UK called [[Cyber Centurion]].

==History==
CyberPatriot began in 2009 as a proof of concept demonstration at AFA’s Air Warfare Symposium in Orlando, Florida. Nine high school [[Civil Air Patrol]] squadrons competed.  The second phase of the program was limited to Air Force [[JROTC|AFJROTC]] and Civil Air Patrol teams. Online training and qualification competitions were held during fall 2009 with nearly 200 teams from 44 states competing for eight slots to the in-person National Finals Competition in February 2010, held in Orlando, Florida. The final phase of the developmental program, full national deployment, is now underway. Over 1,500 teams from all 50 states, Canada, and DoD Dependant schools overseas competed in CyberPatriot VI. CyberPatriot VII began in October 2014, with over 2,100 teams registered to compete. A new division, the Middle School Division, has been added this season. CyberPatriot IX, started in October 2016, featured over 4,300 registered teams.

==Goals and objectives==

CyberPatriot, is designed to be accessible to any high school or middle school student, provides a path from high school to college and the workforce, and benefits all CyberPatriot partners and our nation. The program increases the awareness of cybersecurity by delivering a basic cybersecurity education in a competitive format that enhances leadership, communication, and cooperation skills among its competitors.

==Organization and preparation==

Teams have the following members:
* Coach: Supervises, chaperones team. Usually a teacher. Does not need to have a technical background.  
* Competitors: 2-6 students (5 competitors, 1 alternate)
* Technical Mentor (Optional):  Particularly useful when coach is not cyber-savvy. Helps teach cyber concepts.
* Team Assistant (Optional): Assistants Coach with daily administrative tasks related to the competition

Each team is required to have a registered Coach and registered Competitors. Coach registration begins in the late spring to allow preparation over the summer. The qualification rounds of the competition are completed online at the teams’ home locations from September to early January.

== Competition guidelines ==
The competition is a tournament structure with three divisions:
# Open High School Division:  Open to all public, private, parochial, magnet, charter, home schools, and special groups such as CampFire, Boys &amp; Girls Club, Boy Scouts, Church Youth Groups, Girl Scouts, etc.
# All-Service Division: Open to all JROTC Services, Civil Air Patrol squadrons, US Naval Sea Cadet Corps units. The registration fee is waived for teams competing in the All-Service Division
# Middle School Division: Open to all middle schools and junior high schools which follow the same common organizations as mentioned above in the Open High School Division.

The early rounds of the competition are done online during weekends via the Internet from teams’ schools or other sponsoring organizations’ facilities. Prior to the round, teams download virtual image representations of operating systems with known flaws, or cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each team is tasked to find the flaws while keeping specified computer functions (services such as email) working. Team progress is recorded by a central CyberPatriot scoring system.

The scores from Qualification Rounds 1 and 2 are totaled to determine which tier a team advances to:

*Platinum: Top 30% of teams. Rounds include State (guaranteed), Semifinals, and National Finals
*Gold: Middle 40% of teams. Rounds include State (guaranteed) and Semifinals.
*Silver: Bottom 30% of teams. Rounds include State (guaranteed) and Semifinals.

Teams in the Platinum tier are the only teams eligible to qualify for National Finals.

See additional rules below:

* The Qualification Competition begins as soon as this image is opened, and ends 6 consecutive hours later, after which the score will be logged. Attempting to continue after the time limit has reached will incur penalties. It is the coach's responsibility to ensure their team does not exceed the limit.
* Only one instance of the image can be open at any given time. Opening multiple instance of a virtual image will result in a penalty.
* No person may compete on a team with which they are not registered, and may only be registered with one team per competition.
* During the competition, no outside assistance may be given to or received from anyone.
* No competitor may offer assistance to another after their round ends and the others begins.
* No outside communication is allowed during the competition. This includes but is not limited to verbal, electronic, written or coded.
* No offensive activity of any kind is permitted, including but not limited to hacking through programs or manual code injection, interfering with another team through social engineering and/or deception, or attaining the opposing machine.

==National Finals Competition==

The top scoring Semifinal teams from each division, approximately 28 teams, are invited (all-expenses paid) to the in-person National Finals Competition each spring.  For CyberPatriot IV - VII, National Finals Competitions was held at the Gaylord National Hotel and Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland. Beginning the CyberPatriot VIII season, the National Finals Competitions moved to the Hyatt Regency in Inner Harbor, Baltimore, Maryland.

The Challenges that teams may face include:

# Network Security Master Challenge, in which teams fix vulnerabilities in "images" of Operating Systems that have been purposely tampered with while protecting the "images" from "Red Team" which is a group of "hackers" that will unfix vulnerabilities and mess with the competitors.
# Leidos Digital Forensics Challenge, in which teams solve mysteries with computer programs.
# Digital Crime Scene Challenge, in which teams search a live "crime scene" for digital evidence.
# Cisco Networking Challenge, in which teams show their knowledge about Wiring, Cisco's Packet Tracer, and in a Cisco quiz.

Winning teams in the Open and All Service Division earn education grants to the school of their choice. First place teams earn $2,000 per competitor, second place teams earn $1,500 per competitor, and third place earns $1,000 per competitor. The scholarship money is provided by Northrop Grumman Corp. In CyberPatriot VII, for first, second, and third place, an additional $2,000, $1,500, and $1,000 were awarded to the teams, respectively, by the National Security Agency.

A '''Development Effectiveness Indicator''' (DEI) is a consolidated measure, used primarily by [[Development_finance_institution|Development Finance Institutions (DFIs)]], of the development effectiveness achieved by an institution. This measure relates directly to the development results achieved through a particular development intervention or financed activity. The DEI is a composite aggregation of a range of performance measures that may incorporate interventions across various sectors within the development arena. The formulation of a development effectiveness indicator was motivated primarily by the limitations of current development effectiveness reviews and the need to provide a dynamic adaptive mechanism to track effectiveness and provide operational and strategic insight. The indicator was produced by Jason Bygate and Karl Meyer in 2016 in South Africa for emerging markets.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept used in [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]]. It refers to the two-level structure inherent to a [[sign system]], insofar as it is composed by two kinds of elements: 1) significant or meaningful, and 2) distinctive or meaningless.

==Theory==
''Double articulation''&lt;ref&gt;Occasionally also "double segmentation".&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the two fold structure of the stream of speech, which can be primarily divided into ''meaningful'' signs (like words or [[morphemes]]), and then secondarily into ''distinctive'' elements (like letters or [[phonemes]]). For example, the meaningful English word "cat" is composed of the sounds [k], [æ], and [t], which are meaningless as separate individual sounds (and which can also be combined to form the separate words "tack" and "act", with distinct meanings). These sounds, called [[phonemes]], represent the secondary and lowest level of articulation in the hierarchy of the organization of speech. Higher, primary, levels of organization (including [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], and [[semantics]]) govern the combination of these individually meaningless phonemes into meaningful elements.

==History==
The French concept of ''double articulation'' was first introduced by the [[André Martinet]],&lt;ref&gt;André Martinet, ''Éléments de linguistique générale'', Colin, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1949. The English calque ''double articulation'' has been criticised as inaccurate and is often replaced by ''duality of patterning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3935606 | pmid=24587833 | doi=10.1515/langcog-2012-0014 | volume=4 | title=New perspectives on duality of patterning: Introduction to the special issue | year=2012 | journal=Lang Cogn | pages=251–259 | last1 = de Boer | first1 = B | last2 = Sandler | first2 = W | last3 = Kirby | first3 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Charles F. Hockett]] and other linguists, this duality is an important property of human languages, since it allows for the expression of a potentially infinite number of meaningful language sequences. Strictly speaking, however, such expressiveness follows from [[generativity]] or [[Productivity_(linguistics)|productivity]] (a finite number of components combining via rules to produce a potentially infinite arrangement of novel utterances), not of duality per se (one could have a system with 2 levels of the kind referred to as duality, and yet have only finite productivity. For further discussion, see [[figurae]], as well as [[Hockett's_design_features]], which treats productivity and duality as distinct essential properties of language.

[[Sign language]]s may have less double articulation because more gestures are possible than sound and able to convey more meaning without double articulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sedivy|first1=Julie|title=The Unusual Language That Linguists Thought Couldn’t Exist|url=http://nautil.us/blog/the-unusual-language-that-linguists-thought-couldnt-exist|website=Nautilus|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21449">'''Engineering management''' is the application of the practice of [[management]] to the practice of [[engineering]].

Engineering management is a career that brings together the technological problem-solving ability of [[engineering]] and the organizational, administrative, and planning abilities of [[management]] in order to oversee the operational performance of complex engineering driven enterprises. A [[Master of Engineering Management]] (MEM) is sometimes compared to a [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) for professionals seeking a graduate degree as a qualifying credential for a career in engineering management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gordon.tufts.edu/programs/m-s-in-engineering-management/msem-vs-mba|title=MSEM vs. MBA - Gordon Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Stevens Institute of Technology]] is believed to have the oldest engineering management department, established as the School of Business Engineering in 1908. This was later called the Bachelor of Engineering in Engineering Management (BEEM) program and moved into the School of Systems and Enterprises. Drexel University established the first graduate engineering management degree in the U.S., which was first offered in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drexel.edu/egmt/about/history/|title=History - Engineering Management|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 the first university department explicitly titled "Engineering Management" was founded at the [[Missouri University of Science and Technology]] (Missouri S&amp;T, formerly the University of Missouri-Rolla, formerly Missouri School of Mines). In 1959, [[Western Michigan University]] began offering the predecessor to the modern engineering management bachelor's degree (titled "Industrial Supervision") and in 1977, WMU started its MS degree in Manufacturing Administration, later renamed as Engineering Management. 

Outside the USA, in Germany the first department concentrating on Engineering Management was established 1927 in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vwi.org/hauptmenue/beruf-studium/wirtschaftsingenieurwesen/geschichte-und-bedeutung.html|title=Geschichte und Bedeutung - vwi.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Turkey the [[Istanbul Technical University]] has a Management Engineering Department established in 1982, offering a number of graduate and undergraduate programs in Management Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.end.itu.edu.tr/tarihce.html&lt;/ref&gt; In UK the [[University of Warwick]] has a specialised department [[Warwick Manufacturing Group|WMG]] (previously known as [[Warwick Manufacturing Group]]) established in 1980, which offers a graduate programme in MSc Engineering Business Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/education/wmgmasters/courses/masters_engineering_business_management|title=MSc Engineering Business Management - University of Warwick|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michigan Technological University]] began an Engineering Management program in the School of Business &amp; Economics in the Fall of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtu.edu/registrar/students/major-degree/audit/business/|title=School of Business Audit Forms - The Registrar's Office|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] has started a complete master's degree Program in Engineering Management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engr.mun.ca/graduate/course/mem.php Master of Engineering Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Denmark, the [[Technical University of Denmark]] offers a MSc program in Engineering Management (in English).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/msc/Programmes/engineering_management MSc in Engineering Management].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Pakistan, [[University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila]], [[University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore]] and [[National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan|National University of Science and Technology]] (NUST) offer admission both at Master and Doctorate level in Engineering Management while [[Capital University of Science &amp; Technology]] (CUST), NED University of Engineering &amp; Technology, Karachi and Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology have been running a Master of Engineering/MS in Engineering Management program. A variant of this program is within Quality Management. COMSATS (CIIT) offers a MSc Project Management program to Local and Overseas Pakistanis as an on-campus/off-campus student.

In Italy, [[Politecnico di Milano]] offers degrees in Management Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dig.polimi.it/index.php?id=37&amp;L=2|title=Studies in Management, Economics and Industrial Engineering|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia, since 2014 the Faculty of Engineering Management of The [[Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration]] (RANEPA) offers bachelor and master degrees in Engineering Management.

In France, the  [http://www.epf.fr/en EPF] will offer, from January 2018, a 2 year Engineering &amp; Management major in English for the 4th and 5th years of its 5 year Engineering Master’s degree.  The final 2 years are open to students who have completed an undergraduate engineering degree elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epf.fr/en/studies/majors/engineering-management-major-paris-campus EPF:Engineering Management Paris Campus]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas==

=== Operations management, operations research, and supply chain management ===
[[Operations management]] is concerned with designing and controlling the process of production and redesigning business operations in the production of goods or services. [[Operations research]] deals with quantitative models of complex operations and uses these models to support [[decision-making]] in any sector of industry or public services. [[Supply chain management]] is the process of planning, implementing and managing the flow of goods, services and related information from the point of origin to the point of consumption.&lt;ref name="UWMGTE"&gt;[http://www.mansci.uwaterloo.ca/mgte/index.php University of Waterloo], Management Engineering.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Management of technology ===
The [[Technology management|Management of Technology]] (MOT) theme builds on the foundation of management topics in [[accounting]], [[finance]], [[economics]], [[organizational behavior]] and organizational design. Courses in this theme deal with operational and organizational issues related to managing [[innovation]] and technological change.&lt;ref name="UWMGTE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gordon.tufts.edu/programs/m-s-in-engineering-management/program-structure|title=Program Structure - Gordon Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New product development and product engineering ===
[[New product development]] (NPD) is the complete process of bringing a new product to market. [[Product engineering]] refers to the process of designing and developing a device, assembly, or system such that it be produced as an item for sale through some production manufacturing process. Product engineering usually entails activity dealing with issues of cost, producibility, quality, performance, reliability, serviceability, intended lifespan and user features. [[Project Management]] techniques are used to manage the design and development progress using the [[phase-gate model]] in the product development process. [[Design for manufacturability]] (also sometimes known as design for manufacturing or DFM) is the general engineering art of designing products in such a way that they are easy to manufacture.

=== Systems engineering ===
[[Systems engineering]] is an interdisciplinary field of engineering and engineering management that focuses on how to design and manage complex systems over their life cycles.

=== Industrial engineering ===
[[Industrial engineering]] is a branch of engineering which deals with the optimization of complex processes, systems or organizations. Industrial engineers work to eliminate waste of time, money, materials, man-hours, machine time, energy and other resources that do not generate value.

=== Management science ===
[[Management science]] uses various scientific research-based principles, strategies, and analytical methods including [[mathematical modeling]], statistics and numerical algorithms to improve an organization's ability to enact rational and meaningful management decisions by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems

==Education==
Engineering management programs typically include instruction in [[accounting]], [[economics]], [[finance]], [[project management]], [[systems engineering]], [[industrial engineering]], [[mathematical model]]ing and optimization, [[management information systems]], [[quality control]] &amp; [[six sigma]], [[operations management]], [[operations research]], [[human resources management]], industrial [[psychology]], [[safety]] and [[health]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/cip2000/occupationallookup6d.ASP?CIP=15.1501 U.S. Department of Education Institute of Education Sciences: Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP)] - Retrieved on October 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://atmae.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=227&amp;Itemid=48 ATMAE Membership Venn Diagram] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113190247/http://atmae.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=227&amp;Itemid=48 |date=2013-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many options for entering into engineering management, albeit that the foundation requirement is an [[engineering degree]] (or other [[computer science]], [[mathematics]] or [[science]] degree) and a [[business degree]].

'''Undergraduate degrees'''

Although most engineering management programs are geared for graduate studies, there are a few elite institutions that teach EM at the undergraduate level.  Some of the ones that are accredited and/or recognized by ASEM include: West Point ([[United States Military Academy]]), [[Norwich University]], [[Western Michigan University]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wmich.edu/edmms/academics/undergraduate/engmanagementtech&lt;/ref&gt; (ABET-accredited by ETAC of ABET), [[New York Institute of Technology]], [[Stevens Institute of Technology]], [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], [[George Washington University]], [[Arizona State University]], [[Missouri University of Science and Technology]]. Graduates of these programs regularly command nearly $65,000 their first year out of school.&lt;ref name="Stevens Institue of Technology"&gt;{{cite web|title=Accepted Salary Offers |url=http://www.stevens.edu/sit/admissions/careers/2010-Career-Outcomes.cfm |work=Class of 2010 Career Outcomes |accessdate=18 May 2011 |author=Stevens Institute of Technology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409114519/http://www.stevens.edu/sit/admissions/careers/2010-Career-Outcomes.cfm |archivedate=9 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the USA, [[Istanbul Technical University]] Management Engineering Department offers an undergraduate degree in Management Engineering,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isl.itu.edu.tr/isletmeLisansProgramlarEN.htm&lt;/ref&gt; attracting top students. The [[University of Waterloo]] offers a 4-year undergraduate degree (5 years including co-op education) in the field of Management Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mansci.uwaterloo.ca/mgte/index.php Management Engineering]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first program of its kind in Canada. In Peru, Pacifico University offers a five-year undergraduate degree in this field, the first program in this country. In Germany, [[ESB Business School]]&lt;ref&gt;[[ESB Business School]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}} offers a 4-year undergraduate program which consists of five semesters at [[ESB Business School]], two mandatory internships, one is mandatory to be in another country than Germany, and also one mandatory semester abroad. In the annual applied university ranking of the magazine [[Wirtschaftswoche]], the [[Engineering Management]] course of [[ESB Business School]] is ranked on place five of all applied universities in Germany&lt;ref&gt;https://www.esb-business-school.de/fakultaet/aktuelles/detail/artikel/bwl-absolventen-der-esb-auf-platz-eins/&lt;/ref&gt;. The magazine surveyed more than 500 recruiters in the German industry from which university they are most likely to recruit students and which universities satisfy their needs regarding experience in working with projects, multilingual education, and ability to communicate most.

'''Graduate degrees'''
{{main|Master of Engineering Management}}
Many universities offer Master of Engineering Management degrees. Missouri S&amp;T is credited with awarding the first Ph.D. in Engineering Management in 1984. The [[National Institute of Industrial Engineering]] based in [[Mumbai]] has been awarding degrees in the field of Post Graduate Diploma in Industrial Engineering since 1973 and the Fellowship (Doctoral) degrees have been awarded since 2008. 

[[Western Michigan University]] began offering the MS in Manufacturing Administration degree in 1977 and later renamed the degree as Master of Science in Engineering Management&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wmich.edu/ieeem/academics/masters&lt;/ref&gt;. WMU's MSEM alumni work in the automotive, medical, manufacturing, and service sectors, often in roles of project manager, engineering manager, and senior leadership in engineering and technical organizations.

Cornell University started one of the first Engineering Management Masters programs in 1988 with the launch of their Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) in Engineering Management. The program allows students access to courses and programs in the College of Engineering, Johnson School of Management, and across Cornell University more broadly. 

Netaji Subhas Institute of technology (NSIT, website as http://www.nsit.ac.in/ under University of Delhi)New Delhi also provides M.tech degree in Engineering management.Admission to this program happens through GATE(Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering)examination.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology offers a Master in System Design and Management, which is a member of the Consortium of Engineering Management.

Students in the University of Kansas' Engineering Management Program are practicing professionals employed by over 100 businesses, manufacturing, government or consulting firms. There are over 200 actively enrolled students in the program and approximately 500 alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emgt.ku.edu/key-aspects|title=Key Aspects - Engineering Management|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Istanbul Technical University]] Management Engineering Department offers a graduate degree,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isl.itu.edu.tr/isletmeYuksekLisansProgramlarEN.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and a Ph.D. in Management Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isl.itu.edu.tr/isletmeDoktoraProgramlarEN.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[American Society for Engineering Education]] (ASEE) PRISM Magazine (March 2008) the largest Master's of Engineering Management (MEM) programs (in terms of degrees awarded for 2005–2006) are shown in the following chart.

==Management engineering consulting==
Large and small engineering driven firms often require the expertise of external [[management consultant]]s that specialize in companies where engineering practice and product development are key drivers of value.  Most engineering management consultants will have as a minimum a [[professional engineering]] qualification.  But usually they will also have graduate degrees in engineering and or business or a [[management consulting]] designation.  It involves providing [[management consulting]] service that is specific to professional [[engineering]] practice or to the engineering industry sector.  Engineering management consultancies, are typically boutique firms and have a more specialized focus than the traditional mainstream consulting firms, [[A T Kearney]], [[Boston Consulting Group]], [[KPMG]], [[PWC]], and [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]]. [[Applied science]] and [[engineering]] practice requires a holistic approach involving a combination of management art, science, and engineering practice. There are many professional service companies delivering services in a consultancy type relationship to the engineering industry, including [[law]], [[accounting]], [[human resources]], [[marketing]], [[politics]], [[economics]], [[finance]], [[Public administration|public affairs]], and [[communication]].  Commonly, engineering management consultants are used when firms require a combination of special [[Technology|technical]] knowledge, and [[management]] know how, to enhance [[knowledge]] or transform organizational performance and also keep any [[intellectual property]] developed confidential.

Engineering management consulting is concerned with the development, improvement, implementation and evaluation of integrated systems of organizations, people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy, materials and/or processes.  Management Engineering Consultants strive to improve upon existing organizations, processes, products or systems. Engineering management consulting draws upon the principles and methods of engineering analysis and synthesis, as well as the mathematical, physical and [[social sciences]] together with the principles and methods of engineering design to specify, predict, and evaluate the results to be obtained from such systems or processes. Engineering management consulting can focus on the social impact of the product, process or system that is being analyzed.  There is also an overlap between engineering management consulting and [[management science]] in services that require the adoption of more analytical approaches to problem solving.

Examples of where engineering management consulting might be used include developing and leading a company wide [[business transformation]] initiative, or designing and implementing a [[new product development]] process, designing and implementing a [[manufacturing engineering]] process, including an automated assembly workstation.  Management engineers may specialize in the acquisition and implementation of [[Computer aided design]] (CAD), [[Computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) and [[Computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) applications.  Services may include strategizing for various operational logistics, new product introductions, or consulting as an efficiency expert.  It may include using [[management science]] techniques to develop a new financial algorithm or loan system for a bank, streamlining operation and emergency room location or usage in a hospital, planning complex distribution schemes for materials or products (referred to as [[Supply Chain Management]]), and shortening lines (or [[queueing theory|queues]]) at a bank, hospital, or a theme park.  Management engineering consultants typically use [[computer simulation]] (especially [[discrete event simulation]]), along with extensive mathematical tools and modeling and computational methods for system analysis, evaluation, and optimization.

==Professional organizations==
There are a number of societies and organizations dedicated to the field of engineering management. One of the largest societies is a division of IEEE, the Engineering Management Society, which regularly publishes a trade magazine. Another prominent professional organization in the field is the American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM), which was founded in 1979 by a group of 20 engineering managers from industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asem.org|title=American Society for Engineering Management - Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ASEM currently certifies engineering managers (two levels) via the Associate Engineering Manager (AEM) or Professional Engineering Manager (PEM) certification exam. The Master of Engineering Management Programs Consortium is a newly formed consortium of prominent universities intended to raise the value and visibility of the MEM degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mempc.org Master of Engineering Management Programs Consortium ]&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, engineering management university programs have the possibility of being accredited by [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology|ABET]], [[Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering|ATMAE]], or ASEM. In Canada, the Canadian Society for Engineering Management (CSEM) is a constituent society of the Engineering Institute of Canada (EIC), Canada's oldest learned engineering society.

[[File:EscolArtOlot.JPG|thumb|left|265px|School's building]]
'''Escola d'Art i Superior de Disseny d'Olot''' is the main Design and Arts &amp; Crafts school of the region of [[Province of Girona|Girona]] ([[Catalonia]], Spain). Since its foundation, it has maintained an active participation in the social, educational, economic and cultural life. The school is in [[Olot]], a city with a population of over 34,000 inhabitants.

==History==
The School was founded as '''Fine Arts School''' on 1 July 1783 by Bishop Tomas Lorenzana. In 1891 was renamed as '''Minor Fine Arts' School''', and during the period 1934–1938 was designed as '''Landscape's School''', depending on the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]].

During the 1986–87 academic year the official teaching of applied arts and crafts began, according to the official plan for 1963 schools; the school at this time depended on Olot's City Council.

On 20 June 1990 the school became part of the Catalonia official network of art schools with the name of '''Escola d'Arts Applicades i Oficis Artístics d'Olot'''; human resources and management switched to the Generalitat de Catalunya.

Since the 2003–2004 academic year the school has become '''Escola d'Art i Superior de Disseny d'Olot''', by completing the training with a Bachelor in Interior Design. Since the 2007–08 academic year the school also teaches a Bachelor of Graphic Design. Since 2010–11 it became one of seven ESDAP (Escola Superior de Disseny i Arts Plàstiques) and began to teach undergraduate Design (adapted to the [[European Higher Education Area]]).

==Location==

The institution is at the "Claustres del Carme" building, the Carmelite Cloisters, which date back to the Renaissance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13574">[[File:Wainwright building st louis USA.jpg|thumb|The [[Wainwright Building]] in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]], designed by [[Louis Sullivan]], is emblematic of his famous maxim "form follows function".|300x300px]]
'''Form follows function''' is a principle associated with 20th-century [[modern architecture|modernist architecture]] and [[industrial design]] which says that the shape of a building or object should primarily relate to its intended function or purpose.

== Origins of the phrase ==
The architect [[Louis Sullivan]] coined the [[Saying|maxim]], although it is often incorrectly attributed to the sculptor [[Horatio Greenough]] (1805{{en dash}}1852),&lt;ref&gt;Horatio Greenough, ''Form and Function: Remarks on Art'', edited by Harold A. Small (Berkeley, Univ. of California Press, 1947), although the theory of inherent forms, of which the ijaz phrase is a fitting summary, informs all of Greenough's writing on art, design, and architecture.

Greenough was in his architectural writings influenced by the [[transcendentalist]] thinking and the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] protestantism of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].&lt;/ref&gt; whose thinking mostly predates the later [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] approach to architecture. Greenough's writings were for a long time largely forgotten, and were rediscovered only in the 1930s. In 1947, a selection of his essays was published as ''Form and Function: Remarks on Art by Horatio Greenough''.

Sullivan was Greenough's much younger compatriot, and admired rationalist thinkers such as [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]], [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]], and [[Herman Melville|Melville]], as well as Greenough himself. In 1896, Sullivan coined the phrase in an article titled ''The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/tallofficebuildi00sull|title=The tall office building artistically considered|last=Sullivan|first=Louis H.|date=1896|others=Getty Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he later attributed the core idea to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] architect, engineer, and author [[Marcus Vitruvius Pollio]], who first asserted in his book ''[[De architectura]]'' that a structure must exhibit the three qualities of firmitas, utilitas, venustas – that is, it must be solid, useful, beautiful.&lt;ref name="idea"&gt;{{cite book |title=Autobiography of an Idea |last=Sullivan |first=Louis |year=1924 |publisher=Press of the American institute of Architects, Inc. |location=New York City |page=108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan actually wrote "form ever follows function", but the simpler and less emphatic phrase is more widely remembered. For Sullivan this was distilled wisdom, an aesthetic credo, the single "rule that shall permit of no exception". The full quote is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
"Whether it be the sweeping eagle in his flight, or the open apple-blossom, the toiling work-horse, the blithe swan, the branching oak, the winding stream at its base, the drifting clouds, over all the coursing sun, '''''form ever follows function''''', and this is the law.  Where function does not change, form does not change. The granite rocks, the ever-brooding hills, remain for ages; the lightning lives, comes into shape, and dies, in a twinkling. 
It is the pervading law of all things organic and inorganic, of all things physical and metaphysical, of all things human and all things superhuman, of all true manifestations of the head, of the heart, of the soul, that the life is recognizable in its expression, '''that form ever follows function.''' ''This is the law.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sullivan | first=Louis H. | title=The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered | journal=Lippincott's Magazine | issue=March 1896 | pages=403–409 | year=1896 |url= https://archive.org/details/tallofficebuildi00sull }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sullivan developed the shape of the tall steel [[skyscraper]] in late 19th Century [[Chicago]] at a moment in which technology, taste and economic forces converged and made it necessary to break with established styles. If the shape of the building was not going to be chosen out of the old pattern book, something had to determine form, and according to Sullivan it was going to be the purpose of the building. Thus, "form follows function", as opposed to "form follows precedent". Sullivan's assistant [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] adopted and professed the same principle in a slightly different form—perhaps because shaking off the old styles gave them more freedom and latitude.

== Debate on the functionality of ornamentation ==

In 1908, the Austrian architect [[Adolf Loos]] wrote an allegorical essay titled "[[Ornament and Crime]]" in reaction to the excessive invented ornament used by the [[Vienna Secession]] architects. Modernists adopted Loos's moralistic argument as well as Sullivan's maxim. Loos had worked as a carpenter in the USA. He celebrated efficient plumbing and industrial artifacts like corn silos and steel water towers as examples of functional design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Loos, A.|year=1908|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~art/Temporary_SL/177/pdfs/Loos.pdf|title=Ornament and Crime|location=Innsbruck, reprint Vienna, 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=May 2014}}

== Application in different fields ==

=== Architecture ===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}
The phrase '''"form (ever) follows function"''' became a [[battle cry]] of Modernist architects after the 1930s. The credo was taken to imply that decorative elements, which architects call "ornament", were superfluous in modern buildings. However, Sullivan himself neither thought nor designed along such lines at the peak of his career. Indeed, while his buildings could be spare and crisp in their principal masses, he often punctuated their plain surfaces with eruptions of lush [[Art Nouveau|art nouveau]] and [[Celtic Revival|celtic revival]] decorations, usually cast in iron or terracotta, and ranging from organic forms like vines and ivy, to more geometric designs, and interlace, inspired by his Irish design heritage. Probably the most famous example is the writhing green ironwork that covers the entrance canopies of the [[Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building]] on South State Street in Chicago. These ornaments, often executed by the talented younger draftsman in Sullivan's employ, would eventually become Sullivan's trademark; to students of architecture, they are his instantly recognizable signature.

=== Product design ===

One episode in the history of the inherent conflict between functional design and the demands of the marketplace took place in 1935, after the introduction of the streamlined [[Chrysler Airflow]], when the American auto industry temporarily halted attempts to introduce optimal aerodynamic forms into mass manufacture. Some car-makers thought aerodynamic efficiency would result in a single optimal auto-body shape, a "teardrop" shape, which would not be good for unit sales.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Meikle's "Twentieth Century Limited:  Industrial Design in America, 1925 &amp;ndash; 1939"&lt;/ref&gt; [[General Motors]] adopted two different positions on streamlining, one meant for its internal engineering community, the other meant for its customers. Like the annual model year change, so-called aerodynamic styling is often meaningless in terms of technical performance. Subsequently, [[drag coefficient]] has become both a marketing tool and a means of improving the sale-ability of a car by reducing its fuel consumption, slightly, and increasing its top speed, markedly.

The American industrial designers of the 1930s and '40s like [[Raymond Loewy]], [[Norman bel Geddes]] and [[Henry Dreyfuss]] grappled with the inherent contradictions of "form follows function" as they redesigned blenders and locomotives and duplicating machines for mass-market consumption. Loewy formulated his &lt;span id="MAYA"&gt;"MAYA" (Most Advanced Yet Acceptable)&lt;/span&gt; principle to express that product designs are bounded by functional constraints of math and materials and logic, but their acceptance is constrained by social expectations. His advice was that for very new technologies, they should be made as familiar as possible, but for familiar technologies, they should be made surprising.

By honestly applying "form follows function", industrial designers had the potential to put their clients out of business.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Some simple single-purpose objects like screwdrivers and pencils and teapots might be reducible to a single optimal form, precluding [[product differentiation]]. Some objects made too durable would prevent sales of replacements. (''cf.'' [[planned obsolescence]]) From the standpoint of functionality, some products are simply unnecessary.

[[Victor Papanek]] (died 1998) was an influential recent designer and design philosopher who taught and wrote as a proponent of "form follows function."

=== Software engineering ===
It has been argued that the structure and internal quality attributes of a working, non-trivial software artifact will represent first and foremost the engineering requirements of its construction, with the influence of process being marginal, if any. This does not mean that process is irrelevant, but that processes compatible with an artifact's requirements lead to roughly similar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle can also be applied to Enterprise Application Architectures of modern business where "function" is the Business processes which should be assisted by the enterprise architecture, or "form". If the architecture dictates how the business operates then the business is likely to suffer from inflexibility unable to adapt to change. SOA [[Service-Oriented Architecture]] enables an [[Enterprise Architect]] to rearrange the "form" of the architecture to meet the functional requirements of a business by adopting standards based communication protocols which enable interoperability.

Furthermore, [[Domain-Driven Design]] postulates that structure ([[Software architecture]], [[Design Pattern]], [[Implementation]]) should emerge from constraints of the modeled domain ([[Functional requirement]]).

While "form" and "function" may be more or less explicit and invariant concepts to the many engineering doctrines, [[Metaprogramming]] and the [[Functional programming]] paradigm lend themselves very well to explore, blur and invert the essence of those two concepts.

The [[Agile software development]] movement espouses techniques such as 'test driven development' in which the engineer begins with a minimum unit of user oriented functionality, creates an automated test for such and then implements the functionality and iterates, repeating this process. The result and argument for this discipline are that the structure or 'form' emerges from actual function and in fact because done organically, makes the project more adaptable long term as well of as higher quality because of the functional base of automated tests.

=== Automobile designing ===

If the design of an automobile conforms to its function—for instance the [[Fiat Multipla]]'s shape, which is partly due to the desire to sit six people in two rows—then its form is said to follow its function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://europe.autonews.com/article/19990719/ANE/907190815/multipla-designer-shows-that-form-follows-function|title=MULTIPLA DESIGNER SHOWS THAT FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION|work=Automotive News|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolution ===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}
According to [[Lamarck]]'s long-discredited [[Lamarckism|theory of evolution]], anatomy will be structured according to functions associated with use; for instance, [[giraffe]]s are taller to reach the leaves of [[tree]]s. By contrast, in [[evolution|Darwinian evolution]], form ([[mutation|variation]]) ''precedes'' function (as determined by [[natural selection|selection]]). This is to say, in Lamarckian evolution the form is altered by the required function, whereas in Darwinian evolution small variations in form allow some parts of the population to function "better", and are therefore more successful reproductively.

== Early life and education ==
Tilman (born Titman)&lt;ref name=titmanphd/&gt; was born in Aurora, Illinois in 1949. He earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[zoology]] in 1971 and his [[PhD]] in ecology in 1976 at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref name=PNAS/&gt;&lt;ref name=titmanphd&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=George David|last=Titman |title=Interspecific competition for resources: An experimental and theoretical study |publisher=University of Michigan |date=1968 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/302806650 |website=proquest.com|oclc=68285554}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his doctoral research was published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref name=Titman1976&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Titman|first1=George David|title=Ecological Competition Between Algae: Experimental Confirmation of Resource-Based Competition Theory|journal=Science|volume=192|issue=4238|year=1976|pages=463–465|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.192.4238.463|pmid=17731084|bibcode=1976Sci...192..463T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career and research==
In an August 2001 interview, Tilman states that his passion with ecology stems from his love for both math and biology, and ecology is a field that allows him to express both together along with his love for the outdoors.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.in-cites.com/scientists/dr-david-tilman.html |website=in-cites |title= An Interview with Dr. David Tilman |year = 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His work explores how both natural and managed ecosystems can be used to meet the needs of humans, whether it be for food, energy, or [[ecosystem services]].  Tilman has performed several studies to further determine the usefulness of grasslands for utilization in [[biofuel]].&lt;ref name=googlescholar/&gt;

=== Resource competition===
Tilman is best known for his work on the role of resource [[competition (biology)|competition]] in community structure and on the role of [[biodiversity]] in ecosystem functioning.&lt;ref name=resource/&gt;  One of his most cited articles is the 1994 ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' article on the ''Biodiversity and stability in grasslands'' which provided data regarding an experiment that began in 1982 with more than 200 plots in a grassland field in the [[Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve]] in [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref name=TilmanDowning1994&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tilman|first1=David|last2=Downing|first2=John A.|title=Biodiversity and stability in grasslands|journal=Nature|volume=367|issue=6461|year=1994|pages=363–365|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/367363a0|bibcode=1994Natur.367..363T}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these plots was continuously monitored for 20 years for factors such as [[species richness]] and [[biomass]] created by the community. Tilman’s article looked at data both prior to and following a drought on the grassland plots in 1988, which provided surprising results.  The drought provided substantial [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] and the biomass data showed a strong positive [[correlation]] between the plant diversity within the community and the stability of the community as a whole supporting the [[Ecological effects of biodiversity|diversity-stability hypothesis]].&lt;ref name=learner/&gt;

"The level to which the soil solution concentration of a limiting resource is reduced by an equilibrial monoculture of a species is called R*. R* is the resource concentration a species requires for it to be able to persist in a habitat. A comparable concept, that of threshold density, exists for host-microparasite inter-actions. The species with the lowest R* for a limiting soil resource is predicted to be the superior competitor for that resource."&lt;ref name=learner&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tilman|first1=David|title=Constraints and Tradeoffs: Toward a Predictive Theory of Competition and Succession|journal=[[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]]|volume=58|issue=1|year=1990|pages=3|issn=00301299|doi=10.2307/3565355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to [[ecological succession|succession]] he focuses on resource ratios, particularly between light and nitrogen. After a big disturbance, the pattern of succession is from high light/low nitrogen towards high nitrogen/low light environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bazzaz|first=F. A.|title=Plants in Changing Environments|year=1996|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=UK|isbn=9 780521 398435|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competition and biodiversity===
Another article by Tilman that has received substantial citation{{fact|date=May 2017}} is his 1994 ''[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]]'' article that encompasses the idea that large numbers of species can coexist in a small habitat even when they require the same [[limiting nutrient]] (such as nitrogen), as long as there is a tradeoff between the species.  Basically it means that they can coexist because species that are good [[competitors]] are not as good at colonizing or reproducing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/biblio/fulltext/t1180.pdf | last1 = Tilman | first1 = David | title = Competition and Biodiversity in Spatially Structured Habitats | journal = Ecology | volume = 75 | year = 1994 | pages = 2–16 | doi=10.2307/1939377}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a related paper, Tilman used this model to demonstrate the phenomenon of "[[extinction debt]]," which refers to the time delay between habitat destruction and the extinction of species.&lt;ref name=Tilman1994&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tilman | first1 = D. | last2 = May | first2 = R.

===Awards and honors===
In 2014, he received the [[BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award]] in the Ecology and Conservation Biology category, for scientifically establishing the value of biodiversity, quantifying, for the first time, how it contributes to make ecosystems more productive, more resilient to invasions, and more stable in the face of perturbations such as drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fbbva.es/TLFU/tlfu/ing/microsites/premios/fronteras/galardonados/2014/ecologia.jsp|title=BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Awards|website=www.fbbva.es|access-date=2016-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a [[Guggenheim Fellow]], is a Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] and of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and is a member of the [[National Academy of Science]].&lt;ref name = PNAS&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davis |first1=T.H. |title=Biography of David Tilman |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |year=2004 |volume=101 |number=30 |pages=10851–10853 |bibcode=2004PNAS..10110851D |doi=10.1073/pnas.0404605101 |pmid=15263082|pmc=503709}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 Tilman was designated the ''Most Highly Cited Environmental Scientist of the Decade'' by Essential Science Indicators.&lt;ref name = PNAS/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13731">'''Genre criticism''', a method within [[rhetorical criticism]], analyzes texts in terms of their genre: the set of generic expectations, conventions, and constraints that guide their production and interpretation. In [[rhetoric]], the theory of [[genre]] provides a means to classify and compare artifacts in terms of their formal, substantive and contextual features. By grouping artifacts with others which have similar formal features or rhetorical exigencies, rhetorical critics can shed light on how authors use or flout conventions for their own purposes. Genre criticism has thus become one of the main methodologies within rhetorical criticism. 

Literary critics have used the concepts of genres to classify speeches and works of literature since the time of [[Aristotle]], who distinguished three rhetorical genres: the [[Forensic rhetoric | legal or judicial]], the [[Deliberative rhetoric | deliberative]] or political, and the ceremonial or [[epideictic]].  Since then, rhetorical approaches to genre and understanding of the term "genre" have evolved in several ways. New genres have been studied for their rhetorical effectiveness - like sermons, letters, and (more recently) non-verbal genres like political cartoons, film, and public monuments.  Further contemporary genre criticism has revised understanding of genre in several ways. The first [[turn (disambiguation) | turn]], represented by [[Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin]] (1895-1975), among others, focused on the formal features of communication. The second turn, represented by Carolyn Miller, among others, focused on recurring socio-cultural circumstances. In the latest turn, critics have begun applying formalist and socio-cultural concepts to [[new media | new-media]] artifacts that tend to resist classification into traditional genre-categories.

== Emphasis on formal features in speech genres==
The first group of rhetorical critics, following the example of theorists like [[M. M. Bakhtin]], used formal features to analyze texts. For these critics, language is formed through a series of utterances that reflect specific conditions and goals of certain linguistic aspects. These aspects include thematic content, style, and compositional structure which form speech genres. Speech genres are diverse because of the various possibilities of human activity. In "The Problem of Speech Genres" (1986), Mikhail Bakhtin draws attention to the very significant difference between primary (simple) and secondary (complex) speech genres.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, M. M. (1986). [https://books.google.com/books?id=_LO_agE_GTcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The Problem of Speech Genres"]. ''Speech genres and other late essays''. Trans. V. W. McGee. University of Texas Press. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bahktin, primary speech genres form secondary speech genres and examples of secondary speech genres include novels, dramas, all kinds of scientific research, and major genres of commentary. Since these secondary genres involve complex and comparatively highly developed and organized cultural communication that is artistic and scientific, they absorb and digest various primary genres that have taken form in mediated speech communion. Bakhtin continues to explain that there are three factors of the whole utterance which include semantic exhaustiveness of the theme, the speaker’s plan or speech will, and the typical compositional and generic forms of finalization.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, ''Speech genres and other late essays'', p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; The first factor refers to the way utterances are used within speech which is linked to the second factor of how the speaker determines to use the utterance.The third factor explains that all our utterances have definite and stable typical forms of construction, but that these forms can change when needed. As Bahktin writes, "These genres are so diverse because they differ depending on the situation, social position, and personal interrelations of the participants in the communication".&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, ''Speech genres and other late essays'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical approaches to genre==
The word “[[genre]]” is derived from the [[Latin]] term ''genus'', to mean “kind”, “class” or "sort".

[[Aristotle]] was one of the first scholars to develop a rhetorical approach to genre. He divided the art of rhetoric into three genres: [[deliberative]], [[forensic]], and [[epideictic]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, F.I (1995). "The Rhetoric of Aristotle". ''A Synoptic History of Classical Rhetoric'' (2nd rev. ed.), Davis, CA. Hermagoras Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The deliberative genre of rhetoric involves speeches or writing meant to persuade an audience to take action. Deliberative rhetoric thus includes rhetoric that is used for political persuasion, discusses matters of public policy in order to determine what is advantageous or disadvantageous, and is usually concerned with the future. Rhetoric of the [[forensic]] genre questions guilt or innocence, is concerned with legalities, and concentrates on events that occurred in the past. The [[epideictic]] genre of rhetoric encompasses all rhetoric used for ceremonial and commemorative purposes. Epideictic rhetoric praises and blames, acknowledging that which is noble or shameful, honorable or dishonorable. 

The [[rhetorical situation]] is a concept important for understanding rhetorical approaches to genre and the creation of new genres.&lt;ref&gt;Bitzer, L.F. (1968). "The rhetorical situation". ''Philosophy and Rhetoric'', vol. 1, pp. 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Campaign speeches are an example of how rhetorical situations recur, producing sedimented genres. As a result of the institutions that execute the [[U.S. Constitution]], every four years at the time of presidential elections, candidates deliver campaign speeches. Campaign speeches have become a distinct genre because they respond to highly similar situations that recur because of a structural or institutional basis.

U.S. rhetoricians [[Karlyn Kohrs Campbell]] and [[Kathleen Hall Jamieson]] refer to genre as a “constellation of elements."&lt;ref name="Kathleen Hall Jamieson 1978"&gt;Karlyn Kohrs Campbell and Kathleen Hall Jamieson (1978), ''Form and Genre: Shaping Rhetorical Action''. The Speech Communication Association. Falls Church, VA. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; They say, “A genre is a group of acts unified by a constellation of forms that recurs in each of its members.” Genres are formed when examined constituents are similar. The metaphors of genres as “constellations” serves to explain how genres, like constellations of stars, are constructed of individual members, but are under the influence of each other and outside elements. As a result they move together and remain in a similar relation to each other despite their ever-changing positions.&lt;ref name="Kathleen Hall Jamieson 1978"/&gt; According to Campbell and Jamieson, “when a generic claim is made, the critical situation alters significantly because the critic is now arguing that a group of discourses has a synthetic core in which certain significant rhetorical elements, e.g., a system of belief, lines of argument, stylistic choices, and the perception of the situation, are fused into an indivisible whole".&lt;ref name="Kathleen Hall Jamieson 1978"/&gt;

Many contemporary scholars refer to the fusion of traits from different genres in speeches and texts as a "generic [[Hybrid genre|hybrid]]".&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, K.M.; Campbell, K.K. (1982). "Rhetorical hybrids: "'Fusion of generic elements'". ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' (68), pp. 146-157.&lt;/ref&gt; These generic hybrids can be formed from a blend of the three rhetorical genres.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Rhetoric'', (Trans. W.R. Roberts, 1954), New York: Modern Library.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept can be explained through an example of a generic hybrid of deliberative and epideictic elements, in which a newly elected President delivers an inaugural address. The President is speaking at a formal ceremony recognizing the current state of the nation (characteristic of the epideictic genre), while simultaneously announcing his policy plans for the upcoming four years. 

U.S. rhetorician Carolyn R. Miller is the author of the article "Genre as Social Action" (1984). She argues, “Rhetorical criticism has not provided firm guidance on what constitutes a genre” and a “rhetorically sound definition of genre must be centered not on the substance or the form of discourse but on the action it is used to accomplish.” &lt;ref name="Miller 1984"&gt; Miller, C. R. (1984). "Genre as social action." ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' (70), pp. 151-67.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller also argues that new media genres may develop and formalize more quickly than traditional, written genres. She is among other rhetoricians who have expressed concerns about the appropriateness of traditional genre theory for new media communication. They argue that because genre theory originally was developed for describing written texts, the theory should be modified to account for nonlinguistic communication. Miller and colleague Dawn Shepherd illustrate an example of applying socio-cultural theories to genre studies in "Blogging as Social Action: A Genre Analysis of the Weblog". They explain how the weblog may be establishing a new genre because of its integration of current social and cultural trends.&lt;ref name ="blogging"&gt;Miller, C. R.; Shepherd, D.(2004). [http://blog.lib.umn.edu/blogosphere/blogging_as_social_action.html "Blogging as Social Action: A Genre Analysis of the Weblog"], Into the Blogosphere. Retrieved 10 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-cultural approach to genre studies==
In the 1980s, scholarship in genre theory and criticism has turned towards a socio-cultural approach to the study of genre by actively interrogating the rhetorical situation of a given communication artifact in light of its particular generic form. In this mode of inquiry, the rhetorical artifact is examined as a social response to a set of recurrent rhetorical exigencies rather than a collection of formal, generic elements. In the rhetorical tradition of genre criticism, Carolyn R. Miller's work on the socio-cultural approach to genre theory has been influential. Again in her 1984 journal article, Miller argues that “rhetorical criticism has not provided firm guidance on what constitutes a genre” and that a “rhetorically sound definition of genre must be centered not on the substance or the form of discourse but on the action it is used to accomplish”.&lt;ref name="Miller 1984"/&gt; Later, when Miller and Shepherd engaged the socio-cultural approach to genre criticism in “Blogging as Social Action: A Genre Analysis of the Weblog” (2004), they exposed some of the difficulties of applying genre theory to new media. In their analysis, Miller and Shepherd examine the extent to which the weblog might constitute a genre in light of its interaction with current social and cultural trends.

==Genres studies in new media==
Recently scholars and researchers in [[rhetoric]], [[linguistics]], and [[information sciences]] have begun to explore the relationships between new media and socio-contextual genre theories (like those of Carolyn Miller, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Charles Bazerman). These researchers have expressed concerns about the appropriateness of traditional genre theory for new media communication. Some scholars have argued that since genre theory was originally developed to describe written texts, the theory needs to be modified to account for nonlinguistic communication. Linguist and semiotician Gunter Kress suggested that much of the vocabulary of generic analysis is ill-equipped to address non-written communication, arguing that “there are no genre terms for describing what [a] drawing is or does…” &lt;ref&gt;Kress, G. &amp; Van Leeuwen, T (1996). ''Multimodal Discourse''. London: Routledge. p.110.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, rhetoricians Miller and Shepherd have argued that traditional written genre theory does not appropriately address the visual features of a genre’s format.&lt;ref name="blogging"/&gt;

Rhetoricians and [[Information science|information scientists]] have also pointed out that new media genres may develop and formalize more quickly than traditional written genres. The authors of the article "Genres and the web" argue that the personal home page is functioning as a new and discrete genre, and they explore the entirely digital nature of home pages, suggesting that home pages “have no obvious paper equivalent”.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Andrew; Gushrowski, Barbara A. (2000). "Genres and the web: Is the personal home page the first uniquely digital genre?" ''[[Journal of the American Society for Information Science]]'', 51(2), pp. 202-205.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally recent work in new media genre theory has explored how new communication technologies allows for forms of “genre [[hybridity]].” Spinuzzi, for example, explores what can happen when multiple related genres are [[Remediation (Marxist theory)|remediated]] into a single new media artifact.&lt;ref name="Clay Spinuzzi 2003"&gt;Spinuzzi, C. (2003). ''Tracing genres through organizations: A sociocultural approach to information design''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Freedman''' ([[Brooklyn]], New York, USA, 6 March 1936 - Sydney, NSW, Australia, 21 July 2016) was Australia's ''leading'' Interior Designer/ Interior Architect from 1970 until a younger generation became prominent in Sydney during the 1990s. Born in New York, where he studied architecture at Syracuse University, Freedman arrived in Sydney in 1968 and later designed many prestigious interiors, often including custom-made furniture. His notable interior schemes included executive suites for the Bank of New South Wales (1970) and the State Bank of NSW (1985), cultural institutions including Sydney's Powerhouse Museum/Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences (1988), businesses, government premises, restaurants, residences and historic monuments, including a refurbishment of the Queen Victoria Building shopping centre (2009)[3].

In 2005, Freedman was described by The Sydney Morning Herald as ‘the Godfather of Interior Design’. He was recognised by design and architecture industry experts for his daring and widely emulated combinations of colours, inventive uses of materials, attention to detail, and commitment to high-quality furnishings (often imported signature classics)[5]. He was respected also for his sophisticated understandings of optical perception and volumetric manipulations of interior space. For this reason he was highlighted by design writers as practising more like an architect than his colleagues who were educated as interior decorators and designers[6]. Although he never finalised his American degree studies to register as an architect, Freedman worked repeatedly with Sydney's leading architects of the late-twentieth century—including Glenn Murcutt, Peter Stronach, Richard Johnson and Ken Woolley. He also trained some of Sydney's outstanding younger architects and designers—including Iain Halliday, Sam Marshall, Stephen Varady, William MacMahon, Arthur Collin, Robert Puflett, Tim Allison and his late-career partner, Ralph Rembel. In 2005 the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (NSW Chapter) awarded Freedman Rembel an Interior Architecture commendation for its design of executive offices at the AMP Insurance building overlooking Circular Quay.

Freedman's 1970s and 1980s furniture designs, often finished with luxury European veneers and eye-catching flourishes, were often promoted in Australia's most stylish design magazines, especially Belle and Interior Design. His cocktail trolley for Bilson's restaurant (1988) is in the collection of Sydney's Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences. He was a Fellow of the Design Institute of Australia and the Academy of Design Australia.

==Early life==

Freedman was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Nathan Freedman, a colour designer for an American paint manufacturer, and Rose Freedman (née Hirsch). His childhood memories included riding horses in Manhattan's Central Park, and their home interior paint colour was changed every second year to challenging new colours.

==Education==

From 1949 to 1953, Freedman attended Manhattan High School, then studied architecture at Syracuse University and began working from 1960 with architects Kahn and Jacobs, where he worked on the American Airlines’ first class lounge at John F. Kennedy Airport. He abandoned the final year of his degree to travel to Europe; initially Ibiza, with a friend. During 1963 and 1964, he exhibited and sold artworks in Amsterdam and Brussels, then worked as an interior designer for architects Tandy Halford and Mills in London.
Returning to New York in 1968, Freedman joined the international planning unit of leading furniture manufacturers and interior designers Knoll and Associates. He worked with director Florence Knoll, who maintained close ties with many European and American leaders of modern design. Freedman's projects with Knoll included the United States pavilion for the 1970 Osaka World Fair and offices for accountants Price Waterhouse in Buffalo, NY.

==Life in Australia==

In 1969, Knoll despatched Freedman to Sydney to ‘Manhattanise and Internationalise’ the executive and boardrooms for the Bank of New South Wales, one of Australia's oldest banks (founded in 1817 and renamed Westpac in 1982).

While working on this project, Freedman began a personal relationship with prominent Sydney decorator Neville Marsh—who employed him as a designer with Neville Marsh Interiors in 1970. To exploit Freedman's international experience, they agreed that the practice should ‘go modern’, and in 1973, the business was rebranded Marsh Freedman Associates (MFA).

As well as designing interiors for some of Sydney's most prestigious and prosperous families, MFA created sophisticated fine dining rooms for some of Sydney's outstanding restaurateurs, notably Anne Taylor (Taylors, 1984); Tony and Gay Bilson (Berowra Waters Inn, 1976; Kinselas, 1983; Tresury, 1992, and Ampersand, 1998; Damien and Josephine Pignolet (Claudes, 1981); Helen and Malcolm Spry (Chez Oz, 1985); Leon Fink (Bilsons and Quay, 1986, 1988), and Armando Percuoco (Buon Ricordo Ristorante refurbishment, 2007).

During the late 1980s, Neville Marsh retired from Marsh Freedman Associates and Freedman continued to practice as George Freedman Associates (with Robert Chester and Sam Marshall). In 2002 he appointed a younger architect, Ralph Rembel, as his business partner and renamed the practice 'Freedman Rembel'. This practice was dissolved in 2010, when Freedman joined architects Peddle Thorp and Walker as Head of Interior Design (but he continued consulting to his existing private clients).

==Personal life==

Freedman was widely known for his waspish wit, warm laugh, home cooking, Negroni's, and devotion to his dogs (owned in pairs shared). During the 1990s Freedman was caring for Neville Marsh and supported by Andrew Bryan. In 2005 he met and later exchanged vows in Paris with psychologist Peter O'Brien. In 2014 they had a formal same sex wedding in New Zealand. Freedman died from cancer in Sydney in 2016, aged 80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amy|first1=Ripley|title=George Freedman, interior designer to the rich and famous of Sydney|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/george-freedman-interior-designer-to-the-rich-and-famous-of-sydney-20160811-gqqc4n.html|website=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''H-Net''' ("Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Online") is an interdisciplinary forum for scholars in the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]. It is best known for hosting [[electronic mailing list]]s organized by [[academic discipline]]s; according to the organization's website, H-Net lists reach over 100,000 subscribers in more than 90 countries.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/about/ |title=About H-Net |publisher=H-net.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The H-Net Network has grown until it is now endorsed by many academic professional organizations.{{cn|date=October 2012}} Its over 180 topic- or discipline-specific lists are often the primary internet forum for scholars.{{cn|date=October 2012}}  Individual lists are "edited by a team of scholars";&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; each has a board of editors.

In addition to its email lists, H-Net provides three related online services:
*H-Net Reviews: reviews of books and other publications, commissioned and published on its website and through its [[listserv]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/home.php |title=H-Net Reviews |publisher=H-net.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*H-Net Job Guide: academic position announcements, available on its website and through email&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.h-net.org/jobs/home.php |title=H-Net Job Guide |publisher=H-net.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

H-Net is hosted by the Department of History at [[Michigan State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.msu.edu/humanities-technology/ |title=The Department of History and Humanities Technology |publisher=[[Michigan State University]] |accessdate=2012-10-20 |quote=Michigan State is also the home of H-Net, an international academic organization that offers over a hundred email discussion lists along with the leading online repositories for book reviews, job postings, and academic announcements |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018153500/http://history.msu.edu/humanities-technology/ |archivedate=2012-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion networks==
Many of the lists deal with various areas of historical study. Within two years of its founding, H-Net was recognized as being "among the most dynamic and effective contributions" to the internationalization of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Steven A. Leibo, [http://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/1995/9505/9505NOT1.cfm "H-Net and the Internationalization of Scholarship,"] ''Perspectives: The Newsletter of the American Historical Association'', 33: 5 (May–June 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
H-Net began in 1992 as an initiative of Prof. [[Richard J. Jensen]] of the History department at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], to assist historians "to easily communicate current research and teaching interests; to discuss new approaches, methods and tools of analysis; to share information on access to library catalogs and other electronic databases; and to test new ideas and share comments on current historiography."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jensen, "H-Net announces 13 new scholarly lists in history," [http://lists.village.virginia.edu/lists_archive/Humanist/v07/0073.html E-Mail of 24 Jun 1993]; Thomas Zielke, "Official Introduction of The History Network " [http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/subject/hd/fak7/hist/c1/de/gen/gen/grmnhist/log.started930201/mail-20.html E-Mail on GRMNHIST - German History Forum, 23 Feb 93] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107015905/http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/subject/hd/fak7/hist/c1/de/gen/gen/grmnhist/log.started930201/mail-20.html |date=2007-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; H-Net is now organized as an international consortium of scholars in the humanities and social sciences and its networks are hosted by [[Michigan State University]].

In 2010, the H-Net president is historian [[Jean A. Stuntz]] of [[West Texas A&amp;M University]].

[[Image:Gradient2.svg|thumb|300px|Two types of gradients, with blue arrows to indicate the direction of the gradient. Dark areas indicate higher values]]
[[File:Blue-green-gradient.jpg|thumb|300x300px|A blue and green [[color gradient]].]]
An '''image gradient''' is a directional change in the intensity or color in an image. The gradient of the image is one of the fundamental building blocks in [[image processing]]. For example, the [[Canny edge detector]] uses image gradient for [[edge detection]]. In [[graphics software]] for [[digital image editing]], the term gradient or [[color gradient]] is also used for a gradual blend of [[color]] which can be considered as an even [[wiktionary:gradation|gradation]] from low to high values, as used from white to black in the images to the right. Another name for this is ''color progression''.

Mathematically, the [[gradient]] of a two-variable function (here the image intensity function) at each image point is a 2D [[vector (geometric)|vector]] with the components given by the [[derivative]]s in the horizontal and vertical directions. At each image point, the gradient vector points in the direction of largest possible intensity increase, and the length of the gradient vector corresponds to the rate of change in that direction.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, David. "Image gradients." Class Notes for CMSC 426 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the intensity function of a digital image is only known at discrete points, derivatives of this function cannot be defined unless we assume that there is an underlying [[continuous function|continuous]] intensity function which has been sampled at the image points. With some additional assumptions, the derivative of the continuous intensity function can be computed as a function on the sampled intensity function, i.e., the digital image. Approximations of these derivative functions can be defined at varying degrees of accuracy. The most common way to approximate the image gradient is to [[convolution|convolve]] an image with a kernel, such as the [[Sobel operator]] or [[Prewitt operator]].

Image gradients are often utilized in [[map]]s and other visual representations of [[data]] in order to convey additional information. [[Geographic information system|GIS]] tools use color progressions to indicate [[elevation]] and [[population density]], among others.

== Computer vision ==

[[File:Intensity image with gradient images.png|thumb|400px|alt=Left: Black and white picture of a cat. Center: The same cat, displayed in a gradient image in the x direction. Appears similar to an embossed image. Right: The same cat, displayed in a gradient image in the y direction. Appears similar to an embossed image.|On the left, an intensity image of a cat. In the center, a gradient image in the x direction measuring horizontal change in intensity. On the right, a gradient image in the y direction measuring vertical change in intensity. Gray pixels have a small gradient; black or white pixels have a large gradient.]]

Image gradients can be used to extract information from images. Gradient images are created from the original image (generally by convolving with a filter, one of  the simplest being the [[Sobel filter]]) for this purpose. Each pixel of a gradient image measures the change in intensity of that same point in the original image, in a given direction. To get the full range of direction, gradient images in the x and y directions are computed.

One of the most common uses is in edge detection. After gradient images have been computed, pixels with large gradient values become possible edge pixels. The pixels with the largest gradient values in the direction of the gradient become edge pixels, and edges may be traced in the direction perpendicular to the gradient direction. One example of an edge detection algorithm that uses gradients is the [[Canny edge detector]].

Image gradients can also be used for robust feature and texture matching. Different lighting or camera properties can cause two images of the same scene to have drastically different pixel values. This can cause matching algorithms to fail to match very similar or identical features. One way to solve this is to compute texture or feature signatures based on gradient images computed from the original images. These gradients are less susceptible to lighting and camera changes, so matching errors are reduced.

== Math ==
The gradient of an image is a vector of its [[partial derivative|partials]]:&lt;ref name=dip3&gt;{{cite book |last=Gonzalez |first=Rafael |author2=Richard Woods |title=Digital Image Processing |url=http://www.imageprocessingplace.com/DIP-3E/dip3e_main_page.htm |edition=3rd |publisher=Pearson Education, Inc. |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-13-168728-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|165}}

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f=\begin{bmatrix}
g_{x} \\
g_{y}
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;,

where:

:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt; is the derivative with respect to x (gradient in the x direction)

:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}&lt;/math&gt; is the derivative with respect to y (gradient in the y direction).

The [[derivative]] of an image can be approximated by [[finite differences]]. If central difference is used, to calculate &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}&lt;/math&gt; we can apply a 1-dimensional filter to the image &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; by [[Kernel (image processing)#Convolution|convolution]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \begin{bmatrix} 
-1 \\
+1 
\end{bmatrix} * \mathbf{A}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; denotes the 1-dimensional convolution operation. This 2&amp;times;1 filter will shift the image by half a pixel. To avoid this, the following 3&amp;times;1 filter
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} 
-1 \\
0 \\
+1 
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
can be used. The gradient direction can be calculated by the formula:&lt;ref name=dip3 /&gt;{{rp|706}}

:&lt;math&gt;\theta =  \operatorname{tan{^-}{^1}} \left [ \frac{g_{y}}{g_{x}} \right ]&lt;/math&gt;,

and the magnitude is given by:&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/MARBLE/low/edges/gradient.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{g_{y}^{2} + g_{x}^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Dr. '''J. Halcombe "Hal" Laning, Jr.''' (February 14, 1920 in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/1953 1953: Information from Answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; May 29, 2012) was a [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] computer pioneer who in 1952 invented an algebraic compiler called George (also known as the [[Laning and Zierler system]] after the authors of the published paper) that ran on the MIT [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]], the first real-time computer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/sts1/pages/computer.html NASA - The Flight of STS-1: Computer]&lt;/ref&gt; Laning designed George to be an easier-to-use alternative to [[assembly language]] for entering mathematical equations into a computer.  The concepts he introduced with George were later incorporated into [[FORTRAN]].&lt;ref&gt;Mindell, David, DIGITAL APOLLO, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 2008, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; He later became a key contributor to the 1960s race to the moon, with pioneering work on space-based guidance systems for the [[Apollo missions|Apollo moon missions]]. From 1955 to 1980, he was deputy associate director of the [[MIT Instrumentation Laboratory]].

In 1956 he published the book ''Random Processes in Automatic Control'' (McGraw-Hill Series on Control System Engineering), with Richard Battin as a coauthor.

In collaboration with Phil Hankins and Charlie Werner of MIT, he initiated work on MAC (MIT
Algebraic Compiler), an algebraic programming language for the IBM 650, which was completed by early spring of 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guidance system]]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Career==
Laning received his PhD from MIT in 1947 with a dissertation titled "Mathematical Theory of Lubrication-Type Flow".&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=33485|name=J. Halcombe Laning, Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt; His undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering (1940) was also from MIT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webmuseum.mit.edu/detail.php?t=people&amp;type=browse&amp;f=preferred_name&amp;s=Laning%2C+J.+Halcombe&amp;record=0 MIT Museum Collections - People]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected to the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in 1983 for his work in [[aerospace engineering]], particularly his "unique pioneering achievements in missile guidance and computer science -- the [[Q-guidance]] system for [[Thor missile|Thor]] and [[polaris missile|Polaris]] [missiles] and George".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nae.edu/nae/naepub.nsf/Members+By+UNID/91CB3C1EF7430AFF8625755200622AE5?opendocument |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528132256/http://www.nae.edu/nae/naepub.nsf/Members+By+UNID/91CB3C1EF7430AFF8625755200622AE5?opendocument |archivedate=May 28, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an honorary member of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ams.org/notices/199512/from.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Laning features prominently in the third episode of the [[Science Channel]]'s [[documentary]] miniseries titled [[Moon_machines#Part_3:_Guidance_Computer|Moon Machines]] which aired in June 2008.

=== Apollo Program ===

He later worked in the MIT [[Draper Lab]], with [[Richard Battin|Richard H. Battin]], to develop a scheme for doing onboard navigation on the [[Apollo program]]'s [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command/service module]] [[guidance systems|guidance system]].  He designed the Executive and Waitlist operating system for the [[apollo guidance computer|LGC]] (Lunar Module Guidance Computer) in the mid 1960s; he made it up from whole cloth with no examples to guide him, and the design is still valid today. The allocation of functions among a sensible number of asynchronous processes, under control of a rate and priority-driven preemptive executive, still represents the state of the art in real-time GN&amp;C computers for spacecraft.  His design saved the Apollo 11 landing mission when the rendezvous radar interface program began using more register core sets and "Vector Accumulator" areas than were physically available in memory, causing the infamous 1201 and 1202 errors.  Had it not been for Laning's design the landing would have been aborted for lack of a stable guidance computer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://klabs.org/history/apollo_11_alarms/eyles_2004/eyles_2004.htm Tales From The Lunar Module Guidance Computer]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jon Allen Seger''' is an American evolutionary [[ecologist]], and Distinguished Professor of Biology at the [[University of Utah]].&lt;ref name="uprofile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biology.utah.edu/faculty2.php?inum%3D2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609193500/http://www.biology.utah.edu/faculty2.php?inum=2 |archivedate=2010-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped develop the theory of [[Bet-hedging (biology)|bet-hedging]] in biology. His work has appeared in leading scientific journals such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', ''[[Nature Genetics]]'', ''[[Molecular Biology and Evolution]]'', ''[[Journal of Evolutionary Biology]]'', as well as popular magazines such as ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=experts-random-mutations&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Dr. Seger attended [[UC Santa Barbara]] for his undergraduate studies, where he received a B.A. in English in 1969. Following college, he worked at the [[National Museum of Natural History]] on an assignment to help the museum establish public environmental education programs.&lt;ref name="uprofile"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution 1970|url=https://archive.org/stream/smithsonianyear7071smit/smithsonianyear7071smit_djvu.txt|website=archive.org|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|accessdate=19 May 2017|location=City of Washington|language=en|date=30 June 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then enrolled at [[Harvard University]], where he received his [[Master of Education|EdM]] in 1972 and his PhD in Biology in 1980. Much of his early work concerned models of sex ratio evolution and a variety of social insects (such as the Vespidae wasps). This work often took the form of mathematical models built from 'first principles' (such as his 1986 paper written with Robert Trivers). Following his PhD he held [[postdoctoral]] positions at the [[University of Sussex]] (1981-1982), the [[University of Michigan]] (1982-1983), and [[Princeton University]] (1983–86).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jon Seger|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/316/|website=MacArthur Foundation|language=en|date=1 July 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the faculty at the [[University of Utah]] in 1986.

==Career==
His latest work concerns applications of coalescent theory to population genetics, particularly the mtDNA of whale lice, although members of his lab work on a variety of applied and theoretical topics that range from evolutionary ecology and genetics to mathematical biology and coalescent theory. In addition, he recently received an NSF grant to continue his work on the so-called "missing heritability" problem. His whale lice work had already shown that a genome should have lots of weakly deleterious mutations of small effect taken on their own but potentially large effect when taken together. This implies that the "missing" genes sought by, for example, human geneticists aren't actually missing: there are simply a lot more genes have a very small effect on fitness by themselves but have can have a large effect when the effects are combined.

'''Law''' is a [[system]] of rules that are created and [[law enforcement|enforced through social or governmental institutions]] to regulate [[behavior]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Robertson, ''Crimes against humanity'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined both as  "the [[soft science|Science]] of Justice" and "the [[the arts|Art]] of Justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/basharubin/2015/01/13/is-law-an-art-or-a-science-a-bit-of-both/ | title=Is Law an Art or a Science?: A Bit of Both}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=oR0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA525&amp;dq=Roman+ars+boni+et+aequi | title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law| isbn=9780871694324| last1=Berger| first1=Adolf| year=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Law is a system that regulates and ensures that individuals or a community adhere to the will of the state. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective [[legislature]] or by a single legislator, resulting in [[statute]]s, by the executive through [[decree]]s and [[regulation]]s, or established by judges through [[precedent]], normally in [[common law]] jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding [[contract]]s, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a [[constitution]], written or tacit, and the [[rights]] encoded therein. The law shapes [[politics]], [[economics]], [[history]] and [[society]] in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.

A general distinction can be made between (a) [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[jurisdiction]]s, in which a legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates their laws, and (b) [[common law]] systems, where judge-made [[precedent]] is accepted as [[Legally binding|binding]] law. Historically, [[religious law]]s played a significant role even in settling of secular matters, and is still used in some religious communities. Islamic [[Sharia law]] is the world's most widely used religious law, and is used as the primary legal system in some countries, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/law-and-politics/spotlight-on-law/what-is-sharia-law|title=What is sharia law?|work=brightknowledge.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019060625/http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/law-and-politics/spotlight-on-law/what-is-sharia-law/|archivedate=19 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adjudication of the law is generally divided into two main areas.

== Definition ==
{{Main|Definition of law|Analytical jurisprudence}}

=== Mainstream definitions ===
Numerous definitions of ''law'' have been put forward over the centuries. The ''Third New International Dictionary'' from Merriam-Webster&lt;ref&gt;''Third New International Dictionary'', Merriam-Webster, Inc., Springfield, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; defines law as: "Law is a binding custom or practice of a community; a rule or mode of conduct or action that is prescribed or formally recognized as binding by a supreme controlling authority or is made obligatory by a [[sanction (law)|sanction]] (as an edict, decree, rescript, order, ordinance, statute, resolution, rule, judicial decision, or usage) made, recognized, or enforced by the controlling authority."

The ''Dictionary of the History of Ideas'' published by Scribner's in 1973 defined the concept of law accordingly as: "A legal system is the most explicit, institutionalized, and complex mode of regulating human conduct. At the same time, it plays only one part in the congeries of rules which influence behavior, for social and moral rules of a less institutionalized kind are also of great importance."&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of the History of Ideas'', Charles Scribner's Sons, Editor Philip P. Weiner, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Whether it is possible or desirable to define law ===
There have been several attempts to produce "a universally acceptable definition of law". In 1972, one source indicated that no such definition could be produced.&lt;ref name="Jurisprudence. Third Edition 1972. Page 39"&gt;[[Lord Lloyd of Hampstead]]. ''Introduction to Jurisprudence''. Third Edition. Stevens &amp; Sons. London. 1972. Second Impression. 1975. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; McCoubrey and White said that the question "what is law?" has no simple answer.&lt;ref&gt;Mc Coubrey, Hilaire and White, Nigel D. ''Textbook on Jurisprudence''. Second Edition. [[Blackstone Press Limited]]. 1996. {{ISBN|1-85431-582-X}}. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glanville Williams]] said that the meaning of the word "law" depends on the context in which that word is used. He said that, for example, "[[early customary law]]" and "[[municipal law]]" were contexts where the word "law" had two different and irreconcilable meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Glanville. International Law and the Controversy Concerning the Meaning of the Word "Law". Revised version published in Laslett (Editor), ''Philosophy, Politics and Society'' (1956) p. 134 et seq. The original was published in (1945) 22 [[British Year Book of International Law|BYBIL]] 146.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thurman Arnold]] said that it is obvious that it is impossible to define the word "law" and that it is also equally obvious that the struggle to define that word should not ever be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Thurman. ''The Symbols of Government''. 1935. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to take the view that there is no need to define the word "law" (e.g. "let's forget about generalities and get down to [[Case law|cases]]").&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Lloyd of Hampstead]].

[[File:Milkau Oberer Teil der Stele mit dem Text von Hammurapis Gesetzescode 369-2.jpg|thumb|King [[Hammurabi]] is revealed the [[Code of Hammurabi|code of laws]] by the Mesopotamian sun god [[Shamash]], also revered as the god of justice.]]

The history of law links closely to the development of [[civilization]]. [[Ancient Egypt]]ian law, dating as far back as 3000&amp;nbsp;BC, contained a civil code that was probably broken into twelve books. It was based on the concept of [[Ma'at]], characterised by tradition, [[rhetoric]]al speech, social equality and impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Théodoridés|title = law | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VerSteeg, ''Law in ancient Egypt''&lt;/ref&gt; By the 22nd century&amp;nbsp;BC, the ancient [[Sumer]]ian ruler [[Ur-Nammu]] had formulated the first [[Code of Ur-Nammu|law code]], which consisted of [[Casuistry|casuistic]] statements ("if … then ..."). Around 1760&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Hammurabi|King Hammurabi]] further developed [[Babylonian law]], by codifying and inscribing it in stone. Hammurabi placed several copies of his law code throughout the kingdom of Babylon as [[Stele|stelae]], for the entire public to see; this became known as the [[Code of Hammurabi|Codex Hammurabi]]. The most intact copy of these stelae was discovered in the 19th century by British [[Assyriologists]], and has since been fully [[transliterated]] and translated into various languages, including English, Italian, German, and French.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''Hammurabi's Laws'', 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Old Testament]] dates back to 1280&amp;nbsp;BC and takes the form of moral imperatives as recommendations for a good society. The small [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city-state, ancient [[History of Athens|Athens]], from about the 8th century BC was the first society to be based on broad inclusion of its citizenry, excluding women and the [[slavery|slave]] class. However, Athens had no legal science or single word for "law",&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Short History of Western Legal Theory'', 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; relying instead on the three-way distinction between divine law (''thémis''), human decree (''nomos'') and custom (''díkē'').&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Mallory, "Law", in ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'', 346&lt;/ref&gt; Yet [[Ancient Greek law]] contained major [[Solonian Constitution|constitutional]] innovations in the development of [[Athenian democracy|democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Ober, ''The Nature of Athenian Democracy'', 121&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman law]] was heavily influenced by Greek philosophy, but its detailed rules were developed by professional jurists and were highly sophisticated.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Short History of Western Legal Theory'', 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries between the rise and decline of the [[Roman Empire]], law was adapted to cope with the changing social situations and underwent major codification under [[Theodosius II]] and [[Justinian I]].&lt;ref name="St107"&gt;As a legal system, Roman law has affected the development of law worldwide. It also forms the basis for the law codes of most countries of continental Europe and has played an important role in the creation of the idea of a common European culture (Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 2, 104–107).&lt;/ref&gt; Although codes were replaced by [[custom (law)|custom]] and [[case law]] during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], Roman law was rediscovered around the 11th century when medieval legal scholars began to research Roman codes and adapt their concepts. Latin [[legal maxim]]s (called [[brocard (law)|brocards]]) were compiled for guidance. In medieval England, royal courts developed a body of [[precedent]] which later became the [[common law]]. A Europe-wide [[Law Merchant]] was formed so that merchants could trade with common standards of practice rather than with the many splintered facets of local laws. The Law Merchant, a precursor to modern commercial law, emphasised the freedom to contract and alienability of property.&lt;ref&gt;Sealey-Hooley, ''Commercial Law'', 14&lt;/ref&gt; As [[nationalism]] grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Law Merchant was incorporated into countries' local law under new civil codes. The [[Napoleonic Code|Napoleonic]] and [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German]] Codes became the most influential. In contrast to English common law, which consists of enormous tomes of case law, codes in small books are easy to export and easy for judges to apply. However, today there are signs that civil and common law are converging.&lt;ref&gt;Mattei, ''Comparative Law and Economics'', 71&lt;/ref&gt; EU law is codified in treaties, but develops through the precedent laid down by the [[European Court of Justice]].

[[File:Constitution of India.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Constitution of India]] is the longest written constitution for a country, containing 444 articles, 12 schedules, numerous amendments and 117,369 words.]]

Ancient [[Law of India|India]] and [[Chinese law|China]] represent distinct traditions of law, and have historically had independent schools of legal theory and practice. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'', probably compiled around 100&amp;nbsp;AD (although it contains older material), and the ''[[Manusmriti]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;100–300&amp;nbsp;AD) were foundational treatises in India, and comprise texts considered authoritative legal guidance.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of the composition and dating of these sources, see Olivelle, ''Manu's Code of Law'', 18–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Manu's central philosophy was tolerance and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], and was cited across Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 276&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition, along with Islamic law, was supplanted by the common law when India became part of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 273&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia, Brunei, [[Law of Singapore|Singapore]] and [[Law of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] also adopted the common law. The eastern Asia legal tradition reflects a unique blend of secular and religious influences.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 287&lt;/ref&gt; Japan was the first country to begin modernising its legal system along western lines, by importing bits of the [[Code Civil|French]], but mostly the German Civil Code.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 304&lt;/ref&gt; This partly reflected Germany's status as a rising power in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century. Similarly, [[traditional Chinese law]] gave way to westernisation towards the final years of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in the form of six private law codes based mainly on the Japanese model of German law.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 305&lt;/ref&gt; Today [[Law of the Republic of China|Taiwanese law]] retains the closest affinity to the codifications from that period, because of the split between [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s nationalists, who fled there, and [[Mao Zedong]]'s communists who won control of the mainland in 1949. The current legal infrastructure in the People's Republic of China was heavily influenced by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Socialist law]], which essentially inflates administrative law at the expense of private law rights.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 307&lt;/ref&gt; Due to rapid industrialisation, today China is undergoing a process of reform, at least in terms of economic, if not social and political, rights. A new contract code in 1999 represented a move away from administrative domination.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 309&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, after negotiations lasting fifteen years, in 2001 China joined the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Farah, ''Five Years of China WTO Membership'', 263–304&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=left|quote=''"But what, after all, is a law? […] When I say that the object of laws is always general, I mean that law considers subjects en masse and actions in the abstract, and never a particular person or action. […] On this view, we at once see that it can no longer be asked whose business it is to make laws, since they are acts of the general will; nor whether the prince is above the law, since he is a member of the State; nor whether the law can be unjust, since no one is unjust to himself; nor how we can be both free and subject to the laws, since they are but registers of our wills."''|source=Jean-Jacques Rousseau, ''[[The Social Contract]]'', II, 6.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, ''The Social Contract'', [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/r/rousseau/jean_jacques/r864s/book2.html#section16 Book II: Chapter 6 (Law)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The philosophy of law is commonly known as (general) jurisprudence. Normative jurisprudence asks "what should law be?", while analytic jurisprudence asks "what is law?" [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]'s [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] answer was that law is "commands, backed by threat of sanctions, from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience".&lt;ref name="jap"&gt;Bix, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/austin-john/#3 John Austin]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural law]]yers on the other side, such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], argue that law reflects essentially moral and unchangeable laws of nature. The concept of "natural law" emerged in ancient [[Greek philosophy]] concurrently and in connection with the notion of justice, and re-entered the mainstream of [[Western culture]] through the writings of [[Thomas Aquinas]], notably his ''[[Treatise on Law]]''.

[[Hugo Grotius]], the founder of a purely rationalistic system of natural law, argued that law arises from both a social impulse—as Aristotle had indicated—and reason.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fritz Berolzheimer]], ''The World's Legal Philosophies'', 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]] believed a moral imperative requires laws "be chosen as though they should hold as universal laws of nature".&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant|Kant, Immanuel]], ''Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals'', 42 (par. 434)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeremy Bentham]] and his student Austin, following [[David Hume]], believed that this conflated the [[Is-ought problem|"is" and what "ought to be"]] problem. Bentham and Austin argued for law's [[legal positivism|positivism]]; that real law is entirely separate from "morality".&lt;ref&gt;Green, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-positivism/ Legal Positivism]&lt;/ref&gt; Kant was also criticised by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who rejected the principle of equality, and believed that law emanates from the [[will to power]], and cannot be labelled as "moral" or "immoral".&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''Zur Genealogie der Moral'', Second Essay, 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kazantzakis, ''Friedrich Nietzsche and the Philosophy of Law'', 97–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linarelli, ''Nietzsche in Law's Cathedral'', 23–26&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, the Austrian philosopher [[Hans Kelsen]] continued the positivist tradition in his book the ''[[Pure Theory of Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marmor, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lawphil-theory/ The Pure Theory of Law]&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsen believed that although law is separate from morality, it is endowed with "normativity", meaning we ought to obey it. While laws are positive "is" statements (e.g. the fine for reversing on a highway ''is'' €500); law tells us what we "should" do. Thus, each legal system can be hypothesised to have a basic norm (''[[Grundnorm]]'') instructing us to obey. Kelsen's major opponent, [[Carl Schmitt]], rejected both positivism and the idea of the [[rule of law]] because he did not accept the primacy of abstract normative principles over concrete political positions and decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Bielefeldt, ''Carl Schmitt's Critique of Liberalism'', 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Schmitt advocated a jurisprudence of the exception ([[state of emergency]]), which denied that legal norms could encompass all of political experience.&lt;ref name="F171"&gt;Finn, ''Constitutions in Crisis'', 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|Bentham's utilitarian theories remained dominant in law until the 20th century.]]

Later in the 20th century, [[H. L. A. Hart]] attacked Austin for his simplifications and Kelsen for his fictions in ''[[The Concept of Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bayles, ''Hart's Legal Philosophy'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; Hart argued law is a system of rules, divided into primary (rules of conduct) and secondary ones (rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules). Secondary rules are further divided into rules of adjudication (to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (allowing laws to be varied) and the rule of recognition (allowing laws to be identified as valid). Two of Hart's students continued the debate: In his book ''[[Law's Empire]]'', [[Ronald Dworkin]] attacked Hart and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue. Dworkin argues that law is an "[[interpretivism (legal)|interpretive]] concept",&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, ''[[Law's Empire]]'', 410.&lt;/ref&gt; that requires judges to find the best fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. [[Joseph Raz]], on the other hand, defended the positivist outlook and criticised Hart's "soft social thesis" approach in ''The Authority of Law''.&lt;ref name="jra"&gt;Raz, ''The Authority of Law'', 3–36&lt;/ref&gt; Raz argues that law is authority, identifiable purely through social sources and without reference to moral reasoning. In his view, any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authoritative instruments in mediation are best left to [[sociology]], rather than jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;Raz, ''The Authority of Law'', 37 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive law and non-positive law discussions ===
{{main|Positive law}}
One definition is that law is a system of rules and guidelines which are enforced through social institutions to govern behaviour&lt;!-- HIDDEN UNTIL VERIFIED, wherever possible--&gt;.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; In ''[[The Concept of Law]]'' Hart argued law is a "system of rules";&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Contribution of Legal Studies'', 184&lt;/ref&gt; Austin said law was "the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction";&lt;ref name="jap" /&gt; Dworkin describes law as an "interpretive concept" to achieve [[justice]] in his text titled ''[[Law's Empire]]'';&lt;ref name="Dworkin, [[Law's Empire]], 410"&gt;Dworkin, ''[[Law's Empire]]'', 410&lt;/ref&gt; and Raz argues law is an "authority" to mediate people's interests.&lt;ref name="jra" /&gt; Holmes said "The prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law."&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Oliver Wendell. "The Path of Law" (1897) 10 ''Harvard Law Review'' 457 at 461.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Treatise on Law]]'' Aquinas argues that law is a rational ordering of things which concern the common good that is promulgated by whoever is charged with the care of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas, St Thomas.

=== Economic analysis ===
{{Main|Law and economics}}

In the 18th century [[Adam Smith]] presented a philosophical foundation for explaining the relationship between law and economics.&lt;ref&gt;According to Malloy (''Law and Economics'', 114), Smith established "a classical liberal philosophy that made individuals the key referential sign while acknowledging that we live not alone but in community with others".&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline arose partly out of a critique of trade unions and U.S. [[antitrust]] law. The most influential proponents, such as [[Richard Posner]] and [[Oliver E. Williamson|Oliver Williamson]] and the so-called [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]] of economists and lawyers including [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Gary Becker]], are generally advocates of [[deregulation]] and [[privatisation]], and are hostile to state regulation or what they see as restrictions on the operation of [[free market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jakoby, ''Economic Ideas and the Labour Market'', 53&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richard-A-Posner.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Posner]], one of the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]], runs a blog with [[Bank of Sweden Prize]] winning economist [[Gary Becker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uchicagolaw.typepad.com/beckerposner/ |title=The Becker-Posner Blog |accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The most prominent economic analyst of law is 1991 [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Ronald Coase]], whose first major article, ''[[The Nature of the Firm]]'' (1937), argued that the reason for the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is the existence of [[transaction cost]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Nature of the Firm'', 386–405&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homo economicus|Rational individuals]] trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major article, ''[[The Problem of Social Cost]]'' (1960), argued that if we lived in a world without transaction costs, people would [[bargaining|bargain]] with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', 1–44&lt;/ref&gt; Coase used the example of a [[nuisance]] case named ''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'', where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move.&lt;ref name="Sturges" /&gt; Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor had to put up with it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of [[transaction costs]] may prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', IV, 7&lt;/ref&gt; So the law ought to pre-empt what ''would'' happen, and be guided by the most [[efficiency (economics)|efficient]] solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', V, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', VIII, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sociology ===
{{Main|Sociology of law}}

Sociology of law is a diverse field of study that examines the interaction of law with society and overlaps with jurisprudence, philosophy of law, social theory and more specialised subjects such as [[criminology]].&lt;ref name="Jary"&gt;Cotterrell, ''Sociology of Law'', Jary, ''Collins Dictionary of Sociology'', 636&lt;/ref&gt; The institutions of [[social construction]], [[social norms]], dispute processing and [[legal culture]] are key areas for inquiry in this knowledge field. Sociology of law is sometimes seen as a sub-discipline of sociology, but its ties to the academic discipline of law are equally strong, and it is best seen as a transdisciplinary and multidisciplinary study focused on the theorisation and empirical study of legal practices and experiences as social phenomena. In the United States the field is usually called [[law and society]] studies; in Europe it is more often referred to as socio-legal studies. At first, jurists and legal philosophers were suspicious of sociology of law. Kelsen attacked one of its founders, [[Eugen Ehrlich]], who sought to make clear the differences and connections between positive law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law' or social norms that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching barristers and courts.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, ''Fundamental Principles'', Hertogh, ''Living Law'', Rottleuthner, ''La Sociologie du Droit en Allemagne'', 109, Rottleuthner, ''Rechtstheoritische Probleme der Sociologie des Rechts'', 521&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary research in sociology of law is much concerned with the way that law is developing outside discrete state jurisdictions, being produced through social interaction in many different kinds of social arenas, and acquiring a diversity of sources of (often competing or conflicting) authority in communal networks existing sometimes within nation states but increasingly also transnationally.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, ''Law, Culture and Society''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Max Weber 1917.jpg|thumb|left|[[Max Weber]] in 1917, Weber began his career as a lawyer, and is regarded as one of the founders of sociology and sociology of law.]]

Around 1900 [[Max Weber]] defined his "scientific" approach to law, identifying the "legal rational form" as a type of domination, not attributable to personal authority but to the authority of abstract norms.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinstein, ''Max Weber on Law and Economy in Society'', 336&lt;/ref&gt; Formal legal rationality was his term for the key characteristic of the kind of coherent and calculable law that was a precondition for modern political developments and the modern bureaucratic state. Weber saw this law as having developed in parallel with the growth of capitalism.&lt;ref name="Jary" /&gt; Another leading sociologist, [[Émile Durkheim]], wrote in his classic work ''The Division of Labour in Society'' that as society becomes more complex, the body of civil law concerned primarily with restitution and compensation grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, ''Emile Durkheim: Law in a Moral Domain'', Johnson, ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology'', 156&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable early legal sociologists included [[Hugo Sinzheimer]], [[Theodor Geiger]], [[Georges Gurvitch]] and [[Leon Petrażycki]] in Europe, and [[William Graham Sumner]] in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Gurvitch, ''Sociology of Law'', 142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Papachristou, ''Sociology of Law'', 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodological background ==
Law is complex from a methodological viewpoint. Its peculiar features make its unique against the background of other sciences and disciplines.

First, it is not only of a normative but also of a prescriptive nature. Law says how people ought to behave or not, what they may or may not require from others, and what they have to or have not to do if someone ask for that. But normative statements in law are deprived of a descriptive  or causal character as opposed to normative statements in empirical science (as a law of gravity) or even social science (as a law of demand and supply in economics).

Second, there is no possibility of empirical verification of the contents of law.  Whether the law should or should not comprise precepts of such-and-such import remains far beyond empirical proof. It is a matter of choice.

Third, law is dependent on the shape of the physical world and the limitations inherent in it. It cannot mandate behaviours which are unattainable or force people to do things which are beyond their capabilities.

Fourth, law is fully contingent on humans and their minds. Without humans and their mental operations it would be very difficult to speak about the law, its enforcement and application.

Fifth, law agents, such as judges, advocates and officials, are unspecialized in the sense that they lack some complex theories as to good and evil, empirical and social science or justice (proper distribution of goods/privileges and burdens in a society).

Sixth, the role of authority is prominent in law, while at the same time in law there are not means which enable us to check the correctness of authoritative statements (be they comprised in judicial opinions or scholarly literature).

Seventh, the procedure in which law is authoritatively applied is very specific. It is rigorous, precise, complex, casuistic and often very formal. The outcome of such procedure is obligatory in the sense that a judge cannot free himself or herself from passing his/her decision. There are also very limited means for re-opening such procedure when its being once completed.&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski, Why Does Legal Reasoning Have to Be Unique?. The Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law no. 3/2016, pp.  555–575.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal methods ==

There are distinguished methods of legal reasoning (applying the law) and methods of interpreting (construing) the law. The former are [[legal syllogism]], which holds sway in civil law legal systems,  [[analogy]], which is present in common law legal systems, especially in the US, and argumentative theories that occur in both systems. The latter are different rules (directives) of legal interpretation such as directives of linguistic interpretation, teleological interpretation or systemic interpretation as well as more specific rules, for instance, [[golden rule]] or [[mischief rule]]. There are also many other arguments and cannons of interpretation which altogether make [[statutory interpretation]] possible.

Law professor and former [[United States Attorney General]] [[Edward H. Levi]] noted that the "basic pattern of legal reasoning is reasoning by example" - that is, reasoning by comparing outcomes in cases resolving similar legal questions.&lt;ref&gt;Edward H. Levi, ''An Introduction to Legal Reasoning'' (2013), p. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; In a U.S. Supreme Court case regarding procedural efforts taken by a debt collection company to avoid errors, Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor|Sotomayor]] cautioned that "legal reasoning is not a mechanical or strictly linear process"''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerman v. Carlisle]]'', 130 S.Ct. 1605, 1614, 559 U.S. 573, 587 (2010), [[Sonia Sotomayor|Sotomayor]], J.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal systems ==
{{Main|List of national legal systems}}
In general, legal systems can be split between civil law and common law systems.&lt;ref&gt;Modern scholars argue that the significance of this distinction has progressively declined; the numerous [[legal transplants]], typical of modern law, result in the sharing by modern legal systems of many features traditionally considered typical of either common law or civil law (Mattei, ''Comparative Law and Economics'', 71)&lt;/ref&gt; The term "civil law" referring to a legal system should not be confused with "civil law" as a group of legal subjects distinct from criminal or [[public law]]. A third type of legal system—accepted by some countries without [[separation of church and state]]—is religious law, based on [[scripture]]s. The specific system that a country is ruled by is often determined by its history, connections with other countries, or its adherence to international standards. The [[sources of law|sources]] that jurisdictions adopt as authoritatively binding are the defining features of any legal system. Yet classification is a matter of form rather than substance, since similar rules often prevail.

[[File:Code Civil 1804.png|thumb|First page of the 1804 edition of the [[Napoleonic Code]].]]

Civil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world today. In civil law the sources recognised as authoritative are, primarily, legislation—especially [[Codification (law)|codifications]] in constitutions or [[statute]]s passed by government—and [[custom (law)|custom]].&lt;ref&gt;Civil law jurisdictions recognise custom as "the other source of law"; hence, scholars tend to divide the civil law into the broad categories of "written law" (''ius scriptum'') or legislation, and "unwritten law" (''ius non scriptum'') or custom. Yet they tend to dismiss custom as being of slight importance compared to legislation (Georgiadis, ''General Principles of Civil Law'', 19; Washofsky, ''Taking Precedent Seriously'', 7).&lt;/ref&gt; Codifications date back millennia, with one early example being the [[Babylonian law|Babylonian]] ''[[Code of Hammurabi|Codex Hammurabi]]''. Modern civil law systems essentially derive from the legal practice of the 6th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] whose texts were rediscovered by late [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Western Europe. Roman law in the days of the [[Roman Republic]] and Empire was heavily procedural, and lacked a professional legal class.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 18&lt;/ref&gt; Instead a lay [[magistrate]], ''iudex'', was chosen to adjudicate. Decisions were not published in any systematic way, so any case law that developed was disguised and almost unrecognised.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; Each case was to be decided afresh from the laws of the State, which mirrors the (theoretical) unimportance of judges' decisions for future cases in civil law systems today. From 529–534 AD the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Justinian I]] codified and consolidated Roman law up until that point, so that what remained was one-twentieth of the mass of legal texts from before.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 32&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]''. As one legal historian wrote, "Justinian consciously looked back to the golden age of Roman law and aimed to restore it to the peak it had reached three centuries before."&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 35&lt;/ref&gt; The Justinian Code remained in force in the East until the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Western Europe, meanwhile, relied on a mix of the [[Codex Theodosianus|Theodosian Code]] and Germanic customary law until the Justinian Code was rediscovered in the 11th century, and scholars at the [[University of Bologna]] used it to interpret their own laws.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 43&lt;/ref&gt; Civil law codifications based closely on Roman law, alongside some influences from [[religious law]]s such as [[canon law]], continued to spread throughout Europe until the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]; then, in the 19th century, both France, with the ''[[Code Civil]]'', and Germany, with the ''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'', modernised their legal codes. Both these codes influenced heavily not only the law systems of the countries in continental Europe (e.g. Greece), but also the [[Law of Japan|Japanese]] and [[South Korea|Korean]] legal traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hatzis, ''The Short-Lived Influence of the Napoleonic Civil Code in Greece'', 253–263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Demirgüç-Kunt -Levine, ''Financial Structures and Economic Growth'', 204&lt;/ref&gt; Today, countries that have civil law systems range from [[Law of Russia|Russia]] and [[Law of the People's Republic of China|China]] to most of [[Central America|Central]] and [[Law of South America|Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2100.html The World Factbook&amp;nbsp;– Field Listing&amp;nbsp;– Legal system], CIA&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of Louisiana's Civil Code, the United States follows the common law system described below.

=== Common law and equity ===
{{Main|Common law}}
[[File:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna.jpg|thumb|King John of England signs Magna Carta]]

In [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law legal systems]], decisions by courts are explicitly acknowledged as "law" on equal footing with [[statute law|statutes]] adopted through the legislative process and with [[Regulation (law)|regulations]] issued by the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]].  The "doctrine of precedent", or ''[[stare decisis]]'' (Latin for "to stand by decisions") means that decisions by higher courts bind lower courts, and future decisions of the same court, to assure that similar cases reach similar results.  In [[Common law#2. Common law legal systems as opposed to civil law legal systems|contrast]], in "[[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]" systems, legislative statutes are typically more detailed, and judicial decisions are shorter and less detailed, because the judge or barrister is only writing to decide the single case, rather than to set out reasoning that will guide future courts.

Common law originated from England and has been inherited by almost every country once tied to the [[British Empire]] (except Malta, [[Law of Scotland|Scotland]], the U.S. state of [[Louisiana law|Louisiana]], and the Canadian province of [[Quebec law|Quebec]]). In medieval England, the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] the law varied-shire-to-shire, based on disparate tribal customs. The concept of a "common law" developed during the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] during the late 12th century, when Henry appointed judges that had authority to create an institutionalized and unified system of law "common" to the country. The next major step in the evolution of the common law came when [[John of England|King John]] was forced by his barons to sign a document limiting his authority to pass laws. This "great charter" or ''[[Magna Carta]]'' of 1215 also required that the King's entourage of judges hold their courts and judgments at "a certain place" rather than dispensing autocratic justice in unpredictable places about the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html Magna Carta], Fordham University&lt;/ref&gt; A concentrated and elite group of judges acquired a dominant role in law-making under this system, and compared to its European counterparts the English judiciary became highly centralized. In 1297, for instance, while the highest court in France had fifty-one judges, the [[English Court of Common Pleas]] had five.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; This powerful and tight-knit judiciary gave rise to a systematized process of developing common law.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 3&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the system became overly systematized—overly rigid and inflexible.  As a result, as time went on, increasing numbers of citizens petitioned the King to override the common law, and on the King's behalf the [[Lord Chancellor]] gave judgment to do what was equitable in a case. From the time of [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]], the first [[lawyer]] to be appointed as Lord Chancellor, a systematic body of equity grew up alongside the rigid common law, and developed its own [[Court of Chancery]]. At first, equity was often criticized as erratic, that it varied according to the length of the Chancellor's foot.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock (ed) ''Table Talk of [[John Selden]]'' (1927) 43; "Equity is a roguish thing. For law we have a measure... equity is according to the conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that is longer or narrower, so is equity. 'Tis all one as if they should make the standard for the measure a Chancellor's foot."&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, courts of equity developed solid [[Maxims of equity|principles]], especially under [[John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon|Lord Eldon]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gee v Pritchard]]'' (1818) 2 Swans. 402, 414&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century in England, and in [[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish|1937 in the U.S.]], the two systems were [[Common law#1870 through 20th century, and the procedural merger of law and equity|merged]].

In developing the common law, [[Common law#Contrasting role of treatises and academic writings in common law and civil law systems|academic writings]] have always played an important part, both to collect overarching principles from dispersed case law, and to argue for change. [[William Blackstone]], from around 1760, was the first scholar to collect, describe, and teach the common law.&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp Book the First&amp;nbsp;– Chapter the First]&lt;/ref&gt; But merely in describing, scholars who sought explanations and underlying structures slowly changed the way the law actually worked.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious law ===
{{Main|Religious law}}
Religious law is explicitly based on religious precepts. Examples include the Jewish [[Halakha]] and Islamic [[Sharia]]—both of which translate as the "path to follow"—while Christian [[canon law]] also survives in some church communities. Often the implication of religion for law is unalterability, because the word of God cannot be amended or legislated against by judges or governments.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} However a thorough and detailed legal system generally requires human elaboration. For instance, the [[Quran]] has some law, and it acts as a source of further law through interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 159&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Qiyas]]'' (reasoning by analogy), ''[[Ijma]]'' (consensus) and [[precedent]]. This is mainly contained in a body of law and jurisprudence known as [[Sharia]] and [[Fiqh]] respectively. Another example is the [[Torah]] or [[Old Testament]], in the [[Pentateuch]] or Five Books of Moses. This contains the basic code of Jewish law, which some Israeli communities choose to use. The [[Halakha]] is a code of Jewish law which summarises some of the Talmud's interpretations. Nevertheless, [[Israeli law]] allows [[litigant]]s to use religious laws only if they choose. [[Canon law]] is only in use by members of the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]].

[[File:1879-Ottoman Court-from-NYL.png|thumb|left|A trial in the Ottoman Empire, 1879, when religious law applied under the [[Mecelle]]]]

==== Sharia law ====
{{Main|Sharia}}
Until the 18th century, Sharia law was practiced throughout the [[Muslim world]] in a non-codified form, with the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Mecelle]] code in the 19th century being a first attempt at [[Codification (law)|codifying]] elements of Sharia law. Since the mid-1940s, efforts have been made, in country after country, to bring Sharia law more into line with modern conditions and conceptions.&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;Anderson, ''Law Reform in the Middle East'', 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giannoulatos, ''Islam'', 274–275&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, the legal systems of many Muslim countries draw upon both civil and common law traditions as well as Islamic law and custom. The constitutions of certain Muslim states, such as Egypt and Afghanistan, recognise Islam as the religion of the state, obliging legislature to adhere to Sharia.&lt;ref&gt;Sherif, ''Constitutions of Arab Countries'', 157–158&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia recognises Quran as its constitution, and is governed on the basis of Islamic law.&lt;ref name=Jurist&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/saudiarabia.htm Saudi Arabia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830232216/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/saudiarabia.htm |date=30 August 2006 }}, Jurist&lt;/ref&gt; Iran has also witnessed a reiteration of Islamic law into its legal system after 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Akhlagi, ''Iranian Commercial Law'', 127&lt;/ref&gt; During the last few decades, one of the fundamental features of the movement of [[Islamic resurgence]] has been the call to restore the Sharia, which has generated a vast amount of literature and affected [[Global politics|world politics]].&lt;ref name="H1"&gt;Hallaq, ''The Origins and Evolution of Islamic Law'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal institutions ==
{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=left|quote=It is a real unity of them all in one and the same person, made by covenant of every man with every man, in such manner as if every man should say to every man: I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou givest up, thy right to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner.|source=Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', [http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXVII XVII]}}

The main institutions of law in industrialised countries are independent [[courts]], representative parliaments, an accountable executive, the military and police, [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] organisation, the [[legal profession]] and [[civil society]] itself. John Locke, in his ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'', and [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]] in ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', advocated for a [[separation of powers]] between the political, legislature and executive bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Montesquieu]], ''The Spirit of Laws'', [http://www.constitution.org/cm/sol_11.htm#006 Book XI: Of the Laws Which Establish Political Liberty, with Regard to the Constitution, Chapters 6–7]&lt;/ref&gt; Their principle was that no person should be able to usurp all powers of the [[State (polity)|state]], in contrast to the [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] theory of [[Thomas Hobbes]]' ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.&lt;ref name="H17"&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20021125191001/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXVII XVII]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]] and others reshaped thinking on the extension of state. Modern military, policing and bureaucratic power over ordinary citizens' daily lives pose special problems for accountability that earlier writers such as Locke or Montesquieu could not have foreseen. The custom and practice of the legal profession is an important part of people's access to [[justice]], whilst civil society is a term used to refer to the social institutions, communities and partnerships that form law's political basis.

=== Judiciary ===
{{Main|Judiciary}}
A judiciary is a number of judges mediating disputes to determine outcome. Most countries have systems of appeal courts, answering up to a supreme legal authority. In the United States, this authority is the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.pdf A Brief Overview of the Supreme Court], Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia, the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]]; in the UK, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.pdf House of Lords Judgments], House of Lords&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany, the ''[[Bundesverfassungsgericht]]''; and in France, the ''[[Cour de cassation (France)|Cour de Cassation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen.html Entscheidungen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121164330/http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen.html |date=21 November 2006 }}, Bundesverfassungsgericht&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courdecassation.fr/jurisprudence_publications_documentation_2/ Jurisprudence, publications, documentation], Cour de cassation&lt;/ref&gt; For most European countries the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg can overrule national law, when EU law is relevant. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg allows citizens of the [[Council of Europe]] member states to bring cases relating to human rights issues before it.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, ''European Court of Human Rights'', 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Public hearing at the ICJ.jpg|thumb|left|The judges of the [[International Court of Justice]] in [[the Hague]]]]
Some countries allow their highest judicial authority to overrule legislation they determine to be [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. For example, in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the United States Supreme Court nullified many state statutes that had established [[Racial segregation in the United States|racially segregated]] schools, finding such statutes to be incompatible with the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, ''Brown v. Board of Education''&lt;/ref&gt;

A judiciary is theoretically bound by the constitution, just as all other government bodies are. In most countries judges may only [[interpretivism (legal)|interpret]] the constitution and all other laws. But in common law countries, where matters are not constitutional, the judiciary may also create law under the [[doctrine of precedent]]. The UK, Finland and New Zealand assert the ideal of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], whereby the unelected judiciary may not overturn law passed by a democratic legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Dicey, ''Law of the Constitution'', 37–82&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[communist state]]s, such as China, the courts are often regarded as parts of the executive, or subservient to the legislature; governmental institutions and actors exert thus various forms of influence on the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., the court president is a political appointee (Jensen–Heller, ''Introduction'', 11–12). About the notion of "judicial independence" in China, see Findlay, ''Judiciary in the PRC'', 282–284&lt;/ref&gt; In Muslim countries, courts often examine whether state laws adhere to the Sharia: the [[Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt]] may invalidate such laws,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sherif, ''Constitutions of Arab Countries'', 158&lt;/ref&gt; and in Iran the [[Guardian Council]] ensures the compatibility of the legislation with the "criteria of Islam".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rasekh, ''Islamism and Republicanism'', 115–116&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislature ===
{{Main|Legislature}}
[[File:European-parliament-brussels-inside.JPG|thumb|The debating chamber of the [[European Parliament]]]]
Prominent examples of legislatures are the [[Houses of Parliament]] in London, the [[United States Congress|Congress]] in Washington D.C., the [[Bundestag]] in Berlin, the [[Duma]] in Moscow, the [[Parliament of Italy|Parlamento Italiano]] in Rome and the [[National Assembly of France|''Assemblée nationale'']] in Paris. By the principle of representative government people vote for politicians to carry out ''their'' wishes. Although countries like Israel, Greece, Sweden and China are [[unicameralism|unicameral]], most countries are [[bicameralism|bicameral]], meaning they have two separately appointed legislative houses.&lt;ref name="Riker101"&gt;Riker, ''The Justification of Bicameralism'', 101&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 'lower house' politicians are elected to represent smaller [[constituency|constituencies]]. The 'upper house' is usually elected to represent states in a [[Federal republic|federal]] system (as in Australia, Germany or the United States) or different voting configuration in a unitary system (as in France). In the UK the upper house is appointed by the government as a [[House of Lords|house of review]]. One criticism of bicameral systems with two elected chambers is that the upper and lower houses may simply mirror one another. The traditional justification of bicameralism is that an upper chamber acts as a house of review. This can minimise arbitrariness and injustice in governmental action.&lt;ref name="Riker101" /&gt;

To pass legislation, a majority of the members of a legislature must [[vote]] for a [[bill (proposed law)]] in each house. Normally there will be several readings and amendments proposed by the different political factions. If a country has an entrenched constitution, a special majority for changes to the constitution may be required, making changes to the law more difficult. A government usually leads the process, which can be formed from Members of Parliament (e.g. the UK or Germany). However, in a presidential system, the government is usually formed by an executive and his or her appointed cabinet officials (e.g. the United States or Brazil).&lt;ref&gt;About "cabinet accountability" in both presidential and parliamentary systems, see Shugart–Haggard, ''Presidential Systems'', 67 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Executive ===
{{Main|Executive (government)}}
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev 2 April 2009-1.jpg|left|thumb|The [[G-20 major economies|G20]] meetings are composed of representatives of each country's executive branch.]]
The executive in a legal system serves as the centre of political [[authority]] of the [[State (polity)|State]]. In a [[parliamentary system]], as with Britain, Italy, Germany, India, and Japan, the executive is known as the cabinet, and composed of members of the legislature. The executive is led by the [[head of government]], whose office holds power under the [[Motion of no confidence|confidence]] of the legislature. Because popular elections appoint political parties to govern, the leader of a party can change in between elections.&lt;ref name="Haggard71"&gt;Haggard, ''Presidents, Parliaments and Policy'', 71&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[head of state]] is apart from the executive, and symbolically enacts laws and acts as representative of the nation. Examples include the [[President of Germany]] (appointed by [[Federal Convention (Germany)|members of federal and state legislatures]]), the [[Queen of the United Kingdom]] (an [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary office]]), and the [[President of Austria]] (elected by popular vote). The other important model is the [[presidential system]], found in the [[President of the United States|United States]] and in [[President of Brazil|Brazil]]. In presidential systems, the executive acts as both head of state and head of government, and has power to appoint an unelected cabinet. Under a presidential system, the executive branch is separate from the legislature to which it is not accountable.&lt;ref name="Haggard71" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, ''The New Parliaments of Central and Eastern Europe'', 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the role of the executive varies from country to country, usually it will propose the majority of legislation, and propose government agenda. In presidential systems, the executive often has the power to veto legislation. Most executives in both systems are responsible for [[Foreign policy|foreign relations]], the military and police, and the bureaucracy. [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] or other officials head a country's public offices, such as a [[Foreign minister|foreign ministry]] or [[Defence minister|defence ministry]]. The election of a different executive is therefore capable of revolutionising an entire country's approach to government.

=== Military and police ===
{{Main|Military|Police}}
[[File:US Customs and Border Protection officers.jpg|thumb|[[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] officers]]

While military organisations have existed as long as government itself, the idea of a standing police force is a relatively modern concept. For example, [[Medieval England]]'s system of traveling [[criminal court]]s, or [[Assize Court|assizes]], used [[show trial]]s and public executions to instill communities with fear to maintain control.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. ''Tuberville v Savage'' (1669), 1 Mod. Rep. 3, 86 Eng. Rep. 684, where a knight said in a threatening tone to a layman, "If it were not assize time, I would not take such language from you."&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern police were probably those in 17th-century Paris, in the court of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=219522 History of Police Forces] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229014447/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=219522 |date=29 December 2006 }}, History.com Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; although the Paris Prefecture of Police claim they were the world's first uniformed policemen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080506215949/http://www.prefecture-police-paris.interieur.gouv.fr/documentation/bicentenaire/theme_expo4.htm Des Sergents de Ville et Gardiens de la Paix à la Police de Proximité], La Préfecture de Police&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]] famously argued that the state is that which controls the [[monopoly on the legitimate use of force]].&lt;ref name="mwp154"&gt;Weber, [[s:Politics as a Vocation|Politics as a Vocation]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weber, ''The Theory of Social and Economic Organisation'', 154&lt;/ref&gt; The military and police carry out enforcement at the request of the government or the courts. The term [[failed state]] refers to states that cannot implement or enforce policies; their police and military no longer control security and order and society moves into anarchy, the absence of government.&lt;ref&gt;In these cases sovereignty is eroded, and often warlords acquire excessive powers (Fukuyama, ''State-Building'', 166–167).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bureaucracy ===
{{Main|Bureaucracy}}
[[File:UN Headquarters 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The United Nations' New York [[United Nations Headquarters|headquarters]] houses civil servants that serve its 193 member states.]]

The etymology of "bureaucracy" derives from the French word for "office" (''bureau'') and the [[Ancient Greek]] for word "power" (''kratos'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=bureaucracy&amp;searchmode Bureaucracy], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Like the military and police, a legal system's government servants and bodies that make up its bureaucracy carry out the directives of the executive. One of the earliest references to the concept was made by [[Friedrich Melchior, baron von Grimm|Baron de Grimm]], a German author who lived in France. In 1765 he wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The real spirit of the laws in France is that bureaucracy of which the late Monsieur de Gournay used to complain so greatly; here the offices, clerks, secretaries, inspectors and ''intendants'' are not appointed to benefit the public interest, indeed the public interest appears to have been established so that offices might exist.&lt;ref&gt;Albrow, ''Bureaucracy'', 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cynicism over "officialdom" is still common, and the workings of public servants is typically contrasted to [[private enterprise]] motivated by [[Maximization (economics)|profit]].&lt;ref&gt;Mises, ''Bureaucracy'', II, [https://www.mises.org/etexts/mises/bureaucracy/section2.asp Bureaucratic Management]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact private companies, especially large ones, also have bureaucracies.&lt;ref name="K367"&gt;Kettl, ''Public Bureaucracies'', 367&lt;/ref&gt; Negative perceptions of "[[red tape]]" aside, public services such as schooling, health care, policing or public transport are considered a crucial state function making public bureaucratic action the locus of government power.&lt;ref name="K367" /&gt;

Writing in the early 20th century, Max Weber believed that a definitive feature of a developed state had come to be its bureaucratic support.&lt;ref name="mwp393"&gt;Weber, ''Economy and Society'', I, 393&lt;/ref&gt; Weber wrote that the typical characteristics of modern bureaucracy are that officials define its mission, the scope of work is bound by rules, and management is composed of career experts who manage top down, communicating through writing and binding public servants' discretion with rules.&lt;ref&gt;Kettl, ''Public Bureaucracies'', 371&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal profession ===
{{Main|Legal profession}}
[[File:Quentin Massys 007.jpg|thumb|In civil law systems such as those of Italy, France, Germany, Spain and Greece, there is a distinct category of [[Civil law notary|notary]], a legally trained public official, compensated by the parties to a transaction.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 22&lt;/ref&gt; This is a 16th-century painting of such a notary by Flemish painter [[Quentin Massys]].]]

A corollary of the rule of law is the existence of a legal profession sufficiently autonomous to invoke the authority of the independent judiciary; the right to assistance of a [[barrister]] in a court proceeding emanates from this corollary—in England the function of barrister or advocate is distinguished from legal counselor.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; As the European Court of Human Rights has stated, the law should be adequately accessible to everyone and people should be able to foresee how the law affects them.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Sunday Times v The United Kingdom]]'' [1979] [http://www.worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1979/1.html ECHR 1 at 49] Case no. 6538/74&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to maintain professionalism, the [[practice of law]] is typically overseen by either a government or independent regulating body such as a [[bar association]], [[bar council]] or [[law society]]. Modern lawyers achieve distinct professional identity through specified legal procedures (e.g. successfully passing a qualifying examination), are required by law to have a special qualification (a legal education earning the student a [[Bachelor of Laws]], a [[Bachelor of Civil Law]], or a [[Juris Doctor]] degree. Higher academic degrees may also be pursued. Examples include a [[Master of Laws]], a [[Master of Legal Studies]], a [[Bar Professional Training Course]] or a [[Doctor of Laws]].), and are constituted in office by legal forms of appointment ([[admission to the bar|being admitted to the bar]]). There are few titles of respect to signify famous lawyers, such as [[Esquire]], to indicate barristers of greater dignity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British English: Esquire|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/esquire?showCookiePolicy=true|accessdate=23 September 2014|date=n.d.|publisher=Collins Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/esquire?showCookiePolicy=true|publisher=Collins Dictionary|title=American English: Esquire|accessdate=23 September 2014|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Doctor of law]], to indicate a person who obtained a [[PhD]] in Law.

Many Muslim countries have developed similar rules about legal education and the legal profession, but some still allow lawyers with training in traditional Islamic law to practice law before personal status law courts.&lt;ref&gt;Ahamd, [http://www.macalester.edu/~ahmad/Lawyers.pdf Lawyers: Islamic Law] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001195205/http://www.macalester.edu/~ahmad/Lawyers.pdf |date=1 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In China and other developing countries there are not sufficient professionally trained people to staff the existing judicial systems, and, accordingly, formal standards are more relaxed.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Once accredited, a lawyer will often work in a [[law firm]], in a [[chambers (law)|chambers]] as a sole practitioner, in a government post or in a private corporation as an internal [[counsel]]. In addition a lawyer may become a [[legal research]]er who provides on-demand legal research through a library, a commercial service or freelance work. Many people trained in law put their skills to use outside the legal field entirely.&lt;ref name="Fine364"&gt;Fine, ''The Globalisation of Legal Education'', 364&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant to the practice of law in the common law tradition is the legal research to determine the current state of the law. This usually entails exploring [[law report|case-law reports]], [[legal periodical]]s and legislation. Law practice also involves drafting documents such as court [[pleading]]s, persuasive [[brief (law)|briefs]], contracts, or [[will (law)|wills]] and trusts. Negotiation and [[dispute resolution]] skills (including [[Alternative dispute resolution|ADR]] techniques) are also important to legal practice, depending on the field.&lt;ref name="Fine364" /&gt;

=== Civil society ===
{{Main|Civil society}}
[[File:1963 march on washington.jpg|thumb|left|A march in Washington D.C. during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in 1963]]

The [[classical republicanism|Classical republican]] concept of "civil society" dates back to Hobbes and Locke.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, ''Civil Society'', 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Locke saw civil society as people who have "a common established law and judicature to appeal to, with authority to decide controversies between them."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''[[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government|Second Treatise]]'', Chap. VII, Of Political or Civil_Society. Chapter 7, section 87&lt;/ref&gt; German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] distinguished the "state" from "civil society" (''bürgerliche Gesellschaft'') in ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, ''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', 3, II, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prcivils.htm 182]; Karkatsoulis, ''The State in Transition'', 277–278&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel believed that [[civil society]] and the [[State (polity)|state]] were polar opposites, within the scheme of his dialectic theory of history. The modern dipole state–civil society was reproduced in the theories of [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] and [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref&gt;(Pelczynski, ''The State and Civil Society'', 1–13; Warren, ''Civil Society'', 5–9)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays in post-modern theory civil society is necessarily a source of law, by being the basis from which people form opinions and lobby for what they believe law should be. As Australian barrister and author [[Geoffrey Robertson QC]] wrote of international law,

&lt;blockquote&gt;... one of its primary modern sources is found in the responses of ordinary men and women, and of the non-governmental organizations which many of them support, to the human rights abuses they see on the television screen in their living rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''Crimes Against Humanity'', 98–99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Freedom of speech]], [[freedom of association]] and many other individual rights allow people to gather, discuss, criticise and hold to account their governments, from which the basis of a [[deliberative democracy]] is formed. The more people are involved with, concerned by and capable of changing how political power is exercised over their lives, the more acceptable and [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] the law becomes to the people. The most familiar institutions of civil society include economic markets, profit-oriented firms, families, trade unions, hospitals, universities, schools, charities, [[cogers|debating clubs]], non-governmental organisations, neighbourhoods, churches, and religious associations.&lt;ref&gt;There is no clear legal definition of the civil society, and of the institutions it includes. Most of the institutions and bodies who try to give a list of institutions (such as the [[European Economic and Social Committee]]) exclude the political parties. For further information, see Jakobs, ''Pursuing Equal Opportunities'', 5–6; Kaldor–Anheier–Glasius, ''Global Civil Society'', ''[http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/Publications/Yearbooks/2003/2003Chapter1a.pdf passim]'' (PDF); Karkatsoulis, ''The State in Transition'', 282–283. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817130457/http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/Publications/Yearbooks/2003/2003Chapter1a.pdf |date=17 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal subjects ==
All legal systems deal with the same basic issues, but jurisdictions categorise and identify its legal subjects in different ways. A common distinction is that between "[[public law]]" (a term related closely to the [[State (law)|state]], and including constitutional, administrative and criminal law), and "[[private law]]" (which covers contract, [[tort]] and property).&lt;ref&gt;Although many scholars argue that "the boundaries between public and private law are becoming blurred", and that this distinction has become mere "folklore" (Bergkamp, ''Liability and Environment'', 1–2).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[civil law(legal system)|civil law]] systems, contract and tort fall under a general [[law of obligations]], while trusts law is dealt with under statutory regimes or [[Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition|international conventions]]. International, constitutional and administrative law, criminal law, contract, tort, property law and [[trust law|trusts]] are regarded as the "traditional core subjects",&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in England these seven subjects, with EU law substituted for international law, make up a "qualifying law degree". For criticism, see [[Peter Birks]]' poignant comments attached to a previous version of the [http://webjcli.ncl.ac.uk/articles1/birks1.html#appendix Notice to Law Schools].&lt;/ref&gt; although there are many [[Law#Further disciplines|further disciplines]].

[[File:Alberico Gentili.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The Italian lawyer [[Alberico Gentili|Sir Alberico Gentili]], the Father of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pagden|first=Anthony|title=Vitoria: Political Writings (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought)|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=UK|isbn=978-0-521-36714-1|page=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[International law]] can refer to three things: public international law, private international law or conflict of laws and the law of supranational organisations.
* '''[[Public international law]]''' concerns relationships between sovereign nations. The [[Sources of international law|sources]] for public international law development are [[Custom (law)|custom]], practice and treaties between sovereign nations, such as the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Public international law can be formed by [[international organisations]], such as the United Nations (which was established after the failure of the [[League of Nations]] to prevent World War II),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm History of the UN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218221016/http://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm |date=18 February 2010 }}, United Nations. [[Winston Churchill]] (''The Hinge of Fate'', 719) comments on the League of Nations' failure: "It was wrong to say that the League failed. It was rather the member states who had failed the League."&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Labour Organization|International Labour Organisation]], the [[World Trade Organization]], or the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Public international law has a special status as law because there is no international police force, and courts (e.g. the [[International Court of Justice]] as the primary UN judicial organ) lack the capacity to penalise disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;The prevailing manner of enforcing international law is still essentially "self help"; that is the reaction by states to alleged breaches of international obligations by other states (Robertson, ''Crimes against Humanity'', 90; Schermers-Blokker, ''International Institutional Law'', 900–901).&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few bodies, such as the WTO, have effective systems of binding arbitration and dispute resolution backed up by trade sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Petersmann, ''The GATT/WTO Dispute Settlement System'' [http://www.law2lawyer.com/2011/07/21/international-criminal-court/ International Criminal Court] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723080755/http://www.law2lawyer.com/2011/07/21/international-criminal-court/ |date=23 July 2011 }}, 32&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Conflict of laws]]''' (or "private international law" in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries) concerns which [[jurisdiction]] a legal dispute between private parties should be heard in and which jurisdiction's law should be applied. Today, businesses are increasingly capable of shifting [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[labour (economics)|labour]] supply chains across borders, as well as trading with overseas businesses, making the question of which country has jurisdiction even more pressing. Increasing numbers of businesses opt for commercial arbitration under the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention 1958]].&lt;ref&gt;Redfem, ''International Commercial Arbitration'', 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[European Union law]]''' is the first and, so far, only example of an [[supranational law|internationally accepted legal system]] other than the [[United Nations|UN]] and the [[World Trade Organization]]. Given the trend of increasing global economic integration, many regional agreements—especially the [[Union of South American Nations]]—are on track to follow the same model. In the EU, sovereign nations have gathered their authority in a system of courts and [[European Parliament|political institutions]]. These institutions are allowed the ability to enforce legal norms both against or for member states and citizens in a manner which is not possible through public international law.&lt;ref&gt;Schermers–Blokker, ''International Institutional Law'', 943&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[European Court of Justice]] said in the 1960s, European Union law constitutes "a new legal order of international law" for the mutual social and economic benefit of the member states.&lt;ref&gt;See the fundamental [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61962J0026:EN:HTML C-26/62 ''Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen''], and [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61964J0006:EN:HTML ''Flaminio Costa v E.N.E.L.''] decisions of the European Court.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constitutional and administrative law ===
{{Main|Constitutional law|Administrative law}}
[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|The French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]]]
Constitutional and administrative law govern the affairs of the state. [[Constitutional law]] concerns both the relationships between the executive, legislature and judiciary and the human rights or [[civil liberties]] of individuals against the state. Most jurisdictions, like the [[Law of the United States|United States]] and [[Law of France|France]], have a single codified constitution with a [[bill of rights]]. A few, like the [[Law of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], have no such document. A "constitution" is simply those laws which constitute the [[body politic]], from [[statute]], [[case law]] and [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]]. A case named ''[[Entick v Carrington]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Entick v Carrington]]'' (1765) 19 Howell's State Trials 1030; [1765] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1765/J98.html 95 ER 807]&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates a constitutional principle deriving from the common law. Mr Entick's house was searched and ransacked by Sheriff Carrington. When Mr Entick complained in court, Sheriff Carrington argued that a warrant from a Government minister, the [[George Montague-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax|Earl of Halifax]], was valid authority. However, there was no written statutory provision or court authority. The leading judge, [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Lord Camden]], stated that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The great end, for which men entered into society, was to secure their property. That right is preserved sacred and incommunicable in all instances, where it has not been taken away or abridged by some public law for the good of the whole ... If no excuse can be found or produced, the silence of the books is an authority against the defendant, and the plaintiff must have judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.constitution.org/trials/entick/entick_v_carrington.htm | title=Entick v Carrington | work=19 Howell’s State Trials 1029 (1765) | publisher=Constitution Society | location=US | accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fundamental constitutional principle, inspired by [[Two Treatises of Government|John Locke]], holds that [[Everything which is not forbidden is allowed|the individual can do anything except that which is forbidden by law]], and the state may do nothing except that which is authorised by law.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''The Second Treatise'', [[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government#2:9|Chapter 9, section 124]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha, ''On the Rule of Law'', 47&lt;/ref&gt; Administrative law is the chief method for people to hold state bodies to account. People can sue an agency, local council, public service, or government ministry  for [[judicial review]] of actions or decisions, to ensure that they comply with the law, and that the government entity observed required procedure. The first specialist administrative court was the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'' set up in 1799, as [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] assumed power in France.&lt;ref name="A75"&gt;Auby, ''Administrative Law in France'', 75&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criminal law ===
{{Main|Criminal law}}
Criminal law, also known as penal law, pertains to crimes and punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria|Cesare Beccaria]]'s seminal treatise of 1763–1764 is titled ''On Crimes and Punishments'' (''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; It thus regulates the definition of and penalties for offences found to have a sufficiently deleterious social impact but, in itself, makes no moral judgment on an offender nor imposes restrictions on society that physically prevent people from committing a crime in the first place.&lt;ref name="W2"&gt;Brody, Acker and Logan, ''Criminal Law'', 2; Wilson, ''Criminal Law'', 2&lt;/ref&gt; Investigating, apprehending, charging, and trying suspected offenders is regulated by the law of [[criminal procedure]].&lt;ref name="Br2"&gt;Dennis J. Baker, Glanville Williams ''Textbook of Criminal Law'' (London: 2012), 2&lt;/ref&gt; The [[paradigm]] case of a crime lies in the proof, [[Legal burden of proof|beyond reasonable doubt]], that a person is guilty of two things. First, the accused must commit an act which is deemed by society to be criminal, or ''[[actus reus]]'' (guilty act).&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Brody, Acker and Logan, ''Criminal Law'', 205 about ''[[Robinson v. California]]'', 370 U.S. 660 (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the accused must have the requisite [[intention (criminal law)|malicious intent]] to do a criminal act, or ''[[mens rea]]'' (guilty mind). However, for so called "[[Strict liability (criminal)|strict liability]]" crimes, an ''actus reus'' is enough.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Feinman, ''Law 111'', 260–261 about ''[[Powell v. Texas]]'', 392 U.S. 514 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal systems of the civil law tradition distinguish between intention in the broad sense (''dolus directus'' and ''dolus eventualis''), and negligence. Negligence does not carry criminal responsibility unless a particular crime provides for its punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Dörmann, Doswald-Beck and Kolb, ''Elements of War Crimes'', 491&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, ''Leistungsstörungen'', 333&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SalemWitchcraftTrial large.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of a 17th-century criminal trial, for [[witchcraft]] in [[Salem witch trials|Salem]]]]
Examples of crimes include murder, assault, fraud and theft. In exceptional circumstances defences can apply to specific acts, such as killing in [[self-defense (theory)|self defence]], or pleading [[insanity defense|insanity]]. Another example is in the 19th-century English case of ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'', which tested a defence of "[[necessity (criminal law)|necessity]]". The ''Mignonette'', sailing from [[Southampton]] to Sydney, sank. Three crew members and Richard Parker, a 17-year-old cabin boy, were stranded on a raft. They were starving and the cabin boy was close to death. Driven to extreme hunger, the crew killed and ate the cabin boy. The crew survived and were rescued, but put on trial for murder. They argued it was necessary to kill the cabin boy to preserve their own lives. [[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|Lord Coleridge]], expressing immense disapproval, ruled, "to preserve one's life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it." The men were sentenced to [[hanging|hang]], but public opinion was overwhelmingly supportive of the crew's right to preserve their own lives. In the end, the [[Royal prerogative|Crown]] commuted their sentences to six months in jail.&lt;ref&gt;About ''R v Dudley and Stephens'' [1884] [http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_bqb14040.html 14 QBD 273 DC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050228224504/http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_bqb14040.html |date=28 February 2005 }}, see Simpson, ''Cannibalism and the Common Law'', 212–217, 229–237&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal law offences are viewed as offences against not just individual victims, but the community as well.&lt;ref name="W2" /&gt; The state, usually with the help of police, takes the lead in prosecution, which is why in common law countries cases are cited as "''The People'' v ..." or "''R'' (for [[Monarchy|Rex]] or [[Queen regnant|Regina]]) v ...". Also, lay [[jury|juries]] are often used to determine the guilt of defendants on points of fact: juries cannot change legal rules. Some developed countries still condone capital punishment for criminal activity, but the normal punishment for a crime will be [[prison|imprisonment]], [[fine (penalty)|fines]], state supervision (such as probation), or [[community service]]. Modern criminal law has been affected considerably by the social sciences, especially with respect to [[sentence (law)|sentencing]], legal research, legislation, and [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Pelser, ''Criminal Legislation'', 198&lt;/ref&gt; On the international field, 111 countries are [[States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|members]] of the [[International Criminal Court]], which was established to try people for [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ASP/states+parties/ The States Parties to the Rome Statute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623085130/http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ASP/states+parties/ |date=23 June 2011 }}, International Criminal Court&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contract law ===
{{Main|Contract}}
[[File:carbolic smoke ball co.jpg|thumb|The famous Carbolic Smoke Ball advertisement to cure [[influenza]] was held to be a [[unilateral contract]]]]

Contract law concerns enforceable promises, and can be summed up in the Latin phrase ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]'' (agreements must be kept).&lt;ref&gt;Wehberg, ''Pacta Sunt Servanda'', 775&lt;/ref&gt; In common law jurisdictions, three key elements to the creation of a contract are necessary: [[offer and acceptance]], [[consideration]] and the intention to create legal relations. In ''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]]'' a medical firm advertised that its new wonder drug, the smokeball, would cure people's flu, and if it did not, the buyers would get [[pound sterling|£]]100. Many people sued for their £100 when the drug did not work. Fearing bankruptcy, Carbolic argued the advert was not to be taken as a serious, legally binding offer. It was an [[invitation to treat]], mere puffery, a gimmick. But the Court of Appeal held that to a [[reasonable man]] Carbolic had made a serious offer, accentuated by their reassuring statement, "£1000 is deposited". Equally, people had given good consideration for the offer by going to the "distinct inconvenience" of using a faulty product. "Read the advertisement how you will, and twist it about as you will", said [[Nathaniel Lindley, Baron Lindley|Lord Justice Lindley]], "here is a distinct promise expressed in language which is perfectly unmistakable".&lt;ref name="CCSBCE"&gt;About ''[http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_r9321042.html Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041205104916/http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_r9321042.html |date=5 December 2004 }}'' [[Case citation|[1893] 1 QB 256]], and the element of consideration, see Beale and Tallon, ''Contract Law'', 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;

"Consideration" indicates the fact that all parties to a contract have exchanged something of value. Some common law systems, including Australia, are moving away from the idea of consideration as a requirement. The idea of [[estoppel]] or ''culpa in contrahendo'', can be used to create obligations during pre-contractual negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Austotel v Franklins]]'' (1989) 16 NSWLR 582&lt;/ref&gt; In civil law jurisdictions, consideration is not required for a contract to be binding.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in Germany, [http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/311.html §&amp;nbsp;311 Abs. II] [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]]&lt;/ref&gt; In France, an ordinary contract is said to form simply on the basis of a "meeting of the minds" or a "concurrence of wills". [[Law of Germany|Germany]] has a special approach to contracts, which ties into property law. Their '[[abstraction principle (law)|abstraction principle]]' (''Abstraktionsprinzip'') means that the personal obligation of contract forms separately from the title of property being conferred. When contracts are invalidated for some reason (e.g. a car buyer is so drunk that he lacks legal capacity to contract)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/105.html|title=§&amp;nbsp;105 BGB Nichtigkeit der Willenserklärung|work=dejure.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the contractual obligation to pay can be invalidated separately from the proprietary title of the car. [[Unjust enrichment]] law, rather than contract law, is then used to restore title to the rightful owner.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''The Structure of Unjust Enrichment Law'', 1037&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tort law ===
{{Main|Tort}}
[[File:Anti-McDonalds protest Leicester Square London 20041016.jpg|thumb|The "[[McLibel case]]" two were involved in the longest-running case in UK history for publishing a pamphlet criticising [[McDonald's]] restaurants.]]

Torts, sometimes called [[delict]]s, are civil wrongs. To have acted tortiously, one must have breached a duty to another person, or infringed some pre-existing legal right. A simple example might be accidentally hitting someone with a cricket ball.&lt;ref&gt;''Bolton v Stone'' [1951] AC 850&lt;/ref&gt; Under the law of [[negligence]], the most common form of tort, the injured party could potentially claim compensation for their injuries from the party responsible. The principles of negligence are illustrated by ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]''.&lt;ref name="DvS"&gt;''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' ([[Case citation#England and Wales|[1932] A.C. 532, 1932 S.C. (H.L.) 31, [1932] All ER Rep 1]]). See the original text of the case in [http://www.leeds.ac.uk/law/hamlyn/donoghue.htm UK Law Online].&lt;/ref&gt; A friend of Mrs Donoghue ordered an opaque bottle of [[ginger beer]] (intended for the consumption of Mrs Donoghue) in a café in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]]. Having consumed half of it, Mrs Donoghue poured the remainder into a tumbler. The decomposing remains of a snail floated out. She claimed to have suffered from shock, fell ill with gastroenteritis and sued the manufacturer for carelessly allowing the drink to be contaminated. The [[House of Lords]] decided that the manufacturer was liable for Mrs Donoghue's illness. [[Lord Atkin]] took a distinctly moral approach, and said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The liability for negligence ... is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay ... The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the [[lawyer]]'s question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 532, 580&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This became the basis for the four principles of negligence: (1) Mr Stevenson owed Mrs Donoghue a [[duty of care]] to provide safe drinks (2) he [[Breach of duty in English law|breached]] his duty of care (3) the harm would not have occurred [[causation (law)|but for]] his breach and (4) his act was the [[proximate cause]] of her harm.&lt;ref name="DvS" /&gt; Another example of tort might be a neighbour making excessively loud noises with machinery on his property.&lt;ref name="Sturges"&gt;''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'' (1879) 11 Ch D 852&lt;/ref&gt; Under a [[nuisance]] claim the noise could be stopped. Torts can also involve intentional acts, such as [[assault (tort)|assault]], [[battery (tort)|battery]] or [[trespass]]. A better known tort is [[slander and libel|defamation]], which occurs, for example, when a newspaper makes unsupportable allegations that damage a politician's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. concerning a British politician and the Iraq War, ''[[George Galloway#Daily Telegraph libel case|George Galloway v Telegraph Group Ltd]]'' [2004] EWHC 2786&lt;/ref&gt; More infamous are economic torts, which form the basis of [[labour law]] in some countries by making trade unions liable for strikes,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Taff Vale Railway Co v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants]]'' [1901] AC 426&lt;/ref&gt; when statute does not provide immunity.&lt;ref&gt;In the UK, [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]]; c.f. in the U.S., [[National Labor Relations Act]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Property law ===
{{Main|Property law}}
[[File:South Sea Bubble.jpg|thumb|A painting of the [[South Sea Bubble]], one of the world's first ever speculations and crashes, led to strict regulation on share trading.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''The Bubble Act'', 610–627&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Property]] law governs ownership and possession. [[Real property]], sometimes called 'real estate', refers to ownership of land and things attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd]]'' [1997] [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldjudgmt/jd970424/hunter01.htm 2 All ER 426]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Personal property]], refers to everything else; movable objects, such as computers, cars, jewelry or intangible rights, such as [[share (finance)|stocks and shares]]. A right ''[[in rem]]'' is a right to a specific piece of property, contrasting to a right ''[[in personam]]'' which allows compensation for a loss, but not a particular thing back. Land law forms the basis for most kinds of property law, and is the most complex. It concerns [[mortgage law|mortgages]], [[leasehold estate|rental agreements]], [[license|licences]], [[Covenant (law)|covenants]], [[easement]]s and the statutory systems for land registration. Regulations on the use of personal property fall under intellectual property, [[company (law)|company law]], [[trust law|trusts]] and [[commercial law]]. An example of a basic case of most property law is ''[[Armory v Delamirie]]'' [1722].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Armory v Delamirie]]'' (1722) 93 ER 664, 1 Strange 505&lt;/ref&gt; A [[chimney sweep]]'s boy found a jewel encrusted with precious stones. He took it to a goldsmith to have it valued. The goldsmith's apprentice looked at it, sneakily removed the stones, told the boy it was worth three [[Halfpenny (British coin)|halfpence]] and that he would buy it. The boy said he would prefer the jewel back, so the apprentice gave it to him, but without the stones. The boy sued the goldsmith for his apprentice's attempt to cheat him. [[Lord Chief Justice Pratt]] ruled that even though the boy could not be said to own the jewel, he should be considered the rightful keeper ("finders keepers") until the original owner is found. In fact the apprentice and the boy both had a right of ''[[Possession (law)|possession]]'' in the jewel (a technical concept, meaning evidence that something ''could'' belong to someone), but the boy's possessory interest was considered better, because it could be shown to be first in time. Possession may be nine tenths of the law, but not all.

This case is used to support the view of property in common law jurisdictions, that the person who can show the best claim to a piece of property, against any contesting party, is the owner.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, ''The Man of Property'', 251–274&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the classic civil law approach to property, propounded by [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]], is that it is a right good against the world. Obligations, like contracts and torts, are conceptualised as rights good between individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Savigny, ''Das Recht des Besitzes'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20080418181513/http://dlib-pr.mpier.mpg.de/m/kleioc/0010/exec/bigpage/%22235083_00000057%22 25]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of property raises many further philosophical and political issues. Locke argued that our "lives, liberties and estates" are our property because we own our bodies and [[Labour theory of property|mix our labour]] with our surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''[[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government|Second Treatise on Civil Government]]'', Chap. IX. Of the Ends of Political Society and Government. Chapter 9, section 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equity and trusts ===
{{Main|Equity (law)|Trust law|}}
[[File:Court of Chancery edited.jpg|thumb|The [[Court of Chancery]], London, early 19th century]]

Equity is a body of rules that developed in England separately from the "common law". The common law was administered by judges and barristers. The [[Lord Chancellor]] on the other hand, as the King's keeper of conscience, could overrule the judge-made law if he thought it equitable to do so.&lt;ref&gt;McGhee, ''Snell's Equity'', 7&lt;/ref&gt; This meant equity came to operate more through [[Maxims of equity|principles]] than rigid rules. For instance, whereas neither the common law nor civil law systems allow people to split the ownership from the control of one piece of property, equity allows this through an arrangement known as a 'trust'. 'Trustees' control property, whereas the 'beneficial' (or 'equitable') ownership of trust property is held by people known as 'beneficiaries'. Trustees owe duties to their beneficiaries to take good care of the entrusted property.&lt;ref&gt;c.f. ''[[Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew]]'' [1998] Ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the early case of ''[[Keech v Sandford]]'' [1722]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Keech v Sandford]]'' (1726) Sel Cas Ch 61&lt;/ref&gt; a child had inherited the [[lease]] on a [[Romford Market|market]] in [[Romford]], London. Mr Sandford was entrusted to look after this property until the child matured. But before then, the lease expired. The landlord had (apparently) told Mr Sandford that he did not want the child to have the renewed lease. Yet the landlord was happy (apparently) to give Mr Sandford the opportunity of the lease instead. Mr Sandford took it. When the child (now Mr Keech) grew up, he sued Mr Sandford for the profit that he had been making by getting the market's lease. Mr Sandford was meant to be trusted, but he put himself in a position of [[conflict of interest]]. The [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Peter King, 1st Baron King|Lord King]], agreed and ordered Mr Sandford should disgorge his profits. He wrote,

{{quote|I very well see, if a trustee, on the refusal to renew, might have a lease to himself few trust-estates would be renewed … This may seem very hard, that the trustee is the only person of all mankind who might not have the lease; but it is very proper that the rule should be strictly pursued and not at all relaxed.}}

Of course, Lord King LC was worried that trustees might exploit opportunities to use trust property for themselves instead of looking after it. Business speculators using trusts had just recently caused a [[South Sea Bubble|stock market crash]]. Strict duties for trustees made their way into company law and were applied to directors and chief executive officers. Another example of a trustee's duty might be to invest property wisely or sell it.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nestlé v National Westminster Bank plc]]'' [1993] 1 WLR 1260&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially the case for pension funds, the most important form of trust, where investors are trustees for people's savings until retirement. But trusts can also be set up for [[charitable trust|charitable purposes]], famous examples being the [[British Museum]] or the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].

=== Further disciplines ===
Law spreads far beyond the core subjects into virtually every area of life. Three categories are presented for convenience, though the subjects intertwine and overlap.

;Law and society
[[File:Unison strike rally Oxford 20060328.jpg|thumb|A trade union protest by [[UNISON]] while on strike]]
* '''[[Labour law]]''' is the study of a tripartite industrial relationship between worker, employer and trade union. This involves [[collective bargaining]] regulation, and the right to strike. Individual employment law refers to workplace rights, such as [[job security]], [[Occupational safety and health|health and safety]] or a [[minimum wage]].
* '''Human rights''', [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] and [[human rights law]] are important fields to guarantee everyone basic freedoms and entitlements. These are laid down in codes such as the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (which founded the [[European Court of Human Rights]]) and the [[United States Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]]. The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] makes the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] legally binding in all member states [[Opt-outs in the European Union#Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union – Poland and the United Kingdom|except Poland and the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/guide_to_treaty_of_lisbon.pdf A Guide to the Treaty of Lisbon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910001253/http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/guide_to_treaty_of_lisbon.pdf |date=10 September 2008 }}, The Law Society&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Civil procedure]]''' and '''[[criminal procedure]]''' concern the rules that courts must follow as a trial and appeals proceed. Both concern a citizen's [[right to a fair trial]] or hearing.
* '''[[Evidence (law)|Evidence]]''' law involves which materials are admissible in courts for a case to be built.
* '''[[Immigration law]]''' and '''[[nationality law]]''' concern the rights of foreigners to live and work in a nation-state that is not their own and to acquire or lose [[citizenship]]. Both also involve the [[right of asylum]] and the problem of [[statelessness|stateless]] individuals.
* '''[[Social security]]''' law refers to the rights people have to social insurance, such as jobseekers' allowances or housing benefits.
* '''[[Family law]]''' covers marriage and divorce proceedings, the rights of children and rights to property and money in the event of separation.
* '''[[Transactional law]]''' refers to the practice of law concerning business and money.

;Law and commerce
* '''[[Company law]]''' sprang from the law of trusts, on the principle of separating ownership of property and control.&lt;ref&gt;Berle, ''Modern Corporation and Private Property''&lt;/ref&gt; The law of the modern [[company (law)|company]] began with the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1856]], passed in the United Kingdom, which provided investors with a simple registration procedure to gain [[limited liability]] under the [[Juristic person|separate legal personality]] of the corporation.
* '''[[Commercial law]]''' covers complex contract and property law. The law of [[agency (law)|agency]], [[insurance law]], [[negotiable instrument|bills of exchange]], [[insolvency]] and [[bankruptcy law]] and sales law are all important, and trace back to the medieval ''[[Law Merchant|Lex Mercatoria]]''. The UK [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] and the US [[Uniform Commercial Code]] are examples of codified common law commercial principles.
* '''[[Admiralty law]]''' and the '''[[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]]''' lay a basic framework for free trade and commerce across the world's oceans and seas, where outside of a country's zone of control. Shipping companies operate through ordinary principles of commercial law, generalised for a global market. Admiralty law also encompasses specialised issues such as [[marine salvage|salvage]], [[Lien#Maritime liens|maritime liens]], and injuries to passengers.
* '''[[Intellectual property law]]''' aims at safeguarding creators and other producers of intellectual goods and services. These are legal rights ([[copyright]]s, trademarks, patents, and [[related right]]s) which result from intellectual activity in the industrial, literary and artistic fields.&lt;ref&gt;WIPO, ''Intellectual Property'', 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Restitution]]''' deals with the recovery of someone else's gain, rather than [[Damages|compensation]] for one's own loss.
* '''[[Unjust enrichment]]''' When someone has been unjustly enriched (or there is an "absence of basis" for a transaction) at another's expense, this event generates the right to restitution to reverse that gain.
* '''[[Space law]]''' is a relatively new field dealing with aspects of international law regarding human activities in Earth orbit and outer space.  While at first addressing space relations of countries via treaties, increasingly it is addressing areas such as [[commercialization of space|space commercialisation]], property, liability, and other issues.

;Law and regulation
[[File:1930-67B.png|thumb|The [[New York Stock Exchange]] trading floor after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], before tougher [[banking regulation]] was introduced]]
* '''[[Tax law]]''' involves regulations that concern [[value added tax]], [[corporate tax]], and [[income tax]].
* '''[[Bank regulation|Banking law]]''' and [[financial regulation]] set minimum standards on the amounts of capital banks must hold, and rules about best practice for investment. This is to insure against the risk of economic crises, such as the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].
* '''Regulation''' deals with the provision of [[public services]] and utilities. '''[[Water law]]''' is one example. Especially since [[privatization|privatisation]] became popular and took management of services away from public law, private companies doing the jobs previously controlled by government have been bound by varying degrees of social responsibility. [[Energy policy|Energy]], [[Ofgem|gas]], [[telecommunication policy|telecomms]] and [[water law|water]] are regulated industries in most [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries.
* '''[[Competition law]]''', known in the U.S. as [[antitrust]] law, is an evolving field that traces as far back as [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] decrees against [[price fixing]] and the English [[restraint of trade]] doctrine. Modern competition law derives from the U.S. anti-cartel and anti-monopoly statutes (the [[Sherman Act]] and [[Clayton Act]]) of the turn of the 20th century. It is used to control businesses who attempt to use their economic influence to distort market prices at the expense of [[consumer welfare]].
* '''[[Consumer protection|Consumer law]]''' could include anything from regulations on unfair [[contractual terms]] and clauses to directives on airline baggage insurance.
* '''[[Environmental law]]''' is increasingly important, especially in light of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and the potential danger of [[climate change]]. Environmental protection also serves to penalise [[pollution|polluters]] within domestic legal systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7198">In [[applied mathematics]], the '''Leslie matrix''' is a [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]], [[Age class structure|age-structured]] model of [[population growth]] that is very popular in [[population ecology]]. It was invented by and named after Patrick H. Leslie. The Leslie [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] (also called the Leslie model) is one of the most well known ways to describe the growth of populations (and their projected age distribution), in which a population is closed to migration, growing in an unlimited environment, and where only one sex, usually the [[female]], is considered.

The Leslie matrix is used in [[ecology]] to model the changes in a population of organisms over a period of time. In a Leslie model, the population is divided into groups based on age classes.  A similar model which replaces age classes with [[ontogenetic stage]]s is called a Lefkovitch matrix,&lt;ref&gt;Hal Caswell (2001). Matrix Population Models: Construction, Analysis, and Interpretation. Sinauer.&lt;/ref&gt; whereby individuals can both remain in the same stage class or move on to the next one. At each time step, the population is represented by a [[vector (geometric)|vector]] with an element for each age class where each element indicates the number of individuals currently in that class.

The Leslie matrix is a square matrix with the same number of rows and columns as the population vector has elements. The (i,j)th cell in the matrix indicates how many individuals will be in the age class ''i'' at the next time step for each individual in stage ''j''. At each time step, the population vector is multiplied by the Leslie matrix to generate the population vector for the subsequent time step.

To build a matrix, some information must be known from the population:

* &lt;math&gt;n_x&lt;/math&gt;, the count of individuals (''n'') of each age class ''x''
* &lt;math&gt;s_x&lt;/math&gt;, the fraction of individuals that survives from age class ''x'' to age class ''x+1'',
* &lt;math&gt;f_x&lt;/math&gt;, [[fecundity]], the [[per capita]] average number of female offspring reaching &lt;math&gt;n_0&lt;/math&gt; born from mother of the age class ''x''. More precisely, it can be viewed as the number of offspring produced at the next age class &lt;math&gt;b_{x+ 1}&lt;/math&gt; weighted by the probability of reaching the next age class. Therefore &lt;math&gt;f_x = s_xb_{x+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

From the observations that &lt;math&gt;n_0&lt;/math&gt; at time ''t+1'' is simply the sum of all offspring born from the previous time step and that the organisms surviving to time ''t+1'' are the organisms at time ''t'' surviving at probability &lt;math&gt;s_x&lt;/math&gt;, one gets &lt;math&gt; n_{x+1} = s_xn_x&lt;/math&gt;. This then implies the following matrix representation:

:&lt;math&gt;
 \begin{bmatrix}
   n_0 \\
   n_1 \\
   \vdots \\
   n_{\omega - 1} \\
 \end{bmatrix}_{t+1}
=
 \begin{bmatrix}
f_0 &amp; f_1 &amp; f_2 &amp; \ldots &amp; f_{\omega  - 2} &amp; f_{\omega  - 1} \\
s_0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; s_1 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; s_2 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; s_{\omega - 2}  &amp; 0
 \end{bmatrix}
 \begin{bmatrix}
  n_0 \\ n_1 \\ \vdots\\ n_{\omega - 1}
 \end{bmatrix}_{t}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum age attainable in the population.

This can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_{t+1} = \mathbf{L}\mathbf{n}_t&lt;/math&gt;

or:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_{t} = \mathbf{L}^t\mathbf{n}_0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_t&lt;/math&gt; is the population vector at time ''t'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt; is the Leslie matrix. The dominant [[eigenvalue]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, gives the population's asymptotic growth rate (growth rate at the stable age distribution). The corresponding [[eigenvector]] provides the stable age distribution, the proportion of individuals of each age within the population. Once the stable age distribution has been reached, a population undergoes [[exponential growth]] at rate &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[characteristic polynomial]] of the matrix is given by the [[Euler–Lotka equation]].

The Leslie model is very similar to a discrete-time [[Markov chain]]. The main difference
is that in a Markov model, one would have &lt;math&gt;f_x+s_x=1&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,
while the Leslie model may have these sums greater or less than&amp;nbsp;1.

==Stable age structure==
This age-structured growth model suggests a steady-state, or stable, age-structure and growth rate. Regardless of the initial population size, &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt;, or age distribution, the population tends asymptotically to this age-structure and growth rate. It also returns to this state following perturbation. The [[Euler&amp;ndash;Lotka equation]] provides a means of identifying the intrinsic growth rate. The stable age-structure is determined both by the growth rate and the survival function (i.e. the Leslie matrix). For example, a population with a large intrinsic growth rate will have a disproportionately “young” age-structure. A population with high mortality rates at all ages (i.e. low survival) will have a similar age-structure. Charlesworth (1980) provides further details on the rate and form of convergence to the stable age-structure.

==The random Leslie case==
There is a generalization of the population growth rate to when a Leslie matrix has random elements which may be correlated. When characterizing the disorder, or uncertainties, in vital parameters; a perturbative formalism has to be used to deal with linear non-negative [[random matrix]] [[Matrix difference equation|difference equations]]. Then the non-trivial, effective eigenvalue which defines the long-term asymptotic dynamics of the mean-value population state vector can be presented as the effective growth rate. This eigenvalue and the associated mean-value invariant state vector can be calculated from the smallest positive root of a secular polynomial and the residue of the mean-valued Green function. Exact and perturbative results can thusly be analyzed for several models of disorder.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16635">A '''logarithmic number system''' ('''LNS''') is an arithmetic system used for representing [[real number]]s in computer and [[Digital electronics|digital hardware]], especially for [[digital signal processing]].

==Overview==

In an LNS, a number, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, is represented by the [[logarithm]], &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, of its [[absolute value]] as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;X\rightarrow\{s,x=\log_b(|X|)\},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is a bit denoting the sign of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;s=0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;X&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s=1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;).

The number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is represented by a binary word which usually is in the [[two's complement]] format. An LNS can be considered as a [[floating-point]] number with the [[significand]] being always equal to 1 and a non-integer [[Exponentiation|exponent]]. This formulation simplifies the operations of multiplication, division, powers and roots, since they are reduced down to addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, respectively.

On the other hand, the operations of addition and subtraction are more complicated and they are calculated by the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;\log_b(|X|+|Y|)=x+s_b(y-x)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \log_b(||X|-|Y||)=x+d_b(y-x),&lt;/math&gt;

where the "sum" function is defined by &lt;math&gt;s_b(z)=\log_b(1+b^z)&lt;/math&gt;, and the "difference" function by &lt;math&gt;d_b(z)=\log_b(|1-b^z|)&lt;/math&gt;. These functions &lt;math&gt;s_b(z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d_b(z)&lt;/math&gt; are also known as [[Gaussian logarithm]]s.

The simplification of multiplication, division, roots, and powers is counterbalanced by the cost of evaluating these functions for addition and subtraction. This added cost of evaluation may not be critical when using an LNS primarily for increasing the precision of floating-point math operations.

== {{anchor|SLNS|Focus}}History ==

Logarithmic number systems have been [[Multiple discovery|independently invented]] and published at least three times as an alternative to [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] and [[floating-point]] number systems.&lt;ref name="Lee_1979_1"/&gt;

Nicholas Kingsbury and Peter Rayner introduced "logarithmic arithmetic" for [[digital signal processing]] (DSP) in 1971.&lt;ref name="Kingsbury_1971"/&gt;

A similar LNS named "signed logarithmic number system" (SLNS) was described in 1975 by Earl Swartzlander and Aristides Alexopoulos; rather than use two's complement notation for the logarithms, they [[offset binary|offset]] them (scale the numbers being represented) to avoid negative logs.&lt;ref name="Swartzlander_1975"/&gt;

Samuel Lee and Albert Edgar described a similar system, which they called the "Focus" number system, in 1977.&lt;ref name="Lee_1977_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee_1979_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee_1977_2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee_1979_2"/&gt;

The mathematical foundations for addition and subtraction in an LNS trace back to [[Zecchini Leonelli]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in the early 1800s.&lt;ref name="Leonelli_1802"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leonhardi_1806"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gauss_1808"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Theodora"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunnington_2004"/&gt;

== {{anchor|GRAPE|ELM}}Applications ==

A LNS has been used in the [[Gravity Pipe]] ([[GRAPE-5]]) special-purpose supercomputer&lt;ref name="Makino_1998"/&gt; that won the [[Gordon Bell Prize]] in 1999.

A substantial effort to explore the applicability of LNSs as a viable alternative to floating point for general-purpose processing of single-precision real numbers is described in the context of the ''European Logarithmic Microprocessor'' (ELM).&lt;ref name="Coleman_2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coleman_2008"/&gt; A fabricated prototype of the processor, which has a 32-bit cotransformation-based LNS [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU), demonstrated LNSs as a "more accurate alternative to floating-point", with improved speed. Further improvement of the LNS design based on the ELM architecture has shown its capability to offer significantly higher speed and accuracy than floating-point as well.&lt;ref name="Ismail_2011"/&gt;

LNSs are sometimes used in [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]]-based applications where most arithmetic operations are multiplication or division.&lt;ref name="Fu_2006"/&gt;

The '''minimum intelligent signal test''', or '''MIST''', is a variation of the [[Turing test]] proposed by [[Chris McKinstry]] in which only [[Wiktionary:boolean|boolean]] (yes/no or true/false) answers may be given to questions.  The purpose of such a test is to provide a quantitative statistical measure of ''humanness'', which may subsequently be used to optimize the performance of [[artificial intelligence]] systems intended to imitate human responses.

McKinstry gathered approximately 80,000 propositions that could be answered yes or no, e.g.:

* Is Earth a planet?
* Was Abraham Lincoln once President of the United States?
* Is the sun bigger than my foot?
* Do people sometimes lie?

He called these propositions [[Mindpixel]]s.

These questions test both specific knowledge of aspects of culture, and basic facts about the meaning of various words and concepts. It could therefore be compared with the [[SAT]], [[intelligence test]]ing and other controversial measures of mental ability. McKinstry's aim was not to distinguish between shades of intelligence but to identify whether a computer program could be considered intelligent at all.

According to McKinstry, a program able to do much better than chance on a large number of MIST questions would be judged to have some level of intelligence and understanding. For example, on a 20-question test, if a program were guessing the answers at random, it could be expected to score 10 correct on average. But the [[probability]] of a program scoring 20 out of 20 correct by guesswork is only one in 2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e. one in 1,048,576; so if a program were able to sustain this level of performance over several independent trials, with no prior access to the propositions, it should be considered intelligent.

==Discussion==

McKinstry criticized existing approaches to [[artificial intelligence]] such as [[chatterbot]]s, saying that his questions could "kill" AI programs by quickly exposing their weaknesses. He contrasted his approach, a series of direct questions assessing an AI's capabilities, to the Turing test and [[Loebner Prize]] method of engaging an AI in undirected typed conversation.

Critics{{who|date=May 2013}} of the MIST have noted that it would be easy to "kill" a McKinstry-style AI too, due to the impossibility of supplying it with correct answers to all possible yes/no questions by ways of a finite set of human-generated Mindpixels: the fact that an AI can answer the question "Is the sun bigger than my foot?" correctly does not mean that it can answer variations like "Is the sun bigger than (my hand | my liver | an egg yolk | Alpha Centauri A | ...)" correctly, too.

However, the late McKinstry might have replied that a truly intelligent, knowledgeable entity (on a par with humans) would be able to work out answers such as (yes | yes | yes | don't know | ...) by applying its knowledge of the relative sizes of the objects named. In other words, the MIST was intended as a test of AI, not as a suggestion for implementing AI.

It can also be argued that the MIST is a more objective test of intelligence than the Turing test, a subjective assessment that some might consider to be more a measure of the interrogator's gullibility than of the machine's intelligence. According to this argument, a human's judgment of a Turing test is vulnerable to the [[ELIZA effect]], a tendency to mistake superficial signs of intelligence for the real thing, [[anthropomorph]]izing the program. The response, suggested by [[Alan Turing]]'s essay "Can Machines Think?", is that if a program is a convincing imitation of an intelligent being, it is in fact intelligent. The dispute is thus over what it means for a program to have "real" intelligence, and by what signs it can be detected.

A similar debate exists in the controversy over [[Great Ape language]], in which nonhuman primates are said to have learned some aspects of sign languages but the significance of this learning is disputed.

The '''orienting response''' ('''OR'''), also called ''orienting reflex'', is an organism's immediate response to a change in its environment, when that change is not sudden enough to elicit the [[startle response |startle reflex]]. The phenomenon was first described by Russian physiologist [[Ivan Sechenov]] in his 1863 book ''Reflexes of the Brain'', and the term ('ориентировочный рефлекс' in Russian) was coined by [[Ivan Pavlov]], who also referred to it as the ''Shto takoye?'' (Что такое? or ''What is it?'') reflex. The orienting response is a reaction to novel or significant stimuli. In the 1950s the orienting response was studied systematically by the Russian scientist [[Eugene N. Sokolov|Evgeny Sokolov]], who documented the phenomenon called "[[habituation]]", referring to a gradual "familiarity effect" and reduction of the orienting response with repeated stimulus presentations.&lt;ref name="Sokolov, E.N 1960, pp. 187"&gt;Sokolov, E.N, Neuronal models and the orienting reflex, in ''The Central Nervous System and Behavior'', Mary A.B. Brazier, ed. NY: JosiahMacy, Jr. Foundation, 1960, pp. 187–276&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have found a number of [[physiological]] mechanisms associated with OR, including changes in phasic and tonic [[skin conductance response]] (SCR), [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG), and heart rate following a novel or significant stimulus.  These observations all occur within seconds of stimulus introduction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8986.2008.00702.x | last1 = Bradley | first1 = M.M. | year = 2008 | title = Natural selective attention: Orienting and emotion | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 1–11 | pmid = 18778317 | pmc = 3645482 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, EEG studies of OR have corresponded particularly with the [[P300 (neuroscience)|P300]] wave and [[P3a]] component of the OR-related [[event-related potential]] (ERP).&lt;ref name="fMRI"&gt;Polich, J. (2003). Overview of P3a and P3b. In J. Polich (Ed.), Detection of Change:Event-Related Potential and fMRI Findings (pp. 83-98). Kluwer Academic Press: Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neural correlates==

Current understanding of the localization of OR in the brain is still unclear.  In one study using [[fMRI]] and SCR, researchers found novel visual stimuli associated with SCR responses typical of an OR also corresponded to activation in the [[hippocampus]], [[anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate gyrus]], and [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]].  These regions are also believed to be largely responsible for emotion, decision making, and memory.  Increases in cerebellar and extrastriate cortex were also recorded, which are significantly implicated in visual perception and processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00001756-200009110-00037| last1 = Williams | first1 = L | last2 = Brammer | first2 = M | last3 = Skerrett | first3 = D | last4 = Lagapolous | first4 = J | last5 = Rennie | first5 = C | last6 = Kozek | first6 = K | last7 = Oliveri | first7 = G | last8 = Peduto | first8 = T | last9 = Gordon | first9 = E | year = 2000 | title = The neural correlates of orienting: An integration of fMRI and skin conductance orienting | url = http://tamu.edu/faculty/bortfeld/689/689_Spring'07/readings/Williams_etal_NR2000.pdf| journal = Brain Imaging | volume = 11 | issue = 13| pages = 3011–3015 | pmid =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
When an individual encounters a novel environmental stimulus, such as a bright flash of light or a sudden loud noise, he or she will pay attention to it even before identifying it. This orienting reflex seems to be present early in development, as babies will turn their head toward an environmental change{Cowan, 1995}.  From an evolutionary perspective, this mechanism is useful in reacting quickly to events that call for immediate action.

===Habituation===
Sokolov's investigation of OR was primarily motivated in understanding habituation.  Provided the first introduction of a novel stimulus, defined in Sokolovian terms as any change from the "currently active neuronal model" (what the individual is currently focused on), results in OR.  However, with repeated introduction of the same stimulus, the orienting response will decrease in intensity and eventually cease.&lt;ref name="Sokolov, E.N 1960, pp. 187"/&gt;  When novel stimuli have an associated contextual significance, repeated stimulus will still result in a sequentially decreasing OR, though at a modified rate of decay.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Orienting in decision-making===
The orienting response is believed to play an integral role in preference formation.   When faced with deciding between two options, subjects in studies by Simion &amp; Shimojo were shown to choose the items they preferentially orient their gaze toward.  This gaze can occur while the stimulus is present or after it has been removed, the latter causing gaze to be fixated at the point in which the stimulus had been present.  Gaze bias ceases following a decision, suggesting that gaze bias is the cause of preference and not its effect. Noting this postulated causal link with the irrelevance of a stimulus presence, it is argued that gaze orientation supports decision-making mechanisms in inducing a preferential bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3758/bf03193916| last1 = Simion | first1 = C | last2 = Shimojo | first2 = S | year = 2007 | title = Interrupting the cascade: Orienting contributes to decision making even in the absence of visual stimulation | url = | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 69 | issue = 4| pages = 591–595 | pmid = 17727112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role between emotion and attention===
Both novelty and significance of a stimulation are implicated in the generation of an orienting response.  Specifically, the emotional significance of a stimulus, defined by its level of pleasantness, can affect the intensity of the orienting response toward focusing attention on a subject.  Studies showed that during exposure to neutral and emotionally significant novel images, both pleasant and unpleasant images produced higher skin conductance readings than neutral images.   With repeated stimulation, all skin conductance readings diminished relative to novel introduction, though with emotionally significant content diminishing more slowly.  Conversely, studies observing cardiac deceleration during novel stimuli introduction showed significantly more deceleration for unpleasant stimuli compared to pleasant and neutral stimuli.  These findings suggest that OR represents a combination of responses that act in tandem to a common stimulus.  More importantly, the differences between emotionally charged and neutral stimuli demonstrates the influence of emotion in orienting attention, despite novelty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
In his 2007 book ''[[The Assault on Reason]]'', [[Al Gore]] posited that watching television affects the orienting response, an effect similar to [[vicarious traumatization]].

'''Performance art''' is a performance presented to an audience within a fine art context, traditionally [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]]. Performance may be either scripted or unscripted, random or carefully orchestrated, spontaneous or otherwise carefully planned with or without audience participation. The performance can be live or via media; the performer can be present or absent. It can be any situation that involves four basic elements: time, space, the performer's body, or presence in a medium, and a relationship between performer and audience. Performance art can happen anywhere, in any type of venue or setting and for any length of time. The actions of an individual or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work.

==Visual arts, performing arts, art performance==
[[File:Lubo Kristek,2007,Requiem für die Mobiltelephone,Wien.jpg|thumb|left|''Requiem für die Mobiltelephone'' by [[Lubo Kristek]], 2007, [[Vienna]]]]
Performance art is an essentially contested concept: any single definition of it implies the recognition of rival uses. As concepts like "democracy" or "art", it implies productive disagreement with itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Carlson | first1 = Marvin | title = Performance: A Critical Introduction | publisher = Routledge | year = 1998 (first 1996) | location = London and New York | pages = 1, 2 | isbn = 0-415-13703-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of the term in the narrower sense is related to postmodernist traditions in Western culture. From about the mid-1960s into the 1970s, often derived from concepts of visual art, with respect to [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Dada]], the [[Situationist]]s, [[Fluxus]], [[installation art]] and [[conceptual art]], performance art tended to be defined as an [[antithesis]] to [[theatre]], challenging orthodox art forms and cultural norms. The ideal had been an ephemeral and authentic experience for performer and audience in an event that could not be repeated, captured or purchased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Parr | first1 = Adrian | title = Becoming + Performance Art | editors = Adrian Parr | work = The Deleuze Dictionary | publisher = Edinburgh University Press | year = 2005 | pages = 25, 2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OsVOy4s1QLMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2010-10-26 | isbn = 0748618996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The widely discussed difference, how concepts of visual arts and concepts of performing arts are utilized, can determine the meanings of a performance art presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Carlson | first1 = Marvin | title = Performance: A Critical Introduction | publisher = Routledge | year = 1998 (first 1996) | location = London and New York | pages = 103–105 | isbn = 0-415-13703-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance art is a term usually reserved to refer to a [[conceptual art]] which conveys a content-based meaning in a more drama-related sense, rather than being simple performance for its own sake for entertainment purposes. It largely refers to a performance presented to an audience, but which does not seek to present a conventional theatrical play or a formal linear narrative, or which alternately does not seek to depict a set of fictitious characters in formal scripted interactions. It therefore can include action or spoken word as a communication between the artist and audience, or even ignore expectations of an audience, rather than following a script written beforehand.

Some kinds of performance art nevertheless can be close to performing arts. Such performance may utilize a script or create a fictitious dramatic setting, but still constitute performance art in that it does not seek to follow the usual dramatic norm of creating a fictitious setting with a linear script which follows conventional real-world dynamics; rather, it would intentionally seek to satirize or to transcend the usual real-world dynamics which are used in conventional theatrical plays.

Performance artists often challenge the audience to think in new and unconventional ways, break conventions of traditional arts, and break down conventional ideas about "what art is". As long as the performer does not become a player who repeats a role, performance art can include satirical elements; utilize robots and machines as performers, as in pieces of the [[Survival Research Laboratories]]; involve ritualised elements (e.g. [[Shaun Caton]]); or borrow elements of any [[performing arts]] such as dance, music, and [[circus (performing art)|circus]].

Some artists, e.g. the [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese Actionists]] and [[neo-Dada]]ists, prefer to use the terms "live art", "action art", "actions", "intervention" (see [[art intervention]]) or "manoeuvre" to describe their performing activities. As genres of performance art appear [[body art]], fluxus-performance, [[happening]], [[action poetry]], and [[intermedia]].

==Origins==
[[Image:Le Saut Dans le Vide.jpg|thumb|left|Conceptual work by [[Yves Klein]] at Rue Gentil-Bernard, Fontenay-aux-Roses, October 1960, photo by Shunk Kender. ''Le Saut dans le Vide'' (''Leap into the Void'')]]
Performance art activity is not confined to European or American art traditions; notable practitioners can be found in [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]]. Performance artists and theorists point to different traditions and histories, ranging from tribal to sporting and ritual or religious events. In an episode of ''[[In Our Time (BBC Radio 4)|In Our Time]]'' broadcast on Thu, 20 Oct 2005, 21:30 on BBC Radio 4, [[Angie Hobbs]], Lecturer in Philosophy, University of Warwick; [[Miriam Griffin]], Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford; and [[John Moles]], Professor of Latin, University of Newcastle discussed with [[Melvyn Bragg]] the idea that [[Antisthenes]] and [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]] in ancient Greece practiced a form of performance art and that they acquired the epithet of [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynic]] which means "dog" due to Diogenes behaving repeatedly like a dog in his performances.

Western cultural theorists often trace performance art activity back to the beginning of the 20th century, to the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian constructivists]], [[Futurism|Futurists]] and [[Dada]]. Dada provided a significant progenitor with the unconventional performances of poetry, often at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], by the likes of [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] and [[Tristan Tzara]]. [[Russian Futurist]] artists could be identified as precursors of performance, such as [[David Burliuk]], who painted his face for his actions (1910–20) and [[Alexander Rodchenko]] and his wife [[Varvara Stepanova]].

According to the art critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in the 1940s and 1950s [[Action Painting]] gave artists the freedom to perform—the canvas as "an arena in which to act", thereby rendering the paintings as traces of the artist's performance in his/her studio. [[Abstract expressionism]] and [[Action painting]] preceded the [[Fluxus movement]], [[Happenings]] and the emergence of Performance Art.

Performance art was anticipated, if not explicitly formulated, by [[Japan]]'s [[Gutai group]] of the 1950s, especially in such works as [[Atsuko Tanaka (artist)|Atsuko Tanaka]]'s ''Electric Dress'' (1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/art/reviews/9937/|title=Everything Is Illuminated|website=NYMag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yves Klein]] had been a precursor of performance art with the conceptual pieces of ''[[Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle]]'' (''Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility'') 1959–62, ''Anthropométries'' (1960), and works like the photomontage, Saut dans le vide (Leap into the Void). In the late 1960s [[Land art|Earth artists]] as diverse as [[Robert Smithson]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Michael Heizer]] and [[Carl Andre]] created environmental pieces that predict the performance art of the 1970s. Works of conceptual artists in the early 1980s, like [[Sol LeWitt]], who converted mural-style drawing into an act of performance by others, were influenced by Yves Klein and the Earth artists as well.

==1960s==
[[Image:Schneemann-Interior Scroll.gif|thumb|[[Carolee Schneemann]], performing her piece ''Interior Scroll.'' [[Yves Klein]] in [[France]], and [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], and [[Yoko Ono]] in [[New York City]] were pioneers of performance based works of art, that often entailed nudity.]]
In the 1960s a variety of new works, concepts and the increasing number of artists led to new kinds of performance art.  Prototypic for the artform later explicitly labeled "performance art", were works of artists like [[Yoko Ono]] with her ''Wall piece for orchestra'' (1962), [[Carolee Schneemann]] with pieces like ''Meat Joy'' (1964) and ''Interior Scroll'' (1975);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caroleeschneemann.com/interiorscroll.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wolf Vostell]] with his Happening ''YOU'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/you/|title=Media Art Net - Vostell, Wolf: YOU|first=Media Art|last=Net|date=12 April 2018|website=www.medienkunstnetz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1964 in New York); [[Joseph Beuys]] with ''How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare'' (1965); [[Yayoi Kusama]], with actions such as a naked flag-burning on the Brooklyn Bridge (1968) and [[Allan Kaprow]] in his many ''Happenings''.

Kaprow had coined the term [[Happening]] describing a new artform, at the beginning of the 1960s. A ''Happening'' allows the artist to experiment with body motion, recorded sounds, written and spoken texts, and even smells. One of Kaprow's earliest was "Happenings in the New York Scene," written in 1961 as the form was developing.&lt;ref&gt;Montfort, Nick, and Noah Wardrip-Fruin. The New Media Reader. Cambridge, Massachusetts [u.a.: MIT, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Notably in the Happenings of Allan Kaprow, the audience members become performers. While the audiences in Happenings had been welcomed as the performers, it is only sometimes and often unwittingly that they become an active part in a Performance. Other artists who created Happenings besides Kaprow include [[Jim Dine]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Robert Whitman]], and [[Wolf Vostell]]: ''Theater is in the Street'' (Paris in 1958).

[[Hermann Nitsch]] in 1962 presented his "Theatre of Orgies and Mysteries" (Orgien- und Mysterien Theater), a precursor to performance art, close to the performing arts.

[[Andy Warhol]] during the early 1960s beginning to create films and video,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/andy_warhol_films.html|title=Andy Warhol Films|author=|date=|website=www.warholstars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid-60s sponsored the [[Velvet Underground]] and staged events and performances in New York, like the [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]] (1966) that featured live Rock music, exploding lights, and film.

Indirectly influential for art-world performance, particularly in the United States, were new forms of theatre, embodied by the [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]] and the [[Living Theatre]] and showcased in Off-Off Broadway theaters in SoHO and at [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club|La MaMa]] in New York City. The Living Theatre chiefly toured in Europe between 1963 and 1968, and in the U.S. in 1968. A work of this period, ''Paradise Now'' was notorious for its audience participation and a scene in which actors recited a list of social taboos that included nudity, while disrobing.

The work of performance artists after 1968 often showed influences of the cultural and political events of that year. [[Barbara T. Smith]] with ''Ritual Meal'' (1969) was at the forefront of the feminist body-, and performance art of the 1970s; among others including: [[Carolee Schneemann]], and [[Joan Jonas]]. Schneemann and Jonas along with [[Yoko Ono]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Vito Acconci]], [[Chris Burden]] and [[Dennis Oppenheim]] pioneered the relationship between ''[[Body art]]'' and performance art.

== 1970s ==
[[Image:BeuysAchberg78.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Beuys]], 1978: ''Jeder Mensch ein Künstler — Auf dem Weg zur Freiheitsgestalt des sozialen Organismus'' ("Every person an artist — On the way to the libertarian form of the social organism")]]
At the beginning of the 1970s, artists whose work already before tended to be a performance art, as well as new artists, began to present performance art in a stricter form.

New artists with radical performances were [[Chris Burden]], with the 1971 performance piece ''Shoot'', in which he was shot in his left arm by an assistant from a distance of about five meters, and [[Vito Acconci]] in the same year with ''[[Seedbed (performance piece)|Seedbed]]''.

The book ''[[Expanded Cinema]]'', by [[Gene Youngblood]], marked a shift in the use of media by performance artists. The first book considering video art as an art form, mentions [[Jud Yalkut]] as a pioneering video artist. Since 1965 he had collaborated in dozens of intermedia performances throughout the United States, also with [[Nam June Paik]], who beginning of the 1960s already had been a fluxus performer on the way to become a media artist. As to the art of Paik, Youngblood refers to works of Carolee Schneemann and [[Robert Whitman]] from the 1960s, which had been pioneering for performance art, becoming an independent artform at the beginning of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Youngblood | first1 = Gene | title = Expanded Cinema | publisher = A. Dutton | year = 1970 | location = New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British-based pair [[Gilbert and George]], already in 1970, had documented actions of themselves on video, and created their "living sculpture" performance, being painted in gold and singing "Underneath The Arches" for extended periods. [[Joan Jonas]] began to include video in her experimental performances in 1972.

In 1973, [[Laurie Anderson]] performed ''Duets on Ice'', on the streets of New York City. [[Marina Abramović]], in the performance ''Rhythm 10'', conceptually included the violation of her body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/rhythm-10-2/ | title = Marina Abramović Rhythm 10 | accessdate = 2011-03-24 | publisher = Media Art Net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty years later, the theme of violation, shame, and sexual exploitation would be re-imagined in the contemporary performance works of artists such as  Clifford Owens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gothamist.com/2012/03/09/this_sunday_ps1_may_or_may_not_host.php|title=This Sunday MoMA PS1 May Or May Not Host A "Performance Art Rape"|work=[[Gothamist]]|date=9 March 2012|first=Jen|last=Carlson|accessdate=16 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810231244/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/09/this_sunday_ps1_may_or_may_not_host.php|archivedate=10 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gillian Walsh, [[Pat Oleszko]] and [[Rebecca Patek]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/arts/dance/the-margins-of-a-form-are-increasingly-not-where-they-used-to-be.html?smid=fb-share&amp;_r=0 |title=The Margins of a Form Are, Increasingly, Not Where They Used to Be |work= [[The New York Times]]|date=30 July 2013|first=Gia|last=Kourlas|accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1973, the Feminist Studio Workshop at the [[Woman's Building]] in Los Angeles had a formative impact on the wave of performances with feminist background.

[[Carolee Schneemann]] work in 1963, ''Eye Body'', already had been a prototype of performance art. Schneemann in 1975 drew on with innovative solo performances, like ''Interior Scroll'', showing the female body as an artistic medium.

In the mid seventies, behind the iron curtain, in the Eastern European capitals: Budapest, Kraków, Belgrade, Zagreb, Novi Sad and other cities, the performing art was flourishing. Against the political and social control, emerged [[Orshi Drozdik]] performance series, titled ''Individual Mythology'' 1975/77 and the ''NudeModel'' 1976/77. Critical of the patriarchal discourse of art and the equally patriarchal state forced "emancipation program", pioneering feminist point of view on both, made her forerunner in the 70s political and artistic environment.

In 1976, [[HA Schult]] filled [[Piazza San Marco|St. Mark's Square]] in [[Venice]] with old newspapers in an overnight action he called ''Venezia vive.''&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Battcock and Robert Nickas, ''The Art of Performance: A Critical Anthology'' (Boston, MA: E.P. Dutton, 1984), pp. 330-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Wines, ''De-Architecture'' (New York: Rizzoli International, 1987), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1977 performance, "Crash", the same artist let a [[Cessna]] crash into the garbage dump on [[Staten Island]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lucie-Smith, ''Art in the Seventies'' (Cornell University Press, 1980), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance art, because of its relative transience, by the 1970s, had a fairly robust presence in the [[avant-garde]] of [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, especially [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

== 1980s ==

Until the 1980s, performance art had been demystifying virtuosity. Now it began to embrace technical brilliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Banes | first1 = Sally | title = Subversive expectations: performance art and paratheater in New York, 1976–85 | publisher = The University of Michigan Press | year = 1998 | location = New York, New York | pages = 120, 1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DdrVYfkAm6IC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=1980s+performance+art&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=1980s%20performance%20art&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-23 | isbn = 0-472-09678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to ''Presence and Resistance''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Auslander | first1 = Philip | title = Presence and Resistance: Postmodernism and Cultural politics in Contemporary American Performance | publisher = University of Michigan Press | year = 1992 | location = Ann Arbour | pages = 64–65, 78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Philip Auslander]], dance critic [[Sally Banes]] writes "... by the end of the 1980s, performance art had become so widely known that it no longer needed to be defined; [[mass culture]], especially television, had come to supply both structure and subject matter for much performance art; and several performance artists, including [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Spalding Gray]], [[Eric Bogosian]], [[Willem Dafoe]], and [[Ann Magnuson]], had indeed become crossover artists in mainstream entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Banes | first1 = Sally | title = Subversive expectations: performance art and paratheater in New York, 1976–85 | publisher = The University of Michigan Press | year = 1998 | location = New York, New York | pages = 10, 1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DdrVYfkAm6IC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=1980s+performance+art&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=1980s%20performance%20art&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-23 | isbn = 0-472-09678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that many performances are held within the circle of a small art-world group, [[RoseLee Goldberg]] notes in ''Performance Art: From Futurism to the Present'' that "performance has been a way of appealing directly to a large public, as well as shocking audiences into reassessing their own notions of art and its relation to culture. Conversely, public interest in the medium, especially in the 1980s, stems from an apparent desire of that public to gain access to the art world, to be a spectator of its ritual and its distinct community, and to be surprised by the unexpected, always unorthodox presentations that the artists devise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0500203393|title=Performance Art: From Futurism to the Present|first=Roselee|last=Goldberg|date=1 June 2001|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the performance art most discussed in the art-world of this decade were a performance by [[Linda Montano]] and [[Tehching Hsieh]] between July 1983 and July 1984, ''Art/Life: One Year Performance'' (Rope Piece), and [[Karen Finley]]'s ''I'm an Ass Man'' 1987.

Until the decline of the European eastern block during the late 1980s, performance art had actively been rejected by most communist governments. With the exception of Poland and Yugoslavia, performance art was more or less banned in countries where any independent public event was feared. In the GDR, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Latvia it happened in apartments, at seemingly spontaneous gatherings in artist studios, in church-controlled settings, or covered as another activity, like a photo-shooting. Isolated of the western conceptual context, in different settings it could be like a playful protest or like a bitter comment, using subversive metaphors to express dissent with the political situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://perfomap.de/current/kart/reclaiming-the-invisible | title = Reclaiming the Invisible Past of Eastern Europe | accessdate = 2011-03-23 | last = Zajanckauska | first = Zane | author2 = Interview with Ieva Astahovska | publisher = map - media archive performance | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110416151339/http://perfomap.de/current/kart/reclaiming-the-invisible | archivedate = 2011-04-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1982, [[Hedwig Gorski]] designated the term [[performance poetry]], to distinguish her text-based vocal performances from performance art, especially the work of performance artists, such as Laurie Anderson, who worked with music at that time. Performance poets relied more on the rhetorical and philosophical expression in their poetics than performance artists, who arose from the visual art genres of painting and sculpture.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

From 1981 to 1994, the Dutch visual artist [[PINK de Thierry]] created what she came to call meta-performances: a conceptual mix of intervention art in public space, performance art—interacting with an audience, installation art—utilizing large structures to perform in or with, and media art—photography and film to register and exhibit.

While the [[Soviet bloc]] disintegrated, formerly repressed activities of performance artists like [[György Galántai]] in Hungary, or the Collective Action Group in Russia, became better known. Young artists from all over the former Eastern bloc, including Russia, turned to performance. Performance art at about the same time appeared in Cuba, the Caribbean and China. Chinese performance artists like [[Zhang Huan]] had been performing underground since the late 1980s. In the early 1990s [[Chinese performance art]] already was acclaimed in the international art scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Montano | first1 = Linda M. | title = Performance artists talking in the eighties | publisher = University of California Press Berkeley | year = 2000 | location = Los Angeles, London | pages = 479, 1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5Bl6wm-cV_oC&amp;pg=PA479&amp;dq=performance+art+1990s&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=performance%20art&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-31 | isbn = 0-520-21022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In these contexts performance art became a critical new voice with a social force similar to that found in Western Europe, the United States and South America in the 1960s and early 1970s. It should be emphasized that the eruption of performance art in the 1990s in Eastern Europe, China, South Africa, Cuba, and elsewhere should never be considered either secondary to or imitative of the West."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Montano | first1 = Linda M. | title = Performance artists talking in the eighties | publisher = University of California Press University of California Press Berkeley | year = 2000 | location = Los Angeles, London | pages = 479, 2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5Bl6wm-cV_oC&amp;pg=PA479&amp;dq=performance+art+1990s&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=performance%20art&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-31 | isbn = 0-520-21022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1996, [[HA Schult]] has installed one thousand life sized "Trash People" made from garbage as "silent witnesses to a consumer age that has created an ecological imbalance worldwide". They travelled to [[Moscow]]'s [[Red Square]] (1999), the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids of Giza]] (2002) and the [[Great Wall of China]] (2001).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IaIwmEh-OpsC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Carlos Rojas, ''The Great Wall: A Cultural History''] (Harvard University Press, 2010), pp. 163-64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ina-Maria Greverus and Ute Ritschel, eds., ''Aesthetics and Anthropology: Performing Life, Performed Lives'' (Berlin: LIT Verlag, 2009), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kim Levin]], ''ARTnews'', volume=6, 2011, pp. 92-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the western world in the 1990s, even sophisticated performance art became part of the cultural mainstream: performance art as a complete artform gained admittance into art museums and became a museal topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Targ Brill | first1 = Marlene | title = America in the 1990s | publisher = Lerner Publishing Group | year = 2009 | pages = 93, 1 | location = Minneapolis | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BNXeIFQScocC&amp;dq=performance+art+1990s&amp;q=performance#v=snippet&amp;q=performance&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-31 | isbn = 978-0-8225-7603-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the decade, computer-aided forms of performance art began to take place.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Nate (2009), [https://arstechnica.com/web/news/2009/09/horrifically-bad-software-demos-become-performance-art.ars "Horrifically bad software demo becomes performance art"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since January 2003, Tate Modern in London has had a curated programme of live art and performance and in 2012 The Tanks at Tate Modern were opened: the first dedicated spaces for performance, film, and installation in a major modern and contemporary art museum.

From March 14 to May 31, 2010, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] held a major retrospective and performance recreation of [[Marina Abramović]]'s work, the biggest exhibition of performance art in MoMA's history.&lt;ref&gt;Kino, Carol (March 10, 2010).

Retrieved 2010-04-16.&lt;/ref&gt; During the run of the exhibition, Abramović performed ''The Artist is Present'', a 736-hour and 30-minute static, silent piece, in which she sat immobile in the museum's atrium, while spectators were invited to take turns sitting opposite her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/yazmany-arboleda/bringing-marina-flowers_b_592597.html|title=SBringing Marina Flowers|last=Arboleda|first=Yazmany|authorlink=Yazmany Arboleda|date=May 28, 2010|newspaper=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2010-06-16|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vy37wSbU?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/yazmany-arboleda/bringing-marina-flowers_b_592597.html|archivedate=2011-01-24|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A support group for the "sitters", "Sitting with Marina", was established on [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=122578407758954%22|title=Log In or Sign Up to View|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance attracted celebrities such as [[Björk]] and [[James Franco]] and received coverage on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thoughtcatalog.com/2010/marina-abramovic-the-staring-woman-at-moma/ thoughtcatalog.com/2010/marina-abramovic]&lt;/ref&gt; During Marina's performance, other artists performed for her.

== Biography ==

Jacobs was born in Montreal on 3 December 1939. His parents were both natives of [[New York City]]: Jacob Joseph Jacobs graduated from New York University as a chemical engineer and Francis Alexander graduated from Barnard College in ancient languages. His interest in nature and the landscape was nurtured during summer family trips to the ocean and others in the northern boreal forest. His commitment to the urban landscape was derived from his experience of the cultural diversity and convivial social energy of Montreal. He is married to Ellen Vineberg Jacobs, distinguished professor emerita of Concordia University in Montreal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.recherche.umontreal.ca/la-recherche-a-ludem/la-vitrine-des-professeurs/informations/chercheur/495/pid/16/|title=Portail de la recherche: Informations|website=www.recherche.umontreal.ca|language=fr-FR|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobs graduated from Antioch College with a bachelor's degree (1961) in engineering and fine arts. He continued his studies at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], where he obtained a Masters of Architecture degree (1964) followed by a Master of Landscape Architecture degree (1968).&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; He then pursued a program of special studies in human ecology at Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archiv.umontreal.ca/P0000/P0397.html|title=P0397 Fonds Peter Jacobs- Université de Montréal – Division de la gestion de documents et des archives|website=www.archiv.umontreal.ca|language=fr|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his studies, Jacobs pursued both an academic and professional career. After first practicing architecture, he concentrated on landscape planning and urban design. In 1971 he was promoted to associate professor and in 1979 to full professor in the School of Landscape Architecture, Universite de Montreal. He was the school's first director (1978) and the first associate dean of research of the Faculte de l’Amenagement (1977–1984).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web |title=P0397 Fonds Peter Jacobs- Université de Montréal – Division de la gestion de documents et des archives|url=http://www.archiv.umontreal.ca/P0000/P0397.html|last=Udem|first=Archives|website=www.archiv.umontreal.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; He was named Emeritus professor in 2016.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Peter Jacobs is Fellow and past president of the [[Canadian Society of Landscape Architects]] (CSLA) (1978–1980), Fellow of the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA), and served as the Canadian delegate to the [[International Federation of Landscape Architects]] (IFLA) (1986–1995). In 2016, he was named Chair of the Montreal Heritage Council.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/article/2016/12/02/peter-jacobs-nomme-a-la-presidence-du-conseil-du-patrimoine-de-montreal/|title=Peter Jacobs nommé à la présidence du Conseil du patrimoine de Montréal|date=2017-03-17|access-date=2017-04-03|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main achievements and contributions ==

=== Pedagogical development of a new field of studies ===
Jcobs' teaching is based on the structure and meaning of the urban and rural landscape as well as the use of criteria such as belonging, equity, and integrity in the design of landscape form. Due to his expertise, Peter Jacobs has been invited to evaluate numerous academic programs in Canada, Israel, Columbia, France, China and Spain. He has also given intensive courses and design studios in more than 50 universities around the world.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

His research and community activities have focused on the sustainable and equitable development and conservation of the landscape in association with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with the Kativik Environmental Quality Commission as Chair of the Commission (KEQC) since 1979,&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mddelcc.gouv.qc.ca/evaluations/cqek.htm|title=Commission de la qualité de l'environnement Kativik (CQEK)|website=www.mddelcc.gouv.qc.ca|language=fr|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as Chair of the Public Advisory Council for the Canadian State of the Environment Report (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The State of Canada's Environment|last=|first=|publisher=Government of Canada, Canada Communication Group|year=1991|isbn=0-660-14237-6|location=the University of California|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early stages of environmental evaluation ===
Jacobs was one of the early participants in a variety of environmental evaluation formats related to urban development and the North, both as a chair and a member of numerous public commissions. He chaired the public consultation process on the future of Lancaster Sound in the Canadian arctic (1980) and has Chaired the Kativik Environmental Quality Commission in [[Nunavik]] (since 1981).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; He also co-Chaired the public hearings related to the environmental impacts of the [[James Bay Hydroelectric Project|Great Whale Hydoelectric Project]] flowing into [[James Bay]], Quebec (1992–1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nunavik : un environnement en évolution|last=Jacobs|first=Peter|last2=Berrouard|first2=Daniel|last3=Paul|first3=Mireille|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=|editor-last=Commission de la qualité de l’environnement Kativik|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the urban context, he has participated as a commissioner for the Bureau de consultation de Montreal and the Office de consultation Publique de Montreal on files related to the development of urban neighborhoods, urban infrastructure, and the planning and design of large metropolitan parks and nature reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ocpm.qc.ca/commissaire/peter-jacobs|title=Peter Jacobs|date=2015-12-14|work=OCPM|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

In 1990, as a member of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Research Council (CEARC), he co-edited and was one of the chief architects of a research report on ''Sustainable Development and Environmental Assessment : Perspectives on Planning for a Common Future''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sustainable Development and Environmental Assessment : Perspectives on Planning for a Common Future|last=Jacobs|first=Peter|last2=Sadler|first2=Barry|publisher=Canadian Environmental Assessment Research Council|year=1988|isbn=|location=Hull, Quebec|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, he has served as a consultant for programs sponsored by [[UNESCO]], MAB, UNU, and [[IUCN protected area categories|IUCN]].

=== Relationship of landscape and culture ===
One of the principal research fields developed by Jacobs is linked to the impact of culture and cultural values to the perception and management of landscapes. Numerous international missions in Africa, Latin America, Australia, and Europe as well as the arctic landscapes of Northern Quebec have provided a rich array of conditions and experiences that contribute to a diversity of cultural perspectives as to how the landscape is perceived and managed.

His prolonged research visits to Dumbarton Oaks as chair of the Senior Fellows of the Landscape and Garden Studies program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doaks.org/research/garden-landscape|title=Garden and Landscape Studies  — Dumbarton Oaks|last=admin|website=www.doaks.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and subsequently as Beatrix Farrand Distinguished Fellow provided further material with which to evaluate the diverse cultural visions of the landscape.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doaks.org/library-archives/dumbarton-oaks-archives/historical-records/oral-history-project/peter-jacobs|title=Peter Jacobs — Dumbarton Oaks|last=gabrielas|website=www.doaks.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community service ===
Jacobs' commitment to the community is marked by his desire to integrate professional practice with academic research in the service of community growth and development. As chair of the Environmental Planning Commission&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; from 1978–1990, he helped formulate nature conservation programs and action plans for numerous countries. His environmental activities have focused on nature conservancy, the preservation of urban open space, and the development of policy, programs, and plans in support of equitable and sustainable development.

He has served as vice-president of the Solomon Schecter Academy (1973–1976), advisor to the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, member of the intercultural advisory committee of the City of Montreal, and president of the Jewish Public Library of Montreal(1996–2000)&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.federationcja.org/media/singles/1191342115.pdf|title=Rapport Annuel|last=Federation CJA|first=|date=2006–2007|website=www.federationcja.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also served as Chair of the community planning and allocations committee and as a Director of the Federation of Jewish Community Agencies, the United Israel Agencies of Canada and the Canadian Jewish National Fund.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Political philosophy''', also known as '''political theory''', is the study of topics such as [[politics]], [[liberty]], [[justice]], [[property]], [[rights]], [[law]], and the enforcement of laws by [[authority]]: what they are, why (or even if) they are needed, what, if anything, makes a [[The purpose of government|government legitimate]], what rights and freedoms it should protect and why, what form it should take and why, what the law is, and what duties citizens owe to a legitimate government, if any, and when it may be legitimately overthrown, if ever.

In a [[vernacular]] sense, the term "political philosophy" often refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief or attitude, about politics, synonymous to the term "[[political ideology]]".

Political philosophy is a branch of [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Leo (1959). An introduction to Political Philosophy. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[political science]], a strong focus has historically been placed on the role of political philosophy (also known as [[normative theory]]), [[moral philosophy]] and the [[humanities]], although in recent years there has been increased focus to political theory based on [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] methodological approaches as well as [[economic theory]], the [[natural sciences]] and [[behaviouralism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Savigny |first1=Heather |last2=Marsden |first2=Lee |title=Doing Political Science and International Relations: Theories in Action |date=2011 |publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education |isbn=9780230344136 |page=13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CaUcBQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient traditions ===

==== Ancient India ====
[[Indian political philosophy]]  in ancient times demarcated a clear distinction between (1) nation and state (2) religion and state. The constitutions of Hindu states evolved over time and were based on political and legal treatises and prevalent social institutions. The institutions of state were broadly divided into governance, administration, defense, law and order. ''Mantranga,'' the principal governing body of these states, consisted of the King, Prime Minister, Commander in chief of army, Chief Priest of the King. The Prime Minister headed the committee of ministers along with head of executive (Maha Amatya).

[[Chanakya]] was a 4th-century BC Indian political philosopher. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'' provides an account of the science of politics for a wise ruler, policies for foreign affairs and wars, the system of a spy state and surveillance and economic stability of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Roger Boesche|last=Boesche|first=Roger|title=The First Great Political Realist: Kautilya and His Arthashastra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K85NA7Rg67wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn%3A0739106074&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2002|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=0-7391-0401-2|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chanakya quotes several authorities including Bruhaspati, Ushanas, Prachetasa Manu, Parasara, and Ambi, and described himself as a descendant of a lineage of political philosophers, with his father Chanaka being his immediate predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rangarajan|first1=L N|title=The Arthashastra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3jbzZkoR36QC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PT22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2000|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=9788184750119|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another influential extant Indian treatise on political philosophy is the Sukra Neeti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=D.

Sewell and J. Debrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ancient China ====
Chinese political philosophy dates back to the [[Spring and Autumn period]], specifically with Confucius in the 6th century BC. Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn period and the [[Warring States period]]. The major philosophies during the period, [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], [[Mohism]], [[School of Agrarianism|Agrarianism]] and [[Taoism]], each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], and [[Mozi]], focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly [[authoritarian]] government based on [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] punishments and laws. [[Mohism]] advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on [[frugality]] and [[ascetism]]. The Agrarians advocated a peasant [[utopian]] [[communalism]] and [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deutsch|first=Eliot|author2=Ronald Bontekoei|year=1999|page=183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taoism advocated a proto-[[anarchism]]. Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the [[Qin Dynasty]], but was replaced by State Confucianism in the [[Han Dynasty]]. Prior to China's adoption of [[communism]], State Confucianism remained the dominant political philosophy of China up to the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hsü|first=Leonard Shihlien|title=The political philosophy of Confucianism|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FWFtQIyun-8C|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-36154-5|pages=xvii–xx|quote=The importance of a scientific study of Confucian political philosophy could hardly be overstated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ancient Greece ====
Western political philosophy originates in the philosophy of [[ancient Greece]], where political philosophy dates back to at least Plato.&lt;ref name="Sahakian 1993 59"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sahakian|first=Mabel Lewis|title=Ideas of the great philosophers|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vi7cQMw8SwYC&amp;pg=PA59|year=1993|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing|isbn=978-1-56619-271-2|page=59|quote=... Western philosophical tradition can be traced back as early as Plato (427–347 BC).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greece was dominated by city-states, which experimented with various forms of political organization, grouped by Plato into five categories of descending stability and morality: [[monarchy]], [[timocracy]],[[oligarchy]], [[democracy]] and [[tyranny]]. One of the first, extremely important classical works of political philosophy is Plato's ''Republic'',&lt;ref name="Sahakian 1993 59"/&gt; which was followed by [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kraut|first=Richard|title=Aristotle: political philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9BDmX3FBbS4C&amp;pg=PA3|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-878200-1|page=3|quote=To understand and assess Aristotle's contributions to political thought ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman political philosophy was influenced by the [[Stoics]] and the Roman statesman [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Radford|first=Robert T.|title=Cicero: a study in the origins of republican philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1cKLGcvuYxQC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2002|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-1467-1|page=1|quote=His most lasting political contribution is in his work on political philosophy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Saint Augustine ====

The early [[Christian philosophy]] of [[Augustine of Hippo]] was heavily influenced by Plato. A key change brought about by Christian thought was the moderation of the [[Stoicism]] and theory of [[justice]] of the Roman world, as well emphasis on the role of the state in applying [[mercy]] as a [[moral example]]. Augustine also preached that one was not a member of his or her city, but was either a citizen of the [[City of God (book)|City of God]] (Civitas Dei) or the City of Man ([[Civitas]] Terrena). Augustine's ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' is an influential work of this period that attacked the thesis, held by many Christian Romans, that the Christian view could be realized on [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schall|first=James V.|title=At the Limits of Political Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yZK79kiFFtsC&amp;pg=PA40|year=1998|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-0922-7|page=40|quote=In political philosophy, St. Augustine was a follower of Plato ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== St. Thomas Aquinas ====
{{main|Treatise on Law}}

[[Thomas Aquinas]] meticulously dealt with the varieties of [[philosophy of law|law]]. According to Aquinas, there are four kinds of law:

# Eternal law ("the divine government of everything")
# Divine positive law (having been "posited" by God; external to human nature)
# [[Natural law]] (the right way of living discoverable by natural reason; what cannot-not be known; internal to human nature)
# Human law (what we commonly call "[[law]]"—including [[customary law]]; the law of the ''[[Communitas Perfecta]]'')

Aquinas never discusses the nature or categorization of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]. There is scholarly debate surrounding the place of canon law within the Thomistic jurisprudential framework.

Aquinas was an incredibly influential thinker in the [[Natural law|Natural Law tradition]].

The rise of [[Islam]], based on both the [[Qur'an]] and [[Muhammad]] strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region. [[Early Islamic philosophy]] emphasized an inexorable link between [[science]] and [[religion]], and the process of [[ijtihad]] to find [[truth]]—in effect ''all'' philosophy was "[[Political aspects of Islam|political]]" as it had real implications for governance. This view was challenged by the "rationalist" [[Mutazilite]] philosophers, who held a more [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenic]] view, reason above revelation, and as such are known to modern scholars as the first [[speculative philosophy|speculative]] theologians of Islam; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the [[Caliphate]]. By the late ancient period, however, the "traditionalist" [[Asharite]] view of Islam had in general triumphed. According to the Asharites, reason must be subordinate to the Quran and the Sunna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aslan|first=Reza|authorlink=Reza Aslan|title=No god but God|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AkyupJn81RMC&amp;pg=PA153|year=2005|publisher=Random House Inc.|isbn=978-1-58836-445-6|page=153|quote=By the ninth and tenth centuries... }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic philosophy|Islamic political philosophy]], was, indeed, rooted in the very sources of [[Islam]]—i.e., the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]], the words and practices of Muhammad—thus making it essentially theocratic. However, in the Western thought, it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: [[al-Kindi]] (Alkindus), [[al-Farabi]] (Abunaser), [[Avicenna|İbn Sina]] (Avicenna), [[Ibn Bajjah]] (Avempace) and [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes). The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah (power), [[sultan]], [[ummah]], cemaa (obligation)-and even the "core" terms of the Qur'an—i.e., [[ibadah]] (worship), din (religion), rab (master) and [[ilah]] (deity)—is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other [[Fiqh|jurists]] and [[Ulema|ulama]] posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the [[Kharijites|Khawarij]] in the very early years of [[Muslim history|Islamic history]] on [[Caliphate|Khilafa]] and [[Ummah]], or that of [[Shia Islam]] on the concept of [[Imamah]] are considered proofs of political thought. The clashes between the [[Sunni Islam|Ehl-i Sunna]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]] in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character. Political thought was not purely rooted in theism, however. [[Aristotelianism|Aristotleanism]] flourished as the Islamic Golden Age saw rise to a continuation of the [[Peripatetic school|peripaetic]] philosophers who implemented the ideas of [[Aristotle]] in the context of the Islamic world. Abunaser, Avicenna and Ibn Rushd where part of this philosophical school who claimed that human reason surpassed mere coincidence and revelation. They believed, for example, that natural phenomena occurs because of certain rules (made by god), not because god interfered directly (unlike Al-Ghazali and his followers).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Farabi|title=Al-Fārābī {{!}} Muslim philosopher|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/avicenna/#H5|title=Avicenna (Ibn Sina) {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-22|title=Averroes|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Averroes&amp;oldid=837663527|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Ghazali|title=Al-Ghazālī {{!}} Muslim jurist, theologian, and mystic|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable political philosophers of the time include [[Nizam al-Mulk]], a Persian scholar and [[vizier]] of the Seljuq Empire who composed the ''[[Siyasatnama]]'', or the "Book of Government" in English. In it, he details the role of the state in terms of political affairs (i.e. how to deal with political opponents without ruining the government's image), as well as its duty to protect the poor and reward the worthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-06-30|title=Siyasatnama|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Siyasatnama&amp;oldid=788295179|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his other work, he explains how the state should deal with other issues such as supplying jobs to immigrants like the [[Turkmens]] who were coming from the north (present day southern Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nizam-al-Mulk-Seljuq-vizier|title=Niẓām al-Mulk {{!}} Seljuq vizier|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ibn Khaldun ====

The 14th-century [[Arab]] scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] is considered one of the greatest political theorists. The British philosopher-anthropologist [[Ernest Gellner]] considered Ibn Khaldun's definition of [[government]], "...an institution which prevents injustice other than such as it commits itself," the best in the history of political theory. For Ibn Khaldun, government should be restrained to a minimum for as a necessary evil, it is the constraint of men by other men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gellner|first=Ernest|authorlink=Ernest Gellner|title=Plough, Sword, and Book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WwduQjFiB7kC&amp;pg=PA239|year=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-28702-7|page=239|quote=Ibn Khaldun's definition of government probably remains the best: ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval Europe ===
[[Medieval]] political philosophy in [[Europe]] was heavily influenced by [[Christian]] thinking. It had much in common with the Mutazilite [[Islamic]] thinking in that the [[Roman Catholic]]s though subordinating [[philosophy]] to [[theology]] did not subject reason to revelation but in the case of contradictions, subordinated reason to faith as the Asharite of Islam. The Scholastics by combining the philosophy of Aristotle with the Christianity of St. Augustine emphasized the potential harmony inherent in reason and revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koetsier|first=L. S.|title=Natural Law and Calvinist Political Theory|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7uLE3DynB0YC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2004|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4122-1440-7|page=19|quote=...the Medieval Scholastics revived the concept of natural law. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most influential political philosopher of medieval Europe was St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] who helped reintroduce [[Aristotle]]'s works, which had only been transmitted to [[Catholic]] [[Europe]] through [[Muslim]] [[Spain]], along with the commentaries of [[Averroes]]. Aquinas's use of them set the agenda, for [[scholasticism|scholastic]] political philosophy dominated European thought for centuries even unto the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|title=A history of philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y_382o-fpOsC&amp;pg=PA346|volume=3|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-86012-296-8|page=346|quote=There was, however, at least one department of thought ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval political philosophers, such as Aquinas in ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', developed the idea that a king who is a tyrant is no king at all and could be overthrown.

[[Magna Carta]], viewed by many as a cornerstone of Anglo-American political liberty, explicitly proposes the right to revolt against the ruler for justice sake. Other documents similar to Magna Carta are found in other European countries such as Spain and Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Valente|first=Claire|title=The theory and practice of revolt in medieval England|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B8yRrtm0LicC&amp;pg=PA14|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-0901-8|page=14|quote=The two starting points of most medieval discussions ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Renaissance ===
During the [[Renaissance]] secular political philosophy began to emerge after about a century of theological political thought in Europe. While the Middle Ages did see secular politics in practice under the rule of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the academic field was wholly [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] and therefore Christian in nature.

==== Niccolò Machiavelli ====

One of the most influential works during this burgeoning period was [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'', written between 1511–12 and published in 1532, after Machiavelli's death. That work, as well as ''[[Discorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio|The Discourses]]'', a rigorous analysis of the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]], did much to influence modern political thought in the West. A minority (including [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]) interpreted The Prince as a satire meant to be given to the Medici after their recapture of Florence and their subsequent expulsion of Machiavelli from Florence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Ian|title=Lecture on Machiavelli's The Prince|publisher=[[Malaspina University College]]|date=February 2002|url=http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/introser/machiavelli.htm|accessdate=2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile, Machiavelli supported the [[Republic of Florence]] rather than the [[oligarchy]] of the di [[Medici]] family. At any rate, Machiavelli presents a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] and somewhat [[consequentialist]] view of politics, whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end—i.e., the secure and powerful state. [[Thomas Hobbes]], well known for his theory of the [[social contract]], goes on to expand this view at the start of the 17th century during the [[English Renaissance]]. Although neither Machiavelli nor Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings, they both believed in the inherent selfishness of the individual. It was necessarily this belief that led them to adopt a strong central power as the only means of preventing the disintegration of the social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|title=A history of philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y_382o-fpOsC&amp;pg=PA310|volume=3|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-86012-296-8|pages=310–12|quote=...we witness the growth of political absolutism ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Enlightenment ===
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|right|upright=1.45|thumb|Eugène Delacroix's ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830, Louvre), a painting created at a time when old and modern political philosophies came into violent conflict.]]During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period, new theories about what the human was and is and about the definition of reality and the way it was perceived, along with the discovery of other societies in the Americas, and the changing needs of political societies (especially in the wake of the [[English Civil War]], the [[American Revolution]], the [[French Revolution]]), and the [[Haitian Revolution]] led to new questions and insights by such thinkers as [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[Montesquieu]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].

These theorists were driven by two basic questions: one, by what right or need do people form states; and two, what the best form for a state could be. These fundamental questions involved a conceptual distinction between the concepts of "state" and "government." It was decided that "state" would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justified. The term "government" would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound. This conceptual distinction continues to operate in [[political science]], although some political scientists, philosophers, [[history|historians]] and [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state, and that there are societies that are not organized into states that nevertheless must be considered in political terms. As long as the concept of [[natural order (philosophy)|natural order]] was not introduced, the [[social sciences]] could not evolve independently of [[theistic]] thinking. Since the cultural revolution of the 17th century in England, which spread to France and the rest of Europe, society has been considered subject to natural laws akin to the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barens|first1=Ingo|last2=Caspari|first2=Volker|last3=Schefold|first3=Bertram|editor1-last=Barens|editor1-first=Ingo|others=Volker Caspari ed., Bertram Schefold ed.|title=Political events and economic ideas|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x6C5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA206|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84542-152-6|pages=206–07|quote=Economic theory as political philosophy: the example of the French Enlightenment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political and economic relations were drastically influenced by these theories as the concept of the [[guild]] was subordinated to the theory of [[free trade]], and [[Roman Catholic]] dominance of theology was increasingly challenged by [[Protestant]] churches subordinate to each [[nation-state]], which also (in a fashion the Roman Catholic Church often decried angrily) preached in the vulgar or native language of each region. However, the enlightenment was an outright attack on religion, particularly Christianity. The most outspoken critic of the church in France was [[François Marie Arouet de Voltaire]], a representative figure of the enlightenment. After Voltaire, religion would never be the same again in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrne|first=James M.|title=Religion and the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FcEy8SF63TgC&amp;pg=PA1|year=1997|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-25760-6|pages=1–2|quote=... there emerged groups of freethinkers intent on grounding knowledge on the exercise of critical reason, as opposed to ... established religion ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ottoman Empire]], these ideological reforms did not take place and these views did not integrate into common thought until much later. As well, there was no spread of this doctrine within the [[New World]] and the advanced civilizations of the [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Inca]], [[Mohican]], [[Delaware]], [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and especially the [[Iroquois]]. The [[Iroquois]] philosophy in particular gave much to Christian thought of the time and in many cases actually inspired some of the institutions adopted in the [[United States]]: for example, [[Benjamin Franklin]] was a great admirer of some of the methods of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], and much of early American literature emphasized the political philosophy of the natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johansen|first=Bruce Elliott|title=Native American political systems and the evolution of democracy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H593mgxQNu4C&amp;pg=PA69|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30010-3|page=69|quote=... the three-tier system of federalism ... is an inheritance of Iroquois inspiration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== John Locke ====

[[John Locke]] in particular exemplified this new age of political theory with his work ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. In it Locke proposes a state of nature theory that directly complements his conception of how political development occurs and how it can be founded through contractual obligation. Locke stood to refute Sir [[Robert Filmer]]'s paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system. The theory of the [[divine right of kings]] became a passing fancy, exposed to the type of ridicule with which John Locke treated it. Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas, Locke would accept Aristotle's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal. Unlike Aquinas's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from [[original sin]], Locke believes man's mind comes into this world as [[tabula rasa]]. For Locke, knowledge is neither innate, revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason, tolerance and moderation. According to Locke, an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary, for natural law is based on reason and seeking peace and survival for man.

=== Industrialization and the Modern Era ===
The [[Karl Marx|Marxist]] critique of capitalism—developed with [[Friedrich Engels]]—was, alongside liberalism and fascism, one of the defining ideological movements of the twentieth century. The [[industrial revolution]] produced a parallel revolution in political thought. [[Urbanization]] and [[capitalism]] greatly reshaped society. During this same period, the [[History of Socialism|socialist movement]] began to form. In the mid-19th century, [[Marxism]] was developed, and [[socialism]] in general gained increasing popular support, mostly from the urban working class. Without breaking entirely from the past, Marx established principles that would be used by future revolutionaries of the 20th century namely [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Ho Chi Minh]], and [[Fidel Castro]]. Though [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s philosophy of history is similar to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s, and [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of revolution towards the common good is partly based on Kant's view of history—Marx declared that he was turning Hegel's dialectic, which was "standing on its head", "the right side up again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/p3.htm|title=Capital Volume One, Afterword to the Second German Edition|last=Marx|first=Karl|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Marx who believed in [[historical materialism]], Hegel believed in the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kain|first=Philip J.|title=Marx and modern political theory|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kvG8DVBeT9QC&amp;pg=PA1|year=1993|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-7866-2|pages=1–4|quote=Some of his texts, especially the ''Communist Manifesto'' made him seem like a sort of communist Descartes ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th century, [[socialism]] and [[trade union]]s were established members of the political landscape. In addition, the various branches of [[anarchism]], with thinkers such as [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] or [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[syndicalism]] also gained some prominence. In the Anglo-American world, [[anti-imperialism]] and [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] began gaining currency at the turn of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|reason=Pluralism possibly earlier|date=April 2017}}

[[World War I]] was a watershed event in human history, changing views of governments and politics. The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] (and similar, albeit less successful, revolutions in many other European countries) brought [[communism]]—and in particular the political theory of [[Leninism]], but also on a smaller level [[Luxemburgism]] (gradually)—on the world stage. At the same time, [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties won elections and formed governments for the first time, often as a result of the introduction of [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aspalter|first=Christian|title=Importance of Christian and Social Democratic movements in welfare politics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vouKut-RAYoC&amp;pg=PA70|year=2001|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=978-1-56072-975-4|page=70|quote=The pressing need for universal suffrage ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary ==
From the end of [[World War II]] until 1971, when [[John Rawls]] published ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', political philosophy declined in the Anglo-American academic world, as analytic philosophers expressed skepticism about the possibility that normative judgments had cognitive content, and political science turned toward statistical methods and [[behavioralism]]. In continental Europe, on the other hand, the postwar decades saw a huge blossoming of political philosophy, with [[Marxism]] dominating the field. This was the time of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Louis Althusser]], and the victories of [[Mao Zedong]] in [[China]] and [[Fidel Castro]] in [[Cuba]], as well as the events of [[May 1968]] led to increased interest in revolutionary ideology, especially by the [[New Left]]. A number of continental European émigrés to Britain and the United States—including [[Karl Popper]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Eric Voegelin]] and [[Judith Shklar]]—encouraged continued study in political philosophy in the Anglo-American world, but in the 1950s and 1960s they and their students remained at odds with the analytic establishment.

[[Communism]] remained an important focus especially during the 1950s and 1960s. [[Colonialism]] and [[racism]] were important issues that arose. In general, there was a marked trend towards a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] approach to political issues, rather than a philosophical one. Much academic debate regarded one or both of two pragmatic topics: how (or whether) to apply [[utilitarianism]] to problems of political policy, or how (or whether) to apply economic models (such as [[rational choice theory]]) to political issues. The rise of [[feminism]], [[LGBT social movements]] and the end of colonial rule and of the political exclusion of such minorities as [[African Americans]] and sexual minorities in the developed world has led to feminist, [[postcolonial]], and [[multicultural]] thought becoming significant. This led to a challenge to the [[social contract]] by philosophers [[Charles W. Mills]] in his book ''[[The Racial Contract]]'' and [[Carole Pateman]] in her book ''[[The Sexual Contract]]'' that the social contract excluded persons of colour and women respectively.

In Anglo-American academic political philosophy, the publication of [[John Rawls]]'s ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' in 1971 is considered a milestone. Rawls used a [[thought experiment]], the [[original position]], in which representative parties choose principles of justice for the basic structure of society from behind a veil of ignorance. Rawls also offered a criticism of utilitarian approaches to questions of political justice. [[Robert Nozick]]'s 1974 book ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', which won a [[National Book Award]], responded to Rawls from a [[libertarianism|libertarian]] perspective and gained academic respectability for libertarian viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;David Lewis Schaefer, [http://www.nysun.com/sports/reconsiderations-robert-nozick-and-coast-utopia Robert Nozick and the Coast of Utopia], [[The New York Sun]], April 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporaneously with the rise of analytic ethics in Anglo-American thought, in Europe several new lines of philosophy directed at critique of existing societies arose between the 1950s and 1980s. Most of these took elements of Marxist economic analysis, but combined them with a more cultural or ideological emphasis. Out of the [[Frankfurt School]], thinkers like [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]] combined Marxian and Freudian perspectives. Along somewhat different lines, a number of other continental thinkers—still largely influenced by Marxism—put new emphases on [[structuralism]] and on a "return to [[Hegel]]". Within the (post-) structuralist line (though mostly not taking that label) are thinkers such as [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Claude Lefort]], and [[Jean Baudrillard]]. The [[Situationist International|Situationists]] were more influenced by Hegel; [[Guy Debord]], in particular, moved a Marxist analysis of [[commodity fetishism]] to the realm of consumption, and looked at the relation between consumerism and dominant ideology formation.

Another debate developed around the (distinct) criticisms of liberal political theory made by [[Michael Walzer]], [[Michael Sandel]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. The [[Liberalism|liberal]]-[[communitarian]] debate is often considered valuable for generating a new set of philosophical problems, rather than a profound and illuminating clash of perspective.These and other communitarians (such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and [[Daniel A. Bell]]) argue that, contra liberalism, communities are prior to individuals and therefore should be the center of political focus. Communitarians tend to support greater local control as well as economic and social policies which encourage the growth of [[social capital]].

A pair of overlapping political perspectives arising toward the end of the 20th century are [[republicanism]] (or neo- or civic-republicanism) and the [[capability approach]]. The resurgent republican movement aims to provide an alternate definition of liberty from [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s positive and negative forms of liberty, namely "liberty as non-domination." Unlike the American liberal movement which understands liberty as "non-interference," "non-domination" entails individuals not being subject to the arbitrary will of any other person. To a liberal, a slave who is not interfered with may be free, yet to a republican the mere status as a slave, regardless of how that slave is treated, is objectionable. Prominent republicans include historian [[Quentin Skinner]], jurist [[Cass Sunstein]], and political philosopher [[Philip Pettit]]. The capability approach, pioneered by economists [[Mahbub ul Haq]] and [[Amartya Sen]] and further developed by legal scholar [[Martha Nussbaum]], understands freedom under allied lines: the real-world ability to act. Both the capability approach and republicanism treat choice as something which must be resourced. In other words, it is not enough to be legally able to do something, but to have the real option of doing it.

Current emphasis on "commoditization of the everyday" has been decried by many contemporary theorists, some of them arguing the full brunt of it would be felt in ten years' time. "Pricing" such ethical categories like personal relations or sex, though always present, pushed by media agenda, is thus seen as crossing boundaries and having adverse societal and philosophical consequences.

A prominent subject in recent political philosophy is the theory of [[deliberative democracy]]. The seminal work was done by Jurgen Habermas in [[Germany]], but the most extensive literature has been in English, led by theorists such as [[Jane Mansbridge]], Joshua Cohen, Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson.&lt;ref&gt;Gutmann, Amy, and Dennis Thompson, ''Democracy and Disagreement'' (Princeton University Press, 1996). Also see Gutmann and Thompson, ''Why Deliberative Democracy?'' (Princeton University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influential political philosophers ==
A larger [[list of political philosophers]] is intended to be closer to exhaustive. Listed below are some of the most [[Archetype|canonical]] or important thinkers, and especially philosophers whose central focus was in political philosophy and/or who are good representatives of a particular school of thought.
* [[Thomas Aquinas]]: In synthesizing Christian theology and Peripatetic (Aristotelian) teaching in his ''[[Treatise on Law]]'', Aquinas contends that God's gift of higher reason—manifest in human law by way of the divine virtues—gives way to the assembly of righteous government.
* [[Aristotle]]: Wrote his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' as an extension of his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''. Notable for the theories that humans are social animals, and that the [[polis]] (Ancient Greek city state) existed to bring about the good life appropriate to such animals. His political theory is based upon an ethics of [[perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionism]] (as is [[Marx]]'s, on some readings).
* [[Mikhail Bakunin]]: After [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], Bakunin became the most important political philosopher of [[anarchism]]. His specific version of anarchism is called [[collectivist anarchism]].
* [[Jeremy Bentham]]: The first thinker to analyze social justice in terms of maximization of aggregate individual benefits. Founded the philosophical/ethical school of thought known as [[utilitarianism]].
* [[Isaiah Berlin]]: Developed the distinction between positive and negative liberty.
* [[Edmund Burke]]: Irish member of the British parliament, Burke is credited with the creation of conservative thought. Burke's ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' is the most popular of his writings where he denounced the French revolution. Burke was one of the biggest supporters of the American Revolution.
* [[Confucius]]: The first thinker to relate ethics to the political order.
* [[William E. Connolly]]: Helped introduce postmodern philosophy into political theory, and promoted new theories of [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|Pluralism]] and [[agonistic democracy]].
* [[John Dewey]]: Co-founder of [[pragmatism]] and analyzed the essential role of education in the maintenance of democratic government.
* [[Han Feizi]]: The major figure of the Chinese Fajia ([[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]]) school, advocated government that adhered to laws and a strict method of administration.
* [[Michel Foucault]]: Critiqued the modern conception of power on the basis of the [[prison–industrial complex|prison complex]] and other prohibitive institutions, such as those that designate sexuality, madness and knowledge as the roots of their infrastructure, a critique that demonstrated that subjection is the power formation of subjects in any linguistic forum and that revolution cannot just be thought as the reversal of power between classes.
* [[Antonio Gramsci]]: Instigated the concept of ''[[hegemony]]''. Argued that the [[Sovereign state|state]] and the ruling class uses [[culture]] and [[ideology]] to gain the consent of the classes it rules over.
* [[Thomas Hill Green]]: Modern liberal thinker and early supporter of [[positive freedom]].
* [[Jürgen Habermas]]: Contemporary democratic theorist and sociologist. He has pioneered such concepts as the [[public sphere]], [[communicative action]], and [[deliberative democracy]]. His early work was heavily influenced by the [[Frankfurt School]].
* [[Friedrich Hayek]]: He argued that central planning was inefficient because members of central bodies could not know enough to match the preferences of consumers and workers with existing conditions. Hayek further argued that [[command economy|central economic planning]]—a mainstay of socialism—would lead to a "total" state with dangerous power. He advocated [[free-market]] capitalism in which the main role of the state is to maintain the [[rule of law]] and let spontaneous order develop.
* [[G. W. F. Hegel]]: Emphasized the "cunning" of history, arguing that it followed a rational trajectory, even while embodying seemingly irrational forces; influenced Marx, [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Michael Oakeshott|Oakeshott]].
* [[Thomas Hobbes]]: Generally considered to have first articulated how the concept of a [[social contract]] that justifies the actions of rulers (even where contrary to the individual desires of governed citizens), can be reconciled with a conception of sovereignty.
* [[David Hume]]: Hume criticized the social contract theory of John Locke and others as resting on a myth of some actual agreement. Hume was a realist in recognizing the role of force to forge the existence of states and that [[consent of the governed]] was merely hypothetical. He also introduced the concept of [[utility]], later picked up on and developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]].
* [[Thomas Jefferson]]: Politician and political theorist during the [[American Enlightenment]]. Expanded on the philosophy of Thomas Paine by instrumenting [[republicanism]] in the United States. Most famous for the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].
* [[Immanuel Kant]]: Argued that participation in civil society is undertaken not for self-preservation, as per [[Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]], but as a moral duty. First modern thinker who fully analyzed structure and meaning of obligation. Argued that an international organization was needed to preserve world peace.
* [[Peter Kropotkin]]: One of the classic anarchist thinkers and the most influential theorist of [[anarcho-communism]].
* [[John Locke]]: Like Hobbes, described a social contract theory based on citizens' fundamental rights in the [[state of nature]]. He departed from Hobbes in that, based on the assumption of a society in which moral values are independent of governmental authority and widely shared, he argued for a government with power limited to the protection of personal property. His arguments may have been deeply influential to the formation of the [[United States Constitution]].
* [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]: First systematic analyses of: (1) how consent of a populace is negotiated between and among rulers rather than simply a naturalistic (or theological) given of the structure of society; (2) precursor to the concept of ideology in articulating the epistemological structure of commands and law.
* [[James Madison]]: American politician and protege of Jefferson considered to be "Father of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]" and "Father of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]" of the United States. As a political theorist, he believed in [[separation of powers]] and proposed a comprehensive set of [[Separation of powers#Checks_and_balances|checks and balances]] that are necessary to protect the rights of an individual from the [[tyranny of the majority]].
* [[Herbert Marcuse]]: Called the father of the [[new left]]. One of the principal thinkers within the [[Frankfurt School]], and generally important in efforts to fuse the thought of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Karl Marx]]. Introduced the concept of "[[repressive desublimation]]", in which social control can operate not only by direct control, but also by manipulation of desire. His work [[Eros and Civilization]] and notion of a non-repressive society was influential on the 1960s and its counter-cultural social movements.
* [[Karl Marx]]: In large part, added the historical dimension to an understanding of society, culture and economics. Created the concept of ''ideology'' in the sense of (true or false) beliefs that shape and control social actions. Analyzed the fundamental nature of class as a mechanism of governance and social interaction. Profoundly influenced world politics with his theory of communism.
* [[Mencius]]: One of the most important thinkers in the Confucian school, he is the first theorist to make a coherent argument for an obligation of rulers to the ruled.
* [[John Stuart Mill]]: A [[utilitarian]], and the person who named the system; he goes further than Bentham by laying the foundation for liberal democratic thought in general and modern, as opposed to classical, liberalism in particular. Articulated the place of individual liberty in an otherwise utilitarian framework.
* [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]]: Analyzed protection of the people by a "balance of powers" in the divisions of a state.
* [[John Rawls]]: Revitalized the study of normative political philosophy in Anglo-American universities with his 1971 book [[A Theory of Justice]], which uses a version of [[social contract theory]] to answer fundamental questions about [[justice]] and to criticise [[utilitarianism]].
* [[Mozi]]: Eponymous founder of the Mohist school, advocated a form of [[Mohist consequentialism|consequentialism]].
* [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]: Philosopher who became a powerful influence on a broad spectrum of 20th-century political currents in [[Marxism]], [[anarchism]], [[fascism]], [[socialism]], [[libertarianism]], and [[conservatism]]. His interpreters have debated the content of his political philosophy.
* [[Robert Nozick]]: Criticized Rawls, and argued for [[libertarianism]], by appeal to a hypothetical history of the [[State (polity)|state]] and of [[property]].
* [[Thomas Paine]]: [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writer who defended [[liberal democracy]], the [[American Revolution]], and [[French Revolution]] in ''[[Common Sense]]'' and The ''[[Rights of Man]]''.
* [[Plato]]: Wrote a lengthy dialog ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' in which he laid out his political philosophy: citizens should be divided into three categories. One category of people are the rulers: they should be philosophers, according to Plato, this idea is based on his [[Theory of Forms]].
* [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]: Commonly considered the father of modern [[anarchism]], specifically [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].
* [[Ayn Rand]]: Founder of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and prime mover of the Objectivist and Libertarian movements in mid-twentieth-century America. Advocated a complete, laissez-faire capitalism. Rand held that the proper role of government was exclusively the protection of individual rights without economic interference. The government was to be separated from economics the same way and for the same reasons it was separated from religion. Any governmental action not directed at the defense of individual rights would constitute the initiation of force (or threat of force), and therefore a violation not only of rights but also of the legitimate function of government.
* [[Murray Rothbard]]: The central theorist of [[anarcho-capitalism]] and an [[Austrian School]] economist.
* [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]: Analyzed the social contract as an expression of the [[general will]], and controversially argued in favor of absolute [[democracy]] where the people at large would act as [[Sovereignty|sovereign]].
* [[Carl Schmitt]]: German political theorist, tied to the Nazis, who developed the concepts of the Friend/Enemy Distinction and the State of exception. Though his most influential books were written in the 1920s, he continued to write prolifically until his death (in academic quasi-exile) in 1985. He heavily influenced 20th-century political philosophy both within the Frankfurt School and among others, not all of whom are philosophers, such as [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Hannah Arendt]], and [[Giorgio Agamben]].
* [[Adam Smith]]: Often said to have founded modern [[economics]]; explained emergence of economic benefits from the self-interested behavior ("the invisible hand") of artisans and traders. While praising its efficiency, Smith also expressed concern about the effects of industrial labor (e.g., repetitive activity) on workers. His work on moral sentiments sought to explain social bonds which enhance economic activity.
* [[Socrates]]: Widely considered the founder of Western political philosophy, via his spoken influence on Athenian contemporaries; since Socrates never wrote anything, much of what we know about him and his teachings comes through his most famous student, Plato.
* [[Baruch Spinoza]]: Set forth the first analysis of ''[[rational egoism]]'', in which the rational interest of self is conformance with pure reason. To Spinoza's thinking, in a society in which each individual is guided by reason, political authority would be superfluous.
* [[Max Stirner]]: Important thinker within [[anarchism]] and the main representative of the anarchist current known as [[individualist anarchism]].
* [[Leo Strauss]]: Famously rejected modernity, mostly on the grounds of what he perceived to be modern political philosophy's excessive self-sufficiency of reason and flawed philosophical grounds for moral and political normativity. He argued instead we should return to pre-modern thinkers for answers to contemporary issues. His philosophy was influential on the formation of [[Neo-Conservativism]], and a number of his students later were members of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]].
* [[Henry David Thoreau]]: Influential American thinker on such diverse later political positions and topics such as [[pacifism]], [[anarchism]], [[environmentalism]] and [[civil disobedience]] who influenced later important political activists such as [[Martin Luther King]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]].
* [[Voltaire|François-Marie Arouet (Voltaire)]]: French Enlightenment writer, poet, and philosopher famous for his advocacy of civil liberties, including freedom of religion and free trade.
* [[Bernard Williams]]: A British moral philosopher whose posthumously published work on political philosophy ''In the Beginning was the Deed'' has been seen—along with the works of [[Raymond Geuss]]—as a key foundational work on political realism.
* [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]: A French political scientist and diplomat, known for his works ''[[Democracy in America]]'' and ''[[The Old Regime and the Revolution]]''.

'''Pollutant-induced abnormal behaviour''' refers to the [[abnormal behaviour]] induced by [[pollutant]]s. Chemicals released into the natural environment by humans impact the behaviour of a wide variety of animals. The main culprits are [[Endocrine disruptor|endocrine-disrupting chemicals]] (EDCs), which mimic, block, or interfere with animal hormones. A new research field, integrative behavioural ecotoxicology, is emerging.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Elizabeth K.|last2=Buchwalter|first2=David B.|last3=Kerby|first3=Jacob L.|last4=LeFauve|first4=Matthew K.|last5=Varian-Ramos|first5=Claire W.|last6=Swaddle|first6=John P.|date=2017-04-01|title=Integrative behavioral ecotoxicology: bringing together fields to establish new insight to behavioral ecology, toxicology, and conservation|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/cz/zox010|journal=Current Zoology|language=en|volume=63|issue=2|pages=185–194|doi=10.1093/cz/zox010|issn=1674-5507}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, chemical pollutants are not the only anthropogenic offenders. Noise and light pollution also induce abnormal behaviour. 

This topic is of special concern for its conservation and human health implications and has been studied greatly by animal behaviourists, environmental toxicologists, and conservation scientists. Behaviours serve as potential indicators for ecological health. Behaviour can be more sensitive to EDCs than developmental and physiological traits, and it was the behaviour of eagles that first drew attention to the now well-known dangers of DDT.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zala|first=Sarah M.|last2=Penn|first2=Dustin J.|date=2004|title=Abnormal behaviours induced by chemical pollution: a review of the evidence and new challenges|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347204001782|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=68|issue=4|pages=649–664|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.01.005|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, behaviour is generally difficult to measure and can be highly variable.

Behaviours which are critical for survival, such as reproductive and social behaviours, and cognitive abilities like learning can be affected directly or indirectly by chemical pollutants— many examples have been documented, and their chemical culprits have been identified. These same behaviours can also be altered by anthropogenic noise and light, although their mechanisms are relatively unknown.

== EDCs known to alter behaviour&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==
* [[Atrazine]] (pesticide)
* [[Bisphenol A]]
* [[Carbaryl]]
* [[Cypermethrin]]
* [[DDT]]
* [[Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate|DEHP]]
* [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|Dioxin]]
* [[Endosulfan]]
* [[Fenarimol]]
* [[Fenitrothion]]
* [[Kepone]]
* [[Lead]]
* [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]
* [[Methoxychlor]]
* [[Nonylphenol]]
* [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]]
* [[Vinclozolin]]
* [[Trenbolone|17β-trenbolone]] (agricultural pollutant)

Determining the link between such pollutants and altered behaviours often requires both field studies and laboratory studies. Field studies are useful in determining whether behavioural changes appear with pollution levels occurring in the environment, while laboratory studies can be used to clarify the mechanisms connecting an environmental pollutant to specific behavioural changes.

== Mechanisms&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==
EDCs affect the synthesis, storage, release, transport, clearance, receptor recognition, binding, or post-receptor responses of hormones. This results in either stimulative or inhibitive effects, resulting in overproduction or underproduction of hormones. The effects of hormones on behaviour have been well studied, and often produce direct behavioural effects by acting on the central nervous system. Indirectly, behaviours may be altered by hormones influencing an animal's metabolism or other important processes.

Since behaviours also influence hormones, chemical pollutants that induce behavioural changes may also affect hormone levels, which could result in more behavioural or other changes.

== Applying Tinbergen’s four questions&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ==

Studies into the mechanisms underlying behavioural adjustments fall into a category of animal behaviour research described by Tinbergen.

Studies of animal behaviour typically pertain to one of [[Tinbergen's four questions|Tinbergen’s four questions]], and these can be applied to studies regarding chemical pollution. Questions of causation focus on how pollutant-exposure disrupts the mechanisms behind normal behaviour. For example, when differences in sexual behaviours were noted in wildlife after the introduction of DDT, biochemical experiments on rats were able to show that the pollutant was inhibiting androgen binding to androgen receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scott|first=Graham R|last2=Sloman|first2=Katherine A|date=2004|title=The effects of environmental pollutants on complex fish behaviour: integrating behavioural and physiological indicators of toxicity|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166445X0400102X|journal=Aquatic Toxicology|volume=68|issue=4|pages=369–392|doi=10.1016/j.aquatox.2004.03.016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Secondly, questions of ontogeny consider how exposure disrupts the development of behaviours. An example is when researchers examined the effects of an aerosol on the spatial learning of mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Win-Shwe|first=Tin-Tin|last2=Kyi-Tha-Thu|first2=Chaw|last3=Moe|first3=Yadanar|last4=Maekawa|first4=Fumihiko|last5=Yanagisawa|first5=Rie|last6=Furuyama|first6=Akiko|last7=Tsukahara|first7=Shinji|last8=Fujitani|first8=Yuji|last9=Hirano|first9=Seishiro|date=2015-06-30|title=Nano-Sized Secondary Organic Aerosol of Diesel Engine Exhaust Origin Impairs Olfactory-Based Spatial Learning Performance in Preweaning Mice|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/5/3/1147|journal=Nanomaterials|language=en|volume=5|issue=3|pages=1147–1162|doi=10.3390/nano5031147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly, questions of adaptation consider how behavioural modifications resulting from exposure will influence fitness. Scientists have investigated the reproductive success of white ibises exposed to Methylmercury, for instance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Lastly, questions of phylogeny consider how phylogenetic history might predetermine sensitivity or resistance to pollutants in a particular behaviour. This could include investigating how animals that are better at learning might be better at avoiding toxins in the environment.

== Effects on reproductive behaviours ==

Reproductive behaviour effects may involve changes in courtship and mating behaviours, mate choice, or changes in nest building.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most studies on this topic have been conducted on fish and birds. For example, treating adult male zebra fish with biphenol A for 7 weeks resulted in decreased courtship behaviour of females.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gore|first=Andrea C.|last2=Holley|first2=Amanda M.|last3=Crews|first3=David|date=2017|title=Mate choice, sexual selection, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2017.09.001|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2017.09.001|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 17β-trenbolone exposure in adult guppies and mosquitofish also altered female mate selection, as they preferred unexposed males.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Guppies treated with atrazine during breeding and through gestation were less likely to engage in and showed fewer numbers of courtship displays and other reproductive behaviours. Additionally, females preferred untreated males.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Studies on birds show significant effects of EDCs on mating songs and displays. For example, treating female zebra finches with PCBs before egg laying resulted in a size reduction in the song centres of the chick’s brains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Methylmercury exposure at environmental levels for 3 years in male white ibises resulted in increased homosexual behaviour, decreased rates of key courtship behaviours, and less attractiveness to females.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frederick|first=Peter|last2=Jayasena|first2=Nilmini|date=2011-06-22|title=Altered pairing behaviour and reproductive success in white ibises exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of methylmercury|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/278/1713/1851|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=278|issue=1713|pages=1851–1857|doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.2189|issn=0962-8452|pmid=21123262|pmc=3097836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mammals are also susceptible, and effects on individuals have been shown to have transgenerational and even population-level consequences. Illustrating this, female rats three generations removed from vinclozolin exposure show changes in mate preference, preferring unexposed mates, while male rats do not, and this could have complex effects on the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crews|first=D.|last2=Gore|first2=A. C.|last3=Hsu|first3=T. S.|last4=Dangleben|first4=N. L.|last5=Spinetta|first5=M.|last6=Schallert|first6=T.|last7=Anway|first7=M. D.|last8=Skinner|first8=M. K.|date=2007|title=Transgenerational epigenetic imprints on mate preference|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/do%20I/10.1073/pnas.0610410104|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=104|issue=14|pages=5942–5946|doi=10.1073/pnas.0610410104|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation implications ==
Chemical-induced changes in animal behaviour often have consequences for wild populations. The effects of concern aren’t limited to reproductive effects, which have obvious implications for population vitality. For example, frogs exposed to pesticide-levels found in the environment demonstrate hyperactivity, whip-like convulsions, and depressed avoidance behaviour, which may increase their vulnerability to predation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

As well, guppies from crude oil-polluted environments are less exploratory after both short-term and long-term exposure. This may weaken their foraging efficiency and resource-use diversity, thus posing a threat to the population viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacquin|first=L.|last2=Dybwad|first2=C.|last3=Rolshausen|first3=G.|last4=Hendry|first4=A. P.|last5=Reader|first5=S. M.|date=2017-01-01|title=Evolutionary and immediate effects of crude-oil pollution: depression of exploratory behaviour across populations of Trinidadian guppies|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-016-1027-9|journal=Animal Cognition|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=97–108|doi=10.1007/s10071-016-1027-9|issn=1435-9448}}&lt;/ref&gt; This topic is therefore quite important for understanding how human-impacts on the environment may threaten populations. Additionally, if abnormal behaviours can be used as indicators of toxic pollution, then this provides a much more accessible mode of toxicology science. Therefore, there is potential for engaging [[Citizen science|citizen scientists]] in environmental research.

== Noise and light pollution ==
[[Pollutant|Pollutants]] are not always chemicals. They can be other unnatural stimuli introduced to the environment by humans, such as noise and light pollution. Anthropogenic noise and light can result in altered antipredator behaviour, reproductive behaviour, communication, foraging behaviour, population distribution, male-male competition and more. However, the mechanisms behind these altered behaviours is relatively unknown within the literature.

=== Noise pollution ===

===== Birds =====
[[File:White-crowned-Sparrow.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:White-crowned-Sparrow.jpg|thumb|Male white-crowned sparrows approach intruders more closely when exposed to noise pollution]]
Noise pollution is widespread, which is mostly a result of transportation networks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barber|first=Jesse R.|last2=Crooks|first2=Kevin R.|last3=Fristrup|first3=Kurt M.|date=March 2010|title=The costs of chronic noise exposure for terrestrial organisms|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534709002614|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=25|issue=3|pages=180–189|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2009.08.002|issn=0169-5347}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Although there are many effects of noise pollution, two specific consequences are adjustments in population distribution and modified animal communication. Birds provide a clear example of both of these consequences. Altered population distributions can affect inter-species interactions. For example, the diversity of birds in the woodlands of New Mexico was significantly reduced in areas with unnatural noise levels&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Francis|first=Clinton D.|last2=Ortega|first2=Catherine P.|last3=Cruz|first3=Alexander|date=August 2009|title=Noise Pollution Changes Avian Communities and Species Interactions|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982209013281|journal=Current Biology|volume=19|issue=16|pages=1415–1419|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.06.052|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This change in diversity resulted in less nest predation, which was explained by the decreased presence of the dominant predator - the scrub-jay. This effect has also been observed in owls. A negative correlation was found between the noise intensity of an area and the probability that a long-eared owl will reside in that region&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fröhlich|first=Arkadiusz|last2=Ciach|first2=Michał|date=2017-10-31|title=Noise shapes the distribution pattern of an acoustic predator|url=https://academic.oup.com/cz/article/64/5/575/4582952|journal=Current Zoology|language=en|volume=64|issue=5|pages=575–583|doi=10.1093/cz/zox061|issn=1674-5507|pmc=6178792|pmid=30323836}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Suggested explanations for this outcome are that hunting efficiency was diminished and communication was less effective.

Noise pollution also affects conspecific communication. High noise levels may require animals to adjust their vocalizations in order for communication to remain effective. Bird songs are a well-studied component of animal communication. The use of adjusted songs was observed in Savannah sparrows residing in noisy environments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curry|first=Claire M.|last2=Des Brisay|first2=Paulson G.|last3=Rosa|first3=Patricia|last4=Koper|first4=Nicola|date=2018-03-02|title=Noise Source and Individual Physiology Mediate Effectiveness of Bird Songs Adjusted to Anthropogenic Noise|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22253-5|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-22253-5|issn=2045-2322|pmc=5834586|pmid=29500452}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Adjusted songs were so distinct that their use in the control environment did not result in responses (i.e. aggressive territorial behaviour) typically observed when non-adjusted songs were vocalized. Failure to recognize conspecific vocalizations can also be detrimental to male-male competition. Male urban white-crowned sparrows approached stimulus songs of intruders more closely, regardless of song type, when in the presence of noise pollution&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Jennifer N.|last2=Derryberry|first2=Elizabeth P.|date=2018-05-14|title=Urban sparrows respond to a sexually selected trait with increased aggression in noise|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25834-6|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-25834-6|issn=2045-2322|pmc=5951809|pmid=29760398}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A higher frequency of harmful fights is a suggested consequence of this behaviour because of the relatively small distance between the intruding and defending males.

==== Marine animals ====
Noise pollution can also affect marine animals. There are many sources of noise in the world's oceans, such as the sounds produced by commercial shipping, sonars and acoustic deterrents&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Marine Mammals and Noise: A Sound Approach to Research and Management|last=|first=|date=2007|work=|access-date=|publisher=Marine Mammal Commission|type=Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Unnatural noise levels can negatively affect reproductive behaviour, such as courtship behaviours. For example, painted goby males did not take part in visual courtship behaviour when in a noisy environment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Jong|first=Karen|last2=Amorim|first2=M. Clara P.|last3=Fonseca|first3=Paulo J.|last4=Fox|first4=Clive J.|last5=Heubel|first5=Katja U.|date=June 2018|title=Noise can affect acoustic communication and subsequent spawning success in fish|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0269749117326064|journal=Environmental Pollution|volume=237|pages=814–823|doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2017.11.003|issn=0269-7491}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Female painted gobies in this experiment were also less likely to spawn in a noisy environment. Noise pollution can also affect foraging behaviour in marine animals, which results in less effective strategies. Porpoises have been found to make fewer prey capture attempts, dive deeper, and cut their foraging behaviour short when a vessel passes by, which results in a higher energy expenditure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wisniewska|first=Danuta Maria|last2=Johnson|first2=Mark|last3=Teilmann|first3=Jonas|last4=Siebert|first4=Ursula|last5=Galatius|first5=Anders|last6=Dietz|first6=Rune|last7=Madsen|first7=Peter Teglberg|date=2018-02-14|title=High rates of vessel noise disrupt foraging in wild harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena)|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/285/1872/20172314|journal=Proc.

Shore crabs were also observed interrupting their foraging behaviour when in the presence of ship noise&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wale|first=Matthew A.|last2=Simpson|first2=Stephen D.|last3=Radford|first3=Andrew N.|date=July 2013|title=Noise negatively affects foraging and antipredator behaviour in shore crabs|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347213001991|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=86|issue=1|pages=111–118|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.05.001|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Antipredator behaviour in marine animals has also been known to change when noise levels are high. Shore crabs took longer to return to their shelters when in the presence of ship noise&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;. ''Neolamprologus pulcher'' (a cichlid fish) females defended their nest less against predators when boat noise was present&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bruintjes|first=Rick|last2=Radford|first2=Andrew N.|date=June 2013|title=Context-dependent impacts of anthropogenic noise on individual and social behaviour in a cooperatively breeding fish|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347213001462|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=85|issue=6|pages=1343–1349|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.03.025|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Recommendations for marine animals ====
Specific mitigation strategies and recommendations have been presented by the Marine Mammal Commission (2007). They offer multiple ways to alleviate noise pollution in the ocean. Some strategies include removing the source of noise, employing sound attenuation devices, limiting the use of the sound source and monitoring operational requirements. They recommend improving research programs, creating consistent regulation standards that are better enforced and improving mitigation strategies.

=== Light pollution ===
Light pollution affects multiple aspects of animal behaviour, such as reproductive behaviour, foraging behaviour and antipredator behaviour. Altered reproductive behaviour has been observed in multiple taxa. Female crickets were less captious of males when they were raised in bright artificial light&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Botha|first=L. Michael|last2=Jones|first2=Therésa M.|last3=Hopkins|first3=Gareth R.|date=July 2017|title=Effects of lifetime exposure to artificial light at night on cricket (Teleogryllus commodus) courtship and mating behaviour|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347217301574|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=129|pages=181–188|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.05.020|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Male crickets that were raised under continuous artificial light were discriminated against more than male crickets raised in darkness or moonlight. Female fireflies also altered their reproductive behaviour by failing to flash when placed under artificial light and males never flashed in response to these females&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Firebaugh|first=Ariel|last2=Haynes|first2=Kyle J.|date=August 2018|title=Light pollution may create demographic traps for nocturnal insects|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S143917911830063X|journal=Basic and Applied Ecology|doi=10.1016/j.baae.2018.07.005|issn=1439-1791}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, it is not only insects that are affected by light pollution. Male green frogs made less calls and moved more often when in the presence of artificial light&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=B.J.|last2=Richardson|first2=J.M.L.|date=October 2006|title=The effect of artificial light on male breeding-season behaviour in green frogs, Rana clamitans melanota|url=https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nrcresearchpress.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1139%2Fz06-142|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|volume=84|issue=10|pages=1528–1532|doi=10.1139/z06-142|issn=0008-4301}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to Baker and Richardson (2006), these behavioural changes negatively affect breeding success.
[[File:Bats flying (9413217529).jpg|thumb|Bats miss optimal foraging time when exposed to light pollution.]]
Another consequence of light pollution is the disruption of foraging behaviour in wildlife, such as where and when they forage or hunt. Beach mice used foraging patches near sodium vapor lights or yellow bug lights less often than non-lit patches and they also harvested fewer seeds from these lit patches&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bird|first=Brittany L.|last2=Branch|first2=Lyn C.|last3=Miller|first3=Deborah L.|date=2004|title=Effects of Coastal Lighting on Foraging Behavior of Beach Mice|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3589011|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=18|pages=1435-1439|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This study also hypothesizes that artificial light may alter the movement of mice because of predation risks. Bats are another animal that are greatly affected by light pollution. The presence of artificial lights is associated with a delayed emergence of bats from their dwellings and less time spent emerged&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boldogh|first=Sándor|last2=Dobrosi|first2=Dénes|last3=Samu|first3=Péter|date=December 2007|title=The effects of the illumination of buildings on house-dwelling bats and its conservation consequences|url=https://www.bioone.org/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bioone.org%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.3161%2F1733-5329%25282007%25299%255B527%253ATEOTIO%255D2.0.CO%253B2|journal=Acta Chiropterologica|language=en-US|volume=9|issue=2|pages=527–534|doi=10.3161/1733-5329(2007)9[527:teotio]2.0.co;2|issn=1508-1109}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This alteration in foraging behaviour causes bats to miss the most optimal hunting time for insects&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;. According to this study, as little as one hour of artificial light exposure after dusk disrupts the bats foraging behaviour, as well as growth rates.

Light pollution can also alter antipredator behaviour in wildlife. When moths come within a close proximity of a hunting bat, they make a powerdive towards the ground&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roeder|first=Kenneth D.|last2=Treat|first2=Asher E.|date=1961|title=The detection and evasion of bats by moths|url=|journal=American Scientist|volume=49|pages=135-148|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Roeder &amp; Treat, 1961). If moths are in the presence of artificial light, they are less likely to make this powerdive manoeuver, which results in a reduced ability to evade bat predation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wakefield|first=Andrew|last2=Stone|first2=Emma L.|last3=Jones|first3=Gareth|last4=Harris|first4=Stephen|date=2015-08-01|title=Light-emitting diode street lights reduce last-ditch evasive manoeuvres by moths to bat echolocation calls|url=http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/2/8/150291|journal=Open Science|language=en|volume=2|issue=8|pages=150291|doi=10.1098/rsos.150291|issn=2054-5703|pmc=4555863|pmid=26361558}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A suggested explanation for this behaviour, according to this study, is that moths turn their ultrasound detection off in daylight (or simulated daylight). Predator-prey interactions are also altered by noise pollution. An example of this is in loggerhead turtles and ghost crabs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silva|first=Elton|last2=Marco|first2=Adolfo|last3=da Graça|first3=Jesemine|last4=Pérez|first4=Héctor|last5=Abella|first5=Elena|last6=Patino-Martinez|first6=Juan|last7=Martins|first7=Samir|last8=Almeida|first8=Corrine|date=August 2017|title=Light pollution affects nesting behavior of loggerhead turtles and predation risk of nests and hatchlings|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1011134417302543|journal=Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology|volume=173|pages=240–249|doi=10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2017.06.006|issn=1011-1344}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Ghost crabs are attracted to artificial lights and begin to exhibit more aggressive predatory behaviour in the presence of the light. This study hypothesizes that loggerhead hatchling predation would also increase as a result of this modified predatory behaviour and the predator-prey relationship would, therefore, be altered.

The '''Systems Biology Markup Language''' ('''SBML''') is a representation format, based on [[XML]], for communicating and storing [[computational model]]s of biological processes.&lt;ref name="springer"/&gt; It is a free and open standard with widespread software support and a community of users and developers. SBML can represent many different classes of [[biological phenomena]], including [[metabolic network]]s, [[cell signaling]] pathways, [[Gene regulatory networks|regulatory networks]], [[infectious disease]]s, and many others.&lt;ref name="pmid12611808" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14641091" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17052114" /&gt; It has been proposed as a standard for representing computational models in systems biology today.&lt;ref name="pmid17052114" /&gt;

== History ==

Late in the year 1999 through early 2000, with funding from the Japan Science and Technology Corporation (JST), [[Hiroaki Kitano]] and [[John C. Doyle]] assembled a small team of researchers to work on developing better software infrastructure for [[computer model|computational modeling]] in [[systems biology]]. Hamid Bolouri was the leader of the development team, which consisted of Andrew Finney, Herbert Sauro, and Michael Hucka.&lt;ref name="History of SBML" /&gt; Bolouri identified the need for a framework to enable interoperability and sharing between the different simulation software systems for biology in existence during the late 1990s, and he organized an informal workshop in December 1999 at the [[California Institute of Technology]] to discuss the matter. In attendance at that workshop were the groups responsible for the development of DBSolve, E-Cell, Gepasi, Jarnac, StochSim and The Virtual Cell. Separately, earlier in 1999, some members of these groups also had discussed the creation of a portable file format for metabolic network models in the BioThermoKinetics (BTK) group.&lt;ref name="bionet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18054049" /&gt; The same groups who attended the first Caltech workshop met again on April 28–29, 2000, at the first of a newly created meeting series called ''Workshop on Software Platforms for Systems Biology''.&lt;ref name="workshop 1" /&gt; It became clear during the second workshop that a ''common model representation format'' was needed to enable the exchange of models between software tools as part of any functioning interoperability framework, and the workshop attendees decided the format should be encoded in [[XML]].

The Caltech ERATO team developed a proposal for this XML-based format and circulated the draft definition to the attendees of the 2nd Workshop on Software Platforms for Systems Biology in August, 2000. This draft underwent extensive discussion over mailing lists and during the 2nd Workshop on Software Platforms for Systems Biology,&lt;ref name="workshop 2" /&gt; held in [[Tokyo]], Japan, in November 2000 as a satellite workshop of the ICSB 2000 conference. After further revisions, discussions and software implementations, the Caltech team issued a specification for SBML Level 1, Version 1 in March, 2001.

SBML Level 2 was conceived at the 5th Workshop on Software Platforms for Systems Biology, held in July 2002, at the [[University of Hertfordshire]], UK.&lt;ref name="workshop 5" /&gt; By this time, far more people were involved than the original group of SBML collaborators and the continued evolution of SBML became a larger community effort, with many new tools having been enhanced to support SBML. The workshop participants in 2002 collectively decided to revise the form of SBML in Level&amp;nbsp;2. The first draft of the Level&amp;nbsp;2 Version&amp;nbsp;1 specification was released in August 2002, and the final set of features was finalized in May 2003 at the 7th Workshop on Software Platforms for Systems Biology in [[Ft.&amp;nbsp;Lauderdale]], Florida.

The next iteration of SBML took two years in part because software developers requested time to absorb and understand the larger and more complex SBML Level&amp;nbsp;2. The inevitable discovery of limitations and errors led to the development of SBML Level&amp;nbsp;2 Version&amp;nbsp;2, issued in September 2006. By this time, the team of SBML Editors (who reconcile proposals for changes and write a coherent final specification document) had changed and now consisted of Andrew Finney, Michael Hucka and Nicolas Le&amp;nbsp;Novère.

SBML Level&amp;nbsp;2 Version&amp;nbsp;3 was published in 2007 after countless contributions by and discussions with the SBML community. 2007 also saw the election of two more SBML Editors as part of the introduction of the modern SBML Editor organization in the context of the SBML development process.

SBML Level&amp;nbsp;2 Version&amp;nbsp;4 was published in 2008 after certain changes in Level&amp;nbsp;2 were requested by popular demand. (For example, an electronic vote by the SBML community in late 2007 indicated a majority preferred not to require strict unit consistency before an SBML model is considered valid.) Version&amp;nbsp;4 was finalized after the SBML Forum meeting held in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden, as a satellite workshop of ICSB 2008 in the fall of 2008.&lt;ref name="forum 13" /&gt;

SBML Level 3 Version 1 Core was published in final form in 2010, after prolonged discussion and revision by the SBML Editors and the SBML community. It contains numerous significant changes in syntax and constructs from Level&amp;nbsp;2 Version&amp;nbsp;4, but also represents a new modular base for continued expansion of SBML's features and capabilities going into the future.

SBML Level&amp;nbsp;2 Version&amp;nbsp;5 was published in 2015. This revision included a number of textual (but not structural) changes in response to user feedback, thereby addressing the list of errata collected over many years for the SBML Level&amp;nbsp;2 Version&amp;nbsp;4 specification. In addition, Version&amp;nbsp;5 introduced a facility to use nested annotations within SBML's annotation format (an annotation format that is based on a subset of [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]).

== The language ==

SBML is sometimes incorrectly assumed to be limited in scope only to biochemical network models because the original publications and early software focused on this domain. In reality, although the central features of SBML are indeed oriented towards representing chemical reaction-like processes that act on entities, this same formalism serves analogously for many other types of processes; moreover, SBML has language features supporting the direct expression of mathematical formulas and discontinuous events separate from reaction processes, allowing SBML to represent much more than solely biochemical reactions. Evidence for SBML's ability to be used for more than merely descriptions of biochemistry can be seen in the variety of models available from [[BioModels Database]].

=== Purposes ===

SBML has three main purposes:

* enable the use of multiple software tools without having to rewrite models to conform to every tool's idiosyncratic file format;
* enable models to be shared and published in a form that other researchers can use even when working with different software environments;
* ensure the survival of models beyond the lifetime of the software used to create them.

SBML is not an attempt to define a universal language for quantitative models. SBML's purpose is to serve as a ''[[lingua franca]]''—an exchange format used by different present-day software tools to communicate the essential aspects of a computational model.&lt;ref name="nuts and bolts" /&gt;

=== Main capabilities ===

SBML can encode models consisting of entities (called ''species'' in SBML) acted upon by processes (called ''reactions''). An important principle is that models are decomposed into explicitly-labeled constituent elements, the set of which resembles a verbose rendition of chemical reaction equations (if the model uses reactions) together with optional explicit equations (again, if the model uses these); the SBML representation deliberately does not cast the model directly into a set of differential equations or other specific interpretation of the model. This explicit, modeling-framework-agnostic decomposition makes it easier for a software tool to interpret the model and translate the SBML form into whatever internal form the tool actually uses.

A software package can read an SBML model description and translate it into its own internal format for model analysis. For example, a package might provide the ability to simulate the model by constructing differential equations and then perform numerical time integration on the equations to explore the model's dynamic behavior. Or, alternatively, a package might construct a discrete [[stochastic]] representation of the model and use a [[dynamic Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulation method such as the [[Gillespie algorithm]].

SBML allows models of arbitrary complexity to be represented. Each type of component in a model is described using a specific type of data structure that organizes the relevant information. The data structures determine how the resulting model is encoded in XML.

In addition to the elements above, another important feature of SBML is that every entity can have machine-readable annotations attached to it. These annotations can be used to express relationships between the entities in a given model and entities in external resources such as databases. A good example of the value of this is in BioModels Database, where every model is annotated and linked to relevant data resources such as publications, databases of compounds and pathways, controlled vocabularies, and more. With annotations, a model becomes more than simply a rendition of a mathematical construct—it becomes a semantically-enriched framework for communicating knowledge.&lt;ref name="pmid19933161"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biomed2015"/&gt;

=== Levels and versions ===

SBML is defined in '''Levels''': upward-compatible specifications that add features and expressive power. Software tools that do not need or cannot support the complexity of higher Levels can go on using lower Levels; tools that can read higher Levels are assured of also being able to interpret models defined in the lower Levels. Thus new Levels do not supersede previous ones. However, each Level can have multiple Versions within it, and new Versions of a Level '''do''' supersede old Versions of that same Level.

There are currently three Levels of SBML defined. The current Versions within those Levels are the following:

* Level 3 Version 1 Core, for which the final Release 1 specification was issued 6 October 2010
* Level 2 Version 5 Release 1
* Level 1 Version 2

Open-source software infrastructure such as libSBML and JSBML allows developers to support all Levels of SBML their software with a minimum amount of effort.

The SBML Team maintains a public issue tracker where readers may report errors or other issues in the SBML specification documents. Reported issues are eventually put on the list of official errata associated with each specification release. The lists of errata are documented on the [http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications Specifications] page of SBML.org.

=== Level&amp;nbsp;3 packages ===

Development of SBML Level&amp;nbsp;3 has been proceeding in a modular fashion. The ''Core'' specification is a complete format that can be used alone. Additional Level&amp;nbsp;3 packages can be layered on to this core to provide additional, optional features.

==== Hierarchical Model Composition ====

The Hierarchical Model Composition package, known as "''comp''", was released in November 2012. This package provides
the ability to include models as submodels inside another model. The goal is to support the ability
of modelers and software tools to do such things as (1) decompose larger models into smaller ones,
as a way to manage complexity; (2) incorporate multiple instances of a given model within one or more
enclosing models, to avoid literal duplication of repeated elements; and (3) create libraries of reusable,
tested models, much as is done in software development and other engineering fields.  The specification was the culmination
of years of discussion by a wide number of people.

==== Flux Balance Constraints ====

The Flux Balance Constraints package (nicknamed "''fbc''") was first released
in February, 2013.  Import revisions were introduced as part of
Version&amp;nbsp;2,&lt;ref name="sbml-fbc-v2"/&gt; released in September, 2015.  The
"''fbc''" package provides support for constraint based modeling,&lt;ref
name="FBA"/&gt; frequently used to analyze and study biological networks on
both a small and large scale.&lt;ref name="GSR"/&gt; This SBML package makes use of
standard components from the SBML Level&amp;nbsp;3 core specification, including
species and reactions, and extends them with additional attributes and
structures to allow modelers to define such things as flux bounds and
optimization functions.

==== Qualitative Models ====

The Qualitative Models or "''qual''" package for SBML Level&amp;nbsp;3 was
released in May, 2013.  This package supports the representation of models where an
in-depth knowledge of the biochemical reactions and their kinetics is missing
and a qualitative approach must be used.  Examples of phenomena that have
been modeled in this way include gene regulatory networks &lt;ref name="GRN"/&gt;
and signalling pathways,&lt;ref name="signal"/&gt; basing the model structure on
the definition of regulatory or influence graphs. The definition and use of
some components of this class of models differ from the way that species and
reactions are defined and used in ''core'' SBML models. For example,
qualitative models typically associate discrete levels of activities with
entity pools; consequently, the processes involving them cannot be described
as reactions per se, but rather as transitions between states. These systems
can be viewed as reactive systems whose dynamics are represented by means of
state transition graphs (or other Kripke structures &lt;ref name="Kripke"/&gt;) in
which the nodes are the reachable states and the edges are the state
transitions.

==== Layout ====

The SBML ''layout'' package originated as a set of annotation conventions
usable in SBML Level&amp;nbsp;2.  It was introduced at the SBML Forum in
St.&amp;nbsp;Louis in 2004.&lt;ref name="forum 8"/&gt; Ralph Gauges wrote the
specification &lt;ref name="layout-gauges"/&gt; and provided an implementation that
was widely used.  This original definition was reformulated as an SBML
Level&amp;nbsp;3 package, and a specification was formally released in August,
2013.

The SBML Level&amp;nbsp;3 Layout package provides a specification for how to
represent a reaction network in a graphical form.  It is thus better tailored
to the task than the use of an arbitrary drawing or graph.  The SBML
Level&amp;nbsp;3 package only deals with the information necessary to define the
position and other aspects of a graph's layout; the additional details
necessary to complete the graph&amp;mdash;namely, how the visual aspects are meant
to be rendered&amp;mdash; are the purvey of the separate SBML Level&amp;nbsp;3
package called ''Rendering'' (nicknamed "''render''").  As of November 2015, a draft
specification for the "''render''" package is available, but it has not yet been
officially finalized.&lt;ref name="sbml-render"/&gt;

==== Packages under development ====

Development of SBML Level&amp;nbsp;3 packages is being undertaken such that specifications are reviewed and implementations
attempted during the development process. Once a specification is a stable and there are two implementations that support it,
the package is considered accepted.  The packages  detailed above have all reached the accepted stage.
The table below gives a brief summary of packages that are currently in the development phase.

=== Structure ===

A model definition in SBML Levels 2 and 3 consists of lists of one or more of the following components:

* '''Function definition''': A named mathematical function that may be used throughout the rest of a model.
* '''Unit definition''': A named definition of a new unit of measure, or a redefinition of an existing SBML default unit. Named units can be used in the expression of quantities in a model.
* '''Compartment Type''' (only in SBML Level&amp;nbsp;2): A type of location where reacting entities such as chemical substances may be located.
* '''Species type''' (only in SBML Level&amp;nbsp;2): A type of entity that can participate in reactions. Examples of species types include ions such as Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, molecules such as glucose or ATP, binding sites on a protein, and more.
* '''Compartment''': A well-stirred container of a particular type and finite size where species may be located. A model may contain multiple compartments of the same compartment type. Every species in a model must be located in a compartment.
* '''Species''': A pool of entities of the same '''species type''' located in a specific '''compartment'''.
* '''Parameter''': A quantity with a symbolic name. In SBML, the term '''parameter''' is used in a generic sense to refer to named quantities regardless of whether they are constants or variables in a model.
* '''Initial Assignment''': A mathematical expression used to determine the initial conditions of a model. This type of structure can only be used to define how the value of a variable can be calculated from other values and variables at the start of simulated time.
* '''Rule''': A mathematical expression used in combination with the differential equations constructed based on the set of reactions in a model. It can be used to define how a variable's value can be calculated from other variables, or used to define the rate of change of a variable. The set of rules in a model can be used with the reaction rate equations to determine the behavior of the model with respect to time. The set of rules constrains the model for the entire duration of simulated time.
* '''Constraint''': A mathematical expression that defines a constraint on the values of model variables. The constraint applies at all instants of simulated time. The set of constraints in model should not be used to determine the behavior of the model with respect to time.
* '''Reaction''': A statement describing some transformation, transport or binding process that can change the amount of one or more species. For example, a reaction may describe how certain entities (reactants) are transformed into certain other entities (products). Reactions have associated kinetic rate expressions describing how quickly they take place.
* '''Event''': A statement describing an instantaneous, discontinuous change in a set of variables of any type (species concentration, compartment size or parameter value) when a triggering condition is satisfied.

== Community ==

As of September, 2015, more than 280 software systems advertise support for SBML. A current list is available in the form of the [http://sbml.org/SBML_Software_Guide SBML Software Guide], hosted at SBML.org.

SBML has been and continues to be developed by the community of people making software platforms for systems biology, through active email discussion lists and biannual workshops. The meetings are often held in conjunction with other biology conferences, especially the International Conference on Systems Biology (ICSB). The community effort is coordinated by an elected editorial board made up of five members. Each editor is elected for a 3-year non-renewable term.

Tools such as an online model validator as well as [[open-source]] libraries for incorporating SBML into software programmed in the [[C programming language|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Mathematica]], [[MATLAB]] and other languages are developed partly by the SBML Team and partly by the broader SBML community.&lt;ref name="sbml_converter" /&gt;

SBML is an official [[IETF]] [[MIME]] type, specified by &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 3823&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;ref name="RFC3823" /&gt;

'''Scott Sunken Garden''' is a historical landmark in [[Lansing, Michigan]], United States of America.

The outer foundation walls are 51 feet by 79 feet and the center is a 28 feet by 45 feet lawn. There are shorter [[limestone]] walls lining the court with raised flower beds. The west side and east sides have limestone steps leading to a small water pond below the grotto center piece. This foundation of Justice Edward Cahill's home was redesigned after 1930 by a new American immigrant, Nick Kriek. The gardening includes bulbs, annuals, perennials and a list of species introduced to the area by Kriek himself.
The garden has been maintained by the Greater Lansing Garden Club for 3 decades; they restored it after a few decades of neglect by the city.&lt;ref name="The New Citizens Press Sunday: September 26, 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tncp.net/Articles/tabid/1800/articletype/ArticleView/articleID/2475/Default.aspx |title=History of Scott Sunken Garden and Its Restoration &gt; The New Citizens Press &amp;#124; TNCP &amp;#124; Lansing Michigan News &gt; TNCP &amp;#124; Greater Lansing MI News |publisher=tncp.net|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
"Even though the Scott House  itself – the house  that stood just west of the garden near the Jenison House/Scott Center –  that formed the central feature of the property no longer exists, the  garden stands out as a fine example of formal landscape garden design  from the early twentieth century (various dates  of construction from the mid-1920s to 1934-35 have been reported). As  far as I’ve been able to determine from all the recent discussions, the  garden is unique in Lansing as a formal garden that, designed for an  urban residential setting, dates from the early  twentieth century period when landscaped gardens and estates associated  with them reached a height of design perfection, during what has been  called the “Golden Age of American Landscape Design.” The Scott Sunken  Garden, in my mind, possesses additional significance  as a prime achievement of a local Lansing artisan, Nick or Nicolaas  Isaac Willem Kriek. Kriek (1895–1978) was born in the Netherlands and, settling in Lansing in the early 1920s, founded the Cottage Gardens  nursery in 1923. Bill Hicks, Mr. Kriek’s grandson  and today part of the still operating family-owned business, states  that Nick Kriek built the Sunken Garden for Scott, from whom he had  purchased the property on which the Cottage Gardens nursery was  established in 1923. It seems logical to think that Kriek  had a major hand in designing the garden to meet the Scotts’ wishes and  requirements. The garden also possesses importance for its direct  association with an important Lansing citizen, Richard H. Scott, who  owned the property and had the garden created. Marilyn  Lee’s 2010 history of the garden states that Scott came to Lansing in  1898 to work for auto pioneer R. E. Olds and helped organize Olds’ Reo  Motor Car Company and served as president of the company after Olds  retired in 1923."
&lt;ref name="Robert O. Christensen, National Register Coordinator, State Historic Preservation Office, MI State Housing Development Authority" /&gt;
This Scott Sunken Garden foundation is presumed to be the remains of Justice Edward Cahill's Lansing home. He moved to Lansing after serving in the Civil War and went to war serving beside African American soldiers in Michigan's 102nd USCI on a campaign through southern states.

The local chapter of this national garden club has a long history with both the Scott Sunken Garden and the Scott Center. The club met at the Scott Center before it was moved to Scott Park and the Garden Club invested the financing to restoration of this landmark garden through the early 80s. The city actually fell short of original expectations and the Garden Club even paid for a restoration of the lower wall of the Scott Sunken Garden &lt;ref name="The New Citizens Press Sunday: September 26, 2010" /&gt;

==Politics==

The city is in need of widespread upgrades to the Power Grid infrastructure inducing several substations to replace the older Eckert Substation next to the Eckert Power Station. The [[Lansing Board of Water and Light]] (LBWL) and Mayor Virg Bernero have pushed for a large Central Substation with their proposal to destroy a riverside park (Scott Park) and to remove historical integrity of its historical landmark of Scott Sunken Garden.

===LBWL Proposals===

The LBWL had submitted an original proposal to the Lansing Parks and Recreation then amended it during the review by the Lansing Planning Board. These Board's are appointed by the Mayor and their decisions are being reviewed by the Lansing City Council.

===Parkland Advocacy===

The Scott Sunken Garden caretakers of 3 decades, the Greater Lansing Garden Club, has declined the LBWL offer of the new garden wanting the historical garden to remain in tact. Each public board meeting and the public meeting held by Jessica Yorko (as Lansing City Council, 4th Ward Representative) were occupied with citizen advocates. There are multiple community organizations publicly advocating saving Scott Sunken Garden, and its Scott Park; "Preservation Lansing" has advocated this along with a list of other historical concerns in the area; [http://www.facebook.com/scottsunkengarden "Friends of Scott Sunken Garden Park"] is a non-profit advocacy organization instituted for protecting Scott Sunken Garden and its neighboring assets of the People of Lansing.

====Public Petitions====

'''Statistical physics''' is a branch of [[physics]] that uses methods of [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], and particularly the [[Mathematics|mathematical]] tools for dealing with large populations and approximations, in solving physical problems. It can describe a wide variety of fields with an inherently [[stochastic]] nature. Its applications include many problems in the fields of physics, [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[neurology]], and even some social sciences, such as [[sociology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raducha|first=Tomasz|last2=Gubiec|first2=Tomasz|date=2017-04|title=Coevolving complex networks in the model of social interactions|journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications|volume=471|pages=427–435|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2016.12.079|issn=0378-4371|arxiv=1606.03130}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[linguistics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raducha|first=Tomasz|last2=Gubiec|first2=Tomasz|date=2018-04-27|title=Predicting language diversity with complex networks|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=13|issue=4|pages=e0196593|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0196593|issn=1932-6203|pmc=5922521|pmid=29702699}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Its main purpose is to clarify the properties of matter in aggregate, in terms of physical laws governing atomic motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Introduction to Statistical Physics |last = Huang |first = Kerson |publisher= CRC Press| isbn = 978-1-4200-7902-9 |page=15 |edition = 2nd|date = 2009-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, [[statistical mechanics]] develops the [[Phenomenology (particle physics)|phenomenological]] results of [[thermodynamics]] from a probabilistic examination of the underlying microscopic systems. Historically, one of the first topics in physics where statistical methods were applied was the field of [[mechanics]], which is concerned with the motion of particles or objects when subjected to a force.

==Statistical mechanics==
{{Statistical mechanics}}
{{main|Statistical mechanics}}
[[Statistical mechanics]] provides a framework for relating the microscopic properties of individual atoms and molecules to the macroscopic or bulk properties of materials that can be observed in everyday life, therefore explaining [[thermodynamics]] as a natural result of statistics, [[classical mechanics]], and [[quantum mechanics]] at the microscopic level.  Because of this history, the statistical physics is often considered synonymous with statistical mechanics or [[statistical thermodynamics]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;This article presents a broader sense of the definition of statistical physics.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important equations in statistical mechanics (analogous to &lt;math&gt;F=ma&lt;/math&gt; in [[Newton's laws of motion|Newtonian mechanics]], or the [[Schroedinger equation|Schrödinger equation]] in quantum mechanics) is the definition of the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, which is essentially a weighted sum of all possible states &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; available to a system.

: &lt;math&gt;Z = \sum_q \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{E(q)}{k_BT}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]], &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is [[temperature]] and  &lt;math&gt;E(q)&lt;/math&gt; is [[energy]] of state  &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, the probability of a given state, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, occurring is given by

: &lt;math&gt;P(q) = \frac{ {\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{E(q)}{k_BT}}}}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

Here we see that very-high-energy states have little probability of occurring, a result that is consistent with intuition.

A statistical approach can work well in classical systems when the number of [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] (and so the number of variables) is so large that exact solution is not possible, or not really useful. Statistical mechanics can also describe work in [[non-linear dynamics]], [[chaos theory]], [[thermal physics]], [[fluid dynamics]] (particularly at high [[Knudsen number]]s), or [[plasma physics]].

Although some problems in statistical physics can be solved analytically using approximations and expansions, most current research utilizes the large processing power of modern computers to simulate or approximate solutions. A common approach to statistical problems is to use a [[Monte Carlo simulation]] to yield insight into the dynamics of a [[complex system]].

===Quantum statistical mechanics===
[[Quantum statistical mechanics]] is [[statistical mechanics]] applied to [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical systems]]. In quantum mechanics a [[statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|statistical ensemble]] (probability distribution over possible [[quantum state]]s) is described by a [[density matrix|density operator]] ''S'', which is a non-negative, [[self-adjoint]], [[trace-class]] operator of trace 1 on the [[Hilbert space]] ''H'' describing the quantum system.  This can be shown under various [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|mathematical formalisms for quantum mechanics]].  One such formalism is provided by [[quantum logic]].

==Scientists and universities==
A significant contribution (at different times) in development of statistical physics was given by [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], [[J. Willard Gibbs]], [[Marian Smoluchowski]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Enrico Fermi]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[L. Landau]], [[Vladimir Fock]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Nikolay Bogolyubov]], Benjamin Widom, [[Lars Onsager]], Benjamin and Jeremy Chubb (also inventors of the titanium sublimation pump), and others. Statistical physics is studied in the nuclear center at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]]. Also, Pentagon has organized a large department for the study of [[turbulence]] at the [[Princeton University|University of Princeton]]. Work in this area is also being conducted by [[Saclay]] (Paris), [[Max Planck Society|Max Planck Institute]], [[AMOLF|Netherlands Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics]] and other research centers.

==Achievements==
Statistical physics allowed us to explain and quantitatively describe [[superconductivity]], [[superfluidity]], [[turbulence]], collective phenomena in [[solid]]s and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], and the structural features of [[liquid]]. It underlies the modern [[astrophysics]]. It is statistical physics that helped us to create such intensively developing study of [[liquid crystals]] and to construct a theory of [[phase transition]] and [[critical phenomena]]. Many experimental studies of matter are entirely based on the statistical description of a system. These include the scattering of cold [[neutron]]s, [[X-ray]], [[Visible radiation|visible light]], and more.
Statistical physics plays a major role in Physics of Solid State Physics, Materials Science, Nuclear Physics, Astrophysics, Chemistry, Biology and Medicine (e.g. study of the spread of infectious diseases), Information Theory and Technique but also in those areas of technology owing to their development in the evolution of Modern Physics. It still has important applications in theoretical sciences such as Sociology and Linguistics and is useful for researchers in higher education, corporate governance and industry.

'''''Swingtown''''' is an American [[television series]] created by [[Mike Kelley (writer)|Mike Kelley]] as a [[midseason replacement|summer replacement]] series for [[CBS]].  The show was a [[Period piece|period]] and relationship [[Television drama|drama]] about the impact of sexual and social liberation in 1970s American suburban households, with [[story arc]]s involving [[open marriage]]s and [[Group sex#Key party|key parties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Development Update: October 16–20 (Weekly Round-Up) |work=The Futon Critic |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7225 |date=2006-10-20 |accessdate=2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
''Swingtown'' premiered on Thursday June 5, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20080414cbs02 |date=2008-04-14 |title=Breaking News - CBS unveils its 2008 summer schedule |work=The Futon Critic}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the time slot previously occupied by ''[[Without a Trace]]''.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;  The show was also picked up by [[Global Television Network|Global]] in Canada, [[ITV3]] in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/222376 |title=TV lineup launch disrupted |date=June 6, 2007 |accessdate=2007-06-15 |last=Bawden |first=Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TV3 Ireland]] in Ireland, [[Network Ten]] in Australia, [[Rai 4]] in [[Italy]], [[Warner Channel]] in South America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldscreen.com/newscurrent.php?filename=warner073107.htm |work=World Screen |title=Warner Channel Takes CBS Paramount Titles |date=2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Universal Channel]] in Poland, TV 2 in Norway, Channel Four in New Zealand, and [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universalchannel.pl/|title=Universal Channel Poland -|publisher=|accessdate=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After seven episodes of declining ratings,&lt;ref name="bandc"/&gt; CBS moved the show's US airing to Fridays, swapping with ''[[Flashpoint (TV series)|Flashpoint]]'', which had outperformed'' Swingtown'' despite airing in a less favorable time slot.  ''Swingtown's'' first season's finale (ultimately the ''de facto'' series finale) aired on September 5.

Although the show's cancellation was suspected well in advance, it was made official on January 14, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvseriesfinale.com/articles/swingtown-cbs-finally-officially-cancels-the-1970s-tv-show/ |title=''Swingtown'' CBS (Finally) Officially Cancels the 1970s TV Show |publisher=TVSeriesFinale.com |accessdate=2009-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090122042735/http://tvseriesfinale.com/articles/swingtown-cbs-finally-officially-cancels-the-1970s-tv-show/ |archivedate=2009-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/tca-cbs-says-swingtown-not-coming-back-33963|title=TCA: CBS Says Swingtown Not Coming Back| publisher=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]| accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
Set in the summer of 1976, the series begins with the relocation of the Miller family to a more affluent neighborhood in the [[North Shore (Chicago)|North Shore]], a suburban area of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]. Bruce Miller (played by [[Jack Davenport]]) is a futures trader working his way up in the business, married to Susan ([[Molly Parker]]). Susan Miller is a homemaker who got pregnant and married Bruce in high school. The couple have a teenage daughter, Laurie ([[Shanna Collins]]), and a young son Bruce Junior, nicknamed B.J. (Aaron Howles).

Tom and Trina Decker ([[Grant Show]] and [[Lana Parrilla]]) are the Millers' new neighbors. Tom, an airline [[aviator|pilot]], met Trina while she was a [[stewardess]]. The Deckers quickly befriend the Millers, and the Millers just as quickly learn that their new neighbors have an [[open marriage]].  The move strains the Millers' friendship with Roger and Janet Thompson ([[Josh Hopkins]] and [[Miriam Shor]]), their more conservative neighbors and friends from their old neighborhood. They try to maintain their friendship with the Millers, but the Thompsons are appalled when they learn about the Deckers' marital arrangement.  The Thompsons have a son, Rick ([[Nick Benson]]).

Although the show mostly focuses on the three couples, their children's stories are followed too, particularly Laurie, who is attracted to her summer school philosophy teacher ([[Michael Rady]]).  B.J. and Rick's friendship is also tested by the move, and B.J. meets Samantha Saxton ([[Brittany Robertson]]), an enigmatic girl who lives next door to him in his new neighborhood.

==Pre-production==
Producers [[Mike Kelley (writer)|Mike Kelley]] ([[head writer]]) and  [[Alan Poul]] first pitched their idea to [[Home Box Office|HBO]], where Poul, who had worked on ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', had a development deal.   Poul said HBO passed on the opportunity at least in part because it already had ''[[Big Love]]'' in production and ''[[Tell Me You Love Me (TV series)|Tell Me You Love Me]]'' in development.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;  The two next approached [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], but before discussions with that network went anywhere, CBS Entertainment president [[Nina Tassler]] found out about the proposal and within a couple of days, had read the script; she gave the series the [[greenlight]] in May 2007.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |author=Jacques Steinberg |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/arts/television/11stei.html?_r=2 |title=Take My Wife.

==Reception==
The 26 critics included in the show's [[Metacritic]] gave it mixed reviews (a "metascore" of 49).  ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said the series "exhibits rare depth" and includes "plenty of nifty touches, from the pop-song score and ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' fashions to the first-rate cast."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brian Lowry |url=https://variety.com/2008/scene/markets-festivals/swingtown-1200522018/ |title=Review: 'Swingtown' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2008-05-30 |accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said "even skillful performances by its largely unknown cast aren't able to hide the lack of character development and the sense that the people in this series are almost self-parodies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Barry Garron |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/swingtown-125599 |title=Swingtown |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=2008-06-01 |accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Salon (website)|Salon]] called it "stylish and '70s-sexy but also shallow enough to feel like a less funny, hollowed-out combination of ''[[The Wonder Years]]'' and ''Boogie Nights'' &amp;mdash; which is exactly what the show's creators told the ''New York Times'' they were aiming for (without using the words 'less funny' and 'hollowed-out' of course)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Heather Havrilesky |url=http://www.salon.com/ent/tv/iltw/2008/05/25/swingtown/index.html |title=I Like to Watch |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=2008-05-28 |accessdate= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526040104/http://www.salon.com/ent/tv/iltw/2008/05/25/swingtown/index.html |archivedate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Controversy===
The [[American Family Association]] urged members to write letters of complaint to the media,&lt;ref name="war"&gt;{{cite news |work=The News Tribune (Tacoma, WA) |title=War on ''Swingtown'' |first=Cheryl |last=Tucker |page=3 |date=2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Parents Television Council]] followed a failed [[boycott]] attempt with an effort to convince CBS affiliates to preempt the program.&lt;ref name="gray"&gt;{{cite news |work=Philadelphia Daily News |title=Around the channels, from 'Swingtown' to Disney |first=Ellen |last=Gray |date=2008-06-12 |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Procter &amp; Gamble]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/mediaworks/article?article_id=128184|title=Advertisers Don't Party With CBS's Swingers|publisher=|accessdate=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ace Hardware]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onemillionmoms.com/IssueDetail.asp?id=308 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917141903/http://www.onemillionmoms.com/IssueDetail.asp?id=308 |archivedate=2008-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; stopped advertising on the serial.

Lindsay Soll writes that one "producer thinks of sophisticated swingers Tom and Trina (Show and Parilla) in a ‘''[[Great Gatsby]]''-like way,’ calling them 'the shining couple across the street.'  Exactly why we'd get in bed with them--er, the show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lindsay Soll |title=TV on DVD |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |volume=1026 |page=58 |date=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audience interest dwindled as the summer progressed.  After a strong [[pilot episode]], [[#Ratings|the ratings for ''Swingtown'']] got progressively worse, aided{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} by [[Friday night death slot|a mid-season move from Thursdays to Friday]].

According to executive producer [[Alan Poul]], the first season ending was shot with the show's uncertain future in mind:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Michael Ausiello]] |url=http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2008/08/grant-show-to-g.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080903003946/http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2008/08/grant-show-to-g.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-09-03 |title=Exclusive: ''Private Practice'' Paging Grant Show... |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=2008-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The season ends with a [[cliffhanger]], but it's also a completely satisfying ending.  So, if we go forward, there are many new things that are set up to explore. And if we don't go forward, there's no feeling that we've been left with something incomplete.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"[[Phonics]]" emphasizes the [[alphabetic principle]] – the idea that letters represent the sounds of speech, and that there are systematic and predictable relationships between written letters and spoken words, which is specific to the [[alphabetic]] [[writing system]] Children learn letter sounds (b = the first sound in "bat" and "ball") first and then blend them (bl = the first two sounds in "blue") to form words.  Children also learn how to segment and chunk letter sounds together in order to blend them to form words (trap = /t/, /r/, /a/, /p/ or /tr/, /ap/).  

"[[Whole language]]" is a [[Reading education|method of teaching reading]] that emphasizes literature and text comprehension. Students are taught to use critical thinking strategies and to use context to "guess" words that they do not recognize. In the younger grades, children use invented spelling to write their own stories. 

Both instructional methods use elements that are emphasized in the other; the differences between the methods are largely related to what is emphasized and the sequence of skill instruction.

==Phonics==
{{Main|Phonics}}

Phonics is seen to be an improvement  used method of learning the approximate [[phoneme|sounds]] represented by [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s (b=buh) first and then blending them with other sounds (bl=bluh) to decode and encode words in written form. This newer method attempts to eliminate the extraneous "uh" sounds which were unavoidable in the older method. Children also learn strategies to figure out words they don't know. 

Phonics is considered an "analytical" approach where students analyze the letters, letter combinations and syllables in a word; in an effort to "decode" (1) the speech-sounds represented by the letters and (2) the meaning of the text. The advantage of phonics is that, especially for students who come to schools with large English vocabularies, it enables students to decode or "sound-out" a word they have in their speaking vocabulary. 

Phonics proponents led by [[Rudolf Flesch]] in his book ''Why Johnny Can't Read'' attacked the whole word approach because (1) it did not get students into reading children's stories that did not have carefully controlled vocabularies and (2) it theoretically required the students to memorize every word as a whole. 

Phonics advocates focus their efforts on the primary grades and emphasize the importance of students having [[phonemic awareness]], that is an understanding of the alphabetic principle that the spelling of words relates to how they sound when spoken. 

A problem with teaching the reading of English with this analytical approach is that English words do not have a one-to-one speech-sound to symbol relationship. If they did have a one-to-one relationship, reading would be easier.  In general, with a few common exceptions, the [[consonant]]s do have a one-to-one speech-sound to symbol relationship but the [[vowel]]s do not. For instance the letter "a" represents one sound in the word "s'''a'''y", a second sound in "'''a'''t", a third sound in "'''a'''ny", a fourth sound in "'''a'''re", a fifth sound in "'''a'''ll", a sixth sound in "'''a'''bout", a seventh sound in "f'''a'''ther", an eighth sound in "or'''a'''nge", and a ninth sound (silence) in "bre'''a'''d". The speech-sounds are sometimes influenced by (a) the letters surrounding the target vowel, (b) by the sentence containing the word and (c) the stress, or lack thereof, given to the syllable containing the letter. 

Almost any combination of three letters with a central "a" can reasonably be pronounced in a number of different ways. For instance the "a" in "pag" could be pronounced as in "page" (long "a"), "pageant" (short "a"), creepage (short "i") or decoupage (short "o" as in "dot"). It therefore follows that beginning students will have a difficult time picking the appropriate sound when sounding-out words which are not in their speaking vocabularies.

Fortunately, most readers quickly develop a subconscious word sense which helps them fluently pick the right sound based on the structure of the word and how that structure is related to other similar words they know.

Some very common words do not fully follow common phonic patterns, so those words have to be memorized. Some books refer to these words as "[[sight word]]s", but it is probably better to refer to them as "memory words" because some books refer to sight words as those words which are so common they do not have to be analyzed or "sounded-out". It does not seem like a good idea to have "sight-words" mean two different things when "memory-words" is available.

The many [[homonym]]s in English such as ''to'', ''too'', and ''two'' create difficulties for students, even at the university level in regard to spelling. 

'''Drawbacks''': 
*For those who learn to speak by learning the whole sound of a word, phonics is not an ideal form of reading instruction, because these learners do not naturally break words into separate sounds.
*Some phonics programs use low-interest reading material and too many boring worksheets. Those "drawbacks", of course, are not unique to a phonics program.

==Whole language==
{{Main|Whole language}}

'''Whole language''' is a currently controversial approach to teaching reading that is based on constructivist learning theory and ethnographic studies of students in classrooms. With whole language, teachers are expected to provide a literacy rich environment for their students and to combine [[Speech communication|speaking]], [[listening]], [[reading (activity)|reading]], and [[writing]]. Whole language teachers emphasize the meaning of texts over the sounds of letters, and phonics instruction becomes just one component of the whole language classroom. 
Whole language is considered a "[[wikt:top-down|top down]]" approach where the reader constructs a personal meaning for a text based on using their prior knowledge to interpret the meaning of what they are reading.

'''Drawbacks''': 
*Some whole language programs place too little emphasis on word analysis. When that is left out, young readers may guess or skip over words they don't know and some children may not learn how to read.
*Some scholars have estimated that a whole-word memorization approach puts severe limitations on the number of words that children can learn to read.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diane McGuinness|McGuinness, Diane]]. [http://www.rrf.org.uk/newsletter.php?n_ID=95 A Prototype for Teaching the English Alphabet Code] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624011617/http://rrf.org.uk/newsletter.php?n_ID=95 |date=2008-06-24 }} Reading Reform Foundation Newsletter (49) &lt;!--accessed August 5, 2008--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who come from "high literacy" households—where young children are read bedtime stories on a regular basis, there are lots of children's books, and adults read regularly—tend to learn to read well regardless of the teaching approach used. These students tend to enter school with large vocabularies and reading readiness skills (and sometimes they already can read). 

Students from "low literacy" households are not exposed much to reading in their homes and tend to have smaller vocabularies. They may speak non-standard dialects of English such as [[African American Vernacular English]] and can be unmotivated students, especially if they see teachers as enemies trying to change how they speak and act, in other words their language and culture. It can be argued that a standard phonics approach might be unsuccessful for these students. Whole language approaches encourage teachers to find reading material that reflects these students' language and culture. Using culturally relevant material within classrooms may assist to engage these students in their reading. In addition, knowing students and how they learn will assist as topics of interest can be incorporated into their reading material for added motivation.

Publishing basal reading textbooks is a multimillion dollar industry that responds to the demands of purchasers. Two populous states, California and Texas, do statewide adoptions of textbooks, and whatever they want in their textbooks, publishers tend to supply. Currently publishers are including systematic phonics instruction (see [[synthetic phonics]]), more classic and popular children's literature, and whole language activities. This compromise generally goes under the rubric of a "balanced approach" to teaching reading. Advocates of balanced reading instruction should supplement a school's adopted reading program with materials that reflect the experiential background and interests of their students. 

Various approaches to reading presume that students learn differently. The phonics emphasis in reading draws heavily from behaviorist learning theory that is associated with the work of the Harvard psychologist [[B.F. Skinner]] while the whole language emphasis draws from cognitivist learning theory and the work of the Russian psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]]. 

Behaviorist learning theory is based on studies of animal behaviors where animals such as pigeons learned to do tasks when they received rewards and extinguished (stopped) behaviors that were not rewarded or were punished. Most of us can point to things we continue to do because we are rewarded for doing them. Rewards can be the pay we get for jobs we do, desired recognition like "A" grades for doing excellent school work, and praise from our friends when they like what we are doing. Likewise, we can point to things we stopped doing because we were not rewarded or were punished for them. Behaviorist learning theory tends to look at extrinsic rewards like money, grades, and gold stars rather than intrinsic rewards like feeling good about successfully accomplishing a difficult task. 

Cognitivist learning theory is based on the idea that children learn by connecting new knowledge to previously learned knowledge. The term is a building metaphor that includes students using scaffolding to organize new information. If children cannot connect new knowledge to old knowledge in a meaningful way, they may with difficulty memorize it ([[rote learning]]), but they will not have a real understanding of what they are learning. 

Vygotsky identified a '''"[[zone of proximal development]]"''' where children can learn new things that are a little above their current understanding with the help of more knowledgeable peers or adults. This new knowledge is incorporated into their existing knowledge base.

'''''The Rise of the Great Powers''''' is a 12-part Chinese documentary television series produced by [[China Central Television|CCTV]]. It was first broadcast on [[CCTV-2]] from 13 to 24 November 2006.&lt;ref name="Kahn"&gt;Kahn, Joseph, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/09/world/asia/09china.html?ex=1323320400&amp;en=dad26021a6a1aed8&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss "China, shy giant, shows signs of shedding its false modesty."], ''[[New York Times]]'', 9 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It discusses the rise of nine [[great power]]s: [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], the [[Dutch Empire|Netherlands]], the [[British Empire|United Kingdom]], [[French colonial empire|France]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] ([[Soviet Union]]), and the [[American imperialism|United States]].

The documentary "endorses the idea that China should study the experiences of nations and empires it once condemned as aggressors bent on exploitation"&lt;ref name="Kahn"/&gt; and analyses the reasons why the nine nations rose to become great powers, from the Portuguese Empire to American [[hegemony]].&lt;ref name="Kahn"/&gt;  The series was produced by an "elite team of Chinese historians" who also briefed the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]] on the subject."&lt;ref name="Kahn"/&gt;  In the [[Western world|West]] the airing of ''Rise of the Great Powers'' has been seen as a sign that China is becoming increasingly open to discussing its growing international power and influence&amp;mdash;referred to by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] as "[[China's peaceful rise]]."&lt;ref name="Kahn"/&gt;

The [[Media of the People's Republic of China|state-run]] ''[[People's Daily]]'' reported that each of the 12 episodes of ''The Rise of the Great Powers'' ran at the [[prime time]] 9:30 p.m. slot, and each show lasted 50 minutes, totaling 600 minutes.&lt;ref name="PeoplesDaily"&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/200611/26/eng20061126_325264.html "TV docu stimulates more open attitude to history, China, the world." ] ''[[People's Daily]]''. 26 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The program included interviews with noted historians and academics, including [[Paul Kennedy]], who wrote the influential book ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers]]'', and [[Joseph Stiglitz]], who won a [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]].&lt;ref name="PeoplesDaily"/&gt; Political leaders, such as former [[President of France|French president]] [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] and former [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Malaysian prime minister]] [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]], were also interviewed."&lt;ref name="PeoplesDaily"/&gt;

It has been dubbed in English and shown on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] under the title ''Rising of Great Powers''.

==List of episodes==
The original titles of the 12 episodes (in Chinese) are listed as follows, each with an accompanying rough translation in English.

==Reception==
In an interview, former [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Singapore prime minister]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] made references to the series:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't know if you've been seeing this or heard of this series that [the Chinese] produced called The Rise of the Great Nations. It's now on the History Channel. I got our station here to dub it in English and show it. It was quite I would say a bold decision to tell the Chinese people this is the way the European nations, the Russians and Japanese became great. Absolutely no ideology and they had a team of historians, their own historians. To get the program going, they went to each country, interviewed the leaders and historians of those countries.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
You should watch the one on Britain, because I think that gives you an idea of how far they have gone in telling their people this is what made Britain great. I was quite surprised. The theme was [doing away with] the Divine Right of Kings, a Britain that was challenged by the barons who brought the king down to Runnymede and then they had the Magna Charta, and suddenly your "Divine Right" is based on Parliament and [the barons] are in Parliament. That gave the space for the barons to grow and the middle class eventually emerged. When the King got too uppity, Charles I got beheaded.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now this series was produced in a communist state, you know. In other words, if you want to be a great nation, so, if the leader goes against the people's interests, you may have to behead him! They also said that because there was growing confidence between the people and the leaders, the country grew.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is in fact a lesson to support their gradual opening up and their idea of how they can do it without conflict -- the "peaceful rise". They have worked out this scheme, this theory, this doctrine to assure America and the world that they're going to play by the rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=79541|title=Full Transcript: Tom Plate and Jeffrey Cole interview Lee Kuan Yew|publisher=''Asia Media''|first=Tom|last=Plate|date=2007-10-09|accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Broadcast, the BBC and other international media carried a report and analysis. The ''New York Times'' commented that the broadcast of the film means that China is no longer" hypocritical humility ", but encouraging people to discuss the prospects of China's rise.

'''Hong Kong version'''
The Hong Kong version, aired on TVB and chaired by Dina each episode, added Dina's comments before and after the advertisements, though the main content was not subject to much change.

'''Characteristics'''
Dina's comments to an international perspective view of a foreign model of development were not only from the economy-development point of view, but also from a political one. They commented on the situation in China.

In the Guangdong region, commercials covered sensitive topics.

'''Summary of articles'''
The episodes invited John Sham and Liu Ruishao together to discuss China's development path, with reference to the social environment in China, the international situation, and China's rise direction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="80207">{{short description|Analysis of datasets using techniques from topology}}
In [[applied mathematics]], '''topological data analysis''' ('''TDA''') is an approach to the analysis of datasets using techniques from [[topology]]. Extraction of information from datasets that are high-dimensional, incomplete and noisy is generally challenging. TDA provides a general framework to analyze such data in a manner that is insensitive to the particular [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] chosen and provides [[dimensionality reduction]] and robustness to noise. Beyond this, it inherits [[functor]]iality, a fundamental concept of modern mathematics, from its topological nature, which allows it to adapt to new mathematical tools.

The initial motivation is to study the shape of data. TDA has combined [[algebraic topology]] and other tools from pure mathematics to allow mathematically rigorous study of "shape". The main tool is [[persistent homology]], an adaptation of [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] to [[point cloud]] data. Persistent homology has been applied to many types of data across many fields. Moreover, its mathematical foundation is also of theoretical importance. The unique features of TDA make it a promising bridge between topology and geometry.

== Basic theory ==

=== Intuition ===
{{tone}}
The premise underlying TDA is that shape matters. Real data in high dimensions is nearly always sparse, and tends to have relevant low dimensional features. One task of TDA is to provide a precise characterization of this fact. An illustrative example is a simple predator-prey system governed by the [[Lotka–Volterra equations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Topological data analysis|url = http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0266-5611/27/12/120201|journal = Inverse Problems|date = 2011-12-01|volume = 27|issue = 12|doi = 10.1088/0266-5611/27/12/120201|first = Charles|last = Epstein|author1-link=Charles Epstein|first2 = Gunnar|last2 = Carlsson|author2-link=Gunnar Carlsson|first3 = Herbert|last3 = Edelsbrunner|author3-link=Herbert Edelsbrunner|pages=120201|arxiv = 1609.08227|bibcode = 2011InvPr..27a0101E}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can easily observe that the trajectory of the system forms a closed circle in state space. TDA provides tools to detect and quantify such recurrent motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%253A575329&amp;dswid=4297 |url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%253A575329&amp;dswid=4297 |website=www.diva-portal.org |accessdate=2015-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119021029/http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A575329 |archivedate=November 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many algorithms for data analysis, including those used in TDA, require the choice of various parameters. Without prior domain knowledge, the correct collection of parameters for a data set is difficult to choose. The main insight of [[persistent homology]] is that we can use the information obtained from all values of a parameter. Of course this insight alone is easy to make; the hard part is encoding this huge amount of information into an understandable and easy-to-represent form. With TDA, there is a mathematical interpretation when the information is a homology group. In general, the assumption is that features that persist for a wide range of parameters are "true" features. Features persisting for only a narrow range of parameters are presumed to be noise, although the theoretical justification for this is unclear.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Early history ===
Precursors to the full concept of persistent homology appeared gradually over time.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;Edelsbrunner H. Persistent homology: theory and practice[J]. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Patrizio Frosini introduced the size function, which is equivalent to the 0th persistent homology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A distance for similarity classes of submanifolds of a Euclidean space|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0004972700028574|journal = Bulletin of the Australian Mathematical Society|date = 1990-12-01|issn = 1755-1633|pages = 407–415|volume = 42|issue = 03|doi = 10.1017/S0004972700028574|first = Patrizio|last = Frosini}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly a decade later, Vanessa Robins studied the images of homomorphisms induced by inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Robins V. Towards computing homology from finite approximations[C]//Topology proceedings. 1999, 24(1): 503-532.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, shortly thereafter, Edelsbrunner et al. introduced the concept of persistent homology together with an efficient algorithm and its visualization as a persistence diagram.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Topological Persistence and Simplification|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-002-2885-2|journal = Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry|date = 2002-11-01|issn = 0179-5376|pages = 511–533|volume = 28|issue = 4|doi = 10.1007/s00454-002-2885-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlsson et al. reformulated the initial definition and gave an equivalent visualization method called persistence barcodes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Persistence barcodes for shapes|url = http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218654305000761|journal = International Journal of Shape Modeling|date = 2005-12-01|issn = 0218-6543|pages = 149–187|volume = 11|issue = 02|doi = 10.1142/S0218654305000761|first = Gunnar|last = Carlsson|first2 = Afra|last2 = Zomorodian|first3 = Anne|last3 = Collins|first4 = Leonidas J.|last4 = Guibas}}&lt;/ref&gt; interpreting persistence in the language of commutative algebra.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In algebraic topology, the set of critical values of smooth Morse function was canonically partitioned into pairs "birth-death", filtered complexes were classified and the visualization of their invariants, equivalent to persistence diagram and persistence barcodes, was given in 1994 by Barannikov's canonical form&lt;ref name="Barannikov 1994"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Framed Morse complex and its invariants |url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267672645_The_Framed_Morse_complex_and_its_invariants |journal = Advances in Soviet Mathematics  | date = 1994|pages = 93–115|volume = 21|first = Sergey|last = Barannikov}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Concepts ===
Some widely used concepts are introduced below. Note that some definitions may vary from author to author.

A '''[[point cloud]]''' is often defined as a finite set of points in some Euclidean space, but may be taken to be any finite metric space.

The [[Cech complex|'''Čech complex''']] of a point cloud is the [[Nerve of a covering|''nerve'' of the ''cover'']] of balls of a fixed radius around each point in the cloud.

A '''persistence module''' &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt; indexed by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector space &lt;math&gt;U_t&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;t \in \mathrm{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, and a linear map &lt;math&gt;u_t^s: U_s \to U_t&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;s \leq t&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;u_t^t=1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_t^su_s^r=u_t^r&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;r \leq s \leq t.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Proximity of Persistence Modules and Their Diagrams|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1542362.1542407|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the Twenty-fifth Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry|date = 2009-01-01|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 978-1-60558-501-7|pages = 237–246|series = SCG '09|doi = 10.1145/1542362.1542407|first = Frédéric|last = Chazal|first2 = David|last2 = Cohen-Steiner|first3 = Marc|last3 = Glisse|first4 = Leonidas J.|last4 = Guibas|first5 = Steve Y.|last5 = Oudot}}&lt;/ref&gt; An equivalent definition is a functor from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; considered as a partially ordered set to the category of vector spaces.

The '''persistent homology group''' &lt;math&gt;PH&lt;/math&gt; of a point cloud is the persistence module defined as &lt;math&gt;PH_k(X)= \prod H_k(X_r)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;X_r&lt;/math&gt; is the Čech complex of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; of the point cloud &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_k&lt;/math&gt; is the homology group.

A '''persistence barcode''' is a [[Multiset (abstract data type)|multiset]] of intervals in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, and a '''persistence diagram''' is a multiset of points in &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;:= \{(u,v) \in \mathbb{R}^2| u,v \geq 0, u \leq v\}&lt;/math&gt;).

The [[Wasserstein metric|'''Wasserstein distance''']] between two persistence diagrams &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math display="block"&gt;W_p[L_q](X,Y):= \inf_{\phi: X \to Y} [~\sum_{x \in X} \Vert x-\phi(x)\Vert _q~]^{\frac{1}{p}}&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;1 \leq p,q \leq \infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; ranges over bijections between &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. Please refer to figure 3.1 in Munch &lt;ref&gt;Munch E. Applications of persistent homology to time varying systems[D]. Duke University, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; for illustration.

The '''bottleneck distance''' between &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math display="block"&gt;W_{\infty}[L_q](X,Y):= \inf_{\phi: X \to Y} \sup_{x \in X} \Vert x-\phi(x)\Vert _q.&lt;/math&gt; This is a special case of Wasserstein distance, letting &lt;math&gt;p=\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Structure theorem ====
The first classification theorem for persistent homology appeared in 2005:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Computing Persistent Homology|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-004-1146-y|journal = Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry|date = 2004-11-19|issn = 0179-5376|pages = 249–274|volume = 33|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/s00454-004-1146-y|first = Afra|last = Zomorodian|first2 = Gunnar|last2 = Carlsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a finitely generated persistence module &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; with field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; coefficients, 
&lt;math display="block"&gt;H(C;F) \simeq  \bigoplus_i x^{t_i} \cdot F[x] \oplus \left(\bigoplus_j x^{r_j} \cdot (F[x]/(x^{s_j}\cdot F[x]))\right).&lt;/math&gt;
Intuitively, the free parts correspond to the homology generators that appear at filtration level &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; and never disappear, while the torsion parts correspond to those that appear at filtration level &lt;math&gt;r_j&lt;/math&gt; and last for &lt;math&gt;s_j&lt;/math&gt; steps of the filtration (or equivalently, disappear at filtration level &lt;math&gt;s_j+r_j&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;ref name="Barannikov 1994"/&gt;.

Persistent homology is visualized through a barcode or persistence diagram. The barcode has its root in abstract mathematics, though not at first sight; essentially, the derived category of chain complexes over a field is equivalent to the graded category of vector spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to Homological Algebra|url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=zh-CN&amp;lr=&amp;id=flm-dBXfZ_gC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=weibel+homological&amp;ots=_MbUFbYFtd&amp;sig=blH5vOFonrO8auLT8uOnKQ-_uRU#v=onepage&amp;q=weibel%2520homological&amp;f=false|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 1995-10-27|isbn = 9780521559874|first = Charles A.|last = Weibel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Stability ====
Stability is desirable because it provides robustness against noise.

The basic workflow in TDA is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Barcodes: The persistent topology of data|url = http://www.ams.org/bull/2008-45-01/S0273-0979-07-01191-3/|journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|date = 2008-01-01|issn = 0273-0979|pages = 61–75|volume = 45|issue = 1|doi = 10.1090/S0273-0979-07-01191-3|first = Robert|last = Ghrist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This process converts the point cloud into a filtration of simplicial complexes. Taking the homology of each complex in this filtration gives a persistence module &lt;math display="block"&gt;H_i(X_{r_0})\to H_i(X_{r_1}) \to H_i(X_{r_2}) \to \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

== Computation ==
The first algorithm for persistent homology over &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; was given by Edelsbrunner et al.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Zomorodian and Carlsson gave the first practical algorithm to compute persistent homology over all fields.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Edelsbrunner and Harer's book gives general guidance on computational topology.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Computational Topology: An Introduction|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MDXa6gFRZuIC|publisher = American Mathematical Soc.|date = 2010-01-01|isbn = 9780821849255|first = Herbert|last = Edelsbrunner|first2 = John|last2 = Harer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One issue that arises in computation is the choice of complex. The [[Čech cohomology|Čech complex]] and [[Vietoris–Rips complex|Vietoris-Rips complex]] are most natural at first glance; however, their size grows rapidly with the number of data points. The Vietoris-Rips complex is preferred over Čech complex because its definition is simpler and the Čech complex requires extra effort to define in a general finite metric space. Efficient ways to lower the computational cost of homology have been studied. For example, the α-complex and witness complex are used to reduce the dimension and size of complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Topological Estimation Using Witness Complexes|publisher = Eurographics Association|journal = Proceedings of the First Eurographics Conference on Point-Based Graphics|date = 2004-01-01|location = Aire-la-Ville, Switzerland, Switzerland|isbn = 3-905673-09-6|pages = 157–166|series = SPBG'04|doi = 10.2312/SPBG/SPBG04/157-166|first = Vin|last = De Silva|first2 = Gunnar|last2 = Carlsson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, [[Discrete Morse theory]] has shown promise for computational homology because it can reduce a given simplicial complex to a much smaller cellular complex which is homotopic to the original one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Morse Theory for Filtrations and Efficient Computation of Persistent Homology|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-013-9529-6|journal = Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry|date = 2013-07-27|issn = 0179-5376|pages = 330–353|volume = 50|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/s00454-013-9529-6|first = Konstantin|last = Mischaikow|first2 = Vidit|last2 = Nanda}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reduction can in fact be performed as the complex is constructed by using [[Matroid|matroid theory]], leading to further performance increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henselman|first1=Gregory|last2=Ghrist|first2=Robert|title=Matroid Filtrations and Computational Persistent Homology|date=1 Jun 2016|arxiv=1606.00199|bibcode=2016arXiv160600199H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another recent algorithm saves time by ignoring the homology classes with low persistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An output-sensitive algorithm for persistent homology|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772112001435|journal = Computational Geometry|date = 2013-05-01|pages = 435–447|volume = 46|series = 27th Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2011)|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/j.comgeo.2012.02.010|first = Chao|last = Chen|first2 = Michael|last2 = Kerber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visualization==
High-dimensional data is impossible to visualize directly. Many methods have been invented to extract a low-dimensional structure from the data set, such as [[principal component analysis]] and [[multidimensional scaling]].&lt;ref&gt;Liu S, Maljovec D, Wang B, et al. Visualizing High-Dimensional Data: Advances in the Past Decade[J].&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to note that the problem itself is ill-posed, since many different topological features can be found in the same data set. Thus, the study of visualization of high-dimensional spaces is of central importance to TDA, although it does not necessarily involve the use of persistent homology. However, recent attempts have been made to use persistent homology in data visualization.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Carlsson et al. have proposed a general method called '''MAPPER'''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Download Limit Exceeded|url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.161.8956&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|website = citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It inherits the idea of Serre that a covering preserves homotopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=COuPBAAAQBAJ|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date = 2013-04-17|isbn = 9781475739510|first = Raoul|last = Bott|first2 = Loring W.|last2 = Tu}}&lt;/ref&gt; A generalized formulation of MAPPER is as follows:

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; be topological spaces and let &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Z&lt;/math&gt; be a continuous map. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U} = \{U_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in A}&lt;/math&gt; be a finite open covering of &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;. The output of MAPPER is the nerve of the pullback cover &lt;math display="inline"&gt;M(\mathbb{U},f):=N(f^{-1}(\mathbb{U}))&lt;/math&gt;, where each preimage is split into its connected components.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = Mutiscale Mapper: A Framework for Topological Summarization of Data and Maps|arxiv= 1504.03763|date = 2015-04-14|first = Tamal K.|last = Dey|first2 = Facundo|last2 = Memoli|first3 = Yusu|last3 = Wang}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very general concept, of which the Reeb graph and merge trees are special cases.

This is not quite the original definition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Carlsson et al. choose &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, and cover it with open sets such that at most two intersect.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This restriction means that the output is in the form of a [[complex network]]. Because the topology of a finite point cloud is trivial, clustering methods (such as [[Single-linkage clustering|single linkage]])  are used to produce the analogue of connected sets in the preimage &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; when MAPPER is applied to actual data.

Mathematically speaking, MAPPER is a variation of the [[Reeb graph]].  If the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;M(\mathbb{U},f)&lt;/math&gt; is at most one dimensional, then for each &lt;math&gt;i \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="block"&gt;H_i(X) \simeq H_0(N(\mathbb{U});\hat{F}_i)   \oplus H_1(N(\mathbb{U});\hat{F}_{i-1}).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = Sheaves, Cosheaves and Applications|arxiv= 1303.3255|date = 2013-03-13|first = Justin|last = Curry}}&lt;/ref&gt; The added flexibility also has disadvantages. One problem is instability, in that some change of the choice of the cover can lead to major change of the output of the algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A fast algorithm for constructing topological structure in large data|url = http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.hha/1355321072|journal = Homology, Homotopy and Applications|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 1532-0073|pages = 221–238|volume = 14|issue = 1|first = Xu|last = Liu|first2 = Zheng|last2 = Xie|first3 = Dongyun|last3 = Yi|doi=10.4310/hha.2012.v14.n1.a11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work has been done to overcome this problem.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt;

Three successful applications of MAPPER can be found in Carlsson et al.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Extracting insights from the shape of complex data using topology|url = http://www.nature.com/articles/srep01236?message-global=remove&amp;WT.ec_id=SREP-639-20130301|journal = Scientific Reports|date = 2013-02-07|pmc = 3566620|pmid = 23393618|volume = 3|doi = 10.1038/srep01236|first = P.

A free implementation of MAPPER is available [http://danifold.net/mapper/ online] written by Daniel Müllner and Aravindakshan Babu. MAPPER also forms the basis of [[Ayasdi]]'s AI platform.

=== Multidimensional persistence ===
Multidimensional persistence is important to TDA. The concept arises in both theory and practice. The first investigation of multidimensional persistence was early in the development of TDA,&lt;ref&gt;Frosini P, Mulazzani M. Size homotopy groups for computation of natural size distances[J]. Bulletin of the Belgian Mathematical Society Simon Stevin, 1999, 6(3): 455-464.&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the founding papers of TDA.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The first application to appear in the literature is a method for shape comparison, similar to the invention of TDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Multidimensional Size Functions for Shape Comparison|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10851-008-0096-z|journal = Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision|date = 2008-05-17|issn = 0924-9907|pages = 161–179|volume = 32|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/s10851-008-0096-z|first = S.|last = Biasotti|first2 = A.|last2 = Cerri|first3 = P.|last3 = Frosini|first4 = D.|last4 = Giorgi|first5 = C.|last5 = Landi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of an '''''n''-dimensional persistence module''' in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 
* vector space &lt;math&gt;V_s&lt;/math&gt; is assigned to each point in &lt;math&gt;s=(s_1,...,s_n)&lt;/math&gt;
* map &lt;math&gt;\rho_s^t:V_s \to V_t&lt;/math&gt; is assigned if &lt;math&gt;s\leq t&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;s_i \leq t_i, i=1,...,n)&lt;/math&gt;
* maps satisfy &lt;math&gt;\rho_r^t=\rho_s^t \circ \rho_r^s&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;r \leq s \leq t&lt;/math&gt;
It might be worth noting that there are controversies on the definition of multidimensional persistence.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

One of the advantages of one-dimensional persistence is its representability by a diagram or barcode. However, discrete complete invariants of multidimensional persistence modules do not exist.&lt;ref name="Carlsson 71–93"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Theory of Multidimensional Persistence|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-009-9176-0|journal = Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry|date = 2009-04-24|issn = 0179-5376|pages = 71–93|volume = 42|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s00454-009-9176-0|first = Gunnar|last = Carlsson|first2 = Afra|last2 = Zomorodian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for this is that the structure of the collection of indecomposables is extremely complicated by [[Gabriel's theorem]] in the theory of quiver representations,&lt;ref&gt;Derksen H, Weyman J. Quiver representations[J]. Notices of the AMS, 2005, 52(2): 200-206.&lt;/ref&gt; although a finitely n-dim persistence module can be uniquely decomposed into a direct sum of indecomposables due to the Krull-Schmidt theorem.&lt;ref&gt;Atiyah M F. On the Krull-Schmidt theorem with application to sheaves[J]. Bulletin de la Société Mathématique de France, 1956, 84: 307-317.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, many results have been established. Carlsson and Zomorodian introduced the '''rank invariant''' &lt;math&gt;\rho_M(u,v)&lt;/math&gt;, defined as the &lt;math&gt;\rho_M(u,v)=\mathrm{rank}(x^{u-v}:M_u\to M_v)&lt;/math&gt;, in which &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a finitely generated n-graded module. In one dimension, it is equivalent to the barcode. In the literature, the rank invariant  is often referred as the persistent Betti numbers (PBNs).&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; In many theoretical works, authors have used a more restricted definition, an analogue from sublevel set persistence. Specifically,  the persistence Betti numbers of a function &lt;math&gt;f:X\to \mathrm{R}^k&lt;/math&gt; are given by the function &lt;math&gt;\beta_f: \Delta^{+} \to \mathrm{N}&lt;/math&gt;, taking each &lt;math&gt;(u,v) \in \Delta^{+}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\beta_f(u,v):= \mathrm{rank} (H(X(f\leq u)\to H(X(f\leq v)))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta^{+} := \{(u,v)\in \mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}:u\leq v\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X(f\leq u):=\{x\in X:f(x)\leq u\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Some basic properties include monotonicity and diagonal jump.&lt;ref&gt;Cerri A, Di Fabio B, Ferri M, et al. Multidimensional persistent homology is stable[J]. {{arxiv|0908.0064}}, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Persistent Betti numbers will be finite if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a compact and locally contractible subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Finiteness of rank invariants of multidimensional persistent homology groups|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893965910004118|journal = Applied Mathematics Letters|date = 2011-04-01|pages = 516–518|volume = 24|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/j.aml.2010.11.004|first = Francesca|last = Cagliari|first2 = Claudia|last2 = Landi|arxiv = 1001.0358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persistent space, a generalization of persistent diagram, is defined as the multiset of all points with multiplicity larger than 0 and the diagonal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Persistence Space in Multidimensional Persistent Homology|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-37067-0_16|publisher = Springer Berlin Heidelberg|date = 2013-03-20|isbn = 978-3-642-37066-3|pages = 180–191|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-37067-0_16|first = Andrea|last = Cerri|first2 = Claudia|last2 = Landi|editor-first = Rocio|editor-last = Gonzalez-Diaz|editor-first2 = Maria-Jose|editor-last2 = Jimenez|editor-first3 = Belen|editor-last3 = Medrano}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides a stable and complete representation of PBNs.

The first practical algorithm to compute multidimensional persistence was invented very early.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Computing Multidimensional Persistence|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-10631-6_74|publisher = Springer Berlin Heidelberg|date = 2009-12-16|isbn = 978-3-642-10630-9|pages = 730–739|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-10631-6_74|first = Gunnar|last = Carlsson|first2 = Gurjeet|last2 = Singh|first3 = Afra|last3 = Zomorodian|editor-first = Yingfei|editor-last = Dong|editor-first2 = Ding-Zhu|editor-last2 = Du|editor-first3 = Oscar|editor-last3 = Ibarra}}&lt;/ref&gt; After then, many other algorithms have been proposed, based on such concepts as discrete morse theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = Reducing complexes in multidimensional persistent homology theory|arxiv= 1310.8089|date = 2013-10-30|first = Madjid|last = Allili|first2 = Tomasz|last2 = Kaczynski|first3 = Claudia|last3 = Landi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finite sample estimating.&lt;ref&gt;Cavazza N, Ferri M, Landi C. Estimating multidimensional persistent homology through a finite sampling[J]. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other persistences ===
The standard paradigm in TDA is often referred as '''sublevel persistence'''. Apart from multidimensional persistence, many works have been done to extend this special case.

==== Zigzag persistence ====
The nonzero maps in persistence module are restricted by the preorder relationship in the category. However, mathematicians have found that the unanimity of direction is not essential to many results. "The philosophical point is that the decomposition theory of graph representations is somewhat independent of the orientation of the graph edges".&lt;ref name="Carlsson 367–405"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Zigzag Persistence|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-010-9066-0|journal = Foundations of Computational Mathematics|date = 2010-04-21|issn = 1615-3375|pages = 367–405|volume = 10|issue = 4|doi = 10.1007/s10208-010-9066-0|first = Gunnar|last = Carlsson|first2 = Vin de|last2 = Silva}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zigzag persistence is important to the theoretical side. The examples given in Carlsson's review paper to illustrate the importance of functorality all share some of its features.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Extended persistence and levelset persistence ====
Some attempts is to lose the stricter restriction of the function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Extending Persistence Using Poincaré and Lefschetz Duality|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-008-9027-z|journal = Foundations of Computational Mathematics|date = 2008-04-04|issn = 1615-3375|pages = 79–103|volume = 9|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s10208-008-9027-z|first = David|last = Cohen-Steiner|first2 = Herbert|last2 = Edelsbrunner|first3 = John|last3 = Harer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Please refer to the [[#Categorization and cosheaf|Categorization and cosheaf]] and [[#Impact on mathematics|Impact on mathematics]] sections for more information.

It's natural to extend persistence homology to other basic concepts in algebraic topology, such as cohomology and relative homology/cohomology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Dualities in persistent (co)homology|url = http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0266-5611/27/12/124003|journal = Inverse Problems|volume = 27|issue = 12|doi = 10.1088/0266-5611/27/12/124003|first = Vin|last = de Silva|first2 = Dmitriy|last2 = Morozov|first3 = Mikael|last3 = Vejdemo-Johansson|pages=124003|arxiv = 1107.5665|bibcode = 2011InvPr..27l4003D}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interesting application is the computation of circular coordinates for a data set via the first persistent cohomology group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Persistent Cohomology and Circular Coordinates|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-011-9344-x|journal = Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry|date = 2011-03-30|issn = 0179-5376|pages = 737–759|volume = 45|issue = 4|doi = 10.1007/s00454-011-9344-x|first = Vin de|last = Silva|first2 = Dmitriy|last2 = Morozov|first3 = Mikael|last3 = Vejdemo-Johansson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Circular persistence  ====
Normal persistence homology studies real-valued functions. The circle-valued map might be useful, "persistence theory for circle-valued maps promises to play the role for some vector fields as does the standard persistence theory for scalar fields", as commented in D. Burghelea et al.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Topological Persistence for Circle-Valued Maps|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-013-9497-x|journal = Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry|date = 2013-04-09|issn = 0179-5376|pages = 69–98|volume = 50|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s00454-013-9497-x|first = Dan|last = Burghelea|first2 = Tamal K.|last2 = Dey}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference is that Jordan cells(very similar in format to the ones in linear algebra) are nontrivial in circle-valued functions, which would be zero in real-valued case, and combing with barcodes give the invariants of a tame map, under moderate conditions.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt;

Two techniques they use are More-Novikov theory&lt;ref&gt;Novikov S P. Quasiperiodic structures in topology[C]//Topological methods in modern mathematics, Proceedings of the symposium in honor of John Milnor’s sixtieth birthday held at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, New York. 1991: 223-233.&lt;/ref&gt; and graph representation theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Graph Theory|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mKkIGIea_BkC|publisher = CRC Press|date = 2004-06-02|isbn = 9780203490204|first = Jonathan L.|last = Gross|first2 = Jay|last2 = Yellen}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent results can be found in D. Burghelea et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = Topology of angle valued maps, bar codes and Jordan blocks|arxiv= 1303.4328|date = 2015-06-04|first = Dan|last = Burghelea|first2 = Stefan|last2 = Haller}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the tameness requirement can be replaced by the much weaker condition, continuous.

==== Persistence with torsion ====
The proof of the structure theorem relies on the base domain being field, so not many attempts have been made on persistence homology with torsion. Frosini defined a pseudometric on this specific module and proved its stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Stable Comparison of Multidimensional Persistent Homology Groups with Torsion|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10440-012-9769-0|journal = Acta Applicandae Mathematicae|date = 2012-06-23|issn = 0167-8019|pages = 43–54|volume = 124|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s10440-012-9769-0|first = Patrizio|last = Frosini|arxiv = 1012.4169}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its novelty is that it doesn't depend on some classification theory to define the metric.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Categorification and cosheaves ===
One advantage of [[category theory]] is its ability to lift concrete results to a higher level, showing relationships between seemingly unconnected objects. Bubenik et al.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Categorification of Persistent Homology|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-014-9573-x|journal = Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry|date = 2014-01-28|issn = 0179-5376|pages = 600–627|volume = 51|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s00454-014-9573-x|first = Peter|last = Bubenik|first2 = Jonathan A.|last2 = Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a short introduction of category theory fitted for TDA.

Category theory is the language of modern algebra, and has been widely used in the study of algebraic geometry and topology. It has been noted that "the key observation of &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; is that the persistence diagram produced by &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; depends only on the algebraic structure carried by this diagram."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Metrics for Generalized Persistence Modules|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-014-9229-5|journal = Foundations of Computational Mathematics|date = 2014-10-09|issn = 1615-3375|pages = 1501–1531|volume = 15|issue = 6|doi = 10.1007/s10208-014-9229-5|first = Peter|last = Bubenik|first2 = Vin de|last2 = Silva|first3 = Jonathan|last3 = Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of category theory in TDA has proved to be fruitful.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;

Following the notations made in Bubenik et al.,&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; the '''indexing category''' &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is any [[preordered set]] (not necessarily &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;),  the target category &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is any category (instead of the commonly used &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathrm{Vect}_{\mathbb{F}}&lt;/math&gt;), and [[functor]]s &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P \to D&lt;/math&gt; are called '''generalized persistence modules''' in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, over &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

One advantage of using category theory in TDA is a clearer understanding of concepts and the discovery of new relationships between proofs. Take two examples for illustration. The understanding of the correspondence between interleaving and matching is of huge importance, since matching has been the method used in the beginning (modified from Morse theory).  A summary of works can be found in Vin de Silva et al.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Geometry in the Space of Persistence Modules|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2462356.2462402|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the Twenty-ninth Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry|date = 2013-01-01|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 978-1-4503-2031-3|pages = 397–404|series = SoCG '13|doi = 10.1145/2462356.2462402|first = Vin|last = de Silva|first2 = Vidit|last2 = Nanda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many theorems can be proved much more easily in a more intuitive setting.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Another example is the relationship between the construction of different complexes from point clouds. It has long been noticed that Čech and Vietoris-Rips complexes are related. Specifically, &lt;math&gt;V_r(X) \subset C_{\sqrt{2}r}(X) \subset V_{2r}(X)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The essential relationship between Cech and Rips complexes can be seen much more clearly in categorical language.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

The language of category theory also helps cast results in terms recognizable to the broader mathematical community.  Bottleneck distance is widely used in TDA because of the results on stability with respect to the bottleneck distance.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; In fact, the interleaving distance is the [[Initial and terminal objects|terminal object]] in a poset category of stable metrics on multidimensional persistence modules in a [[Field (mathematics)|prime field]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Theory of the Interleaving Distance on Multidimensional Persistence Modules|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-015-9255-y|journal = Foundations of Computational Mathematics|date = 2015-03-24|issn = 1615-3375|pages = 613–650|volume = 15|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s10208-015-9255-y|first = Michael|last = Lesnick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Natural Pseudo-Distance and Optimal Matching between Reduced Size Functions|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10440-008-9332-1|journal = Acta Applicandae Mathematicae|date = 2008-10-14|issn = 0167-8019|pages = 527–554|volume = 109|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/s10440-008-9332-1|first = Michele|last = d’Amico|first2 = Patrizio|last2 = Frosini|first3 = Claudia|last3 = Landi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sheaf (mathematics)|Sheaves]], a central concept in modern [[algebraic geometry]], are intrinsically related to category theory. Roughly speaking, [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] are the mathematical tool for understanding how local information determines global information. Justin Curry regards level set persistence as the study of [[Fiber (mathematics)|fibers]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; of continuous functions. The objects that he studies are very similar to those by MAPPER, but with sheaf theory as the theoretical foundation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although no breakthrough in the theory of TDA has yet used sheaf theory, it is promising since there are many beautiful theorems in algebraic geometry relating to sheaf theory. For example, a natural theoretical question is whether different filtration methods result in the same output.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Filtrations induced by continuous functions|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166864113001892|journal = Topology and its Applications|date = 2013-08-01|pages = 1413–1422|volume = 160|issue = 12|doi = 10.1016/j.topol.2013.05.013|first = B.|last = Di Fabio|first2 = P.|last2 = Frosini}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stability ===
Stability is of central importance to data analysis, since real data carry noises. By usage of category theory, Bubenik et al. have distinguished between soft and hard stability theorems, and proved that soft cases are formal.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; Specifically, general workflow of TDA is  
{| class="wikitable"
|data
|&lt;math&gt;\stackrel{F}{\longrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt;
|topological persistence module
|&lt;math&gt;\stackrel{H}{\longrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt;
|algebraic persistence module
|&lt;math&gt;\stackrel{J}{\longrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt;
|discrete invariant
|}
The soft stability theorem asserts that &lt;math&gt;HF&lt;/math&gt; is [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz continuous]], and the hard stability theorem asserts that &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is Lipschitz continuous.

Bottleneck distance is widely used in TDA. The isometry theorem asserts that the '''interleaving distance''' &lt;math&gt;d_I&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the bottleneck distance.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Bubenik et al. have abstracted the definition to that between functors &lt;math&gt;F,G: P\to D&lt;/math&gt;  when &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is equipped with a sublinear projection or superlinear family, in which still remains a pseudometric.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; Considering the magnificent characters of interleaving distance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = Multidimensional Interleavings and Applications to Topological Inference|arxiv= 1206.1365|date = 2012-06-06|first = Michael|last = Lesnick}}&lt;/ref&gt; here we introduce the general definition of interleaving distance(instead of the first introduced one):&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;\Gamma, K \in \mathrm{Trans_P}&lt;/math&gt; (a function from &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; which is monotone and satisfies &lt;math&gt;x \leq \Gamma(x)&lt;/math&gt;  for all &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x\in P&lt;/math&gt;). A &lt;math&gt;(\Gamma, K)&lt;/math&gt;-interleaving between F and G consists of natural transformations &lt;math&gt;\varphi: F \Rightarrow G\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi: G \Rightarrow FK&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;(\psi\Gamma)=\varphi F\eta_{K\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\varphi\Gamma)=\psi G\eta_{\Gamma K}&lt;/math&gt;.

The two main results are&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;     
* Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be a preordered set with a sublinear projection or superlinear family. Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;H:D \to E&lt;/math&gt; be a functor between arbitrary categories &lt;math display="inline"&gt;D,E&lt;/math&gt;. Then for any two functors &lt;math display="inline"&gt;F,G:P\to D&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math display="inline"&gt;d_I(HF,HG) \leq d_I(F,G)&lt;/math&gt;.     
* Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be a poset of a metric space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space. And let&lt;math display="inline"&gt;f,g:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; (not necessarily continuous) be functions, and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;F,G&lt;/math&gt; to be the corresponding persistence diagram. Then &lt;math&gt;d_I(F,G) \leq d_{\infty}(f,g):=\sup_{x\in X}d_Y(f(x),g(x))&lt;/math&gt;.     
These two results summarize many results on stability of different models of persistence.

=== Structure theorem ===
The structure theorem is of central importance to TDA; as commented by G. Carlsson, "what makes homology useful as a discriminator between topological spaces is the fact that there is a classification theorem for finitely generated abelian groups."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Topology and data|url = http://www.ams.org/bull/2009-46-02/S0273-0979-09-01249-X/|journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|date = 2009-01-01|issn = 0273-0979|pages = 255–308|volume = 46|issue = 2|doi = 10.1090/S0273-0979-09-01249-X|first = Gunnar|last = Carlsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]]).

The main argument used in the proof of the original structure theorem is the standard [[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, this argument fails if the indexing set is &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R},\leq)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In general, not every persistence module can be decomposed into intervals.&lt;ref name="Chazal"&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = The structure and stability of persistence modules|arxiv= 1207.3674|date = 2012-07-16|first = Frederic|last = Chazal|first2 = Vin|last2 = de Silva|first3 = Marc|last3 = Glisse|first4 = Steve|last4 = Oudot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many attempts have been made at relaxing the restrictions of the original structure theorem.{{Clarify|date=December 2015}} The case for pointwise finite-dimensional persistence modules indexed by a locally finite subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is solved based on the work of Webb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decomposition of graded modules|url = http://www.ams.org/proc/1985-094-04/S0002-9939-1985-0792261-6/|journal = Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society|date = 1985-01-01|issn = 0002-9939|pages = 565–571|volume = 94|issue = 4|doi = 10.1090/S0002-9939-1985-0792261-6|first = Cary|last = Webb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable result is done by Crawley-Boevey, which solved the case of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Crawley-Boevey's theorem states that any pointwise finite-dimensional persistence module is a direct sum of interval modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decomposition of pointwise finite-dimensional persistence modules|url = http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S0219498815500668|journal = Journal of Algebra and Its Applications|volume = 14|issue = 05|doi = 10.1142/s0219498815500668|first = William|last = Crawley-Boevey|pages=1550066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the definition of his theorem, some concepts need introducing. An '''interval''' in &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R},\leq)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as a subset &lt;math&gt;I \subset \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; having the property that if &lt;math&gt;r, t \in I&lt;/math&gt; and if there is an &lt;math&gt;s \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;r \leq s \leq t&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;s\in I&lt;/math&gt; as well. An '''interval module''' &lt;math&gt;k_I&lt;/math&gt; assigns to each element &lt;math&gt;s\in I&lt;/math&gt; the vector space &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and assigns the zero vector space to elements in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R} / I&lt;/math&gt;. All maps &lt;math&gt;\rho_s^t&lt;/math&gt; are the zero map, unless &lt;math&gt;s,t \in I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s\leq t&lt;/math&gt;, in which case &lt;math&gt;\rho_s^t&lt;/math&gt; is the identity map.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Interval modules are indecomposable.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = The observable structure of persistence modules|arxiv= 1405.5644|date = 2014-05-22|first = Frederic|last = Chazal|first2 = William|last2 = Crawley-Boevey|first3 = Vin|last3 = de Silva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the result of Crawley-Boevey is a very powerful theorem, it still doesn't extend to the q-tame case.&lt;ref name="Chazal"/&gt; A persistence module is '''q-tame''' if the  rank of &lt;math&gt;\rho_s^t&lt;/math&gt; is finite for all &lt;math&gt;s\leq t&lt;/math&gt;. There are examples of q-tame persistence modules that fail to be pointwise finite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = A subset of Euclidean space with large Vietoris-Rips homology|arxiv= 1210.4097|date = 2012-10-15|first = Jean-Marie|last = Droz}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it turns out that a similar structure theorem still holds if the features that exist only at one index value are removed.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This holds because the infinite dimensional parts at each index value do not persist, due to the finite-rank condition.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;Weinberger S. What is... persistent homology?[J]. Notices of the AMS, 2011, 58(1): 36-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Formally, the observable category &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ob}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Pers}/\mathrm{Eph}&lt;/math&gt;, in which &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Eph}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the full subcategory of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Pers}&lt;/math&gt; whose objects are the ephemeral modules (&lt;math&gt;\rho^t_s=0&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;s &lt; t&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Note that the extended results listed here do not apply to zigzag persistence, since the analogue of a zigzag persistence module over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is not immediately obvious.

=== Statistics ===
Real data is always finite, and so its study requires us to take stochasticity into account. Statistical analysis gives us the ability to separate true features of the data from artifacts introduced by random noise. Persistent homology has no inherent mechanism to distinguish between low-probability features and high-probability features.

One way to apply statistics to topological data analysis is to study the statistical properties of topological features of point clouds. The study of random simplicial complexes offers some insight into statistical topology. K. Turner et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fréchet Means for Distributions of Persistence Diagrams|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-014-9604-7|journal = Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry|date = 2014-07-12|issn = 0179-5376|pages = 44–70|volume = 52|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s00454-014-9604-7|first = Katharine|last = Turner|first2 = Yuriy|last2 = Mileyko|first3 = Sayan|last3 = Mukherjee|first4 = John|last4 = Harer}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a summary of work in this vein.

Another way is to study probability distributions on the persistence space. The persistence space &lt;math&gt;B_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\coprod_n B_{n}/ \backsim&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;B_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is the space of all barcodes containing exactly &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; intervals and the equivalences are &lt;math&gt;\{[x_1,y_1],[x_2,y_2],...,[x_n,y_n]\} \backsim \{[x_1,y_1],[x_2,y_2],...,[x_{n-1},y_{n-1}]\}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x_n = y_n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Topological pattern recognition for point cloud data|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0962492914000051|journal = Acta Numerica|date = 2014-05-01|issn = 1474-0508|pages = 289–368|volume = 23|doi = 10.1017/S0962492914000051|first = Gunnar|last = Carlsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; This space is fairly complicated; for example, it is not complete under the bottleneck metric. The first attempt made to study it is by Y.

A nice property is that &lt;math&gt;D_p&lt;/math&gt; is complete and separable in the Wasserstein metric &lt;math&gt;W_p(u,v)=\left(\inf_{\gamma\in \Gamma(u,v)}\int_{\mathbb{X}\times \mathbb{X}} \rho^p(x,y)\mathrm{d}\gamma(x,y)\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}&lt;/math&gt;. Expectation, variance, and conditional probability can be defined in the [[Fréchet mean|Fréchet sense]]. This allows many statistical tools to be ported to TDA.

Persistence landscapes, introduced by Peter Bubenik, are a different way to represent of barcodes, more amenable to statistical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = Statistical topological data analysis using persistence landscapes|arxiv= 1207.6437|date = 2012-07-26|first = Peter|last = Bubenik}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''persistence landscape''' of a persistent module &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is defined as a function &lt;math&gt;\lambda:\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{R}\to \bar{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda(k,t):=\sup(m\geq 0|\beta^{t-m,t-m}\geq k)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Extended real number line|extended real line]] and &lt;math&gt;\beta^{a,b}=\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{im}(M(a\leq b)))&lt;/math&gt;. The space of persistence landscapes is very nice: it inherits all good properties of barcode representation (stability, easy representation, etc.), but statistical quantities can be readily defined, and some problems in Y. Mileyko et al.'s work, such as the non-uniqueness of expectations,&lt;ref name=":20"/&gt; can be overcome.

Besides the obvious need for algebra and topology, partial differential equations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = Objective-oriented Persistent Homology|arxiv= 1412.2368|date = 2014-12-07|first = Bao|last = Wang|first2 = Guo-Wei|last2 = Wei}}&lt;/ref&gt; algebraic geometry,&lt;ref name="Carlsson 71–93" /&gt; presentation theory,&lt;ref name="Carlsson 367–405" /&gt; statistics, combinatorics, and Riemannian geometry&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; have all found use in TDA.  
# '''Quantitative analysis'''. Topology is considered to be very soft since many concepts are invariant under homotopy. However, persistent topology is able to record the birth (appearance) and death (disappearance) of topological features, thus extra geometric information is embedded in it. One evidence in theory is a partially positive result on the uniqueness of reconstruction of curves;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Uniqueness of models in persistent homology: the case of curves|url = http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0266-5611/27/12/124005 |doi = 10.1088/0266-5611/27/12/124005 | volume=27|journal=Inverse Problems|pages=124005|first = Patrizio|last = Frosini|first2 = Claudia|last2 = Landi|arxiv=1012.5783|bibcode=2011InvPr..27l4005F}}&lt;/ref&gt; two in application are on the quantitative analysis of Fullerene stability and quantitative analysis of [[self-similarity]], separately.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Persistent homology for the quantitative prediction of fullerene stability|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.23816/abstract|journal = Journal of Computational Chemistry|date = 2015-03-05|issn = 1096-987X|pmc = 4324100|pmid = 25523342|pages = 408–422|volume = 36|issue = 6|doi = 10.1002/jcc.23816|first = Kelin|last = Xia|first2 = Xin|last2 = Feng|first3 = Yiying|last3 = Tong|first4 = Guo Wei|last4 = Wei}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# '''The role of short persistence'''. Short persistence has also been found to be useful, despite the common belief that noise is the cause of the phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Persistent homology analysis of protein structure, flexibility, and folding|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cnm.2655/abstract|journal = International Journal for Numerical Methods in Biomedical Engineering|date = 2014-08-01|issn = 2040-7947|pmc = 4131872|pmid = 24902720|pages = 814–844|volume = 30|issue = 8|doi = 10.1002/cnm.2655|first = Kelin|last = Xia|first2 = Guo-Wei|last2 = Wei}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is interesting to the mathematical theory.
One of the main fields of data analysis today is [[machine learning]]. Some examples of machine learning in TDA can be found in Adcock et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The ring of algebraic functions on persistence bar codes|url = http://intlpress.com/site/pub/files/_fulltext/journals/hha/2016/0018/0001/HHA-2016-0018-0001-a021.pdf|journal=Homology, Homotopy, and Applications|date = 2016-05-31|pages = 381–402|volume = 18|issue = 1|doi = 10.4310/hha.2016.v18.n1.a21|first = Aaron|last = Adcock|first2 = Erik|last2 = Carlsson|first3 = Gunnar|last3=Carlsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [http://www.birs.ca/events/2012/5-day-workshops/12w5081 conference] is dedicated to the link between TDA and machine learning. In order to apply tools from machine leaning, the information obtained from TDA should be represented in vector form. An ongoing and promising attempt is the persistence landscape discussed above. Another attempt uses the concept of persistence images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = Persistence Images: An Alternative Persistent Homology Representation|arxiv= 1507.06217|date = 2015-07-22|first = Sofya|last = Chepushtanova|first2 = Tegan|last2 = Emerson|first3 = Eric|last3 = Hanson|first4 = Michael|last4 = Kirby|first5 = Francis|last5 = Motta|first6 = Rachel|last6 = Neville|first7 = Chris|last7 = Peterson|first8 = Patrick|last8 = Shipman|first9 = Lori|last9 = Ziegelmeier}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one problem of this method is the loss of stability, since the hard stability theorem depends on the barcode representation.

=== Impact on mathematics ===
Topological data analysis and persistent homology have had impacts on [[Morse theory]]. Morse theory has played a very important role in the theory of TDA, including on computation. Some work in persistent homology has extended results about Morse functions to tame functions or, even to continuous functions. A forgotten result of R. Deheuvels long before the invention of persistent homology extends Morse theory to all continuous functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Topologie D'Une Fonctionnelle|journal = Annals of Mathematics|date = 1955-01-01|pages = 13–72|volume = 61|series = Second Series|issue = 1|doi = 10.2307/1969619|first = Rene|last = Deheuvels|jstor=1969619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One recent result is that the category of [[Reeb graph]]s is equivalent to a particular class of cosheaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Categorified Reeb graphs|journal=Discrete and Computational Geometry|first=Vin|last=de Silva|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Munch|first3=Amit|last3 = Patel|doi=10.1007/s00454-016-9763-9|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00454-016-9763-9|date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is motivated by theoretical work in TDA, since the Reeb graph is related to Morse theory and MAPPER is derived from it. The proof of this theorem relies on the interleaving distance.

It is evident to mathematicians that persistent homology is closely related to [[spectral sequence]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Surveys on Discrete and Computational Geometry: Twenty Years Later : AMS-IMS-SIAM Joint Summer Research Conference, June 18-22, 2006, Snowbird, Utah|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ecUbCAAAQBAJ|publisher = American Mathematical Soc.|date = 2008-01-01|isbn = 9780821842393|first = Jacob E.|last = Goodman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zigzag persistence may turn out to be of theoretical importance to spectral sequences.

Historically and presently, in many parts of the world, women's participation in the profession of medicine (as [[physician]]s or [[surgeons]] for instance) has been significantly restricted. However, women's informal practice of medicine in roles such as caregivers or as [[allied health professions|allied health professionals]] has been widespread. Most countries of the world now provide women with equal access to [[medical education]]. However, not all countries ensure equal employment opportunities,&lt;ref&gt;See generally, "Women's Human Rights", 1998, [[Human Rights Watch]] (available [https://www.hrw.org/worldreport99/women/women3.html online]).&lt;/ref&gt; and gender equality has yet to be achieved within medical [[Specialty (medicine)|specialties]] and around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reichenbach|first=Laura|last2=Brown|first2=Hilary|date=2004-10-02|title=Gender and academic medicine: impacts on the health workforce|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|volume=329|issue=7469|pages=792–795|issn=0959-8138|pmid=15459056|doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7469.792|pmc=521007}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite studies suggesting that female doctors may be providing higher-quality care than male doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsugawa|first=Yusuke|last2=Jena|first2=Anupam B.|last3=Figueroa|first3=Jose F.|last4=Orav|first4=E.

They continued to practice without formal training or recognition in England and eventually North America for the next several centuries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;The History of Women in Surgery, by Debrah A. Wirtzfeld, MD&lt;/ref&gt;  Women's participation in the medical professions was generally limited by legal and social practices during the decades while medicine was [[professionalization|professionalizing]].&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich-English-1973-Witches"&gt;See generally [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] &amp; [[Deirdre English]], ''Witches, Midwives, and Nurses'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; However, women openly practiced medicine in the [[allied health professions]] ([[nursing]], [[midwifery]], etc.), and throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, women made significant gains in access to [[medical education]] and medical work through much of the world. These gains were sometimes tempered by setbacks; for instance, [[Mary Roth Walsh]] documented a ''decline'' in women physicians in the US in the first half of the twentieth century, such that there were fewer women physicians in 1950 than there were in 1900.&lt;ref name="Walsh-1977"&gt;Walsh, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, through the latter half of the twentieth century, women made gains generally across the board. In the United States, for instance, women were 9% of total US medical school enrollment in 1969; this had increased to 20% in 1976.&lt;ref name="Walsh-1977" /&gt;  By 1985, women constituted 16% of practicing US physicians.&lt;ref name="Morantz-Sanchez-2001-preface"&gt;Morantz-Sanchez, Preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the twenty-first century in industrialized nations, women have made significant gains, but have yet to achieve parity throughout the medical profession.  Women have achieved parity in medical school in some industrialized countries, since 2003 forming the majority of the United States medical student body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aamc.org/newsroom/pressrel/2003/031104.htm "Applicants to U.S. Medical Schools Increase; Women the Majority for the First Time"],  [[Association of American Medical Colleges]], Nov. 3, 2003, press release ("Women made up the majority of medical school applicants for the first time ever").&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007-2008, women accounted for 49% of medical school applicants and 48.3% of those accepted.&lt;ref name="aamc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aamc.org/download/153708/data/ |format=PDF |title=U.S. Medical School Applicants and Students 1982-1983 to 2011-2012 |work=aamc.org |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;!--dead link: http://www.aamc.org/data/facts/charts1982to2007.pdf --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) 48.3% (16,838) of medical degrees awarded in the US in 2009-10 were earned by women, an increase from 26.8% in 1982-3.&lt;ref name="aamc" /&gt; While more women are taking part in the medical field, a 2013-2014 study reported that there are significantly fewer women in leadership positions within the academic realm of medicine. This study found that women accounted for 16% of deans, 21% of the professors, and 38% of faculty, as compared to their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Rebecca M. "Gender Inequality in Medicine: Too Much Evidence to Ignore." Psychiatric Times, vol. 34, no. 5, September 2017, pp. 1–5., http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/blogs/early-career-psychiatry/gender-inequality-medicine-too-much-evidence-ignore&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the practice of medicine remains disproportionately male overall. In industrialized nations, the recent parity in gender of medical students has not yet trickled into parity in practice. In many developing nations, neither medical school nor practice approach gender parity.

Moreover, there are skews within the medical profession: some medical specialties, such as surgery, are significantly male-dominated,&lt;ref&gt;Dixie Mills, "Women in Surgery - Past, Present, and Future" (2003 presentation), [[Association of Women Surgeons]]; available at [http://www.womensurgeons.org/about/items/womeninsurgery2003c.ppt AWS website].&lt;/ref&gt; while other specialties are significantly female-dominated, or are becoming so. In the United States, female physicians outnumber male physicians in pediatrics and female residents outnumber male residents in family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pathology, and psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/16229.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102101755/http://www.ama-assn.org:80/ama/pub/category/16229.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 November 2007 |title=AMA (WPC) Table 16 - Physician Specialties by Gender- 2006 |date=25 September 2015 |work=Women Physicians Congress (WPC) |accessdate=10 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/12915.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022162222/http://www.ama-assn.org:80/ama/pub/category/12915.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 October 2004 |title=AMA (WPC) Table 4 - Women Residents by Specialty - 2005 |date=25 September 2015 |work=Women Physicians Congress (WPC) |accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women continue to dominate in nursing. In 2000, 94.6% of registered nurses in the United States were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/healthworkforce/reports/rnsurvey/rnss1.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030212144558/http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/healthworkforce/reports/rnsurvey/rnss1.htm |archivedate=2003-02-12 |deadurl=yes |title=The Registered Nurse Population |date=March 2000 |work=bhpr.hrsa.gov |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In health care professions as a whole in the US, women numbered approximately 14.8 million, as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/05/13/womens-health-at-work/ |title = Women’s Health at Work |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |accessdate = 21 January 2015 |date = 13 May 2013 |first1 = Naomi |last1 = Swanson |first2 = Julie |last2 = Tisdale-Pardi |first3 = Leslie |last3 = MacDonald |first4 = Hope M. |last4 = Tiesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomedical research and academic medical professions—i.e., faculty at medical schools—are also disproportionately male. Research on this issue, called the "leaky pipeline" by the [[National Institutes of Health]] and other researchers, shows that while women have achieved parity with men in entering graduate school, a variety of discrimination causes them to drop out at each stage in the academic pipeline: graduate school, [[postdoc]], faculty positions, achieving tenure; and, ultimately, in receiving recognition for groundbreaking work.&lt;ref&gt;The term was coined by S.E. Berryman in "Who Will Do Science?", 1983; see Louise Luckenbill-Edds, [http://www.ascb.org/index.cfm?id=1584&amp;navid=112&amp;tcode=nws3 "2000 WICB / Career Strategy Columns (Archive)"], Nov. 1, 2000, WICB Newsletter, ''American Society for Cell Biology''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

=== Glass ceiling ===
The [[glass ceiling]] is used as a metaphor to convey the undefined obstacles that women and minorities face in the workplace.

One study surveyed physician mothers and their physician daughters in order to analyze the effect that discrimination and harassment have on the individual and their career. This study included 84% of physician mothers that graduated medical school prior to 1970, with the majority of these physicians graduating in the 1950s and 1960s. The authors of this study stated that discrimination in the medical field persisted after the title VII discrimination legislation was passed in 1965.&lt;ref name="10.1089/jwh.2006.0127"&gt;Shrier, Diane K.; Zucker, Alyssa N.; Mercurio, Andrea E.; Landry, Laura J.; Rich, Michael; Shrier, Lydia A. (2007). "Generation to Generation: Discrimination and Harassment Experiences of Physician Mothers and Their Physician Daughters".&amp;nbsp;''Journal of Women's Health''.&amp;nbsp;'''16'''&amp;nbsp;(6): 1–13.&amp;nbsp;{{doi|10.1089/jwh.2006.0127}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to this study, one third of physician daughters reported experiencing a form of gender discrimination in medical school, field training, and the work environment. This study also stated that both generations equally experienced gender discrimination within their work environments.

This article provided an overview on the history of gender discrimination, claiming that gender initiated the systematic exclusion of women from medical schools. This was the case until 1970, when the National Organization for Women (NOW) filed a class action lawsuit against all medical schools in the United States. &amp;nbsp;More specifically, this lawsuit was successful in forcing medical schools to comply to the civil rights legislation. This success was seen by 1975 when the number of women in medicine had nearly tripled, and continued to grow as the years progressed. By 2005, over 25% of physicians and around 50% of medical school students were women. The increase of women in medicine also came with an increase of women identifying as a racial/ethnic minority, yet this population is still largely underrepresented in comparison to the general population of the medical field.&lt;ref name="10.1089/jwh.2006.0127"/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Within this specific study, 22% of physician mothers and 24% of physician daughters identified themselves as being an ethnic minority. These women reported experiencing instances of exclusion from career opportunities as a result of their [[Intersectionality|race and gender]].&amp;nbsp;

In an article titled "I'm too used to it”: A longitudinal qualitative study of third year female medical students' experiences of gendered encounters in medical education," the author described how confidence in ability varies based upon gender. According to this article, females tend to have lessened confidence in their abilities as a doctor, yet their performance is equivalent to that of their male counterparts. This study also commented on the impact of power dynamics within medical school, which is established as a hierarchy that ultimately shapes the educational experience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Specifically, this article described how power dynamics led to the formation of a “hidden curriculum” in medical school, which revolves around understanding the contribution of gender roles in regards to being a female doctor. According to this article, this position holds females more accountable for their actions as a result of unrealistic expectations set forth by these gender roles, which expects female doctors to take on a nurturing and matronly persona when dealing with patients. The hidden curriculum, according to this article, is an integral aspect of a female's medical education that must be learned in order to tolerate instances of gender discrimination.

On the topic of power dynamics, another study commented on the nature of sexual harassment, stating that it was most commonly perpetrated within career training stages, by people in positions of power. According to this article, instances of sexual harassment attribute to the high attrition rates of females in the STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Clancy K. H., Nelson R.

Another study describes sexual harassment as a growing problem due to the fact that it goes widely underreported, which is said to be caused by the transient nature of career training, alongside weak policies and the perpetrators holding positions of power over the victim.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Babaria|first=Palav|last2=Abedin|first2=Sakena|last3=Berg|first3=David|last4=Nunez-Smith|first4=Marcella|date=2012-04-01|title="I'm too used to it": A longitudinal qualitative study of third year female medical students' experiences of gendered encounters in medical education|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953612000780|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=74|issue=7|pages=1013–1020|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.11.043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's Contributions to Medicine in the United States==

Women have successfully provided the world with information not previously known. A few women who provided knowledge were:
 
'''Helen Brooke Taussig:''' ''The First Female President of the American Heart Association''

[[Helen B. Taussig|Helen Brooke Taussig]] was born on May 24, 1898, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. She is most commonly known as the first female president of the American Heart Association&lt;ref name=TaussigEB&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Helen-Brooke-Taussig|title=Helen Brooke Taussig {{!}} American physician|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taussig was diagnosed with [[Dyslexia]] when she was young. Around the same time, her mother, Edith Guild Taussig (1861-1909) died.&lt;ref name=TaussigEB/&gt; Her father, [[Frank William Taussig]] (1859-1940), was an economist and educator in the United States. He was also known for creating the "Foundation of Modern [[International trade|Trade Theory"]].  Taussig earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B]] from [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1921. In 1922 she applied at [[Harvard Medical School|Harvard University's Medical School]], and was denied. The University was not accepting women at the time. Instead she graduated from [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine|Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]] in 1927. In her 30s, Taussig grew deaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/013500/013565/html/13565bio.html|title=Helen Brooke Taussig|last=Morton|first=Lauren|date=2005|website=Archives of Maryland|archive-url=|archive-date=December 5, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, Taussig was appointed the Head of he Children's Hear Clinic at the Harriet Lane home, which was part of Johns Hopkins University. Due to her inability to hear, Taussig found an alternative method to studying the heartbeat in children by feeling the beat with her hands. This method lead her to discover [[Blue baby syndrome|"Blue Baby Syndrome]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blalock|first=Alfred|date=1945-05-19|title=THE SURGICAL TREATMENT OF MALFORMATIONS OF THE HEART|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.1945.02860200029009|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|language=en|volume=128|issue=3|doi=10.1001/jama.1945.02860200029009|issn=0002-9955|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was termed so due to the cyanotic hue resembling babies who were thought to be ill. In 1947, a surgeon named [[Alfred Blalock]] teamed up with Taussig and wrote an article called,&lt;ref&gt;"Congenital Malformations of the Heart",&lt;/ref&gt; which explored their creation and alternative approach for a stunt-"[[Blalock–Taussig shunt|Blalock-Taussig Shunt]]"- that would help circulate blood from the lungs to the heart. In the article it states, "The operation here reported and the studies leading thereto were undertaken with the conviction that even though the structure of the heart was grossly abnormal, in many instances it might be possible to alter the course of the circulation in such a manner as to lessen the 'cyanosis' and the resultant disability." (Read before the [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] Medical Society, March 12, 1945.) Taussig received multiple awards after 1950. In 1954, Taussig received the Albert Lasker award, which is awarded for outstanding contributions to medicine. In 1959, Taussig was acknowledged for being one of the first women who received full professorship to Johns Hopkins University. In 1964, Taussig was awarded the [[Medal of Freedom|medal of freedom]] from President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Finally, in 1965, Taussig was known as the first women of the [[American Heart Association]], for which she is so prominently known for. To further her interest in pediatrics, nearly a decade and a half later in the 1960s, Taussig remained to advocate for children's&lt;ref name=Dunbar/&gt; health. She was "responsible for investigating the epidemic of serious congenital limb malformations". This investigation focused on European children and Taussig had a theory that the malformations were caused by the use of [[Thalidomide]]. She resolved this ongoing issue by persuading the [[Food and Drug Administration]] to discontinue the use and sale of Thalidomide in the U.S

'''Helen Flanders Dunbar:''' ''The "Mother" of Holistic Medicine''

[[Helen Flanders Dunbar]] was born in [[Chicago]] on May 14, 1902, and Dunbar was the oldest child. Dunbar's mother, Edith Vaughn Flanders (1871-1963), was an Episcopalian clergyman's daughter as well as a professional [[Genealogy|Genealogist]]. Dunbar's father, Francis William Dunbar (1868-1939), was very much established as well due to his standing as an electrical engineer, as well as a patent attorney. In her early life, Dunbar's education was strictly limited to tutors and attending private schools. She graduated from [[Brearley School]], which was located in [[New York City]], in 1919, which lead to her enrollment in [[Bryn Mawr College]]. At this particular point in her life her interest in [[theology]], [[philosophy]], and medicine. Dunbar met [[James H. Leuba|James Henry Leuba]] at [[Bryn Mawr College]], which sparked her interest due to his standing as a psychologist of religion at the college. In the summer of 1929, after successfully receiving a bachelor's degree in mathematics and psychology from [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]], Dunbar continued her education by spending five weeks in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], Massachusetts receiving clinical training. In 1927, Dunbar received a [[bachelor's degree]] as [[Latin honors|"Magna Cum Laude]]" from Union Theological Seminar. This achievement was awarded primarily due to her thesis, "Methods Training in the Devotional Life Emphasized in the American Churches".&lt;ref name=Dunbar/&gt; Dunbar also won a travelling Fellowship due to this particular piece of writing. From 1931 until 1936, Dunbar held the position as director of Joint Committee of the [[New York City]] Religion and Health of the Federal Council and Churches of the Academy of Medicine. From 1943 until the year before she died, Dunbar wrote an assortment of books including: [http://www.womeninmedicinemagazine.com/profile-of-women-in-medicine/helen-flanders-dunbar-pioneer-in-psychosomatic-medicine "Psychosomatic Diagnosis]" in 1943, "Mind, Body: Psychosomatic Medicine"&lt;ref name=Dunbar&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/helen-flanders-dunbar/|title=Helen Flanders Dunbar|last=Young|first=Tracy L.|date=2010|website=Psychology's Feminist Voices|archive-url=|archive-date=2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1947, "Your Child's Mind and Body; A practical guide for parents" in 1949, and "Illness: the realization of an infant's fantasy with special reference to testing methods" in 1951. During the year of her death, Dunbar wrote "Accidents of Life Experience", "Basic aspects and applications of the psychology of safety", and "Psychiatry in medicine specialties".&lt;ref name=Dunbar/&gt; Helen Flanders Dunbar died in 1959.

==Midwifery in 18th Century America==
As per the documentary “A Midwife’s Tale”, historian of 18th century America, [[Laurel Thatcher Ulrich]], follows the diary of [[Martha Ballard]], which proves to be a telling source of women's roles as medical practitioners. Out of the different occupations women took on around this time, [[midwifery]] was the best paid of them all.&lt;ref name="Ulrich"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ulrich|first1=Laurel Thatcher|title=A Midwife's Tale: The Life of Martha Ballard, Based on Her Diary, 1785-1812|date=1990|publisher=Knopf|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[18th century]], households tended to have an abundance of children largely in part to have a helping hand in responsibilities and to combat high mortality rates.&lt;ref name="McMillen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McMillen|first1=Sally Gregory|title=Motherhood in the Old South: Pregnancy, Childbirth and Infant Rearing|date=1990|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|isbn=0807115177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the high chance of complications in labor, Martha Ballard, specifically, had high success rates in delivering healthy babies to healthy mothers.&lt;ref name="Ulrich" /&gt;

==Competition Between Midwifery and Obstetrics==
A shift from women midwifery to male obstetrics occurs in the growth of medical practices such as the founding of the [[American Medical Association]].&lt;ref name="Feldhusen" /&gt; Instead of assisting labor in the basis of an emergency, there were doctors such as Dr. Benjamin Page who wanted to take over the delivery of babies completely; putting midwifery second.&lt;ref name="Ulrich" /&gt; This is an example of the growing sense of competition between male physicians and female midwives as a rise in obstetrics took hold. The education of women on the basis of midwifery was stunted by both physicians and public-health reformers, driving midwifery to be seen as out of practice.&lt;ref name="Brodsky"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brodsky|first1=Phyllis L|title=Where have all the midwives gone?|journal=Journal of Perinatal Education|date=2008|volume=17|issue=4|doi=10.1624/105812408X324912|pmid=19436438|pmc=2582410|pages=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Societal roles also played a fact in the downfall of the practice in midwifery because women were unable to obtain the education needed for licensing and once married, women were to embrace a domestic lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Feldhusen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://midwiferytoday.com/web-article/history-midwifery-childbirth-america-time-line/|last1=Feldhusen|first1=Adrian E|title=The History of Midwifery and Childbirth in America: A Time Line|website=Midwifery Today|publisher=Midwifery Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient medicine===
The involvement of women in the field of [[medicine]] has been recorded in several early civilizations. An [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] of the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]] or [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]], [[Merit-Ptah]], described in an inscription as "chief physician", is the earliest woman named in the [[history of science]]. [[Agamede]] was cited by [[Homer]] as a healer in [[ancient Greece]] before the [[Trojan War]]. [[Agnodice]] was the first female [[physician]] to practice legally in 4th century BC [[Athens]].  [[Metrodora]] was a physician and generally regarded as the first [[medical writing|medical writer]]. Her book, ''On the Diseases and Cures of Women'', was the oldest medical book written by a female and was often referenced by many other female physicians. She credited much of her writings to the ideologies of [[Hippocrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Most Influential Women In Medicine: From The Past To The Present|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/most-influential-women-medicine-past-present-270560|website=Medical Daily|accessdate=24 September 2017|language=en|date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Europe===
During the [[Middle Ages]], [[convent]]s were an important place of education for women, and some of these communities provided opportunities for women to contribute to scholarly [[research]]. An example is the [[Germans|German]] [[abbess]] [[Hildegard of Bingen]], whose prolific writings include treatments of various scientific subjects, including [[medicine]], [[botany]] and [[natural history]] (c.1151-58).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staff.uni-mainz.de/horst/hildegard/documents/flanagan.html |title=Hildegard von Bingen (1098-1179) |author=Sabina Flanagan |publisher=University of Adelaide |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406172530/http://www.staff.uni-mainz.de/horst/hildegard/documents/flanagan.html |archivedate=2005-04-06 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is considered Germany's first female [[physician]].&lt;ref name=hildegard&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Hildegard von Bingen | encyclopedia = Key Figures in Medieval Europe - An Encyclopedia | editor = Richard K.

Women in the Middle Ages participated in many healing techniques and capacities. According to historical documents, small numbers of women occupied almost all ranks of medical personnel during the period.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=Monica|title=Women's Medical Practice and Health Care in Medieval Europe|journal=Signs|date=1989|volume=14|issue=2|pages=434–473|doi=10.1086/494516|jstor=3174557}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worked as [[herbalists]], [[midwives]], [[surgeons]], [[barber-surgeons]], nurses, and traditional [[empirics]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minkowski|first1=William L.|title=Women healers of the middle ages: selected aspects of their history.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=1992|volume=82|issue=2|pages=288–295|doi=10.2105/ajph.82.2.288|pmid=1739168|pmc=1694293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women treated everyone, not only women as historians once thought. The names of 24 women described as surgeons in Naples between 1273 and 1410 are known, and references have been found to 15 women practitioners, most of them Jewish and none described as midwives, in Frankfurt between 1387 and 1497.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siraisi|first1=Nancy G.|title=Medieval and Early Renaissance Medicine: An Introduction to Knowledge and Practice|date=2009-05-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-76131-2|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Women also engaged in midwifery and healing arts without leaving any trace of their activities in written records, and practiced in rural areas or where there was little access to medical care.
Society in the Middle Ages limited women's role as physician. Once universities established faculties of medicine during the thirteenth century, women were excluded from advanced medical education.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Licensure began to require clerical vows for which women were ineligible, and healing as a profession became male dominated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In many occasions, women had to fight against accusation of illegal practice done by males, putting into question their real motives. If they were not accused of malpractice, then women were considered "witches" by both clerical and civil authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minkowski|first1=WL|title=Women healers of the middle ages: selected aspects of their history|date=1992|journal=Am J Public Health|pmc=1694293|pmid=1739168|volume=82|issue=2|pages=288–95|doi=10.2105/ajph.82.2.288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because surgeons and barber-surgeons were often organized into guilds, they could hold out longer against the pressures of licensure. Like other guilds, a number of the barber-surgeon guilds allowed the daughters and wives of their members to take up membership in the guild, generally after the man's death. According to documents, Katherine la surgiene of London, daughter of Thomas the surgeon and sister of William the Surgeon belonged to a guild in 1286.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rawcliffe|first1=Carole|title=Medicine and Society in Later Medieval England|date=1997|publisher=Sutton|location=Stroud, Gloucestershire|isbn=978-0-7509-1497-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documentation of female members in the guilds of Lincoln, Norwich, Dublin and York continue until late in the period. Midwives, those who assisted pregnant women through childbirth and some aftercare, included only women. Midwives constituted roughly one third of female medical practitioners.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Men did not involve themselves in women's medical care, likewise, women did not involve themselves in men's health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=Monica|title=Women's Medical Practice and Health Care in Medieval Europe|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|jstor=3174557|volume=14|issue=2|pages=434–473|doi=10.1086/494516|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The southern [[Italy|Italian]] coastal town of Salerno was an important center of medical learning and practice in the 12th century.  There, the physician [[Trota of Salerno]] gathered a number of her medical practices in several written collections.  One work on women's medicine that was associated with her, the ''De curis mulierum'' ("On Treatments for Women") formed the core of what came to be known as the ''[[Trotula]]'' ensemble, a compendium of three texts that circulated throughout medieval Europe.  Trota herself gained a reputation that spread as far as France and England.  There are also references in the writings of other Salernitan physicians to the ''mulieres Salernitane'' ("Salernitan women"), which give some idea of local empirical practices.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ed. and trans., ''The 'Trotula': A Medieval Compendium of Women’s Medicine'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dorotea Bucca]] was another distinguished Italian physician. She held a chair of philosophy and medicine at the University of Bologna for over forty years from 1390.&lt;ref name=wise&gt;{{cite journal| author= JS Edwards |title= A Woman Is Wise: The Influence of Civic and Christian Humanism on the Education of Women in Northern Italy and England during the Renaissance |journal=Ex Post Facto: Journal of the History Students at San Francisco State University |volume =XI | year=2002 |url=http://userwww.sfsu.edu/~epf/2002/edwards.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RoqNOWuNa8oC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=%22dorotea+bucca%22 Howard S.

===Medieval Islamic world===
For the medieval Islamic world, little specific information is known about female medical practitioners although it is likely that women were regularly involved in medical practice in some capacity.  Male medical writers refer to the presence of female practitioners (singular, ''ṭabība'') in describing certain procedures or situations.  For example, the late 10th/early 11th century Andalusi physician and surgeon [[al-Zahrawi]], in explaining how to excise bladder stones, notes that the procedure is difficult for male doctors practicing on female patients: because of the need to touch the genitalia, the male practitioner must either find a female doctor who can perform the procedure, or a eunuch physician, or a midwife who takes instruction from the male surgeon.  In other words, even though direct evidence for female practitioners is rare, their existence can be inferred.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, "History of Science," ''Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures''.  Volume I: ''Methodologies, Paradigms and Sources'', Suad Joseph, general editor (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 2003), pp. 358-61; Peter Pormann, "Female Patients and Practitioners in Medieval Islam," ''The Lancet'' 373 (May 9, 2009), pp. 1598-99.&lt;/ref&gt;  As al-Zahrawi's example also suggests, midwives played an important role in the delivery of women's healthcare.  For these practitioners, there is more detailed information, both in terms of the prestige of their craft ([[ibn Khaldun]] calls it a noble craft, "something necessary in civilization") and in terms of biographical information on historic women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Giladi Avner | year = 2010 | title = Liminal Craft, Exceptional Law:  Preliminary Notes on Midwives in Medieval Islamic Writings | url = | journal = International Journal of Middle East Studies | volume = 42 | issue = 2| pages = 185–202 | doi=10.1017/s0020743810000012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Molénat, "Priviligiées ou poursuivies: quatre sages-femmes musulmanes dans la Castille du XVe siècle," ''Identidades marginales'', ed.

===Western medicine in China===
[[Traditional Chinese medicine]] based on the use of [[Chinese herbology|herbal medicine]], [[acupuncture]], [[Traditional Chinese massage|massage]] and other forms of therapy has been practiced in China for thousands of years.  However, Western Medicine was introduced to China in the 19th Century, mainly by medical missionaries sent from various Christian mission organizations, such as the [[London Missionary Society]] (Britain), the [[Methodism|Methodist]] Church (Britain) and the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States|Presbyterian Church]] (US). [[Benjamin Hobson]] (1816-1873), a medical missionary sent by the [[London Missionary Society]] in 1839, set up a highly successful Wai Ai Clinic (惠愛醫館) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ifeng.com/article/46027.html |title=回眸：当年传教士进羊城_MW悦读室之岭南话廊_凤凰博报- 博采众家之言 报闻公民心声-凤凰网 |publisher=Blog.ifeng.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mall.cnki.net/magazine/Article/GDSI199901009.htm |title=合信的《全体新论》与广东士林-《广东史志》1999年01期-中国知网 |publisher=Mall.cnki.net |date=2012-02-03 |accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Guangzhou, China. The [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] (香港華人西醫書院) was founded in 1887 by the [[London Missionary Society]], with its first graduate (in 1892) being [[Sun Yat-sen]] (孫中山).  Sun later led the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]], which changed China from an empire to a republic. The [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] was the forerunner of the School of Medicine of the [[University of Hong Kong]], which started in 1911.

Due to the social custom that men and women should not be near to one another, women of China were reluctant to be treated by Western male doctors. This resulted in a tremendous need for female doctors. One of these was [[Sigourney Trask]] of the Methodist Episcopal Church, who set-up a hospital in [[Fuzhou]] during the mid-19th century.

===Women's health movement in the 1970s===
The 1970s marked a great increase of women entering and graduating from [[medical school]]{{where|date=August 2015}}. From 1930 to 1970, a period of 40 years, about 14,000 women graduated from medical school. From 1970 to 1980, a period of 10 years, over 20,000 women graduated from medical school.&lt;ref&gt;Paludi, Michele A. and Gertrude A. Streuernage, ed., Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines (New York: Harrington Park Press, 1990), 236.&lt;/ref&gt; This increase of women in the medical field was due to both political and cultural changes.

Two laws in the United States lifted restrictions for women in the medical field -- [[Title IX]] of the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1972 and the [[Public Health Service Act]] of 1975, banning discrimination on grounds of gender. In November 1970, the Assembly of the Association of American Medical Colleges rallied for equal rights in the medical field.&lt;ref&gt;Paludi and Streuernage, ''Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines,'' 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, women's ideas about themselves and their relation to the medical field were shifting due to the [[women's movement]].

A sharp increase of women in the medical field led to developments in doctor patient relationships, changes in terminology and theory. One area of medical practice that was challenged and changed was [[gynecology]]. Wendy Kline &lt;ref&gt;Kline, Wendy. ''Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave'' (University of Chicago Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; talks about the blurring of "clinical" and "sexual" that occurred in the medical field in the late 40s into the 60s, particularly in gynecology. Kline says that "to ensure that young brides were ready for the wedding night, they [doctors] used the [[pelvic exam]] as a form of sex instruction ."&lt;ref&gt;Kline, ''Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave,'' p 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ellen Frankfort's book ''Vaginal Politics'', Frankfort talks about the "shame" and "humiliation" felt during a pap test; "I was naked, he was dressed; I was lying down, he was standing up; I was quiet, he was giving orders "&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, Ellen. ''Vaginal Politics'' (New York: Vintage, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

With higher numbers of women enrolled in medical school, medical practices like gynecology were challenged and changed.  One medical student is quoted in Kline's book as saying, "Since I experienced my own exams as a humiliating procedure, I feared inflicting the same humiliation on another person."&lt;ref&gt;Kline, ''Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972 the University of Iowa Medical School instituted a new training program for pelvic and breast examinations. Students would act both as the doctor and the patient, allowing each student to understand the procedure and create a more gentle, respectful examination. This method was quite different from the previous practice in which doctors were taught to assert their power over patients. With changes in ideologies and practices throughout the 70s, by 1980 over 75 schools had adopted this new method.&lt;ref&gt;Paludi and Streuernage, ''Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines,'' 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

With women entering the medical field and women's rights movements came also the women's health movement which sought alternative methods of health care for women. This came through the creation of self-help books, most notably ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]: A Book by and for Women''.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Women’s Health Book Collective Staff, ''Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book by and for Women'' (Boston: Simon and Schuster Trade, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; This book gave women a "manual" to help understand their body. It challenged hospital treatment, and doctors' practices. Aside from self-help books, many help centres were opened: birth centres run by [[midwives]], safe [[abortion]] centres, and classes for educating women on their bodies, all with the aim of providing non-judgmental, warm, and comfortable care for women.&lt;ref&gt;Schulman, Bruce J. The Seventies: The Great Shift in American Culture, Society, and politics. (Da Capo Press, 2002), 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Kline speaks to this claim women were taking on their body in relation to the medical world; women felt that "not only should women have access to information about their bodies... they should also help to create this knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Kline, Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The women's health movement, along with women involved in the medical field, opened the doors for research and awareness for female illness like [[breast cancer]] and [[cervical cancer]].

While scholars in the history of medicine had developed some study of women in the field—biographies of pioneering women physicians were common prior to the 1960s—the study of women in medicine took particular root with the advent of the [[women's movement]] in the 1960s, and in conjunction with the [[women's health movement]].  Two publications in 1973 were critical in establishing the women's health movement and scholarship about women in medicine: First, the publication of ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'' in 1973 by the Boston Women's Health Collective,&lt;ref&gt;''Our Bodies, Ourselves'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; and second, "Witches, Midwives, and Nurses: A History of Female Healers", a short paper by [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] and [[Deirdre English]] also in 1973.&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich-English-1973-Witches" /&gt; The Ehrenreich/English paper examined the history of women in medicine as the professionalization of the field excluded women, particularly [[midwifery|midwives]], from the practice.  Ehrenreich and English later expanded the work into a full-length book, ''[[For Her Own Good]]'', which connected the exclusion of women from the practice of medicine to [[sexism|sexist]] medical practices; this text and ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'' became key texts in the women's health movement. The English/Ehrenreich text laid out some early insights about the professionalization of medicine and the exclusion of women from the profession, and numerous scholars, such as [[Diana Elizabeth Long]], have greatly built upon and expanded this work.
