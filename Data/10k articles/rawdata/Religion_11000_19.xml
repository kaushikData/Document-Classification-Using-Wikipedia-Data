'''Abarimon''' or '''antipode''' is in [[mythology]] a people whose feet are turned backwards, but in spite of this handicap were able to run at great speed.

In Europe, this tribe was first described by [[Pliny the Elder]], in his book, ''Natural History'' (VII 11), who considered them to be native to [[India]]. A similar tale is recounted by [[Aulus Gellius]] in ''Attic Nights''.

They lived side by side with wild animals and attempts to capture them failed because they were so savage. Pliny refers to information that originates from [[Baiton]], which was [[Alexander the Great]]s Land Surveyor. Baiton says that the ''abarimons'' could only breathe the air in their own domestic valleys. Because of the special quality of air, which meant if it was breathed for a long period of time, it would be impossible to breathe any other type of air. Therefore the inhabitants were unable to leave the valley and live anywhere else. And so it was impossible to capture them and bring them to the courts of a distant ruler, or to the great Macedonian conquest. &lt;Ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder | Plinius]], '' [[Naturalis Historia]] ' '7, 11.&lt;/Ref&gt;

It is possible that this is an overly designed ethnographic description of an ancient wildlife strain in the areas near [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Tomaschek, RE I, 1, Sp. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another [[legend]], Abarimon is mentioned as a landscape in [[Scythia]], a valley of Mount Imaus, (which may be identical to [[Hindukush]] or the [[Himalayan Mountains]]).

Later, Abarimon has been briefly described in Thomas Cooper's ''Thesaurus Linguae Romanae et Britannicae'', as a tribe in the country '' Tataria ''. During the [[Middle Ages]], some mapdrawers, after a familiar [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] view, have made monsters in the form of Abarimon people and placed them at the outer border of the world.

'''Ahmed es-Sikeli''' ({{lang-ar|احمد السقيلي}}, '''Ahmed The [[Sicilian people|Sicilian]]'''), [[baptised]] a Christian under the name '''Peter''', was a eunuch and [[kaid]] of the [[Diwan (title)|Diwan]] of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] during the reign of [[William I of Sicily|William I]].  His story was recorded by his Christian contemporaries [[Romuald Guarna]] and [[Hugo Falcandus]] from Sicily and the Muslim historian [[Ibn Khaldun]].

Peter was born a Muslim in [[Djerba]] to a [[Berbers|Berberized]] [[Sicily|Sicilian]] family. After his conversion he entered the service of the Sicilian crown and rose to the rank of admiral in the navy. During the reconquest of [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger I]]'s "[[Kingdom of Africa]]" by the Muslims (1159), Peter led 160 ships in a raiding expedition to the Muslim-held [[Balearic Islands]]. He later tried to relieve besieged [[Mahdia]] in North Africa with the same fleet, but soon after engaging in battle he turned around and retreated towards Sicily. While Arabic sources credit a gale with dispersing the fleet, Hugo Falcandus asserts that Peter was "only in name and dress a Christian, and a [[Saracen]] at heart".  Falcandus' assertion can probably be discredited, at least with respect to this point in Peter's life, for the admiral did not fall out of favour at court. In fact, he was promoted to the office of [[Chamberlain (office)|Great Chamberlain]].

In 1162, Peter replaced the deceased Count [[Sylvester of Marsico]] in the triumvirate of officials—including [[Matthew of Ajello]] and [[Richard Palmer (archbishop)|Richard Palmer]]—in whom the king had confided the administration of the realm since the assassination of his prime minister, [[Maio of Bari]], in 1160. On her husband's death in 1166, the queen dowager [[Margaret of Navarre (1128–1183)|Margaret of Navarre]] assumed the regency for her young son [[William II of Sicily|William II]]. She trusted neither the nobility nor the church and so turned to the palatine officials and the triumvirs, of which she did not trust Matthew of Ajello. She promoted the chief eunuch, Peter, to the highest post in the kingdom, the one formerly held by Maio of Bari, but did not grant him the latter's title "emir of emirs" (''ammiratus ammiratorum'').

Peter was despised by the nobility and soon the Queen's cousin, [[Gilbert, Count of Gravina]], was plotting against his life. Unable either to keep control of Sicily or to control Gilbert, Peter initially strengthened his bodyguard and eventually absconded, taking with him a quantity of treasure and severely embarrassing the Queen-regent. Re-assuming his birth name of Ahmed and practising Islam, he crossed to Africa and became a captain of the fleet of the [[Almohad caliph]] [[Yusuf I, Almohad Caliph|Yusuf I]]. According to Ibn Khaldun, who calls him Ahmed ''es-Sikeli'' ("Ahmed the Sicilian"), he fought with valour against Christian foes.

'''''Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches''''' is a book composed by the American folklorist [[Charles Godfrey Leland]] that was published in 1899. It contains what he believed was the religious text of a group of [[paganism|pagan]] [[Witch-cult hypothesis|witches]] in [[Tuscany]], Italy that documented their beliefs and rituals, although various historians and folklorists have disputed the existence of such a group. In the 20th century, the book was very influential in the development of the [[Paganism (contemporary religions)|contemporary Pagan]] religion of [[Wicca]].

The text is a composite. Some of it is Leland's translation into English of an original Italian [[manuscript]], the ''Vangelo'' (gospel). Leland reported receiving the manuscript from his primary informant on Italian witchcraft beliefs, a woman Leland referred to as "Maddalena" and whom he called his "witch informant" in Italy. The rest of the material comes from Leland's research on [[Culture of Italy#Folklore|Italian folklore]] and traditions, including other related material from Maddalena. Leland had been informed of the ''Vangelo''{{'}}s existence in 1886, but it took Maddalena eleven years to provide him with a copy. After translating and editing the material, it took another two years for the book to be published. Its fifteen chapters portray the origins, beliefs, rituals, and spells of an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[paganism|pagan]] witchcraft tradition. The central figure of that religion is the [[goddess]] [[Aradia (goddess)|Aradia]], who came to Earth to teach the practice of witchcraft to peasants in order for them to oppose their [[feudalism|feudal]] oppressors and the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

Leland's work remained obscure until the 1950s, when other theories about, and claims of, "pagan witchcraft" survivals began to be widely discussed. ''Aradia'' began to be examined within the wider context of such claims. Scholars are divided, with some dismissing Leland's assertion regarding the origins of the manuscript, and others arguing for its authenticity as a unique documentation of folk beliefs. Along with increased scholarly attention, ''Aradia'' came to play a special role in the history of [[Gardnerian Wicca]] and its offshoots, being used as evidence that pagan witchcraft survivals existed in Europe, and because a passage from the book's first chapter was used as a part of the religion's [[liturgy]]. After the increase in interest in the text, it became widely available through numerous reprints from a variety of publishers, including a 1999 critical edition with a new translation by Mario and Dina Pazzaglini.

==Origins==
[[Image:Maddalena of Florence.jpg|thumb|left|"Maddalena" as a young [[fortune-telling|fortune-teller]]]]
[[Charles Godfrey Leland]] was an American author and [[folkloristics|folklorist]], and spent much of the 1890s in [[Florence]] researching Italian [[folklore]]. ''Aradia'' was one of the products of Leland's research. While Leland's name is the one principally associated with ''Aradia'', the manuscript that makes up the bulk of it is attributed to the research of an Italian woman whom Leland and Leland's biographer, his niece [[Elizabeth Robins Pennell]], referred to as "Maddalena". According to folklorist [[Roma Lister]], a contemporary and friend of Leland's, Maddalena's real name was Margherita, and she was a "[[witch]]" from Florence who claimed a family lineage from the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] and knowledge of ancient rituals.&lt;ref name="Lister"&gt;{{cite book | last=Lister | first=Roma | title=Reminiscences&amp;nbsp;— Social &amp; Political | year=1926 | publisher=Hutchinson &amp; Co. | location=London | pages=123–24 }} quoted in {{cite book | last=Mathiesen | first=Robert | editor=Mario Pazzaglini | title=Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches, A New Translation | year=1998 | publisher=Phoenix Publishing, Inc. | location=Blaine, Washington | isbn=0-919345-34-4 | chapter=Charles G. Leland and the Witches of Italy: The Origin of Aradia | page=25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Robert Mathiesen, as a contributor to the Pazzaglini translation of Aradia, mentions a letter from Maddalena to Leland, which he states is signed "Maddalena Talenti" (the last name being a guess, as the handwriting is difficult to decipher).&lt;ref name="Mathiesen32"&gt;{{cite book | last=Mathiesen | first=Robert | editor=Mario Pazzaglini | title=Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches, A New Translation | year=1998 | publisher=Phoenix Publishing, Inc. | location=Blaine, Washington | isbn=0-919345-34-4 | chapter=Charles G. Leland and the Witches of Italy: The Origin of Aradia | page=32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leland reports meeting Maddalena in 1886, and she became the primary source for his Italian folklore collecting for several years. Leland describes her as belonging to a vanishing tradition of [[magic (paranormal)|sorcery]].  He writes that "by long practice [she] has perfectly learned ... just what I want, and how to extract it from those of her kind."&lt;ref name="preface"&gt;{{cite book | author=Leland, Charles Godfrey | title=Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches | publisher =David Nutt | year=1899 | id= | url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Aradia%2C_or_the_Gospel_of_the_Witches | chapter =Preface }}&lt;/ref&gt; He received several hundred pages worth of material from her, which was incorporated into his books ''Etruscan Roman Remains in Popular Tradition'', ''Legends of Florence Collected From the People'', and eventually ''Aradia''. Leland wrote that he had "learned that there was in existence a manuscript setting forth the doctrines of Italian witchcraft" in 1886, and had urged Maddalena to find it.&lt;ref name="appendix"&gt;{{cite book | author=Leland, Charles Godfrey | title=Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches | publisher =David Nutt | year=1899 | id= | url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Aradia%2C_or_the_Gospel_of_the_Witches | chapter=Appendix }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven years later, on 1 January 1897, Leland received the ''Vangelo'' by post. The manuscript was written in Maddalena's handwriting. Leland understood it to be an authentic document&lt;ref name="Mathiesen35"&gt;Mathiesen, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; of the "Old Religion" of the witches, but explains that he did not know if the text came from written or oral sources.&lt;ref name ="preface" /&gt;

Leland's translation and editing was completed in early 1897 and submitted to David Nutt for publication. Two years passed, until Leland wrote requesting the return of the manuscript in order to submit it to a different publishing house. This request spurred Nutt to accept the book, and it was published in July 1899 in a small print run.&lt;ref name= "Clifton73"&gt;{{cite book | last=Clifton | first=Chas | editor=Mario Pazzaglini | title=Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches, A New Translation | year=1998 | publisher=Phoenix Publishing, Inc. | location=Blaine, Washington | isbn= 0-919345-34-4 | chapter=The Significance of Aradia | page=73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wiccan author [[Raymond Buckland]] claims to have been the first to reprint the book in 1968 through his "Buckland Museum of Witchcraft" press,&lt;ref name= "Buckland"&gt;[[Raymond Buckland|Buckland, Raymond]], quoted in Clifton, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; but a British reprint was made by "Wiccens"{{sic}} Charles "Rex Nemorensis" and Mary Cardell in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="Hutton298"&gt;{{cite book | first=Ronald | last=Hutton | authorlink=Ronald Hutton  | title=Triumph of the Moon | publisher =Oxford University Press | year=2000 | isbn=0-500-27242-5 |page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the text has been repeatedly reprinted by a variety of different publishers, including as a 1998 retranslation by Mario and Dina Pazzaglini with essays and commentary.

==Contents==
{{wikisource}}
After the eleven-year search, Leland writes that he was unsurprised by the contents of the ''Vangelo''. It was largely what he was expecting, with the exception that he did not predict passages in "prose-poetry".&lt;ref name="appendix" /&gt; "I also believe that in this Gospel of the Witches", comments Leland in the appendix, "we have a trustworthy outline at least of the doctrine and rites observed at [the [[sabbath (witchcraft)|witches' Sabbat]]]. They adored forbidden deities and practised forbidden deeds, inspired as much by [[rebellion]] against Society as by their own passions."&lt;ref name="appendix" /&gt;

Leland's final draft was a slim volume. He organised the material to be included into fifteen chapters, and added a brief preface and an appendix. The published version also included footnotes and, in many places, the original Italian that Leland had translated. Most of the content of Leland's ''Aradia'' is made up of [[magic (paranormal)|spells]], blessings, and rituals, but the text also contains stories and [[mythology|myths]] which suggest influences from both the ancient [[Roman mythology|Roman religion]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. Major characters in the myths include [[Diana (mythology)|the Roman goddess Diana]], a [[solar deity|sun god]] called [[Lucifer]], the Biblical [[Cain]] as a [[lunar deity|lunar figure]], and the [[messiah|messianic]] [[Aradia (goddess)|Aradia]]. The witchcraft of "The Gospel of the Witches" is both a method for casting spells and an anti-hierarchical "counter-religion" to the Catholic church.&lt;ref name="Mathiesen50"&gt;Mathiesen, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Themes===
[[Image:Boucher Diane sortant du bain Louvre 2712.jpg|thumb|[[François Boucher]]'s nude ''Diana Leaving Her Bath''.  The goddess is wearing a crescent moon crown.]]
Entire chapters of Aradia are devoted to rituals and magic spells. These include enchantments to win love (Chapter VI), a conjuration to perform when finding a stone with a hole or a round stone in order to turn it into an [[amulet]] for Diana's favour (Chapter IV), and the consecration of a ritual feast for Diana, Aradia, and Cain (Chapter II).  The narrative material makes up less of the text, and is composed of short stories and legends about the birth of the witchcraft religion and the actions of their gods. Leland summarises the mythic material in the book in its appendix, writing "Diana is Queen of the Witches; an associate of [[Herodias]] (Aradia) in her relations to sorcery; that she bore a child to [[solar deity|her brother the Sun]] (here Lucifer); that as a [[lunar deity|moon-goddess]] she is in some relation to Cain, who dwells as prisoner in the moon, and that the witches of old were people oppressed by [[feudalism|feudal]] lands, the former revenging themselves in every way, and holding [[orgy|orgies]] to Diana which the Church represented as being the worship of [[Satan]]".&lt;ref name="appendix" /&gt; Diana is not only the witches' goddess, but is presented as the [[creator deity|primordial creatrix]] in Chapter III, dividing herself into darkness and light. After giving birth to Lucifer, Diana seduces him while in the form of a cat, eventually giving birth to Aradia, their daughter. Diana demonstrates the power of her witchcraft by creating "the heavens, the stars and the rain", becoming "Queen of the Witches". Chapter I presents the original witches as slaves that escaped from their masters, beginning new lives as "thieves and evil folk". Diana sends her daughter Aradia to them to teach these former serfs witchcraft, the power of which they can use to "destroy the evil race (of oppressors)".  Aradia's students thus became the first witches, who would then continue the worship of Diana.  Leland was struck by this [[cosmogony]]: "In all other Scriptures of all races, it is the male ... who creates the universe; in Witch Sorcery it is the female who is the primitive principle".&lt;ref name= "appendix" /&gt;

===Structure===
''Aradia'' is composed of fifteen chapters, the first ten of which are presented as being Leland's translation of the ''Vangelo'' [[manuscript]] given to him by Maddalena. This section, while predominantly made up of spells and rituals, is also the source of most of the myths and folktales contained in the text. At the end of Chapter I is the text in which Aradia gives instructions to her followers on how to practice witchcraft.

The first ten chapters are not entirely a direct translation of the ''Vangelo''; Leland offers his own commentary and notes on a number of passages, and Chapter VII is Leland's incorporation of other Italian folklore material. [[Medievalism|Medievalist]] Robert Mathiesen contends that the ''Vangelo'' manuscript actually represents even less of ''Aradia'', arguing that only Chapters I, II, and the first half of Chapter IV match Leland's description of the manuscript's contents, and suggests that the other material came from different texts collected by Leland through Maddalena.&lt;ref name="Mathiesen37"&gt;Mathiesen, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining five chapters are clearly identified in the text as representing other material Leland believed to be relevant to the ''Vangelo'', acquired during his research into Italian witchcraft, and especially while working on his ''Etruscan Roman Remains'' and ''Legends of Florence''. The themes in these additional chapters vary in some details from the first ten, and Leland included them partly to "[confirm] the fact that the worship of Diana existed for a long time contemporary with [[Early Christianity|Christianity]]".&lt;ref name="ChapterXI"&gt;Leland, [[wikisource:Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches/Chapter XI|Chapter XI]]&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter XV, for example, gives an [[incantation]] to [[Laverna]], through the use of a deck of [[playing card]]s. Leland explains its inclusion by a note that Diana, as portrayed in ''Aradia'', is worshipped by outlaws, and Laverna was the Roman goddess of thievery.&lt;ref name="ChapterXV"&gt;Leland, [[wikisource:Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches /Chapter XV|Chapter XV]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of Leland's thoughts about the text are given in the book's preface, appendix, and numerous footnotes.

In several places Leland provides the Italian he was translating. According to Mario Pazzaglini, author of the 1999 translation, the Italian contains misspellings, missing words, and grammatical errors, and is in a standardised Italian rather than the [[Regional Italian|local dialect]] one might expect.&lt;ref name="Pazzaglini"&gt;{{cite book | last=Pazzaglini | first=Mario | title=Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches, A New Translation | year=1998 | publisher=Phoenix Publishing, Inc. | location=Blaine, Washington | isbn=0-919345-34-4 | pages=84–85 | chapter=Leland and the Magical World of Aradia }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pazzaglini concludes that ''Aradia'' represents material translated from dialect to basic Italian and then into English,&lt;ref name="Pazzaglini" /&gt; creating a summary of texts, some of which were mis-recorded.&lt;ref name="Pazzaglini92"&gt;Pazzaglini, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Leland himself called the text a "collection of ceremonies, 'cantrips,' incantations, and traditions"&lt;ref name="appendix" /&gt; and described it as an attempt to gather material, "valuable and curious remains of [[Ancient Rome|ancient Latin]] or Etruscan lore"&lt;ref name="appendix" /&gt; that he feared would be lost. There is no cohesive narrative even in the sections that Leland attributes to the ''Vangelo''. This lack of cohesion, or "inconsistency", is an argument for the text's authenticity, according to religious scholar [[Chas S. Clifton]], since the text shows no signs of being "massaged ... for future book buyers."&lt;ref name="Clifton70"&gt;Clifton, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims questioned==
[[Image:Charles Godfrey Leland portrait.jpg|thumb|Charles Godfrey Leland wrote journalism, comedy and books on folklore and linguistics. ''Aradia'' has proved the most controversial.]]
Leland wrote that "the witches even yet form a fragmentary secret society or sect, that they call it that of the Old Religion, and that there are in the [[Romagna]] entire villages in which the people are completely heathen".&lt;ref name="appendix" /&gt; Accepting this, Leland supposed that "the existence of a religion supposes a Scripture, and in this case it may be admitted, almost without severe verification, that the Evangel of the Witches is really a very old work ... in all probability the translation of some early or later [[Latin]] work."&lt;ref name= "appendix" /&gt;

Leland's claim that the manuscript was genuine, and even his assertion that he received such a manuscript, have been called into question.  After the 1921 publication of [[Margaret Murray]]'s ''The Witch-cult in Western Europe'', which hypothesised that the European [[witch-hunt|witch trials]] were actually a persecution of a pagan religious survival, American sensationalist author Theda Kenyon's 1929 book ''Witches Still Live'' connected Murray's thesis with the witchcraft religion in ''Aradia''.&lt;ref name = "Kenyon"&gt;Hutton, 2000, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Clifton 62"&gt;Clifton, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments against Murray's thesis would eventually include arguments against Leland. Witchcraft scholar [[Jeffrey Burton Russell|Jeffrey Russell]] devoted some of his 1980 book ''A History of Witchcraft: Sorcerers, Heretics and Pagans'' to arguing against the claims in ''Aradia'', Murray's thesis, and [[Jules Michelet]]'s 1862 ''La Sorcière'', which also theorised that witchcraft represented an underground religion.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite book | first= Jeffrey | last=Russell | authorlink=Jeffrey Burton Russell | title=A History of Witchcraft: Sorcerers, Heretics and Pagans | publisher =Thames and Hudson | year=1982 | isbn=0-19-820744-1| page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Elliot Rose's ''A Razor for a Goat'' dismissed ''Aradia'' as a collection of incantations unsuccessfully attempting to portray a religion.&lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;{{cite book | first=Elliot | last=Rose | title=A Razor for a Goat | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year=1962|pages=148–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Triumph of the Moon'', historian [[Ronald Hutton]] summarises the controversy as having three possible extremes:

# The ''Vangelo'' manuscript represents a genuine text from an otherwise undiscovered religion.
# Maddalena wrote the text, either with or without Leland's assistance, possibly drawing from her own background with folklore or witchcraft.
# The entire document was forged by Leland.

Hutton himself is a sceptic, not only of the existence of the religion that ''Aradia'' claims to represent,&lt;ref name= "Hutton145"&gt;Hutton, 2000, pp. 145–148.&lt;/ref&gt; but also of the existence of Maddalena, arguing that it is more likely that Leland created the entire story than that Leland could be so easily "duped" by an Italian fortune-teller.&lt;ref name="Hutton301"&gt;{{cite book | first=Ronald | last=Hutton | authorlink=Ronald Hutton | title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy | publisher =Oxford University Press | year=1991 |page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clifton takes exception to Hutton's position, writing that it amounts to an accusation of "serious literary fraud" made by an "[[argument from ignorance|argument from absence]]";&lt;ref name="Clifton67"&gt;Clifton, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; one of Hutton's main objections is that ''Aradia'' is unlike anything found in [[medieval literature]].&lt;ref name="Hutton145" /&gt;

Mathiesen also dismisses this "option three", arguing that while Leland's English drafts for the book were heavily edited and revised in the process of writing, the Italian sections, in contrast, were almost untouched except for corrections of "precisely the sort that a proofreader would make as he compared his copy to the original".&lt;ref name= "Mathiesen39"&gt;Mathiesen, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; This leads Mathiesen to conclude that Leland was working from an extant Italian-language original that he describes as "authentic, but not representative" of any larger folk tradition.&lt;ref name="Mathiesen50" /&gt; [[Anthropology|Anthropologist]] [[Sabina Magliocco]] examines the "option one" possibility, that Leland's manuscript represented a folk tradition involving Diana and the [[Cult of Herodias]], in her article ''Who Was Aradia? The History and Development of a Legend''. Magliocco writes that ''Aradia'' "may represent a 19th-century version of [the legend of the Cult of Herodias] that incorporated later materials influenced by medieval [[Satanism|diabolism]]: the presence of 'Lucifero,' the Christian devil; the practice of sorcery; the naked dances under the full moon."&lt;ref name= "Magliocco2002"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Magliocco, Sabina | title=Who Was Aradia?

==Influence on Wicca and Stregheria==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Wicca]] --&gt;
Magliocco calls ''Aradia'' "the first real text of the 20th century Witchcraft revival",&lt;ref name= "Magliocco1999"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Magliocco, Sabina | title=Book Review: The New Edition of Leland's ''Aradia'' | journal=Pomegranate: the Journal of Pagan Studies | year=1999 | volume=9 | url= http://chass.colostate-pueblo.edu/natrel/pom/old/POM9a2.html  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070823193719/http://chass.colostate-pueblo.edu/natrel/pom/old/POM9a2.html |archivedate = 2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is repeatedly cited as being profoundly influential on the development of [[Wicca]]. The text apparently corroborates the thesis of Margaret Murray that [[Early modern Europe|early modern]] and [[Renaissance]] witchcraft represented a survival of ancient pagan beliefs, and after [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]]'s claim to have encountered religious witchcraft in 20th-century England,&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gardner | first=Gerald | authorlink=Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|title= [[Witchcraft Today]] | year =1954 | publisher=Citadel Press | id=ASIN B0007EAR5W }}&lt;/ref&gt; the works of Michelet, Murray, and Leland helped support at least the possibility that such a survival could exist.&lt;ref name= "Clifton75"&gt;Clifton, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Charge of the Goddess]], an important piece of liturgy used in Wiccan rituals,&lt;ref name="Clifton60"&gt;Clifton, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; was inspired by Aradia's speech in the first chapter of the book. Parts of the speech appeared in an early version of Gardnerian Wicca ritual.&lt;ref name="Serith"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Serith, Ceisiwr | title=The Sources of the Charge of the Goddess | journal=Enchanté | volume=21|pages=21–25| url= http://www.ceisiwrserith.com/wicca/charge.htm }} cited in Clifton, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Doreen Valiente]], one of Gardner's priestesses, Gardner was surprised by Valiente's recognising the material as having come from Leland's book.  Valiente subsequently rewrote the passage in both prose and verse, retaining the "traditional" ''Aradia'' lines.&lt;ref name="Valiente73"&gt;[[Doreen Valiente|Valiente, Doreen]], quoted in Clifton, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[Wicca#Wiccan traditions|Wiccan traditions]] use the name ''Aradia'', or ''Diana'', to refer to the Goddess or Queen of the Witches, and Hutton writes that the earliest Gardnerian rituals used the name ''Airdia'', a "garbled" form of ''Aradia''.&lt;ref name="Hutton234"&gt;Hutton, 2000, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton further suggests that the reason that Wicca includes [[Skyclad (neopaganism)|skyclad]] practice, or ritual nudity, is because of a line spoken by Aradia:&lt;ref name="Hutton225"&gt;Hutton, 2000, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

:And as the sign that ye are truly free,
:Ye shall be naked in your rites, both men
:And women also: this shall last until
:The last of your oppressors shall be dead;&lt;ref&gt;Leland, [[wikisource:Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches/Chapter I|Chapter I]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Accepting ''Aradia'' as the source of this practice, Robert Chartowich points to the 1998 Pazzaglini translation of these lines, which read "Men and Women / You will all be naked, until / Yet he shall be dead, the last / Of your oppressors is dead."  Chartowich argues that the ritual nudity of Wicca was based upon Leland's mistranslation of these lines by incorporating the clause "in your rites".&lt;ref name="Chartowich"&gt;{{cite book | last=Chartowich | first= Robert | editor=Mario Pazzaglini | title=Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches, A New Translation | year=1998 | publisher= Phoenix Publishing, Inc. | location=Blaine, Washington | isbn=0-919345-34-4 | chapter= Enigmas of Aradia | page=453 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, earlier mentions of ritual nudity among Italian witches. Historian Ruth Martin states that it was a common practice for witches of Italy to be "naked with their hair loose around their shoulders" while reciting conjurations.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ruth. ''Witchcraft and the Inquisition in Venice, 1550-1650''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeffrey Burton Russell]] notes that "A woman named Marta was tortured in Florence about 1375: she was alleged to have placed candles round a dish and to have taken off her clothes and stood above the dish in the nude, making magical signs".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey Burton Russell|Russel, J. B.]]. ''Witchcraft in the Middle Ages''.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Franco Mormando refers to an Italian witch: "Lo and behold: in the first hours of sleep, this woman opens the door to her vegetable garden and comes out completely naked and her hair all undone, and she begins to do and say her various signs and conjurations ...".&lt;ref&gt;Mormando, Franco. ''The Preacher's Demons''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reception of ''Aradia'' amongst Neopagans has not been entirely positive. Clifton suggests that modern claims of revealing an Italian pagan witchcraft tradition, for example those of [[Leo Martello]] and [[Raven Grimassi]], must be "match[ed] against", and compared with the claims in ''Aradia''. He further suggests that a lack of comfort with ''Aradia'' may be due to an "insecurity" within Neopaganism about the movement's claim to authenticity as a religious revival.&lt;ref name= "Clifton61"&gt;Clifton, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Valiente offers another explanation for the negative reaction of some neopagans; that the identification of [[Lucifer]] as the God of the witches in ''Aradia'' was "too strong meat" for Wiccans who were used to the gentler, romantic paganism of Gerald Gardner and were especially quick to reject any relationship between witchcraft and [[Satanism]].&lt;ref name="Valiente61"&gt;[[Doreen Valiente|Valiente, Doreen]], quoted in Clifton, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clifton writes that ''Aradia'' was especially influential for leaders of the Wiccan religious movement in the 1950s and 1960s, but that the book no longer appears on the "reading lists" given by members to newcomers, nor is it extensively cited in more recent Neopagan books.&lt;ref name= "Clifton71"&gt;Clifton, pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; The new translation of the book released in 1998 was introduced by Wiccan author [[Stewart Farrar]], who affirms the importance of ''Aradia'', writing that "Leland's gifted research into a 'dying' tradition has made a significant contribution to a living and growing one."&lt;ref name="Farrar"&gt;{{cite book | last=Farrar | first=Stewart | authorlink=Stewart Farrar | editor=Mario Pazzaglini | title=Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches, A New Translation | year=1998 | publisher= Phoenix Publishing, Inc. | location=Blaine, Washington | isbn=0-919345-34-4 | chapter=Foreword | page=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Raven Grimassi]] has written extensively about Aradia in his popularization of [[Stregheria]], presenting what he admits is his own personal rendering of her story. He differs from Leland in many ways, particularly in portraying her as a witch who lived and taught in 14th-century Italy, rather than a goddess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grimassi |first=Raven |authorlink=Raven Grimassi |title=Italian Witchcraft: The Old Religion of Southern Europe |year=2000 |publisher=Llewellyn Publications |isbn=978-1-56718-259-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grimassi |first=Raven |authorlink=Raven Grimassi |title=Hereditary Witchcraft: Secrets of the Old Religion |year=1999 |publisher=Llewellyn Publications |isbn=978-1-56718-256-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In response to Clifton, he states that similarity or dissimilarity to Leland's Aradia material cannot be a measure of authenticity, since Leland's material itself is disputed.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore it cannot effectively be used to discredit other writings or views on Italian witchcraft, nor is it a representative ethnographic foundation against which other writings or views "must" be compared.  The Aradia material is, unfortunately, a disputed text with problems of its own when compared to the usually accepted folklore, folk traditions, and folk magic practices of Italy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He agrees with Valiente that the major objection of Neopagans to this material is its "inclusion of negative stereotypes related to witches and witchcraft", and suggests that comparisons between this material and religious witchcraft are "regarded as an insult by many neo-pagans".&lt;ref&gt;Grimassi, Raven ''[http://www.stregheria.com/criticscorner.htm A BIRD'S EYE VIEW: Rebuttals by Raven Grimassi]''. Retrieved 2008-03-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence on culture ==
===Classical Music===
The Norwegian classical [[composer]] [[Martin Romberg]] wrote a [[Mass (music)|Mass]] for [[mixed choir]] in seven parts after a selection of poems from Leland's text. This ''Witch Mass'' was premiered at the Vestfold International Festival in 2012 with [[Grex Vocalis]]. In order to create the right atmosphere for the music, the festival blocked of an entire road tunnel in [[Tønsberg]] to use it as a venue. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tb.no/kultur/ticker/kultur/tunnelen-blir-konsertarena/s/2-2.516-1.7178211|title= Report from the planning of the concert|publisher= tb.no.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was released on CD through Lawo Classics in 2014. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.challengerecords.com/products/14482758027365/|title=Witch Mass on CD|publisher= challengerecords.com.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ateliers d'Art Sacré''' (Studios of Sacred Art) was an artistic movement based in Paris in the first half of the 20th century that aimed to create church art that avoided the artificiality of traditional academic or realist work.

==Foundation==

The Ateliers d'Art Sacré were founded on 5 November 1919 after [[World War I]] (1914-18) by [[Maurice Denis]] (1870–1943) and [[Georges Desvallières]] (1861–1950) as part of a broad movement in Europe to reconcile the church with modern civilization.{{sfn|Rinuy|2002}}
Their aim was to train artists and crafts people in the practice of Christian art and to provide tasteful religious works of traditional and modern style to churches, particularly those that had been devastated by the war.{{sfn|Lebée|2014}}
Denis said that he was against academic art because it sacrificed emotion to convention and artifice, and was against realism because it was prose and he wanted music. Above all he wanted beauty, which was an attribute of divinity.{{sfn|Rossi|2010}}

==Activities==

The artists were largely involved in decoration of the [[Église Saint-Esprit (Paris)|Église Saint-Esprit]] in Paris, where the iconography shows the milestones in church history.
In this church, built in 1928-35 by the architect [[Paul Tournon]], murals were painted by forty artists including Maurice Denis, Georges Desvallières, [[Henri Marret]], Jean Dupa, Pauline Peugniez and  [[Robert Poughéon]].
In the Way of the Cross of Saint-Michel de Picpus, decorated in 1934 under the direction of Henri de Maistre, the personality of the artists was effaced for the sake of the collaborative work.{{sfn|Lebée|2014}}
The number of church commissions for the Ateliers was not enough for them to survive.{{sfn|Rossi|2010}}

The Dominican [[Marie-Alain Couturier]] (1897–1954) was a member of the Ateliers. 
He argued that a masterpiece, even if made by a non-believer, would always be more effective than a religious work of lesser value.{{sfn|Dekoninck|Trémolières|2010|p=9}}
He gradually moved away from the influence of Maurice Denis, his master, and developed an admiration for [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]].{{sfn|Rossi|2010}}
The Canadian painter [[Jean Dallaire]] (1916–1965) was another artist who joined the Ateliers, but then became interested in Picasso and the surrealists.{{sfn|Jean Dallaire, Musée des beaux-arts du Canada}}

[[File:God the Geometer.jpg|thumb|250px|God creating the cosmos (''[[Bible moralisée]]'', French, 13th century)]]
'''Biblical cosmology''' is the [[authorship of the Bible|biblical writers]]' conception of the [[cosmos]] as an organised, structured entity, including its [[Cosmogony|origin]], [[Cosmography|order]], [[Moral universe|meaning]] and [[Eschatology|destiny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|2003|p= 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knight|1990|p= 175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible was [[Biblical canon|formed over many centuries]], involving [[Authorship of the Bible|many authors]], and reflects [[Internal consistency of the Bible|shifting patterns of religious belief]]; consequently, its [[Religious cosmology|cosmology]] is not always consistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|1996|p= 134}}: "The canon of the Hebrew Bible [...] was formed of [...] diverse writings composed by many men or women over a long period of time, under many different circumstances, and in the light of shifting patterns of religious belief and practice. [...] Indeed, the questions under investigation in this book concerning the end of an individual's life, the nature of death, the possibility of divine judgment, and the resultant reward or punishment [...] are simply too crucial to have attracted a single solution unanimously accepted over the near millennium of biblical composition."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berlin 2011 188"&gt;{{harvnb|Berlin|2011|p= 188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor do the biblical texts necessarily represent the beliefs of all [[Jews]] or [[Christians]] at the time they were put into writing: the majority of those making up [[Hebrew Bible]] or [[Old Testament]] in particular represent the beliefs of only a small segment of the ancient Israelite community, the members of a late Judean religious tradition centered in [[Jerusalem#Ancient period|Jerusalem]] and devoted to the exclusive worship of [[Yahweh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2002|p=52}}: "The religious ideology promoted in a majority of the texts that now form the Hebrew Bible represent the beliefs of only a small portion of the ancient Israelite community: the late Judean individuals who collected, edited, and transmitted the biblical materials were, for the most part, members of a religious tradition centered in Jerusalem that worshipped the god Yahweh exclusively."&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Israelites envisaged a universe made up of a [[Flat Earth|flat disc-shaped earth]] floating on water, [[heaven]] above, [[underworld]] below.&lt;ref name="Aune2003p119"/&gt; Humans inhabited earth during life and the underworld after death, and the underworld was morally neutral;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2002|pp=117,124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; only in [[Hellenistic]] times (after c.330 BCE) did Jews begin to adopt the [[Hades|Greek idea]] that it would be a place of punishment for misdeeds, and that the righteous would enjoy an [[afterlife]] in heaven.&lt;ref name="Lee 2010 77–78"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2010|pp=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this period too the older three-level cosmology in large measure gave way to the Greek concept of a [[spherical earth]] suspended in [[space]] at the [[geocentric|center]] of a number of [[Celestial spheres|concentric heavens]].&lt;ref name="Aune2003p119"&gt;{{harvnb|Aune|2003|p=119}}: "During the Hellenistic period a geocentric model of the universe largely replaced the older three-tiered universe model, for Greek thinkers (such as Aristotle and Eratosthenes) proposed that the earth was a sphere suspended freely in space."&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening words of the [[Genesis creation narrative]] (Genesis 1:1-26) sum up a view of how the cosmos originated: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth"; [[Yahweh]], the God of Israel, was solely responsible for creation and had no rivals.&lt;ref name="Wright_2002 53"&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2002|p=53}}: "Biblical texts from all historical periods and a variety of literary genres demonstrate that in Yahwistic circles, that is, among people who worshipped Yahweh as the chief god, God was always understood as the one who alone created heaven, earth, and all that is in them. [...] Yahweh, the Israelite god, had no rivals, and in a world where nations claimed that their gods were the supreme beings in the universe and that all others were subject to them, the Israelites' claim for the superiority of Yahweh enabled them to imagine that no other nation could rival her [...]. Phrases such as 'Yahweh, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth' [...] and related phrases for Yahweh as creator and almighty master of the cosmos have parallels in earlier Canaanite terminology for the god El. [...] In fact, the Israelites did not create these phrases but inherited them from earlier Canaanite civilizations. Moreover, later editors of the Hebrew Bible used them to serve their particular monotheistic theology: their god is the supreme god, and he alone created the universe."
&lt;/ref&gt;
Later Jewish thinkers, adopting ideas from Greek philosophy, concluded that [[Wisdom of God|God's Wisdom]], [[Logos|Word]] and [[Holy Spirit (Judaism)|Spirit]] penetrated all things and gave them unity.&lt;ref name="Kaiser 1997 28"&gt;{{harvnb|Kaiser|1997|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christianity in turn adopted these ideas and identified [[Jesus]] with the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos (Word)]]: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" ([[John 1:1]]).&lt;ref name="Parrish 1990 183–184"&gt;{{harvnb|Parrish|1990|pp=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two different models of the process of creation existed in ancient Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fishbane|2003|pp=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the "[[logos]]" (speech) model, God speaks and shapes unresisting dormant matter into effective existence and order (Psalm 33: "By the word of YHWH the heavens were made, and by the breath of his mouth all their hosts; he gathers up the waters like a mound, stores the Deep in vaults"); in the second, or "[[agon]]" (struggle) model, God does battle with the monsters of the sea at the beginning of the world in order to mark his sovereignty and power.&lt;ref name="Fishbane2003p34-35"&gt;{{harvnb|Fishbane|2003|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psalm 74 evokes the agon model: it opens with a lament over God's desertion of his people and their tribulations, then asks him to remember his past deeds: "You it was who smashed Sea with your might, who battered the heads of the monsters in the waters; You it was who crushed the heads of Leviathan, who left them for food for the denizens of the desert..."&lt;ref name="Fishbane2003p34-35"/&gt; In this world-view the seas are primordial forces of disorder, and the work of creation is preceded by a divine combat (or "[[theomachy]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fishbane|2003|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creation in the "agon" model takes the following storyline: (1) God as the divine warrior battles the monsters of [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]], who include [[Yam (god)|Sea]], [[Mot (Semitic god)|Death]], [[Tannin (demon)|Tannin]] and [[Leviathan]]; (2)  The world of nature joins in the battle and the chaos-monsters are defeated; (3) [[Throne of God|God is enthroned]] on a divine mountain, surrounded by lesser deities; (4) He speaks, and nature brings forth the created world,&lt;ref name="Aune2003p118"&gt;{{harvnb|Aune|2003|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for the Greeks, the [[cosmos]]. This myth was taken up in later Jewish and Christian [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] literature and [[Eschatology|projected into the future]], so that cosmic battle becomes the decisive act at the end of the world's history:&lt;ref name="Aune2003p118"/&gt; thus the [[Book of Revelation]] (end of the 1st century CE) tells how, after the God's final victory over the sea-monsters, [[New Heavens and New Earth]] shall be inaugurated in a cosmos in which there will be "no more sea" (Revelation 21:1).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mabie|2008|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Genesis creation narrative]] (Genesis 1) is the quintessential "logos" creation myth. Like the "agon" model it begins with darkness and the uncreated [[primordial ocean]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mabie|2008|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; God separates and restrains the waters, but he does not [[Ex nihilo|create them from nothing]].&lt;ref name="Berlin 2011 189"&gt;{{harvnb|Berlin|2011|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; God initiates each creative act with a spoken word ("God said, Let there be..."), and finalises it with the giving of a name.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=190}} Creation by speech is not unique to the Old Testament: it is prominent in some [[Egyptian mythology#Cosmology|Egyptian traditions]].{{sfn|Walton|2011|p=}} There is, however, a difference between the Egyptian and Hebrew logos mythologies: in Genesis 1 the divine word of the [[Elohim]] is an act of "making into"; the word of Egyptian creator-god, by contrast, is an almost magical activation of something inherent in pre-creation: as such, it goes beyond the concept of fiat (divine act) to something more like the [[John 1:1|Logos of the Gospel of John]].{{sfn|Walton|2011|p=}}

=== Naming: God, Wisdom, Torah and Christ ===
In the ancient world, things did not exist until they were named: "The name of a living being or an object was ... the very essence of what was defined, and the pronouncing of a name was to create what was spoken."{{sfn|Walton|2011|p=}} The pre-Exilic (before 586 BCE) Old Testament allowed no equals to Yahweh in heaven, despite the continued existence of an [[Heavenly host|assembly of subordinate servant-deities]] who helped make decisions about matters on heaven and earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Page Lee|1990|pp=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The post-Exilic writers of the [[Wisdom]] tradition (e.g. the [[Book of Proverbs]], [[Song of Songs]], etc.) develop the idea that Wisdom, later identified with [[Torah]], existed before creation and was used by God to create the universe:&lt;ref name="Berlin 2011 188"/&gt; "Present from the beginning, Wisdom assumes the role of master builder while God establishes the heavens, restricts the chaotic waters, and shapes the mountains and fields."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parrish|1990|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borrowing ideas from Greek philosophers who held that reason bound the universe together, the Wisdom tradition taught that God's Wisdom, Word and Spirit were the ground of cosmic unity.&lt;ref name="Kaiser 1997 28"/&gt; Christianity in turn adopted these ideas and applied them to Jesus: the [[Epistle to the Colossians]] calls Jesus "...image of the invisible God, first-born of all creation...", while the [[Gospel of John]] identifies him with the creative word ("In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God").&lt;ref name="Parrish 1990 183–184"/&gt;

== Cosmography (shape and structure of the cosmos) ==
[[File:Early Hebrew Conception of the Universe.png|thumb|right|300px| The Old Testament cosmos.]]
{{See also|Cosmography|Christian mythology}}

===Heavens, earth, and underworld===
The [[Hebrew Bible]] depicted a three-part world, with the heavens (''[[shamayim]]'') above, earth (''eres'') in the middle, and the underworld (''[[sheol]]'') below.{{sfn|Wright|2002|p=54}} After the 4th century BCE this was gradually replaced by a Greek scientific cosmology of a spherical earth surrounded by multiple concentric heavens.&lt;ref name="Aune2003p119"/&gt;

=== The cosmic ocean ===
The three-part world of heavens, earth and underworld floated in ''[[Tehom]]'', the mythological cosmic ocean, which covered the earth until God created the [[firmament]] to divide it into upper and lower portions and reveal the dry land;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ringgren|1990|pp=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; the world has been protected from the cosmic ocean ever since by the solid dome of the firmament.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ryken et al|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''tehom'' is, or was, hostile to God: it confronted him at the beginning of the world (Psalm 104:6ff) but fled from the dry land at his rebuke; he has now set a boundary or bar for it which it can no longer pass (Jeremiah 5:22 and Job 38:8-10).&lt;ref name="Ringgren1990p92"&gt;{{harvnb|Ringgren|1990|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cosmic sea is the home of monsters which God conquers: "By his power he stilled the sea, by his understanding he smote Rahab!" (Job 26:12f).&lt;ref name="Ringgren1990p92"/&gt; (Rahab is an exclusively Hebrew sea-monster; others, including [[Leviathan]] and the ''tannin'', or dragons, are found in [[Ugarit]]ic texts; it is not entirely clear whether they are identical with Sea or are Sea's helpers).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ringgren|1990|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "bronze sea" which stood in the forecourt of the Temple in Jerusalem probably corresponds to the "sea" in Babylonian temples, representing the ''[[apsu]]'', the cosmic ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ringgren|1990|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the New Testament Jesus' conquest of the stormy sea shows the conquering deity overwhelming the forces of chaos: a mere word of command from the [[Son of God]] stills the foe (Mark 4:35-41), who then tramples over his enemy, ([[Jesus walking on water]] - Mark 6:45, 47-51).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wyatt|2001|pp=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], where the [[Archangel Michael]] expels the dragon ([[Satan]]) from heaven ("And war broke out in heaven, with Michael and his angels attacking the dragon..." - Revelation 12:7), the motif can be traced back to Leviathan in Israel and to Tiamat, the chaos-ocean, in Babylonian myth, identified with Satan via an interpretation of the serpent in Eden.&lt;ref name="Wyatt 2001 106–107"&gt;{{harvnb|Wyatt|2001|pp=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heavens ===
[[File:Tablet_of_Shamash_relief.jpg|200px|thumb|The [[Tablet of Shamash]] depicting a solid sky with stars embedded holding up the heavenly ocean.]]

==== Form and structure ====
In the Old Testament the word ''[[shamayim]]'' represented both the sky/atmosphere, and the dwelling place of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pennington|2007|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''raqia'' or [[firmament]] - the visible sky - was a solid inverted bowl over the earth, coloured blue from the heavenly ocean above it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pennington|2007|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rain, snow, wind and hail were kept in storehouses outside the raqia, which had "windows" to allow them in - the waters for [[Noah's flood]] entered when the "windows of heaven" were opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2002|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heaven extended down to and was coterminous with (i.e. it touched) the farthest edges of the earth (e.g. Deuteronomy 4:32);&lt;ref name="Wright 2002 54"&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2002|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; humans looking up from earth saw the floor of heaven, which they saw also as God's throne, as made of clear blue [[lapis-lazuli]] (Exodus 24:9-10),and (Ezekiel 1:26).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2002|p=56}}=&lt;/ref&gt; Below that was a layer of water, the source of our rain, which was separated from us by an impenetrable barrier, the firmament (Genesis 1:6-8). The rain may also be stored in heavenly cisterns (Job: 38:37) or storehouses (Deut 28:12) alongside the storehouses for wind, hail and snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2002|p=57}}=&lt;/ref&gt;

Grammatically the word ''shamayim'' can be either dual (two) or plural (more than two), without ruling out the singular (one).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pennington|2007|pp=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it is not clear whether there were one, two, or more heavens in the Old Testament,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|2000|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most likely there was only one, and phrases such as "heaven of heavens" were meant to stress the vastness of God's realm.&lt;ref name="Wright 2002 54"/&gt;

The Babylonians had a more complex idea of heaven, and during the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE) the influence of Babylonian cosmology led to the idea of a plurality of heavens among Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|2000|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This continued into the New Testament: [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] apparently has only one heaven, but the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] and the epistles to the Colossians and the Ephesians have more than one, although they don't specify how many,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|2000|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[apostle Paul]] tells of his visit to the third heaven, the place, according to contemporary thought, where the garden of [[Paradise]] is to be found.&lt;ref name="Lee 2010 147"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2010|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====God and the heavenly beings====
[[File:Michael4.jpg|200px|thumb|The [[Archangel Michael]], a member of the host of divine beings who attend God in heaven, defeating [[Satan]], the dragon of chaos.&lt;ref name="Wyatt 2001 106–107"/&gt;]]
Israel and Judah, like other [[Canaan]]ite kingdoms, originally had a full pantheon of gods.&lt;ref name="Wright 2002 63"&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2002|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief of the old Canaanite pantheon was the god [[El (deity)|El]], but over time Yahweh replaced him as the national god and the two merged ("Yahweh-El, creator of heaven and earth" - Genesis 14:22).&lt;ref name="Wright 2002 63"/&gt; The remaining gods were now subject to Yahweh: "Who in the sky is comparable to Yahweh, like Yahweh among the divine beings? A god dreaded in the Council of holy beings...?" (Psalm 89:6-9).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2002|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Book of Job]] the Council of Heaven, the [[Sons of God]] ''(bene elohim)'' meet in heaven to review events on earth and decide the fate of Job.&lt;ref name="Habel 2001 67"&gt;{{harvnb|Habel|2001|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of their number is "the [[Satan]]", literally "the accuser", who travels over the earth much like a Persian imperial spy, (Job dates from the period of the Persian empire), reporting on, and testing, the loyalty of men to God.&lt;ref name="Habel 2001 67"/&gt;

The heavenly bodies (the [[heavenly host]] - sun, moon, and stars) were worshiped as deities, a practice which the bible disapproves and of which righteous Job protests his innocence: "If I have looked at the sun when it shone, or the moon ... and my mouth has kissed my hand, this also would be an iniquity..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deist|2000|pp=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belief in the divinity of the heavenly bodies explains a passage in Joshua 10:12, usually translated as Joshua asking the sun and moon to stand still, but in fact Joshua utters an incantation to ensure that the sun-god and moon-god, who supported his enemies, would not provide them with oracles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deist|2000|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earlier Old Testament texts the ''bene elohim'' were gods, but subsequently they became angels,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knight|Levine|2011|p=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "messengers" (''malakim''), whom Jacob sees going up and down a "ladder" (actually a celestial mountain) between heaven and earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2002|pp=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In earlier works the messengers were anonymous, but in the [[Second Temple]] period (539 BCE-100 CE) they began to be given names, and eventually became the vast [[angel]]ic orders of Christianity and Judaism.&lt;ref name="Wright 2002 63"/&gt; Thus the gods and goddesses who had once been the superiors or equals of Yahweh were first made his peers, then subordinate gods, and finally ended as angels in his service.&lt;ref name="Wright 2002 63"/&gt;

==== Paradise and the human soul ====
There is no concept of a human soul, or of eternal life, in the oldest parts of the Old Testament.&lt;ref name="Lee 2010 77–78"/&gt; Death is the going-out of the breath which God once breathed into the dust (Genesis 2:7), all men face the same fate in Sheol, a shadowy existence without knowledge or feeling (Job 14:13; Qoheloth 9:5), and there is no way that mortals can enter heaven.&lt;ref name="Lee 2010 77–78"/&gt; In the centuries after the [[Babylonian exile]], a belief in afterlife and post-death retribution appeared in Jewish [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] literature.&lt;ref name="Lee 2010 77–78"/&gt; At much the same time the Bible was translated into Greek, and the translators used the Greek word ''paradaisos'' ([[Paradise]]) for the garden of God&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bremmer|1999|p=1,19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Paradise came to be located in heaven.&lt;ref name="Lee 2010 147"/&gt;

===Earth===
[[File:Baylonianmaps.JPG|right|200px|thumb|[[Babylonian Map of the World]] (c.600 BCE). The Old Testament concept of the earth was very similar: a flat circular earth ringed by a world-ocean, with fabulous islands or mountains beyond at the "ends of the earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keel|1997|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

====Cosmic geography====
In the [[Old Testament]] period, the earth was most commonly thought of as a flat disc floating on water.&lt;ref name="Berlin 2011 189"/&gt; The concept was apparently quite similar to that depicted in a Babylonian world-map from about 600 BCE: a single circular continent bounded by a circular sea,{{sfn|Keel|1997|pp=20–22}} and beyond the sea a number of equally spaced triangles called ''nagu'', "distant regions", apparently islands although possibly mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Horowitz|1998|p=30ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Old Testament likewise locates islands alongside the earth; ({{bibleref2|Psalm|97:1|niv}}) these are the "ends of the earth" according to {{bibleref2|Isaiah|41:5|niv}}, the extreme edge of Job's circular horizon (Job 26:10) where the vault of heaven is supported on mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keel|1997|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other OT passages suggest that the sky rests on pillars (Psalm 75:3, 1 Samuel 2:8, Job 9:6), on foundations (Psalms 18:7 and 82:5), or on "supports" (Psalm 104:5),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keel|1997|pp=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Book of Job]] imagines the cosmos as a vast tent, with the earth as its floor and the sky as the tent itself; from the edges of the sky God hangs the earth over "nothing", meaning the vast Ocean, securely supported by being tied to the sky (Job 26:7).{{sfn|Hartley|1988|p=366}} If the technical means by which Yahweh keeps the earth from sinking into the chaos-waters are unclear, it is nevertheless clear that he does so by virtue of his personal power.{{sfn|Keel|1997|pp=40}}

The idea that the earth was a sphere was developed by the Greeks in the 6th century BCE, and by the 3rd century BCE this was generally accepted by educated Romans and Greeks and even by some Jews.{{sfn|Dahl|Gauvin|2000|p=17}} The author of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], however, assumed a flat earth in 7:1.{{sfn|Farmer|2005|p=33}}

====Temples, mountains, gardens and rivers====
In the cosmology of the ancient Near East, the cosmic warrior-god, after defeating the powers of chaos, would create the world and build his earthly house, the temple.&lt;ref name="Hoppe 2000 24"&gt;{{harvnb|Hoppe|2000|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as the [[abyss (religion)|abyss]], the deepest deep, was the place for Chaos and Death, so God's temple belonged on the high mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keel|1997|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Judah the mountain and the location of the Temple was [[Zion]] (Jerusalem),&lt;ref name="Hoppe 2000 24"/&gt; the navel and center of the world (Ezekiel 5:5 and 38:12).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mills|1998|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Psalms describe [[Throne of God|God sitting enthroned]] over the Flood (the cosmic sea) in his heavenly palace (Psalm 29:10), the eternal king who "lays the beams of his upper chambers in the waters" (Psalm 104:3). The [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] identifies this mountain as [[Mount Gerizim]], which the New Testament also implicitly acknowledges (John 4:20). This imagery recalls the Mesopotamian god Ea who places his throne in [[Apsu]], the primeval fresh waters beneath the earth, and the Canaanite god [[El (deity)|El]], described in the [[Baal cycle]] as having his palace on a cosmic mountain which is the source of the primordial ocean/water springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mabie|2008|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The point where heavenly and earthly realms join is depicted as an earthly "garden of God", associated with the temple and royal palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burnett|2010|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 28:12-19 places the garden in [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] on the mountain of the gods;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tigghelaar|1999|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Genesis 2-3 Eden's location is more vague, simply far away "in the east",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noort|1999|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is a strong suggestion in both that the garden is attached to a temple or palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillingham|2002|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jerusalem the earthly [[Temple of Solomon|Temple]] was decorated with motifs of the cosmos and the Garden,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2003|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, like other ancient near eastern temples, its three sections made up a symbolic microcosm, from the outer court (the visible world of land and sea), through the Holy Place (the visible heaven and the garden of God) to the [[Holy of Holies]] (the invisible heaven of God).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beale|2004|pp=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The imagery of the cosmic mountain and garden of Ezekiel reappears in the New Testament [[Book of Revelation]], applied to the [[New Jerusalem|messianic Jerusalem]], its walls adorned with precious stones, the "river of the water of life" flowing from under its throne (Revelation 22:1-2).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Delumeau|O'Connell|2000|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A stream  from underground (a subterranean ocean of fresh water?) fertilises Eden before dividing into four rivers that go out to the entire earth (Genesis 2:5-6); in Ezekiel 47:1-12 (see [[Ezekiel's Temple]]) and other prophets the stream issues from the Temple itself, makes the desert bloom, and turns the [[Dead Sea]] from salt to fresh.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bautch|2003|pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the underground waters are ambiguous: they are the source of life-giving rivers, but they are also associated with death (Jeremiah 2:6 and Job 38:16-17 describe how the way to Sheol is through water, and its gates are located at the foot of the mountain at the bottom of the seas).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bautch|2003|pp=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Underworld ===
[[File:Ge-Hinnom.jpg|thumb|225px|Valley of Hinnom (or Gehenna), c. 1900. The former site of child-sacrifice and a dumping-ground for the bodies of executed criminals, [[Jeremiah]] prophesied that it would become a "valley of slaughter" and burial place; in later literature it thus became identified with a new idea of Hell as a place where the wicked would be punished.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berlin|2011|p=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{See also|Gehenna|Hell|Sheol|Hades in Christianity}}

====Sheol and the Old Testament====
Beneath the earth is [[Sheol]], the abode of the ''[[rephaim]]'' (shades),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|1996|pp=141–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not entirely clear whether all who died became shades, or only the "mighty dead" (compare Psalm 88:10 with Isaiah 14:9 and 26:14).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Habel|1975|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some biblical passages state that God has no presence in the underworld: "In death there is no remembrance of Thee, in Sheol who shall give Thee thanks?" (Psalm 6).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|1996|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others imply that the dead themselves are in some sense semi-divine, like the shade of the prophet [[Samuel]], who is called an ''elohim'', the same word used for God and gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|1996|pp=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still other passages state God's power over Sheol as over the rest of his creation: "Tho they (the wicked) dig into Sheol, from there shall my hand take them..." (Amos 9:2).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|1996|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intertestamental period====
{{See also|Intertestamental period}}

The Old Testament Sheol was  simply the home of all the dead, good and bad alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|1996|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Hellenistic period the [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Greek-speaking Jews of Egypt]], perhaps under the influence of Greek thought, came to believe that the good would not die but would go directly to God, while the wicked would really die and go to the realm of [[Hades]], god of the underworld, where they would perhaps suffer torment.&lt;ref name="Kelly2010p121-122"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelly|2010|pp=121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Enoch]], dating from the period between the Old and New Testaments, separates the dead into a well-lit cavern for the righteous and dark caverns for the wicked,&lt;ref name="Delumeaup24"&gt;{{harvnb|Delumeau|O'Connell|2000|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provides the former with a spring, perhaps signifying that these are the "living" (i.e. a spring) waters of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bautch|2003|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the New Testament, Jesus' parable of the [[rich man and Lazarus]] reflects the idea that the wicked began their punishment in [[Hades]] immediately on dying.&lt;ref name="Kelly2010p121-122"/&gt;

====Satan and the end of time====
{{See also|War in Heaven}}
The [[New Testament]] [[Hades]] is a temporary holding place, to be used only until the [[end time|end of time]], when its inhabitants will be thrown into the pit of [[Gehenna]] or the [[Lake of Fire]] (Revelation 20:10-14).&lt;ref name="Kelly2010p122"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelly|2010|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lake is either underground, or will go underground when the "[[The New Earth|new earth]]" emerges.&lt;ref name="Kelly2010p122"/&gt; The [[Satan]] does not inhabit or supervise the underworld – his sphere of activity is the human world – and is only to be thrown into the fire at the end of time.&lt;ref name="Kelly2010p122"/&gt; He appears throughout the Old Testament not as God's enemy but as his minister, "a sort of Attorney-General with investigative and disciplinary powers", as in the [[Book of Job]].&lt;ref name="Kelly2010p122"/&gt; It was only with the early [[Church Fathers]] that he was identified with the [[Serpent (Bible)|Serpent]] of the [[Garden of Eden]] and came to be seen as an active rebel against God, seeking to thwart the divine plan for mankind.&lt;ref name="Kelly2010p122"/&gt;

The '''Bodhi Tree''' ([[Sanskrit]]: बोधि), also known as '''Bo''' (from [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]]: ''Bo''), "[[peepal]] tree", or "arasa maram" ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]:அரசமரம்)([[Devanagari]]: पीपल क पेड़),&lt;ref name="gethin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gethin|first=Rupert|authorlink=Rupert Gethin|title=The Foundations of Buddhism|page=22|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1998|ISBN=9780192892232}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a large and ancient sacred fig tree (''[[Ficus religiosa]]''&lt;ref name="gethin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Gardner, Pindar Sidisunthorn and Lai Ee May, 2011. Heritage Trees of Penang. Penang: Areca Books. {{ISBN|978-967-57190-6-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;) located in [[Bodh Gaya]], [[Bihar]], India, under which [[Siddhartha Gautama]], the spiritual teacher who became known as [[the Buddha]], is said to have attained enlightenment or ''[[Bodhi]]''.&lt;ref name=Madan&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 176|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In religious [[iconography]], the Bodhi Tree is recognizable by its heart-shaped leaves, which are usually prominently displayed. &lt;!-- The root word "Bodh" means knowledge and enlightenment.  --&gt;

The term "Bodhi Tree" is also widely applied to existing trees, particularly the sacred fig (''[[Ficus religiosa]]'') growing at the [[Mahabodhi Temple]] in Bodh Gaya, which is often cited as a direct descendant of the original specimen planted in 288 BCE. This tree is a frequent destination for [[pilgrim]]s, being the most important of the four main [[Buddhist pilgrimage]] sites.

Other holy bodhi trees which have a great significance in the history of Buddhism are the [[Jetavana|Anandabodhi]] tree in [[Sravasti]] and the [[Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi|Bodhi tree]] in [[Anuradhapura]], [[Sri Lanka]]. Both are believed to have been propagated from the original Bodhi Tree.

==Celebrations==

===Bodhi Day===
On December 8, [[Bodhi Day]] celebrates Buddha's enlightenment underneath the Bodhi Tree. Those who follow the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] greet each other by saying, “Budu saranai!” which translates to "may the peace of the Buddha be yours.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://westproxy.lib.hawaii.edu:2051/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&amp;csi=235865&amp;sr=BYLINE(David)%2Bw%2F3%2BSelf)%2BAND%2BHLEAD(Dates+for+assembly)%2BAND%2BDATE%2BIS%2B2005-12-2|title= University of Hawaii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Mahabodhi Temple}}
The Bodhi tree at the [[Mahabodhi Temple]] is called the Sri Maha Bodhi. [[Gautama Buddha]] attained [[bodhi|enlightenment]] (''bodhi'') while meditating underneath a ''Ficus religiosa''. According to [[Buddhist texts]], the Buddha meditated without moving from his seat for seven weeks (49 days) under this tree. A shrine, called [[Animisalocana cetiya]], was later erected on the spot where he sat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=x8ObMQ1GGsUC&amp;pg=PA320&amp;lpg=PA320&amp;dq=%22Animisalocana+cetiya%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8i311YfLBl&amp;sig=Eo56tcr6GdZbzqFzP9EfME76-HU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PNGQTb2YHYiIhQej6vC7Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Animisalocana%20cetiya%22&amp;f=false Animisalocana cetiya]&lt;/ref&gt;

The spot was used as a shrine even in the lifetime of the Buddha. King [[Ashoka]] was most diligent in paying homage to the Bodhi tree, and held a festival every year in its honour in the month of [[Kartika (month)|Kattika]].&lt;ref name="Mahavamsa"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Mahavamsa, chap. 17, 17.|url= http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/chap017.html|title= CHAPTER XVII_The Arrival Of The Relics
}}&lt;/ref&gt; His queen, [[Tissarakkha|Tissarakkhā]], was jealous of the Tree, and three years after she became queen (i.e., in the nineteenth year of Asoka's reign), she caused the tree to be killed by means of mandu thorns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher= Mahavamsa, chap. 20, 4f.|url= http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/chap020.html|title=CHAPTER XX_The Nibbana Of The Thera}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tree, however, grew again, and a great monastery was attached to the Bodhimanda called the Bodhimanda Vihara. Among those present at the foundation of the [[Maha Thupa|Mahā Thūpa]] are mentioned thirty thousand monks from the Bodhimanda Vihara, led by Cittagutta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Mahavamsa, chap. 29, 41.|url= http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/chap029.html|title=CHAPTER XXIX_The Beginning Of The Great Thupa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tree was again cut down by King [[Pushyamitra Shunga]] in the 2nd century BC, and by King [[Shashanka]] in 600 AD. In the 7th century AD, Chinese traveler [[Xuanzang]] wrote of the tree in detail. 
[[File:Bodhi Tree Marking - panoramio.jpg|left|thumb|Bodhi Tree sign, 2013]]
Every time the tree was destroyed, a new tree was planted at the same place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Melton|last1= J. Gordon|first2= Baumann|last2=Martin|year=2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v2yiyLLOj88C|title= ''Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices, Second edition|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]], Santa Barbara|isbn=1598842048|pages=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862 British archaeologist [[Alexander Cunningham]] wrote of the site as the first entry in the first volume of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The celebrated Bodhi tree still exists, but is very much decayed; one large stem, with three branches to the westward, is still green, but the other branches are barkless and rotten. The green branch perhaps belongs to some younger tree, as there are numerous stems of apparently different trees clustered together. The tree must have been renewed frequently, as the present Pipal is standing on a terrace at least 30 feet above the level of the surrounding country. It was in full vigour in 1811, when seen by [[Francis Buchanan-Hamilton|Dr. Buchanan (Hamilton)]], who describes it as in all probability not exceeding 100 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cu31924008747788 Archaeological Survey of India], Volume 1, Four Reports Made During the Years 1862-63-64-66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the tree decayed further and in 1876 the remaining tree was destroyed in a storm. In 1881, Cunningham planted a new Bodhi tree on the same site.&lt;ref name="buddhanet.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/dharmadata/fdd23.htm |title=Buddhist Studies: Bodhi Tree |publisher=Buddhanet.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924008747788#page/n45/mode/1up Mahâbodhi, or the great Buddhist temple under the Bodhi tree at Buddha-Gaya], Alexander Cunningham, 1892: "I next saw the tree in 1871 and again in 1875, when it had become completely decayed, and shortly afterwards in 1876 the only remaining portion of the tree fell over the west wall during a storm, and the old pipal tree was gone. Many seeds, however, had been collected and the young scion of the parent tree were already in existence to take its place."&lt;/ref&gt;

===To Jetavana, Sravasti===
[[File:Adoration_of_the_Diamond_Throne_and_the_Bodhi_Tree_Bharhut_relief.jpg|thumb|Ashoka's [[Mahabodhi Temple]] and [[Diamond throne]] in [[Bodh Gaya]], built circa 250 BCE. The inscription between the Chaitya arches reads: ''"Bhagavato Sakamunino/ bodho"'' i.e. "The building round the [[Bodhi tree]] of the Holy Sakamuni ([[Shakyamuni]])".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Luders |first1=Heinrich |title=Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum Vol.2 Pt.2 Bharhut Inscriptions |date=1963 |page=95 |url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.107897/2015.107897.Corpus-Inscriptionum-Indicarum-Vol2-Pt2-Bharhut-Inscriptions#page/n145}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bharhut]] frieze (circa 100 BCE).]]
Buddhism recounts that while the Buddha was still alive, in order that people might make their offerings in the name of the Buddha when he was away on pilgrimage, he sanctioned the planting of a seed from the Bodhi tree in Bodhgaya in front of the gateway of [[Jetavana|Jetavana Monastery]] near [[Sravasti]]. For this purpose [[Moggallana]] took a fruit from the tree as it dropped from its stalk, before it reached the ground. It was planted in a golden jar by [[Anathapindika]] with great pomp and ceremony. A sapling immediately sprouted forth, fifty [[cubit]]s high, and in order to consecrate it the Buddha spent one night under it, rapt in meditation. This tree, because it was planted under the direction of [[Ananda]], came to be known as the Ananda Bodhi.

===To Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka===

King Asoka's daughter, Sanghamittra, brought a piece of the tree with her to Sri Lanka where it is continuously growing to this day in the island's ancient capital, [[Anuradhapura]].&lt;ref name="buddhanet.net"/&gt;
This Bodhi tree was originally named [[Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi]], and was a piece of another Bodhi tree planted in the year 245 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=K.H.J. Wijayadasa |url=http://srimahabodhi.org/index.htm |title=Śrī Maha Bodhi |publisher=Srimahabodhi.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original Bodhi tree deteriorated and died of old age, the descendants of the branch that was brought by Emperor Ashoka's son, Mahindra, and his daughter, Sanghmittra, can still be found on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=George Boeree |url=http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/buddhahist.html |title=History of Buddhism |publisher=Webspace.ship.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Mahavamsa, the Sri Maha Bodhi in [[Sri Lanka]] was planted in 288 BC, making it the oldest verified specimen of any [[angiosperm]]. In this year (the twelfth year of King [[Asoka]]'s reign) the right branch of the Bodhi tree was brought by Sanghamittā to Anurādhapura and placed by [[Devanampiyatissa|Devānāmpiyatissa]] his left foot in the Mahāmeghavana. The Buddha, on his death bed, had resolved five things, one being that the branch which should be taken to Ceylon should detach itself.&lt;ref name="Mahavamsa"/&gt; From Gayā, the branch was taken to [[Pātaliputta]], thence to [[Tamralipta|Tāmalittī]], where it was placed in a ship and taken to Jambukola, across the sea; finally it arrived at [[Anuradhapura]], staying on the way at [[Tivakka]]. Those who assisted the king at the ceremony of the planting of the Tree were the nobles of Kājaragāma and of Candanagāma and of Tivakka.

The [[Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi]] is also known to be the most sacred Bodhi tree. This came upon the Buddhists who performed rites and rituals near the Bodhi tree. The Bodhi tree was known to cause rain and heal the ill. When an individual became ill, one of his or her relatives would visit the Bodhi tree to water it seven times for seven days and to vow on behalf of the sick for a speedy recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://srimahabodhi.org/rain-maker2.htm |title=Rain-makers: The Sacred Bodhi Tree Part 2 |publisher=Srimahabodhi.org |date=2003-04-24 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===To Honolulu, Hawaii===
In 1913, [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] took a sapling of the Sri Maha Bodhi to [[Hawaii]], where he presented it to his benefactor, Mary Foster, who had funded much Buddhist missionary work. She planted it in the grounds of her house in [[Honolulu]], by the Nuʻuanu stream. On her death she left her house and its grounds to the people of Honolulu, and it became the [[Foster Botanical Garden]].

===To Chennai, India===
[[File:Bodhi tree in Theosophical Society.jpg|thumb|Sapling of the Maha bodhi tree planted in the year 1950 at Theosophical society]]
In 1950, [[Jinarajadasa]] took three saplings of the Sri Maha Bodhi to plant two samplings in [[Chennai]], one was planted near the Buddha temple at the [[Theosophical Society]] another at the riverside of Adyar Estuary. The third was planted near a meditation center in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Madhavan|first1=Chitra|title=Buddhist shrine in Adyar|url=http://madrasmusings.com/Vol%2023%20No%206/buddhist-shrine-in-adyar.html|website=Madras Musings|publisher=Madras Musings|accessdate=14 November 2015|ref=(ARCHIVE) VOL. XXIII NO. 6, JULY 1-15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===To Thousand Oaks, California, USA===
In 2012, [[Brahmanda Pratap Barua, Ripon]], Dhaka, Bangladesh, took a sapling of Bodhi tree from Buddha Gaya, Maha Bodhi to [[Thousand Oaks, California]], where he presented it to his benefactor, Anagarika Glenn Hughes, who had funded much Buddhist work and teaches Buddhism in USA. He and his students received the sapling with a great thanks, later they planted the sapling in the ground in a nearby park.

===The trees of previous Buddhas===

According to the Mahavamsa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=For example, chap 15.|url=http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/chap015.html|title=CHAPTER XV_The Acceptance Of The Mahavihara}}&lt;/ref&gt; branches from the Bodhi trees of all the Buddhas born during this [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]] were planted in Ceylon ([[Sri Lanka]]) on the spot where the sacred Bodhi tree stands today in Anurādhapura. The branch of Kakusandha's tree was brought by Rucānandā, Konagamana's by Kantakānandā (or Kanakadattā), and Kassapa's by Sudhammā.

==Uses==
Prayer beads are made from the seeds of ''Ficus religiosa'', considered sacred because of the closeness to Buddha himself and his enlightenment.

'''Coming of Age''' ('''CoA''', '''COA''') is a [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] program in which a congregation fosters the transition of its [[children]] into [[youth]]. Although COA programs vary by congregation, they typically mark the individual's transition from younger [[religious education]] programs into a [[youth ministry|youth group]], [[Districts of the Unitarian Universalist Association|District-level]]/Regional [[Youth_ministry#Unitarian_Universalism|Young Religious Unitarian Universalists]] (YRUU), as well as National and Continental-level YRUU. Not all youth will enter into all of the levels of programming above, though entering into at least congregational-level YRUU (Youth group) is very common. At least one of the UUA districts holds a series of COA retreats to supplement congregational COA programs.

In most programs, a congregation's youth (usually aged 12 and above) are paired with adult mentors who are members of the congregation. Many programs ask youth to investigate their personal spirituality with the support of their mentors. Youth participants in the program are encouraged to develop a greater sense of what they believe. They do this through discussion, listening to guest speakers, and participating in retreats and workshops. Workshops may be designed to prompt the youth, challenge their modes of thinking, or aid them in furthering their ideas.  Some congregations have also encouraged or required each child and mentor to do a social action or social service project together, or organized a service project which all participating youth and mentors do together, such as cooking and serving food at a soup kitchen.

At the end of many COA programs, youth and their mentors prepare a service in which they present "faith statements" or "credo statements" &amp;mdash; written statements of belief and perspectives developed over the course of program. These statements vary in many ways, because there are few "guidelines" as to what youth may say. Typically, participants who do not wish to present a credo statement may communicate their findings in other ways; for example a choreographed dance or a musical piece they have written. Services vary from church to church and can involve almost anything that the participants want it to. Favorite hymns, dances, songs, and readings may be included.

For the most part, children identify with the faith beliefs of their parents and family.  The Coming of Age program signals the beginning of individual spiritual searching; it is an official recognition that the youth involved have begun to search for personal truth.

A '''Delphinion''' (ancient Greek: Δελφίνιον) found in ancient Greece, was a temple of [[Apollo Delphinios]] ("Apollo of the womb") also known as "Delphic Apollo" or "Pythian Apollo", the principal god of [[Delphi]], who was regarded as the protector of ports and ships.

== The Delphinion at Miletus ==
The ruin of the Delphinion in [[Miletus]] is still mostly standing. A rectangular [[temenos]], the remains of the temple at the site date back to as early as the fifth century B.C.E.  Still present are a rectangular altar with volute [[Acroterion|acroteria]], as well as a few other round marble altars. An "annual Spring procession which went from Miletus to the Temple of Apollo at Didyma began at the Delphinion" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Miletus,%20Delphinion&amp;object=Building|title=Miletus, Delphinion (Building)|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions found on the walls of the Delphinion tell us the site also served as the city archive.

== The Delphinion at Athens ==
The Delphinion in [[Athens]] near the [[Acropolis]] contained a court of law, which was used to try [[homicide]] cases where the accused had claimed the defence of [[justifiable homicide]].

[[Brigham Young]] (June 1, 1801 – August 29, 1877) was an American leader in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] and a [[settler]] of the Western United States. He was the [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) from 1847 until his death in 1877. He founded [[Salt Lake City]] and he served as the first [[Governor of Utah|governor]] of the [[Utah Territory]]. Young also led the foundings of the precursors to the [[University of Utah]] and [[Brigham Young University]].

Young was a [[plural marriage|polygamist]], marrying a total of 55 wives, 54 of them after he converted to Mormonism.&lt;ref name = "joj"&gt;{{citation |first= Jeffrey Odgen |last= Johnson |url= http://content.lib.utah.edu/u?/dialogue,17879 |title= Determining and Defining ‘Wife’&amp;nbsp;— The Brigham Young Households |journal= [[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]] |volume= 20 |issue= 3 |date=Fall 1987 |pages= 57–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was difficult for many in the church. Young stated that upon being taught about plural marriage, "It was the first time in my life that I desired the grave."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=https://www.pbs.org/mormons/peopleevents/e_polygamy.html |contribution=Polygamy and the Church: A History |department=People &amp; Events |title=[[The Mormons (miniseries)|The Mormons]] |date= April 30, 2007 |publisher= [[PBS]] |accessdate= 2013-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his death, Young had 56 children by 16 of his wives; 46 of his children reached adulthood.&lt;ref name=byubio&gt;{{citation |url= http://yfacts.byu.edu/Article?id=214 |title=Brigham Young Biography: Facts of Faith |work= Y Facts (yfacts.byu.edu) |publisher= BYU |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130920194808/http://yfacts.byu.edu/Article?id=214 |archivedate= 2013-09-20 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, 25 years after Young's death, the ''[[New York Times]]'' established that Young's direct descendants numbered more than 1000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/06/22/101218688.pdf "Descendants of Brigham Young to Hold Annual Mass Meetings"], ''[[New York Times]]'', 1902-06-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1032">In [[Ancient Roman]] religious practice, '''Dialia''' were sacred [[rite]]s to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], performed by the [[Flamen Dialis]]. It was not, however, of such necessity that the Dialia were to be performed by the Flamen Dialis; others might also have officiated. We find in the ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' of [[Tacitus]], that if he were sick, or detained by any other public employ, the pontifices took his place.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' of [[Tacitus]], III.58:

'''''God Is Not Great''''' is a 2007 book by Anglo-American author and journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]], in which he [[Criticism of religion|makes a case against organized religion]]. It was originally published in the United Kingdom by [[Atlantic Books]] as '''''God Is Not Great: The Case Against Religion''''' and in the United States by [[Twelve (publisher)|Twelve]] as '''''God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything''''', but was republished by Atlantic Books in 2017 with no subtitle.

Hitchens posited that organized religion is "violent, irrational, intolerant, allied to [[racism]], [[tribalism]], and [[bigotry]], invested in [[ignorance]] and hostile to [[freethought|free inquiry]], contemptuous of women and [[coercion|coercive]] toward children" and [[Sectarianism|sectarian]], and that accordingly it "ought to have a great deal on its conscience". He supports his position with a mixture of personal stories, documented historical anecdotes and critical analysis of religious texts. His commentary focuses mainly on the [[Abrahamic religions]], although it also touches on other religions, such as [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. The book received mixed reviews, but sold well.

[[File:Christopher Hitchens 2008-04-24 001.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Christopher Hitchens in 2008]]
===Chapter One: Putting It Mildly===
Hitchens writes that, at the age of nine, he began to question the teachings of his [[Bible]] instructor, and began to see critical flaws in [[Apologetics|apologetic]] arguments, most notably the [[Teleological argument|argument from design]].&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; He discusses people who become [[Atheism|atheists]], describing some as people who have never believed, and others as those who have separately discarded religious traditions. He asserts that atheists who disagree with each other will eventually side together on whatever the evidence most strongly supports.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; He discusses why human beings have a tendency towards being "faithful" and argues that religion will remain entrenched in the human consciousness as long as human beings cannot overcome their primitive fears, particularly that of their own [[Death|mortality]]. He concludes by saying that he would not want to eradicate religion if the faithful would "leave him alone", but ultimately they are incapable of this.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter Two: Religion Kills===
Hitchens addresses a hypothetical question that he was asked while on a panel with radio host [[Dennis Prager]]: if he were alone in an unfamiliar city at night, and a group of strangers began to approach him, would he feel safer, or less safe, knowing that these men had just come from a prayer meeting?  Hitchens answers, {{quote|Just to stay within the letter 'B', I have actually had that experience in [[Belfast]], [[Beirut]], [[Bombay]], [[Belgrade]], [[Bethlehem]] and [[Baghdad]]. In each case ... I would feel immediately threatened if I thought that the group of men approaching me in the dusk were coming from a religious observance.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He gives detailed descriptions of the tense social and political situations within these cities, which he personally experienced and attributes to religion.  He has thus "not found it a prudent rule to seek help as the prayer meeting breaks up".&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

He discusses the 1989 [[fatwa]] issued on author and friend [[Salman Rushdie]] by the [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] because of the contents of Rushdie's book ''[[The Satanic Verses]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; He criticises several public figures for laying the blame for the incident on Rushdie himself.  He also writes about the events following the [[September 11 attacks]], describing how religion, particularly major religious figures, allowed matters to "deteriorate in the interval between the removal of the Taliban and the overthrow of [[Saddam Hussein]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter Three: A Short Digression On The Pig; or, Why Heaven Hates Ham===
Hitchens discusses the [[Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork|prohibition on eating pigs]] ("porcophobia" as Hitchens calls it) in [[Judaism]], also adopted by [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, pp. 37-41.&lt;/ref&gt; He says that this proscription is not just [[Bible|Biblical]] or [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]]. He reports that even today, Muslim zealots demand that the [[Three Little Pigs]], [[Miss Piggy]], [[Piglet (Winnie the Pooh)|Piglet]] from [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] and other traditional pets and characters be "removed from the innocent gaze of their children".&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens suggests that the pork prohibition found in Semitic religions may be based in the proscription of human sacrifice, extended to pigs because of the similarities in appearance and flavor between pork and human flesh.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens, p. 40: ""Porcophobia - and porcophilia - thus probably originate in a nighttime of human sacrifice and even cannibalism at which the 'holy texts' do more than hint."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter Four: A Note On Health, To Which Religion May Be Hazardous===
Hitchens explains how some religions can be hostile to disease treatment. He writes that many [[Muslim]]s saw the [[polio vaccine]] as a [[conspiracy (civil)|conspiracy]], and thus allowed [[polio]] to spread.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, pp. 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt;  He discusses the [[Catholic Church]]'s response to the spread of [[HIV]] in [[Africa]], telling people that [[condom]]s are ineffective, which, he argues, contributed to the death toll.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, pp. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes with examples that some in both the Catholic and the Muslim communities believe irrationally that [[HIV]] and [[HPV]] are punishment for sexual sin—particularly [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes religious leaders as "faith healers", and opines that they are hostile to [[medicine]] because it undermines their position of power.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

He criticises the [[Jewish]] ritual of [[circumcision]] that would have him "take a baby boy's [[penis]] in my hand, cut around the [[Foreskin|prepuce]], and complete the action by taking his penis in my mouth, sucking off the [[foreskin]], and spitting out the amputated flap along with a mouthful of [[blood]] and [[saliva]]", and denounces the traditional African practice of [[female genital mutilation]]. He concludes the chapter writing of the religious "wish for obliteration"—for a death in the form of the day of the [[Apocalypse]].

===Chapter Five: The Metaphysical Claims of Religion Are False===
Hitchens begins by saying that the strong faith that could stand up to any form of reason is long gone. He compares the popular knowledge of the world in [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s time to what we now know about the world. He uses the example of [[Laplace]]—"It works well enough without that [God] hypothesis"&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, pp. 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt;—to demonstrate that we do not need God to explain things; he claims that religion becomes obsolete as an explanation when it becomes optional or one among many different beliefs. He concludes that the leap of faith is not just one leap; it is a leap repeatedly made, and a leap that becomes more difficult to take the more it is taken: which is why so many religionists now feel the need to move beyond mere faith and cite evidence for their beliefs.

===Chapter Six: Arguments From Design===
Hitchens says that [[Abrahamic religions]] are used to making people feel like lowly sinners, encouraging low self-esteem, while at the same time leading them to believe that their creator genuinely cares for them, thus inflating their sense of self-importance. He says that [[superstition]] to some extent has a "natural advantage", being that it was contrived many centuries before the modern age of human reason and scientific understanding, and discusses a few examples as well as so-called miracles.

He discusses the design arguments, using examples such as the human body wearing out in old age as bad design. He writes that if [[evolution]] had taken a slightly different course, there would be no guarantee at all that organisms remotely like us would ever have existed.

===Chapter Seven: The Nightmare Of The Old Testament===
Hitchens lists [[anachronism]]s and [[Internal consistency of the Bible#Old Testament|inconsistencies in the Old Testament]], stating that many of the "gruesome, disordered events ... never took place".&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;  He says the [[Pentateuch]] is "an ill-carpentered fiction, bolted into place well after the non-events that it fails to describe convincingly or even plausibly".&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; He points out that when [[Moses]] orders parents to have their children stoned to death (see also [[List of capital crimes in the Torah]]) for indiscipline (citing [[Deuteronomy]]&lt;ref&gt;Probably a reference to {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|21:18-21}}: "If a man have a stubborn and unruly son [...] the people of the city shall stone him."&lt;/ref&gt;) it is probably a violation of at least one of the very [[Ten Commandments|commandments]] which Moses received from God. He notes that Moses "continually makes demented pronouncements ('He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord')."&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter Eight: The "New" Testament Exceeds The Evil Of The "Old" One===
On the subject of a [[Christ myth theory|mythical Jesus]] and the possibility of a [[historical Jesus]] in the Gospels, a number of sources on the Internet attribute the controversial quote "Jesus is Santa Claus for adults"' to Hitchens and ''God Is Not Great,'' but those words do not appear in this chapter or this book. Hitchens does argue that the "multiple authors—none of whom published anything until many decades after the Crucifixion—cannot agree on anything of importance",&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; "the gospels are most certainly not literal truth",&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; and there is "little or no evidence for the life of Jesus".&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;  To Hitchens, the best argument for the "highly questionable existence of Jesus", however, is biblical inconsistency, explaining the "very attempts to bend and stretch the story may be inverse proof that someone of later significance ''was'' indeed born".&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchens first connects the [[Book of Isaiah]] in the Old Testament with its prediction that "a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son" (see [[Isaiah 7:14]]), pointing out where the stories converge, Old Testament to [[New Testament|New]]. Comparing the Testaments, he considers the New Testament "also a work of crude carpentry, hammered together long after its purported events, and full of improvised attempts to make things come out right". He points out that, while [[H. L. Mencken]] considered some of the New Testament events to be historically verifiable, Mencken maintained that "most of them ... show unmistakable signs of having been tampered with".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Hitchens 2007, pp. 109-110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchens also outlines the inaccuracy in [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]]'s attempt to [[Triangulation (social science)|triangulate]] three world events of the time with [[Jesus]]'s birth: the census ordered by [[Augustus]] of the entire [[ancient Rome|Roman world]], the reign of [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] in [[Judea]] and that of [[Quirinius]] as governor of Syria (see the [[Census of Quirinius]]). He says that there is no record by any Roman historian of any [[Augustus|Augustan]] census, and that, although "the Jewish chronicler [[Josephus]] mentions one that did occur—without the onerous requirement for people to return to their places of birth", it was undertaken "six years after the birth of Jesus is supposed to have taken place". He also notes that Herod died in 4 BC, and that [[Quirinius]] was not governor of Syria during his tenure.

Hitchens refers to ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' as "a [[soap-opera]] film about the death of Jesus ... produced by an Australian [[fascist]] and ham actor named [[Mel Gibson]]", who "adheres to a crackpot and schismatic [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] sect". In Hitchens's view, the film attempts tirelessly to [[Jewish deicide|blame the death of Jesus on the Jews]]. He claims that Gibson did not realize that the four [[Gospel]]s were not at all historical records, and that they had multiple authors, all being written many decades after the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]—and, moreover, that they do not agree on anything "of importance" (e.g., the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] and the [[genealogy of Jesus]]). He cites many [[Internal consistency of the Bible|contradictions]] in this area.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, pp. 110-112.&lt;/ref&gt;

He further contends that the [[Internal consistency of the Bible#New Testament|many "contradictions and illiteracies" of the New Testament]], while extensively covered by other authors, have never been explained except as "[[metaphor]]" and "a Christ of faith". He states that the "feebleness" of the Bible is a result of the fact that until recently, [[Christian]]s faced with arguments against the logic or factualness of the Bible "could simply burn or silence anybody who asked any inconvenient questions".&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 115)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchens points out the problematic implications of the scriptural proclamation "he that is without sin among you, let him cast a first stone" with regard to the practical legislation of retributive justice: "if only the non-sinners have the right to punish, then how could an imperfect society ever determine how to prosecute offenders?" Of the [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|adulterous woman whom Jesus saved from stoning]], the author contends that Jesus thus forgives her of sheer [[fornication|sexual promiscuity]], and, if this be the case, that the lesson has ever since been completely misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Closing the chapter,&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; he suggests that advocates of religion have faith alone to rely on—nothing else—and calls on them to "be brave enough" to admit it.

===Chapter Nine: The Koran Is Borrowed From Both Jewish and Christian Myths===
Chapter nine assesses the religion of [[Islam]], and examines the origin of its holy book, the [[Quran]]. Hitchens asserts that there is no evidence for any of the "miraculous" claims about [[Muhammad]], and that the Koran's origin was not supernatural. He contends that the religion was fabricated by Muhammad or his followers and that it was borrowed from other religious texts, and the [[hadith]] was taken from common maxims and sayings which developed throughout Arabia and Persia at the time. He identifies similarities between Islam and Christianity, and notes several plagiarisms of the Jewish faith.

===Chapter Ten: The Tawdriness Of The Miraculous And The Decline Of Hell===
Chapter ten discusses [[miracle]]s. Hitchens says that no supernatural miracles occur, nor have occurred in history. He says that evidence of miracles is fabricated, or based on the unreliable testimony of people who are mistaken or biased. He notes that no verifiable miracle has been documented since cameras have become commonplace. Hitchens uses a specific purported miracle by [[Mother Teresa]] to show how miracles can become perceived as true, when in fact they are based on myth or falsehood.

===Chapter Eleven: Religion's Corrupt Beginnings===
Chapter eleven discusses how religions form, and claims that most religions are founded by corrupt, immoral individuals. The chapter specifically discusses [[cargo cult]]s, Pentecostal minister [[Marjoe Gortner]], and [[Mormonism]]. Hitchens discusses [[Joseph Smith]], the founder of Mormonism, citing a March 1826 Bainbridge, New York court examination accusing him of being a "disorderly person and impostor" who Hitchens claims admitted there that he had supernatural powers and was "defrauding citizens".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/features/2007/god_is_not_great/mormonism_a_racket_becomes_a_religion.html|title=3. Mormonism: A Racket Becomes a Religion in Fighting Words: God Is Not Great|first=Christopher|last=Hitchens|date=April 27, 2007|journal=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith/Legal_issues/Trials/1826_glasslooking_trial|quote=Joseph Smith was brought to trial in 1826 for 'glasslooking'. |title=Joseph Smith: Legal issues|work=FairMormon Answers|publisher=[[FairMormon]]|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later Smith claimed to obtain gold tablets containing the [[Book of Mormon]]. When the neighbor's skeptical wife buried 116 pages of the translation and challenged Smith to reproduce it, Smith claimed God, knowing this would happen, told him to instead translate a different section of the same plates.

===Chapter Twelve: A Coda: How Religions End===
Chapter twelve discusses the termination of several religions, to illustrate that some religions are not everlasting, as they claim. The religions addressed include [[Millerism]] and [[Sabbatai Sevi]].

===Chapter Thirteen: Does Religion Make People Behave Better?===
Hitchens addresses the question of whether religious people behave more virtuously than non-religious people ([[atheists]], [[agnostics]], or [[freethinkers]]). He uses the battle against [[slavery in the United States]], and [[Abraham Lincoln]], to support his claim that non-religious people battle for moral causes with as much vigor and effect as religious advocates.

===Chapter Fourteen: There Is No "Eastern" Solution===
Hitchens dismisses the idea of seeking enlightenment through [[nirvana]] as a conceit that asks adherents to "put their reason to sleep, and to discard their minds along with their sandals"&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; in chapter fourteen, which focuses on maladaptive and immiserating Hindu and Buddhist feudalism and violence in [[Tibet]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. It touches on the lucrative careers of [[Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh)|Chandra Mohan Jain]] and [[Sathya Sai Baba|Sathyanarayana Raju]], and details his observations of a "brisk fleecing" and the unstable devotees witnessed during the author's staged pilgrimage to an [[ashram]] in [[Pune]], which was undertaken as part of a [[BBC]] documentary.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, pp. 195–204.&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests that BBC has no longer a "standard of fairness". He suggests that image of "imperial-way buddhism" is not that of the original [[Gautama Buddha]], and looks at the Japanese Buddhists who joined the Axis forces in [[World War II]].

Hitchens seeks to answer the question "How might one easily prove that 'Eastern' faith was identical with the unverifiable assumptions of 'Western' religion?"&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes:

{{Quote|It ought to be possible for me to pursue my studies and researches in one house, and for the Buddhist to spin his wheel in another. But contempt for the intellect has a strange way of '''not''' being passive. One of two things may happen: those who are innocently credulous may become easy prey for those who are less scrupulous and who seek to "lead" and "inspire" them. Or those whose credulity has led their own society into stagnation may seek a solution, not in true self-examination, but in blaming others for their backwardness. Both these things happened in the most consecratedly "spiritual" society of them all."&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 2007, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Chapter Fifteen: Religion As An Original Sin===
Chapter 15 discusses five aspects of religions that Hitchens maintains are "positively immoral":
* Presenting a false picture of the world to the credulous
* The doctrine of blood [[sacrifice]] to appease gods (such as by the [[Aztecs]])
* The doctrine of [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] ([[Crusades#Pope Urban II|harming innocent people to atone for sins]])
* The doctrine of [[Heaven|eternal reward]] or [[Hell|eternal punishment]]
* The imposition of impossible tasks or rules (including unhealthy views of [[sexuality]])

===Chapter Sixteen: Is Religion Child Abuse?===
Hitchens discusses how religion has been used to [[child abuse|cause harm to children]]. He cites examples such as [[genital modification and mutilation|genital mutilation]] or [[circumcision]], and imposition of fear of healthy sexual activities such as [[masturbation]]. He criticizes the way that adults use religion to terrorize children.

===Chapter Seventeen: An Objection Anticipated===
Chapter seventeen addresses the most common counter-argument that Hitchens says he hears, namely that the most immoral acts in human history were performed by atheists like [[Joseph Stalin]]. He says "it is interesting that people of faith now seek defensively to say they are no worse than fascists or Nazis or Stalinists". He analyzes those examples of immorality, and shows that although the individual leaders may have been atheist or agnostic, that religion played a key role in these events, and religious people and religious leaders fully participated in the wars and crimes.

===Chapter Eighteen: A Finer Tradition: The Resistance Of The Rational===
Chapter eighteen discusses several important intellectuals, including [[Socrates]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Voltaire]], [[Spinoza]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Charles Darwin]], and [[Isaac Newton]]. Hitchens claims that many of these people were atheists, agnostics, or [[Pantheism|pantheists]], except for Socrates and Newton. He says that religious advocates have attempted to misrepresent some of these icons as religious, and describes how some of these individuals fought against the negative influences of religion.

===Chapter Nineteen: In Conclusion: The Need for a New Enlightenment===
Hitchens argues that the human race no longer needs religion to the extent it has in the past. He says the time has come for science and reason to take a more prominent role in the life of individuals and larger cultures; that de-emphasizing religion will improve the quality of life of individuals, and assist the progress of civilization. It is in effect a rallying call to atheists to fight the theocratic encroachment on free society.

==Critical reception==
===Positive critique===
[[Michael Kinsley]], in ''[[The New York Times]]'' Book Review, lauded Hitchens's "logical flourishes and conundrums, many of them entertaining to the nonbeliever". He concluded that "Hitchens has outfoxed the Hitchens watchers by writing a serious and deeply felt book, totally consistent with his beliefs of a lifetime".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/books/review/Kinsley-t.html?ex=1181880000&amp;en=1cff92bb5e3db397&amp;ei=5070 Michael Kinsley, The New York Times Review of Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce DeSilva]] considered the book to be the best piece of atheist writing since [[Bertrand Russell]]'s ''[[Why I Am Not a Christian]]'' (1927), with Hitchens using "elegant yet biting prose". He concludes that "Hitchens has nothing new to say, although it must be acknowledged that he says it exceptionally well".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://religion.beloblog.com/archives/2007/04/hitchens_blames_religion_for_w_1.html |title=Dallas News, "Hitchens blames religion for -- well, you name it" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927173341/http://religion.beloblog.com/archives/2007/04/hitchens_blames_religion_for_w_1.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hachettebookgroupusa.com/authors/69/3732/critical_praise.html |title=Critical Praise, God Is Not Great (Hardcover) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827023356/http://www.hachettebookgroupusa.com/authors/69/3732/critical_praise.html |archivedate=2007-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was praised in ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' as a "pleasingly intemperate assault on organized religion" that "like-minded readers will enjoy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/christopher-hitchens/god-is-not-great/|title=God Is Not Great|magazine=Kirkus Reviews|date=March 1, 2007|accessdate=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', Matt Buchanan dubbed it "a thundering 300-page cannonade; a thrillingly fearless, impressively wide-ranging, thoroughly bilious and angry book against the idea of God"; Buchanan found the work to be "easily the most impressive of the present crop of atheistic and anti-theistic books: clever, broad, witty and brilliantly argued".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/book-reviews/god-is-not-great-how-religion-poisons-everything/2007/05/25/1179601648057.html?page=2|title=God is Not Great: how religion poisons everything|last=Buchanan|first=Matt|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=May 25, 2007|accessdate=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jason Cowley]] in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' called the book "elegant but derivative".&lt;ref&gt;September 23, 2011 10:05 pm. ''The War on Error'' By Jason Cowley&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=March 2017}}

===Negative critique===
[[David Bentley Hart]], reviewing the book in the Christian journal ''[[First Things]]'', interpreted the book as a "rollicking burlesque, without so much as a pretense of logical order or scholarly rigor".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|author=David B. Hart |url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2010/04/believe-it-or-not |title=Believe It or Not |publisher=First Things |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=5 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404003053/http://www.firstthings.com/article/2010/04/believe-it-or-not |archivedate=4 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart says "On matters of simple historical and textual fact, moreover, Hitchens' book is so extraordinarily crowded with errors that one soon gives up counting them." Hart notes that Hitchens conflates the histories of the 1st and 4th crusades, restates the long discredited assertion that the early church destroyed ancient pagan texts, and asserts that [[Myles Coverdale]] and [[John Wycliffe]] were burned alive when both men died of old age.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[Ross Douthat]], wrote in the ''[[Claremont Review of Books]]'' that "Every talented writer is entitled to be a bore on at least one subject, but where religion is concerned Christopher Hitchens abuses the privilege." He said that "Hitchens's argument proceeds principally by anecdote, and at his best he is as convincing as that particular style allows, which is to say not terribly."&lt;ref name=clare&gt;[http://www.claremont.org/crb/article/lord-have-mercy/  Lord Have Mercy: A review of God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything] by Ross Douthat&lt;/ref&gt; Even though "[i]t might be argued that the brevity of the book and the amount of ground it covers should excuse the less-than-rigorous fashion in which it advances its more controversial arguments... the demands of brevity should clarify and hone, whereas Hitchens manages to be both short and sloppy."&lt;ref name=clare/&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', Kabir Helminski noted that "Hitchens' debating style begins with a self-assured and urbane wit and ends with rude ad-hominem attacks stopping just short of insulting his opponent's mother." Helminski maintains that Hitchens's "verbal weaponry is formidable, and sometimes even entertaining" but that "in presenting the secular rationalist versus the religious fanatic, he obscures the fact that the greatest slaughters of human history, by far, were not the result of religious wars, but the result of secular or non-religious ideologies: Stalin, Hitler, Mao slaughtered more human beings than all the religious wars of history by a ten fold factor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Helminski|first1=Kabir|title=Christopher Hitchens is "Not Great"|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kabir-helminski/christopher-hitchens-is-n_1_b_1158640.html|website=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Prothero of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' considered Hitchens correct on many points but found the book "maddeningly dogmatic" and criticized Hitchens's condemnation of religion altogether, writing that "If this is religion, then by all means we should have less of it. But the only people who believe that religion is about believing blindly in a God who blesses and curses on demand and sees science and reason as spawns of Satan are unlettered fundamentalists and their atheistic doppelgangers.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/03/AR2007050301907.html|title=The Unbeliever|last=Prothero|first=Stephen|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=May 6, 2007|accessdate=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mary Riddell]] wrote in ''[[The Observer]]'' that: "Hitchens's book will be manna to the converted, but his explicit aim is to win believers to his cause. I doubt that he will reclaim a single soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jun/03/society|location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Mary|last=Riddell|title=Review: ''God Is Not Great'' by Christopher Hitchens|date=June 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to Hitchens's claim that "all attempts to reconcile faith with science and reason are consigned to failure and ridicule", Peter Berkowitz of the [[Hoover Institution]] quotes a paleontologist that Hitchens himself commended, [[Stephen Jay Gould]]. Referencing a number of scientists with religious faith, Gould wrote, "Either half my colleagues are enormously stupid, or else the science of [[Darwinism]] is fully compatible with conventional religious beliefs—and equally compatible with atheism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/reviews/gould_darwin-on-trial.html|title=Stephen Jay Gould "Impeaching a Self-Appointed Judge," 1992|publisher=Stephenjaygould.org|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William J. Hamblin]] of the ''[[Mormon Studies Review|FARMS Review]]'' felt that Hitchens's understanding of biblical studies was "flawed at best", and felt that he misrepresented the Bible "at the level of a confused undergraduate", failing to contextualise it. Hamblin criticised Hitchens for wrongly implying unanimity among biblical scholars on controversial points, and overlooking alternative scholarly positions. Hamblin concluded that the book "should certainly not be seen as reasonable grounds for rejecting belief in God".&lt;ref&gt;William J. Hamblin, "[http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/review/?vol=21&amp;num=2&amp;id=773 The Most Misunderstood Book: Christopher Hitchens on the Bible]," ''FARMS Review'' 21/2 (2009), 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel C. Peterson]] attacked the accuracy of Hitchens's claims in a lengthy essay, describing it as "crammed to the bursting point with errors, and the striking thing about this is that the errors are always, ''always'', in Hitchens's favor".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel C. Peterson, "[http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/review/?vol=19&amp;num=2&amp;id=653 Editor's Introduction: God and Mr. Hitchens]," ''FARMS Review'' 19/2 (2007), xxxvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the book in the online periodical ''[[Taki's Magazine]]'', [[Tom Piatek]] wrote, "Although Hitchens’ book is lively and well written, it is fatally marred by its many rhetorical evasions and falsehoods." Piatek concludes, "Hitchens, for all his malice, is strangely naïve: he imagines that we can gleefully tear up the taproots of our civilization and still continue to enjoy its fruits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Theodoracopulos|first=Taki|url=http://takimag.com/article/hitchens_hubris/print#axzz2AX9XYfz6|title=Hitchens’ Hubris|publisher=Takimag.com|date=24 July 2007|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Curtis White (author)|Curtis White]] criticized the book as "intellectually shameful" due to its lack of intellectual rigor. White, an atheist critic of religion, asserts that "[O]ne enormous problem with Hitchens’s book is that it reduces religion to a series of criminal anecdotes. In the process, however, virtually all of the real history of religious thought, as well as historical and textual scholarship, is simply ignored as if it never existed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Curtis|title=Christopher Hitchens’ lies do atheism no favors|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/06/23/christopher_hitchens_lies_do_atheism_no_favors/|website=salon.com|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 interview, art and literary critic [[Camille Paglia]] called ''God Is Not Great'' "a travesty", saying "[Hitchens] sold that book on the basis of the brilliant chapter titles. If he had actually done the research and the work, where each chapter had the substance of those wonderful chapter titles, then that would have been a permanent book. Instead, he sold the book and then didn't write one–he talked it. ... He appears to have done very little scholarly study. Hitchens didn't even know Judeo-Christianity well, much less the other world religions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/07/29/camille_paglia_takes_on_jon_stewart_trump_sanders_liberals_think_of_themselves_as_very_open_minded_but_that’s_simply_not_true/|title=Camille Paglia takes on Jon Stewart, Trump, Sanders: “Liberals think of themselves as very open-minded, but that’s simply not true!”|last=Daley|first=David|publisher=Salon.com|date=July 29, 2015|accessdate=July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kenneth "Harry" Oldmeadow''' is an [[Australia]]n academic, [[author]], [[editing|editor]] and [[educator]] whose works focus on [[religion]], [[tradition]], [[Traditionalist School|traditionalist writers]] and [[philosophy]].

==Life and career==

Oldmeadow was born in [[Melbourne]] in 1947. His parents were [[Christian]] [[missionaries]] in [[India]] and he spent the first nine years of his childhood there and developed an early interest in the civilisations of the East.&lt;ref name = "WWauthors"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(fr) [https://www.editions-hozhoni.com/contributeurs/harry-oldmeadow/ Éditions Hozoni]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oldmeadow studied history, politics and literature at the [[Australian National University]] and the [[University of Sydney]], as well as working as a history tutor at [[La Trobe University]] in [[Melbourne]]. In 1971 a Commonwealth Overseas Research Scholarship allowed him to study at [[Oxford University]], followed by extensive travel in Europe and North Africa.&lt;ref name = "WWauthors"/&gt;

In 1980 he achieved a [[master's degree]] in [[religious studies]] at the [[University of Sydney]] where he completed a dissertation on the work of [[Frithjof Schuon]] and the other principal [[tradition]]alist writers.&lt;ref&gt; (fr) [http://www.almora.fr/auteur/harry-oldmeadow.html Almora auteur]&lt;/ref&gt;  This study was awarded the University of Sydney Medal for excellence in research and was eventually published by the [[Sri Lanka]] Institute of Traditional Studies under the title ''Traditionalism: Religion in the Light of the Perennial Philosophy'' (Colombo, 2000).&lt;ref name = "WWauthors"&gt;[http://www.worldwisdom.com/public/authors/Harry-Oldmeadow.aspx World Wisdom]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the auspices of this institute, Oldmeadow delivered the Inaugural [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] Memorial Lecture in [[Colombo]] on ''The Religious Tradition of the Australian Aborigines''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sinha |first=Lalita |date=2008 |title= Unveiling the Garden of Love: Mystical Symbolism |url= https://books.google.fr/books?id=z3Z3Lg1sUOMC&amp;pg=PA209 |location= |publisher=World Wisdom |page=209 |isbn= 9781933316635 |author-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tes.com/teaching-resource/some-puzzles-and-conundrums-in-the-teaching-of-religion-audio-lecture-11020410 Tes, Puzzles and conandrums in the teaching of religion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioperennis.org/documents/Oldmeadow/MelodiesE.pdf Religio perennis]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oldmeadow was the Co-ordinator of Philosophy and Religious Studies at [[La Trobe University]], Bendigo. He has published extensively in such journals as ''Sacred Web'' (Vancouver), ''Sophia'' (Washington DC) and ''Asian Philosophy'' (Nottingham, UK). In late 2001, he was a key speaker at a large interfaith gathering in Sydney organised by the [[Australian Centre for Sufism]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiansuficentre.org/events.htm Australian Sufi Center]&lt;/ref&gt; the theme of the meeting was the need for interreligious understanding in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]].

'''Heinrich Luitpold Himmler''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhaɪnʁɪç ˈluːɪtˌpɔlt ˈhɪmlɐ|lang|de-Heinrich Himmler.ogg}}; 7 October 1900&amp;nbsp;– 23 May 1945) was ''[[Reichsführer-SS|Reichsführer]]'' of the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (Protection Squadron; SS), and a leading member of the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. Himmler was one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany and one of the people most directly responsible for [[the Holocaust]].

As a member of a reserve battalion during World War I, Himmler did not see active service. He studied [[agronomy]] in university, and joined the Nazi Party in 1923 and the SS in 1925. In 1929, he was appointed ''Reichsführer-SS'' by Hitler. Over the next 16 years, he developed the SS from a mere 290-man battalion into a million-strong paramilitary group, and, following Hitler's orders, set up and controlled the [[Nazi concentration camps]]. He was known for good organisational skills and for selecting highly competent subordinates, such as [[Reinhard Heydrich]] in 1931. From 1943 onwards, he was both Chief of German Police and Minister of the Interior, overseeing all internal and external police and security forces, including the [[Gestapo]] (Secret State Police). Himmler had a lifelong interest in [[occult]]ism, interpreting [[Neopaganism in German-speaking Europe|Germanic neopagan]] and ''[[Völkisch movement|Völkisch]]'' beliefs to promote the [[racial policy of Nazi Germany]], and incorporating [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] symbolism and rituals into the SS.

On Hitler's behalf, Himmler formed the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' and built [[extermination camp]]s. As facilitator and overseer of the concentration camps, Himmler directed the killing of some six million [[Jews]], between 200,000 and 500,000 [[Romani people]], and other victims; the total number of civilians killed by the regime is estimated at eleven to fourteen million people. Most of them were [[World War II crimes in Poland|Polish]] and [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|Soviet]] citizens.

Late in World War II, Hitler briefly appointed him a military commander and later Commander of the [[Replacement Army|Replacement (Home) Army]] and [[Plenipotentiary|General Plenipotentiary]] for the administration of the entire Third Reich (''Generalbevollmächtigter für die Verwaltung''). Specifically, he was given command of the [[Army Group Oberrhein (Germany)|Army Group Upper Rhine]] and the [[Army Group Vistula]]; he failed to achieve his assigned objectives and Hitler replaced him in these posts. Realising that the war was lost, Himmler attempted to open peace talks with the western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] without Hitler's knowledge, shortly before the war ended. Hearing of this, Hitler dismissed him from all his posts in April 1945 and ordered his arrest. Himmler attempted to go into hiding, but was detained and then arrested by British forces once his identity became known. While in British custody, he committed suicide on 23 May 1945.

== Early life ==
Heinrich Luitpold Himmler was born in [[Munich]] on 7 October 1900 into a conservative middle-class Roman Catholic family. His father was Joseph Gebhard Himmler (17 May 1865 – 29 October 1936), a teacher, and his mother was Anna Maria Himmler (née Heyder; 16 January 1866 – 10 September 1941), a devout Roman Catholic. Heinrich had two brothers, [[Gebhard Ludwig Himmler|Gebhard Ludwig]] (29 July 1898 – 1982) and [[Ernst Hermann Himmler|Ernst Hermann]] (23 December 1905 – 2 May 1945).{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=12–15}}

Himmler's first name, Heinrich, was that of his [[Godparent|godfather]], [[Prince Heinrich of Bavaria]], a member of the [[Line of succession to the former Bavarian throne|royal family of Bavaria]], who had been tutored by Gebhard Himmler.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=1}}{{sfn|Breitman|2004|p=9}} He attended a grammar school in [[Landshut]], where his father was deputy principal. While he did well in his schoolwork, he struggled in athletics.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=17–19}} He had poor health, suffering from lifelong stomach complaints and other ailments. In his youth he trained daily with weights and exercised to become stronger. Other boys at the school later remembered him as studious and awkward in social situations.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|pp=3, 6–7}}

Himmler's diary, which he kept intermittently from the age of 10, shows that he took a keen interest in current events, dueling, and "the serious discussion of religion and sex".{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=16}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=8}} In 1915, he began training with the Landshut Cadet Corps. His father used his connections with the royal family to get Himmler accepted as an officer candidate, and he enlisted with the reserve battalion of the 11th Bavarian Regiment in December 1917. His brother, Gebhard, served on the western front and saw combat, receiving the [[Iron Cross]] and eventually being promoted to lieutenant. In November 1918, while Himmler was still in training, the war ended with Germany's defeat, denying him the opportunity to become an officer or see combat. After his discharge on 18 December, he returned to Landshut.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=20–26}} After the war, Himmler completed his grammar-school education. From 1919–22, he studied [[agronomy]] at the Munich ''[[Technische Hochschule]]'' (now [[Technical University Munich]]) following a brief apprenticeship on a farm and a subsequent illness.{{sfn|Breitman|2004|p=12}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=29}}

Although many regulations that discriminated against non-Christians—including Jews and other minority groups—had been eliminated during the [[unification of Germany]] in 1871, [[antisemitism]] continued to exist and thrive in Germany and other parts of Europe.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=22–25}} Himmler was antisemitic by the time he went to university, but not exceptionally so; students at his school would avoid their Jewish classmates.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=33, 42}} He remained a devoted Catholic while a student, and spent most of his leisure time with members of his fencing fraternity, the "League of Apollo", the president of which was Jewish. Himmler maintained a polite demeanor with him and with other Jewish members of the fraternity, in spite of his growing antisemitism.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=31, 35, 47}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|pp=6, 8–9, 11}} During his second year at university, Himmler redoubled his attempts to pursue a military career. Although he was not successful, he was able to extend his involvement in the paramilitary scene in Munich. It was at this time that he first met [[Ernst Röhm]], an early member of the [[Nazi Party]] and co-founder of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' ("Storm Battalion"; SA).{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=54}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=10}} Himmler admired Röhm because he was a decorated combat soldier, and at his suggestion Himmler joined his antisemitic nationalist group, the ''[[Bund Reichskriegsflagge]]'' (Imperial War Flag Society).{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=40}}

In 1922, Himmler became more interested in the "[[Jewish question]]", with his diary entries containing an increasing number of antisemitic remarks and recording a number of discussions about Jews with his classmates. His reading lists, as recorded in his diary, were dominated by antisemitic pamphlets, German myths, and occult tracts.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=42}} After the murder of Foreign Minister [[Walther Rathenau]] on 24 June, Himmler's political views veered towards the radical right, and he took part in demonstrations against the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|Hyperinflation]] was raging, and his parents could no longer afford to educate all three sons. Disappointed by his failure to make a career in the military and his parents' inability to finance his doctoral studies, he was forced to take a low-paying office job after obtaining his agricultural diploma. He remained in this position until September 1923.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=60, 64–65}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|pp=9–11}}

=== Nazi activist ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:HimmlerOberfhr.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Himmler in early SS uniform, with rank of ''Oberführer'']] --&gt;
Himmler joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in August 1923, receiving Party number 14,303.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=11}}{{sfn|Biondi|2000|p=7}} As a member of Röhm's paramilitary unit, Himmler was involved in the [[Beer Hall Putsch]]—an unsuccessful attempt by Hitler and the NSDAP to seize power in Munich. This event would set Himmler on a life of politics. He was questioned by the police about his role in the putsch, but was not charged because of insufficient evidence. However, he lost his job, was unable to find employment as an agronomist, and had to move in with his parents in Munich. Frustrated by these failures, he became ever more irritable, aggressive, and opinionated, alienating both friends and family members.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=72–75}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|pp=11–12}}

In 1923–24, Himmler, while searching for a world view, came to abandon Catholicism and focused on the occult and in antisemitism. Germanic mythology, reinforced by occult ideas, became a religion for him. Himmler found the NSDAP appealing because its political positions agreed with his own views. Initially, he was not swept up by Hitler's charisma or the cult of Führer worship. However, as he learned more about Hitler through his reading, he began to regard him as a useful face of the party,{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=77–81, 87}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|pp=11–13}} and he later admired and even worshipped him.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=227}} To consolidate and advance his own position in the NSDAP, Himmler took advantage of the disarray in the party following Hitler's arrest in the wake of the Beer Hall Putsch.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=227}} From mid-1924 he worked under [[Gregor Strasser]] as a party secretary and propaganda assistant. Travelling all over Bavaria agitating for the party, he gave speeches and distributed literature. Placed in charge of the party office in Lower Bavaria by Strasser from late 1924, he was responsible for integrating the area's membership with the NSDAP under Hitler when the party was re-founded in February 1925.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=51}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=70, 81–88}}

That same year, he joined the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) as an SS-Führer (SS-Leader); his SS number was 168.{{sfn|Biondi|2000|p=7}} The SS, initially part of the much larger SA, was formed in 1923 for Hitler's personal protection, and was re-formed in 1925 as an elite unit of the SA.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=228}} Himmler's first leadership position in the SS was that of ''SS-[[Gauführer]]'' (district leader) in Lower Bavaria from 1926. Strasser appointed Himmler deputy propaganda chief in January 1927. As was typical in the NSDAP, he had considerable freedom of action in his post, which increased over time. He began to collect statistics on the number of Jews, [[Freemasons]], and enemies of the party, and following his strong need for control, he developed an elaborate bureaucracy.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=89–92}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|pp=15–16}} In September 1927, Himmler told Hitler of his vision to transform the SS into a loyal, powerful, racially pure elite unit. Convinced that Himmler was the man for the job, Hitler appointed him Deputy ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'', with the rank of ''SS-Oberführer''.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=18}}

Around this time, Himmler joined the [[Artaman League]], a ''[[Völkisch]]'' youth group. There he met [[Rudolf Höss]], who was later commandant of [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], and [[Walther Darré]], whose book, ''The Peasantry as the Life Source of the Nordic Race'', caught Hitler's attention, leading to his later appointment as Reich Minister of Food and Agriculture. Darré was a firm believer in the superiority of the [[Nordic race]], and his philosophy was a major influence on Himmler.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=148}}{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=228}}

{{main article|Machtergreifung}}

Upon the resignation of SS commander [[Erhard Heiden]] in January 1929, Himmler assumed the position of ''Reichsführer-SS'' with Hitler's approval;{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=18}}{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=47}}{{efn|name=note}} he still carried out his duties at propaganda headquarters. One of his first responsibilities was to organise SS participants at the [[Nuremberg Rally]] that September.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=113–114}} Over the next year, Himmler grew the SS from a force of about 290 men to about 3,000. By 1930 Himmler had persuaded Hitler to run the SS as a separate organisation, although it was officially still subordinate to the SA.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=228–229}}{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=17, 19–21}}

To gain political power, the NSDAP took advantage of the economic downturn during the [[Great Depression]]. The coalition government of the [[Weimar Republic]] was unable to improve the economy, so many voters turned to the political extreme, which included the NSDAP.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=9}} Hitler used [[populism|populist]] rhetoric, including blaming scapegoats—particularly the Jews—for the economic hardships.{{sfn|Bullock|1999|p=376}} In the 1932 election, the Nazis won 37.3 percent of the vote and 230 seats in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]].{{sfn|Kolb|2005|pp=224–225}} Hitler was appointed [[Chancellor of Germany]] by President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] on 30 January 1933, heading a short-lived coalition of his Nazis and the [[German National People's Party]]. The new cabinet initially included only three members of the NSDAP: Hitler, [[Hermann Göring]] as [[minister without portfolio]] and Minister of the Interior for [[Prussia]], and [[Wilhelm Frick]] as [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Reich Interior Minister]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=92}}{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=184}} Less than a month later, the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag building was set on fire]]. Hitler took advantage of this event, forcing von Hindenburg to sign the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], which suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=192}} The [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], passed by the Reichstag in 1933, gave the Cabinet—in practice, Hitler—full legislative powers, and the country became a de facto dictatorship.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=199}}  On 1 August 1934, Hitler's cabinet passed a law which stipulated that upon von Hindenburg's death, the office of president would be abolished and its powers merged with those of the chancellor.  Von Hindenburg died the next morning, and Hitler became both head of state and head of government under the title ''Führer und Reichskanzler'' (leader and chancellor).{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=226–227}}

The Nazi Party's rise to power provided Himmler and the SS an unfettered opportunity to thrive. By 1933, the SS numbered 52,000 members.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=20, 22}} Strict membership requirements ensured that all members were of Hitler's [[Aryan race|Aryan]] ''[[Herrenvolk]]'' ("Aryan master race"). Applicants were vetted for Nordic qualities—in Himmler's words, "like a nursery gardener trying to reproduce a good old strain which has been adulterated and debased; we started from the principles of plant selection and then proceeded quite unashamedly to weed out the men whom we did not think we could use for the build-up of the SS."{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=41}} Few dared mention that by his own standards, Himmler did not meet his own ideals.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=52}}

Himmler's organised, bookish intellect served him well as he began setting up different SS departments. In 1931 he appointed [[Reinhard Heydrich]] chief of the new Ic Service (intelligence service), which was renamed the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD: Security Service) in 1932. He later officially appointed Heydrich his deputy.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=17, 23, 151}} The two men had a good working relationship and a mutual respect.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|pp=24, 27}} In 1933, they began to remove the SS from SA control. Along with Interior Minister Frick, they hoped to create a unified German police force. In March 1933, Reich Governor of Bavaria [[Franz Ritter von Epp]] appointed Himmler chief of the Munich Police. Himmler appointed Heydrich commander of Department IV, the [[Bavarian Political Police|political police]].{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=149}} That same year, Hitler promoted Himmler to the rank of SS-''[[Obergruppenführer]]'', equal in rank to the senior SA commanders.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=29}} Thereafter, Himmler and Heydrich took over the political police of state after state; soon only Prussia was controlled by Göring.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=66}}

Himmler further established the [[SS-Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt|SS Race and Settlement Main Office]] (''Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt'' or RuSHA). He appointed Darré as its first chief, with the rank of SS-''[[Gruppenführer]]''. The department implemented racial policies and monitored the "racial integrity" of the SS membership.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=23, 36}} SS men were carefully vetted for their racial background. On 31 December 1931, Himmler introduced the "marriage order", which required SS men wishing to marry to produce family trees proving that both families were of Aryan descent to 1800.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=127, 353}} If any non-Aryan forebears were found in either family tree during the racial investigation, the person concerned was excluded from the SS.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=302}} Each man was issued a ''[[Sippenbuch]]'', a genealogical record detailing his genetic history.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|pp=22–23}} Himmler expected that each SS marriage should produce at least four children, thus creating a pool of genetically superior prospective SS members. The programme had disappointing results; less than 40 per cent of SS men married and each produced only about one child.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=378}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 152-11-12, Dachau, Konzentrationslager, Besuch Himmlers.jpg|thumb|left|Himmler (front right, beside prisoner) visiting the [[Dachau Concentration Camp]] in 1936]]

In March 1933, less than three months after the Nazis came to power, Himmler set up the first official [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] at [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=344}} Hitler had stated that he did not want it to be just another prison or detention camp. Himmler appointed [[Theodor Eicke]], a convicted felon and ardent Nazi, to run the camp in June 1933.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=136, 137}} Eicke devised a system that was used as a model for future camps throughout Germany.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=84}} Its features included isolation of victims from the outside world, elaborate roll calls and work details, the use of force and executions to exact obedience, and a strict disciplinary code for the guards. Uniforms were issued for prisoners and guards alike; the guards' uniforms had a special ''Totenkopf'' insignia on their collars. By the end of 1934, Himmler took control of the camps under the aegis of the SS, creating a separate division, the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverbände]]''.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=151–153}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=84–85}}

Initially the camps housed political opponents; over time, undesirable members of German society—criminals, vagrants, deviants—were placed in the camps as well. A Hitler decree issued in December 1937 allowed for the incarceration of anyone deemed by the regime to be an undesirable member of society.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=87}} This included Jews, [[Romani people|Gypsies]], communists, and those persons of any other cultural, [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]], political, or religious affiliation deemed by the Nazis to be ''[[Untermensch]]'' (sub-human). Thus, the camps became a mechanism for social and racial engineering. By the outbreak of World War II in autumn 1939, there were six camps housing some 27,000 inmates. Death tolls were high.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=86–90}}

=== Consolidation of power ===
In early 1934, Hitler and other Nazi leaders became concerned that Röhm was planning a coup d'état.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=306–309}} Röhm had socialist and populist views, and believed that the real revolution had not yet begun. He felt that the SA—now numbering some three million men, far dwarfing the army—should become the sole arms-bearing corps of the state, and that the army should be absorbed into the SA under his leadership. Röhm [[lobbying|lobbied]] Hitler to appoint him [[defence minister|Minister of Defence]], a position held by conservative General [[Werner von Blomberg]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=24}}

Göring had created a Prussian [[secret police]] force, the ''Geheime Staatspolizei'' or [[Gestapo]] in 1933, and appointed [[Rudolf Diels]] as its head. Göring, concerned that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract the power of the SA, handed over its control to Himmler on 20 April 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=54}} Also on that date, Hitler appointed Himmler chief of all German police outside Prussia. This was a radical departure from long-standing German practice that law enforcement was a state and local matter.  Heydrich, named chief of the Gestapo by Himmler on 22 April 1934, also continued as head of the SD.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=61}}

Hitler decided on 21 June that Röhm and the SA leadership had to be eliminated. He sent Göring to Berlin on 29 June, to meet with Himmler and Heydrich to plan the action. Hitler took charge in Munich, where Röhm was arrested; he gave Röhm the choice to commit suicide or be shot. When Röhm refused to kill himself, he was shot dead by two SS officers. Between 85 and 200 members of the SA leadership and other political adversaries, including Gregor Strasser, were killed between 30 June and 2 July 1934 in these actions, known as the [[Night of the Long Knives]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=308–314}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=31–35, 39}} With the SA thus neutralised, the SS became an independent organisation answerable only to Hitler on 20 July 1934. Himmler's title of ''Reichsführer-SS'' became the highest formal SS rank, equivalent to a [[field marshal]] in the army.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=316}} The SA was converted into a sports and training organisation.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=313}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 152-08-35, Dachau, Konzentrationslager, Besuch Himmlers.jpg|thumb|upright|Himmler and [[Rudolf Hess]] at [[Dachau]] in 1936, viewing a scale model of [[Dachau Concentration Camp|the camp]].]]

On 15 September 1935, Hitler presented two laws—known as the [[Nuremberg Laws]]—to the Reichstag. The laws banned marriage between non-Jewish and Jewish Germans and forbade the employment of non-Jewish women under the age of 45 in Jewish households. The laws also deprived so-called "non-Aryans" of the benefits of German citizenship.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=543–545}} These laws were among the first race-based measures instituted by the Third Reich.

Himmler and Heydrich wanted to extend the power of the SS; thus, they urged Hitler to form a national police force overseen by the SS, to guard Nazi Germany against its many enemies at the time—real and imagined.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|pp=86, 87}} Interior Minister Frick also wanted a national police force, but one controlled by him, with [[Kurt Daluege]] as his police chief.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=77}} Hitler left it to Himmler and Heydrich to work out the arrangements with Frick. Himmler and Heydrich had greater bargaining power, as they were allied with Frick's old enemy, Göring. Heydrich drew up a set of proposals and Himmler sent him to meet with Frick. An angry Frick then consulted with Hitler, who told him to agree to the proposals. Frick acquiesced, and on 17 June 1936 Hitler decreed the unification of all police forces in the Reich, and named Himmler Chief of German Police.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=77}} In this role, Himmler was still nominally subordinate to Frick. In practice, however, the police was now effectively a division of the SS, and hence independent of Frick's control. This move gave Himmler operational control over Germany's entire detective force.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=77}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=204}} He also gained authority over all of Germany's uniformed law enforcement agencies, which were amalgamated into the new ''[[Ordnungspolizei]]'' (Orpo: "order police"), which became a branch of the SS under Daluege.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=77}}

Shortly thereafter, Himmler created the ''[[Kriminalpolizei]]'' (Kripo: criminal police) as the umbrella organisation for all criminal investigation agencies in Germany.  The Kripo was merged with the Gestapo into the ''[[Sicherheitspolizei]]'' (SiPo: security police), under Heydrich's command.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=201}} In September 1939, following the outbreak of World War II, Himmler formed the ''[[SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]'' (RSHA: Reich Main Security Office) to bring the SiPo (which included the Gestapo and Kripo) and the SD together under one umbrella. He again placed Heydrich in command.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=163}}

Under Himmler's leadership, the SS developed its own military branch, the ''[[SS-Verfügungstruppe]]'' (SS-VT), which later evolved into the [[Waffen-SS]]. Nominally under the authority of Himmler, the Waffen-SS developed a fully militarised structure of command and operations. It grew from three regiments to over 38 divisions during World War II, serving alongside the ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'' (army), but never being formally part of it.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=56, 57, 66}}

In addition to his military ambitions, Himmler established the beginnings of a parallel economy under the umbrella of the SS.{{sfn|Sereny|1996|pp=323, 329}} To this end, administrator [[Oswald Pohl]] set up the ''[[Deutsche Wirtschaftsbetriebe]]'' (German Economic Enterprise) in 1940. Under the auspices of the SS Economy and Administration Head Office, this holding company owned housing corporations, factories, and publishing houses.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=343}} Pohl was unscrupulous and quickly exploited the companies for personal gain. In contrast, Himmler was honest in matters of money and business.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=120}}

In 1938, as part of his preparations for war, Hitler ended the [[Sino-German cooperation until 1941|German alliance with China]], and entered into an agreement with the more modern Japan. That same year, Austria was unified with Nazi Germany in the [[Anschluss]], and the [[Munich Agreement]] gave Nazi Germany control over the [[Sudetenland]], part of [[Czechoslovakia]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=641, 653, 674}} Hitler's primary motivations for war included obtaining additional ''[[Lebensraum]]'' ("living space") for the Germanic peoples, who were considered racially superior according to [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=34}} A second goal was the elimination of those considered racially inferior, particularly the Jews and Slavs, from territories controlled by the Reich. From 1933 to 1938, hundreds of thousands of Jews emigrated to the United States, Palestine, Great Britain, and other countries. Some converted to Christianity.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=554–558}}

=== Anti-church struggle ===
{{Main article|Kirchenkampf|Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church}}

Himmler believed that a major task of the SS should be "acting as the vanguard in overcoming Christianity and restoring a 'Germanic' way of living" as part of preparations for the coming conflict between "humans and subhumans".{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=265}} Himmler biographer [[Peter Longerich]] wrote that, while the Nazi movement as a whole launched itself against Jews and Communists, "by linking de-Christianisation with re-Germanization, Himmler had provided the SS with a goal and purpose all of its own".{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=265}} Himmler was vehemently opposed to Christian sexual morality and the "principle of Christian mercy", both of which he saw as dangerous obstacles to his planned battle with "subhumans".{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=265}} In 1937, Himmler declared:

{{quote|We live in an era of the ultimate conflict with Christianity. It is part of the mission of the SS to give the German people in the next half century the non-Christian ideological foundations on which to lead and shape their lives. This task does not consist solely in overcoming an ideological opponent but must be accompanied at every step by a positive impetus: in this case that means the reconstruction of the German heritage in the widest and most comprehensive sense.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=270}}}}

== World War II ==
When Hitler and his army chiefs asked for a [[casus belli|pretext]] for the [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, Himmler, Heydrich, and [[Heinrich Müller (Gestapo)|Heinrich Müller]] masterminded and carried out a [[false flag]] project code-named [[Operation Himmler]]. German soldiers dressed in Polish uniforms undertook border skirmishes which deceptively suggested Polish aggression against Germany. The incidents were then used in [[Nazi propaganda]] to justify the invasion of [[Poland]], the opening event of World War II.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=518–520}} At the beginning of the war against Poland, Hitler authorised the killing of Polish civilians, including Jews and ethnic Poles. The ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' (SS task forces) had originally been formed by Heydrich to secure government papers and offices in areas taken over by Germany before World War II.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=118, 122}} Authorised by Hitler and under the direction of Himmler and Heydrich, the ''Einsatzgruppen'' units—now repurposed as [[death squad]]s—followed the ''Heer'' (army) into Poland, and by the end of 1939 they [[Intelligenzaktion|had murdered some 65,000 intellectuals and other civilians]]. Militias and ''Heer'' units also took part in these killings.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=518, 519}}{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=14–15}} Under Himmler's orders via the RSHA, these squads were also tasked with rounding up Jews and others for placement in [[ghetto]]s and concentration camps.

Germany subsequently invaded [[Operation Weserübung|Denmark and Norway]], [[Battle of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], and [[Battle of France|France]], and began [[Battle of Britain|bombing Great Britain]] in preparation for [[Operation Sea Lion]], the planned invasion of the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=118–145}} On 21 June 1941, the day before [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], Himmler commissioned the preparation of the ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'' (General Plan for the East); the plan was finalised in July 1942. It called for the [[Baltic States]], Poland, [[Western Ukraine]], and [[Belarus|Byelorussia]] to be conquered and resettled by ten million German citizens. The current residents—some 31 million people—would be expelled further east, starved, or used for forced labour. The plan would have extended the border of Germany a thousand kilometres to the east (620 miles). Himmler expected that it would take twenty to thirty years to complete the plan, at a cost of 67 billion [[Reichsmark]]s.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=173–174}} Himmler stated openly: "It is a question of existence, thus it will be a racial struggle of pitiless severity, in the course of which 20 to 30 million Slavs and Jews will perish through military actions and crises of food supply."{{sfn|Cesarani|2004|p=366}}

Himmler declared that the war in the east was a pan-European crusade to defend the traditional values of old Europe from the "Godless [[Bolshevik]] hordes".{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=93, 98}} Constantly struggling with the [[Wehrmacht]] for recruits, Himmler solved this problem through the creation of Waffen-SS units composed of Germanic folk groups taken from the [[Balkans]] and eastern Europe. Equally vital were recruits from among the Germanic considered peoples of northern and western Europe, in the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]] and [[Finland]].{{sfn|Koehl|2004|pp=212–213}} Spain and Italy also provided men for Waffen-SS units.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=81–84}} Among western countries, the number of volunteers varied from a high of 25,000 from the Netherlands{{sfn|van Roekel|2010}} to 300 each from [[Sweden]] and [[Switzerland]]. From the east, the highest number of men came from [[Lithuania]] (50,000) and the lowest from [[Bulgaria]] (600).{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=84, 90}} After 1943 most men from the east were [[conscripts]]. The performance of the eastern ''Waffen-SS'' units was, as a whole, sub-standard.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=94}}

In late 1941, Hitler named Heydrich as Deputy Reich Protector of the newly established [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. Heydrich began to racially classify the Czechs, deporting many to concentration camps. Members of a swelling resistance were shot, earning Heydrich the nickname "the Butcher of Prague".{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=274}} This appointment strengthened the collaboration between Himmler and Heydrich, and Himmler was proud to have SS control over a state. Despite having direct access to Hitler, Heydrich's loyalty to Himmler remained firm.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=225}}

With Hitler's approval, Himmler re-established the ''Einsatzgruppen'' in the lead-up to the planned invasion of the Soviet Union. In March 1941, Hitler addressed his army leaders, detailing his intention to smash the Soviet Empire and destroy the Bolshevik intelligentsia and leadership.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=598, 618}} His special directive, the "Guidelines in Special Spheres re Directive No. 21 (Operation Barbarossa)", read: "In the operations area of the army, the ''Reichsführer-SS'' has been given special tasks on the orders of the ''Führer'', in order to prepare the political administration. These tasks arise from the forthcoming final struggle of two opposing political systems. Within the framework of these tasks, the ''Reichsführer-SS'' acts independently and on his own responsibility."{{sfn|Hillgruber|1989|p=95}} Hitler thus intended to prevent internal friction like that occurring earlier in Poland in 1939, when several German Army generals had attempted to bring ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders to trial for the murders they had committed.{{sfn|Hillgruber|1989|p=95}}

Following the army into the Soviet Union, the ''Einsatzgruppen'' rounded up and killed Jews and others deemed undesirable by the Nazi state.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=958}} Hitler was sent frequent reports.{{sfn|Longerich, Chapter 15|2003}} In addition, 2.8 million [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|Soviet prisoners of war]] died of starvation, mistreatment or executions in just eight months of 1941–42.{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=290}} As many as 500,000 Soviet prisoners of war died or were executed in Nazi concentration camps over the course of the war; most of them were shot or [[Gas chamber|gassed]].{{sfn|POWs: Holocaust Memorial Museum}} By early 1941, following Himmler's orders, ten concentration camps had been constructed in which inmates were subjected to forced labour.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=480–481}} Jews from all over Germany and the occupied territories were deported to the camps or confined to ghettos. As the Germans were pushed back from Moscow in December 1941, signalling that the expected quick defeat of the Soviet Union had failed to materialize, Hitler and other Nazi officials realised that mass deportations to the east would no longer be possible. As a result, instead of deportation, many Jews in Europe were destined for death.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=256}}{{sfn|Longerich, Chapter 17|2003}}

== The Holocaust, racial policy, and eugenics==
{{main|The Holocaust|Nazism and race|Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi eugenics}}
{{The Holocaust sidebar |Responsibility}}

Nazi racial policies, including the notion that people who were racially inferior had no right to live, date back to the earliest days of the party; Hitler discusses this in ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=86}} Somewhere around the time of the [[German declaration of war against the United States|German declaration of war on the United States]] in December 1941, Hitler finally resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be "exterminated."{{sfn|Longerich, Chapter 17|2003}} Heydrich arranged a meeting, held on 20 January 1942 at [[Wannsee Conference|Wannsee]], a suburb of Berlin. Attended by top Nazi officials, it was used to outline the plans for the "[[Final Solution|final solution to the Jewish question]]". Heydrich detailed how those Jews able to work would be [[Extermination through labor|worked to death]]; those unable to work would be killed outright. Heydrich calculated the number of Jews to be killed at 11 million, and told the attendees that Hitler had placed Himmler in charge of the plan.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=264}}

In June 1942, Heydrich was assassinated in [[Prague]] in an operation led by [[Jozef Gabčík]] and [[Jan Kubiš]], members of Czechoslovakia's army-in-exile who had been trained by the British [[Special Operations Executive]].{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=280}} During the two funeral services, Himmler—the chief mourner—took charge of Heydrich's two young sons, and he gave the eulogy in Berlin.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=129}} On 9 June, after discussions with Himmler and [[Karl Hermann Frank]], Hitler ordered brutal reprisals for Heydrich's death.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=280}} Over 13,000 people were arrested, and the village of [[Lidice]] was razed to the ground; its male inhabitants and all adults in the village of [[Ležáky]] were murdered. At least 1,300 people were executed by firing squads.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|pp=280–285}}{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=714}} Himmler took over leadership of the RSHA and stepped up the pace of the killing of Jews in ''Aktion Reinhard'' ([[Operation Reinhard]]), named in Heydrich's honour.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=570–571}} He ordered the ''Aktion Reinhard'' camps—three [[extermination camp]]s—to be constructed at [[Belzec extermination camp|Bełżec]], [[Sobibór extermination camp|Sobibór]], and [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]].{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=282–283}}

Initially the victims were killed with [[gas van]]s or by firing squad, but these methods proved impracticable for an operation of this scale.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=256–257}} In August 1941, Himmler attended the shooting of 100 Jews at [[Minsk]]. Nauseated and shaken by the experience,{{sfn|Gilbert|1987|p=191}} he was concerned about the impact such actions would have on the mental health of his SS men. He decided that alternate methods of killing should be found.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=547}}{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=199}}  On his orders, by early 1942 the camp at Auschwitz had been greatly expanded, including the addition of [[gas chamber]]s, where victims were killed using the pesticide [[Zyklon B]].{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=295, 299–300}} Himmler visited the camp in person on 17 and 18 July 1942. He was given a demonstration of a mass killing using the gas chamber in Bunker 2 and toured the building site of the new [[IG Farben]] plant being constructed at the nearby town of [[Monowitz]].{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=106}} By the end of the war, at least 5.5 million Jews had been killed by the Nazi regime;{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=318}} most estimates range closer to six million.{{sfn|Yad Vashem, 2008}}{{sfn|Introduction: Holocaust Memorial Museum}} Himmler visited the camp at Sobibór in early 1943, by which time 250,000 people had been killed at that location alone. After witnessing a gassing, he gave 28 people promotions, and ordered the operation of the camp to be wound down. In a revolt that October, prisoners killed most of the guards and SS personnel, and 300 prisoners escaped. Two hundred managed to get away; some joined partisan units operating in the area. The remainder were killed. The camp was dismantled by December 1943.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=288–289}}

The Nazis also targeted [[Romani people|Romani]] (Gypsies) as "asocial" and "criminals".{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=229}} By 1935, they were confined into special camps away from ethnic Germans.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=229}} In 1938, Himmler issued an order in which he said that the 'Gypsy question' would be determined by "race".{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=230}} Himmler believed that the Romani were originally Aryan but had become a mixed race; only the "racially pure" were to be allowed to live.{{sfn|Lewy|2000|pp=135-137}} In 1939, Himmler ordered thousands of Gypsies to be sent to the Dachau concentration camp and by 1942, ordered all Romani sent to Auschwitz concentration camp.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=230, 670}}

Himmler was a main architect of the Holocaust,{{sfn|Zentner|Bedürftig|1991|p=1150}}{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=236}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=3}} using his deep belief in the racist Nazi ideology to justify the murder of millions of victims. The Nazis planned to [[Intelligenzaktion|kill Polish intellectuals]] and restrict non-Germans in the General Government and conquered territories to a fourth-grade education.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=429, 451}} The Nazis wanted to breed a [[master race]] of racially pure [[Nordic race#Nazi Nordicism|Nordic Aryans]] in Germany. As an agronomist and farmer Himmler was acquainted with the principles of [[selective breeding]], which he proposed to apply to humans. He believed that he could engineer the German populace, for example, through [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics]], to be Nordic in appearance within several decades of the end of the war.{{sfn|Pringle|2006}}

On 4 October 1943, during a secret meeting with top SS officials in the city of [[Poznań]] (Posen), and on 6 October 1943, in a speech to the party elite—the [[Gau (country subdivision)|Gau]] and Reich leaders—Himmler referred explicitly to the "extermination" (German: ''Ausrottung'') of the Jewish people.{{sfn|Sereny|1996|pp=388–389}} A translated excerpt from the speech of 4 October reads:{{sfn|Posen speech (1943), audio recording}}

{{quote|
I also want to refer here very frankly to a very difficult matter. We can now very openly talk about this among ourselves, and yet we will never discuss this publicly. Just as we did not hesitate [[Night of the Long Knives|on 30 June 1934]], to perform our duty as ordered and put comrades who had failed up against the wall and execute them, we also never spoke about it, nor will we ever speak about it. Let us thank God that we had within us enough self-evident fortitude never to discuss it among us, and we never talked about it. Every one of us was horrified, and yet every one clearly understood that we would do it next time, when the order is given and when it becomes necessary.

I am talking about the "Jewish evacuation": the extermination of the Jewish people. It is one of those things that is easily said. "The Jewish people is being exterminated," every Party member will tell you, "perfectly clear, it's part of our plans, we're eliminating the Jews, exterminating them, ha!, a small matter." And then they turn up, the upstanding 80 million Germans, and each one has his decent Jew. They say the others are all swines, but this particular one is a splendid Jew. But none has observed it, endured it. Most of you here know what it means when 100 corpses lie next to each other, when there are 500 or when there are 1,000. To have endured this and at the same time to have remained a decent person—with exceptions due to human weaknesses—has made us tough, and is a glorious chapter that has not and will not be spoken of. Because we know how difficult it would be for us if we still had Jews as secret saboteurs, agitators and rabble-rousers in every city, what with the bombings, with the burden and with the hardships of the war. If the Jews were still part of the German nation, we would most likely arrive now at the state we were at in 1916 and '17&amp;nbsp;...{{sfn|Posen speech (1943), transcript}}{{sfn|IMT : Volume 29|p=145f}}

Because the Allies had indicated that they were going to pursue criminal charges for German war crimes, Hitler tried to gain the loyalty and silence of his subordinates by making them all parties to the ongoing genocide. Hitler therefore authorised Himmler's speeches to ensure that all party leaders were complicit in the crimes, and could not later deny knowledge of the killings.{{sfn|Sereny|1996|pp=388–389}}

=== Germanization ===
{{main article|Germanization}}
As Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood ([[RKFDV]]) with the incorporated [[Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle|VoMi]] Himmler was deeply involved in the [[Germanization]] program for the East, particularly Poland. As laid out in the General Plan for the East, the aim was to enslave, expel or exterminate the native population and to make ''Lebensraum'' ("living space") for ''Volksdeutsche'' (ethnic Germans). He continued his plans to colonise the east, even when many Germans were reluctant to relocate there, and despite negative effects on the war effort.{{sfn|Cecil|1972|p=191}}{{sfn|Overy|2004|p=543}}

Himmler's racial groupings began with the ''[[Volksliste]]'', the classification of people deemed of German blood. These included Germans who had collaborated with Germany before the war, but also those who considered themselves German but had been neutral; those who were partially "Polonized" but "Germanizable"; and Germans who were of Polish nationality.{{sfn|Overy|2004|p=544}} Himmler ordered that those who refused to be classified as ethnic Germans should be deported to concentration camps, have their children taken away, or be assigned to forced labour.{{sfn|Nicholas|2006|p=247}}{{sfn|Lukas|2001|p=113}} Himmler's belief that "it is in the nature of German blood to resist" led to his conclusion that Balts or Slavs who resisted Germanization were racially superior to more compliant ones.{{sfn|Cecil|1972|p=199}} He declared that no drop of German blood would be lost or left behind to mingle with an "alien race".{{sfn|Overy|2004|p=543}}

The plan also included the [[kidnapping of Eastern European children by Nazi Germany]].{{sfn|Sereny|1999}} Himmler urged:

{{quote|
Obviously in such a mixture of peoples, there will always be some racially good types. Therefore, I think that it is our duty to take their children with us, to remove them from their environment, if necessary by robbing, or stealing them. Either we win over any good blood that we can use for ourselves and give it a place in our people,&amp;nbsp;... or we destroy that blood.{{sfn|Kohn-Bramstedt|1998|p=244}}
}}

The "racially valuable" children were to be removed from all contact with Poles, and raised as Germans, with German names.{{sfn|Sereny|1999}} Himmler declared, "We have faith above all in this our own blood, which has flowed into a foreign nationality through the vicissitudes of German history. We are convinced that our own philosophy and ideals will reverberate in the spirit of these children who racially belong to us."{{sfn|Sereny|1999}} The children were to be adopted by German families.{{sfn|Lukas|2001|p=113}} Children who passed muster at first but were later rejected were taken to [[Kinder KZ]] in  [[Łódź Ghetto]], where most of them eventually died.{{sfn|Sereny|1999}}

By January 1943, Himmler reported that 629,000 ethnic Germans had been resettled; however, most resettled Germans did not live in the envisioned small farms, but in temporary camps or quarters in towns. Half a million residents of the annexed Polish territories, as well as from Slovenia, Alsace, Lorraine, and Luxembourg were deported to the [[General Government]] or sent to Germany as slave labour.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=578–580}} Himmler instructed that the German nation should view all foreign workers brought to Germany as a danger to their German blood.{{sfn|Rupp|1979|p=125}} In accordance with German racial laws, sexual relations between Germans and foreigners were forbidden as ''[[Rassenschande]]'' (race defilement).{{sfn|Majer|2003|pp=180, 855}}

== 20 July plot ==
{{main article|20 July plot}}
On 20 July 1944, a [[Operation Valkyrie|group of German army officers]] led by [[Claus von Stauffenberg]] and including some of the highest-ranked members of the German armed forces attempted to assassinate Hitler, but failed to do so. The next day, Himmler formed a special commission that arrested over 5,000 suspected and known opponents of the regime. Hitler ordered brutal reprisals that resulted in the execution of more than 4,900 people.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|loc=§29}} Though Himmler was embarrassed by his failure to uncover the plot, it led to an increase in his powers and authority.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=696–698}}{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=642}}

General [[Friedrich Fromm]], [[commander-in-chief]] of the Reserve (or Replacement) Army (''[[Ersatzheer]]'') and Stauffenberg's immediate superior, was one of those implicated in the conspiracy. Hitler removed Fromm from his post and named Himmler as his successor. Since the Reserve Army consisted of two million men, Himmler hoped to draw on these reserves to fill posts within the Waffen-SS. He appointed [[Hans Jüttner]], director of the SS Leadership Main Office, as his deputy, and began to fill top Reserve Army posts with SS men. By November 1944 Himmler had merged the army officer recruitment department with that of the Waffen-SS and had successfully lobbied for an increase in the quotas for recruits to the SS.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=698–702}}

By this time, Hitler had appointed Himmler as Minister of the Interior and Plenipotentiary General for Administration (''Generalbevollmächtigter für die Verwaltung'').{{sfn|Lisciotto|2007}} In August 1944 Hitler authorised him to restructure the organisation and administration of the Waffen-SS, the army, and the police services. As head of the Reserve Army, Himmler was now responsible for prisoners of war. He was also in charge of the Wehrmacht penal system, and controlled the development of Wehrmacht armaments until January 1945.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=702–704}}

== Military commander ==
On 6 June 1944 the Western Allied armies landed in northern France during [[Operation Overlord]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1036}} In response, [[Army Group Oberrhein (Germany)|Army Group Upper Rhine]] (''Heeresgruppe Oberrhein'') group was formed to engage the advancing [[United States Army Europe|US 7th Army]] (under command of General [[Alexander Patch]]{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1086}}) and [[First Army (France)|French 1st Army]] (led by General [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny]]) in the [[Alsace]] region along the west bank of the [[Rhine]].{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=715}} In late 1944, Hitler appointed Himmler commander-in-chief of Army Group Upper Rhine.

On 26 September 1944 Hitler ordered Himmler to create special army units, the ''[[Volkssturm]]'' ("People's Storm" or "People's Army"). All males aged sixteen to sixty were eligible for conscription into this militia, over the protests of Armaments Minister [[Albert Speer]], who noted that irreplaceable skilled workers were being removed from armaments production.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1087}} Hitler confidently believed six million men could be raised, and the new units would "initiate a people's war against the invader".{{sfn|''The Battle for Germany'' 2011}} These hopes were wildly optimistic.{{sfn|''The Battle for Germany'' 2011}} In October 1944, children as young as fourteen were being enlisted. Because of severe shortages in weapons and equipment and lack of training, members of the ''Volkssturm'' were poorly prepared for combat, and about 175,000 of them lost their lives in the final months of the war.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=675–678}}

On 1 January 1945 Hitler and his generals launched [[Operation Nordwind|Operation North Wind]] (''Unternehmen Nordwind''). The goal was to break through the lines of the US 7th Army and French 1st Army to support the southern thrust in the [[Ardennes offensive]], the final major German offensive of the war. After limited initial gains by the Germans, the Americans halted the offensive.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=884, 885}} By 25 January, Operation North Wind had officially ended.

On 25 January 1945, in spite of Himmler's lack of military experience, Hitler appointed him as commander of the hastily formed [[Army Group Vistula]] (''Heeresgruppe Weichsel'') to halt the Soviet [[Red Army]]'s [[Vistula–Oder Offensive]] into [[Pomerania]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=891}} Himmler established his command centre at [[Piła|Schneidemühl]], using his special train, ''Sonderzug Steiermark'', as his headquarters. The train had only one telephone line, inadequate maps, and no signal detachment or radios with which to establish communication and relay military orders. Himmler seldom left the train, only worked about four hours per day, and insisted on a daily massage before commencing work and a lengthy nap after lunch.{{sfn|Duffy|1991|p=178}}

General [[Heinz Guderian]] talked to Himmler on 9 February and demanded, that [[Operation Solstice]], an attack from Pomerania against the northern flank of [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] [[Georgy Zhukov]]'s [[1st Belarusian Front]], should be in progress by the 16th. Himmler argued that he was not ready to commit himself to a specific date. Given Himmler's lack of qualifications as an army group commander, Guderian convinced himself that Himmler tried to conceal his incompetence.{{sfn|Ziemke|1968|p=446}} On 13 February Guderian met Hitler and demanded that General [[Walther Wenck]] be given a special mandate to command the offensive by Army Group Vistula. Hitler sent Wenck with a "special mandate", but without specifying Wenck's authority.{{sfn|Ziemke|1968|p=446-447}} The offensive was launched on 16 February 1945, but soon stuck in rain and mud, facing mine fields and strong antitank defenses. That night Wenck was severely injured in a car accident, but it is doubtful that he could have salvaged the operation, as Guderian later claimed. Himmler ordered the offensive to stop on the 18th by a "directive for regrouping".{{sfn|Ziemke|1968|p=447}} Hitler officially ended Operation Solstice on 21 February and ordered Himmler to transfer a corps headquarter and three dvisions to Army Group Center.{{sfn|Ziemke|1968|p=448}}

Himmler was unable to devise any viable plans for completion of his military objectives. Under pressure from Hitler over the worsening military situation, Himmler became anxious and unable to give him coherent reports.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=715–718}} When the counter-attack failed to stop the Soviet advance, Hitler held Himmler personally liable and accused him of not following orders. Himmler's military command ended on 20 March, when Hitler replaced him with General [[Gotthard Heinrici]] as Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Vistula. By this time Himmler, who had been under the care of his doctor since 18 February, had fled to a [[sanatorium]] at Hohenlychen.{{sfn|Duffy|1991|p=241}} Hitler sent Guderian on a forced medical leave of absence, and he reassigned his post as chief of staff to [[Hans Krebs (Wehrmacht general)|Hans Krebs]] on 29 March.{{sfn|Duffy|1991|p=247}} Himmler's failure and Hitler's response marked a serious deterioration in the relationship between the two men.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=891, 913–914}}  By that time, the inner circle of people whom Hitler trusted was rapidly shrinking.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=914}}

=== Peace negotiations ===
In early 1945, the German war effort was on the verge of collapse and Himmler's relationship with Hitler had deteriorated. Himmler considered independently negotiating a peace settlement. His masseur, [[Felix Kersten]], who had moved to Sweden, acted as an intermediary in negotiations with Count [[Folke Bernadotte]], head of the Swedish Red Cross. Letters were exchanged between the two men,{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|pp=230–233}} and direct meetings were arranged by [[Walter Schellenberg]] of the RSHA.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=943–945}}

[[File:Himmler45.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Heinrich Himmler in 1945]]
Himmler and Hitler met for the last time on 20 April 1945—Hitler's birthday—in Berlin, and Himmler swore unswerving loyalty to Hitler. At a military briefing on that day, Hitler stated that he would not leave Berlin, in spite of Soviet advances. Along with Göring, Himmler quickly left the city after the briefing.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=923–925, 943}} On 21 April, Himmler met with [[Norbert Masur]], a Swedish representative of the [[World Jewish Congress]], to discuss the release of Jewish concentration camp inmates.{{sfn|Penkower|1988|p=281}} As a result of these negotiations, about 20,000 people were released in the [[White Buses]] operation.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=724}} Himmler falsely claimed in the meeting that the crematoria at camps had been built to deal with the bodies of prisoners who had died in a typhus epidemic. He also claimed very high survival rates for the camps at Auschwitz and [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]], even as these sites were liberated and it became obvious that his figures were false.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=727–729}}

On 23 April, Himmler met directly with Bernadotte at the Swedish consulate in [[Lübeck]].  Representing himself as the provisional leader of Germany, he claimed that Hitler would be dead within the next few days.  Hoping that the British and Americans would fight the Soviets alongside what remained of the Wehrmacht, Himmler asked Bernadotte to inform General [[Dwight Eisenhower]] that Germany wished to surrender to the West. Bernadotte asked Himmler to put his proposal in writing, and Himmler obliged.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1187}}

Meanwhile, Göring had [[Göring Telegram|sent a telegram]], a few hours earlier, asking Hitler for permission to assume leadership of the ''Reich''—an act that Hitler, under the prodding of [[Martin Bormann]], interpreted as a demand to step down or face a coup. On 27 April, Himmler's SS representative at Hitler's HQ in Berlin, [[Hermann Fegelein]], was caught in civilian clothes preparing to desert; he was arrested and brought back to the ''[[Führerbunker]]''. On the evening of 28 April, the [[BBC]] broadcast a [[Reuters]] news report about Himmler's attempted negotiations with the western Allies. Hitler, who had long considered Himmler to be second only to [[Joseph Goebbels]] in loyalty (he called Himmler "the loyal Heinrich"), flew into a rage at this apparent betrayal. Hitler told those still with him in the bunker complex that Himmler's act was the worst treachery he had ever known and ordered his arrest. Fegelein was court-martialed and shot.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=943–947}}

By this time, the Soviets had advanced to the [[Potsdamerplatz]], only {{convert|300|m|yd|abbr=on}} from the [[Reich Chancellery]], and were preparing to storm the Chancellery.  This report, combined with Himmler's treachery, prompted Hitler to write his [[last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|last will and testament]]. In the testament, completed on 29 April—one day prior to [[death of Adolf Hitler|his suicide]]—Hitler declared both Himmler and Göring to be traitors. He stripped Himmler of all of his party and state offices and expelled him from the Nazi Party.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=724}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=237}}

Hitler named [[Grand Admiral]] [[Karl Dönitz]] as his successor. Himmler met Dönitz in [[Flensburg]] and offered himself as second-in-command. He maintained that he was entitled to a position in [[Flensburg government|Dönitz's interim government]] as ''Reichsführer-SS'', believing the SS would be in a good position to restore and maintain order after the war. Dönitz repeatedly rejected Himmler's overtures{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=733–734}} and initiated peace negotiations with the Allies. He wrote a letter on 6 May—two days before the [[German Instrument of Surrender]]—formally dismissing Himmler from all his posts.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|pp=239, 243}}

== Capture and death ==
[[File:Himmler Dead.jpg|thumb|upright|Himmler's corpse after his suicide by [[cyanide poisoning]], May 1945]]

Rejected by his former comrades and hunted by the Allies, Himmler attempted to go into hiding. He had not made extensive preparations for this, but he carried a forged paybook under the name of Sergeant Heinrich Hitzinger. With a small band of companions, he headed south on 11 May to [[Friedrichskoog]], without a final destination in mind. They continued on to [[Neuhaus (Oste)|Neuhaus]], where the group split up. On 21 May, Himmler and two aides were stopped and detained at a checkpoint set up by former Soviet POWs. Over the following two days, he was moved around to several camps{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=734–736}} and was brought to the British 31st Civilian Interrogation Camp near [[Lüneburg]], on 23 May.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=1, 736}}

The duty officer, Captain Thomas Selvester, began a routine interrogation. Himmler admitted who he was, and Selvester had the prisoner searched. Himmler was taken to the headquarters of the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second British Army]] in Lüneburg, where a doctor conducted a medical exam on him. The doctor attempted to examine the inside of Himmler's mouth, but the prisoner was reluctant to open it and jerked his head away. Himmler then bit into a hidden [[potassium cyanide]] pill and collapsed onto the floor. He was dead within 15 minutes.{{sfn|''Bend Bulletin''|1945}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=1–3}} Shortly afterward, Himmler's body was buried in an [[unmarked grave]] near Lüneburg. The grave's location remains unknown.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=248}}

== Mysticism and symbolism ==
{{main article|Ideology of the SS}}

Himmler was interested in [[mysticism]] and the [[occult]] from an early age. He tied this interest into his racist philosophy, looking for proof of Aryan and Nordic racial superiority from ancient times. He promoted a cult of ancestor worship, particularly among members of the SS, as a way to keep the race pure and provide immortality to the nation.
[[File:Sig runes.svg|thumb|left|90px|The stylised lightning bolts of the SS insignia were based on the [[Armanen runes]] of [[Guido von List]].]] Viewing the SS as an "order" along the lines of the [[Teutonic Knights]], he had them take over the [[Church of the Teutonic Order, Vienna|Church of the Teutonic Order in Vienna]] in 1939. He began the process of replacing Christianity with a new moral code that rejected humanitarianism and challenged the Christian concept of marriage.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=256–273}} The [[Ahnenerbe]], a research society founded by Himmler in 1935, searched the globe for proof of the superiority and ancient origins of the Germanic race.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|p=134}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=50}}

All regalia and uniforms of Nazi Germany, particularly those of the SS, used symbolism in their designs. The [[Runic insignia of the Schutzstaffel|stylised lightning bolt]] logo of the SS was chosen in 1932. The logo is a pair of [[runic alphabets|runes]] from a set of 18 [[Armanen runes]] created by [[Guido von List]] in 1906. The ancient [[Sowilō]] rune originally symbolised the sun, but was renamed "Sig" (victory) in List's iconography.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|p=64}} Himmler modified a variety of existing customs to emphasise the elitism and central role of the SS; an SS naming ceremony was to replace baptism, marriage ceremonies were to be altered, a separate SS funeral ceremony was to be held in addition to Christian ceremonies, and SS-centric celebrations of the [[Summer solstice|summer]] and [[winter solstice]]s were instituted.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|pp=93, 94}}{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|pp=38–45, 48, 49}} The ''[[Totenkopf]]'' (death's head) symbol, used by German military units for hundreds of years, had been chosen for the SS by Schreck.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|p=71}} Himmler placed particular importance on the [[SS-Ehrenring|death's-head rings]]; they were never to be sold, and were to be returned to him upon the death of the owner. He interpreted the deaths-head symbol to mean solidarity to the cause and a commitment unto death.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=287}}

== Relationship with Hitler ==
As second in command of the SS and then Reichsführer-SS, Himmler was in regular contact with Hitler to arrange for SS men as bodyguards;{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=16}} Himmler was not involved with Nazi Party policy-making decisions in the years leading up to the seizure of power.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=20}} From the late 1930s, the SS was independent of the control of other state agencies or government departments, and he reported only to Hitler.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=251}}

Hitler's leadership style was to give contradictory orders to subordinates and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of others. In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. His cabinet never met after 1938, and he discouraged his ministers from meeting independently.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=29}}{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=323}} Hitler typically did not issue written orders, but gave them orally at meetings or in phone conversations; he also had Bormann convey orders.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=377}} Bormann used his position to control the flow of information and access to Hitler,{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=47}} earning him enemies, including Himmler.

Hitler promoted and practised the ''[[Führerprinzip]]''. The principle required absolute obedience of all subordinates to their superiors; thus Hitler viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himself—the infallible leader—at the apex.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=181}} Accordingly, Himmler placed himself in a position of subservience to Hitler, and was unconditionally obedient to him.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=83}} However, he—like other top Nazi officials—had aspirations to one day succeed Hitler as leader of the Reich.{{sfn|Sereny|1996|pp=322–323}} Himmler considered Speer to be an especially dangerous rival, both in the Reich administration and as a potential successor to Hitler.{{sfn|Sereny|1996|pp=424–425}} Speer refused to accept Himmler's offer of the high rank of [[SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer]], as he felt to do so would put him in Himmler's debt and obligate him to allow Himmler a say in armaments production.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=473}}

Hitler called Himmler's mystical and pseudoreligious interests "nonsense".{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=141, 212}} Himmler was not a member of Hitler's inner circle; the two men were not very close, and rarely saw each other socially.{{sfn|Toland|1977|p=869}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=29}} Himmler socialised almost exclusively with other members of the SS.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=80}} His unconditional loyalty and efforts to please Hitler earned him the nickname of ''der treue Heinrich'' ("the faithful Heinrich"). In the last days of the war, when it became clear that Hitler planned to die in Berlin, Himmler left his long-time superior to try to save himself.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=4, 407–408}}

== Marriage and family ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1969-056-55, Heinrich Himmler mit Frau und Tochter Gudrun.jpg|thumb|upright|Himmler with his wife Margarete and daughter [[Gudrun Burwitz|Gudrun]].]]
Himmler met his future wife, [[Margarete Himmler|Margarete Boden]], in 1927. Seven years his senior, she was a nurse who shared his interest in herbal medicine and [[homoeopathy]], and was part owner of a small private clinic. They were married in July 1928, and their only child, [[Gudrun Burwitz|Gudrun]], was born on 8 August 1929.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=17}} The couple were also foster parents to a boy named Gerhard von Ahe, son of an SS officer who had died before the war.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=258}} Margarete sold her share of the clinic and used the proceeds to buy a plot of land in Waldtrudering, near Munich, where they erected a prefabricated house. Himmler was constantly away on party business, so his wife took charge of their efforts—mostly unsuccessful—to raise livestock for sale. They had a dog, Töhle.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=109–110}}

After the Nazis came to power the family moved first to Möhlstrasse in Munich, and in 1934 to [[Tegernsee (lake)|Lake Tegern]], where they bought a house. Himmler also later obtained a large house in the Berlin suburb of [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]], free of charge, as an official residence. The couple saw little of each other as Himmler became totally absorbed by work.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=27}} The relationship was strained.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=109, 374–375}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=40–41}} The couple did unite for social functions; they were frequent guests at the Heydrich home. Margarete saw it as her duty to invite the wives of the senior SS leaders over for afternoon coffee and tea on Wednesday afternoons.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=111}}

[[File:Several images of SS leader Heinrich Himmler with his daughter Gudrun, varies dates.gif|thumb|left|upright|Images of Himmler and Gudrun together]]
[[Hedwig Potthast]], Himmler's young secretary starting in 1936, became his mistress by 1939. She left her job in 1941. He arranged accommodation for her, first in [[Mecklenburg]] and later at [[Berchtesgaden]]. He fathered two children with her: a son, Helge (born 15 February 1942) and a daughter, Nanette Dorothea (born 20 July 1944, Berchtesgaden). Margarete, by then living in [[Gmund am Tegernsee|Gmund]] with her daughter, learned of the relationship sometime in 1941; she and Himmler were already separated, and she decided to tolerate the relationship for the sake of her daughter. Working as a nurse for the [[German Red Cross]] during the war, Margarete was appointed supervisor in [[Military district (Germany)|Military District]] III (Berlin-Brandenburg). Himmler was close to his first daughter, Gudrun, whom he nicknamed ''Püppi'' ("dolly"); he phoned her every few days and visited as often as he could.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=466–68}}

Margarete's diaries reveal that Gerhard had to leave the [[National Political Institutes of Education|National Political Educational Institute]] in Berlin because of poor results. At the age of 16 he joined the SS in [[Brno]] and shortly afterwards went "into battle", He was captured by the Russians but later returned to Germany.{{sfn|Himmler|2007|p=285}}

Hedwig and Margarete both remained loyal to Himmler. Writing to Gebhard in February 1945, Margarete said, "How wonderful that he has been called to great tasks and is equal to them. The whole of Germany is looking to him."{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=732}} Hedwig expressed similar sentiments in a letter to Himmler in January. Margarete and Gudrun left Gmund as Allied troops advanced into the area. They were arrested by American troops in [[Bolzano]], Italy, and held in various internment camps in Italy, France, and Germany. They were brought to Nuremberg to testify at the trials and were released in November 1946. Gudrun emerged from the experience embittered by her alleged mistreatment and has remained devoted to her father's memory.{{sfn|Himmler|2007|p=275}}{{sfn|Sify News|2010}} She later worked for the West German spy agency [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|''Bundesnachrichtendienst'' (BND)]] from 1961 to 1963.{{sfn|''Deutsche Welle''|2018}}

== Historical assessment ==
[[File:Himmler-death-mask.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Death mask]] of Himmler on display in the [[Imperial War Museum]] in London]]

Speer said that though Himmler seemed pedantic and insignificant on the surface, he was a good decision maker, had a talent for selecting highly competent staff, and successfully inserted the SS into every aspect of daily life.{{sfn|Sereny|1996|pp=323–324}} Peter Longerich observes that Himmler's ability to consolidate his ever-increasing powers and responsibilities into a coherent system under the auspices of the SS led him to become one of the most powerful men in the Third Reich.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=747}}

Historian Wolfgang Sauer says that "although he was pedantic, dogmatic, and dull, Himmler emerged under Hitler as second in actual power. His strength lay in a combination of unusual shrewdness, burning ambition, and servile loyalty to Hitler."{{sfn|Sauer, Wolfgang}} Historian Peter Padfield opined that "Himmler&amp;nbsp;... appeared the most powerful man under Hitler. It is impossible to say whether he was in practice, and meaningless to ask, since he was never prepared to use his power directly to change the course of events...".{{sfn|Padfield|2001|p=534}}

Historian [[John Toland (author)|John Toland]] relates a story by Günter Syrup, a subordinate of Heydrich. Heydrich showed him a picture of Himmler and said, "The top half is the teacher but the lower half is the sadist."{{sfn|Toland|1977|p=812}} Historian [[Adrian Weale]] comments that Himmler and the SS followed Hitler's policies, without question or ethical considerations. Himmler accepted Hitler and Nazi ideology, and saw the SS as a chivalric Teutonic order of new Germans. Himmler adopted the doctrine of ''[[Auftragstaktik]]'' ("mission command"), whereby orders were given as broad directives, with authority delegated downward to the appropriate level to carry them out in a timely and efficient manner. Weale states that the SS ideology gave the men a doctrinal framework, and the mission command tactics allowed the junior officers leeway to act on their own initiative to obtain the desired results.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=3, 4}}

In 2008, the German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' described Himmler as one of the most brutal mass murderers in history, and the architect of the Holocaust.{{sfn|Von Wiegrefe|2008}}

The Sanatan Hindu Temple is the only Hindu temple recognised by the Jamaican Government.It was built in mid 1970s by Pandit Munaeshwar Maragh at 114B Hagley Park Road.

'''Iconoclasm'''&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Literally, "image-breaking", from {{lang-grc|[[wikt:εἰκών|εἰκών]] and [[wikt:κλάω|κλάω]]}}. ''Iconoclasm'' may be also considered as a [[back-formation]] from iconoclast (from Greek εἰκοκλάστης). The corresponding Greek word for iconoclasm is εἰκονοκλασία – ''eikonoklasia''.&lt;/ref&gt; is the social belief in the importance of the destruction of [[icon]]s and other images or monuments, most frequently for religious or political reasons. People who engage in or support iconoclasm are called ''iconoclasts'', a term that has come to be applied figuratively to any individual who challenges "cherished beliefs or venerated institutions on the grounds that they are erroneous or pernicious".&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Iconoclast, 2", see also "Iconoclasm" and "Iconoclastic".&lt;/ref&gt; 

Conversely, one who reveres or venerates religious images is called (by iconoclasts) an ''iconolater''; in a [[Byzantine]] context, such a person is called an ''[[iconodule]]'' or ''iconophile''.

The term does not generally encompass the specific destruction of images of a ruler after his death or overthrow (''[[damnatio memoriae]]'').

Iconoclasm may be carried out by people of a different religion, but is often the result of sectarian disputes between factions of the same religion. Within Christianity, iconoclasm has generally been motivated by those who adopt a literal interpretation of the [[Ten Commandments]], which forbid the making and worshipping of "graven images or any likeness of anything".&lt;ref&gt;"You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. 5 You shall not bow down to them or serve them&amp;nbsp;..." (Exodus 20:4–5a, ESV.)&lt;/ref&gt; The later [[Church Fathers]] identified [[Jews]], fundamental iconoclasts, with [[heresy]] and saw deviations from orthodox Christianity and opposition to the veneration of images as heresies that were essentially "Jewish in spirit".&lt;ref name=RobertM1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michael|first1=Robert|title=A history of Catholic antisemitism : the dark side of the church|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-230-11131-8|pages=28–30|edition=1st Palgrave Macmillan pbk.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZnFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=anti-semitism+jews+jewish+heretics+heresy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Wc7_FQaTAj&amp;sig=CzUEubnkVNbs8SedIKEa3US63yg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l7_YVMjmKYX5yQO_m4LIBw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=heretic&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of iconoclasm among Christian branches greatly varies. [[Islam]], in general, tends to be more iconoclastic than Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hs.ias.edu/files/Crone_Articles/Crone_Islam_Judeo-Christianity_and_Byzantine_Iconoclasm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Sunni Islam]] being more iconoclastic than [[Shia Islam]].

==Religious iconoclasm==

===Ancient era===
{{Main|Akhenaten}}
[[File:Amun.JPG|thumb|[[Amun]]]]

In the [[Bronze Age]], the most significant episode of iconoclasm occurred in Egypt during the [[Amarna Period]], when [[Akhenaten]], based in his new capital of [[Akhetaten]], instituted a significant shift in Egyptian artistic styles alongside a campaign of intolerance towards the traditional gods and a new emphasis on a state [[monolatry|monolatristic]] tradition [[Atenism|focused on the god]] [[Aten]], the Sun disk— many temples and monuments were destroyed as a result:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In rebellion against [[Egyptian polytheism|the old religion]] and [[High Priest of Amun|the powerful priests]] of [[Amun]], Akhenaten ordered the eradication of all of Egypt's traditional gods. He sent royal officials to chisel out and destroy every reference to Amun and the names of other deities on tombs, temple walls, and cartouches to instill in the people that the [[Aten]] was the one true god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Akhenaten.aspx |title=Akhenaten |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Public references to Akhenaten were destroyed soon after his death.

Comparing the [[ancient Egypt]]ians with the [[Israelites]], Jan Assmann writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For Egypt, the greatest horror was the destruction or abduction of the cult images.  In the eyes of the [[Israelites]], the erection of images meant the destruction of [[divine presence]]; in the eyes of the Egyptians, this same effect was attained by the destruction of images.  In Egypt, iconoclasm was the most terrible religious crime; in Israel, the most terrible religious crime was [[idolatry]].  In this respect Osarseph alias Akhenaten, the iconoclast, and the [[Golden Calf]], the paragon of idolatry, correspond to each other inversely, and it is strange that [[Aaron]] could so easily avoid the role of the religious criminal.  It is more than probable that these traditions evolved under mutual influence.  In this respect, [[Moses]] and Akhenaten became, after all, closely related.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Assmann, ''From Akhenaten to Moses: Ancient Egypt and Religious Change'', pg. 76, 2014, [[The American University in Cairo Press]], {{ISBN|977-416-631-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Byzantine era===
{{Main|Byzantine Iconoclasm}}
[[File:Clasm Chludov detail 9th century.jpg|thumb|[[Byzantine Iconoclasm]], [[Chludov Psalter]], 9th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usu.edu/markdamen/1320Hist&amp;Civ/slides/14islam/iconoclasm.JPG |title=Byzantine iconoclasm |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Although [[Christian art|widespread use of Christian iconography]] only began as Christianity increasingly spread among gentiles after the legalization of Christianity by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] (c. 312 AD), scattered expressions of opposition to the use of images were reported (e.g. Spanish [[Synod of Elvira]]). The period after the reign of [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian]] (527–565) evidently saw a huge increase in the use of images, both in volume and quality, and a gathering aniconic reaction.

In the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]], government-led iconoclasm began with [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo&amp;nbsp;III]], following what seems to have been a long period of rising [[Aniconism in Christianity|opposition to the use or misuse of images]].  The religious conflict created political and economic divisions in Byzantine society.  It was generally supported by the Eastern, poorer, non-Greek peoples of the Empire&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Mango, ''The Oxford History of Byzantium,'' 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; who had to deal frequently with raids from the new Muslim Empire.  On the other hand, the wealthier Greeks of [[Constantinople]], and also the peoples of the Balkan and Italian provinces, strongly opposed iconoclasm.&lt;ref&gt;Mango, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Byzantine Empire the government had probably been adopting Christian images more frequently. One notable change came in 695, when [[Justinian II]]'s government added a full-face image of Christ on the [[obverse]] of imperial gold coins. The change caused the [[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] to stop his earlier adoption of Byzantine coin types. He started a purely Islamic coinage with lettering only.&lt;ref name="RC"&gt;Robin Cormack, ''Writing in Gold, Byzantine Society and its Icons'', 1985, George Philip, London, {{ISBN|0-540-01085-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A letter by the Patriarch Germanus written before 726 to two Iconoclast bishops says that "now whole towns and multitudes of people are in considerable agitation over this matter" but there is little written evidence of the debate.&lt;ref&gt;C Mango, "Historical Introduction", in Bryer &amp; Herrin, eds., ''Iconoclasm'', pp. 2–3., 1977, Centre for Byzantine Studies, [[University of Birmingham]], {{ISBN|0-7044-0226-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- this should come out since there is a main article on the subject - it just needs to be introduced here
===The first iconoclastic period: 730–787===
Sometime between 726 and 730, the Byzantine Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]] began the iconoclast campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. (ed.) F. GIOIA, ''The Popes – Twenty Centuries of History'', Libreria Editrice Vaticana (2005), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  He ordered the removal of an image of [[Jesus]] prominently placed over the [[Chalke]] gate, the ceremonial entrance to the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]], and its replacement with a cross.  Some of those assigned to the task were killed by a band of [[iconodules]].&lt;ref name="theoph1"&gt;see Theophanes, ''Chronographia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years conflict developed between those who wanted to use the images, claiming that they were "icons" to be "venerated", and the iconoclasts who claimed they were simply idols. [[Pope Gregory&amp;nbsp;III]] "convoked a synod in 730 and formally condemned iconoclasm as heretical and excommunicated its promoters.  The papal letter never reached Constantinople as the messengers were intercepted and arrested in Sicily by the Byzantines".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. (ed.) F. GIOIA, ''The Popes – Twenty Centuries of History'', Libreria Editrice Vaticana (2005), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine&amp;nbsp;V]] convened the [[Council of Hieria]] in 754.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinstitute.org/index.php/chm/eighth-century/icons/ |title=Issue 54: Eastern Orthodoxy &amp;#124; Christian History Magazine |publisher=Chinstitute.org |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 338 bishops assembled concluded, "the unlawful art of painting living creatures blasphemed the fundamental doctrine of our salvation—namely, the Incarnation of Christ, and contradicted the six holy synods&amp;nbsp;... If anyone shall endeavour to represent the forms of the Saints in lifeless pictures with material colours which are of no value (for this notion is vain and introduced by the devil), and does not rather represent their virtues as living images in himself, etc&amp;nbsp;... let him be anathema". This Council claimed to be the legitimate "Seventh Ecumenical Council".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/icono-cncl754.asp |title=Internet History Sourcebooks Project |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Council of Nicaea 787===
[[File:Seventh ecumenical council (Icon).jpg|thumb|An [[icon]] of the [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]] (17th century, [[Novodevichy Convent]], Moscow).]]
{{Main|Second Council of Nicaea}}
In 780, Constantine&amp;nbsp;VI ascended the throne in Constantinople, but being a minor, was managed by his mother Empress [[Irene of Athens|Irene]].  She decided that an ecumenical council needed to be held to address the issue of iconoclasm and directed this request to [[Pope Adrian I]] (772–795) in Rome.  He announced his agreement and called the convention on 1 August 786 in the presence of the Emperor and Empress.  The initial proceedings were interrupted by the violent entry of iconoclast soldiers faithful to the memory of the prior Emperor Constantine&amp;nbsp;V.  This caused the council to be adjourned until a reliable army could be assembled to protect any proceedings. The council was reassembled at [[Nicaea]] 24 September 787.  During those proceedings the following was adopted:

{{quote|... we declare that we defend free from any innovations all the written and unwritten ecclesiastical traditions that have been entrusted to us. One of these is the production of representational art; this is quite in harmony with the history of the spread of the gospel, as it provides confirmation that the becoming man of the Word of God was real and not just imaginary, and as it brings us a similar benefit.  For, things that mutually illustrate one another undoubtedly possess one another's message.

 ... we decree with full precision and care that, like the figure of the honoured and life-giving cross, the revered and holy images, whether painted or made of mosaic or of other suitable material, are to be exposed in the holy churches of God, on sacred instruments and vestments, on walls and panels, in houses and by public ways; these are the images of our Lord, God and saviour, Jesus Christ, and of our Lady without blemish, the holy God-bearer, and of the revered angels and of any of the saintly holy men.  The more frequently they are seen in representational art, the more are those who see them drawn to remember and long for those who serve as models, and to pay these images the tribute of salutation and respectful veneration. Certainly this is not the full adoration in accordance with our faith, which is properly paid only to the divine nature, but it resembles that given to the figure of the honoured and life-giving cross, and also to the holy books of the gospels and to other sacred cult objects.&lt;ref name="Tanner, Norman P. p. 132–136"&gt;Tanner, Norman P., Alberigo, G., Dossetti, J. A., Joannou, P.

===Views in Byzantine iconoclasm===
Accounts of iconoclast arguments are largely found in iconodule writings.  To understand iconoclastic arguments, one must note the main points:
# Iconoclasm condemned the making of any lifeless image (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;painting or statue) that was intended to represent Jesus or one of the saints. The "Epitome of the Definition of the Iconoclastic Conciliabulum" ([[Synod of Hiereia]]) held in 754 declared:&lt;ref name="hieria1"/&gt; 

{{quote|Supported by [[the Holy Scriptures]] and the Fathers, we declare unanimously, in the name of the Holy Trinity, that there shall be rejected and removed and cursed one of the [[Christian Church]] every likeness which is made out of any material and colour whatever by the evil art of painters&amp;nbsp;... If anyone ventures to represent the divine image (χαρακτήρ, ''charaktēr'') of the Word after the Incarnation with material colours, let him be anathema!&amp;nbsp;... If anyone shall endeavour to represent the forms of the Saints in lifeless pictures with material colours which are of no value (for this notion is vain and introduced by the devil), and does not rather represent their virtues as living images in himself, let him be anathema!}}

#  For iconoclasts, the only real religious image must be an exact likeness of the prototype—of the same substance—which they considered impossible, seeing wood and paint as empty of spirit and life.  Thus for iconoclasts the only true (and permitted) "icon" of Jesus was the [[Eucharist]], which was believed to be his body and blood.
#  Any true image of Jesus must be able to represent both his divine nature (which is impossible because it cannot be seen nor encompassed) as well his human nature.  But by making an icon of Jesus, one is separating his human and divine natures, since only the human can be depicted (separating the natures was considered [[nestorianism]]), or else confusing the human and divine natures, considering them one (union of the human and divine natures was considered [[monophysitism]]).
#  Icon use for religious purposes was viewed as an innovation in the Church, a Satanic misleading of Christians to return to pagan practice. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Satan misled men, so that they worshipped the creature instead of the Creator. The Law of Moses and the Prophets cooperated to remove this ruin.&amp;nbsp;... But the previously mentioned demiurge of evil&amp;nbsp;... gradually brought back idolatry under the appearance of Christianity.&lt;ref name="hieria1"&gt;{{citation |title=Epitome of the Iconoclast Council at Hieria, 754 AD |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/icono-cncl754.html |publisher=[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/sbook.html Internet Medieval Sourcebook] |postscript=,}} also available from [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xvi.x.html Christian Classics Ethereal Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was also seen as a departure from ancient church tradition, of which there was a written record opposing religious images.
[[File:Triumph of Orthodoxy.jpg|thumb|288px|Triumph of Orthodoxy]]
The chief theological opponents of iconoclasm were the monks Mansur ([[John of Damascus]]), who, living in Muslim territory as advisor to the Caliph of Damascus, was far enough away from the Byzantine emperor to evade retribution, and [[Theodore the Studite]], abbot of the [[Stoudios]] monastery in Constantinople.  John declared that he did not venerate matter, "but rather the creator of matter".  However he also declared, "But I also venerate the matter through which salvation came to me, as if filled with divine energy and grace". He includes in this latter category the ink in which the gospels were written as well as the paint of images, the wood of the Cross, and the Body and Blood of Jesus.

The iconodule response to iconoclasm included:
#  Assertion that the biblical commandment forbidding images of God had been superseded by the incarnation of Jesus, who, being the Second Person of the Trinity, is God incarnate in visible matter. Therefore, they were not depicting the invisible God, but God as He appeared in the flesh. This became an attempt to shift the issue of the incarnation in their favor, whereas the iconoclasts had used the issue of the incarnation against them.
#  Further, in their view idols depicted persons without substance or reality while icons depicted real persons. Essentially the argument was "all religious images not of our faith are idols; all images of our faith are icons to be venerated". This was considered comparable to [[Old Testament|the Old Testament]] practice of offering burnt sacrifices only to God, and not to any other gods.
#  Moses had been instructed by God according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|25:18–22|NKJV}} to make golden statues of [[cherubim]] angels on the lid of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], and according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|26:31|NKJV}} God instructed Moses to embroider the curtain which separated the [[Holy of Holies]] in the [[Tabernacle]] with cherubim. Moses had also been told by God to embroider the tent walls of the Tabernacle with cherubim angels according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|26:1|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse||Exodus|36:8|NKJV}}.
#  Regarding the written tradition opposing the making and veneration of images, they asserted that icons were part of unrecorded oral tradition (''parádosis'', sanctioned in Christianity as authoritative in doctrine by reference to {{bibleverse|2|Thessalonians|2:15|NKJV}}, [[Basil the Great]], etc.).
#  Arguments were drawn from the miraculous [[Acheiropoieta]], the supposed icon of the Virgin painted with her approval by St.&amp;nbsp;Luke, and other miraculous occurrences around icons, that demonstrated divine approval of Iconodule practices.
#  Iconodules further argued that decisions such as whether icons ought to be venerated were properly made by the church assembled in council, not imposed on the church by an emperor. Thus the argument also involved the issue of the proper relationship between church and state. Related to this was the observation that it was foolish to deny to God the same honor that was freely given to the human emperor.

The first iconoclastic wave happened in [[Wittenberg]] in the early 1520s under reformers [[Thomas Müntzer]] and [[Andreas Karlstadt]]. It prompted [[Martin Luther]], then concealing as ''Junker Jörg'', to intervene.

In contrast to the [[Lutheran]]s who favoured sacred art in their churches and homes,&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamport|first=Mark A.|title=Encyclopedia of Martin Luther and the Reformation|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781442271593|page=138|quote=Lutherans continued to worship in pre-Reformation churches, generally with few alterations to the interior. It has even been suggested that in Germany to this day one finds more ancient Marian altarpieces in Lutheran than in Catholic churches. Thus in Germany and in Scandinavia many pieces of medieval art and architecture survived. Joseph Leo Koerner has noted that Lutherans, seeing themselves in the tradition of the ancient, apostolic church, sought to defend as well as reform the use of images. "An empty, white-washed church proclaimed a wholly spiritualized cult, at odds with Luther's doctrine of Christ's real presence in the sacraments" (Koerner 2004, 58). In fact, in the 16th century some of the strongest opposition to destruction of images came not from Catholics but from Lutherans against Calvinists: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return" (Koerner 2004, 58). Works of art continued to be displayed in Lutheran churches, often including an imposing large crucifix in the sanctuary, a clear reference to Luther's ''theologia crucis''. ...

However, in most cases, civil authorities removed images in an orderly manner in the newly Reformed Protestant cities and territories of Europe. 

Significant iconoclastic riots took place in [[Basel]] (in 1529), [[Zurich]] (1523), [[Copenhagen]] (1530), [[Münster]] (1534), [[Geneva]] (1535), [[Augsburg]] (1537), [[Scotland]] (1559), [[Rouen]] (1560) and [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]] and [[La Rochelle]] (1562).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekSkZXXjVWUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA148 |title=Neil Kamil, ''Fortress of the soul: violence, metaphysics, and material life'', p. 148 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Voracious Idols and Violent Hands|last=Wandel|first=Lee Palmer|publisher=Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|year=1995|isbn=0-521-47222-9|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calvinist iconoclasm in Europe "provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs" in Germany and "antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox" in the Baltic region.&lt;ref name="Marshall2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=The Reformation|date=22 October 2009|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|isbn=9780191578885|page=114|quote=Iconoclastic incidents during the Calvinist 'Second Reformation' in Germany provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs, while Protestant image-breaking in the Baltic region deeply antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox, a group with whom reformers might have hoped to make common cause.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seventeen Provinces]] (now the Netherlands, Belgium and parts of Northern France) were disrupted by widespread Calvinist iconoclasm in the summer of 1566.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: A Concise History of Western Art|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|language=English |isbn=9781424069224|page=254|quote=In an episode known as the Great Iconoclasm, bands of Calvinists visited Catholic churches in the Netherlands in 1566, shattering stained-glass windows, smashing statues, and destroying paintings and other artworks they perceived as idolatrous.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is called the ''[[Beeldenstorm]]'' and began with the destruction of the statuary of the Monastery of [[Saint Lawrence]] in [[Steenvoorde]] after a ''"Hagenpreek"'', or field sermon, by Sebastiaan Matte. Hundreds of other attacks included the sacking of the Monastery of [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony]] after a sermon by Jacob de Buysere. The ''Beeldenstorm'' marked the start of the [[Eighty Years' War|revolution]] against the Spanish forces and [[Roman Catholic Church|the Catholic Church]].

The iconoclastic belief caused havoc throughout [[Europe]]. In 1523, specifically due to the Swiss reformer [[Huldrych Zwingli]], a vast number of his followers viewed themselves as being involved in a spiritual community that in matters of faith should obey neither the visible Church nor lay authorities. According to Peter George Wallace:

{{quote|"Zwingli's attack on images, at the first debate, triggered iconoclastic incidents in [[Zurich]] and the villages under civic jurisdiction that the reformer was unwilling to condone."  And due to this action of protest against authority, "Zwingli responded with a carefully reasoned treatise that men could not live in society without laws and constraint."&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Peter George.

During the [[Reformation in England]] started during the reign of Anglican monarch [[Henry VIII]], and urged on by reformers such as [[Hugh Latimer]] and [[Thomas Cranmer]], limited official action was taken against religious images in churches in the late 1530s. Henry's young son, [[Edward VI]], came to the throne in 1547 and, under Cranmer's guidance, issued Injunctions for Religious Reforms in the same year and in 1550, an [[Act of Parliament]] "for the abolition and putting away of divers books and images".&lt;ref&gt;Heal, Felicity (2005), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mtGoSCVhRFIC&amp;pg=PA264&amp;lpg=PA264&amp;dq=1550+statute+for+abolishing+images&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=19oOGbcpPr&amp;sig=r7TeKMsCL2HThPLGZaWl1p-pUIU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2wq0VIHpG5PA7Abw9IDIDw&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1550%20statute%20for%20abolishing%20images&amp;f=false ''Reformation in Britain and Ireland''], Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-928015-5}} (pp. 263–4)&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[English Civil War]], Bishop [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]] of [[Norwich]] described the events of 1643 when troops and citizens, encouraged by a Parliamentary ordinance against superstition and [[idolatry]], behaved thus:

And what a hideous triumph in the market-place before all the country, when all the mangled organ pipes, vestments, both copes and surplices, together with the leaden cross which had newly been sawn down from the Green-yard pulpit and the service-books and singing books that could be carried to the fire in the public market-place were heaped together.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Muslim iconoclasm===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Umayyad]] --&gt;
{{further|Aniconism in Islam}}
&lt;!-- destruction of another religion's images is not iconoclasm
[[File:Taller Buddha of Bamiyan before and after destruction.jpg|thumb|The taller of the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] in 1963 and in 2008 after destruction]] --&gt;
Within [[Muslim history]], the act of removing idols from the [[Ka'ba]] in Mecca is considered by all believers to be of great symbolic and historical importance.

In general, Muslim societies have [[Aniconism in Islam|avoided the depiction]] of living beings (animals and humans) within such sacred spaces as [[mosque]]s and [[madrasah]]s. This opposition to figural representation is based not on the [[Qur'an]], but on traditions contained within the [[Hadith]]. The prohibition of figuration has not always extended to the secular sphere, and a robust tradition of figural representation exists within [[Islamic art|Muslim art]].&lt;ref name="flood2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flood |first=Finbarr Barry |title=Between cult and culture: Bamiyan, Islamic iconoclasm, and the museum |journal=The Art Bulletin |volume=84 |year=2002 |pages=641–659 |doi=10.2307/3177288}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Western authors have tended to perceive "a long, culturally determined, and unchanging tradition of violent iconoclastic acts" within [[Islamic culture|Islamic society]].&lt;ref name="flood2002"/&gt;

===Early Islam in Arabia===
The first act of Muslim iconoclasm dates to the beginning of Islam, in 630, when the various statues of [[Arabian mythology|Arabian deities]] housed in the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] were destroyed. There is a tradition that Muhammad spared a fresco of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Life of Muhammad.  A translation of Ishaq's "Sirat Rasul Allah".|publisher=Oxford University Press | last=Guillaume | first=Alfred | authorlink=Alfred Guillaume | year=1955 | page=552 | isbn=978-0-19-636033-1 | quote=Quraysh had put pictures in the Ka'ba including two of Jesus son of Mary and Mary (on both of whom be peace!).&amp;nbsp;... The apostle ordered that the pictures should be erased except those of Jesus and Mary. | url=https://archive.org/details/IbnIshaq-SiratRasulAllah-translatorA.Guillaume | accessdate=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act was intended to bring an end to the [[idolatry]] which, in the Muslim view, characterized [[Jahiliyya]].

The destruction of the idols of Mecca did not, however, determine the treatment of other religious communities living under Muslim rule after the expansion of the [[caliphate]]. Most Christians under Muslim rule, for example, continued to produce icons and to decorate their churches as they wished. A major exception to this pattern of tolerance in early Islamic history was the "Edict of Yazīd", issued by the [[Umayyad]] caliph [[Yazid&amp;nbsp;II]] in 722–723.&lt;ref&gt;A. Grabar, ''L'iconoclasme byzantin: le dossier archéologique'' (Paris, 1984), 155–56.&lt;/ref&gt;
This edict ordered the destruction of crosses and Christian images within the territory of the caliphate. Researchers have discovered evidence that the order was followed, particularly in present-day [[Jordan]], where [[archaeological]] evidence shows the removal of images from the mosaic floors of some, although not all, of the churches that stood at this time. But, Yazīd's iconoclastic policies were not continued by his successors, and Christian communities of the Levant continued to make icons without significant interruption from the sixth century to the ninth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = King | first1 = G.

===Egypt===
[[File:Sphinx of Giza 9059.jpg|thumb|The Sphinx profile in 2010, sans nose]]The [[Muhammad Sa'im al-Dahr|missing nose]] on the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] is attributed to iconoclasm by a Sufi Muslim fanatic in the mid-1300s.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;[[al-Maqrīzī]], writing in the 15th century, attributes the damage to [[Muhammad Sa'im al-Dahr]], a Sufi Muslim fanatic from the khanqah of Sa'id al-Su'ada, in 1378.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic conquests===
Certain conquering Muslim armies have used local temples or houses of worship as mosques. An example is [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Istanbul]] (formerly [[Constantinople]]), which was converted into a mosque in 1453. Most icons were desecrated and the rest were covered with plaster. In the 1920s, Hagia Sophia was converted to a museum, and the restoration of the mosaics was undertaken by the American Byzantine Institute beginning in 1932.

More dramatic cases of iconoclasm by Muslims are found in parts of India where [[Hindu]] and Buddhist temples were razed and mosques erected in their place. Aurangzeb destroyed the famous Hindu temples at [[Varanasi]] and [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pauwels|first=Heidi|last2=Bachrach|first2=Emilia|date=2018|title=Aurangzeb as Iconoclast?

A recent act of iconoclasm was the 2001 destruction of the giant [[Buddhas of Bamyan]] by the then [[Taliban]] government of [[Afghanistan]]. The act generated world-wide protests and was not supported by other Muslim governments and organizations. It was widely perceived in the Western media as a result of the Muslim prohibition against figural decoration. Such an account overlooks "the coexistence between the Buddhas and the Muslim population that marveled at them for over a millennium" before their destruction.&lt;ref name="flood2002"/&gt; The Buddhas had twice in the past been attacked by [[Nadir Shah]] and [[Aurengzeb]]. According to the art historian F.B. Flood, analysis of the Taliban's statements regarding the Buddhas suggest that their destruction was motivated more by political than by theological concerns.&lt;ref name="flood2002"/&gt; Taliban spokespeople have given many different [[Buddhas of Bamyan#Destruction|explanations of the motives]] for the destruction.

===''Damnatio memoriae''===
{{main|damnatio memoriae}}
Revolutions and changes of regime, whether through uprising of the local population, foreign invasion, or a combination of both, are often accompanied by the public destruction of statues and monuments identified with the previous regime. This may also be known as ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'', the ancient Roman practice of official obliteration of the memory of a specific individual. Stricter definitions of "iconoclasm" exclude both types of action, reserving the term for religious or more widely cultural destruction. In many cases, such as [[Revolutionary Russia]] or [[Ancient Egypt]], this distinction can be hard to make.

Among Roman emperors and other political figures subject to decrees of ''damnatio memoriae'' were [[Sejanus]], [[Publius Septimius Geta]], and [[Domitian]]. Several Emperors, such as [[Domitian]] and [[Commodus]] had during their reigns erected numerous statues of themselves, which were pulled down and destroyed when they were overthrown.

===Iconoclasm in the French Revolution===
&lt;!-- this should be broken out into a separate article --&gt;
Throughout the radical phase of the [[French Revolution]], iconoclasm was supported by members of the government as well as the citizenry.  Numerous monuments, religious works, and other historically significant pieces were destroyed in an attempt to eradicate any memory of the [[Old Regime]].  At the same time, the republican government felt responsible to preserve these works for their historical, aesthetic, and cultural value.  One way the republican government succeeded in their paradoxical mission of preserving and destroying symbols of the Old Regime was through the development of museums.

During the Revolution, a statue of [[King Louis XV]] in the Paris square which until then bore his name, was pulled down and destroyed. This was a prelude to the [[guillotine|guillotining]] of his successor [[Louis XVI]] in the same site, renamed "Place de la Révolution" (at present [[Place de la Concorde]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Idzerda|first=Stanley J.|year=1954|title="Iconoclasm during the French Revolution"|url=|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=60/1|pages=13–26|via=|doi=10.2307/1842743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] on the column at [[Place Vendôme]], Paris was also the target of iconoclasm several times: destroyed after the [[Bourbon Restoration]], restored by [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]], destroyed during the [[Paris Commune]] and restored by [[Adolphe Thiers]].

===Roland and the Monuments Commission===
The Monuments Commission had a responsibility of preserving art despite its problematic political symbolism. Jean Roland was installed as the Minister of Interior in 1792 and was faced with pressure from the National Convention to destroy symbols of the Old Regime. Roland, given the responsibility of simultaneously preserving and destroying art, found his solution in the form of public museums. The museum served as a representation of France's rich artistic heritage. Roland had an idealistic vision for the opening of the Louvre as a means of showcasing the glory and power of the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Bette W. Oliver. From Royal to National: The Louvre Museum and the Bibliotheque Nationale (Lantham: Lexington Book, 2007), p. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public museums===
The Louvre was first opened to the public on August 10, 1793. Its collection was almost entirely composed of art from the monarchy's collection in Versailles. Although the radical government's official purpose of installing this art was to "avoid favoritism among artists," the paintings were "secretly held in high regard."&lt;ref&gt;Emmet, Kennedy. A Cultural History of the French Revolution. (New Haven: Yale UP, 1989): pp. 221, 223&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics believed that the art from the royalist era was superior to the work of contemporary artists and therefore believed that the works served a greater historical and aesthetic purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Emmet 1989, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; These artistic symbols of "royalty, feudalism, and superstition" lost their significance in the passive and detached environment of the Louvre.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley J. Idzerda, "Iconoclasm during the French Revolution." In The American Historical Review, Vol. 60, No. 1 (Oct., 1954), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The Louvre, along with other French museums, was a compromise between the political push to preserve and destroy art. Consequently, the museum represented one form of iconoclasm, as it destroyed the essence and meaning of artistic images while preserving its physical form. French museums stripped art of its culturally specific meaning, separating the great artworks from their potentially counterrevolutionary context. Subsequently, politically controversial works were allowed to be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. "Of Other Spaces." Diacritics. (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1986): 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the museum freed images from their intended symbolic meaning and allowed French citizens to appreciate the art merely for its aesthetic and technical characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze, Gilles, and Felix Guattari. A Thousand Plateaus. (Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 1987): 212–213.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum houses, defends, preserves, and abstracts by its very nature, and as such, was one of the most significant architectural and conceptual structures to have been conceived in the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;de Certeau, Michel. The Practice of Everyday Life. (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1984): 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the Premier Musée des Monuments opened to the public in the year 1795, having been commissioned in October of 1790 to hold artworks collected by the revolutionary government. It eventually became one of the most popular museums in Europe. Its curator, Alexandre Lenoir, preserved religious sculptures and tombs for his museum. He was able to preserve relics of the feudal system by convincing revolutionary leaders of their stylistic merit, and minimizing reverence toward the societies the works portrayed.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Christopher M., "Alexandre Lenoir and the Musée des monuments français during the French Revolution," French Historical Studies 12, no. 2 (1981): p. 200–222.&lt;/ref&gt; "Revolutionary museums did not so much eliminate meanings as provide new ones." &lt;ref&gt;Greene 1981, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical records compiled by Muslim historian Maulana Hakim Saiyid Abdul Hai attest to the iconoclasm of [[Qutb-ud-din Aybak]]. The first mosque built in Delhi, the "[[Qutb complex#Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque|Quwwat al-Islam]]" was built after the demolition of the Hindu temple built previously by Prithvi Raj and certain parts of the temple were left outside the mosque proper.&lt;ref name="Hai"&gt;Maulana Hakim Saiyid Abdul Hai "Hindustan Islami Ahad Mein" (Hindustan under Islamic rule), Eng Trans by Maulana Abdul Hasan Nadwi.&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern of iconoclasm was common during his reign, although an argument goes that such iconoclasm was motivated more by politics than by religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routes/1200_1299/index_1200_1299.html Index_1200-1299],''Columbia.edu''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ruler of the sultanate, Shams-ud-din [[Iltutmish]], conquered and subjugated the Hindu pilgrimage site [[Varanasi]] in the 11th century and he continued the destruction of Hindu temples and idols that had begun during the first attack in 1194.&lt;ref&gt;

No aspect of Aurangzeb's reign is more cited—or more controversial—than the numerous desecrations and even the destruction of Hindu temples.&lt;ref name="Aurangzeb"&gt;[http://www.the-south-asian.com/Dec2000/Aurangzeb.htm The South Asian] ''Aurangzeb profile''.&lt;/ref&gt; During his reign, tens of thousands of temples were desecrated: their facades and interiors were defaced and their murtis (divine images) looted.&lt;ref name="Aurangzeb"/&gt; In many cases, temples were destroyed entirely; in numerous instances mosques were built on their foundations, sometimes using the same stones. Among the temples Aurangzeb destroyed were two that are most sacred to Hindus, in [[Varanasi]] and [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]].&lt;ref name="Mughaltemples"&gt;[http://www.hindunet.org/hindu_history/modern/temple_aurangzeb.html Rajiv Varma] ''Destruction of Hindu Temples by Aurangzeb.&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, he had large mosques built on the sites.&lt;ref name="Aurangzeb"/&gt;

[[File:Benares well.jpg|thumb|The original holy well – Gyanvapi in between temple and mosque.]]
The [[Kesava Deo]] temple in [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], marked the place that Hindus believe was the birthplace of Shri [[Krishna]].&lt;ref name="Mughaltemples"/&gt; In 1661 Aurangzeb ordered the demolition of the temple, and constructed the Katra Masjid mosque. Traces of the ancient Hindu temple can be seen from the back of the mosque. Aurangzeb also destroyed what was the most famous temple in [[Varanasi]] – the [[Vishwanath Temple]].&lt;ref name="Mughaltemples"/&gt;

The temple had changed its location over the years, and in 1585 [[Akbar]] had authorized its location at Gyan Vapi. Aurangzeb ordered its demolition in 1669 and constructed a mosque on the site, whose minarets stand 71&amp;nbsp;metres above the Ganges. Traces of the old temple can be seen behind the mosque. Centuries later, emotional debate about these wanton acts of cultural desecration continues. [[Aurangzeb]] also destroyed the [[Somnath]] temple in 1706.&lt;ref name="Mughaltemples"/&gt;

[[Hindu nationalists]] claim that Mughals destroyed the [[Ram Janmabhoomi|Ram Mandir]] in [[Ayodhya]], located at the birthplace of [[Rama]], and built the [[Babri Masjid]] on the holy site, which has since been a source of tension between the Hindu and Muslim communities.

Writer Fernand Braudel wrote in ''A History of Civilizations'' (Penguin 1988/1963, pp.&amp;nbsp;232–236), Islamic rule in India as a "colonial experiment" was "extremely violent", and "the Muslims could not rule the country except by systematic terror. Cruelty was the norm – burnings, summary executions, crucifixions or impalements, inventive tortures. Hindu temples were destroyed to make way for mosques. On occasion there were forced conversions. If ever there were an uprising, it was instantly and savagely repressed: houses were burned, the countryside was laid waste, men were slaughtered and women were taken as slaves."

===During Goa inquisitions===
Diago de Boarda, a priest, and his advisor Vicar General, Miguel Vaz, had made a 41-point plan for torturing Hindus. Under this plan Viceroy Antano de Noronha issued in 1566, an order applicable to the entire area under Portuguese rule:&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgweb.org/unethicalconversion/GoaInquisition.htm |title=The Goa Inquisition by Christian Historian Dr. T. R. de Souza |publisher=Vgweb.org |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I hereby order that in any area owned by my master, the king, nobody should construct a Hindu temple and such temples already constructed should not be repaired without my permission. If this order is transgressed, such temples shall be, destroyed and the goods in them shall be used to meet expenses of holy deeds, as punishment of such transgression.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1567 the campaign of destroying temples in Bardez met with success. At the end of it 300 Hindu temples were destroyed. In 1583 Hindu temples at [[Assolna]] and [[Cuncolim]] were destroyed through army action.&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The fathers of the Church forbade the Hindus under terrible penalties the use of their own sacred books, and prevented them from all exercise of their religion. They destroyed their temples, and so harassed and interfered with the people that they abandoned the city in large numbers, refusing to remain any longer in a place where they had no liberty, and were liable to imprisonment, torture and death if they worshipped after their own fashion the gods of their fathers&lt;/blockquote&gt;,

wrote [[Filippo Sassetti]], who was in India from 1578 to 1588.&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"/&gt;

An order was issued in June 1684 eliminating the [[Konkani language]] and making it compulsory to speak [[Portuguese language]].  Following that law all the symbols of non-Christian sects were destroyed and the books written in local languages were burnt.&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"/&gt;

On December 6, 1992, a large crowd of Hindu Karsevaks (volunteers) entirely destroyed the 16th-century Babri mosque in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India, in an attempt to reclaim the land known as Ram Janmabhoomi.

===In Pakistan===
{{Further|Decline of Hinduism in Pakistan}}
Several Hindu temples have been destroyed in Pakistan. A notable incident was the destruction of the [[Ramna Kali Mandir]] in former [[East Pakistan]]. The temple was bulldozed by the Pakistani Army on March 27, 1971. The [[Dhakeshwari Temple]] was severely damaged during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], and over half of the temple's buildings were destroyed. In a major disrespect of the religion, the main worship hall was taken over by the [[Pakistan]] Army and used as an ammunitions storage area. Several of the temple custodians were tortured and killed by the Army though most, including the Head Priest, fled first to their ancestral villages and then to India and therefore escaped death.

In 2006 the last Hindu temple in [[Lahore]] was destroyed to pave the way for construction of a multi-story commercial building. The temple was demolished after officials of the Evacuee Property Trust Board concealed facts from the board chairman about the nature of the building. When reporters from Pakistan-based newspaper ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'' tried to cover the incident, they were accosted by the henchmen of the property developer, who denied that a Hindu temple existed at the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2006/05/28/nat23.htm Another temple is no more], ''Dawn''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several political parties in Pakistan have objected to this move, such as the Pakistan People's Party and the Pakistani Muslim League-N.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.rediff.com/news/2006/jun/13temple.htm Hindu temple in Lahore demolished],''Rediff.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-06-13/pakistan/27788614_1_hindu-temple-hindus-and-sikhs-eptb Only Hindu Temple in Lahore demolished],''Times of India''.&lt;/ref&gt; The move has also evoked strong condemnation in India from minority bodies and political parties, including the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]], as well as Muslim advocacy political parties such as the All India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1651762.cms India protests demolition of Hindu temple in Pak], ''Times of India''.&lt;/ref&gt; A firm of lawyers representing the Hindu minority has approached the Lahore High Court seeking a directive to the builders to stop the construction of the commercial plaza and reconstruct the temple at the site. The petitioners maintain that the demolition violates section 295 of the Pakistan Penal Code prohibiting the demolition of places of worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/06/06/16/10047337.html Order for temple's reconstruction sought],''Gulf News''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2005, following the arrest of an illiterate Christian janitor on allegations of allegedly burning Qur'an pages, a mob of between 300 and 500 Muslims destroyed a Hindu temple and houses belonging to Christian and Hindu families in [[Nowshera, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa|Nowshera]]. Under the terms of a deal negotiated between Islamic religious leaders and the Hindu/Christian communities, Pakistani police later released all previously arrested perpetrators without charge.&lt;ref name="usdep"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71443.htm |title=US Department of State International Religious Freedom Report 2006 |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Malaysia===
Between April to May 2006, several Hindu temples were demolished by city hall authorities in the country, accompanied by violence against Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysiakini.com/opinionsfeatures/52600 Temple row – a dab of sensibility please], ''malaysiakini.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 21, 2006, the Malaimel Sri Selva Kaliamman Temple in Kuala Lumpur was reduced to rubble after the city hall sent in bulldozers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gatago.com/talk/politics/mideast/12428067.html Muslims Destroy Century-Old Hindu Temple,''gatago.com'']&lt;/ref&gt; Many Hindu advocacy groups have protested what they allege is a systematic plan of temple cleansing in Malaysia. The official reason given by the Malaysian government has been that the temples were built "illegally". However, several of the temples are centuries old.&lt;ref name="Finexp"&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 Hindu group protests "temple cleansing" in Malaysia], ''Financial Express''.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 11, 2006, armed city hall officers from [[Kuala Lumpur]] forcefully demolished part of a 60-year-old suburban temple that serves more than 1,000 Hindus.&lt;ref name="Finexp"/&gt;

===In Saudi Arabia===
On March 24, 2005, [[Government of Saudi Arabia|Saudi authorities]] destroyed religious items found in a raid on a makeshift Hindu shrine found in an apartment in [[Riyadh]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Paul. ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060522223359/http://www.freedomhouse.org/religion/news/bn2005/bn-2005-00-16.htm Saudi Arabia's Religious Police Crack Down]''. Freedom House.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Fiji===
In Fiji according to official reports, attacks on Hindu institutions increased by 14% compared to 2004. This intolerance of Hindus has found expression in anti-Hindu speeches and destruction of temples, the two most common forms of immediate and direct violence against Hindus. Between 2001 and April 2005, one hundred cases of temple attacks have been registered with the police. The alarming increase of temple destruction has spread fear and intimidation among the Hindu minorities and has hastened immigration to neighboring Australia and New Zealand. Organized religious institutions, such as the Methodist Church of Fiji, have repeatedly called for the creation of a theocratic Christian State and have propagated anti-Hindu sentiment.&lt;ref name="Hindusin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hafsite.org/pdf/hhr_2005_html/fijiislands.htm |title=Hindus in South Asia and the Diaspora: A Survey of Human Rights 2005 |publisher=Hafsite.org |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; State favoritism of Christianity, and systematic attacks on temples, are some of the greatest threats faced by Fijian Hindus. Despite the creation of a human rights commission, the plight of Hindus in Fiji continues to be precarious.&lt;ref name="Hindusin" /&gt;
 --&gt;

===Chinese iconoclasm===
{{further|Anti-Western sentiment in China}}
There have been [[Four Buddhist Persecutions in China|a number of anti-Buddhist campaigns]] in [[Chinese history]] that led to the destruction of [[Buddhist temple]]s and images. One of the most notable of these campaigns was the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution]] of the [[Tang dynasty]].

During and after the [[Xinhai Revolution]], there was widespread destruction of religious and secular images in [[China]].

During the [[Northern Expedition]] in [[Guangxi]] in 1926, [[Kuomintang]] General [[Bai Chongxi]] led his troops in destroying Buddhist temples and smashing Buddhist images, turning the temples into schools and Kuomintang party headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=accused+chiang+feudal&amp;q=muslim#v=onepage&amp;q=pai%20smashing%20idols%20decapitating%20statues&amp;f=false|title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925–1937|author=Diana Lary|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|page=98|isbn=0-521-20204-3|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that almost all of the [[vihara]]s in Guangxi were destroyed and the [[bhikkhu|monks]] were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LxDUeWdMubkC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=bai+chongxi+buddhist+temples#v=onepage&amp;q=bai%20chongxi%20buddhist%20temples&amp;f=false|title=Toward a modern Chinese Buddhism: Taixu's reforms|author=Don Alvin Pittman|year=2001|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=|page=146|isbn=0-8248-2231-5|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bai also led a wave of anti-foreignism in Guangxi, attacking Americans, Europeans, and other foreigners, and generally making the province unsafe for foreigners and [[missionaries]]. Westerners fled from the province and some [[Chinese Christians]] were also attacked as imperialist agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=accused+chiang+feudal&amp;q=muslim#v=snippet&amp;q=missionary%20crowd&amp;f=false|title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925–1937|author=Diana Lary|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|page=99|isbn=0-521-20204-3|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three goals of the movement were anti-foreignism, [[anti-imperialism]] and [[anti-religion]]. Bai led the anti-religious movement against [[superstition]]. [[Huang Shaohong]], also a Kuomintang member of the [[New Guangxi clique]], supported Bai's campaign. The anti-religious campaign was agreed upon by all Guangxi Kuomintang members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=accused+chiang+feudal&amp;q=muslim#v=onepage&amp;q=pai's%20as%20a%20moslem%20other%20religions&amp;f=false|title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925–1937|author=Diana Lary|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|page=99|isbn=0-521-20204-3|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was extensive destruction of religious and secular imagery in [[Tibet]] after it was [[Chinese expedition to Tibet (1910)|invaded]] and [[occupation of Tibet|occupied]] by China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-9376-6_23|title=The Changing World Religion Map|last=Karan|first=P. P.|date=2015|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|isbn=9789401793759|pages=461–476|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-017-9376-6_23.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many religious and secular images were destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]] of 1966-1976, ostensibly because they were a holdover from China's traditional and capitalist past (which the Communist regime led by [[Mao Zedong]] reviled). The Cultural Revolution included widespread destruction of historic artworks in public places and private collections, whether religious or secular. Objects in state museums were mostly left intact.

===Iconoclasm in Eastern Europe===
[[File:Christ saviour explosion.jpg|thumb|Demolition of the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], [[Moscow]], 5 December 1931]]
During and after the [[October Revolution]], widespread destruction of religious and secular imagery took place, as well as the destruction of imagery related to [[House of Romanov|the Imperial family]]. The Revolution was accompanied by destruction of monuments of past [[tsar]]s, as well as the destruction of [[Coat of arms of Russia|imperial eagles]] at various locations throughout [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. According to Christopher Wharton, "In front of a Moscow cathedral, crowds cheered as the enormous statue of Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander&amp;nbsp;III]] was bound with ropes and gradually beaten to the ground. After a considerable amount of time, the statue was decapitated and its remaining parts were broken into rubble".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Wharton, [http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=2514&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4797 "The Hammer and Sickle: The Role of Symbolism and Rituals in the Russian Revolution"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528035402/http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=2514&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4797 |date=2010-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]] actively destroyed religious sites, including [[Russian Orthodox]] churches and [[Jewish cemeteries]], in order to discourage religious practice and curb the activities of religious groups.
 
During the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and during the [[Revolutions of 1989]], protesters often attacked and took down sculptures and images of [[Joseph Stalin]], such as the [[Stalin Monument (Budapest)|Stalin Monument]] in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Auyezov|first=Olzhas|title=Ukraine says blowing up Stalin statue was terrorism|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/05/us-ukraine-stalin-idUSTRE7043D920110105|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=9 April 2011|date=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of communism in 1989 was also followed by the destruction or removal of statues of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and other Communist leaders in the [[former Soviet Union]] and in other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. Particularly well-known was the destruction of "[[Felix Dzerzhinsky#Iron Felix|Iron Felix]]", the statue of [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]] outside the [[KGB]]'s headquarters. Another statue of Dzerzhinsky was destroyed in a [[Warsaw]] square that was named after him during [[communist Poland|communist rule]], but which is now called [[Bank Square, Warsaw|Bank Square]].

Other examples of political destruction of images include:
* During the [[American Revolution]], the [[Sons of Liberty]] pulled down and destroyed the [[gilding|gilded]] lead statue of [[George&amp;nbsp;III of the United Kingdom]] on [[Bowling Green (New York City)]], melting it down to be recast as [[Musket#Ammunition|ammunition]]. Similar acts have accompanied the independence of most ex-colonial territories.  Sometimes relatively intact monuments are moved to a collected display in a less prominent place, as in India and also post-Communist countries.
* From the 16th through the 19th centuries, many of the polytheistic religious deities and texts of pre-colonial Americas, Oceania and Africa were destroyed by Christian missionaries and their converts, such as during the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] and the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]].
* In 1942 the pro-Nazi [[Vichy France|Vichy Government of France]] took down and melted Clothilde Roch's statue of the 16th-century dissident  intellectual [[Michael Servetus]], who had been burned at the stake in [[Geneva]] at the instigation of [[John Calvin|Calvin]]. The Vichy authorities disliked the statue, as it was a celebration of freedom of conscience. In 1960, having found the original molds, the municipality of Annemasse had it recast and returned the statue to its previous place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Goldstone, Nancy Bazelon |author2=Goldstone, Lawrence |title=Out of the Flames: The Remarkable Story of a Fearless Scholar, a Fatal Heresy, and One of the Rarest Books in the World |publisher=Broadway |location=New York |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-7679-0837-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}pp. 313-316&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islam]] is the fourth-largest religion in [[Ukraine]], representing 0.6%–0.9% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://razumkov.org.ua/ukr/poll.php?poll_id=300|script-title=uk:Соціологічне опитування - Релігія: Віруючим якої церкви, конфесії Ви себе вважаєте?|trans-title=Sociological survey - Religion: Believers, which churches do you consider yourself to adherents of?|language=uk|work=[[Razumkov Centre]]|date=2006|accessdate=27 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408220038/http://razumkov.org.ua/ukr/poll.php?poll_id=300|archivedate=8 April 2014|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Górak-Sosnowska2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yarosh|first1=Oleg|last2=Brylov|first2=Denys|editor=Katarzyna Górak-Sosnowka|title=Muslims in Poland and Eastern Europe: Widening the European Discourse on Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCAU6Bz5QIEC&amp;pg=PA252|accessdate=27 May 2016|year=2011|publisher=Katarzyna Górak-Sosnowska|isbn=978-83-903229-5-7|pages=252–265|chapter=Muslim communities and Islamic network institutions in Ukraine: contesting authorities in shaping Islamic localities}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religion has a long history in Ukraine dating back to the establishment of the [[Crimean Khanate]] in the 15th century.

[[Sunni Islam]] of the [[Hanafi]] school is the largest non-Christian religion in Ukraine, and the majority of Ukrainian [[Muslim]]s are [[Crimean Tatars]]. Other [[Turkic peoples]] indigenous to Ukraine, predominantly found in South and south-east Ukraine, practice other forms of Islam. These include [[Volga Tatars]], [[Azerbaijanis|Azeris]], [[Peoples of the Caucasus|North Caucasian ethnic groups]] and [[Uzbeks]].&lt;ref name="Górak-Sosnowska2011"/&gt; In 2012 an estimated 500,000 Muslims lived in Ukraine, including 300,000 Crimean Tatars.&lt;ref name="FreedomReport2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2012/eur/208378.htm |title=2012 Report on International Religious Freedom - Ukraine |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |date=20 May 2013 |accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016 [[Said Ismagilov]], the mufti of [[Religious Administration of Muslims of Ukraine|Ummah]], counted one million Muslims in Ukraine.&lt;ref name=kpumf16/&gt;

While there is no general governing structure for Muslims in Ukraine, mono-ethnic communities in multi-ethnic regions are served by their ethnic institutions and supported by their international counterparts. The major Islamic institutions supporting communities are found in [[Kiev]], [[Crimea]], [[Simferopol]] and [[Donetsk]]. Independent [[Salafi movement|Salafi]] communities are also found in Kiev and Crimea, as well as [[Shia Islam|Shia]] communities in Kiev, [[Kharkiv]] and [[Luhansk]].&lt;ref name="Górak-Sosnowska2011"/&gt;

==History of Muslims in Ukraine==
While ethnic [[Ukrainians]] are predominantly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Uniate]] Christians, Muslims have lived in the territory that makes up modern Ukraine for centuries. Muslim settlements are concentrated in the country's southern half, particularly in Crimea, although there are [[Lipka Tatars]] colonies in other regions such as [[Volhynia]] and [[Podolia]].

The history of Islam in Ukraine is associated with the Crimean Tatars, the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] speaking descendants of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and non-Turkic peoples who had settled in Eastern Europe as early as the 7th century. They established the [[Crimean Khanate]] in southern Ukraine in the 15th century. The Khanate soon lost its sovereignty and fell under the influence of the [[Ottoman Empire]], although its local rulers retained a significant degree of autonomy. From the 15th to the 18th centuries, Crimean Tatars frequently raided Eastern Slavic lands to capture their inhabitants, enslaving an estimated three million people, predominantly Ukrainians.&lt;ref name="matsuki"&gt;{{cite journal|format=PDF|first=Eizo|last=Matsuki|url=http://www2.econ.hit-u.ac.jp/~areastd/mediterranean/mw/pdf/18/10.pdf|title=The Crimean Tatars and their Russian-Captive Slaves: An Aspect of Muscovite-Crimean Relations in the 16th and 17th Centuries|journal=Mediterranean world|publisher=Hitotsubashi University, Mediterranean Studies Group|volume=18|pages=171-182|date=March 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605131551/http://www.econ.hit-u.ac.jp/~areastd/mediterranean/mw/pdf/18/10.pdf|archivedate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mikhail|last=Kizilov |title=Slave Trade in the Early Modern Crimea From the Perspective of Christian, Muslim, and Jewish Sources |url=https://www.academia.edu/2971600/Slave_Trade_in_the_Early_Modern_Crimea_From_the_Perspective_of_Christian_Muslim_and_Jewish_Sources |work=Oxford University|pages=2–7.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Slaves, Arab Masters|url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=17747|publisher=Frontpage Magazine|date=18 April 2005|author=Andrew G.

The Crimean Tatars were [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]], and their [[mufti]] was regarded as the highest religious figure. Tatar communities were led and represented by local [[imam]]s.

At the time the Khanate was annexed by Russia, its capital of [[Bakhchysarai]] had at least 18 mosques along with several [[madrassa]]s. However, the Russian Empire began persecuting the Muslim population, and nearly 160,000 Tatars were forced to leave Crimea.{{when|date=December 2014}}{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===20th century===
{{further|Deportation of the Crimean Tatars}}
At the time of the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, Muslims constituted one-third of Crimea's population. Nearly all major cities in Crimea had significant Muslim populations.

Crimean Muslims were subjected to [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|mass deportation]] in 1944 when [[Joseph Stalin]] accused them of collaborating with [[Nazi Germany]]. More than 200,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.iccrimea.org/scholarly/jopohl.html|title=The Deportation and Fate of the Crimean Tatars|first=Otto J.|last=Pohl|conference=5th Annual World Convention of the Association for the Study of Nationalities: "Identity and the State: Nationalism and Sovereignty in a Changing World"|location=[[Columbia University]], New York|date=April 2000|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crimean Tatars were deported to [[Central Asia]], primarily the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbek SSR]]. It is estimated that more than 100,000 deportees died of starvation or disease due to the deportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thailand.mfa.gov.ua/en/press-center/publications/2447-do-70-kh-rokovin-deportaciji-krimsykih-tatar|title=To the 71st Anniversary of Crimean Tatars deportation - Publications - Embassy of Ukraine in the Kingdom of Thailand|author=|date=|website=mfa.gov.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property and territory abandoned by Crimean Tatars was appropriated by the mostly ethnic [[Russians]] who were resettled by the Soviet authorities, leading to large demographic changes in Crimea. Although a 1967 Soviet decree removed the wartime collaboration charges against Crimean Tatars, the Soviet government did nothing to facilitate their resettlement in Crimea, and the repatriation of Crimean Tatars to their homeland only began in 1989.

==Ukrainian Muslims today==
[[File:Mariupol 2007 (133).jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Sultan Suleiman Mosque]] in [[Mariupol]].]]
Since the [[History of Ukraine#ndependence (1991)|Ukrainian independence]] in 1991, the return of Crimean Tatars to Crimea has increased compared to the Soviet era. Although Ukraine's Muslim population consists of various ethnic groups, the majority are of Tatar origin. There has also been a proportionally small settlement of Muslim [[Chechen refugees]] in Crimea and other parts of Ukraine.

Muslims in [[Ukraine]] have 445 communities, 433 ministers, and 160 mosques, with many more mosques currently being built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamyat.org/ Spiritual Administration of Muslims of Ukraine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of the Ukrainian Muslim population vary. Muslims make up only approximately 0.9% of the Ukrainian population, but as much as 12% in Crimea.{{cn|date=January 2017}} According to the 2000 census Ukraine was home to 248,193 Crimean Tatars, 73,304 [[Volga Tatars]], 45,176 [[Azeris]], 12,353 [[Uzbeks]], 8,844 [[Turkish people|Turks]], 6,575 [[Arabs]] and 5,526 [[Kazakhs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/nationality/|title=About number and composition population of Ukraine by data: All-Ukrainian population census 2001 data|publisher=[[State Statistics Committee of Ukraine]]|date=2003|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua/g/d5_other.gif|script-title=uk:Інші національності за даними переписів населення|trans-title=Other nationalities according to population data from censuses|language=uk|publisher=State Statistics Committee of Ukraine|date=2003|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 Freedom Report estimating a Muslim population of 500,000 in Ukraine, including 300,000 Crimean Tatars.&lt;ref name="FreedomReport2012"/&gt; A 2011 Pew Forum study estimated a Ukrainian Muslim population of 393,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/The-Future-of-the-Global-Muslim-Population.aspx|title=The Future of the Global Muslim Population|author=|date=27 January 2011|website=pewforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[Clerical Board of Ukraine's Muslims]] claimed there were two million Muslims in Ukraine as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamyat.org/islam-v-ukraine/islam-v-ukraine.html|script-title=ru:Ислам в Украине|trans-title=Islam in Ukraine|language=ru|work=Islamyat.org|date=26 June 2009|accessdate=5 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205004134/http://www.islamyat.org/islam-v-ukraine/islam-v-ukraine.html|archivedate=5 December 2011|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Said Ismagilov, the mufti of [[Religious Administration of Muslims of Ukraine|Ummah]], in February 2016 one million Muslims lived in Ukraine.&lt;ref name=kpumf16/&gt;

Muslims have formed three structures for running their affairs. These are:
* [[Clerical Board of Ukraine's Muslims]]
* [[The Spiritual Centre of the Muslim Communities]]
* [[Clerical Board of Crimea Muslims]]
* [[Religious Administration of Muslims of Ukraine]]

Most Ukrainian Muslims affiliate to these organizations, which help them join mainstream Islamic and Ukrainian daily life.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} There are nearly 360 registered Ukrainian Muslim communities and organizations, and at least 30 communities work without official registration.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Attempts to create a Ukrainian Muslim political party led to the creation of the [[Party of Muslims of Ukraine]], but its registration certificate was cancelled in November 2011 because it had not nominated candidates in elections since the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 1998|1998 parliamentary elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/117837/ Lavrynovych: Court cancels registration certificates of five Ukrainian parties], [[Kyiv Post]] (29 November 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims have also formed several charitable organizations, including the [[CAAR Foundation]], [[Al-Bushra]], and [[Life after Chornobyl]]. [[Arraid]] (The Interregional Association of Public Organizations) is another Muslim organization which has gained notable attention.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

An advance copy of first complete translation of the Quran into Ukrainian was released in [[Saudi Arabia]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advance copy of first complete translation of Quran in Ukrainian released in Saudi Arabia|url=http://www.ukrinform.ua/eng/news/advance_copy_of_first_complete_translation_of_quran_in_ukrainian_released_in_saudi_arabia|website=Ukrinform|publisher=Ukrinform|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the [[2014 Russian annexation of Crimea]] and the [[War in Donbass]], which is fought near Donetsk and Luhansk, 750,000 Muslims (including half-million Crimean Tatars) are living in territory no longer controlled by Ukraine.&lt;ref name=kpumf16&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/ukraine-politics/ukrainian-muslims-root-for-ukraine-407839.html Ukrainian Muslims root for Ukraine], [[Kyiv Post]] (11 February 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; (According to figures as stated by Said Ismagilov, the mufti of Religious Administration of Muslims of Ukraine "Ummah".&lt;ref name=kpumf16/&gt;)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4437">'''Jean Markale''' (May 23, 1928, [[Paris]] – November 23, 2008) was the pen name of '''Jean Bertrand''', a [[France|French]] writer, poet, radio show host, lecturer and high school [[French language|French]] teacher who lived in [[Brittany]]. He published numerous books about Celtic civilisation, particularly the place of women in Celtic culture, and [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] literature.

==Works==
His many works deal with subjects as varied as summations of various myths, their relationships with subjects like the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], the [[Cathar]]s and the [[Rennes le Château]] mystery, [[Atlantis]], the [[megalith]] building civilisations, Druidism and the biography of [[Saint Columba]].

*''The Celts: Uncovering the Mythic and Historic Origins of Western Culture'' ({{ISBN|0-89281-413-6}})
*''Montségur and the Mystery of the Cathars'' ({{ISBN|0-89281-090-4}})
*''Women of the Celts'' (1972)
*''The Druids: Celtic Priests of Nature'' ({{ISBN|0-89281-703-8}})
*''Cathedral of the Black Madonna: The Druids and the Mysteries of Chartres''
*''King of the Celts: Arthurian Legends and Celtic Tradition''

*''The Epics of Celtic Ireland: Ancient Tales of Mystery and Magic''
*''The Great Goddess: Reverence Of The Divine Feminine From The Paleolithic To The Present''
*''The Church of Mary Magdalene: The Sacred Feminine and the Treasure of Rennes-le-Chateau''

==Controversy==
While Markale presents himself as widely read on the subjects about which he writes, the value of his work is controversial. His 'creative' use of scholarship and his tendency to make great leaps in reasoning cause scholars following more normative and conservative methods to balk and his interest in subjects that his critics consider questionable, including various branches of the [[occultism|occult]], have gained him at least as many detractors as admirers. Another source of controversy is his use of [[Carl Jung]]'s concept of "[[collective unconscious]]" as an explanatory device, since the vast majority of psychologists outside Jungian depth psychology do not accept the concept.

His already weakened reputation was further tarnished in 1989, when he became involved in a [[plagiarism]] case after he published under his own name a serious and well-documented guide to the oddities and antiquities of [[Brittany]], the text of which had already been published, twenty years before by a different writer, through the very same publisher.

The Breton scholar [[Christian-Joseph Guyonvarc'h]] dismissed Markale as follows; "Mr Jean Bertrand, a.k.a. Jean Markale, styles himself as a professor of classical literature. He never says where he teaches; but [...] he cannot properly accentuate [[Greek language|Greek]], knows nothing of [[Latin]] [...] he doesn't know how many cases there are in [[Irish language|Irish]] declension (sometimes he says two, at other times three) [...] Jean Markale very complacently quotes his own works in his later publications and, every time an Irish text is mentioned, he refers the reader to his 'Celtic Epics' as though that book included actual translations or constituted the most basic and essential reference on the matter. All this is, at best, a joke."&lt;ref&gt;Christian-Joseph Guyonvarc'h, ''Textes Mythologiques Irlandais, Rennes, Ogam-Celticum N°11/1 &amp; 2, 1978, p. 39., Une critique détaillée de l'Ouvrage l'épopée celtique en Bretagne de Jean Markale'' (''Irish Mythological Texts, A Detailed Critique of "Celtic Epics From Britain" by Jean Markale'')&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for others, his loose scholarly presentation is balanced by "the insightful points Markale does make about various texts, clever interpretations of certain scenes and thought-provoking parallels to other traditions".&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20121012121535/http://www.mun.ca/mst/heroicage/issues/6/reviews.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14230">[[File:Jerusalem Syndrome.jpg|thumb]]
'''Jerusalem syndrome''' is a group of mental phenomena involving the presence of either religiously-themed [[Fixation (psychology)|obsessive]] ideas, [[delusion]]s or other [[psychosis]]-like experiences that are triggered by a visit to the city of [[Jerusalem]]. It is not endemic to one single religion or denomination but has affected [[Judaism|Jews]], [[Christianity|Christians]], and [[Islam|Muslims]] of many different backgrounds. It is not listed as a recognised condition in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''.

The best known, although not the most prevalent, manifestation of Jerusalem syndrome is the phenomenon whereby a person who seems previously balanced and devoid of any signs of [[psychopathology]] becomes [[psychosis|psychotic]] after arriving in Jerusalem.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} The psychosis is characterised by an intense religious theme and typically resolves to full recovery after a few weeks or after being removed from the area. The religious focus of Jerusalem syndrome distinguishes it from other phenomena, such as [[Stendhal syndrome]] in [[Florence]] or [[Paris syndrome]] for [[Japanese people|Japanese]] tourists.

In a 2000 article in the ''British Journal of Psychiatry'', Bar-El et al. claim to have identified and described a specific syndrome which emerges in tourists with no previous [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] history.&lt;ref name="Bar-El"&gt;Bar-el Y, Durst R, Katz G, Zislin J, Strauss Z, Knobler HY. (2000) Jerusalem syndrome. ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'', 176, 86-90. [http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/176/1/86 Full text]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this claim has been disputed by M. Kalian and E. Witztum.&lt;ref name="Kalian2000"&gt;Kalian M, Witztum E. (2000) "Comments on Jerusalem syndrome". ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'', 176, 492. [http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/176/5/492-a Full text]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalian1999"&gt;Kalian M, Witztum E. (1999) "The Jerusalem syndrome&amp;mdash;fantasy and reality a survey of accounts from the 19th and 20th centuries." ''Isr. J. Psychiatry Relat Sci.'', 36(4):260-71. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10687302?dopt=Abstract Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;  Kalian and Witztum stressed that nearly all of the tourists who demonstrated the described behaviours were mentally ill prior to their arrival in Jerusalem. They further noted that, of the small proportion of tourists alleged to have exhibited spontaneous [[psychosis]] after arrival in Jerusalem, Bar-El et al. had presented no evidence that the tourists had been well prior to their arrival in the city. Jerusalem syndrome is not listed or mentioned in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] nor in the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|ICD]].

Jerusalem syndrome has previously been regarded as a form of hysteria, referred to as "Jerusalem squabble poison", or "''fièvre Jérusalemienne''".&lt;ref&gt;Elon, Amos.''Jerusalem, City of Mirrors''. Little, Brown, 1989, p. 147. {{ISBN|978-0-316-23388-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first clinically described in the 1930s by Jerusalem [[psychiatrist]] Heinz Herman, one of the founders of modern psychiatric research in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbl-site.org/publications/article.aspx?articleId=374 The Jerusalem Syndrome in Biblical Archaeology].&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether or not these behaviors specifically arise from visiting Jerusalem is debated, as similar behaviors have been noted at other places of religious and historical importance such as [[Mecca]] and [[Rome]] (see [[Stendhal syndrome]]). It is known that cases of the syndrome had already been observed during the [[Middle Ages]], since it was described in the itinerary of [[Felix Fabri]] and the biography of [[Margery Kempe]]. Other cases were described in the vast literature of visitors to Jerusalem during the 19th century.

Bar-El et al. suggested that at the approach of the year 2000, large numbers of otherwise normal visitors might be affected by a combination of their presence in Jerusalem and the religious significance of the millennium, causing a massive increase in the numbers of Jerusalem syndrome admissions to hospital. Despite a slight increase in tourist hospitalisations with the rise in total tourism to Jerusalem during the year 2000, the feared epidemic of Jerusalem syndrome never materialised &lt;ref name="Bar-El" /&gt;.

==Types==
The classic Jerusalem syndrome, where a visit to Jerusalem seems to trigger an intense [[Religious delusion|religious psychosis]] that resolves quickly after or on departure, has been a subject of debate in the medical literature.&lt;ref name="Kalian2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalian1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fastovsky"&gt;Fastovsky N, Teitelbaum A, Zislin J, Katz G, Durst R. (2000) Jerusalem syndrome or paranoid schizophrenia? ''Psychiatric Services'', 51 (11), 1454. [https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ps.51.11.1454 Full text]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the discussion has centered on whether this definition of the Jerusalem syndrome is a distinct form of psychosis, or simply a re-expression of a previously existing psychotic illness that was not picked up by the medical authorities in Israel.

In response to this, Bar-El et al. classified the syndrome&lt;ref name="Bar-El"/&gt; into three major types to reflect the different types of interactions between a visit to Jerusalem and unusual or psychosis-related thought processes. However Kalian and Witztum have objected, saying that Bar-El et al. presented no evidence to justify the detailed typology and [[prognosis]] presented and that the types in fact seem to be unrelated rather than different aspects of a [[syndrome]].

===Type I===
''Jerusalem syndrome imposed on a previous psychotic illness.'' This refers to individuals already diagnosed as having a [[psychosis|psychotic]] illness before their visit to Jerusalem. They have typically gone to the city because of the influence of religious ideas, often with a goal or mission in mind that they believe needs to be completed on arrival or during their stay. For example, an affected person may believe himself to be an important historical religious figure or may be influenced by important religious ideas or concepts (such as causing the coming of the [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]] or the [[Second Coming|second coming of Christ]]).

===Type II===
''Jerusalem syndrome superimposed on and complicated by [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] ideas.'' This does not necessarily take the form of mental illness and may simply be a culturally anomalous obsession with the significance of Jerusalem, either as an individual, or as part of a small religious group with idiosyncratic spiritual beliefs.

===Type III===
''Jerusalem syndrome as a discrete form, uncompounded by previous mental illness.'' This describes the best-known type, whereby a previously mentally balanced person becomes psychotic after arriving in Jerusalem. The psychosis is characterised by an intense religious character and typically resolves to full recovery after a few weeks or after being removed from the locality. It shares some features with the diagnostic category of a "brief psychotic episode", although a distinct pattern of behaviors has been noted:{{By whom|date=January 2013}}

# Anxiety, agitation, nervousness and tension, plus other unspecified reactions.
# Declaration of the desire to split away from the group or the family and to tour Jerusalem alone. Tour guides aware of the Jerusalem syndrome and of the significance of such declarations may at this point refer the tourist to an institution for psychiatric evaluation in an attempt to preempt the subsequent stages of the syndrome. If unattended, these stages are usually unavoidable.
# A need to be clean and pure: obsession with taking baths and showers; compulsive fingernail and toenail cutting.
# Preparation, often with the aid of hotel bed-linen, of a long, ankle-length, toga-like gown, which is always white.
# The need to shout psalms or verses from the Bible, or to sing hymns or spirituals loudly. Manifestations of this type serve as a warning to hotel personnel and tourist guides, who should then attempt to have the tourist taken for professional treatment. Failing this, the two last stages will develop.
# A procession or march to one of Jerusalem's holy places, ex:The Western Wall.
# Delivery of a sermon in a holy place. The sermon is typically based on a plea to humankind to adopt a more wholesome, moral, simple way of life. Such sermons are typically ill-prepared and disjointed.
# Paranoid belief that a Jerusalem syndrome agency is after the individual, causing their symptoms of psychosis through poisoning and medicating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fastovsky|first1=Natasha|last2=Teitelbaum|first2=Alexander|last3=Zislin|first3=Josef|last4=Katz|first4=Gregory|last5=Durst|first5=Rimona|title=The Jerusalem Syndrome|journal=Psychiatric Services|date=August 2000|volume=51|issue=8|pages=1052-a–1052|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.51.8.1052-a|url=https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ps.51.8.1052-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bar-El et al. reported 42 such cases over a period of 13 years, but in no case were they able to actually confirm that the condition was temporary.

==Prevalence==
During a period of 13 years (1980–1993) for which admissions to the [[Kfar Shaul mental health center|Kfar Shaul Mental Health Centre]] in Jerusalem were analysed, it was reported&lt;ref name="Bar-El"/&gt; that 1,200 tourists with severe, Jerusalem-themed mental problems were referred to this clinic. Of these, 470 were admitted to hospital. On average, 100 such tourists have been seen annually, 40 of them requiring admission to hospital. About three and a half million tourists visit Jerusalem each year. Kalian and Witztum note that as a proportion of the total numbers of tourists visiting the city, this is not significantly different from any other city.&lt;ref name="Kalian2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tannock"&gt;Tannock C, Turner T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17600">Over the course of '''Jewish''' history, different attitudes have been held towards '''poverty and wealth'''. Unlike Christianity, in which some strands have viewed poverty as virtuous and desirable, Jews have generally viewed poverty negatively. Jacobs and Greer assert that, "[I]n general, Jewish texts have portrayed poverty as an unjustifiable burden".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=There Shall Be No Needy: Pursuing Social Justice Through Jewish Law &amp; Tradition |first1=Jill |last1=Jacobs |first2=Simon |last2=Greer |publisher=Jewish Lights Publishing |year=2010 |page=142 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=paFDnh1OvK0C&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=Jews+poverty+wealth&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DKa8TZD_MZGcsQP9j4G8BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Jews%20poverty%20wealth&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast to the consistently negative view of poverty, Kravitz and Olitzky describe a rapidly changing attitude towards acceptance of wealth as desirable as the Hebrews transitioned from being nomadic shepherds to farmers, then ultimately to city dwellers.&lt;ref name=KravitzOlitzky&gt;{{cite book |title=Mishlei: a modern commentary on Proverbs |first1=Leonard S. |last1=Kravitz |first2=Kerry M. |last2=Olitzky |publisher=URJ Books and Music |year=2002 |page=104 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PhnOxYXqlYgC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=Tanakh+poverty+wealth&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Ep-8TZeMEpG-sAODl4y_BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Kol ben Levi'', the author writes, "There are two trials before the individual: the test of wealth and the test of poverty... Both are difficult... but the test of wealth is greater than (the test of) poverty."&lt;ref&gt;Kol ben Levi&lt;/ref&gt; Cosimo Perrotta points out that servile and hired work was not scorned by the Jews of the Tanakh (Sacred Scriptures, so-called "Old Testament"). Instead, such work was protected by biblical commandments to pay workers on time and not to cheat them.

{{cquote|For there is poverty and wealth in every occupation. One's occupation does not cause poverty, nor does it bring wealth. All is determined on the basis of one's merit.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, Kiddushin 82a&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Poverty==

Ronald Eisenberg writes that, unlike the classical Christian view, "the Rabbis saw no virtue in poverty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=What the Rabbis Said: 250 Topics from the Talmud|first=Ronald L. |last=Eisenberg |publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2010 |page=142 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=18OAZvIuW3gC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=Talmud+poverty+wealth&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2KG8TdiKB4T6sAOso_zTBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Talmud%20poverty%20wealth&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lifshitz asserts that, "very rarely in Judaism is poverty associated with righteousness". Instead of being considered virtuous and desirable, poverty was viewed as "pointless suffering".&lt;ref name=Lifshitz&gt;{{cite book |first=Joseph Isaac |last=Lifshitz |title=Markets, morals &amp; religion |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2008 |page=123 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CQfKgWQRycC&amp;pg=PT123&amp;lpg=PT123&amp;dq=rabbinical+wealth+poverty&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3GsNQ9Y0Zm&amp;sig=vwYq54MD5E7ght5wS9q9gQGIl0w&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PdS8TZSqMIqosAPPrdS7BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, Cosimo Perrotta points out that poverty is not admired nor is it considered a positive value by the writers of the Tanakh. However, [[Ethics of the Fathers]] states: "Such is the way of Torah: Bread with salt you shall eat, water in small measure you shall drink, and upon the ground, you shall sleep; live a life of deprivation and toil in Torah. If so you do, "fortunate are you, and good is to you" (Psalms 128:2): Fortunate are you in this world, and it is good to you in the World To Come."

===Charity===
{{main|Tzedakah}}

[[File:Tzedakah (charity) box, Charleston, 1820, silver, National Museum of American Jewish History.JPG|thumb|Tzedakah box (''Pushke''), Charleston, 1820, silver, [[National Museum of American Jewish History]].]]
{{Judaism}}
'''''Tzedakah''''' ({{IPA-he|tsedaˈka|}} or ''''' Ṣ'daqah''''' {{IPA-he|sˤəðaːˈqaː|}} in [[Classical Hebrew]] ({{lang-he|צדקה}}; {{lang-ar|'''صدقة'''}}), is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word literally meaning "justice" or "righteousness" but commonly used to signify "[[Charity (practice)|charity]]",&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Hayim Halevy Donin; 'To Be A Jew'. Basic Books, New York; 1972, pp. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; though it is a different concept than charity because tzedakah is an obligation and charity is typically understood as a spontaneous act of goodwill and a marker of generosity. It is based on the Hebrew word (צדק, ''tzedek'') meaning "[[righteousness]]", "[[Social justice|fairness]]" or "[[justice]]", and it is related to the Hebrew word [[Tzadik]] meaning "righteous" as an adjective (or "righteous individual" as a noun in the form of a [[Noun#Substantive as a word for noun|substantive]]). In [[Judaism]], ''tzedakah'' refers to the religious obligation to do what is right and just, which Judaism emphasises are important parts of living a spiritual life. [[Maimonides]] says that, while the second highest form of ''tzedakah'' is to give donations anonymously to unknown recipients, the highest form is to give a gift, loan, or partnership that will result in the recipient supporting himself, instead of living upon others. Unlike [[philanthropy]] or charity, which is completely voluntary, ''tzedakah'' is seen as a religious obligation, which must be performed regardless of financial standing, and must even be performed by poor people. ''Tzedakah'' is considered to be one of the three main acts that can annul a less than favorable heavenly decree.

===Obligation to avoid poverty===

Lifshitz asserts that, because poverty is something to be avoided, Jews are exhorted to earn their living through gainful employment. Jewish law calls upon Jews to do everything in their power to avoid becoming a burden on others. They are to be responsible for their own welfare and not to rely on the community to provide for them. Although the wealthy are called upon to be charitable to the poor, Lifshitz insists that this does not absolve the poor from their responsibility to earn a living. He argues that the Law does not mandate redistribution of wealth and that, in Judaism, the property of the wealthy is theirs to do with entirely as they please.&lt;ref name=Lifshitz /&gt;

===Protection of the poor===

Although poverty is neither virtuous nor desirable, Judaic Law commands that the poor are to be respected and protected. According to Jacobs and Greer, "The overarching Jewish attitude toward the poor can be best summed up in a single word: achikha (your brother). Jews are enjoined by the Torah to resist any temptation to view the poor as somehow different from themselves.&lt;Lucy kinyuaref&gt;{{cite book |title=There Shall Be No Needy: Pursuing Social Justice Through Jewish Law &amp; Tradition |first1=Jill |last1=Jacobs |first2=Simon |last2=Greer |publisher=Jewish Lights Publishing |year=2010 |page=12 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=paFDnh1OvK0C&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Jewish+attitudes+poverty&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xeC8TabECJCcsQPMyMjHBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Jewish%20attitudes%20poverty&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tanakh sets forth numerous protections of the poor. As an example of such protections, Perotta points out that the poor were protected from being exploited when in debt. Perrotta asserts that the goal of these commandments was "not only to protect the poor, but also to prevent the excessive accumulation of wealth in a few hands". In essence, the poor man is "protected by God".&lt;ref name=Perrotta44&gt;{{cite book|title=Consumption as an Investment: The fear of goods from Hesiod to Adam Smith|first=Cosimo|last=Perrotta |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2004 |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ogMXO-ZxbEC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Christian+attitudes+wealth+poverty&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kgG2Tc7DEJC0sAOfmIigDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20attitudes%20wealth%20poverty&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kravitz and Olitzky cite the [[Jubilee (biblical)|Jubilee (yoveil)]] and the [[Shmita|sh'mitah]] as examples of commandments in the Torah designed to protect the poor.&lt;ref name=KravitzOlitzky /&gt;

==Wealth==

According to Joseph Lifshitz, "Jewish tradition insists that man can, and should, have a powerful impact on the material world."&lt;ref name=KravitzOlitzky /&gt; Perrotta asserts that material wealth is highly valued in the Tanakh; the Hebrews seek it and God promises to bless them with it if they will follow his commandments.&lt;ref name=Perrotta44 /&gt; Joseph Francis Kelly writes that biblical writers portray God as enabling men such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Solomon to achieve wealth and that this wealth was considered a clear sign of divine favor. Kelly notes that the Old Testament also insisted the rich aid the poor. Prophets such as Amos castigated the rich for oppressing the poor and crushing the needy. In summary, Kelly writes that, "the Old Testament saw wealth as something good, but warned the wealthy not to use their position to harm those with less. The rich had an obligation to alleviate the sufferings of the poor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The World of the early Christians |first=Joseph Francis |last=Kelly|publisher=Liturgical Press |year=1997 |page=166 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Pw-n3puQwsC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=%22Old+Testament%22+attitudes+poverty+wealth&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hwi2Tf_TOZS8sAPu9YiQDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Old%20Testament%22%20attitudes%20poverty%20wealth&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of attitudes towards wealth and poverty in the Tanakh==

In contrast to the consistently negative view of poverty, Kravitz and Olitzky describe a rapidly changing attitude towards acceptance of wealth as desirable as the Hebrews transitioned from being nomadic shepherds to farmers and ultimately to city dwellers. They assert that the three divisions in the Tanakh starting with Abraham can be viewed as representing three chronological periods in Jewish history: the wilderness, the land and the city. The Hebrews are depicted in the Tanakh first as nomadic shepherds, then as farmers and finally as urban dwellers.

Kravitz and Olitzky assert that, during the time of the Patriarchs through the years in the wilderness, wealth seemed to have been "held in common with no real distinctions between the rich and the poor". However, they note that the possibility for individual wealth arose as the Hebrews transitioned from a nomadic pastoral society to a more agrarian economy. They cite early prophets such as [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]], who viewed themselves as the heirs of the pastoral tradition and spoke out against those who oppressed the poor. The transition of Jewish society to an urban economy in the Hellenistic period intensified the societal issues surrounding poverty and wealth. Kravitz and Olitzky characterize rabbinic Judaism as "the Judaism of the city" rather than that of the shepherd or the farmer. As such, rabbinical Judaism found it necessary to address the needs of business and commerce including the need to raise money and protect capital investments. As an example of such accommodations, Kravitz and Olitzky cite [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]]'s invention of [[p'rozbol]], a legal fiction to nullify the requirements of the sh'mitah. According to Joseph Lifshitz, "Jewish tradition insists that man can, and should, have a powerful impact on the material world."&lt;ref name=KravitzOlitzky /&gt;

==Individual charity and public welfare==

Aaron Levine comments that, although the concept of public welfare is an integral part of the modern state, its historical origins are relatively recent, starting in the late nineteenth century. According to Levine, the key concept of the welfare state is that voluntarism alone is not sufficient address the needs of the poor and the disadvantaged. Thus, government steps in to complement private efforts by establishing programs to guarantee a minimum standard of living and to protect individuals against certain adverse events. Levine points out that, in Judaism, these principles can be traced back to Talmudic times (300 B.C.E. to 500 C.E.) and are embodied in Jewish Law (Halakah). Levine characterizes the Judaic approach to social welfare as a "dual anti-poverty system, consisting of private and public components".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Public policy and social issues: Jewish sources and perspective |first=Marshall J. |last=Breger |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2003 |page=133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e0w_efB4TGYC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=Jews+welfare+%22thousands+of+years%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nXLNTbiRG4-csQPFrum7Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergence of organized public charities===

Lifshitz writes that "the concept of welfare in Jewish law rests primarily on various socio-agricultural commandments of the Torah". He cites commandments that mandate the reservation of part of the harvest for the poor. However, he notes that, although the Torah explicitly commands charity to the poor, there are very few specific commandments that promulgate charity outside of the provisions that are tied to agriculture.&lt;ref name=Lifshitz /&gt;
Lifshitz surmises that the general commandment mandating charity combined with the agriculture-related provisions may have been adequate to provide for the poor in an agrarian economy but, as Jewish society became increasingly urban in a Hellenistic society, the poor lost the lifeline formerly provided by the commandments that were tied to an agricultural society. Since the urban poor no longer had access to the fields, the commandments that mandated that a portion of the harvest to be set aside for them were no longer suitable for providing for their needs. This required the rabbis to expand the doctrine of charity to provide not only food but also money and other means of subsistence. One example of this was the institution of the custom of donating one tenth of all profits to charity, along the model of the agricultural tithes for the poor.&lt;ref name=Lifshitz /&gt;

According to Lifshitz, the shift from an agrarian society to an urban one enabled a transformation of charity from the independent actions of individuals to the concerted efforts of groups working in an organized fashion. Jewish communal life was modeled after the Hellenistic ''polis'' and among the public functionaries were collectors and disbursers of communal charity (''gabbaim''). Lifshitz notes that, even though the institutionalization of communal charity competed with "the personal and individual character of charity", this existence of communal charity did not relieve the individual from his personal obligation to support the needy. Thus, although the community collected welfare taxes from its members, this represented a minimum level of charitable giving and was not intended to supplant or displace personal charitable donations to friends or relatives.&lt;ref name=Lifshitz /&gt;

==Philanthropy==
[[File:Julius Rosenwald 02.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Julius Rosenwald]]
[[Philanthropy]] is an important part of Jewish culture, and many prominent Jews have made large donations to charitable causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jews and money |first=Abraham |last=Foxman|pages=90–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Derek Penslar]] speculates that the philanthropic tradition in the Jewish community originated in the early nineteenth century because the Jewish middle class were embarrassed by poor Jews, and were worried that the Jewish peddlers and vagrants would endanger the recent gains in status - so Jewish activists prohibited begging and supported aid for the poor.

'''John Andreas Widtsoe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɪ|t|s|oʊ}}; 31 January 1872 – 29 November 1952) was a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) from 1921 until his death. Widtsoe was also a noted author, scientist, and academic.

==Early life==
Widtsoe was born on the island of [[Frøya, Sør-Trøndelag|Frøya]] in [[Sør-Trøndelag]], [[Norway]]. At birth his hand was attached to the side of his head, but he had an operation to correct this problem.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Cummins, [http://www.lds.org/friend/1990/05/john-a-widtsoe-master-teacher “John A. Widtsoe—Master Teacher,”] ''[[The Friend (LDS magazine)|Friend]]'', May 1990, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; When Widtsoe was two, his family moved to the Norwegian mainland city of [[Namsos]]. His father, also named John, died in February 1878. This left his mother, Anna, as a widow with two young sons to take care of: Widtsoe, who was then five, and his younger brother [[Osborne Widtsoe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan K. Parrish|Parrish, Alan K.]] ''John A. Widtsoe: A Biography.'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: [[Deseret Book]], 2003) p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to [[Trondheim]], where they were introduced to the LDS Church by a shoemaker.&lt;ref&gt;Parrish. ''Widtsoe''. pp. 20–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883, Widtsoe immigrated to the United States with his mother and brother. They arrived in [[Utah Territory]] in mid-November.&lt;ref&gt;Parrish. ''Widtsoe''. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Widtsoe was baptized a member of the LDS Church the following April.&lt;ref&gt;Parrish. ''Widtsoe''. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Widtsoe graduated from [[Brigham Young College]] in [[Logan, Utah]]. He then attended [[Harvard University]], graduating with honors in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. Homer Durham|Durham, G. Homer]]. "Foreword" to Widtsoe, John A. ''The Message of the Doctrine and Covenants''. (Salt Lake City, Utah: [[Bookcraft]], 1969) p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, Widtsoe was ordained to the office of [[Seventy (LDS Church)|seventy]] and [[Setting apart|set apart]] to do missionary work in connection with his studies in [[Europe]]. He entered the [[University of Göttingen]], [[Germany]], and graduated with the degrees of A.M. and [[Ph.D.]] in 1899. For part of his time in Europe, Widtsoe lived in Switzerland. The police wanted proof that he and his wife were married, and since they had neglected to bring their American wedding certificate with them, they were married a second time.&lt;ref&gt;Widtsoe, John A. "In A Sunlight Land".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
[[File:John A. Widtsoe.jpg|left|100px|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Widtsoe ca. 1920&lt;/center&gt;]]
In August 1900, Widtsoe became the director of the Agricultural Experiment Station at [[Utah State Agricultural College]].&lt;ref&gt;Parrish. ''Widtsoe''. p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; While in this position, he founded ''The Deseret Farmer'' with Lewis A. Merrill and J. Edward Taylor. Their goal was to have it be a popular magazine that would be read and implemented by farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Parrish. ''Widtsoe''.  p. 547.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, Widtsoe was dismissed from the agricultural college as a result of political debates about its future and feelings of [[William Jasper Kerr]], the university's president, that Widtsoe was insufficiently supporting him.&lt;ref&gt;Parrish. ''Widtsoe''. p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a short time, Widtsoe was a professor of agriculture at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU), and is arguably the founding father of BYU's college of biology and agriculture. (Previously on the BYU campus, the John A. Widtsoe Building was the home of the College of Biology and Agriculture. A new building, the Life Sciences Building, took its place in 2014). Soon, however, he returned to Logan and succeeded Kerr as president of Utah State Agricultural College; he served in this position from 1907 to 1916. He also served as the president of the [[University of Utah]] from 1916 until his call as a member of the LDS Church's Quorum of the Twelve in 1921. Widtsoe was the fifth [[Commissioner of Church Education]] from 1921 to 1924 and was the seventh commissioner from 1934 to 1936.

During his time as an [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]], Widtsoe taught a religion class at the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;Parrish. ''Widtsoe''. p. 535–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal government work==
For two years in the 1920s, Widtsoe lived in [[Washington, D.C.]], where he supervised the reorganization of the [[United States Bureau of Reclamation|Federal Bureau of Reclamation]].&lt;ref name = Garr&gt;Parrish, Alan K. "John A. Widtsoe" in [[Arnold K. Garr|Garr, Arnold K]], [[Donald Q. Cannon]] and [[Richard O. Cowan]], ed. ''Encyclopedia of Latter-day Saint History'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: [[Deseret Book]], 2000) p. 1343.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles==
Widtsoe was closely associated with the ''[[Improvement Era]]'' even before he became an apostle. He was associate editor of the magazine from 1935 until 1952.&lt;ref name = Garr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parrish. ''Widtsoe'', p. 548.&lt;/ref&gt;  As editor of the ''Improvement Era'', Widtsoe "directed its growth from a magazine primarily for the youth to the voice of the whole Church".&lt;ref name = Garr/&gt; One of Widtsoe's employees while at the magazine was [[Hugh Nibley]], who Widtsoe convinced to become a professor at BYU.&lt;ref&gt;[[Boyd Petersen|Peterson, Boyd]]. ''Hugh Nibley: A Consecrated Life''. (Salt Lake City, Utah: Greg Kofford Books, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Widtsoe was also a member of the church's Genealogy Committee, being one of the main people behind the implementation of the Temple Index Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;[[James B. Allen (historian)|Allen, James B.]], Jessie L. Embry and Kahlile B. Mehr. ''Hearts Turned to the Fathers: A History of the Genealogical Society of Utah, 1894-1994'' (Provo, Utah: [[BYU Studies]], 1995) p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Missions to Europe===
In 1923, Widtsoe accompanied fellow apostle, [[Reed Smoot]], on a journey to [[Great Britain]] and the Scandinavian countries, during which they secured recognition and opened the way for missionaries of the church to return to these lands.&lt;ref name = Garr/&gt;

From 1926 until 1932, Widtsoe served as [[mission president|president]] of the European [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]]. While in this office, he convinced the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] to call a separate president of the British Mission, so that the president of the European Mission could focus on supervising the missions in continental Europe. While president of the European Mission, Widtsoe dedicated [[Czechoslovakia]] for the preaching of the gospel, and worked closely with [[Arthur Gaeth]] in starting the mission there.

==Marriage and writings==
Widtsoe married Leah Dunford, a daughter of [[Susa Young Gates]], who was a daughter of LDS Church [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Brigham Young]]. Widtsoe worked closely with his wife and mother-in-law to write a biography about Young. Widtsoe also edited a book containing significant teachings of Young. Widtsoe was also the lead compiler of ''Gospel Doctrine'', a collection of sermons and teachings of LDS Church president [[Joseph F. Smith]].

Widtsoe and his wife authored ''The Word of Wisdom: A Modern Interpretation'', a book which advocates the incorporation of healthy eating habits into the [[Word of Wisdom]].

Widtsoe wrote ''A Rational Theology as Taught by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'', which has been cited by later LDS authors such as [[J. Reuben Clark]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, J. Reuben. ''Behold the Lamb of God''. (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book Company, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote ''[[Evidences and Reconciliations]]'', which was a compilation of his ''Improvement Era'' writings, answering common questions on matters of faith.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Richard L. Evans|Evans, Richard L.]] "Introduction" to Widtsoe, John A. (arranged by [[G. Homer Durham]]) ''[[Evidences and Reconciliations]]''. (Salt Lake City&lt; utah: [[Bookcraft]], 1960).&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Widtsoe acknowledges that there are multiple interpretations that Latter-day Saints can hold on certain issues. One example is his explanation of the time involved in the creation of the earth: he indicated that faithful Latter-day Saints could hold the "six-day", "six-thousand-years", or the "undefined-period" interpretations of the creation. Although Widtsoe focused on explaining the rationale for the "undefined-period" interpretation, he did not belittle the other two or state that they were unorthodox.

In 1939, Widtsoe published ''Priesthood and Church Welfare'' and ''Priesthood and Church Government''. His work, ''The Message of the Doctrine and Covenants'', was published after his death, after having been edited by his son-in-law, [[G. Homer Durham]]. Widtsoe wrote ''Seven Claims of the Book of Mormon: A Collection of Evidences'' with Franklin S. Harris, Jr.

Widtsoe wrote a biography of [[Joseph Smith]] entitled ''Joseph Smith: Seeker After Truth Prophet of God''. It was published in 1951, and later reprinted by [[Bookcraft]] in 1957. Widtsoe also wrote ''Joseph Smith as Scientist: A Contribution to Mormon Philosophy'', published by the [[Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association]] in 1908. In 1944, his essay, "The Divine Mission of Joseph Smith", was included in ''Handbook of the Restoration'' published by Zion's Printing and Publishing Company in [[Independence, Missouri]].

Non-religious books by Widtsoe include ''Dry-Farming: A System of Agriculture for Countries Under a Low Rainfall'' (New York: MacMillan, 1920) and ''Dodge's Geography of Utah''.

Widtsoe wrote two autobiographies. The first, ''In the Gospel Net'', largely focused on his mother's conversion to the LDS Church. The second, ''In a Sunlit Land'', told the story of his later life, and also included explanations of his educational philosophy.

==Hymns==
Widtsoe wrote the hymn "How Long, O Lord Most Holy and True", which appears as hymn number 126 in the current [[Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1985 book)|LDS hymnal]].

==Death==
[[Image:JohnAWidtsoeGrave.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Grave marker of John A. Widtsoe.]]

Widtsoe died in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], of [[uremia]]; he also had [[prostate]] cancer for a number of years before his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.archives.utah.gov/data/81448/4093491/4093491_0119.jpg State of Utah Death Certificate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818100006/http://images.archives.utah.gov/data/81448/4093491/4093491_0119.jpg |date=2011-08-18 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at [[Salt Lake City Cemetery]].

[[Adam S. Bennion]] was called to fill the vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve following Widtsoe's death.

'''Julia Drusilla''' ([[Classical Latin]]: &lt;small&gt;IVLIA•DRVSILLA&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|E. Groag, A. Stein, L. Petersen - e.a.}} (edd.), ''Prosopographia Imperii Romani saeculi I, II et III'' ('''PIR'''), Berlin, 1933 - I 664&lt;/ref&gt;) (16 September 16 AD &amp;ndash; 10 June 38 AD) was a member of the Roman imperial family, the second daughter and fifth child of [[Germanicus]] and [[Agrippina the Elder]] to survive infancy. She had two sisters, [[Julia Livilla]] and the Empress [[Agrippina the Younger]], and three brothers, Emperor [[Caligula]], [[Nero Julius Caesar]], and [[Drusus Caesar|Drusus]]. She was a great-granddaughter of the Emperor [[Augustus]], grand-niece of the Emperor [[Tiberius]], niece of the Emperor [[Claudius]], and aunt of the Emperor [[Nero]].

==Biography==
Drusilla was born in Abitarvium, modern day [[Koblenz]], [[Germany]]. After the death of her father, [[Germanicus]], she and her siblings were brought back to Rome by their mother and raised with the help of their paternal grandmother, [[Antonia Minor]]. In 33 CE, Drusilla was married to [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (husband of Drusilla)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]], a friend of the Emperor [[Tiberius]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of the Caesars'', ''Life of Caligula'', 21.&lt;/ref&gt; After Caligula became emperor in 37 CE, however, he ordered their divorce and married his sister to his friend, [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]].&lt;ref name="Cassius Dio, 59.11.1"&gt;Cassius Dio, 59.11.1&lt;/ref&gt; During an illness in 37 CE, Caligula changed his will to name Drusilla his heir,&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of the Caesars'', ''Life of Caligula'', 24.&lt;/ref&gt; making her the first woman to be named heir in a Roman imperial will. This was probably an attempt to continue the Julian line through any children she might have, leaving her husband to rule in the meantime.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Wood, Diva Drusilla Panthea and the Sisters of Caligula, American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 99, No. 3 (July 1995), pp.459&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula recovered however, and in 38 CE, at the age of about twenty-two, Drusilla died.&lt;ref name="Cassius Dio, 59.11.1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of the Caesars'', ''Life of Caligula'', 24.2&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother went on to deify her, consecrating her with the title "Panthea" (all-goddess) and mourning at her public funeral as though he were a widower.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of the Caesars'', ''Life of Caligula'', 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, 59.11.1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==
Reportedly, Drusilla was her brother's favorite. There also are rumors that they were lovers. If true, that role probably gained her great influence over Caligula. Although the activities between the brother and sister might have been seen as [[incest]]uous by their contemporaries, it is not certain whether they were sexual partners. Drusilla earned a rather poor reputation because of the close bond she shared with Caligula and even was likened to a [[prostitute]] by later scholars, in attempts to discredit Caligula.&lt;ref name="diva"&gt;Susan Wood, ''Diva Drusilla Panthea and the Sisters of Caligula'', American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 99, No. 3 (July , 1995), p. 457-482&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians suggest that Caligula was motivated by more than mere [[lust]] or [[love]] in pursuing intimate relationships with his sisters, thinking instead, that he may have decided deliberately to pattern the Roman lineage after the [[Hellenistic]] [[monarch]]s of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] where marriages between jointly ruling brothers and sisters had become [[tradition]] rather than [[sex scandal]]s. This also has been used to explain why his [[despotism]] apparently was more evident to his contemporaries than those of Augustus and Tiberius.

The source of many of the rumors surrounding Caligula and Drusilla may be derived from formal Roman dining habits.&lt;ref name="diva"/&gt; It was customary in [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] households for the host and hostess of a dinner (or in other words, the husband and the wife in charge of the household) to hold the positions of honor at banquets in their residence. In the case of a young bachelor being the head of the household, the female position of honor traditionally was to be held by his sisters, in rotation. In Caligula's case, [[Agrippina the Younger]], Drusilla, and [[Julia Livilla]] would have taken turns sitting in the place of honor. Apparently, Caligula broke with this tradition and reserved the place of honor exclusively for Drusilla.

==Death and aftermath==
Drusilla died on 10 June 38 AD, probably of an illness that was rampant in Rome at the time. Caligula was said never to have left her side throughout her illness and, after she had died, he would not let anyone take away her body.

Caligula was badly affected by the loss. He buried his sister with the honors of an [[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]] and acted as a grieving [[widower]]. He had the [[Roman Senate]] declare her a [[Goddess]], as "[[Apotheosis#Ancient Rome|Diva]] Drusilla", deifying her as a representation of the Roman goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] or the Greek goddess [[Aphrodite]]. Drusilla was consecrated as ''Panthea'', most likely on the anniversary of the birthday of [[Augustus]].&lt;ref name="diva"/&gt;

A year later, Caligula named his only known daughter, [[Julia Drusilla (daughter of Caligula)|Julia Drusilla]], after his dead sister. Meanwhile, the widowed husband of Drusilla, [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], reportedly became a lover to her sisters, [[Julia Livilla]] and [[Agrippina the Younger]], in an apparent attempt to gain their support that he would succeed Caligula. This political conspiracy was discovered during that autumn by Caligula while in [[Germania Superior]]. Lepidus was [[Execution (legal)|executed]] swiftly and Livilla and Agrippina were exiled to the [[Pontine Islands]].

==Cultural references==
*In the [[Robert Graves]] novel, ''[[Claudius (novel)|I, Claudius]]'', the narrator of the story states that he believes that Drusilla was killed by Caligula, although he admits that he does not have firm evidence of this.
*This theme was embellished considerably in the 1976 BBC [[I, Claudius (TV series)|television adaptation]] of ''I, Claudius'', where Drusilla was played by [[Beth Morris]]. A pregnant Drusilla was subjected to a brutal [[Caesarean section]] by an insane Caligula, who then swallowed the child as [[Zeus]] did his children. Although scenes depicting that scenario were cut from the production before broadcast in the [[United States]], they were restored for the [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] releases.
*[[Teresa Ann Savoy]] played Drusilla in the 1979 [[motion picture]] ''[[Caligula (film)|Caligula]]'', which showed a version of Drusilla dying from a fever, followed by a scene of [[Caligula]] licking her corpse in mourning, and then having [[sexual intercourse]] with Drusilla one last time in an act of [[necrophilia]]. The last scene was deleted from all the released versions of the film.

[[Image:Kagura villain.jpg|thumb|Mask from contemporary ''kagura'' performance]]
'''''Kagura''''' (神楽, かぐら, "god-entertainment") is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word referring to a specific type of [[Shinto]] theatrical dance—with roots arguably predating those of [[Noh]]. Once strictly a ceremonial art derived from ''kami'gakari'' (神懸, かみがかり, "oracular divinaification"), Kagura has evolved in many directions over the span of more than a millennium. Today it is very much a living tradition, with rituals tied to the rhythms of the agricultural calendar, as well as vibrant [[Kabuki]]-esque theatre, thriving primarily in parts of [[Shimane prefecture]], and urban centers such as [[Hiroshima]].&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, David. (2007). Invitation to Kagura: Hidden Gem of the Traditional Japanese Performing Arts. Morrisville: Lulu Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The epics ''[[Kojiki]]'' and ''[[Nihonshoki]]'' describe a folklore origin for the dances. In these texts, there is a famous legendary tale about the sun goddess [[Amaterasu]], who retreated into a cave, bringing darkness and cold to the world. [[Ame-no-Uzume]], ''kami''/goddess of the dawn and of revelry, led the other gods in a wild dance, and persuaded Amaterasu to emerge to see what the ruckus was all about.&lt;ref&gt;''Nihongi: Chronicles of Japan from the Earliest Times to A.D. 697'', translated from the original Chinese and Japanese by [[William George Aston]]. Book I, part 1, page 44f. Tuttle Publishing. Tra edition (July 2005). First edition published 1972. {{ISBN|978-0-8048-3674-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kagura'' is one of a number of rituals and arts said to derive from this event.

Originally called ''kamukura'' or ''kamikura'' (神座), ''kagura'' began as sacred dances performed at the Imperial court by shrine maidens (''[[miko]]'') who were supposedly descendants of Ame-no-Uzume. Over time, however, these ''mikagura'' (御神楽), performed within the sacred and private precincts of the Imperial courts, inspired popular ritual dances, called ''satokagura'' (里神楽), which, being popular forms, practiced in villages all around the country, were adapted into various other folk traditions and developed into a number of different forms. Among these are ''miko kagura'', ''shishi kagura'', and [[Ise Shrine|Ise]]-style and [[Izumo Shrine|Izumo]]-style ''kagura'' dances. Many more variations have developed over the centuries, including some which are fairly new, and most of which have become highly secularized folk traditions.

''Kagura'', in particular those forms that involve storytelling or reenactment of fables, is also one of the primary influences on the [[Noh]] theatre.

==Imperial Kagura==
The formal ritual dances (''mikagura'') were performed in a number of sacred places and on a number of special occasions. At the [[Three Palace Sanctuaries|Imperial Sanctuary]], where the [[Yata no kagami|Sacred Mirror]] was kept, they were performed as part of ''[[gagaku]]'' court music. ''Mikagura'' were also performed at the Imperial harvest festival and at major shrines such as Ise, [[Kamo Shrines|Kamo]], and [[Iwashimizu Shrine|Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū]]. Since around the year 1000, these events have taken place every year.

According to the ritual department of the [[Imperial Household Agency]], ''kagura'' still take place every December in the Imperial Sanctuary and at the Imperial harvest festival ceremonies.

==Folk Kagura==
''Satokagura'', or "normal kagura", is a wide umbrella term containing a great diversity of folk dances derived from ''mikagura'', and incorporated with other folk traditions. For the sake of brevity&lt;!--and my lack of sources...--&gt;, a selection of traditions from the [[Kantō region]] will be used as examples.

*'''Miko kagura''' – dances performed by shrine maidens (''[[miko]]'') originally derived from ritual dances in which the ''miko'' channeled the ''kami'', speaking, singing, and dancing as the god. Though these originally had a very loose form, akin to similar god-possession dances and rituals in other world cultures, they have developed, like many other Japanese arts, into highly regular set forms. Today, they are performed largely in worship to ''kami'' at [[Shinto shrine]]s, or as part of a ritual [[martial arts]] demonstration at [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temples]]. These dances are often performed with ritual props, such as bells, bamboo canes, sprigs of [[sakaki]], or [[Shide (shinto)|paper streamers]].
*'''Izumo-ryū kagura''' – Dances based on those performed at [[Izumo Shrine]] serve a number of purposes, including [[ritual purification]], celebration of auspicious days, and the reenactment of folktales. Originally quite popular in the [[Chūgoku region]], near [[Izumo, Shimane|Izumo]], these dances have spread across the country, and have developed over the centuries, becoming more secular folk entertainment and less formal religious ritual.

[[Image:Susanoo-Orochi.jpg|thumb|[[Susanoo]] and [[Orochi]] in Izumo-ryū kagura]]
*'''Ise-ryū kagura''' – A form of dances derived from those performed alongside ''[[yudate]]'' (boiling water) rituals at the outer shrines of [[Ise Shrine]]. Largely associated with ''[[Buddha's Birthday|Hanamatsuri]]'' (April 8), the ''miko'' or other group leaders immerse certain objects in boiling water as part of a purification ritual. As with other forms of ''kagura'', this has become secularized and popularized as it transformed into a folk practice.
*'''Shishi kagura''' – A form of [[lion dance]], in which a group of dancers take on the role of the ''shishi'' lion and parade around the town. The lion mask and costume is seen as, in some ways, embodying the spirit of the lion, and this is a form of folk worship and ritual, as other forms of lion dances are in Japan and elsewhere...

[[Image:Nikko Toshogu Yomeimon Kagura M4482.jpg|thumb|''Kagura'' hall (left) at [[Nikkō Tōshōgū]], a Shinto shrine associated with the founder of the Tokugawa Shogunate]]
*'''Daikagura''' – A form of dance deriving from rituals performed by traveling priests from [[Atsuta Shrine|Atsuta]] and Ise Shrines, who would travel to villages, crossroads, and other locations to help the locals by driving away evil spirits. Acrobatic feats and lion dances played a major role in these rituals.

Around the time of the beginning of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] (1603-1868), performances derived from this emerged in [[Edo]] as a major form of entertainment. In connection with the celebrations surrounding the beginning of the shogunate, lion dances, acrobatics, juggling, and a great variety of other entertainments were performed on stages across the city, all nominally under the auspices of "''daikagura''". Over the course of the period, these came to be more closely associated with ''rakugo'' storytelling and other forms of populair entertainment, and still today, ''daikagura'' continues to be performed and include many elements of street entertainment.

The '''Karkadann''' (from ''Kargadan'', [[Persian language|Persian]]: كرگدن "Lord of the Desert"{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}) is a [[mythical creature]] said to have lived on the grassy plains of [[India]] and [[Iran|Persia]].

The word ''kargadan'' also means [[rhinoceros]] in Persian and Arabic.

Depictions of ''karkadann'' are found also in [[North Indian]] art.&lt;ref name=suhr&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suhr|first=Elmer G.|title=An Interpretation of the Unicorn|journal=[[Folklore Society|Folklore]]|year=1964|volume=75|issue=2|pages=91–109|doi=10.1080/0015587x.1964.9716952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the unicorn, it can be subdued by virgins and acts ferociously toward other animals.&lt;ref name=suhr/&gt; Originally based on the [[Indian Rhinoceros]] (one of the meanings of the word) and first described in the 10th/11th century, it evolved in the works of later writers to a mythical animal "with a shadowy rhinocerine ancestor"&lt;ref name=lavers/&gt; endowed with strange qualities, such as a [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]] endowed with medicinal qualities.

==Evolution of Descriptions==

An early description of the karkadann comes from the 10/11th century Persian scholar [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī]] (Al-Biruni, 973–1048). He describes an animal which has "the build of a buffalo...a black, scaly skin; a dewlap hanging down under the skin. It has three yellow hooves on each foot...The tail is not long. The eyes lie low, farther down the cheek than is the case with all other animals. On the top of the nose there is a single horn which is bent upwards." A fragment of Al-Biruni preserved in the work of another author adds a few more characteristics: "the horn is conical, bent back towards the head, and longer than a span...the animal's ears protrude on both sides like those of a donkey, and...its upper lip forms into a finger-shape, like the protrusion on the end of an elephant's trunk." These two descriptions leave no doubt that the Indian Rhinoceros is the basis for the animal.&lt;ref name=lavers/&gt; But the future confusion between the rhinoceros and the [[unicorn]] was already in the making since the Persian language uses the same word, ''karkadann'', for the mythological animal as it does for the rhinoceros, and this confusion is evident also in the illustrations of the creature.&lt;ref name=rice&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rice|first=D.S.|title=Rev. of Ettinghausen, ''The Unicorn''|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|year=1955|volume=17|issue=1|pages=172–74|doi=10.1017/s0041977x00106470 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Al-Biruni, Persian scholars took his description and formed ever more fanciful versions of the beast, aided by the absence of first-hand knowledge and the difficulty of reading and interpreting old Arabic script. A decisive shift in description concerned the horn: where Al-Biruni had stuck to the short, curved horn, later writers made it a long, straight horn, which was shifted in artists' representations from the animal's nose to its brow.&lt;ref name=lavers&gt;{{cite book|last=Lavers|first=Chris|title=The Natural History of Unicorns|year=2010|publisher=RandomHouse|isbn=978-0-06-087415-5|pages=107–109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzMtZjql37oC&amp;pg=PA108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Persian physician [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]] (Al-Qazwini, d. 1283) is one of the writers who at the end of the thirteenth century links the karkadann's horn with poison,&lt;ref name=lavers/&gt; in his ''[[ʿAjā'ib al-makhlūqāt wa gharā'ib al-mawjūdāt]]''. He lists a few beneficial effects: holding the horn opens up the bowels to relieve constipation, and it can cure [[epilepsy]] and lameness.&lt;ref name=hees&gt;{{cite book|last=Hees|first=Syrinx von|title=Enzyklopädie als Spiegel des Weltbildes|year=2002|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-04511-7|pages=205–208|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q8ZztmBZzvAC&amp;pg=PA207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later authors have the horn perspire when poison is present, suggesting the horn is an [[antidote]] and connecting it to [[Unicorn#Alicorn|alicorn]], though this connection is not made by all writers.&lt;ref name=lavers/&gt;

In the 14th century, [[Ibn Battuta]], in his travelogue, calls the rhinoceros he saw in [[India]] a karkadann, and describes it as a ferocious beast, driving away from [[territory (animal)|its territory]] animals as big as the elephant;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ettinghausen|first=Richard|title=The Unicorn|year=1950|publisher=Freer Gallery of Art.

The karkadann is referred to by Elmer Suhr as the "Persian version of the unicorn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suhr|first=Elmer G.|title=An Interpretation of the Medusa|journal=[[Folklore Society|Folklore]]|year=1965|volume=76|issue=2|pages=90–103|doi=10.1080/0015587x.1965.9716995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name appears also in medieval European [[Bestiary|bestiaries]], such as those from Escorial and Paris, where the name ''karkadann'' appears in the captions of unicorn illustrations.&lt;ref name=contadini/&gt;

==Horn==
Al-Qazwini, one of the earliest authors to claim the horn is an antidote to poison, also notes that it is used in the manufacturing of knife handles. According to Chris Lavers, ''The Natural History of Unicorns'', [[khutu]], a somewhat enigmatic material possibly consisting of ivory or bone, had been ascribed [[wikt:alexipharmic|alexipharmic]] properties. Both of these "enigmatic horns," Lavers argues, were used in making cutlery, and so became associated; this is how in the 13th century Al-Qazwini could consider karkadann horn as an antidote, and this is how the karkadann became associated with the unicorn.&lt;ref name=lavers/&gt;

==Name==
The name ''karkadann'' is a variation of the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''kargadan'', or [[Sanskrit]] ''kartajan'', which is said to mean "lord of the desert".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lunds universitet.

It has been conjectured that the mythical karkadann may have an origin in an account from the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ettinghausen|first=Richard|title=Late Classical and Medieval Studies in Honor of Albert Mathias Friend Jr.,|year=1955|publisher=Princeton UP|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial portion of Persian ''kargadan'' resembles the Sanskrit word "khaRga" for rhinoceros also meaning sword, where "R" represents a retroflex flap sound. The rhinoceros is "sword horned".

==The karkadann in modern scholarship and culture==

===Scholarship on the karkadann===
Much of the available material on the karkadann was collected by [[Richard Ettinghausen]] in his 1950 publication ''The Unicorn'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vajda|first=Georges|title=Deux commentaires karaïtes sur l'ecclésiaste|year=1971|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-02658-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMh_bnLul2gC&amp;pg=PA86|page=86 note 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book highly praised and often referred to as a standard reference on the unicorn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarton|first=George|author2=Frances Siegel|title=Seventy-Seventh Critical Bibliography of the History and Philosophy of Science and of the History of Civilization (To March 1951)|journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]|year=1951|volume=42|issue=4|pages=309–95|doi=10.1086/349357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Souchal|first=Geneviève|title=Rev. of Freeman, ''The Unicorn Tapestries''|journal=[[The Art Bulletin]]|year=1980|volume=62|issue=2|pages=313–16|doi=10.2307/3050007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable appearances and references===
The karkadann is the topic of a long poem by Tawfiq Sayigh (d. 1971), "A Few Questions I Pose to the Unicorn," which was hailed by [[Jabra Ibrahim Jabra]] as "the strangest and most remarkable poem in the Arabic language."&lt;ref name=stetkevych&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stetkevych|first=Jaroslav|title=In Search of the Unicorn: The Onager and the Oryx in the Arabic Ode|journal=[[Journal of Arabic Literature]]|year=2002|volume=33|issue=2|pages=79–130|doi=10.1163/157006402320379371}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zahra|first=A.

Modern [[Iraq]] still has a tradition of "tears of the karkadann," ''dumiu al-karkadan'', which are reddish beads used in the [[Misbaha]], the Muslim prayer beads (''subuhat''). The accompanying legend says that the rhinoceros spends days in the desert looking for water; when he does, he first weeps "out of fatigue and thirst-pain." These tears, as they fall into the water of the drinking hole, turn into beads.&lt;ref name=stetkevych/&gt;

Peter Beagle wrote a story, "My Son Heydari and the Karkadann," in The Overneath (c)2017.

== Creation of the Kojiki ==
[[Emperor Tenmu]] ordered [[Hieda no Are]] to memorize stories and texts from history, many of which appear to have been, until the creation of the Kojiki, commonly known [[oral tradition]]s. Beyond this memorization nothing occurred until after [[Empress Jitō]] and [[Emperor Monmu]] had both passed and [[Empress Genmei]] came to reign. According to the Kojiki, Empress Genmei on the 18th of the 9th month of 711 ordered the courtier [[Ō no Yasumaro]] to record what had been learned by Hieda no Are. He finished and presented his work to Empress Genmei on the 28th of the 1st month of 712.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/243566096|title=Political thought in Japanese historical writing : from Kojiki (712) to Tokushi Yoron (1712)|last=S.|first=Brownlee, John|date=1991|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|isbn=9780889209978|location=Waterloo, Ont.|oclc=243566096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political purpose of the Kojiki ==
As evidenced in the preface of the Kojiki, which states the purpose of its creation as "to erase falsehoods and establish truth", the Kojiki, as well as the [[Nihon Shoki]], were works created with the primary purpose of furthering the imperial agenda. Created not long after the conclusion of the tumultuous [[Jinshin Rebellion]], the Kojiki establishes a pro-Yamato narrative of history which combined with what would become the officially accepted imperial narrative, the Nihon Shoki, would help secure both a historical as well as a divine legitimacy and superiority to a dynasty which would survive up to the [[Atomic Age|atomic era]]. This historical narrative is clearly broken into the Age of Gods and the Age of Human Emperors, wherein the mythology of the gods which gave birth to the land is told and is transitioned in a chronological fashion to the reign of the emperors, who descend from these same gods. This narrative clearly sets forth the divine mandate by which the [[Imperial House of Japan|Yamato line]] has right to rule, and through the rhetoric used in the Age of Human Emperors, much of it borrowed from Chinese sources, the historical and military qualifications were likewise established. Several of the narratives which give support to the imperial line, such as the subjugation of certain Korean Empires, have been confirmed as historically false and were included merely to erase failures and bolster reputations of emperors past. Vast amounts of the Age of Human Emperors is spent recounting genealogies, which served not only to give age to the imperial family, which was likely much newer than the Kojiki claims as little evidence has been found to support the existence of early emperors, but also served to tie, whether true or not, many existing clan's genealogies to their own. Regardless of the original intent of the Kojiki, it finalized and possibly even formulated the framework by which Japanese history was examined in terms of the reign of emperors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Study of the ''Kojiki'' ==
[[File:Kojiki den.jpg|thumb|right|280px|''Kojiki-den'' by Motoori Norinaga]]
In the [[Edo period]], [[Motoori Norinaga]] studied the ''Kojiki'' intensively. He produced a 44-volume study of the ''Kojiki'' called {{nihongo|''[[Kojiki-den]]''|古事記伝||"''Kojiki'' commentary"}}.

==Manuscripts==
There are two major branches of ''Kojiki'' manuscripts: Ise and Urabe. The extant Urabe branch consists of 36 existing manuscripts all based on the 1522 copies by Urabe Kanenaga. The Ise branch may be subdivided into the {{nihongo|Shinpukuji-bon|真福寺本}} manuscript of 1371–1372 and the {{nihongo|Dōka-bon|道果本}} manuscripts. The Dōka sub-branch consists of:
*the {{nihongo|Dōka-bon|道果本}} manuscript of 1381; only the first half of the first volume remains
*the {{nihongo|Dōshō-bon|道祥本}} manuscript of 1424; only the first volume remains, and there are many defects
*the {{nihongo|Shun'yu-bon|春瑜本}} manuscript of 1426; one volume

The Shinpukuji-bon manuscript (1371–1372) is the oldest existing manuscript. While divided into the Ise branch, it is actually a mixture of the two branches. The monk Ken'yu based his copy on Ōnakatomi Sadayo's copy. In 1266, Sadayo copied volumes one and three, but did not have access to the second volume. Finally, in 1282, he obtained access to the second volume through a Urabe-branch manuscript that he used to transcribe.

==Structure==
The ''Kojiki'' contains various songs and poems. While the historical records and myths are written in a form of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] with a heavy mixture of Japanese elements, the songs are written with [[Chinese character]]s, though only used phonetically. This special use of Chinese characters is called ''[[Man'yōgana]]'', a knowledge of which is critical to understanding these songs, which are written in [[Old Japanese]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/773348868|title=The idea of writing : writing across borders|date=2012|publisher=Brill|others=Voogt, Alexander J. de., Quack, Joachim Friedrich, 1966-|isbn=9789004215450|location=Leiden|oclc=773348868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sections===

The ''Kojiki'' is divided into three parts: the {{nihongo|''Kamitsumaki''|上巻|"first volume"}}, the {{nihongo|''Nakatsumaki''|中巻||"middle volume"}} and the {{nihongo|''Shimotsumaki''|下巻||"lower volume"}}.

*The ''Kamitsumaki'', also known as the {{nihongo|''Kamiyo no Maki''|神代巻||"Volume of the Age of the Gods"}}, includes the [[preface]] of the ''Kojiki'', and is focused on the deities of creation and the births of various deities of the ''kamiyo'' (神代) period, or [[Age of the Gods]]. The ''Kamitsumaki'' also outlines the myths concerning the foundation of Japan. It describes how [[Ninigi-no-Mikoto]], grandson of [[Amaterasu]] and great-grandfather of [[Emperor Jimmu]], descended from [[Takamagahara|heaven]] to Takachihonomine in [[Kyūshū]] and became the [[ancestor|progenitor]] of the Japanese imperial line.&lt;ref name="e" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kokugo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Japan |title=Ninigi no Mikoto |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |accessdate=2012-09-18 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |oclc=56431036 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archivedate=2007-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''Nakatsumaki'' begins with the story of [[Emperor Jimmu]], the first [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]], and his conquest of Japan, and ends with the 15th Emperor, [[Emperor Ōjin]]. The [[Emperor Suizei|second]] through [[Emperor Kaika|ninth]] emperors' reigns are recorded in a minimum of detail, with only their names, the names of their various descendants, and the place-names of their palaces and tombs listed, and no mention of their achievements. Many of the stories in this volume are mythological, and the allegedly historical information in them is highly suspect. Recent studies support the view that these emperors were invented to push Jimmu's reign further back to the year 660 BC.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}
*The ''Shimotsumaki'' covers the 16th to 33rd emperors and, unlike previous volumes, has very limited references to the interactions with deities.  These interactions are very prominent in the first and second volumes. Information about the 24th to the 33rd emperors is largely missing, as well.

== Background ==
Lamplighters Yeshivah is one of the 47 plus [[Jewish]] [[Montessori]]-style [[Hebrew day school]]s or yeshivas in the United States. Lamplighters is located in [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]], [[Brooklyn]] and is catered to parents from the local [[Chabad]] [[Hasidic]] community.&lt;ref name="lamp NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bkreader.com/2014/02/religious-diversity-freedom-and-choice-emphasized-at-jewish-montessori-schools-a-relatively-new-model-growing-in-popularity/ "'DIVERSITY, FREEDOM AND CHOICE’ EMPHASIZED AT JEWISH MONTESSORIS, A RELATIVELY NEW, GROWING EDUCATIONAL MODEL."] February 23, 2014. ''The Brooklyn Reader''. Accessed May 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was founded in November 2009, with just four families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lamplightersyeshivah.com/#!about_us/c1q1e About Us. Lamplighters Yeshivah. Accessed February 21, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2016-17 school year, the school has expanded to 131 students in eight classes: two primary, three lower elementary and two upper elementary.

The executive director of Lamplighters is Yocheved Sidof. The Heads of School are Moshe and Rivkah Schack.

The name "Lamplighters" was chosen for the school based on the Hasidic teaching&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2183/jewish/The-Lamplighter.htm The Lamplighter. ''Chabad.org''. Accessed February 21, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; that each person can better the world and "transform darkness into light".&lt;ref name="lamp sis"/&gt;

== Educational style ==
Lamplighters incorporates both Jewish and general topics in their curriculum. Teaching methods are heavily influenced by Montessori educational methods. Lessons often blend traditional Jewish topics with general Montessori activities.&lt;ref name="lamp NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/national-news/jewish-montessori-becomes-movement "Jewish Motessori Becomes Movement."] ''The Jewish Week''.

The [[Talmud]] uses many types of [[logical argument]]s.

==Chazakah==
{{main article|Chazakah}}
A ''Chazakah'' ({{lang-he|חזקה}}) usually refers to the default assumption; i.e. what is assumed until there is evidence to the contrary. For example, if one is known to have owned property, it is assumed that he still owns it until proven otherwise. However, with movable items, the ''Chazakah'' lies with whoever currently has the item in his possession, not with the one who had previously owned it.

This principle also applies to non-monetary cases, such as that food known to be kosher maintains its status until there is evidence to the contrary. Also, one who engages in acts done only by [[Kohanim]] (priests) is assumed to be a kohen himself, until proven otherwise. (See [[status quo Kohen]].)

==De'oraita and derabanan==
A law is ''de'oraita'' ({{lang-he-n|דאורייתא}}) if it is derived from the [[Torah]]; if a law is ''derabanan'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|דרבנן}}) it is mandated by the rabbinical sages. The concepts of ''de-'oraita'' ({{lang-arc|דאורייתא}}) and ''de-rabbanan''  ({{lang-arc|דרבנן|links=no}}) are used extensively in discussion of [[Jewish]] law and are of concern for modern observance of [[Judaism]].

The former refers to [[halacha|halachic requirements]] that rabbinic literature understands to be Biblically mandated, while the latter refers to halachic requirements that are rabbinically mandated.&lt;ref&gt;''Promising Justice: Derrida with Jewish Jurisprudence'' A Hirvonen - Law and Critique, 2001 - Springer "Thus, those commandments (mitzvot) that come directly from the Torah (de'oraita) and are biblical, are a superior authority to those rabbinic ones which do not come from it (de'rabbanan). The de'oraita ... "&lt;/ref&gt;  In Aramaic, ''de-'oraita'' means "from the [[Torah]]" and ''de-rabbanan'' means ''from our [[Rabbi]]s''.

Sometimes it isn't clear whether the verse has been quoted as an [[Asmachta (Talmudical hermeneutics)|Asmachta]] (hint) or as a source, what might lead to a controversy over the ''de'oraita'' or ''derabanan'' quality of the law. An example for such case is the controversy over the quality of ''[[berakhah]] levatala'' - the prohibition to say a prayer outside its context. The Talmud says whoever says unneeded berakhah violates the verse ''[[Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Hebrew source text: "כל המברך ברכה שאינה צריכה עובר משום לא תשא" ([[:he:s:ברכות לג א|Berachot 33a]])&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Maimonides]] sees it as a source,&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishneh Torah]], [[:he:s:רמב"ם הלכות ברכות א טו|Berachot 1, 15]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tosafot]] sees it as an asmachta.&lt;ref&gt;The Aramaic source text: "ומשום דמברך ברכה שאינה צריכה וקעבר משום בל תשא ליכא דההיא דרשה דרבנן" (Tosafot on [[:he:s:ראש השנה לג א|Rosh Hashanah 33a]])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of terminology===
Examples of the application of these two terms abound.  One such application appears in the laws relating to [[Birkat Hamazon|grace after meals]].  There are four blessings contained within the grace after meals, and while the first three are biblically mandated, the fourth blessing was added much later on in Jewish history and is rabbinically mandated ([[Bavli#Talmud Bavli .28Babylonian Talmud.29|B.]] [[Berakhot (Talmud)|Brachot]]  45b)  The first three blessings would thus be referred to as ''de-'oraita'' and the last blessing would be referred to as ''de-rabbanan''.

Another example are the commandments regarding the famous phrase "Thou shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk." From this, many laws of kashrut are derived by the rabbis. One might think this would make it ''de-rabbanan'' because it was derived by the rabbis, but the laws are actually ''de-'oraita'' because they are derived by interpreting the Torah.{{cn|date=April 2018}}  On the other hand, the extension of this prohibition to eating chicken with milk is ''de-rabbanan'' as it is the product of a specific Rabbinic enactment.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

===Modern observance===
The application of differences between rabbinic and biblical mitzvot can sometimes make practical differences.

;Rules of precedence
:If a d'oraita rule comes into conflict with a d'rabbanan rule, the d'oraita rule (Torah rule) always takes precedence.&lt;ref name="jewfaq.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/halakhah.htm#Differences|title=Judaism 101: Halakhah: Jewish Law|website=www.jewfaq.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Sofek (cases of doubt)
:Sofek means a case where you are uncertain about the factual circumstances, i.e. one does not remember whether he or she said a portion of tefila or a berekha. If there is doubt about a fact where a d'oraita rule applies, the strict position regarding the rule is taken (the repeat fulfillment of the rule is taken); if there is doubt in a matter that is d'rabbanan, the lenient position is taken regarding the rule (the act is not repeated and it is ignored).&lt;ref name="jewfaq.org"/&gt;
;Bediavad (extenuating circumstances)
:In cases of extenuating circumstances regarding a rabbinic law, decisors of Jewish law sometimes apply the law leniently.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yoatzot.org/article.php?id=88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kal Vachomer (A fortiori)==
{{main article|kal vachomer}}
A ''kal vachomer'' ({{lang-he|קל וחומר}}, literally "lenient and strict") derives one law from another through the following logic: If a case that is generally strict has a particular leniency, a case that is generally lenient will certainly have that leniency. The argument can also work in reverse, and also in areas where ''lenient'' or ''strict'' might not be precisely applicable.

==Migo&lt;!--Migos redirects here--&gt;==
A ''migo'' ({{lang-he|מיגו}}, literally "out of" or "since") is an argument for a defendant that he ought to be believed regarding a certain claim, because he could have made a different claim which would definitely have been believed. 

For example, if someone admits to having borrowed money and claims to have paid it back, he is believed because he could have claimed that he never borrowed the money in the first place (absent other evidence for the loan).{{cn|date=March 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="88718">This is a list of animals whose names appear in the [[Bible]]. Whenever required for the identification, the [[Hebrew]] name will be indicated, as well as the specific term used by [[zoologist]]s. This list will include names such as [[griffon]], [[Lamia (mythology)|lamia]], [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]] and [[unicorn]], which, though generally applied to fabulous beings, have nevertheless, because of misunderstandings or educational prejudices of the [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] translators, crept into the versions, and have been applied to real animals. In the following list D.V. stands for [[Douai Bible|Douay Version]], A.V. and R.V. for [[Authorized Version|Authorized]] and [[Revised Version]] respectively.
{{Compact ToC|x=|y=|z=|refs=yes}}

==A==
*[[Addax]]&amp;nbsp;— A kind of [[antelope]] (antilope addax) with twisted horns; it very probably corresponds to the dîshõn of the Hebrews and the pygarg of the divers translations ([[Deuteronomy]] 14:5).
*[[Vipera berus|Adder]]&amp;nbsp;— A poisonous [[snake]] of the genus ''[[Vipera]]''. The word, unused in the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]], stands in the [[Authorized Version|A.V.]] for four different Hebrew names of serpents.
*[[Ant]] ([[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 6:6; 30:25)&amp;nbsp;— Over twelve [[species]] of ants exist in [[Israel]]; among them the ants of the genus ''[[Atta (genus)|Atta]]'' are particularly common, especially the ''Atta barbara'', of dark color, and the ''Atta structor'', a brown species. These, with the ''[[Pheidole]] megacephala'', are, unlike the ants of northern countries, accustomed to lay up stores of grain for winter use. Hence the allusions of the wise man in the two above-mentioned passages of [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]].
*[[Antelope]]&amp;nbsp;— The word, first applied as a qualification to the [[gazelle]], on account of the lustre and soft expression of its eye, has become the name of a [[genus]] of ruminant [[quadruped]]s intermediate between the [[deer]] and the [[goat]]. Four species are mentioned in the Bible:
**(1) the dîshon ([[Douai Bible|D.V.]] pygarg; [[Deuteronomy]] 14:5), commonly identified with the antilope addax;
**(2) the çebhî ([[Deuteronomy]] 12:15, etc.; [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] roe) or gazelle, antilope dorcas;
**(3) the'ô (Deuteronomy 14:5; [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] wild goat; [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 51:20, [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] wild ox), which seems to be the bubale (antilope bubalis); and
**(4) the yáhmûr ([[Deuteronomy]] 14:5), the name of which is given by the [[Arab]]s to the [[Roe deer|roebuck]] of Northern [[Syria]] and to the [[oryx]] (the white antelope, antilope oryx) of the [[desert]].
*[[Ape]]&amp;nbsp;— Nowhere in the Bible is the ape supposed to be indigenous to Israel. Apes are mentioned with [[gold]], [[silver]], [[ivory]], and [[peacock]]s among the precious things imported by [[Solomon]] from [[Tarshish|Tharsis]] ([[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] 10:22; [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 9:21). The "ape" of the KJV is what is called an [[Old World monkey]] today. "True apes" (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and gibbons) were known of only later.
*[[Asp (reptile)|Asp]]&amp;nbsp;— This word, which occurs eleven times in [[Douai Bible|D.V.]], stands for four Hebrew names:
**(1) Péthén [Deut., xxxii, 33; [[Book of Job|Job]], xx, 14, 16; [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]]., lvii (Hebr., lviii), 5; [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], xi, 8]. From several allusions both to its deadly [[venom]] (Deuteronomy 32:33), and to its use by [[Snake charming|serpent-charmers]] [Ps., lvii (Hebr., lviii), 5, 6], it appears that the [[cobra]] (naja aspis) is most probably signified. Safely to step upon its body, or even linger by the hole where it coils itself, is manifestly a sign of God's particular protection [Ps., xc (Hebr., xci), 13; Is., xi, 8]. [[Sophar]], one of [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]]'s friends, speaks of the wicked as sucking the venom of péthén, in punishment whereof the food he takes shall be turned within him into the gall of this poisonous reptile ([[Book of Job|Job]] 20:16, 14).
**(2) 'Akhshûbh, mentioned only once in the Hebrew Bible, namely Ps., cxl (Vulg., cxxxix), 4, but manifestly alluded to in Ps., xiii, 3, and Rom., iii, 13, seems to have been one of the most highly poisonous kinds of viper, perhaps the toxicoa, also called [[echis]] arenicola or scytale of the Pyramids, very common in Syria and North Africa.
**(3) Sháhál is also found only once to signify a snake, Ps., xci (Vulg., xc), 13; but what particular kind of snake we are unable to determine. The word Sháhál might possibly, owing to some copyist's mistake, have crept into the place of another name now impossible to restore.
**(4) çphônî (Isaiah 59:5), "the hisser", generally rendered by basilisk in I[[Douai Bible|D.V.]] and in ancient translations, the latter sometimes calling it regulus. This snake was deemed so deadly that, according to the common saying, its hissing alone, even its look, was fatal. It was probably a small viper, perhaps a [[Cerastes (genus)|cerastes]], possibly the [[daboia]] zanthina, according to Cheyne.
*[[Donkey|Ass]]&amp;nbsp;— The ass has always enjoyed a marked favour above all other [[Working animal|beasts of burden]] in the Bible. This is evidenced by more than one hundred and thirty mentions of this animal in Bible, and by the number of words in the Hebrew vocabulary used to designate the ass, by colour, sex, age, and so forth, in striking contrast with the ordinary penury of the sacred language. Of these various names the most common is hamôr, "reddish", the hair of the eastern ass being generally of that colour. White asses, more rare, were also more appreciated and reserved for the use of the nobles ([[Book of Judges|Judges]] 5:10). The custom was introduced very early, as it seems, and still prevails, to paint the most shapely and valuable donkeys in stripes of different colours. In the East the ass is much larger and finer than in other countries, and in several places the pedigrees of the best breeds are carefully preserved. Asses have always been an important item in the resources of the Eastern peoples, and we are repeatedly told in the Bible about the herds of these animals owned by the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchs]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 12:16; 30:43; 36:24, etc.), and wealthy [[Israelites]] ([[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 9:3; 1 Chronicles 27:30, etc.). Hence the several regulations brought forth by Israel's lawgiver on this subject: the neighbour's ass should not be coveted ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 20:17); moreover, should the neighbour's stray ass be found, it should be taken care of, and its owner assisted in tending this part of his herd (Deuteronomy 22:3, 4).

:The ass serves in the East for many purposes. Its even gait and [[sure-footedness]], so well suited to the rough paths of the Holy Land, made it at all times the most popular of all the animals for riding in those hilly regions (Genesis 22:3; [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 19:30). Neither was it ridden only by the common people, but also by persons of the highest rank (Judges 5:10; 10:4; 2 Samuel 17:23; 19:26, etc.). No wonder therefore that [[Jesus]], about to come triumphantly to [[Jerusalem]], commanded His [[Twelve Apostles|disciples]] to bring Him an ass and her colt; no lesson of humility, as is sometimes asserted, but the affirmation of the peaceful character of His [[Kingdom of God|kingdom]] should be sought there. Although the Scripture speaks of "saddling" the ass, usually no [[saddle]] was used by the rider. A cloth was spread upon the back of the ass and fastened by a strap was all the equipment. Upon this cloth the rider sat with a servant usually walking alongside. Should a family journey, the women and children would ride the asses, attended by the father (Exodus 4:20). This mode of traveling has been popularized by Christian painters, who copied the eastern customs in their representations of the [[Holy Family]]'s [[flight to Egypt]].

:Scores of passages in the Bible allude to asses carrying burdens. The [[Gospels]], at least in the Greek text, speak of [[millstone]]s run by asses ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 18:6, [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 9:41; Luke 17:2); [[Josephus]] and the Egyptian monuments teach us that this animal was used for threshing [[wheat]]. Finally, we repeatedly read in the Old Testament of asses hitched to a [[plough]] ([[Deuteronomy]] 22:10; [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 30:24, etc.), and in reference to this custom, the Law forbade ploughing with an ox and an ass together ([[Deuteronomy]] 22:10). From Is., xxi, 7, confirmed by the statements of Greek writers, we learn that part of the cavalry force in the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] army rode donkeys. We should perhaps understand from IV K., vii, 7, that the Syrian armies followed the same practice; but no such custom seems to have ever prevailed among the [[Hebrews]]. With them the ass was essentially for peaceful use, the emblem of peace, as the horse was the symbol of war. The flesh of the donkey was unclean and forbidden by [[Torah|the Law]]. In some particular circumstances, however, no law could prevail over necessity, and we read that during [[Jehoram of Israel|Joram]]'s reign, when [[Ben-Hadad III|Ben-hadad]] besieged [[Samaria]], the famine was so extreme in this city, that the head of an ass was sold for 120 pieces of silver (IV K., vi, 25).

*[[Donkey|Ass, colt]]&amp;nbsp;— This is more specially the symbol of peace and meek obedience ([[Gospel of John|John]] 12:15).
*[[African wild ass|Ass, wild]], corresponds in the Old Testament to two words, péré' and 'arôdh. Whether these two names refer to different species, or are, the one, the genuine Hebrew name, the other, the Aramaic equivalent for the same animal, is uncertain. Both signify one of the wildest and most untamable animals. The wild ass is larger and more shapely than the domestic one, and outruns the fleetest horse. Its strength joined to its nimbleness and love of freedom made it a fit symbol for the first born son of Abraham who like Joseph was separated from his father and like Joseph became a great leader[Y'shmaEL],[[Ishmael|Ismael]][ gen;17;20] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 16:12). The wild ass, extinct in western Asia, still exists in central Asia and the deserts of Africa.
*[[Attacus]] (Leviticus 11:22)&amp;nbsp;— Instead of this Latin word, the [[Authorized Version|A.V.]] reads bald-locust. According to the tradition enshrined in the [[Talmud]], the common truxalis, a [[locust]] with a very long smooth head is probably signified.
*[[Aurochs]], or wild ox (urus, bos primigenius), is undoubtedly the rimu of the Assyrian inscriptions, and consequently corresponds to the re'em or rêm of the Hebrews. The latter word is translated sometimes in the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] as [[rhinoceros]] ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 23:22; 24:8; [[Deuteronomy]] 33:17; Job 39:9, 10), sometimes by [[unicorn]] (Psalm 22:21; 29:6; 92:10; Isaiah 34:7). That the re'em, far from being unicorn, was a two-horned animal, is suggested by Ps., xxii, 21, and forcibly evidenced by Deut., xxxiii, 17, where its horns represent the two tribes of [[Ephraim]] and Manasses. That, moreover, it was akin to the domestic ox is shown from such parallelisms as we find in Ps., xxiv, 6, where we read, according to the critical editions of the Hebrew text: "The voice of [[Yahweh]] makes [[Lebanon]] skip like a bullock, and [[Mount Hermon|Sirion]] like a young re'em"; or Is., xxxiv, 7: "And the re'em shall go down with them, and the bulls with the mighty"; and still more convincingly by such implicit descriptions as that of [[Book of Job|Job]], xxxix, 9, 10: "Shall the rêm be willing to serve thee, or will he stay at thy crib? Canst thou bind the rêm with thy thong to plough, or will he break the clods of the valleys after thee?" These references will be very clear, the last especially, once we admit the re'em is an almost untamable wild ox, which one would try in vain to submit to the same work as its domestic kin. Hence there is very little doubt that in all the above-mentioned places the word aurochs should be substituted for rhinoceros and unicorn. The aurochs is for the sacred poets a familiar emblem of untamed strength and ferocity. It no longer exists in western Asia.

==B==
*[[Baboon]], a kind of dog-faced, long-haired [[monkey]], dwelling among ruins (gen. Cynocephalus); it was an object of worship for the [[Egyptians]]. Some deem it to be the "hairy one" spoken of in Is., xiii, 21 and xxxiv, 14, but it is very doubtful whether it ever existed west of the [[Euphrates]].
*[[Badger]] ''Tahashim''&amp;nbsp;— No mention of the badger ([[Meles (genus)|meles]] taxus) is found in the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]], whereas the [[Authorized Version|A.V.]] regularly gives it as the English equivalent for táhásh. ''Skins of táháshim'' are repeatedly spoken of as used for the outer coverings of the [[tabernacle]] and of the several pieces of its furniture and utensils and tools. The old translations, and the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] after them, understood the word táhásh to mean a color (violet; [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 25:5; 26:14; 35:7, 23; 36:19; 39:34; [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 4:6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 25; [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 16:10); but this is a "misrepresentation" according to [[Talmudist|Talmudic writers]];&lt;ref name=ISBE&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' (1915, 1939): B: badger.&lt;/ref&gt; so also is the rendering of the [[Authorized Version|A.V.]]; for though the badger is common in Israel, yet the Hebrew name "most probably" (''according to 19th and early 20th century scholars'') indicates the [[dugong]] (designated ''halicore hemprichii'' 1832, and ''halicore tabernaculi'' 1843), a [[sirenian]] living in the Red Sea, the skin of which is used to the present day by [[Bedouin]] [[Arabs]] for such purposes as those alluded to in the Bible.&lt;ref name=ISBE/&gt; Nevertheless, this is in contradiction to Leviticus 11:10&lt;ref&gt;Hewlett, John Grigg, D.D. ''Bible difficulties explained'' (1860), pages 159–163 {{ISBN|978-0559757136}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (KJV) "''And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an [[abomination (Bible)|abomination]] unto you.''"  And Leviticus 11:27 says clearly (including the badger), "''And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on all four, those are [[Unclean animals|unclean]] unto you:  whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.''"  Leviticus explicitly commands the Jews, "''Ye shall not make yourselves abominable''..." (11:41–47). [[Strong's Concordance]] BADGERS' number 8476 תחש ''tachash'' says the word is probably of [[Loanword|foreign derivation]]; a (clean) animal with fur, probably a species of ''antelope''—badger. The opinion that tahash denotes the dugong is declining in recent decades in favor of "blue-processed skins" (''Navigating the Bible II'') and "(blue-)beaded skins" (''Anchor Bible''.)
*[[Basilisk]] occurs in the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] as an equivalent for several Hebrew names of snakes:
**(1) Péthén (Ps. xc, 13), the cobra; had the Latin and English translators been more consistent they would have rendered this Hebrew word here, as in the other places, by asp;
**(2) Céphá' and Cíphe 'ônî (Prov., xxiii, 32; Is., xi. 8; xiv, 29; Jer., viii, '17;
**(3) 'éphe'éh ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 59:5), a kind of viper impossible to determine, or perhaps the [[echis]] arenicola;
**(4) flying sãrãph ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 14:29; 30:6), a winged serpent (?), possibly also a reptile like the [[Draco lizard|draco]] fimbriatus, which, having long ribs covered with a fringe-like skin, is able to glide through the air for short distances.
*[[Bat]]&amp;nbsp;— The bat, fourteen species of which still exist in Israel is reckoned among unclean "winged things" ([[Leviticus]] 11:19; [[Deuteronomy]] 14:18). Its abode is generally in dark and desolate places such as ruins and caverns.
*[[Bear]]&amp;nbsp;— The bear spoken of in the Bible is the ''[[Ursus (genus)|Ursus]] syriacus'', scarcely different from the [[brown bear]] of Europe. Since the destruction of the forests, it is now rarely seen south of Lebanon and [[Hermon]], where it is common. Not infrequently met in the [[Holy Land]] during the Old Testament times, it was much dreaded on account of its ferocious and destructive instincts; to dare it was accordingly a mark of uncommon courage ([[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 17:34–36). Its terror-striking roars and its fierceness, especially when robbed of its cubs, are repeatedly alluded to.
*Beast, wild&amp;nbsp;— The expression occurs twice in the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]], but much oftener in the [[Authorized Version|A.V.]], and R. V., where it is in several places a substitute for the awkward "beast of the field", the Hebrew name of wild animals at large. The first time we read of "wild beasts" in the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]], it fairly stands for the Hebrew word zîz [Ps. lxxix (Hebr., lxxx), 14], albeit the "singular wild beast" is a clumsy translation. The same Hebrew word in Ps. xlix, 11, at least for consistency's sake, should have been rendered in the same manner; "the beauty of the field" must consequently be corrected into "wild beast". In Is., xiii, 21, "wild beasts" is an equivalent for the Hebr. Ciyyîm, i. e. denizens of the desert. This word in different places has been translated in divers manners: [[demon]]s ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 34:14), [[dragon]]s (Psalm 73:14; [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 1:39); it possibly refers to the [[hyena]].
*[[Bee]]&amp;nbsp;— Israel, according to Scripture, is a land flowing with [[honey]] ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 3:8). Its dry climate, its rich abundance, and variety of aromatic [[flower]]s, and its limestone rocks render it particularly adapted for bees. No wonder then that [[honey bee]]s, both wild and hived, abound there. All the different species known by the names of bombus, nomia, andrena, osmia, megachile, anthophora, are widely spread throughout the country. The hived honey bee of Israel, [[Apis (genus)|apis]] fasciata, belongs to a variety slightly different from ours, characterized by yellow stripes on the abdomen. Wild bees are said to live not only in rocks [Ps. lxxx (Hebr., lxxxi), 17], but in hollow trees (1 [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]] 14:25), even in dried carcasses ([[Book of Judges|Judges]] 14:8). Syrian and Egyptian hives are made of a mash of clay and straw for coolness. In Old Testament times, honey was an article of [[export]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 43:11; [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 27:17). Bees are spoken of in Bible as a term of comparison for a numerous army relentlessly harassing their enemies. Debôrah, the Hebrew name for bee, was a favourite name for women.
*[[Beetle]], given by [[Authorized Version|A.V.]] ([[Leviticus]] 11:22) as an equivalent for Hebrew, árbéh, does not meet the requirements of the context: "Hath the legs behind longer wherewith it hoppeth upon the earth", any more than the bruchus of [[Douai Bible|D.V.]], some species of [[locust]], the locusta migratoria being very likely intended.
*[[Behemoth]], is generally translated as "great beasts"; in its wider signification it includes all [[mammal]]s living on earth, but in the stricter sense is applied to [[domesticated]] [[quadruped]]s at large. However, in [[Book of Job|Job]], xl, 10, where it is left untranslated and considered a proper name, it indicates a particular animal. The description of this animal has long puzzled the commentators. Many of them now admit that it represents the [[hippopotamus]]; it might possibly correspond as well to the [[rhinoceros]].
*[[Bird]]&amp;nbsp;— No other classification of birds than into [[Clean animals|clean]] and [[Unclean animals|unclean]] is given. The Jews, before the [[Babylonian captivity]], had no domestic [[poultry]] except [[pigeon]]s. Although many birds are mentioned, there occur few allusions to their habits. Their instinct of [[Bird migration|migration]], the snaring or netting them, and the caging of song birds are referred to.
*Bird, dyed&amp;nbsp;— So does the English version, Jer., xii, 9, wrongly interpret the Hebrew 'áyit. which means beast of prey, sometimes also bird of prey.
*Bird, singing&amp;nbsp;— This singing bird of Soph., ii, 14, according to the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]], owes its origin to a mistranslation of the original, which most probably should be read: "And their voice shall sing at the window"; unless by a mistake of some scribe, the word qôl, voice, has been substituted for the name of some particular bird.
*Birds, speckled, Hebrew çãbhûá' ([[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 12:9). A much discussed translation. The interpretation of the English versions, however meaningless it may seem to some, is supported by the [[Targum]], the [[Syriac language|Syriac]], and [[St. Jerome]]. In spite of these authorities many modern scholars prefer to use the word [[hyena]], given by the [[Septuagint]] and confirmed by [[Wisdom of Sirach|Sirach]], xiii, 22 as well as by the Arabic (dábúh) and rabbinical Hebrew (çebhôá'), names of the hyena.
*[[Bison]], According to several authors, the re'em of the Bible. It belongs to the same genus as the [[aurochs]], but being indigenous to America (whence its name, [[bos]] americanus), and specifically different from the aurochs, cannot possibly have been known by the Hebrews, unless it was the European species (which did lived in the Caucasus) 
*[[Bittern]] (botháurus vulgaris), a shy, solitary, wading bird related to the [[heron]] and inhabiting the recesses of [[swamp]]s, where its startling, booming cry at night gives a frightening impression of desolation. In the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]], bittern stands for Hebr. qã'ãth ([[Leviticus]] 11:18; [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 34:11; [[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]] 2:14), although by some inconsistency the same Hebrew word is rendered Deut., xiv, 17, by cormorant, and Ps. ci (Hebr., cii), 7, by [[pelican]]. The pelican meets all the requirements of all the passages where qã'ãth is mentioned, and would perhaps be a better translation than bittern.
*Blast certainly, designates, Deut., xxviii, 42, a voracious [[insect]]; the Hebrew çelãçál, "chirping", suggests that the [[cricket]] was possibly meant and might be substituted for blast. In Ps. lxxvii (Hebr., lxxviii), 46, blast stands for hãsîl, "the destroyer", perhaps the locust in its caterpillar state, in which it is most destructive.
*[[Wild boar|Boar, wild]]&amp;nbsp;— The only allusion to this animal is found Ps. lxxix (Hebr., lxxx), 14; however, the wild boar was undoubtedly always, as it is now, common in Israel, having its lair in the woods, and most destructive to [[vineyard]]s.
*[[Bruchus]]&amp;nbsp;— Though it occurs once ([[Leviticus]] 11:22) as an equivalent for Hebrew, 'ârbéh (probably the locusta migratoria), the word bruchus is the regular interpretation for yéléq, "licker". The biblical bruchus may be fairly identified with the [[beetle]], or some insect akin to it. Anyway, the yéléq of Jer., li, 14, 27, should have been rendered in the same manner as everywhere else.
*[[Bubale]], antilope bubalis, or alcephalus bubalis, which should not be confounded with the bubale, bos bubalus, is probably signified by the Hebrew, the'ô, interpreted by the Douay translators, [[wild goat]], in Deut., xiv, 5, and wild ox, Is., li, 20. It still exists in Israel, but was formerly much more common than now.
*[[bison|Buffalo]] (bos bubalus)&amp;nbsp;— So does the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] translate the Hebrew, yáhmûr, III K., iv, 23 (Hebrews 1 [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]] 5:3). Being a denizen of [[marsh]]y and [[swamp]]y lands, the buffalo must have been scarcely known by the Hebrews. Moreover, its coarse, unpleasant-smelling flesh seems to exclude the identification with the animal referred to in the above-mentioned passage, where we should probably read [[Roe deer|roebuck]].
*[[Buffle]]&amp;nbsp;— Another word for [[bison|buffalo]], [[Douai Bible|D.V.]], Deut., xiv, 5. According to good authorities, the [[oryx]], or white antelope, might be here intended, the Hebrew word yáhmûr possibly meaning, as its Arabic equivalent does, both the roebuck and the oryx.
*[[Bull]]&amp;nbsp;— A symbol of fierce and relentless adversaries [Ps. xxi (Hebr., xxii), 13].
*[[Cattle|Bullock]]&amp;nbsp;— The bullock, as yet unaccustomed to the [[yoke]], is an image of Israel's insubordinate mind before he was subdued by the [[Babylonian captivity|captivity]] ([[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 31:18).
*[[Buzzard]] (Hebr., rã'ah)&amp;nbsp;— Probably the ringtail of [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] and the glede of [[Authorized Version|A.V.]] ([[Deuteronomy]] 14:13); possibly, through a scribe's error, might be identified with the kite, dã'ah, of Lev., xi, 14. The buzzard, three species of which exist in Israel, has always been common there.

==C==
*[[Calf]], One of the most popular representations of the [[deity]] among the [[Canaanites]]. The calf is, in biblical poetry, a figure for vexing and pitiless foes [Ps., xxi (Hebr., xxii), 13]. The fatted calf was a necessary feature, so to say, of a feast dinner.
*[[Camel]], a prominent domestic animal of the East without the existence of which life in the [[Arabian desert]]s would be impossible. It was perhaps the first [[Pack animal|beast of burden]] applied to the service of man. It is mentioned as such in the biblical records as early as the time of [[Abraham]]. Recent excavations in the [[Timna Valley]] discovered what may be the earliest camel bones found in Israel or even outside the Arabian peninsula, dating to around 930 BCE. This is seen as evidence by some that the stories of [[Abraham]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], [[Jacob]] and [[Esau]] were written after this time.&lt;ref name=camels&gt;{{cite news|last=Hasson|first=Nir|title=Hump stump solved: Camels arrived in region much later than biblical reference|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/.premium-1.569091|accessdate=30 January 2014|newspaper=Haaretz|date=Jan 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sapir-Hen|first=Lidar|author2=Erez Ben-Yosef |title=The Introduction of Domestic Camels to the Southern Levant: Evidence from the Aravah Valley|journal=Tel Aviv|year=2013|volume=40|pages=277–285|url=http://archaeology.tau.ac.il/ben-yosef/pub/Pub_PDFs/Sapir-Hen&amp;Ben-Yosef13_CamelAravah_TelAviv.pdf|accessdate=16 February 2014|doi=10.1179/033443513x13753505864089}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Camelopardalis]], occurs only once in the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] ([[Deuteronomy]] 14:5), as a translation of zémér. The word, a mere transcription of the Latin and the Greek, is a combination of the names of the [[camel]] and the [[leopard]], and indicates the [[giraffe]]. But this translation, as well as that of the [[Authorized Version|A.V.]] (chamois), is doubtless erroneous; neither the giraffe nor the [[chamois]] ever lived in Israel. The wild sheep or [[mouflon]], which still lingers in [[Cyprus]] and Arabia Petrala, is very likely intended.
*[[Locust|Cankerworm]], the locust in its [[larva]] state, in which it is most voracious. So does [[Authorized Version|A.V.]] render the Hebrew, gãzám; the word palmerworm, given by the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] seems better.
*[[Cat]]&amp;nbsp;— Mention of this animal occurs only once in the Bible, namely Bar., vi, 21. The original text of [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]] being lost, we possess no indication as to what the Hebrew name of the cat may have been. Possibly there was not any; for although the cat was very familiar to the [[Egyptians]], it seems to have been altogether unknown to the [[Jews]], as well as to the [[Assyria]]ns and [[Babylonians]], even to the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] before the conquest of [[Egypt]]. These and other reasons have led some commentators to believe that the word cat, in the above cited place of Baruch, might not unlikely stand for another name now impossible to restore.
*[[Cattle]]&amp;nbsp;— Very early in the history of mankind, animals were tamed and domesticated, to be used in agriculture, for milk, for their flesh, and especially for sacrifices. Many words in Hebrew expressed the different ages and sexes of cattle, West of the [[Jordan River]] the cattle were generally stall-fed; in the plains and hills south and east they roamed in a half-wild state; such were the most famous "bulls of Basan".
*[[Cerastes (genus)|Cerastes]] (Hebr., shephîphõn) should be substituted in [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] for the colourless "serpent", Gen., xlix, 17. The identification of the shephîphõn with the deadly horned cerastes (cerastes hasselquistii or vipera cerastes) is evidenced by the Arabic name of the latter (shúffon), and its customs in perfect agreement with the indications of the Bible. The cerastes, one of the most venomous of snakes, is in the habit of coiling itself in little depressions such as camels' footmarks, and suddenly darting on any passing animal.
*[[Chameleon]] (Hebr., kôâh)&amp;nbsp;— Mentioned Lev., xi, 30, with the [[Mole (animal)|mole]] (Hebr., tínshéméth). In spite of the authority of the ancient translations, it is now generally admitted that the tínshéméth is the chameleon, very common in Israel; whereas the kôâh is a kind of large [[lizard]], perhaps the land monitor (psammosaurus scincus).
*[[Chamois]] (antilope rupicapra) is now totally unknown in western Asia, where it very probably never existed. The opinion of those who see it in the Hebrew zémér ([[Deuteronomy]] 14:5) should consequently be entirely discarded (see Camelopardalis).
*[[Charadrion]] (Hebrew anãphah, [[Leviticus]] 11:19; [[Deuteronomy]] 14:18) would be the [[plover]]; but it rather stands here for the [[heron]], all the species of which (this is the sense of the expression "according to its kind"), numerous in Israel, should be deemed unclean.
*[[Cherogrillus]] ([[Leviticus]] 11:5; [[Deuteronomy]] 14:7), a mere transliteration of the Greek name of the [[porcupine]], corresponds to the Hebrew shãphãn, translated in Ps. ciii (Hebr., civ), 18, as irchin, and in Prov., xxx, 26, as [[rabbit]]. As [[St. Jerome]] noticed it, the shãphãn is not the porcupine, but a very peculiar animal of about the same size, dwelling among the rocks, and in holes, and called in Israel "bear-rat", on account of some resemblance with these two quadrupeds. We call it coney, or daman ([[hyrax]] syriacus). Its habit of lingering among the rocks is alluded to, Ps. ciii, 18; its wisdom and defencelessness, Prov., xxx, 24–26. "It cannot burrow, for it has no claws, only nails half developed ; but it lies in holes in the rocks, and feeds only at dawn and dusk, always having sentries posted, at the slightest squeak from which the whole party instantly disappears. The coney is not a ruminant (cf. [[Leviticus]] 11:5), but it sits working its jaws as if re-chewing. It is found sparingly in most of the rocky districts, and is common about Sinai" (Tristram).
*[[Cobra]] ([[naja]] aspis), most likely the deadly snake called péthén by the Hebrews, found in Israel and Egypt and used by [[Snake charming|serpent-charmers]].
*[[Cochineal]] (coccus ilicis)&amp;nbsp;— A [[hemiptera]] homoptera insect very common on the Syrian holm-oak, from the female of which the crimson dye [[Kermes (dye)|kermes]] is prepared. The complete name in Hebrew is equivalent to "scarlet insect", the "insect" being not infrequently omitted in the translations.
*[[Chicken|Cock, hen]]&amp;nbsp;— Domestic [[poultry]] are not mentioned till after the [[Babylonian captivity]] is what some believe but others understand the "seal of Jaazaniah" from the ruins of the biblical Judean kingdom at [[Mizpah in Benjamin|Mizpah]], with the inscription of "belonging to Jaazaniah, servant to the king"&lt;ref&gt;A history of ancient Israel and Judah by James Maxwell Miller and John Haralson Hayes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavations in the Holy Land, edited by E. Stern, vol. 3, 1098–1102. Jerusalem: Carta, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; to carry the insignia of a [[rooster]] "in fighting stance" for spiritual purposes based on Proverbs 30, with similar illustrations of "cocks in fighting stance"&lt;ref&gt;Symbols and Emblems of Early and Mediaeval Christian Art by Louisa Twining&amp;nbsp;— page 188 - published 1885&lt;/ref&gt; found within the [[Vivian Bible]]. In [[Jesus]]' time domestic poultry, introduced from India through [[Persia]], had become common, and their well-known habits gave rise to familiar expressions, and afforded good and easy illustrations ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 13:35; 14:30, etc.). Jesus Christ compared His care for [[Jerusalem]] to that of a hen for her brood, or more accurately an [[ornis]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://concordances.org/greek/3733.htm] Strong's Concordance&amp;nbsp;– 3733. ornis: a bird, specifically a rooster or hen&lt;/ref&gt; a bird, specifically a rooster or hen.  The three times the word 'cock' appears in the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] it is owing to a misinterpretation of the primitive text, according to some, but to others in the context of a religious instilling vessel of "a girt one of the loins" ([[Young's Literal Translation]]) that which is "stately in his stride" and "move with stately bearing" within the [[Book of Proverbs]] 30:29–31, Saʻadiah ben Yosef Gaon ([[Saadia Gaon]]) identifies the definitive trait of "a cock girded about the loins" within Proverbs 30:31(DV) as "the honesty of their behavior and their success",&lt;ref&gt;PROVERBS 10-31, Volume 18&amp;nbsp;– Michael V. Fox&amp;nbsp;– Yale University Press 2009&amp;nbsp;– 704 pages&lt;/ref&gt; identifying a spiritual purpose of a religious vessel within that religious and spiritual instilling schema.
**(1) [[Book of Job|Job]], xxxviii, 36, the word sékhwi means soul, heart: "Who hath put wisdom in the [[Heart (symbol)|heart]] of man? and who gave his [[Soul#Christian beliefs|soul]] understanding?", but also "Sekvi means '[[rooster]]' according to the Sages"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sWMIl5Cu6cEC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=Rashi+comments+on+Job+38:36:+%22Sekvi+means+'rooster'+according+to+the+Sages+but+there+are+others+who+say+that+it+means+'heart'%22.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rI91Gs1P6t&amp;sig=aamFMfzgPzc37-7c7QmRELtGljE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UWcgUOaUIIGs9ASYqoDQCw&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Rashi%20comments%20on%20Job%2038%3A36%3A%20%22Sekvi%20means%20'rooster'%20according%20to%20the%20Sages%20but%20there%20are%20others%20who%20say%20that%20it%20means%20'heart'%22.&amp;f=false] The Three Blessings:Boundaries, Censorship, and Identity in Jewish Liturgy:

**(2) Prov., xxx, 31, zãrzîr should be translated as "[[hero]]" according to some, but to others as "a cock girded about the loins" or "a girt one of the loins"(Young's Literal Translation), "which most of the old translations and Rabbis understood to be a [[fighting cock]]",.&lt;ref&gt;Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament HALOT 1:281 s.v. zarzir&lt;/ref&gt;
**(3) Is., xxii, 17, where the word gébhér, great, strong man, has been rendered according to some rabbinical conceptions, but also the Hebrew word gever was used to mean a "rooster" in addition to the meaning of "man, strong man".
*[[Cockatrice]]&amp;nbsp;— A fabulous serpent supposed to be produced from a cock's egg brooded by a serpent; it was alleged that its hissing would drive away all other serpents, and that its breath, even its look, was fatal. The word is used in [[Authorized Version|A.V.]] as the regular equivalent for Hebrew, çíphe'ônî.
*[[Colt (horse)|Colt]]&amp;nbsp;— See ASS' COLT (sup.).
*[[Rock hyrax|Coney]]&amp;nbsp;— See Cherogrillus (sup.).
*[[Coral]], Hebrew, rãmôth, should probably be substituted, [[Book of Job|Job]], xxviii, 18, for "eminent things", and Ezech., xxvii, 16, for "silk" in the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] The coral dealt with at Tyre was that of the [[Red Sea]] or even of the [[Indian Ocean]]; coral seems to have been scarcely known among the Jews.
*[[Cormorant]] ([[Leviticus]] 11:17; [[Deuteronomy]] 14:17), very frequently met with on the coasts, rivers, and lakes of Israel, probably corresponds to the shãlãk of the Hebrew, although this name, which means "the plunger", might be applied to some other plunging bird.
*[[Cow]]&amp;nbsp;— See CATTLE (sup.).
*[[crane (bird)|Crane]] ([[Grus (genus)|grus]] cinerea)&amp;nbsp;— The word does not occur in [[Douai Bible|D.V.]], but seems the best translation of Hebrew, 'ãghûr, read in two passages: Is., xxxviii, 14, and Jer., viii, 7, where its loud voice and migratory instincts are alluded to. There is little doubt that the two above indicated places of [[Douai Bible|D.V.]], where we read "[[Swallow (bird)|swallow]]", should be corrected.
*[[Cricket (insect)|Cricket]], a good translation for Hebr., çelãçál, "chirping", which besides the feature suggested by the etymology, is described Deut., xxviii, 42, as a voracious insect. See BLAST (sup.).
*[[Crocodile]]&amp;nbsp;— We do not read this word in any other place than Lev., xi, 29 ([[Douai Bible|D.V.]]), where it corresponds to the Hebrew, çãb; the animal is, nevertheless, oftener spoken of in the Holy Books under cover of several metaphors: ráhâb, "the proud" ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 51:9); tánnîn, "the stretcher" ([[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 29:3); líweyãthãn (leviathan) [Ps. lxxiii (Hebr., lxxiv), 14; [[Book of Job|Job]], xl, 20, xli, 25]. See DRAGON (inf.). The crocodile (crocodilus vulgaris) is still found in great numbers, not only in the upper [[Nile]], but also in Israel. A remarkable description of the crocodile has been drawn by the author of the [[Book of Job]]. He depicts the difficulty of capturing, snaring, or taming him, his vast size, his impenetrable scales, his flashing eyes, his snorting, and his immense strength. Dreadful as he is, the crocodile was very early regarded and worshipped as a deity by the Egyptians. He is, in the Bible, the emblem of the people of Egypt and their [[Pharaoh]], sometimes even of all Israel's foes.
*[[Cuckoo]], according to some, would be the bird called in Hebrew shâhâph ([[Leviticus]] 11:16; [[Deuteronomy]] 14:15), and there reckoned among the unclean birds. Two species, the cuculus canorus, and the oxylophus glandarius live in the Holy Land; however there is little probability that the cuckoo is intended in the mentioned passages, where we should perhaps see the shear-water and the various species of sea-gulls.

==D==
*[[Daboia zanthina]], See Basilisk (sup.).
*[[Cherogrillus|Daman]]&amp;nbsp;— See Cherogrillus (sup.).
*[[Deer]]&amp;nbsp;— (Hebr., 'áyyãl). Its name is frequently read in the Scriptures, and its habits have afforded many allusions or comparisons, which fact supposes that the deer was not rare in Israel. Its handsome form, its swiftness, its shyness, the love of the roe for her fawns, are alluded to; it seems from Prov., v, 19 and some other indirect indications that the words 'áyyãl and 'áyyãlah (deer and hind) were terms of endearment most familiar between lovers.
*[[Demons]] ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 34:14)&amp;nbsp;— So does [[Douai Bible|D.V.]], translate çíyyîm; it is certainly a mistake. The word at issue is generally believed to refer to the [[hyena]] (hyœna striata), still found everywhere in caves and tombs
*[[Dispas]]&amp;nbsp;— The [[Douai Bible|D.V.]], following the [[Vulgate]] ([[Deuteronomy]] 8:15) thereby means a serpent whose bite causes a mortal thirst; but this interpretation seems to come from a misunderstanding suggested by the [[Septuagint]]; the original writer most likely intended there to mean "drought", as the [[Authorized Version|A.V.]] rightly puts it, and not any kind of serpent.
*[[Dog]]&amp;nbsp;— The dog in the East does not enjoy the companionship and friendship of man as in the western countries. Its instinct has been cultivated only insofar as the protecting of the flocks and camps against wild animals is concerned. In the towns and villages it roams in the streets and places, of which it is the ordinary scavenger; packs of dogs in a half-wild state are met with in the cities and are not infrequently dangerous for men. For this reason the dog has always been, and is still looked upon with loathing and aversion, as filthy and unclean. With a very few exceptions, whenever the dog is spoken of in the Bible (where it is mentioned over 40 times), it is with contempt, to remark either its voracious instincts, or its fierceness, or its loathsomeness; it was regarded as the emblem of [[lust]], and of uncleanness in general. As some [[Muslim]]s, to the present day, term Christians "dogs",{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} so did the [[Jew]]s of old apply that infamous name to [[Gentile]]s.  A [[greyhound]] is mentioned in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 30:31.
*[[Dove]] (Hebr., yônah)&amp;nbsp;— Though distinguishing it from tôr, the [[Streptopelia|turtle-dove]], the Jews were perfectly aware of their natural affinity and speak of them together. The dove is mentioned in the Bible oftener than any other bird (over 50 times); this comes both from the great number of doves flocking in Israel, and of the favour they enjoy among the people. The dove is first spoken of in the record of the [[Genesis flood narrative|flood]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 8:8–12); later on we see that [[Abraham]] offered up some in sacrifice, which would indicate that the dove was very early domesticated. In fact several allusions are made to dove-cotes, with their "windows" or latticed openings. But in olden times as well as now, besides the legions of pigeons that swarm around the villages, there were many more rock-doves, "doves of the valleys", as they are occasionally termed ([[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 7:16; [[Song of Solomon|Song of Songs]] 2:14; [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 48:28), that filled the echoes of the mountain gorges with the rustling of their wings. The metallic lustre of their plumage, the swiftness of their flight, their habit of sweeping around in flocks, their plaintive coo, are often alluded to by the different sacred writers. The dark eye of the dove, encircled by a line of bright red skin, is also mentioned; its gentleness and innocence made it the type of trust and love, and, most naturally, its name was one of the most familiar terms of endearment. [[Jesus]] spoke of the dove as a symbol of simplicity; the sum of its perfections made it a fitting emblem for the [[Holy Spirit]].
*[[Dragon]], a word frequently found in the translations of the Bible as substitute, so it seems, for other names of animals that the translators were unable to identify. It stands indeed for several Hebrew names:
**(1) thán ([[Book of Job|Job]] 30:29; [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 34:13; 35:7; 43:20; [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 9:11; 10:22; 14:6; 49:33; 51:37; [[Book of Micah|Micah]] 1:8; [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]] 1:3), unquestionably meaning a denizen of desolate places, and generally identified with the [[jackal]];
**(2) tánnîm, in a few passages with the sense of [[Snake|serpent]] [Deut., xxxii, 33; Ps., xc (Hebr., xci), 13; Dan., xiv, 22-27], in others most likely signifying the [[crocodile]] [Ps., lxxiii (Hebr., lxxiv), 13; Is., li, 9; Ezech., xxix, 3], or even a sea-monster ([[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 32:2), such as a [[whale]], [[porpoise]], or [[dugong]], as rightly translated in Lam., iv, 3, and as probably intended in Ps., cxlviii, 7;
**(3) líweyãthãn (leviathan), meaning both the crocodile [Ps., lxxiii (Hebr., lxxiv), 14] and sea-monster [Ps. ciii (Hebr., civ), 26];
**(4) çiyyim (Psalm 73:14; [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 1:39), which possibly means the hyena.
:Other places, such as Esth., x, 7; xi, 6; Ecclus., xxv, 23, can be neither traced back to a Hebrew original, nor identified with sufficient probability. The author of the [[Book of Revelation|Apocalypse]] repeatedly makes mention of the dragon, by which he means "the old serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, who seduceth the whole world" (Revelation 12:9, etc.). Of the fabulous dragon fancied by the ancients, represented as a monstrous winged serpent with a crested head and enormous claws, and regarded as very powerful and ferocious, no mention is found in the Bible. The word dragon, consequently, should really be removed from Bibles, except perhaps from Is., xiv, 29 and xxx, 6, where the draco fimbriatus is possibly spoken of. See BASILISK, 4 (sup.).

*[[Dromedary]]&amp;nbsp;— The word so rendered, Is., lx, 6, signifies rather a swift and finely bred camel.
*[[Dugong]]&amp;nbsp;— See BADGER (sup.).

==E==
*[[Eagle]] — So is generally rendered the Hebrew, néshér, but there is a doubt as to whether the eagle or some kind of [[vulture]] is intended. It seems even probable that the Hebrews did not distinguish very carefully these different large [[birds of prey]], and that all are spoken of as though they were of one kind. Anyway, four species of eagles are known to live in Israel: aquila chrysœtos, aquila nœvia, aquila heliaca, and circœtos gallicus. Many allusions are made to the eagle in the Bible: its inhabiting the dizziest cliffs for nesting, its keen sight, its habit of congregating to feed on the slain, its swiftness, its longevity, its remarkable care in training its young, are often referred to (see in particular [[Book of Job|Job]] 39:27-30). When the relations of [[Land of Israel|Israel]] with their neighbours became more frequent, the eagle became, under the pen of the Jewish prophets and poets, an emblem first of the [[Assyria]]n, then of the [[Babylonia]]n, and finally of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] kings.
*[[Elephant]]&amp;nbsp;— We learn from Assyrian inscriptions that before the Hebrews settled in [[Syria]], there existed elephants in that country, and [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] tells us about his exploits in elephant hunting. We do not read, however, of elephants in the Bible until the [[Maccabees|Machabean]] times. True, [[Books of Kings|III Kings]] speaks of ivory, or "[elephants'] teeth", as the Hebrew text puts it, yet not as indigenous, but as imported from [[Ophir]]. In the post-exilian times, especially in the books of the Machabees, elephants are frequently mentioned; they were an important element in the armies of the Seleucides. These animals were imported either from India or from Africa.
*[[Ericus]], a Latin name of the [[hedgehog]], preserved in the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] as a translation of the Hebrew word qíppôdh ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 14:23; 34:11; [[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]] 2:14, the word urchin has been used) and qîppôz ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 34:15). The above identification of the qíppôdh is based both on the Greek rendering and the analogy between this Hebrew word and the [[Talmudic]] (qúppádh), [[Syriac language|Syriac]] (qufdô'), Arabic (qúnfúd) and [[Ethiopia]]n (qinfz) names of the hedgehog. Several scholars, however, discard this identification, because the hedgehog, contrary to the qíppôdh, lives neither in marshes nor ruins, and has no voice. The [[bittern]] meets all the requirements of the texts where the qíppôdh is mentioned. It should be noticed nevertheless that hedgehogs are far from rare in Israel. As to the qîppôz of Is., xxxiv, 15, read qíppôdh by some Hebrew Manuscripts, and interpreted accordingly by the [[Septuagint]], [[Vulgate]] and the versions derived therefrom, its identity is a much discussed question. Some, arguing from the authorities just referred to, confound it with the qíppôdh, whereas others deem it to be the arrow-snake; but besides that no such animal as arrow-snake is known to naturalists, the context seems to call for a bird.
*[[Sheep|Ewe]]&amp;nbsp;— In [[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]], six names at least, with their feminines, express the different stages of development of the [[sheep]]. Its domestication goes back to the night of time, so that the early traditions enshrined in the Bible speak of the first men as [[shepherd]]s. Whatever may be thought of this point, it is out of question that from the dawn of historical times down to our own, flocks have constituted the staple of the riches of the land. The ewe of Israel is generally the [[ovis]] laticaudata, the habits of which, resembling those of all other species of sheep, are too well known to be here dwelt upon. Let it suffice to notice that scores of allusions are made in the Holy Books to these habits as well as to the different details of the pastoral life.

==F==
*[[Falcon]]&amp;nbsp;— See HAWK (inf.).
*[[Fallow deer|Fallow-deer]] (''Cervus dama'' or ''Dama vulgaris''). The fallow-deer is scarce in the Holy Land and found only north of [[Mount Tabor, Israel|Mount Thabor]]. If it is mentioned at all in the Bible, it is probably ranked among the deer.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}
*[[Faun]]&amp;nbsp;— An equivalent in [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] ([[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 1:39), after [[St. Jerome]], for Hebrew, 'íyyîm. St. Jerome explains that they were wild beings, denizens of deserts and woods, with a hooked nose, a horned forehead, and goat feet. He translated the Hebrew as fig-faun, adding to the original the adjective ficarii, possibly following in this the pagan idea which, supposing that [[ficus|fig]]s [[Aphrodisiac|incline to lust]], regarded fig-groves a well fitted abode for fauns. The same Hebrew word is rendered in Is., xiii, 22 as ''[[owl]]s'', and in Is., xxxiv, 14, as ''[[monster]]s'', which shows a great perplexity on the part of the translators. The true meaning, being "howlers", seems to point out the [[jackal]], called the "howler" by the Arabs.
*[[Fawn]] ([[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 5:19), for Hebrew, yá'alah, feminine of yã'el which should be regularly, as it is in several passages, rendered by wild goat (ibex syriacus{{clarify|date=September 2016}}). See GOAT, WILD (inf.).
*[[Fish]]&amp;nbsp;— Fish are mentioned extensively in the Bible, although no particular species is named. Fishermen are mentioned in both Old and New Testaments, including several of Jesus' followers. The biblical fish category includes marine mammals. ("Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones..." Lamentations 4:3 A.V. &amp; D.V.) Jonah's fish: According to the Book of Jonah, a "great fish" swallowed the prophet Jonah (Jonah 1:17 A.V.), and he was in its belly for three days, before being vomited up. Matthew 12:40 refers to it as a whale.&lt;ref name=multi&gt;[http://studybible.info/compare/Matthew%2012:40 Matthew 12:40 (multiple versions)] As early as the [[Wessex Gospels]] of 990 CE the Greek "κήτους" of Matthew 12:40 was translated as "hwæle" (whale). The Greek [[Septuagint]] translated the fish of [http://studybible.info/compare/Jonah%201:17 Jonah 1:17] as "κήτους".&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Flea]], spoken of I K., xxiv, 15; xxvi, 20, as the most insignificant cause of trouble that may befall a man.
*[[Herd|Flock]]&amp;nbsp;— The flocks of Israel include generally both sheep and goats: "The sheep eat only the fine herbage, whereas the goats browse on what the sheep refuse. They pasture and travel together in parallel columns, but seldom intermingle more closely, and at night they always classify themselves. The goats are for the most part black, the sheep white, [[Jacob (sheep)|dappled or piebald]], forming a very marked contrast..." (Tristram). The [[shepherd]] usually leads the flock, calling the sheep by their names from time to time; in his footsteps follows an old he-[[goat]], whose stately bearing affords to the natives matter for several comparisons; the [[Arabs]], indeed to this day, call a man of stately mien a "he-goat". The shepherd at sunset waters his flock, folds them ordinarily in some of the many caves found on every hillside, and with trained dogs guards them at night.
*[[Fly]]&amp;nbsp;— Two Hebrew words are thus translated:
**(1) 'ãrõbh is the name of the Egyptian fly of the [[Plagues of Egypt|fourth plague]]; this name, a collective one, though translated as dog-fly in the Septuagint, seems to signify all kinds of flies. Flies are at all times an almost insufferable nuisance; the common house-fly, with the [[gnat]], vexes men, while gad-flies of every description tsetse, œstru, hippoboscida, tabanus marocanus, etc., infest animals.
**(2) Zebhûbh is likewise the collective name of the Israeli fly, but more specifically of the gad-fly.
:Though a trifle less annoying than in Egypt, flies were, however, deemed a plague severe enough in Israel to induce the natives to have recourse to the power of a special god, Bá'ál-zebhûbh, the master of the flies, that they and their cattle be protected against that scourge.

*[[Fowl]]&amp;nbsp;— This word which, in its most general sense, applies to anything that flies in the air ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:20, 21), including the "bat" and "flying creeping things" (Leviticus 11:19-23 A.V.), and which frequently occurs in the Bible with this meaning, is also sometimes used in a narrower sense, as, for instance, III K., iv, 23, where it stands for all fatted birds that may be reckoned among the delicacies of a king's table; so likewise Gen., xv, 11 and Is., xviii, 6, where it means birds of prey in general. In this latter signification allusions are made to their habit of perching on bare or dead trees, or of flocking together in great numbers.
*[[Fox]]&amp;nbsp;— Thus is usually rendered the Hebrew, shû'ãl, which signifies both fox and [[jackal]], even the latter more often than the former. The fox, however, was well known by the ancient [[Hebrews]], and its cunning was as proverbial among them as among us ([[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 13:4; [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 13:32).
*[[Frog]]&amp;nbsp;— Though not rare in Israel, this word is only mentioned in the Old Testament in connection with the second [[Plagues of Egypt|plague of Egypt]]. Two species of frogs are known to live in the [[Holy Land]]: the [[rana esculenta]], or common edible frog, and the [[European tree frog|hyla arborea]], or green tree-frog. The former throngs wherever there is water. In Apoc., xvi, 13, the frog is the emblem of unclean spirits.

==G==
*[[Gazelle]] (Hebr., çebî, i. e. beauty) has been known at all times as one of the most graceful of all animals. Several species still exist in Israel. Its different characteristics, its beauty of form, its swiftness, its timidity, the splendour and meekness of its eye, are in the present time, as well as during the age of the Old Testament writers, the subjects of many comparisons. However, the name of the gazelle is scarcely, if at all, to be found in the Bible; in its stead we read roe, hart, or deer. Like a few other names of graceful and timid animals, the word gazelle has always been in the East a term of endearment in love. It was also a woman's favourite name (1 [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 8:9; 2 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 12:1; 2 [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 24:1; [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 9:36).
*[[Gecko]]&amp;nbsp;— Probable translation of the 'anãqah of the Hebrews, generally rendered in our versions by shrew-mouse, for which it seems it should be substituted. The gecko, ptyodactylus gecko of the naturalists, is common in Israel.
*[[Gier-eagle]]&amp;nbsp;— So does [[Authorized Version|A.V.]] render the Hebrew, rãhãm ([[Leviticus]] 11:18) or rãhãmah ([[Deuteronomy]] 14:17). By the gier-eagle, the Egyptian vulture ([[neophron percnopterus]]), or Pharao's hen, is generally believed to be signified. However, whether this bird should be really recognized in the Hebrew, rãhãm, is not easy to decide; for while, on the one hand, the resemblance of the Arabic name for the Egyptian vulture with the Hebrew word rãhãm seems fairly to support the identification, the mention of the rãhãm in a list of wading birds, on the other hand, casts a serious doubt on its correctness.
*[[Giraffe]]&amp;nbsp;— See Camelopardalus (sup.). Probably the תחשׁ (taḥash). (Numbers 4:5-15). Mistranslated as badger or dolphin.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
*[[Gnat]]&amp;nbsp;— The same insect called sciniph in Ex., viii, 16, 17 and Ps. civ (Hebr., cv), 31, and known under the familiar name of [[mosquito]], ''[[Culex pipiens]]'', is taken in the New Testament as an example of a trifle.
*[[Goat]]&amp;nbsp;— Though the sacred writers spoke of the ewe more frequently than of the goat, yet with the latter they were very well acquainted. It was indeed, especially in the hilly regions east of the [[Jordan River|Jordan]], an important item in the wealth of the [[Israelites]]. The goat of Israel, particularly the [[Capra (genus)|capra]] membrica, affords numerous illustrations and allusions, Its remarkably long ears are referred to by [[Book of Amos|Amos]], iii, 12; its glossy dark hair furnishes a graphic comparison to the author of Cant., iv, 1; vi, 4; this hair was woven into a strong cloth; the skin tanned with the hair on served to make bottles for milk, wine, oil, water, etc. The kid was an almost essential part of a feast. The goat is mentioned in Dan., viii, 5, as the symbol of the [[Macedonian dynasty|Macedonian empire]]. The grand Gospel scene of the separation of the just and the wicked on the [[Last Judgment|last day]] is borrowed from the customs of the shepherds in the East.
*[[Wild goat|Goat, wild]], [[Book of Job|Job]], xxxix, 1; I K., xxiv, 3, where it is an equivalent for yã' él, translated in Ps., ciii (Hebr., Civ), 18, as hart and in Prov., v, 19, as fawn, is most probably the [[ibex]] syriacus, a denizen of the rocky summits [Ps. ciii (Hebr., civ), 18]. It was regarded as a model of grace ([[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 5:19), and its name, Jahel, Jahala, was frequently given to persons ([[Book of Judges|Judges]] 5:6; [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] 2:56, etc.).
*[[Grasshopper]], is probably the best rendering for the Hebrew, hãgãb [Lev., xi, 22; Num., xiii, 34 (Hebrews 13:33); Is., xl, 22; Eccles., xii, 5, etc.], as in the [[Authorized Version|A.V.]], if the Hebrew word be interpreted "hopper" as [[:de:Karl August Credner]] suggests; the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] uses the word [[locust]]. The grasshopper is one of the smaller species of the locust tribe.
*[[Griffon]]&amp;nbsp;— So [[Douai Bible|D.V.]], Lev., xi, 13 (whereas [[Deuteronomy]] 14:12, we read "grype") translates the Hebrew, pérés, the "breaker" whereby the [[lammergeyer]] or bearded vulture, gypœtus barbatus, the largest and most magnificent of the birds of prey is probably intended. The opinion that the Bible here speaks of the fabulous griffon, i.e. a monster begotten from a lion and an eagle, and characterized by the beak, neck, and wings of an eagle and the legs and rump of a lion, is based only on a misinterpretation of the word.
*[[Griffon vulture]], a probable translation in several cases of the Hebrew, néshér, regularly rendered by [[eagle]]. This most majestic bird (''[[Gyps fulvus]]''), the type, as it seems, of the eagle-headed figures of [[Assyria]]n sculpture, is most likely referred to in Mich., i, 16, on account of its bare neck and head.
*[[Grype]], Deut., xiv, 12. See Griffon (sup.).

==H==
*[[Asp (reptile)|Haje]]&amp;nbsp;— See Asp (sup.)
*[[Hare]]&amp;nbsp;— Mentioned Lev., xi, 6; Deut., xiv, 7, in the list of the [[unclean animals|unclean]] quadrupeds. Several subspecies of the [[European hare]] and the [[Cape hare]] live in Israel: ''[[Lepus europaeus syriacus]]'' in the north; ''[[Lepus europaeus judeae]]'' in the south and the Jordan valley, together with ''[[Lepus capensis sinaiticus]]'', ''[[Lepus capensis aegyptius]]'' and ''[[Lepus capensis isabellinus]]'', The statement of the Bible that the hare "cheweth the cud" is a classical difficulty. It should be noticed that this is not the reason why the hare is reckoned among the unclean animals; but the cause thereof should be sought for in the fact that though it chews the cud, which certainly it appears to do, it does not divide the hoof.
*[[Hart (animal)|Hart]] and [[Red deer|hind]]&amp;nbsp;— Either the [[fallow-deer]], still occasionally found in the [[Holy Land]], or the [[red deer]], now extinct, or the [[deer]] generally. It has afforded many illustrations to time biblical writers and poets, especially by its fleetness ([[Song of Solomon|Song of Songs]] 2:9; [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 35:6), its sure-footedness [Ps. xvii (Hebr., xviii), 34; Hab., iii, 19], its affection ([[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 5:19), and its habit of hiding its young ([[Book of Job|Job]] 39:1).
*[[Hawk]] (Hebr., neç) is, in the Scriptures, a general denomination including, with the [[falcon]], all the smaller [[birds of prey]], the [[kestrel]], [[Merlin (bird)|merlin]], [[sparrowhawk]], [[Hobby (bird)|hobby]], and others, most common in Israel.
*[[Nighthawk|Night hawk]], [[Authorized Version|A.V.]] for Hebrew, táhmãs, more exactly translated in [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] as owl; some bird of the latter kind is indeed undoubtedly intended, probably the [[barn owl]] ([[Strix (genus)|strix]] flammea).
*[[Eurasian sparrowhawk|Sparrow hawk]] (''Accipiter nisus)'', one of the hawks of Israel, so common that it might be regarded, in reference to the Bible, as the hawk par excellence.
*[[Hedgehog]]&amp;nbsp;— See Ericius (sup.).
*[[Chicken|Hen]], See COCK (sup.).
*[[Heron]]&amp;nbsp;— Mentioned Lev., xi, 19, in the list of [[unclean animals|unclean birds]], but probably in the wrong place in the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]]; heron, indeed, should be substituted for charadrion, whereas in the same verse it stands for [[stork]], as the [[Authorized Version|A.V.]] correctly states it.
*[[Red deer|Hind]]&amp;nbsp;— See HART. (sup.).
*[[Hippopotamus]]&amp;nbsp;— See BEHEMOTH (sup.).
*[[Hobby (bird)|Hobby]] (falco subbuteo). See HAWK (sup.).
*[[Hoopoe]]&amp;nbsp;— See HOUP (inf.).
*[[Hornet]] (Hebr., çíre'ah; vespa crabro)&amp;nbsp;— One of the largest and most pugnacious [[wasps]]; when disturbed they attack [[cattle]] and [[horse]]s; their sting is very severe, capable not only of driving men and cattle to [[Insanity|madness]], but even of killing them ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 23:28; [[Deuteronomy]] 7:20; [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 24:12).
*[[Horse]]&amp;nbsp;— The horse is never mentioned in Scripture in connection with the patriarchs; the first time the Bible speaks of it, it is in reference to the Egyptian army pursuing the Hebrews, During the epoch of the conquest and of [[Book of Judges|Judges]], we hear of horses only with the Chanaanean troops, and later on with the [[Philistines]], The hilly country inhabited by the [[Israelites]] was not favourable to the use of the horse; this is the reason why the Bible speaks of horses only in connection with war. [[David]] and [[Solomon]] established a [[cavalry]] and [[chariot]] force; but even this, used exclusively for wars of conquest, seems to have been looked upon as a dangerous temptation to kings, for the [[Deuteronomy]] legislation forbids them to multiply horses for themselves. The grand description of the [[war horse]] in [[Book of Job|Job]] is classical; it will be noticed, however, that its praises are more for the strength than for the swiftness of the horse. The prophet [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zacharias]] depicts (ix, 10) the [[Messianic age]] as one in which no hostilities will be heard of; then all warlike apparel being done away with, the horse will serve only for peaceful use.
*[[Houp]] ([[Leviticus]] 11:19; [[Deuteronomy]] 14:18)&amp;nbsp;— The analogy of the Hebrew with [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] for the name of this bird makes the identification doubtless, although some, after the example of the [[Authorized Version|A.V.]], see in the Hebrew dûkhîpháth, the [[lapwing]]. The Egyptians worshipped the houp and made it the emblem of [[Horus]].
*[[Striped hyena]]&amp;nbsp;— This word is not to be found in any of the English translations of the Bible; it occurs twice in the [[Septuagint]], Jer., xii, 9, and Ecclus., xiii, 22, being in both places the rendering for the Hebrew name çãbhûá. The hyenas are very numerous in the Holy Land, where they are most active scavengers; they feed upon dead bodies, and sometimes dig the tombs open to get at the corpses therein buried. Two Hebrew names are supposed to designate the hyena:
**(1) çãbhûá'. This word, which has been interpreted "speckled bird", Jer., xii, 9, by modern translators following the [[Vulgate]], has been rendered by "holy man", Ecclus., xiii, 22. Despite the authorities that favour the above-mentioned translation of Jer., xii, 9, the consistency of the Septuagint on the one hand, and on the other the parallelism in the latter passage, in addition to the analogy with the [[Arabic]] and rabbinical [[Hebrew]] names for the hyena, fairly support the identification of the çãbhûá' with this animal.
**(2) çíyyím, rendered in divers manners in different places: wild beasts, Is., xiii, 21; demons, Is., xxxiv, 14; dragons, Ps. lxxiii (hebr., lxxiv), 14; Jer., 1, 39.

==I==
*[[Ibex]]&amp;nbsp;— See GOAT, WILD (sup.).
*[[Ibis]]&amp;nbsp;— The word occurs twice in the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] ([[Leviticus]] 11:17; [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 34:11) as an equivalent for yánshûph; some good authorities, however, though the yánshûph is mentioned among wading birds, do not admit the above identification and think that the Egyptian eagle-owl (''[[Bubo ascalaphus]]''), which they term great owl, is spoken of. The ibis was worshipped by the Egyptians as the emblem of [[Thot]].
*[[Egyptian mongoose|Ichneumon]]&amp;nbsp;— See WEASEL (inf.).
*[[Irchin]]&amp;nbsp;— [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] Ps. ciii, 18. See CHEROGRILLUS (sup.).

==J==
*[[Jackal]]&amp;nbsp;— Frequently alluded to in Bible, though the name is read neither in the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] nor in any of the western translations, probably because the animal, however common in Africa and south-western Asia is unknown in European countries. The name regularly substituted for jackal is [[fox]]. The jackal seems to be designated in Hebrew by three different names: shû'ãl, "the digger"; 'íyyîm, "the howlers"; and tãn, "the stretcher", although we are unable to state the differences marked by these three names, numerous references may be found throughout the Bible to the jackal's howlings and gregarious habits. The most likely species mentioned is the [[golden jackal]], which is the only jackal to live in the Middle East.
*[[Jerboa]]&amp;nbsp;— This little animal, at least four species of which abide in [[Syria]], is nowhere nominally mentioned in the Bible; it must, nevertheless, very probably be reckoned among the [[unclean animals]] indicated under the general name of [[mouse]].

==K==
*[[Kestrel]]&amp;nbsp;— A slender [[falcon]], most likely one of the species intended by Lev., xi, 16, for it is very common in [[Israel]]. The remark of [[Book of Job|Job]], xxxix, 26, strikingly points out the tinnulus cenchris, one of the Israeli kestrels.
*[[goat|Kid]]&amp;nbsp;— See GOAT. (sup.).
*Kind — See SPECIES.
*[[Cattle|Kine]]&amp;nbsp;— See CATTLE (sup.).
*[[Kite (bird)|Kite]]&amp;nbsp;— As suggested by the analogy with the Arabic, the black kite ([[milvus]] nigrans) is probably meant by Hebr. dã'ah or dáyyah ([[Leviticus]] 11:14; [[Deuteronomy]] 14:13; [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 34:15), interpreted kite in the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]]; it is one of the most common of the scavenger [[birds of prey]] of the country, and for this reason, is carefully protected by the villagers. Other kinds of kites, in particular the milvus regalis, are common in Israel.

==L==
*[[domestic sheep|Lamb]]&amp;nbsp;— The [[Lamb of God|Paschal Lamb]] was both a commemoration of the deliverance from the bondage in Egypt, and a prophetic figure of the [[Son of God]] sacrificed to free His people from their slavery to sin and death. See EWE. (sup.).
*[[Lamia (mythology)|Lamia]] ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 34:14)&amp;nbsp;— Is a translation of Hebrew, lîlîth; according to the old popular legends, the lamia was a feminine bloodthirsty monster, devouring men and children. In the above cited place, some kind of [[owl]], either the [[screech owl|screech]] or the [[Owl|hooting owl]], is very probably meant.
*[[Lammergeyer]] (gypœtus barbatus) very likely signified by the Hebrew, pérés, translated as [[griffon]] in [[Douai Bible|D.V.]]
*[[Larus]]&amp;nbsp;— Lev., xi; 16; Deut., xiv, 15. See CUCKOO (sup.).
*[[Leech|Horse-leech]] ([[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 30:15)&amp;nbsp;— Both the [[medicinal leech]] and the horse-leech are frequently found in the streams, pools, and wells; they often attach themselves to the inside of the lips and nostrils of drinking animals, thereby causing them much pain.
*[[Leopard]]&amp;nbsp;— Under this name come a certain number of [[carnivorous]] animals more or less resembling the real leopard ([[felis]] [[leopardus]]), namely felis jubata, felis [[lynx]], felis uncia, etc., all formerly numerous throughout Israel, and even now occasionally found, especially in the woody districts. The leopard is taken by the biblical writers as a type of cunning ([[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 5:6; [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] 13:7), of fierceness, of a conqueror's sudden swoop (Dan., vii, 6; Hab., i, 8). Its habit of lying in wait by a well or a village is repeatedly alluded to.
*[[Leviathan]]&amp;nbsp;— The word Leviathan (Hebrew, líweyãthãn), which occurs six times in the Hebrew Bible, seems to have puzzled not a little all ancient translators. The [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] has kept this name, [[Book of Job|Job]], iii, 8; xl, 20; Is., xxvii, 1; it is rendered by dragon Ps. lxxiii (Hebr., lxxiv), 14, and ciii (Hebr., civ), 26; The word leviathan means:
**(2) a sea-monster [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 27:1);Job 41
*[[Lion]]&amp;nbsp;— Now extinct in [[Israel]] and in the surrounding countries, the lion was common there during the [[Old Testament]] times; hence the great number of words in the Hebrew language to signify it; under one or another of these names it is mentioned 130 times in the Scriptures, as the classical symbol of strength, power, courage, dignity, ferocity. Very likely as the type of power, it became the ensign of the tribe of [[Judah (biblical person)|Judah]]; so was it employed by [[Solomon]] in the decoration of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|temple]] and of the king's house. For the same reason, Apoc., v, 5, represents [[Jesus Christ]] as the lion of the tribe of Juda. The craft and ferocity of the lion, on the other hand, caused it to be taken as an emblem of [[Satan]] (1 Peter 5:8) and of the enemies of the truth (2 Timothy 4:17).
*[[Lizard]]&amp;nbsp;— Immense is the number of these reptiles in Israel; no less than 44 species are found there, Among those mentioned in the Bible we may cite:
**(1) The Letã'ah, general name of the lizard, applied especially to the [[common lizard]], the green lizard, the [[blindworm]], etc.;
**(2) the chõmét, or [[sand lizard]];
**(3) the çãb, or dább of the Arabs (''[[Uromastix]] spinipes'');
**(4) the kõâh, the divers kinds of [[Monitor lizard|monitor]] (psammosaurus scincus, [[hydrosaurus]] niloticus, etc.);
**(5) the 'anãqah or [[gecko]];
**(6) the semãmîth or stellio.
*[[Locust]]&amp;nbsp;— One of the worst scourges of the East, very often referred to in Bible. As many as nine Hebrew words signify either the locust in general or some species:
**(1) 'árbéh, probably the [[locusta migratoria]];
**(2) gãzãm, possibly the locust in its [[larva]] state, the palmerworm;
**(3) Gôbh, the locust in general;
**(4) chagab, most likely the [[grasshopper]];
**(5) hãsîl, "the destroyer", perhaps the locust in its hopper state, in which it is most destructive;
**(6) hárgõl, translated in the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] as ophiomachus;
**(7) yéléq, the stinging locust;
**(8) çelãçâl possibly the [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]]; and
**(9) sôl'ãm, rendered by attacus, or bald locust (probably the truxalis).
:Unlike other insects, locusts are most voracious in every stage of their existence.

*[[Louse]]&amp;nbsp;— According to some this species of [[vermin]] was one of the features of the third [[Plagues of Egypt|Egyptian plague]]. It is but too common through all eastern countries.

==M==
*[[Mildew]]&amp;nbsp;— A word occurring a certain number of times in the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] as an equivalent for Hebrew, hãsîl, which probably means a kind of [[locust]].
*[[Mole (animal)|Mole]]&amp;nbsp;— Two Hebrew words are thus rendered, The first, tînshéméth ([[Leviticus]] 11:30), would, according to good authorities, rather signify the [[chameleon]]; with the second, haphárperôth ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 2:20), some burrowing animal is undoubtedly intended, The mole of Syria is not the [[European Mole|common mole of Europe]], ''Talpa europaea'', but a [[blind mole rat]] (''Spalax typhlus''), a blind burrowing rodent.
*[[Monkey]]&amp;nbsp;— See APE (sup.).  Occurs in 1 Kings 10:22 (NKJV).
*[[Mosquito]]&amp;nbsp;— See GNAT (sup.).
*[[Moth]]&amp;nbsp;— Is in the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] besides Is., xiv, 11, where it stands for rímmah, "worms", the common rendering for two words: 'ãsh ([[Book of Job|Job]] 4:19), and sãs ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 51:8), the exact meaning of the former is uncertain, whereas by the latter the [[clothes moth]] is meant.
*[[Mouflon]]&amp;nbsp;— See CHAMOIS, CAMELOPARDALUS (sup.).
*[[Mouse]]&amp;nbsp;— This word seems to be a general one, including the various [[rat]]s, [[dormice]], [[jerboa]]s, and [[hamster]]s, about twenty-five species of which exist in the country.
*[[Mule]]&amp;nbsp;— In spite of the enactment of the Law ([[Leviticus]] 19:19), the Israelites early in the course of their history possessed mules; these animals, in a hilly region such as the [[Holy Land]], were for many purposes preferable to [[horse]]s and stronger than [[donkey|asses]]; they were employed both for domestic and warlike use.

==N==
*[[Night-hawk]] — See HAWK. (sup.).

==O==
*[[Ophiomachus]]&amp;nbsp;— See LOCUST. (sup.).
*[[Oryx]]&amp;nbsp;— See ANTELOPE (sup.).
*[[Osprey]] (Hebr., 'óznîyyah)&amp;nbsp;— The fishing eagle, which name probably signifies all the smaller [[eagle]]s.
*[[Ossifrage]]&amp;nbsp;— See LAMMERGEYER (sup.).
*[[Ostrich]]&amp;nbsp;— Still occasionally found in the southeastern deserts of [[Israel]], the ostrich, if we are to judge from the many mentions made of it, was well known among the Hebrews. The beauty of its plumage, its fleetness, its reputed stupidity, its leaving its eggs on the sand and hatching them by the sun's heat are repeatedly alluded to.
*[[Owl]]&amp;nbsp;— A generic name under which many species of [[nocturnal]] birds are designated, some having a proper name in the Hebrew, some others possessing none. Among the former we may mention the [[little owl]] (athene persica), the Egyptian [[eagle-owl]] (''[[Bubo ascalephus]]''), the great owl of some authors, called [[ibis]] in the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]], the [[Screech owl|screech]] or hooting owl, probably the lîlîth of Is., xxxiv, and the lamia of [[St. Jerome]] and the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]]; the [[barn owl]] (stryx flammea), possibly corresponding to the táhmãs of the Hebrews and rendered by [[night hawk|night-hawk]] in the [[Authorized Version|A.V.]]; and the qîppôz of Is., xxxiv, 15, as yet unidentified.
*[[Ox]]&amp;nbsp;— See CATTLE (sup.).
*Ox, wild, Is., hi, 20, probably antilope bubalis. See ANTELOPE (sup.).

==P==

*[[Palmerworm]] (Hebr., gãzãm) A general word for the [[locust]], very likely in its [[larva]] state.
*[[Partridge]]&amp;nbsp;— Although very common in the Holy Land, the partridge is mentioned only three times in the Bible: I K., xxvi, 20 alludes to chasing it on the mountains; Jer., xvii, 11, to the robbing of its eggs; Ecclus., xi, 32, to the keeping a decoy partridge. Two kinds of partridges are known to abide in the hilly resorts of Israel; the [[francolin]] inhabits the plains, and various [[sandgrouse]] are found in the deserts.
*[[Peacock]]&amp;nbsp;— The texts where it is spoken of ([[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] 10:22; 2 [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 9:21) clearly indicate that it was not indigenous to [[Israel]], but imported, probably from India.
*[[Pelican]], [[Douai Bible|D.V.]], Ps., ci (Hebr., cii), 7, for Hebr. qã'áth, in other places is rendered by [[bittern]], for which it might be advantageously substituted. Pelicans are usually found about [[marsh]]es ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 34:11), and are in the habit of sitting for hours in sandy desolate places [Ps., ci (Hebr., cii), 7; Soph., ii, 14] after they have gorged.
*[[phoenix (mythology)|Phœnix]] or [[Chol (bible)|chol]] might possibly be read instead of palmtree (Hebr. hôl) in [[Book of Job|Job]], xxix, 18, where the belief in its immortality seems referred to; however the sense adopted by [[Douai Bible|D.V.]], after [[Vulgate]] and [[Septuagint]], should not be slighted.&lt;ref&gt;See F. Lecocq, "Y a-t-il un phénix dans la Bible ?", ''Kentron'' 30, 2014, p. 55-82.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pigeon]]&amp;nbsp;— See DOVE (sup.).
*[[Plunger]]&amp;nbsp;— See CORMORANT (sup.).
*[[Porcupine]]&amp;nbsp;— Believed by some, on account of a certain analogy of the Hebrew qîppõd with the Arabic name of this animal, to be spoken of in the Bible. See ERICIUS (sup.).
*[[Porphyrion]] is in [[Vulgate]] and [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] ([[Leviticus]] 11:18), the equivalent for the Hebrew, rãhãm, translated in the [[Septuagint]] as "[[swan]]"; in the Greek version, porphyrion stands for the Hebrew, tínshéméth, interpreted as "swan" in the Latin and English Bibles. The hypothesis that the Greek translators used a Hebrew text in which the two words rãhãm and tínshéméth stood contrariwise to their present order in the [[Masoretic Text|Massoretic text]], might account for this difference. This hypothesis is all the more probable because in Deut., xiv, 17, porphyrion seems to be the Greek translation for rãhãm. Whatever this may be, whether the porphyrion, or [[purple swamphen]] (''[[Porphyrio porphyrio]]''), or the [[Egyptian vulture]], should be identified with the rãhãm remains uncertain. See GIER-EAGLE (sup.).
*[[Pygarg]] ([[Deuteronomy]] 14:5)&amp;nbsp;— This word, a mere adaptation from the Greek, means "white-rumped", a character common to many species, though the [[Addax|antilope addax]] is possibly signified by the Hebrew word dîshõn.

==Q==
*[[Quail]]&amp;nbsp;— The description given Ex., xvi, 11-13; Num., xi, 31, 32; Ps., lxxvii (Hebr., lxxviii) 27–35, and civ (Hebr., cv), 40, the references to their countless [[Flock (birds)|flock]]s, their low flying, their habit of alighting on land in the morning, together with the analogy of the Hebrew and Arabic names, make it certain that the [[common quail]] ([[coturnix]] vulgaris) is intended.

==R==
*[[Rabbit]] ([[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 30:26)&amp;nbsp;— A coney. See CHEROGRILLUS, (sup.).
*[[Sheep|Ram]]&amp;nbsp;— See EWE, FLOCK (sup.).
*[[Raven]]&amp;nbsp;— The Bible includes under this generic name a certain number of birds having more or less resemblance with the raven, such as the [[magpie]], the [[jay]], the [[jackdaw]], the [[starling]], etc. The raven, eight species of which are found in [[Israel]], is by far the most common of all the birds of that country, where it is with [[buzzard]]s, [[vulture]]s, dogs, [[jackal]]s, and [[hyena]]s, an active scavenger. Its plumage is glossy black, and its habits are frequently alluded to in Bible, for instance feeding on carcasses, wandering for its precarious meals, picking out the eyes of the newly dropped or weakly animals, resorting to desolate places, etc. The raven, when no other food is nigh, not infrequently picks out grains freshly sown; hence its surname of seed-picker, spermologos, which, later on became a synonym for ragamuffin. This name, applied to [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] by his sceptical listeners of [[Athens]], has become, through a mistranslation, "word-sower" in our Bibles ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 17:18).
*[[Night raven]], the equivalent in Ps. ci (Hebr., cii), 7, of the Hebrew word translated in Lev., xi, 17, as [[screech owl]], seems to mean the [[Blue rock thrush|blue thrush]] (petrocynela cyanea), a well-known solitary bird of the country, which is fond of sitting alone on a roof or a rock.
*[[Rhinoceros]], Num., xxiii, 22, stands for Hebrew, re'em, and should consequently be rendered by [[aurochs]].
*[[Ring-tail harrier|Ringtail]]&amp;nbsp;— So [[Douai Bible|D.V.]], Deut., xiv, 13, translates rã'ah, possibly substituted by a scribe's error for dã'ah, and very likely meaning the [[black kite]] ([[milvus migrans]]).
*[[Rooster]], See Cock, hen. (sup.)&amp;nbsp;– alektór&lt;ref&gt;[http://concordances.org/greek/220.htm] Online Parallel Bible Project&amp;nbsp;– alektór: a rooster&lt;/ref&gt;

==S==
*[[Satyr]]&amp;nbsp;— So is the Hebrew sã'îr rendered Is., xiii, 21, and xxxiv, 14, by [[Revised Version|R.V.]] ([[Douai Bible|D.V.]]: "hairy one"). The same word in Lev., xvii, 7, and II Par., xi, 15, is translated "devils" in all English Bibles. Sã'îr usually signifies the he-[[goat]]. In the latter passages this sense is clearly inapplicable; it seems hardly applicable in the former. The writers of [[Leviticus]], and II [[Paralipomenon]] possibly intended some representation of the same description as the goat-headed figures of the Egyptian Pantheon. Concerning the sã'îr mentioned in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaias]], no satisfactory explanation has as yet been given.
*[[Scarlet (dye)|Scarlet]]&amp;nbsp;— See COCHINEAL (sup.).
*[[Sciniph]]&amp;nbsp;— See GNAT (sup.).
*[[Scorpion]]&amp;nbsp;— Very common in all hot, dry, stony places; is taken as an emblem of the wicked.
*[[Sea gull]]&amp;nbsp;— Its different kinds are probably signified by the word translated larus. See CUCKOO (sup.).
*[[Pinniped|seal]]&amp;nbsp;— See BADGER (sup.).
*[[Sea monster]], Lam., iv, 3, probably means such animals as the [[whale]], [[porpoise]], [[dugong]], etc.
*[[Snake|Serpent]]&amp;nbsp;— A generic term whereby all [[ophidia]] are designated; ten names of different species of [[snake]]s are given in the Bible.
*[[Shrew]]&amp;nbsp;— So does [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] translate the Hebr. 'anãqah, which however means rather some kind of [[lizard]], probably the [[gecko]].
*Siren, Is., xiii, 22, a translation for Hebrew tán, which, indicates an animal dwelling in ruins, and may generally be rendered by [[jackal]]. No other resemblance than a verbal one should be sought between this tán and the [[Siren (mythology)|fabulous being]], famous by its allurements, called Siren by the ancient poets.
*[[Snail]] should be read instead of wax in Ps., lvii (Hebr., lviii) 9, to translate the Hebrew shábelûl. Unlike the snails of northern climates which hibernate, those of Israel [[Aestivation|sleep in summer]]. The [[Psalmist]] alludes "to the fact that very commonly, when they have secured themselves in some chink of the rocks for their summer sleep, they are still exposed to the sun rays, which gradually evaporate and dry up the whole of the body, till the animal is shrivelled to a thread, and, as it were, melted away" (Tristram).
*[[Sparrow]]&amp;nbsp;— The Hebrew word çíppôr, found over 40 times, is a general name for all small [[passerine]] birds, of which there exist about 150 species in the [[Holy Land]].
*[[Species]]&amp;nbsp;— There is no recognition of classification by, or distinction according to, species in the Bible.
*[[Spider]]&amp;nbsp;— An [[arachnid]] living by millions in [[Israel]], where several hundred species have been distinguished. Its web affords a most popular illustration for frail and ephemeral undertakings ([[Book of Job|Job]] 8:14; [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 59:5); in three passages, however, the translators seem to have wrongly written spider for [[moth]] [Ps. xxxviii (Hebr., xxxix), 12], sigh [Ps. lxxxix (xc), 9], and pieces ([[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] 8:6).
*[[Stork]]&amp;nbsp;— The Hebrew word hasîdhah, erroneously rendered "[[heron]]" by the [[Douai Bible|Douay]] translators, Lev., xi, 19, alludes to the well-known affection of the stork for its young. Several passages have reference to this bird, its periodical migrations ([[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 8:7), its nesting in fir-trees, its black pinions stretching from its white body ([[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 5:9; [[Douai Bible|D.V.]], kite; but the stork, hasîdhah, is mentioned in the Hebrew text). Two kinds, the [[white stork|white]] and the [[black stork]], live in Israel during the winter.
*[[Swallow]]&amp;nbsp;— Two words are so rendered: derôr, "the swift flyer", which means the chimney swallow and other species akin to it [Ps. lxxxiii (Hebr., lxxxiv), 4; [[Douai Bible|D.V.]], [[turtle]]; Prov., xxvi, 2; [[Douai Bible|D.V.]], sparrow], whereas sûs or sîs may be translated as "swift", this bird being probably intended in Is., xxxviii, 14, and Jer., viii, 7.
*[[Swan]]&amp;nbsp;— Mentioned only in the list of [[unclean animals|unclean birds]] ([[Leviticus]] 11:18; [[Deuteronomy]] 14:16). The swan having always been very rare in [[Syria]], there was little need of forbidding to eat its flesh; by the Hebrew tínshéméth, some other bird might possibly be designated.
*[[Swine]]&amp;nbsp;— The most abhorred of all animals among the Jews; hence the swineherd's was the most degrading employment ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 15:15; cf. [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 8:32). Swine are very seldom kept in Israel.

==T==
*[[Tiger]], [[Book of Job|Job]], iv, 11 (Hebr., láyísh), should be "[[lion]]".
*[[Turtle]]&amp;nbsp;— See DOVE (sup.).

==U==
*[[Indian rhinoceros|Unicorn]]&amp;nbsp;— See unicornis rhinoceros (sup.).
*[[Hedgehog|Urchin]], Soph., ii, 14. See ERICIUS (sup.).

==V==
*[[Viperidae|Viper]]&amp;nbsp;— See ASP (sup.).
*[[Vulture]]&amp;nbsp;— So does [[Douai Bible|D.V.]] render the Hebrew, 'áyyah, Lev., xi, 14; Deut., xiv, 13; [[Book of Job|Job]], xxviii, 7. As has been suggested above, the text of [[Book of Job|Job]] at least, seems to allude to the kite rather than to the vulture. Several kinds of vultures are nevertheless referred to in the Bible; so, for instance, the [[bearded vulture]](gypœtus barbatus), called [[griffon]] in the [[Douai Bible|D.V.]]; the [[griffon vulture]] (gyps fulvus), the [[Egyptian vulture]] (neophron percnopterus), etc. In the biblical parlance vultures are often termed [[eagle]]s.

==W==
*[[Common moorhen|Waterhen]]&amp;nbsp;— See PORPHYRION (above).
*[[Weasel]], Lev., xi, 29, must be regarded as a general name, probably designating, besides the weasel proper, the [[wikt:polecat|polecat]] and [[ichneumon (medieval zoology)|ichneumon]], all very common in the [[Holy Land]].
*[[Whale]]&amp;nbsp;— "And God created great whales..." (Genesis 1:21 A.V.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybible.info/compare/Genesis%201:21 Genesis 1:21 (multiple versions)] The first created and largest of all creatures, the whales are notable as the only kind of creatures other than mankind expressly mentioned in the creation account.&lt;/ref&gt;) Hebrew ''Tânnîn'' can also be translated as "sea-monster"; [[porpoise]]s and [[dugong]]s were also known to the Hebrews. In Matthew 12:40, Jesus compared his own burial to Jonah's entombment in the forestomach of a whale.&lt;ref name=multi/&gt;
* Wild dogs, Ezekiel 13:4
*[[Wolf]]&amp;nbsp;— Frequently mentioned in the Scriptures as a special foe to flocks (Sirach 13:21; [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 7:15), and an emblem of treachery, ferocity, and bloodthirstiness. Wolves usually prowl at night around the [[sheepfold]]s, and, though fewer in numbers than [[jackal]]s, are much more harmful. The tribe of [[Benjamin]], owing to its warlike character, was compared to a wolf.
*[[Worm]]&amp;nbsp;— In English the translation for two Hebrew words: rímmah [Exod., xvi, 24; Is., xiv, 11; ([[Book of Job|Job]] 7:5, [[Authorized Version|A.V.]])]; and tólá' ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 16:20, etc.); these two Hebrew words are general; the former designates particularly all living organisms generated and swarming in decaying or rotten substances; the latter includes not only worms, but also such insects as [[caterpillar]]s, [[centipede]]s, etc.

{{nihongo|'''Yoshino Mountain'''|吉野山|Yoshino-yama}} is a mountain located in the town of [[Yoshino, Nara|Yoshino]] in [[Yoshino District, Nara|Yoshino District]], [[Nara Prefecture]], [[Japan]].  In 2004, it was designated as part of a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] under the name ''[[Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range]]''.

Yoshino Mountain was the subject of a ''[[Waka (poetry)|waka]]'' poem in the 10th century poetry compilation ''[[Kokin Wakashū]]''.  It is also the subject of several poems in the ''[[Ogura Hyakunin Isshu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mostow, Joshua S., ed. (1996). ''Pictures of the Heart: The Hyakunin Isshu in Word and Image'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several important religious and pilgrimage destinations are located around Mount Yoshino, including [[Yoshino Mikumari Shrine]], [[Kinpu Shrine (Yoshino)|Kimpu Shrine]], and [[Kimpusen-ji]].  It is well known for its [[Sakura|cherry blossom]]s, and attracts many visitors every autumn.

Yoshino Mountain is famous for its many thousands of [[sakura]] trees, and is heavily referenced in both traditional ''[[Waka (poetry)|waka]]'' poetry and folk song for its abundance of flowers in the spring, with famous poets such as [[Fukuda Chiyo-ni|Chiyo]] offering prose on the peak and its many flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gill |first1=Robin |title=Cherry Blossom Epiphany: The Poetry and Philosophy of a Flowering Tree |date=2006 |publisher=Paraverse Press |isbn=0974261866 |pages=632–678 of 740 |edition=1st }}&lt;/ref&gt; These flowering specimen trees were planted in four groves at different altitudes, in part so that the famed trees would come into bloom at different times of the spring. A 1714 account explained that, on their climb to the top, travelers would be able to enjoy the lower 1,000 cherry trees at the base, the middle 1,000 on the way, the upper 1,000 toward the top, and the 1,000 in the precincts of the inner shrine at the top.&lt;ref&gt;Kaibara Ekiken.

'''''Pagan Theology: Paganism as a World Religion''''' is a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomical]] study of various world religions which argues for a new definition of the word "[[paganism]]". It was written by the British [[religious studies]] scholar [[Michael York (religious studies scholar)|Michael York]] of [[Bath Spa University]] and first published by [[New York University Press]] in 2003.

In ''Pagan Theology'', York presents his controversial theory that the term "paganism", originally a pejorative term to refer to non-Christian religions, should instead be used by scholars to refer specifically to those religious movements who share the common characteristics of [[polytheism]], [[animism]] and life-affirming beliefs. Under this category of "paganism", York therefore includes the extinct historical faiths of pre-Christian Europe, living [[indigenous religions]], several modern religions like [[Shinto]] and [[Hinduism]], and the new religious movements of [[Paganism (contemporary)|contemporary Paganism]]. Furthermore, York argues that this "paganism" was the "root religion" of humanity, from which later monotheistic religions like Judaism, Christianity and Islam developed.

Academic reviews of York's book were mixed, with reviewers making note of the ambitious nature of ''Pagan Theology'', but some believing that it failed to present an entirely convincing argument. As a result of this, not all of them agreed with York's proposed categories, citing various reasons why they believed that it should not be employed. In the wider field of [[Pagan studies]] it has been criticised, most notably by Michael F. Strmiska, who argued that it contributed to the cultural oppression of indigenous peoples.

==Background==
At the time of writing, York was a self-proclaimed "pagan practitioner" as well as a religious studies academic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yor03|York 2003]]. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
Commenting on his own personal religious and spiritual beliefs, York related that:

:If I had to name my own denominational predilection, I would say that I am a "religionist." I believe in religion itself and its central role in expanding human consciousness above and beyond immediate daily concerns. I see religion as an ongoing dialogue that questions the purpose of life and our terrestrial incarnations. In my own pursuit and love of religion as religion, I have been particularly attracted to paganism not only as the source and origin of all religion but also as an organic alternative to the institutionalized and parochial insularity that much religious expression has become.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yor03|York 2003]]. p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
{{Expand section|date=November 2012}}
In his introduction, York explains his approach to [[religion]], which he chooses to define as "a shared apprehension of the world, humanity, and the supernatural and their interrelation." He proceeds to use a map as a metaphor for religion, noting that both help the individual to navigate their own way through the world. Exclaiming that paganism should be seen as a religion in itself, he criticises earlier religious studies scholars for failing to devote time to a discussion of this term, whose etymology he then explains.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yor03|York 2003]]. pp. 1&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the next chapter, entitled "Paganism as Religion", York argues that religious studies scholars should not use "paganism" in reference purely to pre-Christian religions in Europe or [[Paganism (contemporary)|Neopaganism]], but expand it to refer to a far wider group of [[animism|animistic]], [[polytheism|polytheistic]] beliefs across the world. Putting together a list of five criteria that believes can be used to define "paganism", he then explores a series of seven different religious groups or beliefs and explains how they fit into this category of his: [[Chinese Folk Religion]], [[Shinto]], Primal Tribal Religions, [[shamanism]], American Indian Spirituality, Afro-American Spiritism, and Contemporary Western Paganism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yor03|York 2003]]. pp. 8&amp;ndash;65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==

===Redefining "paganism"===
In ''Pagan Theology'', York exclaims that his purpose is to "expand the concept of paganism."&lt;ref name="York 8"&gt;[[#Yor03|York 2003]]. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that the term had been originally employed by the early Christians of the [[Roman Empire]] to describe adherents of non-Jewish religions, he notes that the pre-Christian and pre-Islamic beliefs of Europe that this initial description covered are similar to other [[Indigenous religion]]s across the world, and so should also be considered to be "pagan".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yor03|York 2003]]. pp. 5&amp;ndash;6.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, York argues that religious studies scholars should define "paganism" as a religion utilising five specific criteria, all of which were exhibited in the pre-Christian religions of Europe:

:"[P]aganism includes (1) a number of both male and female gods, (2) magical practice, (3) emphasis on ritual efficacy, (4) corpospirituality, and (5) an understanding of gods and humans as codependent and related."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yor03|York 2003]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

York argues that many of the world's religious movements fit these criteria and should therefore be labelled "pagan". This includes the original pre-Christian religions of Europe, and the [[Paganism (contemporary)|Contemporary Pagan, or ''Neopagan'']] religions inspired by them. To this he adds indigenous religions from North America, Australia and Africa, as well as the religions of the African diaspora such as [[West African Vodun|Vodou]] and [[Santeria]]. He furthermore includes two east Asian faiths, [[Chinese traditional religion]] and Japanese [[Shinto]], as well as any practices involving [[shamanism]].

Utilising the figures for global religious adherence that were published by David Barrett in his ''World Christian Encyclopedia'' (1982), York argues that by the year 2000, 6% of the world's population would be "pagan" under his definition of the term.&lt;ref name="York 8"/&gt; According to his reckoning, this makes paganism one of the world's major religious blocs, alongside the "[[Abrahamic religion|Christian-Islamic]]" bloc, the "[[Irreligion|nonreligious/atheist]]" bloc, the "[[Indian religions|Hindu-Buddhist]]" bloc, the "[[new religious movement|new religious]]" block and the "other" bloc, and that as such it should be defined as a [[world religion]] with global coverage.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yor03|York 2003]]. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

In her review for the ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'', Melissa Raphael of the [[University of Gloucestershire]] argued that York's work "does well to remind us that the religious academy has for too long patronized, ignored or (inaccurately) consigned pagan religion and spirituality to the "odds and ends" bin of the [[New Age movement]]." Considering ''Pagan Theology'' to be a "dense and serious study", that was based upon York's "exceptionally well traveled" experiences, Raphael noted however that it was "not quite what I was expecting. The main title would have led me to believe that I had found a book on the divine in Western, earth-based neo-pagan religions. ''Pagan Theology'' is a good deal more ambitious than that".&lt;ref name="Raphael 2004"/&gt; Raphael proceeded to argue that she was "disappointed" that the work "paid little attention to the inflections of gender", in particular considering the prominent role held by female deities in most of the pagan religions described in the book. She also felt some "disquiet" that the word "theology" was being used by York in reference to certain religious groups for whom "the philosophical and cultural freighting of both ''logos'' and ''theos'' are categorically and conceptually alien". Furthermore, she expressed concern over the fact that "many of the religions to which York ascribes paganism would disown it" whilst others would "deny that they share any common essence with other religions."&lt;ref name="Raphael 2004"/&gt;

In her review for the ''[[Sociology of Religion]]'' journal, Mary Jo Neitz of the [[University of Missouri]] noted that she agreed with York that "paganism is a legitimate category of religion for both practitioners and for those of us who study religion." Nonetheless, she disagreed with his position of "establishing universal definitions of paganism as a world religion or an essential practice", arguing that in doing so he was "gloss[ing] over significant differences" between different religious groups by "universalizing" them under cover-all categories. On a more positive note, she felt that the book would be a useful text for those studying courses on world religions, aiding students in asking the question as to "what scholars mean by the category of world religion itself, and who is served by maintaining the traditional boundaries which establish those belief systems and practices that count as insider and those which must be cast outside."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nei04|Neitz 2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies]]'', Barbara Jane Davy of [[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]] described ''Pagan Theology'' as being "Part travelogue, part theological argument, [and] part sociological study", providing a "tour through paganism's multiple forms in space and time." Believing that York had presented "a good argument" for using the term "paganism" to refer to a global "root religion", she noted however that "Some readers will sense a conflict between York's presentation of paganism as a world religion and as root religion. This perhaps derives from an ambiguity in his desires about paganism: for it to be a 'proper' religion, worthy of study, and a legitimate form of religious practice, but also to present it as distinctive, unlike all other religion, and as foundational to all religion." She also praised his use of the lower case "paganism" to refer to the global phenomenon, arguing that it "differentiates his subject matter from what is usually understood in Pagan studies as contemporary Paganism, Neopaganism, or sometimes modern or Western Paganism."&lt;ref name="Davy 2004"/&gt; Ultimately, she remarked that her "only complaint" was that she would have liked to have seen York "relate his understanding of paganism to [[Robert Redfield]]'s understanding of folk practices in terms of "little traditions" as opposed to the institutionalized "great traditions" usually identified as "world religions," discussed in ''The Little Community and Peasant Society and Culture'' (1969)."&lt;ref name="Davy 2004"/&gt;

===Reception in Pagan studies scholarship===

====Chas S. Clifton and ''The Pomegranate''====
Writing in volume 6.1 of ''[[The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies]]'' (2004), the journal's editor, [[Chas S. Clifton]] of [[Colorado State University–Pueblo]], made reference to York's work in his discussion of the definition of Pagan studies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Clifton proceeded to argue that the development of Pagan studies was necessary to "set forth an audacious redefinition of the term "pagan" as Michael York has done", something which Clifton felt "gives us room to reexamine from fresh perspectives all manifestation of ancient Pagan religions".&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 7&amp;ndash;8"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. pp. 7&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern European-derived Paganism and Native American and other Indigenous religions of non-European origins involve similar elements, such as reverence for nature, polytheistic pantheons, and life- and body-affirming worldviews, but there are differences as well, stemming from their different cultural, linguistic, and historical backgrounds."
|salign    = right
|source    = Michael F. Strmiska, explaining his opposition to York's ideas, 2005.&lt;ref name="Strmiska 2005 12"&gt;[[#Str05|Strmiska 2005]]. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Writing in the opening paper of his edited academic anthology ''[[Modern Paganism in World Cultures|Modern Paganism in World Cultures: Comparative Perspectives]]'' (2005), the American religious studies scholar Michael F. Strmiska, then working at [[Central Connecticut State University]], commented on York's argument in ''Pagan Theology'', noting that it was the same as that made by the political scientist and practicing Wiccan Gus DiZerega in his book ''Pagans and Christians: The Personal Spiritual Experience'' (2001).&lt;ref name="Strmiska 2005 11"&gt;[[#Str05|Strmiska 2005]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although considering such a theory to be "thought provoking", Strmiska ultimately rejected it because he felt that "blurring together the religious identities of these many different peoples, with their vastly different historical and contemporary situations, does a disservice to Indigenous peoples' struggles for postcolonial self-determination by conflating them with the very peoples they see as their oppressors and colonizers."&lt;ref name="Strmiska 2005 11"/&gt; Although accepting that "modern Euro-American Pagans" were often "sympathetic" to Indigenous peoples and "interested in learning aspects" of their "cultural and religious traditions", Strmiska noted that the "contemporary situations" between the two ethno-cultural groups was "quite different" and that this "brutal social reality and the immense historical, economic, and political realities that lie behind it cannot be bridged by a simple labelling process or ameliorated by a unilateral proclamation of spiritual unity between modern Pagans and Indigenous peoples."&lt;ref name="Strmiska 2005 12"/&gt;

Strmiska also felt that it was "worth observing the simple courtesy of calling people by the names they wish to be known by and not calling them by names they reject or are uncomfortable with. The designations ''Pagan'' and ''Paganism'', let alone ''Neopagan'' or ''Neopaganism'', are not the terms of choice that Native Americans or other Indigenous peoples usually apply to themselves and their religious traditions."&lt;ref name="Strmiska 2005 13"&gt;[[#Str05|Strmiska 2005]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He proceeded to argue that "[d]isagreements over terminology may seem petty or trivial, but they are not if we consider what is at stake for modern Pagans." In particular, he noted both the historical persecution of those labelled pagans and the continued "legal and political" oppression of modern Pagans.&lt;ref name="Strmiska 2005 13"/&gt;

In [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]],&lt;ref&gt;Greek Παλλάδιον; Latin ''palladium'' {{harv|Chisholm|1911|p=636}}&lt;/ref&gt; the '''palladium''' or '''palladion''' was a [[cult image]] of great antiquity on which the safety of [[Troy]] and later [[Rome]] was said to depend, the wooden statue (''[[xoanon]]'') of [[Pallas Athena]] that [[Odysseus]] and [[Diomedes]] stole from the [[citadel]] of [[Troy]] and which was later taken to the future site of [[Rome]] by [[Aeneas]]. The Roman story is related in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' and other works.

In [[English language|English]], since around 1600, the word [[Palladium (protective image)|palladium]] has been used figuratively to mean anything believed to provide protection or safety,&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Palladium, 2", first recorded use 1600&lt;/ref&gt; and in particular in Christian contexts a sacred [[relic]] or [[icon]] believed to have a protective role in military contexts for a whole city, people or nation.  Such beliefs first become prominent in the Eastern church in the period after the reign of the Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]], and later spread to the Western church.  Palladia were carried in procession around the walls of besieged cities and sometimes carried into battle.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1954|pp=109–112}}

==The Trojan Palladium==

===Origins===
The Trojan Palladium was said to be a wooden image of [[Pallas (daughter of Triton)|Pallas]] (whom the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] identified with [[Athena]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] with Minerva) and to have fallen from heaven in answer to the prayer of [[Ilus]], the founder of [[Troy]].

"The most ancient talismanic [[effigy|effigies]] of Athena," [[Carl Ruck|Ruck]] and [[Danny Staples|Staples]] report, "...&amp;nbsp;were magical found objects, faceless pillars of Earth in the old manner, before the Goddess was [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] and given form through the intervention of human intellectual meddling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Carl Ruck |author2=Danny Staples |title=The World of Classical Myth |date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival at Troy===
The arrival at Troy of the Palladium, fashioned by Athena&lt;ref&gt;The trope of an icon not fashioned by human hands survives in the Christian ''[[acheiropoieta]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; in remorse for the death of Pallas,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bibliotheke]]'' iii.144.&lt;/ref&gt;  as part of the city's [[founding myth]], was variously referred to by Greeks, from the seventh century BC onwards. The Palladium was linked to the [[Samothrace temple complex|Samothrace mysteries]] through the pre-Olympian figure of [[Electra (Pleiad)|Elektra]], mother of Dardanus, progenitor of the Trojan royal line, and of [[Iasion]], founder of the Samothrace mysteries.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bibliotheke]]'', iii.10.1, iii.12.1 and 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether Elektra had come to Athena's shrine of the Palladium as a pregnant suppliant and a god cast it into the territory of Ilium, because it had been profaned by the hands of a woman who was not a virgin,&lt;ref&gt;''Bibliotheke'' iii.145.&lt;/ref&gt; or whether Elektra carried it herself&lt;ref&gt;Scholia on Euripides ''Phoenissae'' 1136.&lt;/ref&gt; or whether it was given directly to Dardanus&lt;ref&gt;[[Triphiodorus]] (fourth century AD), ''Taking of Ilios'' ([http://www.theoi.com/Text/Tryphiodorus.html on-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt; vary in sources and [[Scholium|scholia]]. In Ilion, King [[Ilus]] was blinded for touching the image to preserve it from a burning temple.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dercyllus]], ''Foundations of Cities'', Book i, noted by Pseudo-Plutarch ''Parallel Stories'', "Ilus and Anytus".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theft===
[[Image:Diomedes Odysseus Palladion Louvre K36.jpg| thumbnail|upright|left|Odysseus and Diomedes steal the Palladium from Troy. ([[Apulia]]n red-figure ''[[oinochoe]]'' of ''ca.'' 360–350 BC from [[Reggio di Calabria]].)]]

During the [[Trojan War]], the importance of the Palladium to Troy was said to have been revealed to the Greeks by [[Helenus]], the prophetic son of [[Priam]]. After Paris' death, Helenus left the city but was captured by Odysseus. The Greeks somehow managed to persuade the warrior seer to reveal the weakness of Troy. The Greeks learned from Helenus, that Troy would not fall while the Palladium, image or statue of Athena, remained within Troy's walls. The difficult task of stealing this sacred statue again fell upon the shoulders of Odysseus and Diomedes. Since Troy could not be captured while it safeguarded this image, the Greeks [[Diomedes]] and [[Odysseus]] made their way to the [[citadel]] in Troy by a [[secret passage]] and carried it off. In this way the Greeks were then able to enter Troy and lay it waste using the deceit of the [[Trojan Horse]].

Odysseus, according to the [[epitome]] of the ''[[Little Iliad]]'' (one of the books of the &lt;em&gt;[[Epic Cycle]]&lt;/em&gt;) preserved in [[Proclus|Proclus's]] ''[[Chrestomathy|Chrestomathia]]'', went by night to Troy in disguise and entered the city as a beggar. There he was recognized by [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], who told him where the Palladium was. After killing some of the Trojans, he returned to the ships. He and Diomedes then re-entered the city and stole the Palladium.

Diomedes is sometimes regarded as the person who physically removed the Palladium and carried it away to the ships. There are several statues and many ancient drawings of him with the Palladium.

According to the ''Narratives'' of the [[Augustus|Augustan period]] mythographer [[Conon (mythographer)|Conon]] as summarised by [[Photius]]&lt;ref&gt;Photius, &lt;em&gt;Bibliotheca&lt;/em&gt; 186.&lt;/ref&gt;, while the two heroes were on their way to the ships, Odysseus plotted to kill Diomedes and claim the Palladium (or perhaps the credit for gaining it) for himself. He raised his sword to stab Diomedes in the back. Diomedes was alerted to the danger by glimpsing the gleam of the sword in the moonlight. He disarmed Odysseus, tied his hands, and drove him along in front, beating his back with the flat of his sword. From this action was said to have arisen the Greek proverbial expression "Diomedes' necessity", applied to those who act under compulsion.&lt;ref&gt;This incident was commemorated in 1842 by the French sculptor [[Pierre-Jules Cavelier]] (1814–94) in a muscle-bound plaster statue; it depicts Diomedes alone, his noble face peering apprehensively over his right shoulder, as he cradles the Palladium.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Odysseus was essential for the destruction of Troy, Diomedes refrained from punishing him.

Diomedes took the Palladium with him when he left Troy. According to some stories, he brought it to Italy. Some say that it was stolen from him on the way.

===Arrival at Rome===
[[File:Pallas-athena-roman-mosaic.jpg|thumb|A 3rd-century Roman [[Pallas Athena]] [[mosaic]] from [[Tusculum]], now in the [[Vatican Museums]]]]
According to various versions of this legend the Trojan Palladium found its way to [[Athens]], or [[Argos]], or [[Sparta]] (all in [[Greece]]), or [[Rome]] in [[Italy]]. To this last city it was either brought by Aeneas the exiled Trojan (Diomedes, in this version, having only succeeded in stealing an imitation of the statue) or surrendered by Diomedes himself. It was kept there in the [[Temple of Vesta]] in the [[Roman Forum]] for centuries. It was regarded as one of the ''[[pignora imperii]]'', sacred tokens or pledges of Roman rule ''([[imperium]])''.

[[Pliny the Elder]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''; VII, XLV&lt;/ref&gt; said that [[Lucius Caecilius Metellus (consul 251 BC)|Lucius Caecilius Metellus]] had been blinded by fire when he rescued the Palladium from the [[Temple of Vesta]] in 241 BC, an episode alluded to in [[Ovid]]&lt;ref&gt;Fast. B. vi. 1. 436, et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Valerius Maximus]].&lt;ref&gt;B. i. c. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

When the controversial emperor [[Elagabalus]] (reigned 218–222) transferred the most sacred relics of Roman religion from their respective shrines to the [[Elagabalium]], the Palladium was among them.&lt;ref&gt;''Augustan History'', Life of Elagabalus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html#3.4 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Late Antiquity]], it was rumored that the Palladium was transferred from Rome to [[Constantinople]] by [[Constantine the Great]] and buried under the [[Column of Constantine]] in his forum.{{sfn|Cameron|1993|p=170}} Such a move would have undermined the primacy of Rome, and was naturally seen as a move by Constantine to legitimize his reign.

==The Athenian Palladium==
The goddess Athena was worshipped on the [[Acropolis of Athens]] under many names and cults, the most illustrious of which was of the ''Athena Poliás'', "[[tutelary deity|protectress]] of the city".  The cult image of the ''Poliás'' was a wooden effigy, often referred to as the "''xóanon diipetés''" (the "carving that fell from heaven"), made of olive wood and housed in the east-facing wing of the [[Erechtheum]] temple in the classical era.  Considered not a man-made artefact but of divine provenance, it was the holiest image of the goddess and was accorded the highest respect. It was placed under a bronze likeness of a palm tree and a gold lamp burned in front of it. The centerpiece of the grand feast of the [[Panathenaea]] was the replacement of this statue's woolen [[peplos|veil]] with a newly woven one.  It was also carried to the sea by the priestesses and ceremonially washed once a year, in the feast called the ''[[Plynteria]]'' ("washings"). Its presence was last mentioned by the [[Church Father]] [[Tertullian]] (''[[Apologeticus]]'' 16.6), who, in the late 2nd century AD, described it derisively as being nothing but "a rough stake, a shapeless piece of wood" ([[Latin]] original: "''[] Pallas Attica [] quae sine effigie rudi palo et informi ligno prostat?''"). Earlier descriptions of the statue have not survived.

The '''Purification Rundown''', also known as the '''Purif'''&lt;ref name="bouma"&gt;{{cite book|title=Australian Soul: Religion and Spirituality in the 21st Century |first=Gary D. |last=Bouma|publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=2006|page=9|isbn=0-521-67389-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''Hubbard Method''',&lt;ref name="welkos" /&gt; is a controversial [[detoxification]]  program developed by Scientology's founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and used by the [[Church of Scientology]] as an introductory service.&lt;ref name="bouma" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refslund"&gt;{{cite book|last=Christensen|first=Dorthe Refslund|title=Scientology|editor=James R.

Hubbard put forward his ideas about [[niacin]] in a book called ''[[All About Radiation]]''. He claimed to have discovered that large doses of vitamins could both alleviate and prevent [[radiation sickness]].&lt;ref name="atack142"&gt;{{cite book |first=Jon | last=Atack | year=1990| title = A Piece of Blue Sky: Scientology, Dianetics and L. Ron Hubbard Exposed |publisher = Lyle Stuart / Carol Publishing Group |isbn=0-8184-0499-X|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; He marketed this anti-radiation mixture in the form of a tablet, calling it "[[Dianazene]]". Twenty-one thousand such tablets were seized and destroyed by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Ian|title=The Alms Trade: Charities, Past, Present and Future|publisher=Cosimo|year=2007|pages=130|isbn=1-60206-753-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1979 predecessor of the Purification Rundown was known as the "Sweat Program" and was similarly designed to remove traces of [[LSD]] which, according to Hubbard, remained for long periods in the body.&lt;ref name="refslund" /&gt;&lt;ref name="atack254"&gt;{{cite book |first=Jon | last=Atack | year=1990| title = A Piece of Blue Sky: Scientology, Dianetics and L. Ron Hubbard Exposed |publisher = Lyle Stuart / Carol Publishing Group |isbn=0-8184-0499-X|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participant had a restricted diet, including large doses of vitamins and a teaspoon of salt, and spent at least an hour a day jogging in a rubberised suit. For some, this regimen lasted for months.&lt;ref name="atack254" /&gt;

The program was developed for use in Narconon,&lt;ref name="hollywood"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ebner, Mark C. |author2=Andrew Breitbart |title=Hollywood, interrupted|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=Chichester |year=2004 |pages=129 |isbn=0-471-45051-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was published in Hubbard's ''Technical Bulletins of Dianetics and Scientology'' as well as the book ''[[Clear Body, Clear Mind]]''.&lt;ref name="refslund"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyp_rundown" /&gt; Two other books describe the procedure, ''Purification: An Illustrated Answer To Drugs''&lt;ref name="refslund" /&gt; and ''Narconon New Life Detoxification Program: the effective purification program by L. Ron Hubbard.'' The term "Purification Rundown" is a [[trademark]] of the [[Religious Technology Center]] (the governing body of the [[Church of Scientology]]), though an RTC spokesman has denied any licensing arrangement with Narconon.&lt;ref name="bostonherald1998" /&gt;

== Process ==
The Purification Rundown usually takes several weeks. As well as spending time in saunas, people are required to do light exercise including [[calisthenics]], treadmills, and other similar activities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The program consists of a course of doses of vitamins ([[niacin]] in particular), long periods in a [[sauna]], exercise, and consumption of a blend of vegetable oils, in the belief that the subject will sweat out the toxins and replace the oils in the body's fatty tissues with the vegetable oil.&lt;ref name="mccall" /&gt; ''[[Clear Body, Clear Mind]]'' recommends that participants maintain their normal diet throughout the procedure, supplemented with fresh vegetables.&lt;ref name="cbcm19" /&gt;

The program requires its participants to ingest the following at regular intervals:
* A multi-vitamin cocktail, the main ingredient of which is [[niacin]]. ''Clear Body, Clear Mind'' recommends initial doses of 100&amp;nbsp;mg, increasing to 5,000&amp;nbsp;mg over the course of the program.&lt;ref name="nyp_rundown" /&gt; This contrasts with the medically recommended level of about 15&amp;nbsp;mg: larger doses can have severe, even potentially fatal side effects.&lt;ref name="nyp_rundown" /&gt; The participant is told to expect toxic symptoms due to the release of poisons or radiation from their body fat.&lt;ref name="rtp"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staudenmayer|first=Herman|year=1996|title=Clinical Consequences of the EI/MCS "Diagnosis": Two Paths |journal=Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology|publisher=Academic Press|volume=24|issue=1|pages=S96–S110|issn=0273-2300|doi=10.1006/rtph.1996.0084|pmid=8921563 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the effects of niacin overdose, which include skin irritation, [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]], [[dizziness]] and [[headache]], are interpreted as a positive effect of the rundown.&lt;ref name="nyp_rundown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rtp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ebner1996" /&gt;
* Mineral supplements, including [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[manganese]], [[copper]], [[iodine]] and [[potassium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hubbard|first=L.

* Up to half a cupful of pure oils per day.&lt;ref name="mccall" /&gt;
* "CalMag", a drink which ''Clear Body, Clear Mind'' describes as a solution of [[calcium gluconate]], [[magnesium carbonate]] and [[vinegar]] in water, in such proportions that the mix has twice as much elemental [[calcium]] as [[magnesium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hubbard|first=L.

Hubbard specified that each participant must complete a daily report form, listing the amounts of vitamins, minerals, Cal-Mag  and other fluids taken, which is reviewed to make sure they are complying with every aspect of the program.&lt;ref name="cbcm113"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hubbard|first=L.

The cost of the program was reported as about [[US dollars|US$]]2,000 in 1990&lt;ref name="welkos"&gt;{{cite news | last =Sappell | first =Joel |author2=Robert W.

''Clear Body, Clear Mind'' contains a disclaimer which states that the program is not a medical treatment.&lt;ref name="nyp_rundown" /&gt; A similar disclaimer appears in the Hubbard Communication Office Bulletins, noting that the treatment is not a medical process but a purely spiritual activity.&lt;ref name="nyp_rundown" /&gt; Hubbard recommends that the participant should sign a waiver noting that the program is not medical treatment.&lt;ref name="nyp_rundown" /&gt;

== Promotion ==
The Purification Rundown is promoted as having physical and mental benefits such as lowering [[cholesterol]], relieving pain, and improving memory. Scientology's promotional materials claim it can boost [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]] by up to 15 points.&lt;ref name="nyp_rundown" /&gt; Scientologists are strongly encouraged to take part in the program as a necessary step in their spiritual progress.&lt;ref name="bouma" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bostonherald1998"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Boston Herald]] | last=Mallia|first=Joseph| date=March 3, 1998| title=Scientology reaches into schools through Narconon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology promotes the Rundown to the public as a [[detoxification]] program, while it also works with non-religious Scientology-affiliated groups such as Narconon to offer this program as a treatment for addiction and high levels of [[stress (medicine)|stress]]. Conditions that are claimed by Scientologists to respond to the program include [[cancer]], [[AIDS]], [[heart disease|heart problems]], [[renal failure|kidney failure]], [[liver failure|liver disease]] and [[obesity]].&lt;ref name="sptimes" /&gt;

In a January 1980 announcement, Hubbard told his followers that a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] was an imminent threat and that the Rundown would enable them to deal with heavy [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]].&lt;ref name="atack259" /&gt; He warned that  those who completed the program would stand  better chances of survival.&lt;ref name="atack259"&gt;{{cite book |first=Jon | last=Atack | year=1990| title = A Piece of Blue Sky: Scientology, Dianetics and L. Ron Hubbard Exposed |publisher = Lyle Stuart / Carol Publishing Group |isbn=0-8184-0499-X|pages=259–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Scientology unsuccessfully tried to have the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] awarded to Hubbard for his invention of the program.&lt;ref name="atack259" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-aide tells of Hubbard try to gain Nobel Prize|last=Lyneis|first=Dick|date=December 25, 1982|location=Riverside, California|work=Press Enterprise|pages=B–1, B-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In California, two organizations have been set up by Scientologists to try to give scientific legitimacy to the program. These were the [[Foundation for Advancements in Science and Education]] and the [[HealthMed Clinic]]. The Executive Director of the Church of Scientology was involved in creating the Foundation and later described it as a "front group". The Foundation funded research and published articles by Scientologists hailing the effectiveness of Hubbard's procedures. HealthMed, an ostensibly independent organization, used this material to promote the Rundown to public agencies all over the state. Both bodies were strongly criticized by a group of physicians from the California Department of Health Services.&lt;ref name="welkos" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ljwest"&gt;{{cite journal|last=West|first=Louis Jolyon|date=October 1991|title=Scientology III|journal=The Southern California Psychiatrist|publisher=Southern California Psychiatric Society|pages=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rundown, as delivered by HealthMed, is heavily promoted in the book ''Diet for a Poisoned Planet'' by journalist [[David Steinman]], who denies any connection with the Church of Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The New Naturalism Controversy Eats at `Diet for a Poisoned Planet'|last=Puzo|first=Daniel P.|date=November 29, 1990|work=Los Angeles Times|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Behar"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,156952,00.html|title=The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power|last=Behar|first=Richard|date=May 6, 1991|work=Time magazine|accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was the subject of a paper from the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] which accused Steinman of distorting facts.&lt;ref name="Behar" /&gt; [[C.

==Reception==

===Theoretical basis===
The theory behind the Purification Rundown is that toxins, drugs, and radioactive particles are stored in body fat, which are released through the exchange of fats (thus the oil consumption) and exercise, and then finally released via [[perspiration]] and other normal mechanisms such as body waste.&lt;ref name="mccall"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCall|first=W.

A 1995 review at a medical conference described the massive doses of niacin as inappropriate, especially since they cause the release of [[histamine]], which is counterproductive when dealing with chemical sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt, T. (1995) "Sauna-Depuration: Toxicokinetics" presentation at 2nd Aspen Environmental Medicine Conference. Aspen, Colorado, September 7–9. cited in 
{{cite book|last=Staudenmayer|first=Herman|title=Environmental Illness: myth and reality|publisher=CRC Press|year=1998|pages=48|isbn=978-1-56670-305-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Herman Staudenmayer]] describes the program as part of a trend for diagnosing and treating a [[Multiple Chemical Sensitivity]] disorder which does not correspond to any known disease and is likely to be [[Psychophysiology|psychophysiological]].&lt;ref name="rtp" /&gt; He adds, "The position statements of medical societies [...] are unambiguous about the lack of scientific evidence for these practices."&lt;ref name="rtp" /&gt;

In January 2005, a group of five doctors and nine health education experts acting on behalf of the [[California Department of Education]] issued a report examining Narconon and its materials. The report described the key assumptions of the program as unscientific and inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/02/23/MNGQJBFKV81.DTL|title=Schools urged to drop antidrug program|last=Asimov|first=Nanette|date=February 23, 2005|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2009-02-14|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three experts consulted by ''[[The Buffalo News]]'' criticised the weak evidence and dubious assumptions behind the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Mark | last=Sommer | title = Addiction specialists criticize detoxification program | work=[[Buffalo News]] | date = February 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Root, a medical doctor affiliated with Narconon, has administered the program for twenty years and stands by the theory behind it.&lt;ref name="snr"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gianni|first=Luke|url=http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Content?oid=283982 |title=Scientology does detox, David E.

===Effectiveness and safety===
An investigation by the ''[[New York Press]]'' asked a number of independent doctors about the evidence for the Purification Rundown. None of them endorsed the program's effectiveness and some explicitly described it as dangerous. Several said that no [[Peer review|peer-reviewed research]] on the rundown had been published in any medical journal.&lt;ref name="nyp_rundown" /&gt; Some apparently supportive studies have been published, but these lack [[Scientific control|control groups]] and have other scientific failings.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite news | first = Amanda | last = Schaffer | title = Poisons, Begone!

''Newkirk Herald Journal'' editor Robert W. Lobsinger solicited a number of medical experts' opinions on the program in 1989.&lt;ref name="newkirk" /&gt; James Kenney of [[the National Council Against Health Fraud]] condemned those administering the "unproven" treatment as guilty of health fraud. He wrote that "[...] the scientific evidence shows the exact opposite of what Hubbard's theory predicts", warning that large doses of niacin could cause liver damage, [[gout]], [[gastritis]], and other serious side-effects. Dr. David Hogg of Toronto said that the program may be detrimental to participants' health.&lt;ref name="newkirk"&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Newkirk Herald Journal |title=Medical and Scientific Opinions Regarding The Purification Rundown As Practiced By The Narconon Drug Treatment Program|url=http://www.newkirkherald.com/Newkirk%20Homepage/nsp/nsp5.html|accessdate=2009-01-22|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. C. Mark Palmer of [[Ponca City, Oklahoma]] rebutted the theory that sweating would clear out drugs, stating that "No matter how much a patient were made to sweat, it could not significantly increase his clearing of most drugs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Oklahoman]] |title=Drug Center Proposal Criticized |date=September 1, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After reviewing materials published by Narconon, [[University of Oklahoma]] biochemistry professor Bruce Roe described the program as "a scam" based on "half-truths and pseudo-science."&lt;ref name="philadelphia7" /&gt; In a 1988 report, Dr. Ronald E. Gots, a [[toxicology]] expert from [[Bethesda, Maryland]], called the regimen "quackery", and noted that "no recognized body of toxicologists, no department of occupational medicine, nor any governmental agencies endorse or recommend such treatment."&lt;ref name="nyt_lure" /&gt; In 1991, the Board of Mental Health in [[Oklahoma]] refused to certify the program for use in a Narconon facility on the grounds of potential danger from its high vitamin and mineral doses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation | title=Editorial: Tom Cruise is dangerous and irresponsible|volume=115|issue=8 |date=August 1, 2005 |pages=1964–1965 |doi=10.1172/JCI26200|first=Ushma S. |last=Neill| pmid=16075033| pmc=1180571}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report on Narconon for the [[California Health and Human Services Agency|Department of Health]] in California described the mega-doses of vitamins as "hazardous" and "in some cases lethal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RPoNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RXsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6687%2C4378405|title=Narconon|last=Roberton|first=Craig|date=December 28, 1981|work=St. Petersburg Times|pages=1–B|accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Michael Ryan, a [[pharmacologist]] at [[University College Dublin]], testified in a 2003 court case that the program is scientifically unverified and medically unsafe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Church's purification course unsafe - expert | work=[[The Irish Times]] |date=February 6, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some doctors who have observed the treatment have been impressed by the testimonials but asked for evidence that improvements are caused by the program itself rather than [[suggestion]], [[delusion]] or the [[Placebo|placebo effect]].&lt;ref name="philadelphia7" /&gt; In 2007, [[psychopharmacology]] expert John Brick said of his visit to a Manhattan clinic, "Whether it's from some mysterious combination of vitamins or just good diet and exercise, I can't say. But the bottom line is that it helped the patients I talked to." He emphasized the importance of independently verifying the validity of the program, conceding that no causal relationship between the results and the program had been demonstrated.&lt;ref name="philadelphia7"&gt;{{cite news | first = Art | last = Carey| title = Clinic's results make 9/11 responders believe | work =[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]| date = October 7, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024144711/http://www.philly.com/inquirer/health_science/daily/20071007_Clinics_results_make_9_11_responders_believe.html | archivedate=2007-10-24|url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/health_science/daily/20071007_Clinics_results_make_9_11_responders_believe.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adverse outcomes==
Paride Ella and Giuseppe Tomba, clients of Narconon in [[Taceno]], Italy, died in 1995 during the vitamin phase of the
program, suffering kidney problems and a heart attack respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tragedia nella lotta alla droga |last=Biglia|first=Andrea|date=February 20, 1995|work=[[Corriere della Sera]]|pages=13|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, journalist [[Mark Ebner]] described the case of a woman who had suffered [[Hyperthermia|heatstroke]] and [[anemia]] while on the program. {{quote|One day, she was found blue-lipped on the waiting room floor, hemorrhaging.

In 1997, two [[emergency room]] doctors reported treating a 45-year-old man who had participated in the Rundown. Previously healthy, he had developed tremors while on the program, for which the Church of Scientology recommended further Purification as treatment. Put back in the sauna, he developed seizures and was taken to hospital in an incoherent state. He was diagnosed with severe [[hyponatremia]] and required three days of medical treatment.&lt;ref name="emergency1997" /&gt; In a similar case, a woman from [[Medina, Ohio]] required hospitalization after losing sleep and developing hallucinations during the program.&lt;ref name="sptimes" /&gt; In 2004, a former participant in the UK told reporters that the program had gravely worsened his physical condition, and that he had been denied medical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Washington|first=Sam|author2=Phil Kemp |date=January 2004|title=The Bridge to Freedom?|journal=[[New Humanist]]|publisher=The Rationalist Association|volume=119|issue=1|url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/684|accessdate=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]] covered costs for an alcoholic to go to Narconon for detoxification, but the council withdrew funding when the Church of Scientology connection was revealed.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/storm-over-cults-alcoholic-patient-1439574.html|title=Storm over cult's alcoholic patient |last=Oxford|first=Esther|date=May 31, 1994|work=The Independent|publisher=Independent News and Media|accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woman stayed on, funded by Narconon's trustees.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;

===Second Chance===
{{main|Second Chance Program}}

{{Main|New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project}}

The New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project is an initiative in New York City, co-founded by celebrity scientologist [[Tom Cruise]], which provides Purification Rundowns for public-sector employees who were exposed to toxins in the aftermath of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].

'''Raja Dina Nath Madan (Razdan)''' (1795 - 1857) aka '''Diwan Dina Nath''' or '''Dina Nath''', who was a [[Kashmir]]i, rose to the position of the [[Privy Seal]] and [[finance minister]] ([[Diwan (title)|Diwan]]) in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] empire of [[Maharaja]] [[Ranjit Singh]].

==Life==
Dina Nath was civil administrator and counsellor of considerable influence at the Sikh court for well over three decades, was the son of a Kashmiri Pandit, [[Bakht Mal]], who had migrated to [[Delhi]] in 1815, during the oppressive rule of the [[Afghan]] governors of the valley and obtained a berth in the Estate Office at Lahore. He was also closely related to Diwan Ganga Ram Raina, head of the military accounts and keeper of the privy seal at Lahore.

In 1815, at the instance of Diwan [[Ganga Ram Raina]], Maharaja Ranjit Singh invited Dina Nath to Lahore and offered him the post of mutsaddi, or writer, in the department of military accounts.

In 1826, when Diwan Ganga Ram died, Dina Nath succeeded him as the head of military accounts department and keeper of the privy seal. In 1834, when Diwan Bhavani Das died, the Maharaja made him the head of the civil and finance office and conferred upon him, in 1838, the honorary title of [[Diwan (title)|Diwan]].

By his ability and political acumen, Dina Nath rose to the highest position of power and influence in the affairs of the State. Lepel Griffin styles him the Talleyrand of the Punjab. After the Maharaja's death, Raja Dina Nath's influence increased.But Dina Nath knew how to keep his ambition in check and was one man in Lahore who made no enemies at the court.In the turbulent days following Ranjit Singh`s death, he refused to take sides with Rani Chand Kaur or Karivar Sher Singh. Sher Singh upon his succession to the throne, reposed his full trust in him. Dina Nath retained his position at the court during.

He was one of the signatories to the treaty which was concluded between the Sikhs and the British after the [[First Sikh War]]. Later, when a council was constituted in December 1846 for the governance of the Punjab, Raja Dina Nath was made its President, with the active support of the British.  He was the greatest man alive and most faithful to Maharaja Ranjit Singh.

Yet under the British rule he actively financed the independence efforts in secrecy.  The family of Raja Dina Nath came originally from Kashmir, where in the reign of the Mughal King [[Shah Jahan]], some members of it held offices relating to court affairs.

Dina Nath, whose father had a subordinate appointment at Delhi, came to the Panjab in 1815 and obtained a berth in the Estate Office at Lahore.He first attracted Ranjit Singh's notice in 1818 by the great rapidity and clearness with which he did some important work entrusted to him.

Among the men who rose to power during the later days of the Maharaja's life, no one was more remarkable than Raja Dina Nath.
He was well and happily styled Talleyrand of the Panjab and his life and character bore a strong resemblance to those of the European statesmen.

Revolutions in which his friends and patrons perished passed him by: in the midst of bloodshed and assassination his life was never endangered. While confiscation and judicial robbery were the rule of the State, his wealth and power continually increased.
His sagacity and far-sightedness were such that when to other eyes the political sky was clear, he could perceive the signs of coming storm, which warned him to desert a losing party, or a falling friend.

Honest men do not survive many revolutions, and the Raja's falseness was the means to his success.
He was patriotic, but his love of country was subordinate to self.
He hated the English bitterly, for they were stronger than he or his country, but his interest compelled him to serve, like Samson, the Philistines he hated.

He was not without his notions of fidelity, and would stand by a friend, as long as he could do so with safety to himself. Even when he deserted him it was more from thoughts of danger to his wealth and influence than from personal fear, for, Raja Dina Nath was physically brave, and also possessed moral courage in an eminent degree, though it did not lead him to do right regardless of consequences.He possessed immense local knowledge and vast capacity for work; but his desire of keeping power in his own hands had an evil effect on the progress of (State) business.

He was an accomplished man of the world, courteous and considerate; well educated though nothing of a scholar; and in conversation with Europeans he would express himself with a boldness and apparent candour that were as pleasant, as they are unusual in Asiatics.
It was only in 1834 that Raja Dina Nath was made Finance Minister for which his qualifications were exceedingly high, but Maharaja (Ranjit Singh) had for many years reposed confidence in him, and he was on all occasions of importance, one of his most talented advisers.

After the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, he retained great influence with the chiefs and the army, and on British occupation of Lahore was appointed to the Council of Regency, of which he was the most able and useful member.
Although his position as the Head of Financial Department gave him many opportunities of enriching himself at the public expense, I of which there is every reason to believe he availed himself, he still worked more disinterestedly than others, and was of great service to the Resident of Lahore.

In November 1847, the title of the Raja of Kalanaur, with a jagir worth 20,000 rupees annually, was conferred upon him. With his clear head and business-like habits, it would have been almost impossible to disentangle the Darbar Accountancy, and after the annexation of the Panjab, Dina Nath's aid in Revenue and Jagir matters was almost as valuable as before.

At the time of revolt of Sikh army in 1848, it was asserted by some that Raja Dina Nath was a traitor at heart, that he himself had Encouraged the rising, and that had he not been a wealthy man with houses and gardens and many lakhs of rupees in Lahore, convenient for confiscation, he would have joined the rebels without hesitation, but these stories were perhaps invented by his enemies. Certain it is that on being recalled to Lahore, he zealously carried out the wishes of the British authorities in counteracting their (i.e. the rebels' anti-British) schemes.

After the annexation of the Panjab, Raja Dina Nath was confirmed in all of his jagirs, worth Rs. 46,460, which he held till his death in 1857. He died near Kot Khawaja Saeed, at Lahore, Pakistan. There he had developed a beautiful garden and it is still called as 'Rajay Wala Bagh'. The spot is a few meters away towards West from Samadh Maharajah Sher Singh at Kot Khawaja Saeed, Lahore. His descendants are:

1. [[Raja Amar Nath Madan]]

2. [[Raja Man Nath Madan]]

3. [[Raja Gyan Nath Madan]]

4. [[Kanwar Bharam Nath Madan]]

5. [[Raja Ravindra Nath Madan]]

6. [[Raja Rajeev Madan]]

7. [[Kanwar Ramachandra Madan]]

Raja Gyan Nath Madan was the Prime Minister of Jaipur.  He was a CIE, a ‘Companion of the British Empire’, an honorary title bestowed upon him by the British, in recognition of his numerous services to the Empire.  Raja Gyan Nath Madan was also conferred the hereditary title of ‘Raja’ by the British, which could be passed onto and used by the eldest son of each successive generation.

He purchased Khud Cottage in 1939, several years prior to Partition, when his family settled in Shimla.  His son, Kanwar Bharamnath Madan, was the first Deputy Commissioner of Shimla.  Successively, the title of ‘Raja’ has been passed on to Raja Gyan Nath Madan’s grandson, Ravindra Nath Madan and currently his great grandson, Rajeev Madan, whom still owns Khud Cottage.

==Water well==
Dina Nath commissioned the [[Well of Dina Nath]] in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]] which, according to legend, has always been dry.

'''Scrupulosity''' is characterized by pathological guilt about moral or religious issues. It is personally distressing, objectively dysfunctional, and often accompanied by significant impairment in social functioning.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;&lt;ref name="linkinghub.elsevier.com"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Scrupulosity: A cognitive–behavioral analysis and implications for treatment|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211364914000116?via=sd|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically conceptualized as a moral or religious form of [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD),&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Deacon B, Nelson EA |title=On the nature and treatment of scrupulosity |journal=Pragmatic Case Stud Psychother |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=39–53 |year=2008 |url=http://jrul.libraries.rutgers.edu/index.php/pcsp/article/view/932/2329 |format=PDF |doi=10.14713/pcsp.v4i2.932}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this categorization is empirically disputable.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;

The term is derived from the Latin ''scrupulum'', a sharp stone, implying a stabbing pain on the [[conscience]].&lt;ref name="Miller-Hedges"&gt;{{vcite journal |author = Miller CH, Hedges DW|title = Scrupulosity disorder: an overview and introductory analysis|journal = J Anxiety Disord|volume = 22|issue = 6|pages = 1042–58|year = 2008|pmid = 18226490|doi = 10.1016/j.janxdis.2007.11.004}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Scrupulosity was formerly called ''scruples'' in religious contexts, but the word ''[[Scruples (disambiguation)|scruples]]'' now commonly refers to a troubling of the [[conscience]] rather than to the disorder.

As a personality trait, scrupulosity is a recognized diagnostic criterion for [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th, text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author=American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 301.4 Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/o-cpd.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes called "scrupulousness", but that word properly applies to the positive trait of having scruples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scrupulous |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/scrupulous |website=Dictionary.com |accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scrupulosity is a modern-day psychological problem that echoes a traditional use of the term ''scruples'' in a religious context, e.g. by [[Roman Catholic]]s, to mean obsessive concern with one's own sins and compulsive performance of religious devotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Ciarrocchi JW |date=1995 |title=The Doubting Disease: Help for Scrupulosity and Religious Compulsions |location=Mahwah, NJ |publisher=Paulist Press |isbn=0-8091-3553-1 |ref=Doubting }} Scruples: common and uncommon. p. 32–47.&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the term dates to the 12th century.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Taylor CZ |title=Religious addiction: obsession with spirituality |journal=Pastoral Psych |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=291–315 |doi=10.1023/A:1014074130084 |date=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several historical and religious figures suffered from doubts of sin, and expressed their pains. [[Ignatius of Loyola]], founder of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], wrote "After I have trodden upon a cross formed by two straws&amp;nbsp;... there comes to me from without a thought that I have sinned&amp;nbsp;... this is probably a scruple and temptation suggested by the enemy."&lt;ref name=van-Megen&gt;{{vcite book |chapter=Obsessive compulsive disorder and religion: a reconnaissance |author=van Megen HJGM, den Boer-Wolters D, Verhagen PJ |pages=271–82 |title=Religion and Psychiatry: Beyond Boundaries |editor=Verhagen P, Van Praag HM, López-Ibor JJ Jr, Cox J, Moussaoui D, editors |isbn=978-0-470-69471-8 |publisher=Wiley |date=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alphonsus Liguori]], the [[Redemptorists]]' founder, wrote of it as "groundless fear of sinning that arises from 'erroneous ideas'".&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; Although the condition was lifelong for Loyola and Liguori,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Rose S |date=2007 |title=St. Ignatius Loyola And The Early Jesuits |isbn=1-4086-2255-6 |chapter=Manresa—the spiritual exercises—1523 |pages=45–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Alphonsus de Liguori |editor=Jones FM, editor and translator |date=1999 |title=Selected Writings |location=Mahwah, NJ |publisher=Paulist Press |chapter=Peace for scrupulous souls |pages=209–18 |isbn=0-8091-3771-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thérèse of Lisieux]] stated that she recovered from her condition after 18 months, writing "One would have to pass through this martyrdom to understand it well, and for me to express what I experienced for a year and a half would be impossible."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Monahan J |date=2003 |title=Thérèse of Lisieux |page=45 |isbn=0-8091-6710-7 |publisher=Paulist Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] also suffered from obsessive doubts; in his mind, his omitting the word ''enim'' ("for") during the [[Eucharist]] was as horrible as laziness, divorce, or murdering one's parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Aho JA |date=2005 |title=Confession and Bookkeeping: the Religious, Moral, and Rhetorical Roots of Modern Accounting |location=Albany |publisher=State University of New York Press |chapter=Martin Luther and scrupulosity |pages=95–8 |isbn=0-7914-6545-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although historical religious figures such as Loyola, Luther and [[John Bunyan]] are commonly cited as examples of scrupulosity in modern self-help books, some of these retrospective diagnoses may be deeply ahistorical: these figures' obsession with salvation may have been excessive by modern standards, but that does not mean that it was pathological.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Cefalu P |title=The doubting disease: religious scrupulosity and obsessive–compulsive disorder in historical context |journal=J Med Humanit  |year=2010 |pmid=20127153 |doi=10.1007/s10912-010-9107-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scrupulosity's first known public description as a disorder was in 1691, by [[John Moore (Bishop of Ely)|John Moore]], who called it "religious melancholy" and said it made people "fear, that what they do, is so defective and unfit to be presented unto God, that he will not accept it".&lt;ref name=Lopez-Ibor&gt;{{vcite book |chapterurl=http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/18/04706947/0470694718-2.pdf |chapterformat=PDF |chapter=Religious experience and psychopathology |author=López-Ibor JJ Jr, López-Ibor Alcocer MI |pages=211–33 |title=Religion and Psychiatry: Beyond Boundaries |editor=Verhagen P, Van Praag HM, López-Ibor JJ Jr, Cox J, Moussaoui D, editors |isbn=978-0-470-69471-8 |publisher=Wiley |date=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loyola, Liguori, the French confessor [[R.P.

Studies in the mid-20th century reported that scrupulosity was a major problem among American Catholics, with up to 25&amp;nbsp;per cent of high school students affected; commentators at the time asserted that this was an increase over previous levels.&lt;ref name=Bourke/&gt;

Starting in the 20th century, individuals with scrupulosity in the U.S. and Britain increasingly began looking to psychiatrists, rather than to religious advisors, for help with the condition.&lt;ref name=Bourke&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Bourke J |title=Divine madness: the dilemma of religious scruples in twentieth-century America and Britain |journal=J Soc Hist |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=581–603 |date=2009 |doi=10.1353/jsh.0.0152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This part needs more work.--&gt;

== Characteristics ==

In scrupulosity, a person's obsessions focus on moral or religious fears, such as the fear of being an evil person or the fear of divine retribution for sin. Although it can affect nonreligious people, it is usually related to religious beliefs. In the strict sense, not all obsessive–compulsive behaviors related to religion are instances of scrupulosity: strictly speaking, for example, scrupulosity is not present in people who repeat religious requirements merely to be sure that they were done properly.&lt;ref name=Huppert&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Huppert JD, Siev J, Kushner ES |title=When religion and obsessive–compulsive disorder collide: treating scrupulosity in Ultra-Orthodox Jews |journal=J Clin Psychol |volume=63 |issue=10 |pages=925–41 |date=2007 |pmid=17828763 |doi=10.1002/jclp.20404 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==

Treatment is similar to that for other forms of obsessive–compulsive disorder.&lt;ref name=Abramowitz/&gt; [[Exposure and response prevention]] (ERP), a form of behavior therapy, is widely used for OCD in general and may be promising for scrupulosity in particular.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;&lt;ref name="linkinghub.elsevier.com"/&gt; ERP is based on the idea that deliberate repeated exposure to obsessional stimuli lessens anxiety, and that avoiding rituals lowers the urge to behave compulsively. For example, with ERP a person [[Intrusive thought#Blasphemous religious thoughts|obsessed by blasphemous thoughts]] while reading the Bible would practice reading the Bible.&lt;ref name=Abramowitz&gt;{{vcite book |editor=Abramowitz JS, McKay D, Taylor S |title=Clinical Handbook of Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder and Related Problems |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |date=2008 |isbn=0-8018-8697-X |chapter=Scrupulosity |author=Abramowitz JS |pages=156–72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Exposure Therapy for Anxiety: Principles and Practice|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pnoznH2c7esC|publisher = Guilford Press|date = 2011-03-14|isbn = 9781609180171|language = en|first = Jonathan S.|last = Abramowitz|first2 = Brett J.|last2 = Deacon|first3 = Stephen P. H.|last3 = Whiteside}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ERP is considerably harder to implement than with other disorders, because scrupulosity often involves spiritual issues that are not specific situations and objects. For example, ERP is not appropriate for a man obsessed by feelings that God has rejected and is punishing him. [[Cognitive therapy]] may be appropriate when ERP is not feasible.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt; Other therapy strategies include noting contradictions between the compulsive behaviors and moral or religious teachings, and informing individuals that for centuries religious figures have suggested strategies similar to ERP.&lt;ref name=Abramowitz/&gt; Religious counseling may be an additional way to readjust beliefs associated with the disorder, though it may also stimulate greater anxiety.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;

Little evidence is available on the use of medications to treat scrupulosity.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt; Although [[serotonergic]] medications are often used to treat OCD,&lt;ref name=Abramowitz/&gt; studies of pharmacologic treatment of scrupulosity in particular have produced so few results that even tentative recommendations cannot be made.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;

Treatment of scrupulosity in children has not been investigated to the extent it has been studied in adults, and one of the factors that makes the treatment difficult is the fine line the therapist must walk between engaging and offending the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |editor=McKay D, Storch EA, editors |date=2009 |title=Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Children: Treating Complex and Refractory Cases |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-8261-1686-8 |author=McKay D, Storch EA, Nelson B, Morales M, Moretz MW |chapter=Obsessive–compulsive disorder in children and adolescents: treating difficult cases |pages=81–114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==

The [[prevalence]] of scrupulosity is speculative. Available data do not permit reliable estimates, and available analyses mostly disregard associations with age or with gender, and have not reliably addressed associations with geography or ethnicity.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt; Available data suggest that the [[prevalence]] of obsessive–compulsive disorder does not differ by culture, except where prevalence rates differ for all psychiatric disorders. No association between OCD and depth of religious beliefs has been demonstrated, although data are scarce.&lt;ref name=Huppert/&gt; There are large regional differences in the percentage of OCD patients who have religious obsessions or compulsions, ranging from 0–7% in countries like the U.K. and Singapore, to 40–60% in traditional Muslim and orthodox Jewish populations.&lt;ref name=van-Megen/&gt;

{{Italic title}}
The '''''sikha''''' or '''''shikha''''' ({{lang-sa|शिखा}}; [[IAST]]: śikhā; "crest"; Hindi चोटी (choTi)) means flame, powerful, ray of light, peak of a mountain. It is a name of Hindu / Indian origin, and is commonly used for females. It also means long tuft, or [[lock of hair]], left on top or on the back of the shaven head of a male [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[Hindu]]. Though traditionally all [[Hindu]]s were required to wear a śikhā, today it is seen mainly among [[Brahmins]] and temple priests.West Bengal it is called Tiki.

==Procedure==
Traditionally, Hindu men shave off all their hair as a child in a [[sanskāra]] or ritual known as the [[chudakarama]]. A lock of hair is left at the crown ([[sahasrara]]).&lt;ref&gt;Daily Life In Ancient India, [[Jeannine Auboyer]], {{ISBN|1-84212-591-5}}, P. 164-5&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most other eastern cultures (including [[ancient Egypt]]) where a [[coming-of-age]] ceremony removed childhood locks of hair similar to the śikhā (e.g. a [[forelock]] or [[pigtail]]s in China, a [[Chonmage|topknot]] in Thailand, a sidelock in Egypt etc.) in India this prepubescent hairstyle is left to grow throughout the man's life, though usually only the most orthodox religious men will continue this hairstyle.

The śikhā is tied back or knotted to perform religious rites. Only funerals and death anniversaries are performed with the śikhā untied or with dishevelled hair. Dishevelled hair is considered inauspicious, and represents times of great sorrow or calamity. In Hindu scripture, [[Draupadi]] took an oath in the assembly of the [[Kuru Kingdom|Kuru]]s after she was molested by [[Dushasana]] that she would remain with dishevelled hair until the enemies were properly revenged. Similarly, [[Chanakya]] is said to have taken an oath to leave his ''śikhā'' untied until he humbles the [[Nanda]] kings who insulted him.

==Tamil Nadu and Kerala==
The [[Tamil language|Tamil]]word for śikhā is kudumi&lt;ref&gt;Converting women: gender and Protestant Christianity in colonial South India, Eliza F. Kent, Page 227&lt;/ref&gt; and traditionally it is represented in two styles. The most common kudumi (called '''Pin Kudumi''') is identical to the śikhā, with a knotted lock of hair on the crown of the head and the rest of the hair shaved off.

'''Mun-Kudumi''' is a style where the hair is grown long in the front and knotted to the forehead. This hairstyle was popular among some Brahmin groups of South India, such as the [[Chozhiya]], [[Dikshitar]], and [[Namboothiri]]s of Kerala. The prominent communities in Kerala including the ,Thiyyars, [[Nair]]s and temple servants ([[Ambalavasi]]), though not Brahmins, also sported this style.

The technique used to tie the hair into a Kudumi is as follows: The lengthy hair can be tied with the help of left thumb and index fingers. You roll up the lock of hair over the left thumb and index fingers put together by your right hand till you reach the tail end. Then hold the tail end of hair by the left thumb and index fingers and pull out the fingers with the tail end of the hair. You get the knot. After some little practice you will get a tight and neat knot.

==Maharashtra==
The [[Marathi language|Marathi]] word for śikhā is shendi.

==Hinduism==
The śikhā reportedly signifies one-pointed (''ekanta'') focus on a spiritual goal, and devotion to [[God]]. It is also an indication of cleanliness, as well as personal sacrifice to God. According to Smriti Shastras, it is mandatory for all [[Hindus]] to keep śikhā&lt;ref&gt;Bhāgavata Purāṇa 6.8.8&lt;/ref&gt; and the first three twice-born or dvija castes ([[brahmin]]s, [[kshatriya]]s and [[vaishya]]s) to wear yajnopavita ([[sacred thread]]), also called janeu, punool, or paita.&lt;ref&gt;Bhāgavata Purāṇa 6.19.7&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been said that the śikhā allows God to pull one to heaven, or at least from this material world of [[maya (illusion)]].

In his autobiography, [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]] writes about his encounter with an orthodox Hindu:

{{quote|He was pained to miss the shikha (tuft of hair) on my head and the sacred thread about my neck and said: 'It pains me to see you, a believing Hindu, going without a sacred thread and the shikha. These are the two external symbols of Hinduism and every Hindu ought to wear them.' ... [T]he shikha was considered obligatory by elders. On the eve of my going to England, however, I got rid of the shikha, lest when I was bareheaded it should expose me to ridicule and make me look, as I then thought, a barbarian in the eyes of the Englishmen. In fact this cowardly feeling carried me so far that in South Africa I got my cousin Chhaganlal Gandhi, who was religiously wearing the shikha, to do away with it. I feared that it might come in the way of his public work and so, even at the risk of paining him, I made him get rid of it.[[s:The Story of My Experiments with Truth/Part V/Lakshman Jhula|WikiSource]]}}

The śikhā was one of the few symbols of Hindus that transcended caste, language or regional barriers. Although there were variations of the style of sikha amongst communities, it was obligatory for all males.

==Similar hairstyles==
Hindus have a common belief that the śikhā "allows God to easily pull one to paradise".{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} While the śikhā has been known to exist in India for from as far back as Chanakya, some scholars have argued that this be an [[Islamic]], or at least an [[Arabian]] superstition, as the following passages may illustrate:

[[Sir Thomas Herbert, 1st Baronet]] (1606–1682) described a similar hairstyle worn by [[Persia]]ns in his book ''Travels in Persia'':

{{quote|The Persians allow no part of their body hair except the upper lip, which they wear long and thick and turning downwards; as also a lock upon the crown of the head, by which they are made to believe their Prophet will at Resurrection lift them into paradise. Elsewhere their head is shaven or made incapable of hair by the oil dowae (daway) being thrice anointed. This had been made the mode of the Oriental people since the promulgation of the alcoran (Al Quran), introduced and first imposed by the Arabians.|&lt;ref&gt;Travels in Persia, Sir Thomas Herbert, {{ISBN|978-0-415-34470-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In "Passages of Eastern Travel", [[Harper's magazine]], 1856, p.&amp;nbsp;197, an American traveller wrote:

{{quote|All Arabs, men and boys, have their heads shaved, leaving only a scalp lock, said by some to be left in imitation of the Prophet, who wore his own thus; and by others said to be for the convenience of the angel who will pull them out of the graves when the day of rising shall come.|&lt;ref&gt;Passages of Eastern Travel, Harper's magazine, 1856, p.197,&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Riffian people|Riffian]] ([[Berber people|Berber]]) men of [[Morocco]] had the custom of shaving the head but leaving a single [[lock of hair]] on either the crown, left, or right side of the head, so that the angel [[Azrael]] is able "...to pull them up to heaven on the Last Day."&lt;ref&gt;El Maghreg: 1200 Miles' Ride Through Morocco, Hugh Edward Millington Stutfield&lt;/ref&gt;

High-born Chamorri men of the indigenous [[Chamorro people]] of the [[Mariana Islands]] also wore a hairstyle similar to the śikhā.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Chamorro society, Lawrence J. Cunningham, {{ISBN|978-1-880188-05-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see statues of Chief [[Gadao]] or [[Chief Quipuha]] in [[Chief Quipuha Park]], Paseo de Susana peninsula, Agana, Guam.)
Later, particularly on the island of [[Guam]], this śikhā-like top-knot hairstyle became somewhat of a political statement for young men:&lt;ref&gt;Shifting images of identity in the Pacific, Toon van Meijl, Jelle Miedema, {{ISBN|978-90-6718-244-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In the late 1980s, early 1990s there was a resurgence of the top-knot hair style. One of our senators now, before he became a 'certified' politician, was sort of a radical activist. He first he started out with a group called the Chamorro Che‘lu’s. Che‘lu means 'brother' or 'sister,' but his group, they were all young men, and really macho. They all had their hair cut to have a top-knot. And that fueled a debate: 'Do I have to have a top-knot in order to be a Chamorro?' Some guys would wear their hair long and you wouldn't know it was a top-knot until they pulled it up and you could see that they shaved the whole underpart. It was really threatening, and made some people really nervous. But the fact that such people are now senators and they tend to get a lot of votes, that's a sign to me that people are really taking issues of culture a lot more seriously, at least the grass roots population.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacificworlds.com/guam/onwards/commun.cfm |title=Guam: Inarajan - Onwards: Community |publisher=Pacificworlds.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another śikhā-like hairstyle existed in eastern Europe. [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] reportedly wore a scalplock, similar to the śikhā, to signify his 'noble birth'.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Heath "The Vikings (Elite 3)", Osprey Publishing 1985; {{ISBN|978-0-85045-565-6}}, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Nicolle "Armies of Medieval Russia 750–1250 (Men-at-Arms 333)" Osprey Publishing 1999; {{ISBN|978-1-85532-848-8}}, p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[oseledets]], or [[khokhol]] hairstyle of the [[Ukrainian Cossacks]], or [[Zaporozhians]], was quite similar to the śikhā,&lt;ref&gt;Vernadsky 276–277.&lt;/ref&gt; although it may sometimes have been situated not at the crown, but towards the front of the head. Indeed, another Ukrainian word for this particular hairstyle is чуприна, [[chupryna]] meaning 'forelock'.&lt;ref name="Natalie O. Kononenko page 308"&gt;Ukrainian minstrels: and the blind shall sing, Natalie O. Kononenko, page 308&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, Zaporozhians would grow their scalplocks to provide "...a handle by which the enemy could carry a Cossack's head, should he succeed in severing it."&lt;ref name="Natalie O. Kononenko page 308"/&gt;

A stone head discovered at the Neolithic site of [[Nevalı Çori]] in Anatolia features what some have interpreted as an early example of a śikhā, perhaps the mark of a priest or shaman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veda.harekrsna.cz/connections/Western-Asia.php |title=Western Asia |publisher=Veda.harekrsna.cz |date=2000-02-27 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The scalplock of many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes (particularly of the eastern woodlands, such as the [[Wyandot people|Huron]]) is very similar in appearance to the śikhā,&lt;ref&gt;A Pictorial History of The American Indian, Oliver La Farge, {{ISBN|978-0-517-01695-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; although like the Cossack oseledets, a much different meaning was applied to this hairstyle compared to the Hindu śikhā.

The śikhā may also be referred to as 'choti', 'kudumi' or 'chuda'. It should not be confused with the [[rattail (haircut)]] nor the [[Mullet (haircut)|mullet]] hairstyle, both popularized in the 1980s in the West.

In Hinduism though, the Sikha has been worn by the temple priests of Jagannath Puri and Tirumala Balaji temples for 2000 years and therefore predate Islam. It is more believable that this belief of the sikha was taken from India along the silk road by Mohammedan followers. Muslims now do not wear a sikha but a Mohammedan beard instead.

'''Superintendent''' is the head of an administrative division of a [[Protestantism|Protestant church]], largely historical but still in use in Germany. It replaced the title of bishop in Northern Germany and Scandinavia after the [[Protestant Reformation]], since ''bishop'' was associated with [[Roman Catholicism]]. Later, the title was adopted to describe clerical positions in the hierarchy of [[Methodist]] churches.

==Lutheran usage==
===Sweden===
Superintendents were created in [[Sweden]] after the [[Protestant Reformation#Scandinavia|Protestant Reformation]]. The office was similar to that of [[bishop]], but instead of being [[ordination|ordained]] by the [[archbishop]], the superintendent was appointed by the Crown. This new model of [[ecclesiastical polity]] was partly political, as the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] bishops before the Reformation held considerable political power and often used it against the king. Superintendents' loyalty was supposed to lie with the head of the new [[Church of Sweden]], the monarch. Some [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[theology|theologians]] also considered the term less [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and therefore preferable to 'bishop'.

In Sweden proper, the following dioceses have been governed by a superintendent:

* [[Diocese of Kalmar]] (1603–1678, thereafter presided by a bishop till 1915, when merged with the [[diocese of Växjö]].
* [[Diocese of Gothenburg|Diocese of Göteborg]] (1620–1665, thereafter presided by a bishop)
* [[Diocese of Visby]] (1645–1772, thereafter presided by a bishop)
* [[Diocese of Mariestad]] (1583–1646, superintendent moved to Karlstad and Mariestad absorbed into the [[diocese of Skara]])
* [[Diocese of Karlstad]] (1647–1772, superintendent moved from Mariestad; presided by a bishop since 1772)
* [[Diocese of Härnösand]] (1647–1772, thereafter presided by a bishop)

The [[diocese of Lund]] was equally administered by superintendents from 1537 to 1637, but was at that time part of [[Denmark]].

===Baltic states===
The Church of Sweden's organisation in the [[Baltic region|Baltic provinces]] were created by similar provisions. [[Livonia]] came under a superintendent in 1622 and a superintendent-general from 1678. Superintendents were also appointed to [[Ingria]] in 1641 and to [[Saaremaa]] in 1650; a superintendent was also appointed to [[Estonia]] for a shorter period, probably 1622-1638, as well as to [[Riga]] and [[Tallinn|Reval]].

===German-speaking Europe===
In 1652 the general government of Swedish [[Bremen-Verden]] introduced a [[Consistory (Lutheranism)|Consistory]], led by a General Superintendent, for this German territory of [[Imperial immediacy]].

In 1535 the [[Estates of the Realm|Estates]] of the [[Land of Hadeln]] introduced a consistory, led by a General Superintendent.

The [[Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover]] used to maintain several consistories until 1922, each led by a General Superintendent.

In the [[Electorate of Brandenburg]] the title General Superintendent was used until 1632. In the years since 1817 during the constitutional reforms of the [[Evangelical Church in Prussia]], including the then ''March of Brandenburg'' provincial subsection, the title General Superintendent was reintroduced in 1828, with each general superintendency ({{lang-de|Generalsuperintendentur}}) supervising a number of deaneries. The title superintendent referred to the head of a [[deanery]].

In the [[Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia]], a successor church body of the former, the term Superintendent refers to the head of a [[deanery]] ({{lang-de|Kirchenkreis}}). The term General Superintendent refers to the each head of one of the three regions ({{lang-de|Sprengel}}), each comprising several deaneries.

===Slovenia===
From 1561 to 1564 [[Primož Trubar]] was superintendent of Slovenian Protestant church in Ljubljana (Laibach).

== Methodist usage ==
{{Further|General Superintendent (Church of the Nazarene)|District Superintendent (United Methodist Church)}}

The term "Superintendent" is used for several varying positions in Methodism worldwide. In the American sense, specifically within the [[United Methodist Church]], the title is used not to refer to a minister who is equivalent to a [[Bishop (United Methodist)|bishop]] but to the supervisor of a district, which is a regional subdivision below an [[episocopal area]] (equivalent to a [[diocese]]). According to the ''[[Book of Discipline (United Methodist)|Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church]]'', {{cquote|The offices of ''[[bishop]]'' and ''district superintendent'' exist in The United Methodist Church as particular ministries. Bishops are elected and district superintendents are appointed from the group of [[Elder (Methodism)|elders]] who are ordained to be ministers of [[Holy Bible|Word]], [[Sacrament]], and [[Holy Orders#Methodist churches|Order]] and thereby participate in the ministry of Christ, in sharing a royal priesthood which has apostolic roots ([[First Epistle of Peter|I Peter]] 2:9; [[Gospel of John|John]] 21:15-17; [[Acts 20:28]]; [[First Epistle of Peter|I Peter]] 5:2-3; [[First Epistle to Timothy|I Timothy]] 3:1-7).&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church 2008'': Chapter Three. The Superintendency. Section II. Offices of Bishop and District Superintendent - ¶ 402. ''Special Ministry, Not Separate Order''(retrieved 10 October 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the [[British Methodist Church]] and its offshoots, a Superintendent is a minister who serves in a supervisory position over a [[Methodist Circuit]] (a small group of churches to which ministers are appointed).

The term Superintendent evolved in Britain before the death of Methodist founder [[John Wesley]] and was a description of the responsibilities of some of his Assistants (a role which later evolved into what is now known as ordained [[presbyter]]al ministry).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=What is a Circuit Superintendent?|date=2005|publisher=The Methodist Conference|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Egyptian Dynasty list}}
While not regarded as a dynasty, the [[High Priests of Amun]] at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] were nevertheless of such power and influence that they were effectively the rulers of [[Upper Egypt]] from 1080 to c. 943 BC, after which their influence declined. By the time Herihor was proclaimed as the first ruling High Priest of Amun in 1080 BC—in the 19th Year of [[Ramesses XI]]—the Amun priesthood exercised an effective stranglehold on Egypt's economy. The Amun priests owned two-thirds of all the [[Egyptian temple|temple]] lands in Egypt and 90 percent of her ships plus many other resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clayton|first=Peter A.|authorlink=Peter A. Clayton|title=Chronicle of the Pharaohs: The Reign-by-Reign Record of the Rulers and Dynasties of Ancient Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QeCDGwAACAAJ|year=2006|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn=978-0-500-28628-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the Amun priests were as powerful as the Pharaoh, if not more so. One of the sons of the High Priest Pinedjem I would eventually assume the throne and rule Egypt for almost half a decade as pharaoh [[Psusennes I]], while the Theban High Priest Psusennes III would take the throne as king [[Psusennes II]], the final ruler of the [[Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt]].

==The High Priests==

* [[Pinedjem II]],  Son of Menkheperre and Isetemkheb III. Followed his brother Nesibanebdjedet II as high priest of Amun.
* [[Psusennes III]]

===22nd Dynasty===
* [[Iuput]], Son of [[Shoshenq I]] high priest of Amun for most of his father’s reign, and into the reign of his brother [[Osorkon I]]. 944–924 BC
* [[Shoshenq C]] (possibly identical to [[Sheshonk II]]), Son of [[Osorkon I]] and [[Maatkare B]]. Served as high priest of Amun at Karnak for large part of his father’s reign.
* [[Iuwlot]], Son of [[Osorkon I]]. Probably became high priest of Amun late in the reign of [[Osorkon I]] and served until the early years of [[Takelot I]]. 
* Nesibanebdjedet III ([[Smendes III]]), Son of Osorkon I. Served as high priest of Amun during the middle of the reign of his brother [[Takelot I]]. 
* [[Harsiese B]], Son of Soshenq II. Promoted to high priest of Amun under [[Osorkon II]]. 874–860 BC
* [[Nimlot C]], Son of Osorkon II. Became high priest of Amun after year 16 . The name of his predecessor […du/aw…] was erased. 855–845 BC
* Takelot F (see [[Takelot II]]). Son of Nimlot III. Followed his father as high priest of Amun before probably becoming a Theban King as [[Takelot II]]. 845–840 BC
* Osorkon B (see [[Osorkon III]]). Eldest son of Takelot II. Probably became high priest of Amun after his father assumed kingship. 840–785 BC. Later took the throne as [[Osorkon III]].
* Osorkon F, probably son of Rudamun and grandson of Osorkon III?
* Harsiese, son of […du/aw…] i.e. Pedubast? 835–800 BC.

Hindu priests have on occasion given opening prayers in Congress since then. A 2007 [[Chaplain of the United States Senate#Opening prayer|Senate opening prayer]] led by Rajan Zed of [[Reno, Nevada]], was criticized in advance by the [[American Family Association]], and protesters interrupted the prayer from the Senate gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19729245/ns/politics/t/hindu-prayer-senate-disrupted Hindu prayer in Senate disrupted]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 [[Tulsi Gabbard]] of Hawaii became the first Hindu member of Congress.

==Prayer==
Under the rules of the [[United States House of Representatives]], a member can invite a guest [[Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives|chaplain]] once per term in Congress. Representative [[Sherrod Brown]] of Ohio invited Samuldrala to offer the opening prayer on September 14, 2000, to coincide with an address to a joint session of Congress by the Prime Minister of India [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]].

Samuldrala opened the House's day with the following prayer: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
O God, You are Omnipresent, Omnipotent, and Omniscient. You are in everything and nothing is beyond You. You are our Mother and Father and we are all Your children. Whatever You do is for our good. You are the ocean of mercy and You forgive our errors. You are our teacher and You guide us into righteousness.

Today, in this great Hall, are assembled the elected Representatives of the people of the Nation. They are ready to perform their duties. God, please guide them in their thoughts and actions so they can achieve the greatest good of all.

We end this invocation with a prayer from the ancient scriptures of India: 
:May all be happy
:May all be free from disease
:May all realize what is good
:May none be subject to misery

After the prayer, Rep. Brown made the following statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Today is a great day for Indian-American relations. For the first time, a Hindu priest has given the opening prayer at a session of Congress, and the Prime Minister of India [Atal Bihari Vajpayee] later this morning will address a joint session of Congress... The United States is also home to an Indian-American community of 1.4 million people. I requested the House Chaplain and Speaker to invite Mr. Samuldrala to give today's prayer as a testimony to the religious diversity that is the hallmark of our great nation.

I want to thank Mr. Samuldrala for his thoughtful prayer that reminds us that, while we may differ in culture and traditions, we are all alike in the most basic aspiration of peace and righteousness.

I thank the House Chaplain for inviting Mr. Samuldrala and look forward to the future efforts to strengthen the bonds between our two great nations.&lt;ref name="H7579"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Family Research Council response==
On September 21, 2000 the [[Family Research Council]] (FRC) published a response to the prayer on their website and in mailings of their weekly newsletter. In the FRC's article "Religious Pluralism or Tolerance?", Robert Regier and Timothy Dailey said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A Hindu priest was recently invited to give the opening invocation in the House of Representatives. What's wrong with this?

What's wrong is that it is one more indication that our nation is drifting from its Judeo-Christian roots...Alas, in our day, when 'tolerance' and 'diversity' have replaced the 10 Commandments as the only remaining absolute dictums, it has become necessary to 'celebrate' non-Christian religions – even in the halls of Congress...Our founders expected that Christianity – and no other religion – would receive support from the government as long as that support did not violate people's consciences and their right to worship. They would have found utterly incredible the idea that all religions, including paganism, be treated with equal deference. Many people today confuse traditional Western religious tolerance with religious pluralism. The former embraces biblical truth while allowing for freedom of conscience, while the latter assumes all religions are equally valid, resulting in  moral relativism and ethical chaos...&lt;ref name="RT"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And further stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As for our Hindu priest friend, the United States is a nation that has historically honored the One True God. Woe be to us on that day when we relegate Him to being merely one among countless other deities in the pantheon of theologies.&lt;ref name="Abrams"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Hinduism/2000/09/Hindu-Prayer-In-Congress-Criticized.aspx#ixzz1PBptGCpE|publisher=Associated Press|title=Hindu Prayer in Congress Criticized|date=September 21, 2000|author=Jim Abrams}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aftermath of the FRC response==
In response to news media reporting the FRC's response, Rep. Brown's spokesperson said that it is "unfortunate that the Family Research Council interprets the Constitution to say that religious freedom means Christian supremacy".&lt;ref name="RT"/&gt; Brown personally responded to the FRC statement, saying "I'm disappointed the Family Research Council doesn't understand what this country is all about. This country was founded on freedom of religion and religious diversity." He said their comments were "bigotry, plain and simple".&lt;ref name="Church"&gt;{{cite news|title=Invocation Intolerance: Hindu Priest's Prayer Before U.S. House Sparks Outbreak Of Bigotry At Family Research Council|date=November 2000|author=Steve Benen|url=http://www.au.org/church-state/november-2000-church-state/featured/invocation-intolerance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverend [[Barry W. Lynn]], executive director of [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]], said the FRC's statement "reeks of religious bigotry...[showing a] remarkable lack of respect for religious diversity".&lt;ref name="Abrams"/&gt; He also said, "It is truly rare, even within the Religious Right, to see a group display simultaneously such a poor understanding of history and a remarkable lack of respect for religious diversity. Usually such profound ignorance like this is commonly found in the 18th, not the 21st century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congress' Hindu Blessing|publisher=Hinduism Today|url=http://www.hinduism-today.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?com_mode=flat&amp;com_order=0&amp;itemid=4019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the FRC's comments were reported by the [[Associated Press]], the original critical article was removed from the FRC website; and Kristin Hansen, an FRC spokesperson, told reporters that "the piece had not been approved by FRC officials and was published accidentally".&lt;ref name="Church"/&gt; Chuck Donovan, the Executive Vice President of the FRC, issued a press release on September 22, 2000, which said, "It is the position of the Family Research Council that governments must respect freedom of conscience for all people in religious matters ... We affirm the truth of Christianity, but it is not our position that American's{{sic}} Constitution forbids representatives of religions other than Christianity from praying before Congress." Donovan also decried secularization in the American culture, pointed out his group's support for religious freedom legislation. Donovan also wrote against the persecution of Christians across the globe, calling on India to protect the Christian minority there just as the United States insures the rights of the American Hindu minority.&lt;ref name="RT"/&gt;

==Timothy Lamer article==
The issue continued to resonate among the [[Christian right]], which led author, and managing editor of the Christian magazine ''[[World (magazine)|World]]'', Timothy Lamer to publish an essay on October 7, 2000, entitled "Spiritual adultery - A case of infidelity in the public square". He began it by stating that "the U.S. House and Senate basically bowed down to [[Baal]]". He went on to say "the event showcased everything that is wrong, from an evangelical perspective, with the congressional chaplaincy in particular and [[civil religion]] in general". He called for evangelicals "who have fought so hard for a resurgence of civil religion" to demand that legislators who attended the "officially sanctioned Hindu prayer in the halls of Congress" be "call[ed] to repentance and, if he doesn't repent, [[excommunicate]] him".

&lt;blockquote&gt;
God's Word teaches that a Christian who bows down to a false god—or takes part in a prayer that denies Christ—is engaged in spiritual adultery, which is every bit as serious as physical [[adultery]]. Christ demands our exclusive spiritual allegiance, and the church must not tolerate violations of the first two commandments among its members.&lt;ref name=Lamer2000&gt;{{cite web|title=Spiritual adultery: A case of infidelity in the public square|author=Timothy Lamer|publisher=God's World Publications|url=http://www.worldmag.com/articles/4339|date=October 7, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lamer postulated that "another response is appropriate: Perhaps Mr. Samuldrala's invocation will cause evangelicals to rethink their devotion to civil religion. As the United States increasingly becomes a gigantic [[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]] of false religions, it will become more difficult every year for Christians to see religion in the public square as a good thing."

Lamer held that a denial of what he saw as basic Christian doctrine among "nominal Christians in theologically liberal churches" had fully detached them from Christianity, thus making actual Christians a minority, but that this is no surprise in light of Matthew 7:13-14. With this in mind he stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nor should we be surprised that an unchristian{{sic}} majority would reserve an honored place for untruth in its civil religion. A Hindu invocation is only an extreme version of this habit. Other forms of civil religion routinely are calculated to be inoffensive to those who deny Christ....Polite universalism is America's civil religion, and it is an absolute enemy of the gospel. It assumes that those who are not in Christ are on good terms with God—a lie, according to the Bible.&lt;ref name=Lamer2000/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lamer warned Christians that they should "Get ready for Mormons, Muslims, New Age shamans, and, with the rise of Wicca, even Wiccans leading congressmen in prayer on the floor of the House." He therefore called for a reconsideration in evangelical policy regarding their support of legislative chaplains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We could recognize that under the new covenant, civil government doesn't have authority over spiritual matters, and that legislatures shouldn't have chaplains. (For centuries some evangelicals, such as Baptists, made this argument.) We also could recognize that civil religion, by affirming unbelievers in their unbelief, hinders the spread of the gospel. Or evangelicals could continue to fight for symbolic civil religion. But, increasingly, the result of their effort will be a [[golden calf]] in America's pluralistic public square. How will they react? If Mr. Samuldrala's invocation is any indication, they will silently bow and not make waves, for the sake of having religion—any religion, even soul-destroying religion—in the public square."&lt;ref name=Lamer2000/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Responses to Lamer article==

===Neuhaus===
[[Richard John Neuhaus]] pointed out that Lamer's position in ''World'' was in contrast to another article entitled "Genuine pluralism" in the same issue, by [[James Skillen]] of the [[Center for Public Justice]], who held that "most Americans are not convinced that secularizing the public square is the way to do justice to diverse faiths", and that the government should "make room for all faiths—both religious and secular—without giving a privileged position to any of them....The United States is not a Jewish state or a Catholic state; not a Protestant state or Muslim state. And it certainly should not be a secularized state."&lt;ref name=Neuhaus2001&gt;{{cite journal |last=Neuhaus |first=Richard John |authorlink=Richard John Neuhaus |title=As the New Millennium Begins |url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2001/03/as-the-new-millennium-begins |journal=[[First Things]] |date=March 2001 |accessdate=September 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neuhaus noted that "Skillen thinks the chaplaincy program in the military, government support for faith-based social services, and parental choice in education are indicative of the ways to go in a pluralistic society." He agreed with Skillen and maintained that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mr. Lamer is wrong, I think, to claim that bowing one's head in respect means that one is joining in a prayer to Hindu gods. Presumably Christian legislators, if they were praying, were praying to the God and Father of Jesus Christ....I would recast the ''World'' debate to argue that it is precisely because of the Judeo-Christian ethic that the public square should be hospitable to all faiths. Because, first, we do not sacralize the public square, mistaking it for the Church. And, second, because we recognize that all people, whatever their religious or other errors, are made in the image of God and therefore bearers of a human dignity that demands our respect. The Lamer-Skillen exchange usefully poses questions about which all Christians need greater clarity.&lt;ref name=Neuhaus2001/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Marty===
Among the voices responding to Lamer's article was [[Martin E. Marty]] who, while apparently disagreeing with much of Lamer's view, applauded him for calling for a more serious examination of the issue of civil religion, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...he is struggling with a genuine issue, offering an alert to which observers of American religion should pay close attention. Lamer's editorial is a 'distant early warning' signal of the sort we hear and read ever more frequently: not all evangelicals – the camp that has agitated most for school prayer, football-game invocations, and legislative chaplains – are pleased with the bargain they'll be getting in a richly pluralist America....Lamer may do a disservice to civil religion, chaplains, tolerance, amity, and public-prayer advocates. He does a service to those who want more serious second-thinking about what exactly comes with public worship in a society condemned to be diverse.&lt;ref name="Marty"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Raden Report===
The Christian authors of "The Raden Report" in an article titled "Religion and Politics Can't Mix" agreed with Lamer's position but took him to task for not realizing that the full-time Chaplain of the House was a Roman Catholic (the guest chaplain a week before Samuldrala had been the first Catholic nun in the post&lt;ref name="Abrams"/&gt;). The authors of "The Raden Report" maintained that recent statements of the Roman Catholic Church downplayed Christianity's traditional claim that belief in Jesus is necessary to achieve an afterlife of eternal bliss.
They sought to point out to Lamer and like-minded readers that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
F.Y.I... Roman Catholic priest [[Daniel Coughlin]] is the official chaplain for the US House of Representatives, a position funded annually by tax payers to the tune of $138,000.00. Of course, as a Roman Catholic priest, Mr. Coughlin must uphold official declarations from the Vatican.

&lt;center&gt;Pope says some can be saved without faith in Jesus...&lt;/center&gt;

Related to this issue of Hindu prayers, a recent Vatican document, ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'', says 'various religious traditions contain and offer religious elements which come from God... Indeed some prayers and rituals of the other religions may assume a role of preparation of the Gospel....' Shocking? Only if you are unfamiliar with Roman Catholicism’s pursuit of ecumenical and interreligious dialogue over the past 35 years.

And if that heresy isn't clear enough, earlier this month the Pope restated his position, saying that among the saved are 'All who seek God with a sincere heart, including those who do not know Christ and his church.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Religion and Politics Can't Mix: The Raden Report  |url=http://www.cephasministry.com/evangelists_colson_and_ext.html |date=December 18, 2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060918220441/http://cephasministry.com/evangelists_colson_and_ext.html |archive-date=September 18, 2006 |accessdate=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Rajan Zed prayer==
{{Main|Rajan Zed prayer protest}}
In 2007, after it was announced that Hindu cleric Rajan Zed would be the first to offer a Hindu prayer to the United States Senate, [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] (AU) recalled the controversy over Samuldrala and called on the Family Research Council (FRC) to live up to its statement of 2000, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now the FRC gets a chance to really make amends. We challenge the group to issue a public statement affirming religious diversity in America and welcoming Hindus to our rich tapestry of faiths. If we must have such prayers before Congress, they should respect religious diversity. Surely the FRC has no problem with that?&lt;ref name="Previous"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/senprayer07a.htm|title=Previous Hindu prayer in the House; Opposition prior to the Senate prayer |publisher=ReligiousTolerance.Org |accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The FRC made no response.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

A '''weeping statue''' is a [[statue]] which has been claimed  to have shed [[tears]] or to be weeping by supernatural means. Statues weeping tears which appear to be blood, oil, and scented liquids have all been reported. Other claimed phenomena are sometimes associated with weeping statues such as miraculous healing, the formation of figures in the tear lines, and the scent of roses. These events are generally reported by some [[Christian]]s, and initially attract some pilgrims, but are in most cases disallowed by the Church as proven hoaxes.

==Weeping statue and Marian apparition ==
[[File:Virgin Mary of Akita Japan.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The weeping statue of [[Our Lady of Akita]] apparitions in [[Japan]].]]
Reported weeping statues are most often of the [[BVM(RC)|Virgin Mary]] and are at times accompanied by claims of [[Marian apparition]]s. An unusual nature of the [[Our Lady of Akita]] apparitions was that unlike other cases the entire nation of Japan was able to view the tears of the statue of the [[BVM(RC)|Virgin Mary]] on national television.&lt;ref&gt;''The Everything Mary Book: The Life and Legacy of the Blessed Mother'' by Jenny Schroedel, John Schroedel 2006 {{ISBN|1-59337-713-4}} page 137-138&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hoaxes and skepticism==
Authorities of the Catholic Church have been very careful in their approach and treatment of weeping statues, and generally set very high barriers for their acceptance.
For instance when a statue of the popular Saint [[Padre Pio|Padre Pio of Pietrelcina]] in [[Messina]], [[Sicily]], was found to have tears of blood one day in 2002, Church officials quickly ordered tests that showed the blood belonged to a woman and then dismissed the case as a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1858430.stm Weeping statue of Padre Pio]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article1081044.ece Church rules out Padre Pio tears]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Skeptics point to the fact that making a fake weeping statue is relatively easy. At some skeptic conferences, "do it yourself weeping statue kits" are on sale. Skeptics have provided examples of weeping statues that have been obvious [[hoax]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randi.org/jr/042304seven.html Hoaxes exposed]&lt;/ref&gt;

Weeping statues have also been dismissed by [[rationalism|rationalists]] as a purely psychological and/or [[fraud]]ulent phenomenon. The witnesses are said to be deluded by their own state of mind or strong group suggestion. In this altered state of mind, they believe they see something that isn't really there.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]]. (1993). ''Looking for a Miracle: Weeping Icons, Relics, Stigmata, Visions &amp; Healing Cures''. [[Prometheus Books]]. pp. 56-57. {{ISBN|1-57392-680-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another likely explanation attributes the so-called tears to condensation. The tears that statues appear to weep are actually beads of condensation accounted for by the statue being made from material of varying density, with condensation forming on the denser (colder) pieces (in this case the eyes). 

A number of weeping statues have been declared fake by Catholic church officials.&lt;ref&gt;YouTube on fake statue [www.youtube.com/watch?v=57e9OMZlghY]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/04-07-30.html Fake statues]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.undeceivingourselves.com/I-enou.htm |title=Fake Rockingham statue |access-date=2008-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719063214/http://www.undeceivingourselves.com/I-enou.htm |archive-date=2008-07-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/02/26/1046064105171.html  Fake Statue article]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1995, a Madonna statue appeared to weep blood in the town of [[Civitavecchia]] in Italy. About 60 witnesses testified to witnessing the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/dec/09/weekend7.weekend1 The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt; The local bishop said that he himself had seen it weep. The blood on the statue was later found to be male. The statue’s owner, Fabio Gregori, refused to take a DNA test. After the Civitavecchia case, dozens of reputedly miraculous statues were reported.  Almost all were shown to be hoaxes, where blood, red paint, or water was splashed on the faces of the statues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=12436 Catholic News on Fake Weeping Statue]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, church custodian Vincenzo Di Costanzo went on trial in northern Italy for faking blood on a statue of the Virgin Mary when his own DNA was matched to the blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.italymag.co.uk/italy/religion/weeping-madonna-trial-opens |title=Court Trial for Fake Statue |access-date=2008-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517090724/http://www.italymag.co.uk/italy/religion/weeping-madonna-trial-opens |archive-date=2008-05-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, at the Our Lady Guadalupe Catholic Church in Hobbs, New Mexico, a Mary statue was reported to be producing tears. In July of that year, the Catholic Diocese of Las Cruces revealed that tests confirmed the tears in fact '''had the chemical composition of rose scented olive oil.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Radford |first1=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Radford|title=Small Town Virgin Mary 'Miracle': Olive Oil |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=September-October 2018 |volume=42 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eye"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nickell |first1=Joe |authorlink=Joe Nickell|title=Weeping-Eye Cons |url=https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/weeping-eye-cons/ |website=Center for Inquiry |publisher=CFI |accessdate=24 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025030110/https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/weeping-eye-cons/ |archivedate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of weeping statues==

[[Plutarch]], in chapter 38 of his Life of [[Coriolanus]], discusses the phenomenon of weeping and bleeding statues, with special reference to the case of a statue of [[Fortuna]] addressing a crowd in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Coriolanus*.html]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Joe Nickell]], "animated ones", or inanimate objects that are claimed to do things such as walking, changing facial expressions, or shedding tears, are most commonly statues in the Roman Catholic tradition.&lt;ref name="Eye"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the canonical Catholic book of [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] Chapter 14 verses 1-21 the story finds Daniel setting up a trap to catch priests who were sneaking into temples to eat the offerings left at the feet of the idol [[Belenus|Bel]], which was worshipped for its seeming ability to consume food and drink.&lt;ref name="Eye"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A very small number of weeping statues have been recognized by the Roman Catholic Church, e.g. in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] the shedding of tears from a statue in the house of a married couple (August 29, 1953) was recognized by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Siracusa|Catholic bishops of Sicily]] on December 13, 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Sicily statues Bäumer Marienlexikon, p.398&lt;/ref&gt; [[Our Lady of Akita]] was declared as worthy of belief by the [[Holy Office]] in 1988, and remains the only weeping statue recognized by the [[Holy Office]].

The following is a list of the more publicized claims. The veracity of these claims is difficult to establish and many have been declared hoaxes by Church officials.

==Weeping paintings==
Weeping [[painting]]s or [[icon]]s are a related phenomenon, but to date not a single case of a weeping painting has been approved either by the Roman Catholic or Coptic churches and most instances have turned out to be hoaxes. However, in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], some cases such as a weeping [[St Michael]] icon in [[Rhodes]] have been taken as miraculous. [http://www.johnsanidopoulos.com]

As with weeping statues, the tears exuded are often said to be of a substance which appears to be similar to blood. A painting of the Virgin Mary is said to have exuded moisture from the eyes and the fingers at St. Nicholas Albanian Orthodox Church in [[Chicago]] on December 6, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Rotzoll, Brenda Warner. (2001-07-15) "Other images have captured attention". ''[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The event gained international attention and drew many onlookers to the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = David K. | last = Fremon | title = Chicago Politics, Ward by Ward | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VegZ4NF-7KEC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=%22St.+Nicholas+Albanian+Orthodox+Church%22+Mary&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U0e5oJRf0EZ0jMJ_7_i1JWJMH0U3w | publisher = Indian University Press | year = 1988 | ISBN = 0-253-31344-9 | page = 237}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The moisture ceased in July 1987, but resumed a year later at which time 19 other icons were said to have also started weeping after being "anointed" with the painting's moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Mark | last = Moran |author2=Troy Taylor |author3=Mark Sceurman | title = Weird Illinois: Your Travel Guide to Illinois' Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gE4P1bhDCB4C&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=%22St.+Nicholas+Albanian+Orthodox+Church%22+Mary&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U00Kkvd0kPnRfpBqYJyNOwdr0r-gw#PPA68,M1 | publisher = Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-7607-5943-X | page = 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; A painting of Mary on plywood was said to have wept on March 10, 1992 in [[Barberton, Ohio|Barberton]], [[Ohio]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Jerome | last=Pohlen | title = Oddball Ohio: A Guide to Some Really Strange Places | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VsOptGbINbMC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22Roman+Bernard%22+Mary&amp;sig=ACfU3U2xiWfuxcrec3IA7v9vNVPXEPf19Q | page = 59 | publisher = Chicago Review Press | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-55652-523-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; annual pilgrimages celebrating the event were still in practice as late as 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Colette M.
