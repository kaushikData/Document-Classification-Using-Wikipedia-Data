The '''1953 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race''', was the 9th annual running of the "blue water classic" [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]].

Hosted by the [[Cruising Yacht Club of Australia]] based in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], the 1953 edition began on [[Sydney Harbour]], at [[Noon]] on [[Boxing Day]] (26 December 1953), before heading south for 630 nautical miles (1,170&amp;nbsp;km) through the [[Tasman Sea]], past [[Bass Strait]], into [[Storm Bay]] and up the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|River Derwent]], to cross the finish line in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]].

The 1953 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race comprised a fleet of 23 competitors, the largest ever at the time. Line-honours were awarded to ''Solveig,'' the Australian racer custom-built of the rare Tasmanian wood [[Huon Pine]] in Sydney by the Norwegian Halvorsen family and skippered by T &amp; M Halvorsen. ''Solveig'' won in the time of 5 days, 7 hours and 12 minutes. ''Solveig'' is yet today a sound vessel, lying Honolulu, Hawaii, U.S.A.. ''Ripple'', skippered by R. C. Hobson, was awarded handicap honours on adjusted time using the [[International Measurement System]] (IMS).''

{{2010 Commonwealth Games}}

The '''2010 Commonwealth Games''', officially known as the '''XIX Commonwealth Games''' and commonly known as '''Delhi 2010''', was an international [[multi-sport event]] that was held in [[Delhi]], [[India]], from 3 to 14 October 2010. A total of 6081 athletes from 71 [[The Commonwealth|Commonwealth nations and dependencies]] competed in 21 sports and 272 events, making it the largest [[Commonwealth Games]] to date. It was also the largest international [[multi-sport event]] to be staged in Delhi and India, eclipsing the [[Asian Games]] in [[1951 Asian Games|1951]] and [[1982 Asian Games|1982]]. The [[2010 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony|opening]] and [[2010 Commonwealth Games closing ceremony|closing]] ceremonies were held at the [[Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium]], the main stadium of the event.

It was the first time that the Commonwealth Games were held in India and the second time they were held in Asia after [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia in [[1998 Commonwealth Games|1998]]. It was also the first time a [[Republics in the Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth Republic]] hosted the games, second in a country not presently headed by British monarch since Malaysia in 1998. The official mascot of the Games was ''[[Shera (mascot)|Shera]]'' and the official song of the Games, "[[Jiyo Utho Bado Jeeto]]", was composed by [[81st Academy Awards|Academy]] and [[51st Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy]] awardee Indian recording artist [[A.R. Rahman]].

Preparation for the Games received widespread international media attention, with criticism being levelled against the organisers for the [[Concerns and controversies over the 2010 Commonwealth Games|slow pace of work]], as well as issues related to security and hygiene. However, all member nations of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] participated in the event, except [[Fiji]], which is [[Suspension from the Commonwealth of Nations|suspended from the Commonwealth]], and [[Tokelau]], which didn't send a team, in spite of threats of boycotts and athlete withdrawals.

The internationally acclaimed [[2010 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] improved the image of the Games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/oct/03/commonwealth-games-opening-ceremony-delhi-india |title='India has arrived': spectacular ceremony opens Commonwealth Games |publisher=The Guardian, UK |date= 3 October 2010|accessdate=5 October 2010 | location=London | first=Jason | last=Burke| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006004503/http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/oct/03/commonwealth-games-opening-ceremony-delhi-india| archivedate= 6 October 2010 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/commonwealthgames/8039988/Commonwealth-Games-2010-India-opens-doors-to-the-world-at-opening-ceremony.html |title=Commonwealth Games 2010: India opens doors to the world at opening ceremony |work=The Telegraph |date=3 October 2010|accessdate=5 October 2010 | location=London | first=Simon | last=Hart| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006045221/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/commonwealthgames/8039988/Commonwealth-Games-2010-India-opens-doors-to-the-world-at-opening-ceremony.html| archivedate= 6 October 2010 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dispelled negative notions surrounding them, with many observers remarking that they began on an apprehensive note, but were an exceptional experience with a largely positive ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/afp/101015/sports/cgames2010_aus|title=Australia praises India's 'exceptional' Games|date=15 October 2010|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]| accessdate=14 February 2011 }}{{dead link|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President of the [[International Olympic Committee]], [[Jacques Rogge]], said that India had made a good foundation for a future [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] bid, which was reiterated by the Australian Minister of Sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/commonwealth%20games/india-should-aim-for-olympics-australian-sports-minister-57139|title=India should aim for Olympics: Australian Sports Minister|publisher=[[NDTV]]|date=5 October 2010|accessdate=16 October 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008222034/http://www.ndtv.com/article/commonwealth%20games/india-should-aim-for-olympics-australian-sports-minister-57139| archivedate= 8 October 2010 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/commonwealth-games-2010/news/Games-good-foundation-for-Olympic-bid-by-India-Rogge/articleshow/6680736.cms|title=Games good foundation for Olympic bid by India: Rogge|work=The Times of India | date=4 October 2010|accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonwealth games Federation chief Mike Fennell stated that "Delhi delivered a fantastic Games".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/specials/sports/cwg-2010/Delhi-delivered-a-fantastic-Games/newdelhi/SP-Article10-613055.aspx |title=‘Delhi delivered a fantastic Games’ |work=Hindustan Times |date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513170054/http://www.hindustantimes.com/specials/sports/cwg-2010/Delhi-delivered-a-fantastic-Games/newdelhi/SP-Article10-613055.aspx |archivedate=13 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some observers accused sections of the media of bias, unfair expectations, and negative reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/commonwealth-games-2010/comm-games-news/its-time-to-reflect-on-how-delhi-got-it-right-20101014-16ltt.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=15 October 2010|accessdate=16 October 2010|first=Peter|last=Hanlon|title=It's time to reflect on how Delhi got it right| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017152227/http://www.smh.com.au/commonwealth-games-2010/comm-games-news/its-time-to-reflect-on-how-delhi-got-it-right-20101014-16ltt.html| archivedate= 17 October 2010 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development and preparation ==

===Organising committee===
[[File:Delhi 2010 commonwealth games organizing committee head office.jpg|thumb|left|OC main building]]The organisation of 2010 Commonwealth Games was beset by delays: in January 2010, the Indian Olympic Association vice-chairman [[Randhir Singh (sport shooter)|Raja Randhir Singh]] expressed concern that Delhi was not up to speed in forming and organising its games committee and, following a 2009 [[Indian Government]] report showing two-thirds of venues were behind schedule, [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] president Mike Fennell stated that the slow progress of preparations represented a serious risk to the event.&lt;ref name="bbc_cg"&gt;{{cite news|title=India admits 2010 Games problems|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8256127.stm|publisher=BBC  | date=15 September 2009 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singh also called for a revamp of the games' organising committees:&lt;ref name="reuters_cg"&gt;{{cite news|title=Olympic official calls for revamp of Delhi Games committee|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-42471320090915|agency=Reuters   | date=15 September 2009| accessdate=14 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jarnail Singh, a former Secretary of the Government of India, was appointed as the chief executive officer and [[Indian Olympic Association]] president [[Suresh Kalmadi]] was appointed as head of the committee. In spite of delays and the corruption cases levied on the organisors, commentators stated that they were confident that India will successfully host the games and do so on time.&lt;ref name="telegraph_cg"&gt;{{cite news|title=Delhi Commonwealth Games 'at grave risk of collapse'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/6190118/Delhi-Commonwealth-Games-at-grave-risk-of-collapse.html|author=Dean Nelson|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK  | date=15 September 2009 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian_cg"&gt;{{cite news|title=Only a year to run–and Delhi is losing race to host Commonwealth Games|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6834446.ece|author=Jeremy Page|work=The Times |location=UK  | date=15 September 2009 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the launch of the Queen's Baton Relay in October 2009, the Business Club of India (BCI) was formed through the partnership of the organising committee, the [[Confederation of Indian Industry]] (CII) and the [[Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry]] (FICCI). The BCI was formed to both market the Games and promote Indian business interests internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgdelhi2010.org/dcwg/index.php?q=node/685 Business at the Games]. 2010 Commonwealth Games.

[[File:Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium CWG opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|alt=Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, New Delhi|The main venue of the Games, the [[Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium]]]]
Events took place at 12 competition venues. A total of 20 training venues were used in the Games. Of these 20, one was used for archery; three for aquatics; two for lawn bowls; two for netball; eight for rugby sevens, including seven venues within [[Delhi University]]; two for shooting; one for squash; two for table tennis; one for weightlifting, three for wrestling and two for tennis.&lt;ref name="Non-Competition Venues"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgdelhi2010.org/non_competition_venues|title=Non-Competition Venues|publisher=Commonwealth Games Organising Committee|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927033237/http://www.cwgdelhi2010.org/non_competition_venues|archivedate=27 September 2010|deadurl=no|accessdate=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commonwealth Games Village provided accommodation and training for athletes of the Games, and was opened from 23 September to 18 October 2010. It is located along the east bank of the River Yamuna, in proximity to competition and training venues as well as city landmarks, and is spread over an area of {{convert|63.5|ha|acre}}. Comprising five main zones—the Residential Zone, the International Zone, the Training Area, the Main Dining and the Operational Zone—the Games Village, which is a non-smoking zone,&lt;ref name="Other Features"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgdelhi2010.org/other_features|title=Other Features|publisher=Commonwealth Games Organising Committee|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927051008/http://www.cwgdelhi2010.org/other_features|archivedate=27 September 2010|deadurl=no|accessdate=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is universally accessible particularly to accommodate [[disabled sports|para-sport]] athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgdelhi2010.org/games_village|title=Games Village|publisher=Commonwealth Games Organising Committee|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927033142/http://www.cwgdelhi2010.org/games_village|archivedate=27 September 2010|deadurl=no|accessdate=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were three main non-competition venues in the Games, besides the Commonwealth Games Village (see [[Venues of the 2010 Commonwealth Games#Commonwealth Games Village|above]]); namely the Delhi 2010 Commonwealth Games Organising Committee Headquarters, the Main Media Centre, and the Games Family Hotel, Hotel Ashok.

===Costs===
The initial total budget estimated by the [[Indian Olympic Association]] in 2003 for hosting the Games was {{INRConvert|16.2|b}}. In 2010, however, the official total budget soon escalated to an estimated {{INRConvert|115|b}}, a figure which excluded non-sports-related infrastructure development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Ravi Shankar |author2=Mihir Srivastava |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/108072/Sport/payoffs-&amp;-bribes-cast-a-shadow-on-cwg |title=Payoffs &amp; bribes cast a shadow on CWG: Sport : India Today |work=India Today |date=7 August 2010 |accessdate=3 October 2010 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710055421/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/108072/Sport/payoffs-&amp;-bribes-cast-a-shadow-on-cwg |archive-date=10 July 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Business Today (business magazine)|Business Today]] magazine estimated that the Games cost {{INRConvert|700|b}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/25/delhi-commonwealth-games-organiser-arrested|title=Delhi Commonwealth Games organiser arrested in corruption investigation|last=Press|first=Associated|date=2011-04-25|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 Commonwealth Games were reportedly the most expensive Commonwealth Games ever.&lt;ref&gt;[[2006 Commonwealth Games|Melbourne 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the second most expensive international [[multi-sport event]] ever held in [[Asia]], after the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], China.

A four-lane flyway, {{convert|2.2|km|abbr=on}} stretch from [[Lodhi Road]] to trans-Yamuna, linking the [[Commonwealth Games Village 2010|Games Village]] to the [[Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium]] was constructed which reduced the travelling time between the [[Commonwealth Games Village 2010|village]] and the Stadium to six minutes.

In response to concerns over the large number of trains that pass by the Delhi metropolitan region daily, construction of road under-bridges and over-bridges along railway lines have been completed. To expand road infrastructure, flyovers, cloverleaf flyovers, and bridges were built to improve links for the Games and city in general. Road-widening projects were finished with an emphasis being placed on expanding national highways. To improve traffic flow on existing roads, plans were made to make both the inner and outer Ring roads signal free.

To support its commitment to mass transport, nine corridors have been identified and were constructed as High Capacity Bus Systems (for example, one from Ambedkar Nagar to [[Red Fort]]). Six of these corridors were expected to be operational in 2010. Additionally, The [[Delhi Metro]] was expanded to accommodate more people and boost the use of public transport during the 2010 games. The metro has extended to [[Gurgaon]] and the [[Noida]] area. For this large increase in the size of the network, Delhi Metro had deployed 14 [[tunnel boring machine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indiaenews.com/business/20080318/105062.htm|title=Delhi Metro deploys 'record' 14 tunnel boring machines|accessdate=14 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radio Frequency Identification]] (RFID) was used to tag vehicles in venue parking lots to help organise mass parking and increase security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rfidworld.ca/delhi-commonwealth-games-2010-using-rfid-tags/189|title=Delhi Commonwealth Games 2010 using RFID tags

[[Indira Gandhi International Airport]] was modernised, expanded, and upgraded. Costing nearly $1.95&amp;nbsp;billion, [[Indira Gandhi International Airport#Terminal 3|Terminal 3]] has increased airport passenger capacity to more than 37 million passengers a year by 2010. A new runway has been constructed, allowing for more than 75 flights an hour. At more than 4400 metres long, it is one of Asia's longest. The airport has been connected to the city via a six-lane expressway ([[Delhi–Gurgaon Expressway]]) and the $580&amp;nbsp;million [[Delhi Airport Metro Express]] line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newdelhiairport.in/ |title=Indira Gandhi International Airport |publisher=Newdelhiairport.in |accessdate=14 October 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314015118/http://www.newdelhiairport.in/ | archivedate=14 March 2009| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green Games===
The organisers signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the United Nations Environment Programme to show the intention to host a "sustainable games" and to take the environment into consideration when constructing and renovating venues. [[Thyagaraj Sports Complex|Thyagaraj Stadium]] is intended to be a key example of environmentally considered construction.

In opposition to this intention, a number of environmental controversies arose and the adverse ecological impact of various aspects of the games have been protested by city residents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://delhigreens.com/tag/trees/ Trees].

The court appointed architect [[Charles Correa]] to assess the impact and he severely criticised the designs on ecological grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/correa-slams-dda-for-siri-fort-mess/431931/ Correa slams DDA for Siri Fort mess].

The Commonwealth Games village, located on the flood plains of the [[Yamuna]], has also been the subject of controversies about the flouting of ecological norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/games-village-flouting-ecological-norms/52071-3.html|title=News18.com: CNN-News18 Breaking News India, Latest News Headlines, Live News Updates|author=|date=|website=News18}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a prolonged legal battle between city residents and the state, construction was permitted to continue on the basis of an order of the Supreme Court of India in July 2009, which held that the government had satisfied the requirements of "due process of the law" by issuing public notice of its intention to begin construction work in September 1999 (a date four years prior to the acceptance of Delhi's bid for the games).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolpda/ifs_news/hi/newsid_8175000/8175954.stm |publisher=BBC News  | title=Court allows Indian Games village | date=30 July 2009 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other preparation===
In preparation for an influx of English-speaking tourists for the Games, the Delhi government implemented a program to teach English, and the necessary skills for serving tourists, to key workers—such as cab drivers, [[security guard|security workers]], waiters, porters, and service staff. In the two years prior to the Games 2000 drivers were taught English. In addition to Delhi, the Indian Government plans to expand the program to teach people in local tourist destinations in other parts of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaenews.com/travel/20080330/107541.htm|title=Lessons in English and etiquette ahead of Commonwealth Games|last=Roy|first=Rajeev Ranjan|date=30 March 2008|accessdate=13 May 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411211929/http://www.indiaenews.com/travel/20080330/107541.htm| archivedate= 11 April 2008 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HOHO DELHI.jpg|thumb|left|HOHO Delhi Bus Inauguration in Delhi]]
To facilitate hassle-free sightseeing in Delhi, [[Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation|Delhi Tourism]] undertook the launch of India's very first Hop on Hop Off bus known as [http://delhitourism.nic.in/delhitourism/transport/hoho.jsp HOHO DELHI], modelled on popular concept of transport facilities in Western countries. The bus, which is equipped with state-of-the-art technologies like digital video screens and GPS systems, also had trained guides who were responsible for giving information about the sites.

To prepare for the energy-usage spike during the Games and to end chronic [[power cuts]] in [[Delhi]], the government undertook a large power-production initiative to increase power production to 7000 MW (from the current 4500 MW). To achieve this goal, the government streamlined the power distribution process, direct additional energy to Delhi, and constructed new power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indiaenews.com/india/20080321/105643.htm|title=Delhi will have surplus power...|date=21 March 2008|accessdate=13 May 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504194524/http://www.indiaenews.com/india/20080321/105643.htm| archivedate= 4 May 2008 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to physical preparation, free accommodation for all athletes at the [[Commonwealth Games Village 2010|Games Village]], as well as free transport and other benefits, such as a free trip to the famed [[Taj Mahal]] and a reserved lane for participants on selected highways was provided&lt;ref name="Commonwealth Games, India"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cwgvisit.com/ |title=Commonwealth Games, India |publisher=Cwgvisit.com |date=4 October 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011122451/http://www.cwgvisit.com/ |archivedate=11 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Commonwealth Games Village 2010|Games Village]] will house over 8,000 athletes and officials for the Games. Indian states will train state police forces to handle tourist-related issues and deploy them prior to the Games. A large-scale
construction and "beautification" project has resulted in the demolition of hundreds of homes and the displacement of city dwellers—at least 100,000 of New Delhi's 160,000 homeless people have removed from shelters, some of which have been demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/01/14/india.slums/index.html|title= India razes slums, leaves poor homeless|accessdate=4 March 2010 |publisher=CNN | date=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100116/BUSINESS/701169964/1005 |title=Poor lose before Games begin |accessdate=14 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105034650/http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20100116%2FBUSINESS%2F701169964%2F1005 |archivedate=5 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bamboo screens have been erected around city slums to separate visitors from the sights of the slums,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/commonwealthgames/6043719/New-Delhi-to-hide-slums-with-bamboo-curtains-during-2010-Commonwealth-Games.html |accessdate=4 March 2010 | work=The Daily Telegraph |title=New Delhi to hide slums with bamboo 'curtains' during 2010 Commonwealth Games | location=London | first=Dean | last=Nelson | date=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a practice which human rights campaigners have deemed dishonest and immoral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/all-aboard-delhis-beggar-express-1914922.html|title=Aboard Delhi's beggar express|accessdate=5 March 2010 | work=The Independent | location=London | first=Andrew | last=Buncombe | date=3 March 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304140523/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/all-aboard-delhis-beggar-express-1914922.html| archivedate= 4 March 2010 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Delhi High Court]] implemented a series of "mobile courts" to be dispatched throughout Delhi to relocate migrant beggars from Delhi streets. The mobile courts would consider each beggar on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the beggar should be sent back to his/her state of residence, or be permitted to remain in government-shelters.&lt;ref name="indiaenews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaenews.com/india/20080507/116544.htm|title=Mobile courts suggested to make Delhi beggar-free|date=4 May 2008|accessdate=13 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Queen's Baton relay==

The [[Queen's Baton Relay]] began when the baton, which contains [[Elizabeth II]]'s message to the athletes, left [[Buckingham Palace]] on 29 October 2009. The baton arrived at the 2010 Games opening ceremony on 3 October 2010, after visiting the other 54 nations of the Commonwealth and travelling throughout India, reaching millions of people to join in the celebrations for the Games. The baton arrived in India on 25 June 2010 through the Wagah Border crossing from Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.samaylive.com/nation/676466754.html CWG 2010 Queen's baton arrives in India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111142051/http://english.samaylive.com/nation/676466754.html |date=11 January 2012 }} CWG 2010 Queen's baton arrives in India&lt;/ref&gt;

The baton was designed by Michael Foley, a graduate of the [[National Institute of Design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/events-tournaments/commonwealth-games-2010/top-stories/Relay-baton-depicts-Indias-diverse-culture-tradition/articleshow/5178236.cms |title=Relay baton depicts India's diverse culture &amp; tradition |work=The Times of India |date=30 October 2009 |accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a triangular section of aluminium twisted into a [[helix]] shape and then coated with coloured soils collected from all the regions of India. The coloured soils are a first for the styling of a Queen's Baton. A jewel-encrusted box was used to house the Queen's message, which was laser-engraved onto a miniature 18 carat gold leaf—representative of the ancient Indian 'patras. The Queen's baton is ergonomically contoured for ease of use. It is {{convert|664|mm}} high, {{convert|34|mm}} wide at the base, and {{convert|86|mm}} wide at the top and weighs {{convert|1900|g}}.

The Queen's baton has a number of technological features including:
* The ability to capture images and sound
* [[Global positioning system]] (GPS) technology so the baton's location can be tracked
* Embedded [[light emitting diodes]] (LEDs) which will change into the colours of a country's flag whilst in that country
* A text messaging capability so that people can send messages of congratulations and encouragement to the baton bearers throughout the relay

==Legacy==
One of the aims of hosting the Commonwealth Games was to build world-class athletics infrastructure within the country, expose audiences to top-level non-cricket competition and encourage the youth to "Come out and play" (the official theme of the games).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgdelhi2010.org/come_out_and_play |title=Come Out and Play &amp;#124; XIX Commonwealth Games 2010 Delhi |publisher=Cwgdelhi2010.org |accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building a sporting culture that looks beyond cricket is seen as an important task for a country which won its first ever [[India at the 2008 Summer Olympics|individual Olympic gold medal]] in [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing 2008]], despite having the world's second-largest population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/gordonfarquhar/2010/10/sporting_legacy_for_india.html|date=14 October 2010|publisher=BBC |title=Will India take next steps to secure sporting legacy?| accessdate=14 January 2011 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125061611/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/gordonfarquhar/2010/10/sporting_legacy_for_india.html| archivedate= 25 January 2011| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sebastian Coe]], former Olympic gold medalist and chairman of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] [[London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games|Organising Committee]], was at the stadium during the 4 × 400 m women's relay and described the audience's cheers for the racers as "potentially the moment that could change the course of athletics in Asia, the moment that could inspire thousands of people who'd never even seen an athletics track before to get involved... To build a truly global capacity in sport, you have to take it round the world – out of your own backyard. That means taking risks and facing challenges, but it has to be done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/jamespearce/2010/10/did_delhi_live_up_to_expectati.html |title=Did Delhi live up to expectations? |last=Pearce |first=James|date=14 October 2010|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films on Delhi 2010 - Dangal (2016)===
[[File:Film set Dangal (1).jpg|thumb|The Games as in the film [[Dangal (film)|Dangal]]]]
[[Geeta Phogat]] became India's first female wrestler ever to win Gold at a Commonwealth Games in Delhi 2010, where she won the Gold medal ([[Wrestling at the 2010 Commonwealth Games – Women's freestyle 55 kg|55&amp;nbsp;kg]]) while her sister [[Babita Kumari]] won a Silver medal ([[Wrestling at the 2010 Commonwealth Games – Women's freestyle 51 kg|51&amp;nbsp;kg]]). Their story was featured in the 2016 Indian film ''[[Dangal (film)|Dangal]]'' released on December 23, 2016. Parts of the 2010 Commonwealth Games setting were rebuilt for the film. [[Pehlwani|Dangal]] is the [[Hindi]] term for a wrestling competition. Dangal became the highest-grossing film ever at the Indian (domestic) box office on January 7, 2017 and went on to collect over ₹2000 crores (US$286 million) in box office revenues worldwide.

==Concerns and controversies==
{{Main|Concerns and controversies over the 2010 Commonwealth Games}}

Several concerns were raised over the preparations of the Games and these included excessive [[cost overrun|budget overruns]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/news/sports/commonwealth-games-2010-the-ballooning-budget-19366.php|title=Commonwealth Games 2010: The ballooning budget|date=7 April 2010|accessdate=24 September 2010|publisher=NDTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; likelihood of floods in Delhi due to heavy [[monsoon]] rains, infrastructural compromise, poor living conditions at the [[Commonwealth Games Village 2010|Commonwealth Games Village]], delays in construction of the [[Venues of the 2010 Commonwealth Games|main Games' venues]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/commonwealth_games/delhi_2010/9028263.stm|title=Commonwealth Games 2010: England urge more Delhi work|date=24 September 2010|accessdate=24 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924044207/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/commonwealth_games/delhi_2010/9028263.stm|archivedate=24 September 2010|deadurl=no|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/commonwealth_games/delhi_2010/9029049.stm|title=Australia say India should not host Commonwealth Games|date=24 September 2010|accessdate=24 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926213230/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/commonwealth_games/delhi_2010/9029049.stm|archivedate=26 September 2010|deadurl=no|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; the withdrawal of prominent athletes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/commonwealth_games/delhi_2010/8825573.stm|title=Geraint Thomas pulls out of Commonwealth Games in Delhi|date=24 September 2010|accessdate=24 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924044456/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/commonwealth_games/delhi_2010/8825573.stm|archivedate=24 September 2010|deadurl=no|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; widespread corruption by officials of the Games' Organising Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-22/delhi-faces-filth-security-fears-bridge-collapse-at-commonwealth-games.html|title=Bridge Collapse Adds Safety to Terror Fears Before Delhi Games|last=Rossingh|first=Danielle|date=22 September 2010|accessdate=24 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925214120/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-22/delhi-faces-filth-security-fears-bridge-collapse-at-commonwealth-games.html|archivedate=25 September 2010|deadurl=no|publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and possibility of a terrorist attack by militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/delhi-on-terror-alert-for-commonwealth-games-closing-ceremony/story-e6frfkyi-1225938435194#ixzz2AtFO051J|title=Delhi on terror alert for Commonwealth Games closing ceremony|date=14 October 2010|accessdate=24 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014135333/http://www.news.com.au/world/delhi-on-terror-alert-for-commonwealth-games-closing-ceremony/story-e6frfkyi-1225938435194|archivedate=14 October 2010|deadurl=no|publisher=news.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative pre-event publicity and heavy security presence played in part in low spectator attendance during the initial events. However the numbers picked up as the Games progressed.

===Formation of investigation committee===
The day after the conclusion of the Games, the Indian Government announced the formation of a special committee to probe the allegations of corruption and mismanagement against the Organising Committee. The probe committee will be led by former [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India]] VK Shunglu. This probe will be in addition to the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]], [[Enforcement Directorate]], and [[Central Vigilance Commission]] investigations already underway. The [[Prime Minister of India]], [[Manmohan Singh|Dr Manmohan Singh]] had promised in mid-August, when reports of the bungling first surfaced, that corrupt officials will be given "severe and exemplary" punishment after the Games. The probe committee is tasked with looking into "all aspects of organising and conducting" the Games, and "to draw lessons from it." It was given three months to submit its report, but the report was never publicly released.&lt;ref name="Times of India"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-16/india/28259235_1_probe-panel-oc-bosses-alleged-misappropriation|title=CWG: Probe panel to report in 3 months|date=16 October 2010|work=The Times of India|accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Hindu"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article832511.ece|title=Centre orders probe into CWG issues|last=Balaji|first=J.|date=16 October 2010|work=The Hindu|accessdate=16 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017141103/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article832511.ece|archivedate=17 October 2010|deadurl=no|location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports|Indian Sports Ministry]] has directed the Organising Committee of the 2010 Commonwealth Games (led by Suresh Kalmadi), to not release any staffer from their positions till the probe committee's work is finished.

'''Al-Naqil Football Club''' ({{lang-ar|'''نادي النقل'''}}, meaning ''Transport Football Club''), was an [[Iraq]]i football club based in [[Baghdad]] that was founded in 1937 under the name '''Al-Sikak Al-Hadeed''' (meaning ''Iron Railways''). They were renamed Al-Naqil in 1974, competing in the first season of the [[Iraqi Premier League]] and finishing as runners-up. The club was dissolved in 1975 as they had no administration or financial backing. Their players left to join newly-promoted club [[Al-Zawra'a SC|Al-Zawraa]], who went on to become giants of Iraqi football.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/iraq75.html Iraq 1974/75]&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Naqil won one trophy in their existence, which was the 1973 Baghdad League, a tournament held to allow teams to continue playing matches after the premature end to the [[1972–73 Iraqi Central First Division]]. They won the tournament by defeating [[Al-Shorta SC|Aliyat Al-Shorta]] 3–1 in the final match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alshorta.webs.com/overview Al-Shorta SC History]&lt;/ref&gt; They also reached the final of the [[1973–74 Iraqi Central FA Cup]], but they lost 2–1 against [[Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niiiis.com/c74-75.html 1973/74 Iraqi Central FA Cup]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Auburn Sports Arena''' was a 2,500 seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Auburn, Alabama]].  Nicknamed "The Barn," it opened in 1946.  It was home to the [[Auburn University]] Tigers [[basketball]] team.  It was replaced when the [[Beard–Eaves–Memorial Coliseum]] opened in 1968.

After it closed, it continued to host Auburn's women's gymnastics team.

In 1996, the Auburn Sports Arena was destroyed by a fire that occurred during the Auburn-LSU football game.  The fire was likely started by the embers of a tailgater's grill.

The site has since been replaced with a parking deck.

'''''BASEketball''''' is a 1998 American [[Sports film|sports]] [[comedy film]] co-written and directed by [[David Zucker (filmmaker)|David Zucker]] and starring ''[[South Park]]'' creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], along with [[Yasmine Bleeth]], [[Jenny McCarthy]], [[Robert Vaughn]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], and [[Dian Bachar]]. 

The film follows the history of the sport (created by Zucker years earlier) of the same name,{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} from its invention by the lead characters as a game they could win against more [[Sportsperson|athletic]] types, to its development as a nationwide [[Sports league|league]] sport and a target of corporate sponsorship.

This is the only work involving Parker and Stone that was neither written, directed, nor produced by them, although Zucker himself has stated that Parker and Stone contributed innumerable suggestions for the film, most of which were used.

==Plot==
Unlikable [[slacker]]s and close friends Joe "Coop" Cooper and Doug Remer [[gate crashing|gate crash]] a high-school reunion and are shunned by their more mature (and successful) classmates. They find themselves outside drinking beer and shooting a basketball when two classmates challenge them to a game. After seeing that their opponents are very good at basketball, they say they will only play a game they picked up in the streets (while secretly inventing the rules as they play, based on both basketball and baseball). After winning, they decide to refine the rules to the game and Coop makes the first BASEketball out of a [[La-Z-Boy]] chair. Their friend, Kenny "Squeak" Scolari, tags along and the sport becomes very popular in the neighborhood over the next six months.

Businessman Ted Denslow meets Coop and Remer and proposes the creation of the National BASEketball League (NBL) along with numerous rules in place to prevent its decline: teams cannot switch cities, players cannot be traded, individuals cannot make money via corporate sponsorship deals, and it is completely open to anyone who wants to play, with Denslow stating that "anyone can be a sports' hero". Coop initially hesitates, but quickly accepts the opportunity at hand.

Five years later, the NBL is in full swing with teams, fans, stadiums, and a major championship, the Denslow Cup. Denslow is owner of the Milwaukee Beers, Coop and Remer's team. During the championship game, Denslow dies from choking on a hot dog, causing Coop to miss his shot and costing the Beers the game. Denslow's [[Will and testament|will]] names Coop as owner of the Beers for one year on the condition that they win the next Denslow Cup; otherwise, ownership reverts to Denslow's widow Yvette. Coop declares Remer part owner of the team, and they come to meet Jenna Reed, head of the Dream Come True Foundation, and Joey, one of the children in her care and an avid fan of BASEketball.

Baxter Cain, owner of the Dallas Felons, wants to remove Denslow's rules preventing [[monetization]] of the sport, but could not while Denslow was alive. However, Coop refuses to accept any changes; Cain partners with Yvette as he tries to make the Beers lose the next Denslow Cup so she will own the team.

Cain cuts the funding to Jenna's foundation to get Coop and Remer to adopt a clothing line; Coop is against it, but Remer agrees and becomes obsessed with his newfound status. After the semifinals, Cain informs Coop and Remer that the clothing line has been produced through [[child labor]] in [[Calcutta]]; if the public finds out, the team and Jenna's foundation will be ruined. Cain blackmails Coop and Remer into losing or forfeiting the Denslow Cup game or he will inform the public. Jenna learns about the scandal and breaks up with Coop as Coop and Remer blame each other for the predicament.

With their friendship in shambles, Coop goes to Calcutta, aiming to resolve the situation by replacing the child workers with adults. Making it back to the championship game just as it begins, Coop still blames Remer and the Beers perform abysmally; by the seventh-inning stretch, the Beers are down 16–0. Having had enough of Coop and Remer's fighting, Squeak gives the stadium a passionate speech, reminding Coop and Remer where they came from, how much they changed everyone else's lives, and what they risk losing. Moved, Coop and Remer reconcile their differences as Yvette breaks off her alliance with Cain. After shifting their focus back in the game, they are poised to win when Coop's La-Z-Boy pops. Coop is distraught until Joey brings him a new BASEketball made from a [[Barcalounger]]. After a harrowing last throw, they win the Denslow Cup. Jenna forgives Coop as Yvette makes out with Remer.

==Soundtrack==

The band also appears as the live entertainment at the home stadium of the Milwaukee Beers, playing "Take on Me" and several of their other songs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://80smusicchannel.blogspot.com/2008/10/ha-take-on-me-1985.html 80s Music Channel: Take on Me]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives ''BASEketball'' a 42% approval rating based on 50 critics (an [[average rating]] of 5 out of 10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = BASEketball (1998) |url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/baseketball/ |website = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |accessdate =May 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also garnered a score of 38 out of 100 from 18 critics on [[Metacritic]], which indicates "generally unfavorable reviews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = BASEketball Reviews - Metacritic |url = http://www.metacritic.com/movie/baseketball|publisher = [[Metacritic]] |accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yasmine Bleeth and Jenny McCarthy were nominated at the [[1998 Golden Raspberry Awards]] for Worst Actress and Worst Supporting Actress respectively for the movie. Bleeth lost to the [[Spice Girls]] for ''[[Spice World (film)|Spice World]]'' while McCarthy lost to [[Maria Pitillo]] for ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]''.

Lead actors Trey Parker and Matt Stone later went on to reference the movie's mostly negative reception in the third episode of season eight of their co-created TV show ''[[South Park]]'', "[[The Passion of the Jew]]", in which two of the show's main characters, [[Kenny McCormick]] and [[Stan Marsh]] (voiced by Stone and Parker, respectively), attempt to get a refund for the tickets they bought to see the [[Mel Gibson]] movie ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', the latter at one point telling the former "This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible! This is just like when we got our money back for ''BASEketball''!"

==In popular culture==
The film is credited with coining the Internet slang term "[[wikt:derp|derp]]".&lt;ref name="nymag"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Becket|first1=Stefan|title=The Origins of ''Derp''|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/06/derp-meaning-origin.html|accessdate=May 3, 2018|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siese|first1=April|title=These ‘BASEketball’ Quotes Are Psych-Out Gold|url=https://uproxx.com/movies/baseketball-best-quotes/2/|website=[[Uproxx]]|accessdate=May 3, 2018|date=October 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trey Parker and Matt Stone later referenced the term on the [[South Park (season 3)|third season]] of ''South Park'' in the episode "[[The Succubus (South Park)|The Succubus]]", where [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] is replaced by [[Mr. Derp]].&lt;ref name="nymag"/&gt;

'''East End Park''' is a former [[major league baseball]] [[baseball park|park]] located in the [[East End, Cincinnati|East End]] neighborhood of [[Cincinnati]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/P/PK_PEN01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scsr.org/19CCBB/Ballparks/EEP.htm&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:East End Park (High Shot).jpg|thumb|left|250px|The spot where East End Park once stood.]] --&gt; The ballpark, which is also known to baseball historians as '''Pendleton Park''', was home to the Cincinnati Reds of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] (now more commonly known as the [[Cincinnati Kelly's Killers]]) during the 1891 baseball season. The club was led by the flamboyant star, [[King Kelly|Mike "King" Kelly]].

==The Reds' of 1891==

The east side Reds had no relationship to the current [[Cincinnati Reds]] team. Those Reds had transferred from the Association to the [[National League]] in 1890. With the League and the Association on bad terms following several years of peace and [[Players' League]] stress of 1890, the Association decided to field a team of its own in Cincinnati for 1891.

This peculiar situation gave the city of Cincinnati two major league baseball teams in the same year with the same nickname. The National League Reds, who played on the west side of Cincinnati; and the Association Reds who played on the east side. Adding to the confusion was the presence of another Reds team in the Association, the [[Boston Reds (1890–1891)|Boston Reds]]. All of these Reds teams derived their nicknames, indirectly, from the original [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]] of 1869–1870.

The east side Reds team has also been referred to as '''Kelly's Killers''' and the Cincinnati '''Porkers''', as well as Kelly's Wonders, Kelly's Braves and Kelly's Hustlers. Some historians have extended the best known of these informal names by calling them the "Cincinnati Kelly's Killers". However, the Cincinnati papers who covered the team in 1891 only occasionally referred to the club by any of these nicknames.

==Pendleton Park / East End Park==
Kelly's search for a suitable playing field led him to what was then the far east end of the city, in a picturesque location along the [[Ohio River]] that was known as '''Pendleton Park''' or '''Pendleton Grounds'''. The club secured a lease and built a small ballpark within Pendleton Park, which was dubbed '''East End Park''' by the media.

The location of the park was just off Eastern Avenue (now called Riverside Drive), where the '''Schmidt Recreation Complex''' is currently located. The ballpark was located between modern day Humbert Street (southwest, right field); Babb (or Babby) Alley (northeast, some distance beyond third base); Watson Street (southeast, left field); and Ridgeley Street (northwest, first base). Ridgeley street now dead ends at Babby Alley but it once extended the distance of the third base bleachers. The diamond was situated toward the northwest (or actually north-northwest) corner of the block.

Just south of Humbert is the Ohio River. Many patrons attending east end Reds games were dropped off by steamboat, coming either from the city or from [[Coney Island, Cincinnati, Ohio|Coney Island]]. East End Park was one of only a handful of major league parks to have access by way of a river.

==The Reds Were Blue on Sundays==

At the time, the National League did not allow Sunday baseball games to be played. As a result, the rival American Association capitalized on this by having their teams play Sunday games. However, the Cincinnati Association club had difficulty with this because the city had the [[blue law]] in place which also disallowed Sunday games. Owners of the Cincinnati Reds made repeated attempts at playing games on Sundays. Sometimes the Mayor of Cincinnati, Mayor [[John B. Mosby]], would enforce the law and other times he would not. When the Mayor did enforce the law, the Reds and their opponents found themselves in jail.

In one instance, before a game played on May 24 against the Philadelphia Athletics, the Chief of Police behaved like a Colonel in the US Army. Dressed in a full military uniform, Chief Dietsch had seventy-five of his police officers march back and forth on the baseball field prior to game time to try to intimidate the baseball club. He even went as far as to have seventy-five more police officers waiting at the station if the Reds attempted to play. The players went ahead and attempted to play anyway. When the game entered the second half of the first inning, Chief Deitsch had enough and had his officers arrest all of the players. The next day the Cincinnati Commercial Gazette reported that "It would be commendable in Chief Deitsch if he would display as much zeal in closing saloons and shutting off a few of the crap games that he has shown in stopping Sunday base ball." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.scsr.org/19CCBB/Teams/CR4/1891/BS/05/24.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Cincinnati Commercial Gazette'', May 25, 1891&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demise of Mike Kelly's "Killers"==

The east side Reds ballpark proved to be too remote for drawing fans consistently and as a result the club did not fare very well at the box office. During a day off on August 17, it was decided to suspend operations of the franchise until a new ballpark could be built on the west side of town. Ownership was planning to reactivate the club for the start of the 1892 baseball season. The final Reds game played at East End Park was on August 13 against the Boston Reds. The game resulted in a 1-7 Cincinnati loss. The club's final game was on the road with an 8-0 loss to the [[St. Louis Browns (NL)|St. Louis Browns]] on August 16, 1891, in St. Louis.

The Milwaukee Brewers of the Western League stepped in and finished out the Reds schedule.  Several of Mike Kelly's Reds joined the Milwaukee club including business manager [[Frank Bancroft]]. The Brewers played their first game on the 18th, again in St. Louis. Kelly was not among the new club's members, as he returned to his familiar home in Boston to resume his career, playing with the AA's Boston Reds club and then finishing the season with the Boston Beaneaters of the NL.

Kelly's Beaneaters won the League pennant while the Boston Reds would go on to win the Association pennant. This proved to be the last hurrah for the Association, which merged with the National League during the off-season. With a Cincinnati team already in the National League, the Cincinnati Association franchise was done.

==Aftermath and legacy==

[[File:East End Park (High Shot).jpg|thumb|left|250px|The site of East End Park as it looks today.]]

In 1896, a few years after the short-lived experiment with major league baseball on the east side of Cincinnati failed, the Pendleton grounds were acquired by the [[Cincinnati Gymnasium and Athletic Club]], and became known as the '''Cincinnati Gym Grounds'''. The Athletic Club retained the ballfield and grandstand, and built a swimming pool in the center field area near the clubhouse building.

The East End ballpark suffered severe damage following flooding in the spring of 1897, situated as it was in the floodplain of the Ohio River. The outfield wall and bleachers were swept out into the Ohio River, leaving just the grandstand, pavilion and club house. All were restored during late spring of 1897 and were ready for use again.&lt;ref&gt;Cincinnati Commercial Gazette | May 16, 1897&lt;/ref&gt;

The ballpark was considered for use as a temporary home for the National League Reds in 1900, after [[Crosley Field|League Park]] was severely damaged by fire the night of May 27–28. The Reds instead chose to play their games on the road for the next month until their own park could be sufficiently restored.&lt;ref name="rhodes133"&gt;Rhodes, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Cincinnati's Board of Park Commissioners and Park Department proposed a concrete sidewalk to be created and that it extend the length of the park bordering with Eastern Avenue to provide a place for people to walk to and from work; however a 10-foot artificial stone sidewalk was established.&lt;ref name="annual190137"&gt;Annual Report 1901, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="annual190739"&gt;Annual Report 1907, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Thoughts of improving the grounds were not welcomed as the annual flooding prevents permanent structures from being built. Benches that had been placed the year before were washed away by the recent floods.&lt;ref name=annual190739/&gt;

The larger park area once known as Pendleton Park (which historians often present as the name for the ballpark itself) still exists and is currently known as '''Schmidt Recreation Complex''' or Schmidt Recreation Center, which has four softball diamonds, two of them overlapping the East End Park site, and two of them further west within the park.

The current softball field known as C.L. Harrison Field approximates the original orientation of the diamond, only somewhat farther to the north. The photographic evidence indicates that the original 1891 diamond was located in what would be the right field area of the Harrison field. In the opposite corner of the property, another softball field, the current Paul Kramer Field, occupies what was once the outfield area of East End Park.

The surroundings of the park are not significantly different from the 1890s. A number of the nearby houses still stand. Aerial views from Google maps indicate that water from the Ohio still wreaks occasional havoc with the ballfields there.

Only a small number of major league baseball fields from the 1890s survive as athletic fields (Cleveland's [[League Park]], and St. Louis' [[Sportsman's Park]], for example.). The two softball diamonds occupying East End Park's footprint allow the visitor a rare opportunity to imagine major league baseball being played there, over a century earlier.

'''Firestone Stadium''' is a baseball and softball stadium located in [[Akron, Ohio]], United States. The stadium was dedicated on July 25, 1925 by [[Harvey Firestone]], the founder of the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company]].  It was owned and operated by the Firestone company until it was donated to the City of Akron in 1988. It has a seating capacity of 4,576.

From 1999 to 2017, it served as the home of the [[Akron Racers]] of the [[National Pro Fastpitch]] softball league. The stadium has been the site of the annual [[Mid-American Conference Softball Tournament]] since 2008, after previously hosting it from 2002 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://mac-sports.com/documents/2016/3/24/2016_SB_Record_Book.pdf |title= MAC Softball Record Book |publisher=[[Mid-American Conference]] |format= PDF|date=March 24, 2016 |accessdate=May 11, 2016 |pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Franklin Field''' is the home of the [[Penn Relays]], and is the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s stadium for [[American football|football]], [[track and field]], [[lacrosse]] and formerly for [[soccer]], [[field hockey]] and [[baseball]]. It is also used by Penn students for recreation, and for [[intramural]] and [[college athletics|club sports]], including [[touch football (American)|touch football]] and [[cricket]], and is the site of Penn's graduation exercises, weather permitting.

Franklin Field is located in [[Philadelphia]], at the eastern edge of Penn's campus, across the [[Schuylkill River]] from [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]].

Deemed by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] as the oldest stadium still operating for football, it was the site of the nation's first scoreboard in 1895, the nation's first stadium with an upper deck of seats in 1922, and was the site of the first radio broadcast of a football game in 1922 on [[WTEL (AM)|WIP]] and the first television broadcast of a football game by [[KYW-TV|Philco]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pennathletics.com/page/franklin-field&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1958 until 1970, the stadium was the home field of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] of the [[National Football League]].

==History==
[[File:FranklinField1922.PNG|thumb|left|200px| Workmen laying bricks on south wall of Franklin Field circa 1922.]] Franklin Field was built for {{USD|100000|1895}} and dedicated on April 20, 1895, for the first running of the [[Penn Relays]]. 
The Field supplemented and eventually replaced the venue called '''University Grounds''', which was located a few blocks west on a block bounded by Spruce Street (north), 38th Street (east), Pine Street (south), Woodland Avenue and 37th Street T-intersection (northwest). Its location was typically given as "37th and Spruce".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archives.upenn.edu/img/alum/blkly1894x600.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

Permanent Franklin Field construction did not begin until after the turn of the century. Weightman Hall gymnasium, the stadium, and permanent grandstands were designed by architect [[Frank Miles Day|Frank Miles Day &amp; Brother]] and were erected from 1903 to 1905 at a cost of {{USD|500000|1905}}. The field was 714 feet long and 443 feet wide. The site featured a ¼-mile track, a football field, and a baseball diamond. Beneath the stands were indoor tracks and indoor training facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nitzsche|first=George E.|title=University of Pennsylvania: Its History, Traditions, Buildings and Memorials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CWYgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=%22Weightman+Hall%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2ReAZ8GC-W&amp;sig=bDzE58YjLmlHn9vWBPIGS6nO7N4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=b-76SZvtJcOFtgeJn7naBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5#PPA186,M1|publisher=International Publishing Company|year=1918|location=Philadelphia|edition=Seventh |isbn=|pages=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, university officials, led by George Neitzche, planned with the city to build a new 100,000-seat half-sunken stadium for $750,000 at Woodland Ravine, a depression on the southeastern side of [[The Woodlands (Philadelphia)|Woodland Cemetery]]. Plans called for a new train station called Union Station which would feature a [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] stop and a stop on a proposed (and never built) elevated subway line connected to the [[Market–Frankford Line]]. Architecture firm Koronski &amp; Cameron created a rendering but plans quickly collapsed. Five years later, it was decided instead to expand Franklin Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last=|title=99 Years Ago in Philadelphia: Middle of February, 1916|date=2015-02-18|publisher=Philaphilia|url =http://philaphilia.blogspot.com/2015/02/99-years-ago-in-philadelphia-middle-of.html|accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current stadium structure was built in the 1920s, designed by Day &amp; Klauder, after the original wooden bleachers were torn down. The lower tier was erected in 1922. The old wood stands were razed immediately following the Penn Relays and the new concrete lower tier and seating for 50,000 were built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=PENN CANNOT BE HOST.; Changes at Franklin Field Bar Track for Intercollegiates.|date=1922-01-08|work=[[New York Times]]|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/01/08/107044252.pdf|pages=120|accessdate=2009-04-17 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second tier was added in 1925, again designed by [[Charles Klauder|Day &amp; Klauder]], when it became the second (and the largest) two-tiered stadium in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mary D. |last=McConaghy|author2=Michael T.

[[File:Penn - Franklin Field - 1922.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Franklin Field upon completion in 1922.]] The first football radio broadcast originated from Franklin Field in 1922. It was carried by Philadelphia station [[WTEL (AM)|WIP]]. This claim is pre-empted by an earlier live radio broadcast emanating from Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, on October 8, 1921, a full year before Franklin Field's claim to fame. Harold W. Arlin announced the live broadcast of the Pitt-West Virginia football game on October 8, 1921, on radio station KDKA. The first commercial football television broadcast in 1939 also came from Franklin Field.&lt;ref name=Eagles /&gt;

The [[1936 Democratic National Convention]] was concluded at Franklin Field, where President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] delivered his acceptance speech after being renominated for a second term.

In the university's football heyday—when Penn led the nation in attendance—the 65,000-seat stadium was expanded each fall with temporary stands to seat 78,000. Today, Franklin Field, named after Penn's founder, [[Benjamin Franklin]], seats 52,958.

Franklin Field switched from grass to AstroTurf in 1969. It was the first National Football League stadium to use artificial turf. The stadium's fifth AstroTurf surface was installed in 1993. The current Sprinturf field replaced the AstroTurf in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Gertner|title=Franklin Field features new turf, scoreboard|date=2004-09-02|work=[[Daily Pennsylvanian]]|url=http://media.www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2004/09/02/Sports/Franklin.Field.Features.New.Turf.Scoreboard-2151153.shtml|accessdate=2008-12-17|language=}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin Field was considered a candidate to host games for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]].

===Penn Relays===
{{details|Penn Relays}}
Franklin Field has hosted the annual [[Penn Relays|Penn Relays Carnival]], the largest track-and-field meet in the U.S., for over 100&amp;nbsp;years.

The first Penn Relays was held in 1895. Frank B. Ellis, chairman of Penn's track committee, was looking for an event to mark the dedication of the school's then new stadium, Franklin Field. Two years earlier, during his senior year at Penn, Penn and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] competed in a one-mile relay race in which four runners from each school each ran a quarter of a mile. That race had been an outgrowth of intramural relay races held at Penn. Ellis and others arranged a series of relay races to take place on Saturday afternoon, April 20, 1895. 64 competitors from eight colleges, six prep schools and two high schools took part. Eight two-team races were run with Harvard beating Penn in the mile-relay feature in 3:34.4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=| last=| title=The Relays!| date=1955-05-02| work=[[Sports Illustrated]]| url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1069475/1/index.htm| pages=| accessdate=2009-01-08| language=| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717170006/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1069475/1/index.htm| archivedate=2012-07-17| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Relays were featured in the April 29, 1961, premiere of [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]]'s ''[[Wide World of Sports (US TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]''.

Following the [[Montreal]] [[1976 Summer Olympics]] and in honor of the [[United States Bicentennial]], Franklin Field hosted The Bicentennial Meet of Champions track and field event on August 4, 1976. Montreal Olympians at the meet included [[Hasely Crawford]], [[Don Quarrie]], [[Michael Shine]] and [[Edwin Moses]].

The University of Pennsylvania hosted the two-day [[Liberty Bell Classic|1980 Liberty Bell Track and Field Classic]], an alternate to the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] for 26 countries participating in the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]] which were held in Moscow. The Liberty Bell Classic began on July 16, 1980. It was the largest international track meet held in the U.S. since the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] in terms of the number of foreign competitors. Franklin Field hosted the track and field events where 20,111 spectators saw the final evening of competitions. In several events, the times were better than those in Moscow, such as American [[Renaldo Nehemiah]]'s time of 13.31 in the 110m hurdles ahead of East German gold medal winner [[Thomas Munkelt]]'s time of 13.39.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Craig| last=Neff| title=...and Meanwhile In Philadelphia: Half a world from Lenin Stadium, boycotting athletes, some of whom gave Olympian performances, proved there's no alternative to the Games| date=1980-07-28| work=[[Sports Illustrated]]| url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1123636/index.htm| pages=| accessdate=2009-06-15| language=| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121202235510/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1123636/index.htm| archivedate=2012-12-02| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Track configuration===
The track in Franklin Field has a rarely used configuration where the 400 metre circumference is achieved in lane 5, rather than in lane one.  Thus there are two curbs on the track, inside of lane one and also inside of lane 5.  In order to accommodate the full fields of the Penn Relays and other meets, special adaptations are made with a movable curb on the backstretch to stagger the runners to arrive at a common break point in lane 5, rather than the conventional lane one.  Single lap races in the inner lanes, run portions of an extra straightaway.  Multiple lap races spend the majority of the race in lane 5 to run the proper distances.&lt;ref&gt;http://sites.google.com/site/collegeovalscom/ivy-league/franklin-field&lt;/ref&gt;

The current track was installed in 2015 by [http://www.attsports.com/ ATT Sports, Inc.], and uses a Rekortan track surface.

===Penn Quakers===
Penn football played on Franklin Field for the first time in 1895. The University of Pennsylvania was one of the top football schools in the first years of college football.

===Philadelphia Eagles===
The [[Philadelphia Eagles]] played at Franklin Field from [[1958 NFL season|1958]] through [[1970 NFL season|1970]]. They moved to the stadium for the 1958 season after leaving [[Connie Mack Stadium]]. Franklin Field would seat over 60,000 for the Eagles whereas Connie Mack had a capacity of 39,000. According to then-Eagles president Frank L. McNamee, the Eagles did not pay rent for use of Franklin Field because Penn was a not-for-profit organization. Instead, the Eagles donated between $75,000 and $100,000 per-year to pay for maintenance and other expenses. The university collected all concessions and parking revenue.&lt;ref name=Eagles /&gt;

On October 11, 1959, NFL Commissioner [[Bert Bell]] died after suffering a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at Franklin Field during the last two minutes of the game between the Eagles and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NFL History by Decade: 1950-1959|publisher=[[National Football League|NFL]] |url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1951-1960 |accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two infamous incidents in Eagles history occurred at the stadium.

====Santa Claus booed====
During the December 15, 1968 game against the [[Minnesota Vikings]], a Christmas show was planned for halftime. The Eagles had entered the game 2–11, and fans were none too pleased with Eagles quarterback [[Norm Snead]], owner [[Jerry Wolman]], and especially coach [[Joe Kuharich]]: many fans came to the game wearing "Joe Must Go" buttons. Unfortunately, the man meant to play Santa was unable to make it to Franklin Field due to the bad weather. In lieu of the original halftime show, a 19-year-old fan named Frank Olivo (who came to the stadium already wearing a [[Santa Claus]] costume) was invited onto the field to toss candy canes with the cheerleaders. Frustrated by the team, the ugly wet weather, and his unconvincing beard, fans booed Olivo and threw snowballs at him. This incident is often referred to by sportscasters in denigrating Philadelphia sports fans as so mean they booed Santa Claus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ronnie |last=Polaneczky |title=This is Philly: After 40 years, we'll still boo a bad Santa |date=2008-12-15 |work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_update/20081215_Ronnie_Polaneczky__This_is_Philly__After_40_years__we_ll_still_boo_a_bad_Santa.html |accessdate=2008-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216034235/http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_update/20081215_Ronnie_Polaneczky__This_is_Philly__After_40_years__we_ll_still_boo_a_bad_Santa.html |archivedate=December 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eagles lost the game, 24–17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/196812150phi.htm|title=Minnesota Vikings at Philadelphia Eagles – December 15, 1968|accessdate=2009-04-13 |publisher=[[Pro Football Reference]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Olivo continued to attend Eagles games and even made a return as Santa Claus four decades later, at the Eagles' December 27, 2009 game against the [[Denver Broncos]] at [[Lincoln Financial Field]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kerith |last=Gabriel |title='Santa' recalls Eagles 1968 snowball incident |date=2009-12-28 |newspaper=Philadelphia Daily News |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/20091228_Joseph_Santoliquito___Santa__recalls_Eagles_1968_snowball_incident.html |accessdate=2009-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231032211/http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/20091228_Joseph_Santoliquito___Santa__recalls_Eagles_1968_snowball_incident.html |archivedate=December 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Howard Cosell taken ill====
On November 23, 1970, announcer [[Howard Cosell]] was apparently drunk during a nationally televised broadcast of the Eagles-[[New York Giants]] ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game. After throwing up on [[color commentator]] [[Don Meredith]]'s cowboy boots shortly before halftime, Cosell left the stadium and took a taxi back to New York City. Meredith and [[play-by-play]] announcer [[Keith Jackson]] made little mention of his departure during the second half. Later, denying drunkenness, Cosell claimed that he had been dizzy from running laps around Franklin Field's track before the game with track star [[Tommie Smith]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Temple University played its home football games at [[Temple Stadium]] until the late 1970s. Temple Stadium had opened in 1928 and sat up to 34,000 for football.

Temple moved its home games to [[Veterans Stadium]] in the late 1970s but the [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]] had priority for the field for Saturdays during baseball season, which ends the last week in September.

'''Gamo Outdoor [[Sociedad limitada unipersonal|S.L.U]]''', or simply '''Gamo''', is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[airgun]] manufacturer based in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], and is the largest producer of airguns in [[European Union|Europe]] and the largest producer of [[airgun pellet]]s in the world.  The company was founded in 1959, as '''El Gamo''', and airgun production first started in 1961.  Today Gamo products include [[air rifle]]s, [[air pistol]]s, [[ammunition]] and [[optics]].  They produce primarily airguns intended for mass market.

When [[Manganese Bronze Holdings]] liquidated what remained of the gun division of the [[Birmingham Small Arms Company]] in 1986, assets including the logo and the right to use the initials "BSA" were purchased by Gamo{{CN|date=June 2017}} who have continued the air rifle business at Armoury Road, [[Small Heath]], [[Birmingham]] B11 2PP under the name  '''BSA Guns (UK) Limited'''.

During the 1970s in the UK El Gamo marketed two air rifles, the ''Marksman'', a conventional [[.22 caliber|.22]] rifle with a fitted and pre-zeroed telescopic sight, and the ''Paratrooper'' repeater, a [[.177 calibre|.177]] pistol-gripped [[repeating rifle]] incorporating a tubular magazine along the top of the cylinder, and using a rising/falling breech mechanism for positioning the pellet.

'''Hardt Field''', also known in development as the Roadrunner Baseball Complex, is a [[baseball]] [[stadium]] in [[Bakersfield, California]], United States.  It is the home field of the [[Cal State Bakersfield Roadrunners baseball]] team. The stadium is located in the south-west section of the campus of Cal State Bakersfield.

[[File:Hardt Field Bleachers.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Hardt Field, Home Field of the CSUB Roadrunners]]

The stadium was named for Tom and Barbara Hardt. The Hardt Family Trust's $1 million gift and donation of general contracting work supported the construction of the on campus baseball training and playing facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calstate.edu/bot/agendas/jan09/IA.pdf Committee on Institutional Advancement]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first game played in Hardt Field was the inaugural game for the Cal State Bakersfield baseball team on February 20, 2009, between CSUB and [[Saint Louis Billikens baseball|Saint Louis]], with the Billikens beating the Roadrunners 8-7&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorunners.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=13300&amp;ATCLID=3675004 'Runners Nearly Complete Comeback In Season Opener]&lt;/ref&gt; before a sold-out crowd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorunners.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=58070&amp;SPID=6320&amp;DB_OEM_ID=13300&amp;ATCLID=3673608 CSUB Baseball Opener Sold Out; Standing Room Only Tickets Available]&lt;/ref&gt;  Highlights from [[2009 Cal State Bakersfield Roadrunners baseball team|the inaugural (2009) season]] included a walk-off win in the 15th inning over [[UC Riverside Highlanders baseball|UC Riverside]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorunners.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=58071&amp;SPID=6320&amp;DB_OEM_ID=13300&amp;ATCLID=3718433 Kudlock blasts walk-off Home Run in 15-inning thriller.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Also during the 2009 season, Hardt Field was the site of the first time that an NCAA Division I first-year program had defeated the reigning [[College World Series]] champion, when the Roadrunners beat [[Fresno State Bulldogs baseball|Fresno State]] 4-3.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorunners.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=13300&amp;ATCLID=204766232 Pick CSUB Athletics' top moment from Spring 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the start of the [[2013 NCAA Division I baseball season|2013 season]], 750 chairbacked seats were added at the field.&lt;ref name=2012renovs&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Jeff|title=Field to Have 750 Upgraded Seats Installed|url=http://www.bakersfieldcalifornian.com/sports/college/x1012271334/Field-to-have-750-upgraded-seats-installed|work=BakersfieldCalifornian.com|accessdate=20 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6D3nIvQRD|archivedate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dances that make up the '''list of DanceSport dances''' are performed competitively at amateur and professional levels throughout the world. Ten international style [[ballroom dance]]s&amp;mdash;five Standard and five Latin&amp;mdash;are defined by the '''[[World Dance Council]]''' (WDC), which has world-wide membership of all countries taking part in ballroom competitions. 

The WDC incorporates various groupings and former titles, such as  the [[World Dance and DanceSport Council]] (former title). The WDC is the governing body for international professional and amateur DanceSport. The [[World DanceSport Federation]] is, to some extent, a rival body which issues rules for amateur competitions.&lt;ref&gt;See the linked pages for details.&lt;/ref&gt; The list is supplemented by nine American style dances&amp;mdash;four Smooth and five Rhythm&amp;mdash;which are defined by United States dance organizations, such as USA Dance, (formerly USABDA, the United States Amateur Ballroom Dancers Association).&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

Besides determining which dances are performed, these organizations specify many other aspects of their competitions, for instance, the [[tempo]] of music allowed and the duration of each competition round.

== WDC International style dances==
Within World Dance Council international competitions are two categories of dances, ''Ballroom'' (also called Standard or Modern) and ''Latin''.&lt;ref&gt;This is the present WDC terminology.&lt;/ref&gt; In England (e.g. at the [[Blackpool Dance Festival]]), the categories are traditionally called Ballroom and Latin American dances respectively. In the Ballroom dances, men typically wear [[Formal wear|evening dress]] (coattails, waistcoats and [[White tie|white bow ties]]), while women wear gowns. Partners remain in [[closed position]] throughout the dance, and movements tend to be elegant and sweeping. The ballroom dances are progressive, moving anti-clockwise round the floor. 

The Latin dances are more overtly sensual, with skimpy costumes for women and tight-fitting ones for men.&lt;ref&gt;Originally, 1930&amp;ndash;1960, clothing for latin dance was similar to ballroom, with at least dinner jackets and black tie for men, and simple dress for women, with skirts shorter than the ballroom gowns.&lt;/ref&gt; More variation in movement is allowed than in the Standard dances. Close, semi-open and open figures are danced. [[Choreography]] is now extremely important. Hip action - Latin technique is required; and athletic and balletic maneuvers are incorporated which makes it into a DanceSport. Two Latin dances are progressive going counter clockwise  (samba and paso doble), but there is no obligation to consistently move round the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Picart, 89-90, 92-96&lt;/ref&gt;

==American style==

The Smooth and Rhythm categories of American style DanceSport roughly correspond to the Standard and Latin categories of International style. In Smooth, dancers wear costumes not greatly dissimilar to those worn by their counterparts in Standard---Standard dresses often have prominent floats embellishing the arms and fuller skirts which are typically absent in Smooth, due to the open movement and changing arm positions requiring less restriction on the body; however, the dances themselves are significantly different as a result of influence by dancers like [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Arthur Murray]] in the years following [[World War II]].  While elegance and flow remain the goal, as in International Standard, dancers do not remain in [[closed position]] exclusively, instead breaking away from each other periodically and experimenting with open footwork.  The Rhythm dances were also influenced by American dancers of the post-World War II era, but the differences between it and International Latin are more subtle.  Costumes are similar, and while step patterns are not identical, movements are as free and explicitly sensual as in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Picart, 90-95&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3084">The '''Mitre Revolve''' is an [[association football ball]] made by [[Mitre Sports International]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] sports equipment manufacturer. It is the official ball of several [[association football|football]] competitions, including [[The Football League]], the [[Football League Cup]], the [[Football League Trophy]] and the [[Scottish Professional Football League]]. Balls used by teams in the [[Football League Championship]], [[Football League One]] and the Scottish Premiership are all given club-specific colour schemes and the club badge is featured.&lt;ref name="football_league"&gt;{{cite web |title=Football League |url=http://www.mitre.com/football-league.html |work=mitre.com |publisher=Mitre |accessdate=27 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spl"&gt;{{cite web |title=Scottish Premier League |url=http://www.mitre.com/spl.html |work=mitre.com |publisher=Mitre |accessdate=27 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A generic version of the ball is used for clubs in [[Football League Two]].&lt;ref name="football_league"/&gt; Since [[2009 Football League Cup Final|2009]], a variation of the ball with a black-and-goal design has been used for the Football League Cup final. In the Scottish Premier League, the champions from the previous season use a gold-coloured ball in recognition of their status as champions.&lt;ref name="spl"/&gt; A high-visibility version of the ball was developed, in orange with a red and yellow pattern.&lt;ref name="feature_2"&gt;{{cite video |people=Duncan Anderson |date=12 December 2008 |title=Revolve Feature Part 2 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZDYiJN6MfM |format=FLV |publisher=Mitre |accessdate=27 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ball features an outer layer made from [[Clarino]] microfibres and composed of 26 panels, as opposed to the 32-panel designs used by [[Adidas]] and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] amongst others. It is claimed that the 26-panel design allows the ball to maintain its spherical shape better, with the seam pattern also allowing for more accurate control over the flight of the ball.&lt;ref name="feature_1"&gt;{{cite video |people=Duncan Anderson |date=11 December 2008 |title=Revolve Feature Part 1 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZDYiJN6MfM |format=FLV |publisher=Mitre |accessdate=27 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitre also claim that this control is further enhanced by the ball's [[polyurethane]] coating – which keeps the ball dry and provides better grip between boot and ball – and its [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] inner layers – which transfer the momentum from the player's foot to the ball with greater efficiency.&lt;ref name="feature_2"/&gt; The design on the ball's surface is based on thermal images of global wind patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-first=Hugh |editor1-last=Sleight |date=September 2007 |title=World of balls |journal=[[FourFourTwo]] |issue=157 |page=40 |publisher=Haymarket Publishing |location=Teddington |issn=1355-0276 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ice_Hockey_Neutral_Zone_Trap.gif|thumb|200px|In this diagram, the red team is executing a neutral zone trap resulting in the blue team dumping the puck in.]]The '''neutral zone trap''' (often referred to as simply '''the trap''') is a defensive strategy used in [[ice hockey]] to prevent an opposing team from proceeding through the neutral zone (the area between the blue lines) to force turnovers. The strategy is generally used to level the playing field for teams that are not as offensively talented as their opponents, although the trap can also be used by teams simply looking to protect a lead late in the game. The trap was innovated by the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in the 1920s and 1930s but became the defensive scheme for most coaches during the late 90s and early 2000s—known as the "Dead Puck era"—as a direct result of the success seen by the [[New Jersey Devils]] under the coaching of Jacques Lemaire, who perfected the trap defense to 3 Stanley cups in 1995, 2000, and 2003 for the New Jersey Devils. Lemaire utilized the trap that was employed by the Montreal Canadiens under his coach Scotty Bowman.

The most recognizable implementation of the trap sees the defense stationing four of their players in the neutral zone and one [[Ice hockey#Tactics|forechecker]] in the offensive zone. As the offensive team starts to move up the ice, the forechecker (generally the [[Center (ice hockey)|center]]) will cut off passing lanes to other offensive players by staying in the middle of the ice, forcing the puck carrier to either sideboard. The defensive [[Winger (hockey)|wingers]]—typically placed on or near the [[Hockey rink|red line]]—will be positioned by the boards to challenge the puck carrier, prevent passing, or even keep opponents from moving through. The two [[Defenseman (ice hockey)|defencemen]] who are positioned on or near the blue lines are the last defence, and must stall the opposition long enough for the wingers to reset themselves and continue the trap.

The trap has been widely criticized for reducing scoring. It has, however, proven to be very effective, especially in the [[playoffs (ice hockey)|playoffs]]; most recently, the [[Washington Capitals]] employed the neutral zone trap to great effect during their 2018 Stanley Cup run&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/bs-sp-capitals-defense-stanley-cup-final-20180603-story.html|title=Capitals' suffocating pressure frustrating Golden Knights in Stanley Cup Final|last=Whyno|first=Stephen|work=baltimoresun.com|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. During the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]], serious discussion about opening the game to offense was held between the [[NHL]] and [[NHL Players Association]] (NHLPA). Because it is easier to trap when engaging in obstruction and restraining fouls, such as [[hooking (ice hockey)|hooking]] and [[holding (ice hockey)|holding]], which slow the progress of faster players who can evade the trapping team, the NHL ordered officials to call every obstruction penalty, regardless of circumstance. The prohibition on [[two-line pass]]es from behind a team's blue line to the other side of the red line was also lifted. Long passes are one method for breaking out of the trap, as it avoids the need to navigate through defenders in the neutral zone, although it has high rates of turnovers. The NHL also implemented a “Goalkeeper’s Restricted Area”, a trapezoidal area behind the net outside of which goalies cannot play the puck if they are behind the goal line. This allows offenses to more effectively dump the puck past the trap into the corners. Defensive minded teams have reverted to a "third man high" 1–3–1 system where only two offensive players will commit down low, allowing the third to join the defence and impede progress across the blue line.

'''Progressive Field''' is a [[baseball park]] located in the [[downtown Cleveland|downtown area]] of [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], United States. It is the home field of the [[Cleveland Indians]] of [[Major League Baseball]] and, together with [[Quicken Loans Arena]], is part of the [[Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex]].&lt;ref name="Gateway"&gt;{{cite web |title=Gateway Property|url=http://www.gatewaysportscomplex.net/property.html|publisher=Gateway Economic Development Corporation|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was ranked as Major League Baseball's best ballpark in a 2008 ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' fan opinion poll.&lt;ref name = "SI  poll"&gt;{{cite news |title=MLB Ballpark Rankings: Cleveland Indians|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/specials/fansurvey/2008/indians.html|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=April 2008|accessdate=May 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ballpark opened as '''Jacobs Field''' in [[1994 Cleveland Indians season|1994]] to replace [[Cleveland Stadium]], which the team had shared with the [[Cleveland Browns]] of the [[National Football League]]. Since 2008, the facility has been named for [[Progressive Corporation]], based in the Cleveland suburb of [[Mayfield, Ohio|Mayfield]], which purchased [[naming rights]] for $58 million over 16 years. The previous name came from team owners [[Richard Jacobs (businessman)|Richard and David Jacobs]], who had acquired naming rights when the facility opened. The ballpark is still often referred to as "The Jake", based on its original name.&lt;ref name=pd20110402&gt;{{cite news |title=Few Fans and Less Pitching Haunt Cleveland Indians in 8-3 Loss to Chicago White Sox|first=Paul|last=Hoynes|url=http://www.cleveland.com/tribe/index.ssf/2011/04/few_fans_and_less_pitching_hau.html|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|location=Cleveland|date=April 2, 2011|accessdate=April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it opened, the listed seating capacity was 42,865 people and between 1995 and 2001 the team sold out 455 consecutive regular-season games. Modifications over the years resulted in several moderate changes to the capacity, peaking at 45,569 in 2010. After the 2014 and 2015 seasons, the facility was renovated in two phases, which upgraded and reconfigured several areas of the park and reduced seating capacity. As of 2018, seating capacity is listed at 35,041 people&lt;ref name="2018cliarb"&gt;{{cite book |title=2018 Cleveland Indians Information and Record Book|first1=Bart|last1=Swain|first2=Court|last2=Berry-Tripp|first3=Ryan|last3=Milowicki|first4=Nina|last4=Zimmerman|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/371231719/2018-CLE-Media-Guide|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=April 3, 2017|accessdate=May 23, 2018|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;, though additional fans can be accommodated through standing room areas and temporary seating.

Since moving to Progressive Field, the Indians have won 10 [[American League Central|Central Division]] titles and have hosted playoff games in 10 seasons, the most recent being in 2017. Progressive Field is one of the few facilities in baseball history to host the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] and games of the [[World Series]] in the same season, which occurred in [[1997 Cleveland Indians season|1997]]. The Indians have hosted games of the [[American League Championship Series]] in five seasons and have advanced to the [[World Series]] three times at the park.

==History==
The Cleveland Indians previously played home games at [[Cleveland Stadium]], which they shared with the [[Cleveland Browns]] of the [[National Football League]]. The Indians first played at the stadium, which seated nearly 80,000 people for baseball, for the 1932 and 1933 seasons, but returned to smaller [[League Park]] for most games in 1934. From 1936 to 1946, they played weekend and holiday games at Cleveland Stadium, and eventually night games and other dates where larger crowds were expected, moving to the stadium full-time in 1947. Cleveland Stadium was the largest stadium in the [[American League]] during its tenure as a baseball facility and was the largest stadium in [[Major League Baseball]] for all but a few seasons.&lt;ref name="CMS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cleveland Municipal Stadium|url=http://ech.cwru.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=CMS5|work=Encyclopedia of Cleveland History|publisher=Western Reserve Historical Society|date=November 25, 2002|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been a symbol of the Indians' glory years of the 1940s and 1950s, attracting some of the largest crowds in baseball history. However, during the team's lean years from the 1960s through the early 1990s, even crowds of 40,000 people were swallowed up in the environment. As a result, the Indians began pressing for a new stadium.

Plans for a new stadium first began in 1984 when [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]] voters defeated a property tax for building a 100% publicly funded domed stadium, which would have been shared by the Indians and Browns. Later that year, committee leaders met to re-evaluate these plans, and a location was later agreed upon. The eventual site of the stadium, the location of the Central Market, was acquired in December 1985. In April 1986, designs for the new stadium were agreed upon and about a year later, demolition at the site started.&lt;ref name="Progressive Field PDF"/&gt; Cuyahoga County voters approved a 15-year [[sin tax]] on alcohol and cigarette sales in May 1990 to finance the new [[Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex]], which included the ballpark, [[Quicken Loans Arena|an adjacent arena]] for the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), and two parking garages.&lt;ref name="1990 tax"&gt;{{cite news |title=1990 Sin Tax|url=http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20120227/SUB1/302279977|work=Crains Cleveland Business|date=February 27, 2012|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction started in January 1992, and by May of that year, the concrete construction had been poured. In June 1992, [[Mel Harder]], who pitched the opening game at Cleveland Stadium in 1932,&lt;ref name="Mel Harder"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mel Harder|url=http://www.clevelandseniors.com/people/melharder.htm|publisher=Bob Becker|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contemporary stars [[Charles Nagy]] and [[Sandy Alomar, Jr.]], executed the ceremonial first pitch at the site of the new ballpark before construction began. The installation of seating was completed in October 1993. The ballpark, which was referred to as "Cleveland Indians Baseball Park" and "Indians Park" on blueprints, cost approximately $175 million to build, of which $91 million was provided by Indians owner Richard Jacobs. The remaining $84 million was raised by the sin tax.&lt;ref name="Construction PDF"/&gt;

An open house was held April 1, 1994, and the following day, an exhibition game was held against the [[1994 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ballpark gets rave reviews |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=Daily Kent Stater |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first official game was held April 4. U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] threw out the ceremonial first pitch, and the Indians defeated the [[1994 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] 4–3 in 11 innings in front of a crowd of 41,459 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cleveland Indians' 5 most memorable home openers at Progressive Field (poll) |url=http://www.cleveland.com/tribe/index.ssf/2013/04/cleveland_indians_5_memorable.html |date=April 7, 2013 |author=Peticca, Mike |newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]] |accessdate=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ballpark was the first new major sporting facility to open in Cleveland since [[Cleveland Arena]] opened in 1937. During that inaugural and strike-shortened [[1994 Cleveland Indians season|1994 season]], the Indians finished 35–16 at home, which included an 18-game home winning streak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1994 Cleveland Indians Schedule and Results |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CLE/1994-schedule-scores.shtml |work=Baseball-Reference.com |year=2016 |accessdate=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Progressive Field PDF"/&gt;

The ballpark hosted playoff games for the first time in [[1995 Major League Baseball season|1995]] as the Indians ended a 41-year playoff drought. The first playoff game was on October 3, a 5–4 win in 11 innings over the [[1995 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] in Game 1 of the [[1995 American League Division Series#Boston vs. Cleveland|American League Division Series]]. Jacobs Field also played host to Games 3, 4, and 5 of the [[1995 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] against the [[1995 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] and Games 3, 4, and 5 of the [[1995 World Series]] against the [[1995 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]]. Two years later, Jacobs Field hosted its first [[1997 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] and the first All Star Game in Cleveland since 1981. Later that year, the Indians hosted Games 3, 4, and 5 of the [[1997 World Series]] against the [[1997 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]]. It was the tenth time in Major League history the All-Star Game and games of the World Series were played in the same facility in the same season, and the first time since 1977. The longest home run in ballpark history was hit by [[Jim Thome]] on July 3, 1999, measured at {{Convert|511|ft|m|0}} to center field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=All-Star Game |work=Baseball Almanac |year=2015 |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/asgmenu.shtml |accessdate=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Progressive Field PDF"/&gt;

During the eighth inning of Game 2 of the [[2007 American League Division Series]] against the [[2007 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] on October 5, a swarm of insects believed to be midges from [[Lake Erie]], enveloped the playing field, severely distracting Yankees relief pitcher [[Joba Chamberlain]], which caused him to walk outfielder [[Grady Sizemore]], who later scored the tying run on a wild pitch. The incident became known as the "[[Bug Game]]"; however, this was not the first time the insects plagued Jacobs Field.&lt;ref name="bug game"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bugs Disrupt Yankees-Indians in Late Innings|agency=Associated Press|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/21157338/|work=[[NBC Sports]]|date=October 5, 2007|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attendance records==
Progressive Field set a new MLB record between June 12, 1995 and April 4, 2001 in selling out 455 straight games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Indians' Record-Setting Sellout Streak Over|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/indians/2001-04-04-sellout.htm|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=April 5, 2001|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demand for tickets was so great that all 81 home games were sold out before opening day in five separate seasons.&lt;ref name="Progressive Field PDF"/&gt; The Indians [[Cleveland Indians#Retired numbers|retired]] the number 455 in honor of the sellout record.

==Naming rights==
[[File:JacobsField2.jpg|thumb|right|View from Right Field]]
Naming rights were acquired in 1994 by team owner [[Richard Jacobs (businessman)|Richard Jacobs]], who paid for rights until the end of 2006. The Jacobs Field name gave rise to the nickname "The Jake" for the ballpark.&lt;ref name="new name"&gt;{{cite web|title=Indians Find Progressive Partner|url=http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080111&amp;content_id=2343558&amp;vkey=news_cle&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cle|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=January 11, 2008|accessdate=July 12, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115135135/http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080111&amp;content_id=2343558&amp;vkey=news_cle&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cle|archivedate=January 15, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indians announced on January 11, 2008, that naming rights to the park had been purchased by [[Progressive Corporation]], a major insurance company headquartered in the nearby suburb of [[Mayfield, Ohio]], for $58 million over 16 years.&lt;ref name="new name"/&gt;&lt;ref name=progressive&gt;{{cite news |title=Indians sell field's naming rights for $58 million over 16 years |url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=3191639 |agency=Associated Press |work=ESPN.com |date=January 11, 2008 |accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indians extended their lease agreement with Gateway Economic Development Corp. for the stadium in August 2008 from 2013 to 2023. The agreement gives the team four five-year renewal options after 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Deal Keeps Cleveland Indians at Progressive Field Until at Least 2023|first=Henry J.|last=Gomez|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2008/08/deal_keeps_cleveland_indians_a.html|newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]]|location=Cleveland|date=August 6, 2008|accessdate=August 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Progressive Field Flag.jpg|thumb|right|Pregame festivities at game one of the [[2007 American League Division Series]] ]]
The ballpark was designed by HOK Sport, now known as [[Populous (company)|Populous]], a division of [[Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum]]. HOK designed it as the second [[Baseball park#Retro-modern ballparks|retro-modern ballpark]],&lt;ref name="retro modern"&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 30 MLB Stadiums|url=http://www.neontommy.com/news/2012/03/power-ranking-mlb-stadiums-0|publisher=Jeremy Bergman|date=March 28, 2012|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with asymmetrical fences of varying heights, a smaller upper deck, and stepped tiers. It is similar to HOK's [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]] in Baltimore, which was the first retro-modern ballpark. The ballpark was sited to give a favorable view of Cleveland's downtown skyline. The structural engineering was done by a Cleveland company, [[Osborn Engineering]], which helped design [[League Park]], [[Cleveland Stadium|Cleveland Municipal Stadium]], [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|"Old" Yankee Stadium]] and [[Fenway Park]].&lt;ref name="Osborn"&gt;{{cite web |title=Portfolio|url=http://www.osborn-eng.com/Portfolio.aspx|publisher=Osborn Engineering|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed to blend in with the city of Cleveland with its exposed steel design and the vertical light towers  that match the smoke stacks of Cleveland’s industrial zone.&lt;ref name="Ballparks of Baseball"&gt;{{cite web |title=Progressive Field at Ballparks of Baseball|url=http://www.ballparksofbaseball.com/al/ProgressiveField.htm|publisher=Ballparks of Baseball|accessdate=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Progressive Field view from above visitor dugout.jpg|thumb|right|A view from the lower deck, with [[Quicken Loans Arena]] and the [[Terminal Tower]] in the background. The Terrace Club is behind the windows to the left of the foul pole.]]
The ballpark has numerous unique structural features. The field is situated on {{convert|12|acres|adj=on}} of [[Poa pratensis|Kentucky Bluegrass]].&lt;ref name="Progressive Field PDF"/&gt; It is illuminated by 19 white vertical light towers; three behind the scoreboard, six behind first base, six behind third base and four in right field, which stand {{convert|200|ft|m}} above street level and {{convert|218|ft|m}} above the playing field and are said to resemble oversized toothbrushes.

The bullpens, reconfigured between the 2014 and 2015 seasons, are raised above the playing field, which allows fans to see pitchers warming up. Both bullpens are located adjacent to section 103 behind right-center field, with the Indians' bullpen closer to the field.&lt;ref name="Progressive Field PDF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ballparks.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ballparks.com/baseball/american/jacobs.htm |title=Progressive Field information |accessdate=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the majority of ballparks, the Indians' dugout is along the third base line and the visitors' dugout is located along the first base line.&lt;ref name="progressive.com"/&gt; When the ballpark was built it contained 121 [[luxury box]]es.

==Renovations==

The team announced the first phase of renovation plans for Progressive Field in late 2014, which were completed prior to the start of the [[2015 Cleveland Indians season|2015 season]]. The area on either side of the right field gate, previously known as "Gate C", was reconfigured, with a pedestrian bridge and concession buildings removed to open the views of the surrounding neighborhood. The statue of [[Jim Thome]] was moved to the area, while the statue of [[Bob Feller]] was moved to a new location in the area, and a new statue of [[Larry Doby]] was added. A two-story bar named "The Corner" was built, providing better views of the field as the Batter's Eye Bar was often overcrowded on summer days. The bullpens, which had previously been separate, were relocated to the right center field area, allowing fans closer views of players warming up. To allow more light in the right field concourse, the mezzanine deck was reduced by several rows to open the area. The Kid's Clubhouse was made two stories, and adults are now able to view the game from the clubhouse. Seating in the upper deck behind right field and down the first base line was removed and replaced with terraces, available for use by large groups. Additional changes included installation of new concession areas and options, many of which are from Cleveland-area eateries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bob Feller statue moves to temporary Progressive Field location |url=http://www.cleveland.com/tribe/index.ssf/2014/10/bob_feller_statue_moves_to_tem.html |newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]] |date=October 7, 2014 |author=Harnocz, Amanda |accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Progressive Field renovations continue to take shape |url=http://www.foxsports.com/ohio/story/cleveland-indians-progressive-field-renovations-031215 |work=FoxSports.com |author=Reedy, Joe |date=March 12, 2015 |accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the opening of the [[2016 Cleveland Indians season|2016 season]], the next phase of renovations was completed, which included the addition of a new club area behind home plate for season ticket holders, the installation of a new scoreboard system and additional scoreboards, new standing room areas in the left field area, and additional concession areas, again using local-based eateries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Progressive Field renovations on track for Opening Day |url=http://www.cleveland.com/tribe/index.ssf/2016/01/cleveland_indians_renovations.html |newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]] |date=January 28, 2016 |accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ballpark became the 11th MLB facility to have [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] field lights installed, which was done prior to the start of the 2017 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tribe's outlook is even brighter: Club is adding LED field lights for 2017 |url=http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20170129/NEWS/170129814/tribes-outlook-is-even-brighter-club-is-adding-led-field-lights-for |date=January 29, 2017 |work=Crain's Cleveland Business |author=Kleps, Kevin |accessdate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wi-Fi]] was also installed throughout the ballpark prior to the start of the 2017 season.

==Amenities==
[[File:Progressive Field beer stand.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pabst Blue Ribbon]] concession stand at Progressive Field.]]
The ballpark features several eateries from which spectators can watch the game. A glass-enclosed multilevel restaurant named the "Terrace Club" is located along the left field foul line on the suite level. Spectators need a valid game ticket and a pass to enter into the Terrace Club. On non-game days it is used for private and corporate events, such as business meetings, parties and weddings.&lt;ref name="about.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Progressive Field|url=http://cleveland.about.com/od/clevelandindiansbaseball/p/jacobsfield.htm|publisher=About.com|year=2010|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TC membership"&gt;{{cite web |title=Progressive Field Terrace Club Membership|url=http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/cle/ticketing/season_tickets/season_terraceclub.jsp|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Budweiser Patio" is a buffet eatery used mostly for corporate or private parties, located just behind the right field foul pole between the visitors' bullpen and section 117.&lt;ref name="new offerings"&gt;{{cite web |title=New Offerings at Progressive Field|first=Anthony|last=Castrovince|url=http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/news/print.jsp?ymd=20100402&amp;content_id=9057374&amp;vkey=news_cle&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cle|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=April 2, 2010|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new children's play area named "Kids Clubhouse", located on the mezzanine level, opened in May 2012.

==Non-baseball events==

===Hockey===
On January 15, 2012, the park hosted its first [[ice hockey]] game, a match between the [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's ice hockey|Ohio State Buckeyes]] and the [[Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey|Michigan Wolverines]], the first outdoor college hockey game in Ohio.&lt;ref name="Snow Days 2011"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cleveland Indians Announce Return of Indians Snow Days Featuring College Hockey Game at Progressive Field|url=http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20110811&amp;content_id=23078912&amp;vkey=pr_cle&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cle|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=August 11, 2011|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerts===
Progressive Field is occasionally used as a concert venue. It was first used for a concert on August 12, 1995 during its second season of use, when [[Jimmy Buffett]] played at the ballpark as part of his Domino College Tour. The panels set on the outfield grass to hold the stage, however, caused visible damage to the playing surface, leading Indians owner Richard Jacobs to ban concerts at the facility.&lt;ref name=concerts&gt;{{cite news |title=Progressive Field ready for challenge of concerts in back-to-back days |url=http://www.wkyc.com/article/entertainment/music/progressive-field-ready-for-challenge-of-concerts-in-back-to-back-days/456879380 |work=WKYC.com |date=July 14, 2017 |accessdate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerts returned to the ballpark in 2011 when the Indians hosted the Indians Music Festival, which featured [[Brad Paisley]] and [[Blake Shelton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Brad Paisley to headline Indians Music Festival Saturday at Progressive Field |url=http://www.cleveland.com/music/index.ssf/2011/06/brad_paisley_to_headline_india.html |date=June 8, 2011 |author=Yarborough, Chuck |newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]] |accessdate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, in 2014, [[Jason Aldean]] played at Progressive Field as part of his [[Burn It Down Tour]], a performance that drew 40,516 fans and included [[Florida Georgia Line]], [[Miranda Lambert]], and [[Tyler Farr]]. In 2017, the ballpark hosted two concerts on consecutive nights, with [[Billy Joel]] performing on July 14 as part of [[Billy Joel in Concert]], followed the next night by [[Luke Bryan]] and his [[Huntin', Fishin' and Lovin' Every Day Tour]].&lt;ref name=concerts/&gt;

===Other events===
An event called "Snow Days" debuted at Progressive Field in November 2010. The first day, called "Snopening Day", was held on November 26 and the event continued until January 2, 2011. An ice skating track called the "Frozen Mile" was installed around the warning track, the "Batterhorn" was a [[snow tubing]] hill on the [[bleachers]] and other events were staged around the field and home run porch.&lt;ref name="Snow Days 2010"&gt;{{cite web |title=Indians Snow Days are coming to Progressive Field|url=http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20100923&amp;content_id=14992478&amp;vkey=pr_cle&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cle|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=September 23, 2010|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Snow Days" returned in November 2011, and closed on January 16. The Batterhorn was moved to the Toyota Home Run porch and the Frozen Mile was rerouted. The park also added the "Frozen Diamond", an ice rink covering the infield. On June 1, 2012, it was announced that "Snow Days" would not run in 2012 due to low attendance in 2011.  In part, this was caused by the warmest winter on record, with temperatures of {{convert|60|°F|°C}} on "Snopening Day."&lt;ref name="Snow Days cancelled"&gt;{{cite news |title=Snow Days at Progressive Field Cancelled|first=Michael|last=McIntyre|url=http://www.cleveland.com/tipoff/index.ssf/2012/06/cleveland_indians_will_not_rep.html|newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]]|location=Cleveland|date=June 1, 2012|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Climbing.reverso.jpg|thumb|Reverso]]
[[File:Petzl reverso 3, Arak.jpg|thumb|Reverso&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in use]]

A '''Reverso''' is a [[belay device]] developed and patented by [[Petzl]], used for example in [[rock-climbing]] and other activities which involves rope-work. Another version of this device is the Reversino, intended for use with thinner ropes.

A Reverso can be used to belay the leader, one or two seconds, or as a descender during [[rappelling]]. It can also be used in self-braking mode, to belay one or two seconds, if attached directly to the belay.

A Reverso is similar in design and use to an [[ATC (belay device)|ATC]] when belaying a lead climber from below. A rope passes through the Reverso, through a carabiner attached to both the Reverso and the belayer's harness, and back through the same hole in the Reverso. This creates the friction required to properly belay a climber.

When belaying a seconder from the top of a climb, the Reverso is attached by a [[carabiner]] through the "extra loop" that an [[ATC (belay device)|ATC]] does not have, to the anchors in the place of an [[italian hitch]] knot. Using this method, the device is self-locking, and cannot be released without extra gear.

The '''Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi''' is a stadium in [[Verona]], [[Italy]]. It is the home of [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Hellas Verona]] and [[A.C. ChievoVerona|ChievoVerona]] of [[Serie B]] and [[Serie A]], respectively.

Inaugurated as a state-of-the-art facility and as one of Italy's finest venues in 1963, the stadium appeared excessive for a team (Hellas) that had spent the best part of the previous 35 years in Serie B. For the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] renovations included an extra tier and a roof to cover all sections, improved visibility, public transport connections, an urban motorway connecting the city centre with the stadium and the Verona Nord motorway exit and services.

A [[Building-integrated photovoltaics|building-integrated]] [[Photovoltaic system|PV system]] has been installed on the rooftop during a major renovation. The PV system has a rating of 999.5&amp;nbsp;kW. 13,321 "FS 275" [[Thin film solar cell|thin-film]] [[cadmium telluride]] (CdTe) [[Solar panel|solar modules]] by First Solar Inc. have been mounted on the aluminum [[Photovoltaic mounting system|mounting system]] Riverclack by ISCOM SpA. The solar modules are connected to 141 Sunny Mini Central SMC 7000HV [[Grid-tie inverter|inverters]] by [[SMA Solar Technology| SMA Solar Technology AG]]. The system was commissioned at the end of November 2009.&lt;ref name=Eleuteri&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eleuteri|first=Stefano|title=Arena fotovoltaico|journal=PHOTON – Il Mensile del Fotovoltaico|volume=2009|issue=October|pages=152–156|url=http://www.photon-online.it/archiv/article.aspx?criteria=13&amp;HeftNr=1009&amp;id=24703&amp;pub=13|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of Chievo on the Serie A stage in recent years has split the city into two groups of archrival fans, both very loyal to their respective cause, these days with Chievo constantly battling to survive relegation in Serie A, and Hellas Verona just returning in the top tier after a four-year spell in the third division, after having won a ''scudetto'' in 1985.

Despite playing two divisions lower than Chievo and missing out on travelling supporters from the large Serie A teams, Hellas Verona the city's traditionally bigger team still managed to maintain higher average attendances than their rival during the 2009–10 season. In the 2013–14 season, [[Virtus Verona]] also played at the Bentegodi.

The '''Stadio San Nicola''' ({{lang-en|Saint Nicholas Stadium}}) is a multi-use all-seater stadium designed by [[Renzo Piano]] in [[Bari]], Italy.  It is currently used mostly for [[association football|football]] matches and is the home stadium of [[F.C. Bari 1908]]. The stadium itself resembles a 'flower'. To create this particular design, the stadium consists of 26 'petals' and upper tiers of the higher ring which are separated by 8-metre empty spaces, sufficient to guarantee satisfactory security conditions.

The stadium holds 58,248 people, and was filled to capacity for the first time during a 2013–2014 Serie B playoff match for A.S. Bari in June, 2014. Prior to that, the largest attendance at the stadium was 52,000 for an A.S. Bari Serie A match during the 2009–10 season.

The stadium was built in 1990 for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], during which it hosted five matches: [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] vs. [[Romania national football team|Romania]], [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] vs. [[Romania national football team|Romania]], and [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] vs. [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] in group B action; in the round of 16 matches, [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] vs. [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]; and the third place match between [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[England national football team|England]].

It hosted the [[1991 European Cup Final]], won by [[Red Star Belgrade]]. It was also the venue for the [[1997 Mediterranean Games]].

The stadium hosted the [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group B]] between Italy and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in March 2007, which Italy won 2–0, and was also a deciding match for the [[Unofficial World Football Championships]].

The Stadio San Nicola hosted Italy's [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]] against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] on 1 April 2009. Italy were booed off the field after Ireland shocked the nation by scoring in the 87th minute. The match ended in a 1–1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7975559.stm|title=Italy 1–1 Republic of Ireland|date=1 April 2009|work=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=1 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TV Amriswil Volleyball''' is one of four major divisions of '''TV Amriswil''', a sports club located in [[Switzerland]]. The [[volleyball]] division consists of a semi-professional indoor men's team and a number of casual men, women, and juniors teams.

The A-grade men's team has established itself as a top-tier Swiss team in the early 1990s and has continuously finished the Swiss championships in top ranks ever since.

On an international scale, the club has qualified for and participated in European Cups many times since 1995, while various players of the squad represent Switzerland as players in the Swiss national team.
