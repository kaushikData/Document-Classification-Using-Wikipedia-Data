[[File:Joaquín_Torres_García_-_América_Invertida.jpg|thumb]]
'''América Invertida''' is a 1943 pen and ink drawing by Spanish-Uruguayan artist [[Joaquín Torres García]].   

== The Image ==
The image features a depiction of South America which has been turned from its standard depiction and instead oriented [[South-up map orientation|with the south at the top]].   

== Context and purpose ==
Torres García's creation of the image was connected to his efforts to form a theory of "constructive universalism," meaning contemporary art that was influenced by the traditions of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UJ-Qj-Sx4RoC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=Am%C3%A9rica+Invertida&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB5dy6sIrVAhUHxoMKHUPVCaEQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Am%C3%A9rica%20Invertida&amp;f=false|title=The Oxford Book of Latin American Poetry: A Bilingual Anthology|last=Vicuña|first=Cecilia|last2=Livon-Grosman|first2=Ernesto|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195124545|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With this depiction of South America, Torres García is proposing the creation of an autonomous Latin American art movement. This is closely related to his manifesto "The School of the South" in which he states “I have called this “The School of the South” because in reality, our north is the south. There must not be north for us, except in opposition to our south. Therefore we now turn the map upside down, and then we have a true idea of our position, and not as the rest of the world wishes. The point of America, from now on, forever, insistently points to the South, our north.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wordsinspace.net/urban-media-archaeology/2011-fall/2011/11/30/inverted-map-of-south-america/|title=Inverted Map of South America {{!}} Urban Media Archaeology|website=www.wordsinspace.net|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have interpreted the image as a sociopolitical artistic work intended to counter American [[cultural imperialism]] and other cartographic and cultural norms rooted in the [[History of colonialism|European colonization]] of the Americas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rsmLAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=Am%C3%A9rica+Invertida+torres+garcia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGmLzWsIrVAhWX2YMKHSCxAtwQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Am%C3%A9rica%20Invertida%20torres%20garcia&amp;f=false|title=Place and Politics in Latin American Digital Culture: Location and Latin American Net Art|last=Taylor|first=Claire|date=2014-05-09|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317912088|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iyMY_YhTN4IC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=Am%C3%A9rica+Invertida+torres+garcia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGmLzWsIrVAhWX2YMKHSCxAtwQ6AEIPzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Am%C3%A9rica%20Invertida%20torres%20garcia&amp;f=false|title=Latin American Identity in Online Cultural Production|last=Pitman|first=Thea|last2=Taylor|first2=Claire|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415517447|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work has become an iconic in Uruguayan popular culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Antisemitism may be manifested in many ways, ranging from expressions of hatred of or discrimination against individual Jews to organized [[pogrom]]s by mobs, state police, or even military attacks on entire Jewish communities. Although the term did not come into common usage until the 19th century, it is now also applied to historic anti-Jewish incidents. Notable instances of [[Persecution of Jews|persecution]] include the [[Rhineland massacres]] preceding the [[First Crusade]] in 1096, the [[Edict of Expulsion]] from England in 1290, the [[History of the Jews in Spain#Massacres and mass conversions of 1391|massacres of Spanish Jews]] in 1391, the persecutions of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion from Spain]] in 1492, the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising#Jews|Cossack massacres in Ukraine]] from 1648 to 1657, various [[anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]] between 1821 and 1906, the 1894–1906 [[Dreyfus affair]] in France, [[the Holocaust]] in [[Nazi Germany|German-occupied Europe]] during [[World War II]], [[antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Soviet anti-Jewish policies]], and Arab and Muslim involvement in the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]].

The root word ''[[Wikt:Semite|Semite]]'' gives the [[misnomer|false impression]] that antisemitism is directed against all [[Semitic people]], ''e.g.'', including [[Arabs]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]. The compound word ''antisemite'' was popularized in Germany in 1879{{sfn|Bein|1990|p=595}} as a scientific-sounding term for ''Judenhass'' ("Jew-hatred"),{{sfn|Chanes|2004|p=150}}{{sfn|Rattansi|2007|p=4–5}}{{sfn|Roth|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Johnston|1983|p=27}}&lt;ref name=laqueur1&gt;{{harvp|Laqueur|2006}}.

[[File:Statuten der Antisemiten-Liga.jpg|thumb|1879 statute of the Antisemitic League]]

The origin of "antisemitic" terminologies is found in the responses of [[Moritz Steinschneider]] to the views of [[Ernest Renan]]. As [[Alex Bein]] writes: "The compound anti-Semitism appears to have been used first by Steinschneider, who challenged Renan on account of his 'anti-Semitic prejudices' [i.e., his derogation of the "Semites" as a [[Race (human categorization)|race]]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQOn0y8ENg4C&amp;pg=PA594 |last=Bein |first=Alex |author-link=Alex Bein |title=The Jewish Question: Biography of a World Problem |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |year=1990 |page=594 |isbn=0-8386-3252-1 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avner Falk]] similarly writes: 'The German word ''antisemitisch'' was first used in 1860 by the Austrian Jewish scholar Moritz Steinschneider (1816–1907) in the phrase ''antisemitische Vorurteile'' (antisemitic prejudices). Steinschneider used this phrase to characterise the French philosopher Ernest Renan's false ideas about how "[[Semitic people#Ethnicity and race|Semitic races]]" were inferior to "[[Aryan race]]s"'.&lt;ref name="'The ''antisemitisch'' 18 60 (1816-1907) ''antisemitische Vorurteile'' (antisemitic prejudices).

[[Pseudoscience|Pseudoscientific]] theories concerning race, civilization, and "progress" had become quite widespread in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, especially as [[Prussia]]n nationalistic historian [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] did much to promote this form of racism. He coined the phrase "the Jews are our misfortune" which would later be widely used by [[Nazism|Nazis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Poliakov |first=Léon |author-link=Léon Poliakov |title=The History of Anti-Semitism, Vol. 3: From Voltaire to Wagner |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2003 |page=404 |isbn=978-0-8122-1865-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Avner Falk, Treitschke uses the term "Semitic" almost synonymously with "Jewish", in contrast to Renan's use of it to refer to a whole range of peoples,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Falk |first=Avner |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWL4ja2BbnEC&amp;pg=PA21 |title=Anti-Semitism: A History and Psychoanalysis of Contemporary Hatred |location=Westport, Conn. |publisher=Praeger |page=21 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; based generally on linguistic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brustein |first=William I. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hc3HabBQsdsC&amp;pg=PA118 |title=Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe before the Holocaust |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |page=118 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jonathan M. Hess, the term was originally used by its authors to "stress the radical difference between their own 'antisemitism' and earlier forms of antagonism toward Jews and Judaism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jonathan M. |last=Hess |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/18229 |title=Johann David Michaelis and the Colonial Imaginary: Orientalism and the Emergence of Racial Antisemitism in Eighteenth-Century Germany |journal=Jewish Social Studies |volume=6 |number=2 |date=Winter 2000 |pages=56–101 |doi=10.1353/jss.2000.0003 |quote=When the term "antisemitism" was first introduced in Germany in the late 1870s, those who used it did so in order to stress the radical difference between their own "antisemitism" and earlier forms of antagonism toward Jews and Judaism. |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bookcover-1880-Marr-German uber Juden.jpg|thumb|Cover page of Marr's ''The Way to Victory of Germanicism over Judaism'', 1880 edition]]

In 1879 German journalist [[Wilhelm Marr]] published a pamphlet, ''Der Sieg des Judenthums über das Germanenthum. Vom nicht confessionellen Standpunkt aus betrachtet'' (''The Victory of the Jewish Spirit over the Germanic Spirit. Observed from a non-religious perspective'') in which he used the word ''Semitismus'' interchangeably with the word ''Judentum'' to denote both "Jewry" (the Jews as a collective) and "jewishness" (the quality of being Jewish, or the Jewish spirit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaspal |first=Rusi |year=2014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qS_jBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT38 |title=Antisemitism and Anti-Zionism: Representation, Cognition and Everyday Talk |location=Farnham, Surrey |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |chapter=Antisemitism: Conceptual Issues |access-date=27 October 2018}} Jaspal erroneously gives the date of publication as 1873.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Marr|Marr, Wilhelm]].

Rudolph Costenoble. 1879, 8th edition/printing. Archive.org. Marr uses the word "Semitismus" (Semitism) on pages 7, 11, 14, 30, 32, and 46; for example, one finds in the conclusion the following passage: "Ja, ich bin überzeutgt, ich habe ausgesprochen, was Millionen Juden im Stillen denken: Dem Semitismus gehört die Weltherrschaft!" (Yes, I am convinced that I have articulated what millions of Jews are quietly thinking: World domination belongs to Semitism!) (p. 46).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marr |first=Wilhem |author-link=Wilhelm Marr |url=http://www.kevinmacdonald.net/Marr-Text-English.pdf |title=The Victory of Judaism over Germanism: Viewed from a Nonreligious Point of View |translator-first=Gerhard |translator-last=Rohringer |year=1879 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of ''[[Wikt:Semitismus|Semitismus]]'' was followed by a coining of "[[Wikt:Antisemitismus|Antisemitismus]]" which was used to indicate opposition to the Jews as a people{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} and opposition to the Jewish spirit, which Marr interpreted as infiltrating German culture. His next pamphlet, ''Der Weg zum Siege des Germanenthums über das Judenthum'' (''The Way to Victory of the Germanic Spirit over the Jewish Spirit'', 1880), presents a development of Marr's ideas further and may present the first published use of the German word '' Antisemitismus'', "antisemitism".

The pamphlet became very popular, and in the same year he founded the ''Antisemiten-Liga'' (League of Antisemites),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wilhelm Marr |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/wilhelm-marr |website=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; apparently named to follow the "Anti-Kanzler-Liga" (Anti-Chancellor League).&lt;ref name="MZ1987"/&gt; The league was the first German organization committed specifically to combating the alleged threat to Germany and German culture posed by the Jews and their influence, and advocating their [[population transfer|forced removal]] from the country.

So far as can be ascertained, the word was first widely printed in 1881, when Marr published ''Zwanglose Antisemitische Hefte'', and [[Wilhelm Scherer]] used the term ''Antisemiten'' in the January issue of ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]''.

The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] reports, "In February 1881, a correspondent of the ''[[Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums]]'' speaks of 'Anti-Semitism' as a designation which recently came into use ("Allg. Zeit. d. Jud." 1881, p.&amp;nbsp;138). On 19 July 1882, the editor says, 'This quite recent Anti-Semitism is hardly three years old.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Jewish Encyclopedia |title=Anti-Semitism |first=Gotthard |last=Deutsch |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1603-anti-semitism  |publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls |page=641 (A) |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The related term "[[Philo-Semitism|philosemitism]]" was coined around 1885.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Usage===
From the outset the term anti-Semitism bore special racial connotations and meant specifically prejudice against [[Jews]].&lt;ref name="MWdef" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JustJews" /&gt; The term is confusing, for in modern usage 'Semitic' designates a language group, not a race. In this sense, the term is a misnomer, since there are many speakers of [[Semitic languages]] (e.g. [[Arabs]], [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiopians]], and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]) who are not the objects of anti-Semitic prejudices, while there are many Jews who do not speak [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a Semitic language. Though 'antisemitism' has been used to describe [[prejudice]] against people who speak other Semitic languages,  the validity of such usage has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Benjamin |last=Isaac |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eem1AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA442 |title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2004 |page=442 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=David Matas |last=Matas |first=David |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYR7SqcMe9gC&amp;pg=PA34 |title=Aftershock: Anti-Zionism and Antisemitism |publisher=Dundurn Press |year=2005 |page=34 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|1999|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term may be spelled with or without a hyphen (antisemitism or anti-Semitism). Some scholars favor the unhyphenated form because, "If you use the hyphenated form, you consider the words 'Semitism', 'Semite', 'Semitic' as meaningful" whereas "in antisemitic parlance, 'Semites' really stands for Jews, just that."&lt;ref name="Almog"&gt;{{cite web |last=Almog |first=Shmuel |url=https://astro.temple.edu/~hfreiden/Antisemitism/whatis.htm |title=What's in a Hyphen? |access-date=27 October 2018}}, SICSA Report: Newsletter of the [[Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism]] (Summer 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Power of Myth |url=https://www.facinghistory.org/campus/reslib.nsf/99ca830bb4f483948525717f005abfc7/2820f36c177cc758852571860065e8c2/$FILE/complete_antisemitism.pdf |website=Facing History |access-date=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305002701/http://www2.facinghistory.org/Campus/reslib.nsf/99ca830bb4f483948525717f005abfc7/2820f36c177cc758852571860065e8c2/%24FILE/complete_antisemitism.pdf |archive-date=5 March 2009 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bauer"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bauer |first1=Yehuda |title=Problems of Contemporary Antisemitism |url=http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf |access-date=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307094003/http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf |archive-date=7 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bauer2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bauer |first=Yehuda |title=A History of the Holocaust |publisher=Franklin Watts |year=1982 |page=52 |isbn=0-531-05641-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Emil Fackenheim]] supported the unhyphenated spelling, in order to "[dispel] the notion that there is an entity 'Semitism' which 'anti-Semitism' opposes."&lt;ref name=Fackenheim&gt;{{harvp|Prager|Telushkin|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VK0llzUqQ2YC&amp;pg=PA199 199]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others endorsing an unhyphenated term for the same reason include Padraic O'Hare, professor of Religious and Theological Studies and Director of the Center for the Study of Jewish-Christian-Muslim Relations at [[Merrimack College]]; [[Yehuda Bauer]], professor of [[Holocaust studies]] at the Avraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]; and [[James Carroll (author)|James Carroll]], historian and novelist. According to Carroll, who first cites O'Hare and Bauer on "the existence of something called 'Semitism'", "the hyphenated word thus reflects the bipolarity that is at the heart of the problem of antisemitism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=James |author-link=James Carroll (author) |title=Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews |publisher=Mariner |location=New York |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n7EUdvSQs70C&amp;pg=PT421 |isbn=978-0618219087 |pages=628–629 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objections to the usage of the term, such as the obsolete nature of the term Semitic as a racial term, have been raised since at least the 1930s.&lt;ref name="MZ1987"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zimmermann |first=Moshe |title=Wilhelm Marr: The Patriarch of Anti-Semitism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYW013SjKM4C&amp;pg=PA112 |year=1987 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-536495-8 |page=112 |access-date=27 October 2018 |quote=The term "anti-Semitism" was unsuitable from the beginning for the real essence of Jew-hatred, which remained anchored, more or less, in the Christian tradition even when it moved via the natural sciences, into racism. It is doubtful whether the term which was first publicizes in an institutional context (the Anti-Semitic League) would have appeared at all if the "Anti-Chancellor League," which fought Bismarck's policy, had not been in existence since 1875. The founders of the new Organization adopted the elements of "anti" and "league," and searched for the proper term: Marr exchanged the term "Jew" for "Semite" which he already favored. It is possible that the shortened form "Sem" is used with such frequency and ease by Marr (and in his writings) due to its literary advantage and because it reminded Marr of Sem Biedermann, his Jewish employer from the Vienna period.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sevenster1975"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sevenster |first=Jan Nicolaas |title=The Roots of Pagan Anti-Semitism in the Ancient World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLE3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |access-date=27 October 2018 |year=1975 |publisher=Brill Archive |isbn=978-90-04-04193-6 |pages=1–2 |quote=It has long been realised that there are objections to the term anti-Semitism and therefore an endeavour has been made to find a word which better interprets the meaning intended.

It certainly expresses better than anti-Semitism the fact that it concerns the attitude to the Jews and avoids any suggestion of racial distinction, which was not or hardly, a factor of any significance in ancient times. For this reason Leipoldt preferred to speak of anti-Judaism when writing his ''Antisemitsmus in der alien Welt'' (l933). Bonsirven also preferred this word to Anti-Semitism, "mot moderne qui implique une théorie des races".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition===
Though the general definition of antisemitism is hostility or prejudice against Jews, and, according to [[Olaf Blaschke]], has become an "umbrella term for negative stereotypes about Jews",&lt;ref name="pogromsriots"&gt;{{cite book |first=Sonja |last=Weinberg |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0HDeEPouQm0C&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Pogroms and Riots: German Press Responses to Anti-Jewish Violence in Germany and Russia (1881–1882) |publisher=Peter Lang |year=2010 |access-date=27 October 2018 |isbn=9783631602140}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}} a number of authorities have developed more formal definitions.

Holocaust scholar and [[City University of New York]] professor [[Helen Fein]] defines it as "a persisting latent structure of hostile beliefs towards Jews as a collective manifested in individuals as attitudes, and in culture as myth, ideology, folklore and imagery, and in actions—social or legal discrimination, political mobilization against the Jews, and collective or state violence—which results in and/or is designed to distance, displace, or destroy Jews as Jews."

Elaborating on Fein's definition, Dietz Bering of the [[University of Cologne]] writes that, to antisemites, "Jews are not only partially but totally bad by nature, that is, their bad traits are incorrigible. Because of this bad nature: (1) Jews have to be seen not as individuals but as a collective. (2) Jews remain essentially alien in the surrounding societies. (3) Jews bring disaster on their 'host societies' or on the whole world, they are doing it secretly, therefore the anti-Semites feel obliged to unmask the conspiratorial, bad Jewish character."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Falk|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zL_0WOiZj0oC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Sonja Weinberg, as distinct from economic and religious [[anti-Judaism]], antisemitism in its modern form shows conceptual innovation, a resort to 'science' to defend itself, new functional forms and organisational differences. It was anti-liberal, racialist and nationalist. It promoted the myth that [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Jews conspired to 'judaise' the world]]; it served to consolidate social identity; it channeled dissatisfactions among victims of the capitalist system; and it was used as a conservative cultural code to fight emancipation and liberalism.&lt;ref name="pogromsriots" /&gt;{{rp|18–19}}

[[File:Antisemiticroths.jpg|thumb|Caricature by C.Léandre (France, 1898) showing [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] with the world in his hands]]
[[Bernard Lewis]] defines antisemitism as a special case of prejudice, hatred, or persecution directed against people who are in some way different from the rest. According to Lewis, antisemitism is marked by two distinct features: Jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others, and they are accused of "cosmic evil." Thus, "it is perfectly possible to hate and even to persecute Jews without necessarily being anti-Semitic" unless this hatred or persecution displays one of the two features specific to antisemitism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]]. [http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/21832.html "The New Anti-Semitism"], ''The American Scholar'', Volume 75 No. 1, Winter 2006, pp. 25–36. The paper is based on a lecture delivered at [[Brandeis University]] on 24 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of efforts by international and governmental bodies to define antisemitism formally. The [[United States Department of State]] states that "while there is no universally accepted definition, there is a generally clear understanding of what the term encompasses." For the purposes of its 2005 Report on Global Anti-Semitism, the term was considered to mean "hatred toward Jews—individually and as a group—that can be attributed to the Jewish religion and/or ethnicity."&lt;ref name=USDS&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/40258.htm "Report on Global Anti-Semitism"], [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], 5 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and [[Xenophobia]] (now [[Fundamental Rights Agency]]), then an agency of the [[European Union]], developed a more detailed [[EUMC Working Definition of Antisemitism|working definition]], which states: "Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities." It also adds that "such manifestations could also target the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity," but that "criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic." It provides contemporary examples of ways in which antisemitism may manifest itself, including: promoting the harming of Jews in the name of an ideology or religion; promoting negative stereotypes of Jews; holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of an individual Jewish person or group; [[Holocaust denial|denying the Holocaust]] or accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating it; and accusing Jews of [[dual loyalty]] or a greater allegiance to Israel than their own country. It also lists ways in which attacking Israel could be antisemitic, and states that denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor, can be a manifestation of antisemitism—as can applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation, or holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the State of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1879, [[Wilhelm Marr]] founded the ''Antisemiten-Liga'' (Anti-Semitic League).&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Levy, "Marr, Wilhelm (1819–1904)" in {{harvp|Levy|2005|loc=vol. 2, pp. 445–446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identification with antisemitism and as an antisemite was politically advantageous in Europe during the late 19th century. For example, [[Karl Lueger]], the popular mayor of [[fin de siècle]] [[Vienna]], skillfully exploited antisemitism as a way of channeling public discontent to his political advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Geehr. ''Karl Lueger, Mayor of Fin-de-Siècle Vienna'', Wayne State University Press, Detroit, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8143-2055-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 1910 obituary of Lueger, ''The New York Times'' notes that Lueger was "Chairman of the Christian Social Union of the Parliament and of the Anti-Semitic Union of the Diet of Lower Austria.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1910/03/11/archives/dr-karl-lueger-dead-antisemitic-leader-and-mayor-of-vienna-was-66.html Dr. Karl Lueger Dead; Anti-Semitic Leader and Mayor of Vienna Was 66 Years Old.] ''The New York Times'', 11 March 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895 [[A. C. Cuza]] organized the ''Alliance Anti-semitique Universelle'' in Bucharest. In the period before [[World War II]], when animosity towards Jews was far more commonplace, it was not uncommon for a person, an organization, or a political party to self-identify as an antisemite or antisemitic.

The early [[Zionism|Zionist]] pioneer [[Leon Pinsker]], a professional physician, preferred the clinical-sounding term ''Judeophobia'' to antisemitism, which he regarded as a misnomer. The word ''Judeophobia'' first appeared in his pamphlet "[[Auto-Emancipation]]", published anonymously in German in September 1882, where it was described as an irrational fear or hatred of Jews. According to Pinsker, this irrational fear was an inherited predisposition.&lt;ref name="Bartlett2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Steven J.|title=The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5KQ0Yi76GMC&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=2 June 2015|year=2005|publisher=Charles C Thomas Publisher|isbn=9780398075576|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Judeophobia is a form of demonopathy, with the distinction that the Jewish ghost has become known to the whole race of mankind, not merely to certain races....

In the aftermath of the [[Kristallnacht]] pogrom in 1938, German propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] announced: "The German people is anti-Semitic. It has no desire to have its rights restricted or to be provoked in the future by parasites of the Jewish race."&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Telegraph'', 12 November 1938.

After the 1945 [[End of World War II in Europe|victory of the Allies over Nazi Germany]], and particularly after the full extent of the [[The Holocaust|Nazi genocide against the Jews]] became known, the term "anti-Semitism" acquired [[pejorative]] connotations. This marked a full circle shift in usage, from an era just decades earlier when "Jew" was used as a pejorative term.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Rader Marcus. ''United States Jewry, 1776–1985.''

==Manifestations==
[[File:Medieval manuscript-Jews identified by rouelle are being burned at stake.jpg|thumb|Jews (identified by the mandatory [[Jewish badge]] and [[Jewish hat]]) being burned.]]
Antisemitism manifests itself in a variety of ways. [[René König]] mentions social antisemitism, economic antisemitism, religious antisemitism, and political antisemitism as examples. König points out that these different forms demonstrate that the "origins of anti-Semitic prejudices are rooted in different historical periods." König asserts that differences in the chronology of different antisemitic prejudices and the irregular distribution of such prejudices over different segments of the population create "serious difficulties in the definition of the different kinds of anti-Semitism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Materialien zur Kriminalsoziologie |first=René |last= König |publisher=VS Verlag |year=2004 |page=231 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=N9oL2cljv8QC&amp;pg=PA231|isbn=978-3-8100-3306-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These difficulties may contribute to the existence of different taxonomies that have been developed to categorize the forms of antisemitism. The forms identified are substantially the same; it is primarily the number of forms and their definitions that differ. [[Bernard Lazare]] identifies three forms of antisemitism: [[Christianity and antisemitism|Christian antisemitism]], economic antisemitism, and ethnologic antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anti-Semitism: Its History and Causes |first=Bernard |last=Lazare |publisher=Cosimo, Inc. |year=2006 |page=224|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VP81v2Y24HUC&amp;pg=PA224|isbn=978-1-59605-601-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*political and economic antisemitism, giving as examples [[Cicero]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles Lindbergh]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Religious antisemitism|theological or religious antisemitism]], sometimes known as [[anti-Judaism]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*nationalistic antisemitism, citing [[Voltaire]] and other [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers, who attacked Jews for supposedly having certain characteristics, such as greed and arrogance, and for observing customs such as [[kashrut]] and [[Shabbat]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*and [[racial antisemitism]], with its extreme form resulting in [[the Holocaust]] by the [[Nazi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Harap separates "economic antisemitism" and merges "political" and "nationalistic" antisemitism into "ideological antisemitism". Harap also adds a category of "social antisemitism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Creative awakening: the Jewish presence in twentieth-century American literature, 1900-1940s |first=Louis |last=Harap |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1987 |page=24|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mAPvam-n_DYC&amp;pg=PA24|isbn=978-0-313-25386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* religious (Jew as Christ-killer),
* economic (Jew as banker, usurer, money-obsessed),
* social (Jew as social inferior, "pushy," vulgar, therefore excluded from personal contact),
* racist (Jews as an inferior "race"),
* ideological (Jews regarded as subversive or revolutionary),
* cultural (Jews regarded as undermining the moral and structural fiber of civilization).

[[Gustavo Perednik]] has argued that what he terms "Judeophobia" has a number of unique traits which set it apart from other forms of racism, including permanence, depth, obsessiveness, irrationality, endurance, ubiquity, and danger.&lt;ref&gt;Gustavo Perednik, [http://www.zionism-israel.com/his/judeophobia.htm Judeophobia –  Anti-Semitism, Jew-Hate and anti-"Zionism"]&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote in his book ''The Judeophobia'' that "The Jews were accused by the nationalists of being the creators of Communism; by the Communists of ruling Capitalism. If they live in non-Jewish countries, they are accused of double-loyalties; if they live in the Jewish country, of being racists. When they spend their money, they are reproached for being ostentatious; when they don't spend their money, of being avaricious. They are called rootless cosmopolitans or hardened chauvinists. If they assimilate, they are accused of being fifth-columnists, if they don't, of shutting themselves away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perednik |first=Gustavo |title=La Judeofobia: Cómo y Cuándo Nace, Dónde y Por Qué Pervive |url=https://books.google.com/?id=c3IiAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Los+judíos+fueron+acusados+por+los+nacionalistas+de+ser+generadores+del+comunismo;+por+los+comunistas+de+regir+el+capitalismo.+Si+viven+en+países+no+judíos,+son+acusados+de+dobles+lealtades;+si+viven+en+el+país+judío,+de+ser+racistas.+Cuando+gastan+su+dinero,+se+les+reprocha+ser+ostentosos;+cuando+no+lo+gastan,+ser+avaros.+Son+tildados+de+cosmopolitas+sin+raíces+o+de+chauvinistas+empedernidos.+Si+se+asimilan+al+medio,+se+les+acusa+de+quintacolumnistas,+si+no,+de+recluirse+en+sí+mismos.&amp;dq=Los+judíos+fueron+acusados+por+los+nacionalistas+de+ser+generadores+del+comunismo;+por+los+comunistas+de+regir+el+capitalismo.+Si+viven+en+países+no+judíos,+son+acusados+de+dobles+lealtades;+si+viven+en+el+país+judío,+de+ser+racistas.+Cuando+gastan+su+dinero,+se+les+reprocha+ser+ostentosos;+cuando+no+lo+gastan,+ser+avaros.+Son+tildados+de+cosmopolitas+sin+raíces+o+de+chauvinistas+empedernidos.+Si+se+asimilan+al+medio,+se+les+acusa+de+quintacolumnistas,+si+no,+de+recluirse+en+sí+mismos.|publisher=Flor del Viento |year=2001 |page=26 |isbn=978-8489644588 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perednik |first=Gustavo Daniel |title=España descarrilada: terror islamista en Madrid y el despertar de Occidente |publisher=Inédita Editores |year=2004 |isbn=978-8496364042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard University|Harvard]] professor [[Ruth Wisse]] has argued that antisemitism is a political ideology that authoritarians use to consolidate power by unifying disparate groups. One example she gives is the [[Criticism of the United Nations#Allegations of anti-Zionism and antisemitism|alleged antisemitism within the United Nations]], which, in this view, functioned during the [[Cold War]] as a coalition-building technique between Soviet and Arab states, but now serves the same purpose among states opposed to the type of human-rights ideology for which the UN was created. She also cites as an example the formation of the [[Arab League]].&lt;ref name="Wisse" /&gt;

===Cultural antisemitism===

Louis Harap defines cultural antisemitism as "that species of anti-Semitism that charges the Jews with corrupting a given culture and attempting to supplant or succeeding in supplanting the preferred culture with a uniform, crude, "Jewish" culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Creative awakening: the Jewish presence in twentieth-century American literature |first=Louis |last=Harap |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1987 |page=76 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mAPvam-n_DYC&amp;pg=PA76 |isbn=978-0-313-25386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Eric Kandel]] characterizes cultural antisemitism as being based on the idea of "Jewishness" as a "religious or cultural tradition that is acquired through learning, through distinctive traditions and education." According to Kandel, this form of antisemitism views Jews as possessing "unattractive psychological and social characteristics that are acquired through acculturation."&lt;ref name=Kandel30&gt;{{cite book |title=In search of memory: the emergence of a new science of mind |first=Eric R. |last=Kandel |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |year=2007 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PFnRwWXzypgC&amp;pg=PA30 |isbn=978-0-393-32937-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niewyk and Nicosia characterize cultural antisemitism as focusing on and condemning "the Jews' aloofness from the societies in which they live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust |first1=Donald L. |last1=Niewyk|first2=Francis R. |last2=Nicosia |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2003|page=215|url=https://books.google.com/?id=z-6vKBHggVwC&amp;pg=PA215|isbn=978-0-231-11201-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An important feature of cultural antisemitism is that it considers the negative attributes of Judaism to be redeemable by education or by religious conversion.&lt;ref name=Kandel3031&gt;{{cite book |title=In search of memory: the emergence of a new science of mind |first=Eric R. |last=Kandel |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |year=2007 |pages=30–31 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PFnRwWXzypgC&amp;pg=PA30|isbn=978-0-393-32937-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious antisemitism===
{{See also|Anti-Judaism|Christianity and antisemitism|Islam and antisemitism}}
[[File:Execution of Mariana de Carabajal.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Execution of [[Francisca Nuñez de Carabajal|Mariana de Carabajal]] (converted Jew), accused of a relapse into Judaism, [[Mexico City]], 1601]]
[[Religious antisemitism]], also known as anti-Judaism, is antipathy towards Jews because of their perceived religious beliefs. In theory, antisemitism and attacks against individual Jews would stop if Jews stopped practicing Judaism or changed their public faith, especially by [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to the official or right religion. However, in some cases discrimination continues after conversion, as in the case of Christianized ''[[Marranos]]'' or Iberian Jews in the late 15th century and 16th century who were suspected of secretly practising Judaism or Jewish customs.&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt;

Although the origins of antisemitism are rooted in the Judeo-Christian conflict, other forms of antisemitism have developed in modern times. Frederick Schweitzer asserts that, "most scholars ignore the Christian foundation on which the modern antisemitic edifice rests and invoke political antisemitism, cultural antisemitism, racism or racial antisemitism, economic antisemitism and the like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A concise history of American antisemitism |first=Robert |last=Michael |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2005|page=vii |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5G3feplFBYUC&amp;pg=PR7|isbn=978-0-7425-4313-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Nichols draws a distinction between religious antisemitism and modern antisemitism based on racial or ethnic grounds: "The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion [...] a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon [[baptism]]." From the perspective of racial antisemitism, however, "the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism.[...] From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews[...] Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear."

Some Christians such as the Catholic priest [[Ernest Jouin]], who published the first French translation of the ''Protocols'', combined religious and racial anti-Semitism, as in his statement that "From the triple viewpoint of race, of nationality, and of religion, the Jew has become the enemy of humanity."&lt;ref name="Michael"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=R. |title=A History of Catholic Antisemitism: The Dark Side of the Church |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; The virulent anti-Semitism of [[Édouard Drumont]], one of the most widely read Catholic writers in France during the Dreyfus Affair, likewise combined religious and racial anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arnal |first1=Oscar L. |title=Ambivalent Alliance: The Catholic Church and the Action Française, 1899-1939 |date=1985 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rubenstein |first1=Richard L. |title=Approaches to Auschwitz: The Holocaust and Its Legacy |date=2003 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brustein |first1=William |title=Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe Before the Holocaust |date=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic antisemitism===
The underlying premise of [[economic antisemitism]] is that Jews perform harmful economic activities or that economic activities become harmful when they are performed by Jews.&lt;ref name=MeyerBrenner220&gt;{{cite book |title=German-Jewish History in Modern Times: Integration in dispute, 1871–1918 |publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1998 |page=220 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HFFoSglsovoC&amp;pg=PA220|isbn=978-0-231-07476-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linking Jews and money underpins the most damaging and lasting [[Antisemitic canard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jews &amp; Money – The story of a stereotype|url=http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/jewsandmoney/default.asp|accessdate=18 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228220753/http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/jewsandmoney/default.asp|archivedate=28 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemites claim that Jews control the world finances, a theory promoted in the fraudulent [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]], and later repeated by [[Henry Ford]] and his [[The Dearborn Independent|Dearborn Independent]]. In the modern era, such myths continue to be spread in books such as ''[[The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews]]'' published by the [[Nation of Islam]], and on the internet.
[[Derek Penslar]] writes that there are two components to the financial [[Antisemitic canard|canards]]:&lt;ref&gt;Penslar, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
:a) Jews are savages that "are temperamentally incapable of performing honest labor"
:b) Jews are "leaders of a financial cabal seeking world domination"

[[Abraham Foxman]] describes six facets of the financial canards:
#All Jews are wealthy&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jews are stingy and greedy&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;
#Powerful Jews control the business world&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jewish religion emphasizes profit and materialism&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;
#It is okay for Jews to cheat non-Jews&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jews use their power to benefit "their own kind"&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerald Krefetz]] summarizes the myth as "[Jews] control the banks, the money supply, the economy, and businesses—of the community, of the country, of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Krefetz gives, as illustrations, many slurs and proverbs (in several different languages) which suggest that Jews are stingy, or greedy, or miserly, or aggressive bargainers.&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; During the nineteenth century, Jews were described as "scurrilous, stupid, and tight-fisted", but after the [[Jewish Emancipation]] and the rise of Jews to the middle- or upper-class in Europe were portrayed as "clever, devious, and manipulative financiers out to dominate [world finances]".&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Léon Poliakov]] asserts that economic antisemitism is not a distinct form of antisemitism, but merely a manifestation of theologic antisemitism (because, without the theological causes of the economic antisemitism, there would be no economic antisemitism). In opposition to this view, Derek Penslar contends that in the modern era, the economic antisemitism is "distinct and nearly constant" but theological antisemitism is "often subdued".&lt;ref&gt;Penslar, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

An academic study by Francesco D'Acunto, Marcel Prokopczuk, and Michael Weber showed that people who live in areas of Germany that contain the most brutal history of anti-Semitic persecution are more likely to be distrustful of finance in general. Therefore, they tended to invest less money in the stock market and make poor financial decisions. The study concluded "that the persecution of minorities reduces not only the long-term wealth of the persecuted, but of the persecutors as well."&lt;ref&gt;D’Acunto, Francesco, et al.

===Racial antisemitism===

Racial antisemitism is prejudice against [[Jew]]s as a racial/ethnic group, rather than [[Judaism]] as a religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1603&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Anti-semitism "Anti-Semitism"], [[Jewish Encyclopedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial antisemitism is the idea that the Jews are a distinct and inferior race compared to their host nations. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, it gained mainstream acceptance as part of the [[eugenics]] movement, which categorized non-Europeans as inferior. It more specifically claimed that Northern Europeans, or "Aryans", were superior. Racial antisemites saw the Jews as part of a Semitic race and emphasized their non-European origins and culture. They saw Jews as beyond redemption even if they converted to the majority religion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Racial antisemitism replaced the hatred of Judaism with the hatred of Jews as a group. In the context of the [[Industrial Revolution]], following the [[Jewish Emancipation]], Jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility. With the decreasing role of religion in public life tempering religious antisemitism, a combination of growing [[nationalism]], the rise of [[eugenics]], and resentment at the socio-economic success of the Jews led to the newer, and more virulent, racist antisemitism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

According to William Nichols, religious antisemitism may be distinguished from modern antisemitism based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[ethnicity|ethnic]] grounds. "The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion... a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism." However, with racial antisemitism, "Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism.... From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews... Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear."&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, William: ''Christian Antisemitism, A History of Hate'' (1993) p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, a number of laws enabling emancipation of the Jews were enacted in Western European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Webster (2001)''Petain's Crime''. London, Pan Books: 13, 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism''.

Despite this, traditional discrimination and hostility to Jews on religious grounds persisted and was supplemented by [[racial antisemitism]], encouraged by the work of racial theorists such as [[Joseph Arthur de Gobineau]] and particularly his ''Essay on the Inequality of the Human Race'' of 1853–5. [[Nationalist]] agendas based on [[ethnicity]], known as [[ethnonationalism]], usually excluded the Jews from the national community as an alien race.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Beller (2007)''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': 64&lt;/ref&gt; Allied to this were theories of [[Social Darwinism]], which stressed a putative conflict between higher and lower races of human beings.

[[William I. Brustein|William Brustein]] defines political antisemitism as hostility toward Jews based on the belief that Jews seek national and/or world power." Yisrael Gutman characterizes political antisemitism as tending to "lay responsibility on the Jews for defeats and political economic crises" while seeking to "exploit opposition and resistance to Jewish influence as elements in political party platforms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Genocide, critical issues of the Holocaust: a companion to the film, Genocide |publisher=Behrman House, Inc |year=1983 |page=100 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DcdiVs9lwvcC&amp;pg=PA100|isbn=978-0-940646-04-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|New antisemitism}}
Starting in the 1990s, some scholars have advanced the concept of [[new antisemitism]], coming simultaneously from the [[Left-wing politics|left]], the [[Right-wing politics|right]], and [[Islamism|radical Islam]], which tends to focus on opposition to the creation of a Jewish homeland in the [[State of Israel]],&lt;ref name="New-AS-List"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and they argue that the language of [[anti-Zionism]] and [[criticism of Israel]] are used to attack Jews more broadly. In this view, the proponents of the new concept believe that [[criticism of Israel|criticisms of Israel]] and [[Zionism]] are often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind, and they attribute this to antisemitism. Jewish scholar [[Gustavo Perednik]] posited in 2004 that anti-Zionism in itself represents a form of discrimination against Jews, in that it singles out Jewish national aspirations as an illegitimate and racist endeavor, and "proposes actions that would result in the death of millions of Jews".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031205153139/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=2791 "Antiglobalism's Jewish Problem"] in Rosenbaum, Ron (ed). ''Those who forget the past: The Question of Anti-Semitism'', Random House 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;272.&lt;/ref&gt; It is asserted that the new antisemitism deploys traditional antisemitic motifs, including older motifs such as the [[blood libel]].&lt;ref name="New-AS-List"/&gt;

Critics of the concept view it as trivializing the meaning of antisemitism, and as exploiting antisemitism in order to silence debate and to deflect attention from legitimate [[criticism of Israel|criticism of the State of Israel]], and, by associating anti-Zionism with antisemitism, misused to taint anyone opposed to Israeli actions and policies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Klug|Klug, Brian]].

Many authors see the roots of modern antisemitism in both pagan antiquity and early Christianity. Jerome Chanes identifies six stages in the historical development of antisemitism:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chanes|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Pre-Christian anti-Judaism in ancient Greece and Rome which was primarily ethnic in nature
#Christian antisemitism in antiquity and the Middle Ages which was religious in nature and has extended into modern times
#Traditional Muslim antisemitism which was—at least, in its classical form—nuanced in that Jews were a protected class
#Political, social and economic antisemitism of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment Europe which laid the groundwork for racial antisemitism
#Racial antisemitism that arose in the 19th century and culminated in Nazism in the 20th century
#Contemporary antisemitism which has been labeled by some as the [[New Antisemitism]]

Chanes suggests that these six stages could be merged into three categories: "ancient antisemitism, which was primarily ethnic in nature; [[Christian antisemitism]], which was religious; and the racial antisemitism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;ref name=Chanes5&gt;{{harvp|Chanes|2004|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient world===

The first clear examples of anti-Jewish sentiment can be traced to the 3rd century BCE to [[Alexandria]],&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt; the home to the largest Jewish diaspora community in the world at the time and where the [[Septuagint]], a Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]], was produced. [[Manetho]], an Egyptian priest and historian of that era, wrote scathingly of the Jews. His themes are repeated in the works of [[Chaeremon of Alexandria|Chaeremon]], [[Lysimachus]], [[Poseidonius]], [[Apollonius Molon]], and in [[Apion]] and [[Tacitus]].&lt;ref name=Flannery&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agatharchides of Cnidus]] ridiculed the practices of the Jews and the "absurdity of [[Torah|their Law]]", making a mocking reference to how [[Ptolemy Lagus]] was able to invade [[Jerusalem]] in 320 BCE because its inhabitants were observing the ''[[Shabbat]]''.&lt;ref name=Flannery /&gt; One of the earliest anti-Jewish [[edict]]s, promulgated by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] in about 170–167 BCE, sparked a revolt of the [[Maccabees]] in [[Judea]].&lt;ref name="gruen"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |authorlink=Erich S.

In view of Manetho's anti-Jewish writings, antisemitism may have originated in Egypt and been spread by "the [[Greeks|Greek]] retelling of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian prejudices".&lt;ref name="Schäfer"&gt;Schäfer, Peter. ''Judeophobia'', Harvard University Press, 1997, p. 208.[[Peter Schaefer (author)|Peter Schäfer]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Jewish philosopher [[Philo of Alexandria]] describes an attack on Jews in Alexandria in 38 CE in which thousands of Jews died.&lt;ref name=Barclay&gt;Barclay, John M G, 1999.

''Philo's Flaccus: the First Pogrom'', Philo of Alexandria Commentary Series, Brill. [[Pieter Willem van der Horst]]&lt;/ref&gt; Tcherikover argues that the reason for hatred of Jews in the Hellenistic period was their separateness in the Greek cities, the ''[[polis|poleis]]''.&lt;ref name=tcherikover&gt;Tcherikover, Victor, ''Hellenistic Civilization and the Jews'', New York: Atheneum, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Bohak has argued, however, that early animosity against the Jews cannot be regarded as being anti-Judaic or antisemitic unless it arose from attitudes that were held against the Jews alone, and that many Greeks showed animosity toward any group they regarded as barbarians.&lt;ref name=Bohak&gt;Bohak, Gideon. "The Ibis and the Jewish Question: Ancient 'Antisemitism' in Historical Context" in Menachem Mor et al., ''Jews and Gentiles in the Holy Land in the Days of the Second Temple, the Mishna and the Talmud'', Yad Ben-Zvi Press, 2003, pp. 27–43 {{ISBN|9652172057}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Statements exhibiting prejudice against Jews and their religion can be found in the works of many [[pagan]] [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3265911|author=Daniels J.L.|title=Anti-Semitism in the Hellenistic-Roman Period|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature|volume=98 |issue=1|year=1979|pages=45–65|doi=10.2307/3265911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Flannery writes that it was the Jews' refusal to accept Greek religious and social standards that marked them out. Hecataetus of Abdera, a Greek historian of the early third century BCE, wrote that Moses "in remembrance of the exile of his people, instituted for them a misanthropic and inhospitable way of life." [[Manetho]], an Egyptian historian, wrote that the Jews were expelled Egyptian [[Leprosy|lepers]] who had been taught by [[Moses]] "not to adore the gods." Edward Flannery describes antisemitism in ancient times as essentially "cultural, taking the shape of a national xenophobia played out in political settings."&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt;

There are examples of [[Hellenistic]] rulers desecrating the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] and banning Jewish religious practices, such as [[circumcision]], Shabbat observance, study of Jewish religious books, etc. Examples may also be found in anti-Jewish riots in [[Alexandria]] in the 3rd century BCE.

The Jewish diaspora on the [[Nile River|Nile]] island [[Elephantine]], which was founded by mercenaries, experienced the destruction of its temple in 410 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Colpe, Carsten (Berlin). "Anti-Semitism." Brill's New Pauly. Antiquity volumes edited by: Hubert Cancik and Helmuth Schneider. Brill, 2008. Brill Online. 28 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Relationships between the Jewish people and the occupying [[Roman Empire]] were at times antagonistic and resulted in [[Jewish-Roman wars|several rebellions]]. According to [[Suetonius]], the emperor [[Tiberius]] expelled from Rome Jews who had gone to live there. The 18th-century English historian [[Edward Gibbon]] identified a more tolerant period in Roman-Jewish relations beginning in about 160 CE.&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt; However, when Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire, the state's attitude towards the Jews [[History of antisemitism#Late Roman Empire|gradually worsened]].

[[James Carroll (novelist)|James Carroll]] asserted: "Jews accounted for 10% of the total population of the [[Roman Empire]]. By that ratio, if other factors such as [[pogrom]]s and [[forced conversion|conversion]]s had not intervened, there would be 200 million Jews in the world today, instead of something like 13 million."&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, James.

During the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe there was persecution against Jews in many places, with [[blood libel]]s, expulsions, [[forced conversion]]s and [[massacre]]s. A main justification of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious.

During the mid-to-late 17th century the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was devastated by several conflicts, in which the Commonwealth lost over a third of its population (over 3 million people), and Jewish losses were counted in the hundreds of thousands.

The precise number of dead may never be known, but the decrease of the Jewish population during that period is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000, which also includes emigration, deaths from diseases and [[Slavery (Ottoman Empire)|captivity in the Ottoman Empire]], called ''jasyr''.&lt;ref&gt;"Bogdan Chmelnitzki leads Cossack uprising against Polish rule; 100,000 Jews are killed and hundreds of Jewish communities are destroyed."

European immigrants to the United States brought antisemitism to the country as early as the 17th century. [[Peter Stuyvesant]], the Dutch governor of [[New Amsterdam]], implemented plans to prevent Jews from settling in the city. During the Colonial Era, the American government limited the political and economic rights of Jews. It was not until the [[American Revolutionary War]] that Jews gained legal rights, including the right to vote. However, even at their peak, the restrictions on Jews in the United States were never as stringent as they had been in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|first=Ed. by Paul S.|title=The Oxford companion to United States history|year=2006|publisher=Oxford Univ.

In the [[Zaydi|Zaydi imamate]] of [[Yemen]], Jews were also singled out for discrimination in the 17th century, which culminated in the general expulsion of all Jews from places in Yemen to the arid coastal plain of [[Tihamah]] and which became known as the [[Mawza Exile]].&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim'' (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem 1989, pp. 714–716 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlightenment===
In 1744, [[Frederick II of Prussia]] limited the number of Jews allowed to live in [[Breslau]] to only ten so-called "protected" Jewish families and encouraged a similar practice in other [[Prussia]]n cities. In 1750 he issued the ''Revidiertes General Privilegium und Reglement vor die Judenschaft'': the "protected" Jews had an alternative to "either abstain from marriage or leave [[Berlin]]" (quoting [[Simon Dubnow]]). In the same year, Archduchess of Austria [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] ordered Jews out of [[Bohemia]] but soon reversed her position, on the condition that Jews pay for their readmission every ten years. This [[extortion]] was known as ''malke-geld'' (queen's money). In 1752 she introduced the law limiting each Jewish family to one son. In 1782, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] abolished most of these persecution practices in his ''[[Toleranzpatent]]'', on the condition that [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] were eliminated from public records and that judicial autonomy was annulled. [[Moses Mendelssohn]] wrote that "Such a tolerance... is even more dangerous play in tolerance than open persecution."

===Voltaire===
According to Arnold Ages, [[Voltaire]]'s "Lettres philosophiques, Dictionnaire philosophique, and Candide, to name but a few of his better known works, are saturated with comments on Jews and Judaism and the vast majority are negative".&lt;ref&gt;Ages Arnold. "Tainted Greatness: The Case of Voltaire's Anti-Semitism: The Testimony of the Correspondence." Neohelicon 21.2 (Sept. 1994): 361.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul H. Meyer adds: "There is no question but that Voltaire, particularly in his latter years, nursed a violent hatred of the Jews and it is equally certain that his animosity...did have a considerable impact on public opinion in France."&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Paul H. "The Attitude of the Enlightenment Toward the Jew." Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century, 26 (1963): 1177.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty of the 118 articles in Voltaire's ''[[Dictionnaire Philosophique]]'' concerned Jews and described them in consistently negative ways.&lt;ref&gt;[[Léon Poliakov|Poliakov, L.]] ''The History of Anti-Semitism: From Voltaire to Wagner''.

===Louis de Bonald and the Catholic Counter-Revolution===
The [[counter-revolutionary]] Catholic royalist [[Louis de Bonald]] stands out among the earliest figures to explicitly call for the reversal of Jewish emancipation in the wake of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Battini1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Socialism of Fools: Capitalism and Modern Anti-Semitism|last=Battini|first=Michele|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=2–7 and 30–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Katz |first1=Jacob |title=From Prejudice to Destruction: Anti-Semitism, 1700-1933 |date=1980 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=112–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonald's attacks on the Jews are likely to have influenced [[Napoléon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]'s decision to limit the civil rights of Alsatian Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Socialism of Fools: Capitalism and Modern Anti-Semitism|last=Battini|first=Michele|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garṭner |first1=Aryeh |last2=Gartner |first2=Lloyd P. |title=History of the Jews in Modern Times |date=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Joskowicz |first1=Ari |title=The Modernity of Others: Jewish Anti-Catholicism in Germany and France |date=2013 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=Robert |last2=Rosen |first2=Philip |title=Dictionary of Antisemitism from the Earliest Times to the Present |date=2007 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonald's article ''Sur les juifs'' (1806) was one of the most venomous screeds of its era and furnished a paradigm which combined anti-liberalism, a defense of a rural society, traditional Christian antisemitism, and the identification of Jews with bankers and finance capital, which would in turn influence many subsequent right-wing reactionaries such as [[Roger Gougenot des Mousseaux]], [[Charles Maurras]], and [[Édouard Drumont]], nationalists such as [[Maurice Barrès]] and [[Paolo Orano]], and anti-Semitic socialists such as [[Alphonse Toussenel]].&lt;ref name="Battini1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sanos |first1=Sandrine |title=The Aesthetics of Hate: Far-Right Intellectuals, Antisemitism, and Gender in 1930s France |date=2012 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laqueur |first1=Walter |last2=Baumel |first2=Judith Tydor |title=The Holocaust Encyclopedia |date=2001 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonald furthermore declared that the Jews were an "alien" people, a "state within a state", and should be forced to wear a distinctive mark to more easily identify and discriminate against them.&lt;ref name="Battini1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael1" /&gt;

Under the French Second Empire, the popular counter-revolutionary Catholic journalist [[Louis Veuillot]] propagated Bonald's arguments against the Jewish "financial aristocracy" along with vicious attacks against the Talmud and the Jews as a "deicidal people" driven by hatred to "enslave" Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graetz |first1=Michael |title=The Jews in Nineteenth-century France: From the French Revolution to the Alliance Israélite Universelle |date=1996 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=Robert |title=A History of Catholic Antisemitism: The Dark Side of the Church |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1882 and 1886 alone, French priests published twenty antisemitic books blaming France's ills on the Jews and urging the government to consign them back to the ghettos, expel them, or hang them from the gallows.&lt;ref name="Michael1" /&gt; Gougenot des Mousseaux's ''Le Juif, le judaïsme et la judaïsation des peuples chrétiens'' (1869) has been called a "Bible of modern antisemitism" and was translated into German by Nazi ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]].&lt;ref name="Michael1" /&gt;

===Imperial Russia===
Thousands of Jews were slaughtered by Cossack [[Haidamaka|Haidamaks]] in the 1768 [[massacre of Uman]] in the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]. In 1772, the empress of Russia [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] forced the Jews into the [[Pale of Settlement]] &amp;ndash; which was located primarily in present-day Poland, Ukraine and Belarus &amp;ndash; and to stay in their [[shtetls]] and forbade them from returning to the towns that they occupied before the [[partition of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Poland.html The Virtual Jewish History Tour By Rebecca Weiner].

Policy towards Jews was liberalised somewhat under [[Czar Alexander II]] ({{reign|1855|1881}}).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson, ''A History of the Jews'', Harper Perennial, 1986, p 359&lt;/ref&gt; However, his assassination in 1881 served as a pretext for further repression such as the [[May Laws]] of 1882. [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], nicknamed the "black czar" and tutor to the [[czarevitch]], later crowned [[Czar Nicholas II]], declared that "One third of the Jews must die, one third must emigrate, and one third be converted to Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Van der Kiste]],''The Romanovs 1818–1959'', Sutton, 1998, p 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic antisemitism in the 19th century===
Historian [[Martin Gilbert]] writes that it was in the 19th century that the position of Jews worsened in [[Muslim]] countries. [[Benny Morris]] writes that one symbol of Jewish degradation was the phenomenon of stone-throwing at Jews by Muslim children. Morris quotes a 19th-century traveler: "I have seen a little fellow of six years old, with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four, teaching [them] to throw stones at a Jew, and one little urchin would, with the greatest coolness, waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his Jewish [[gaberdine]]. To all this the Jew is obliged to submit; it would be more than his life was worth to offer to strike a Mahommedan."&lt;ref name=Morris10&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]]. ''Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881–2001''. Vintage Books, 2001, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 19th century, [[J. J. Benjamin]] wrote about the life of [[Persian Jews]], describing conditions and beliefs that went back to the 16th century: "…they are obliged to live in a separate part of town… Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt…."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bernard |last=Lewis |title=The Jews of Islam |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |year=1984 |pages=181–183|isbn=978-0-691-00807-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jerusalem at least, conditions for some Jews improved. [[Moses Montefiore]], on his seventh visit in 1875, noted that fine new buildings had sprung up and; 'surely we're approaching the time to witness God's hallowed promise unto Zion.' Muslim and Christian Arabs participated in [[Purim]] and [[Passover]]; Arabs called the [[Sephardi]]s 'Jews, sons of Arabs'; the [[Ulema]] and the Rabbis offered joint prayers for rain in time of drought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], ''Jerusalem'', Phoenix, 2011, pp. 429-432&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the Dreyfus trial in France, 'Muslim comments usually favoured the persecuted Jew against his Christian persecutors'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lewis]], ''What Went Wrong?'', Phoenix, 2002, p 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secular or racial antisemitism===
[[Image:Wagner Das Judenthum in der Musik 1869.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Title page of the second edition of ''Das Judenthum in der Musik'', published in 1869]]
In 1850 the German composer [[Richard Wagner]] – who has been called "the inventor of modern antisemitism"&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt; – published ''[[Das Judenthum in der Musik]]'' (roughly "Jewishness in Music"&lt;ref name=bismarck&gt;[[Jonathan Steinberg|Steinberg, Jonathan]] (2011) ''Bismarck: A Life'' New York: Oxford, pp.388–90. {{ISBN|978-0-19-997539-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;) under a [[pseudonym]] in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]''. The essay began as an attack on Jewish composers, particularly Wagner's contemporaries, and rivals, [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], but expanded to accuse Jews of being a harmful and alien element in [[Culture of Germany|German culture]], who corrupted morals and were, in fact, parasites incapable of creating truly "German" art. The crux was the manipulation and control by the Jews of the money economy:&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the present constitution of this world, the Jew in truth is already more than emancipated: he rules, and will rule, so long as Money remains the power before which all our doings and our dealings lose their force.&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although originally published anonymously, when the essay was republished 19 years later, in 1869, the concept of the corrupting Jew had become so widely held that Wagner's name was affixed to it.&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;
 
Antisemitism can also be found in many of the [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]] by [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]], published from 1812 to 1857. It is mainly characterized by Jews being the [[villain]] of a story, such as in "The Good Bargain" ("''Der gute Handel"'') and "The Jew Among Thorns" (''"Der Jude im Dorn"'').

The middle 19th century saw continued official harassment of the Jews, especially in Eastern Europe under Czarist influence. For example, in 1846, 80 Jews approached the governor in Warsaw to retain the right to wear their traditional dress, but were immediately rebuffed by having their hair and beards forcefully cut, at their own expense.&lt;ref name=BDE&gt;{{cite bklyn|title=The Despot of Russia...|image=50249029|date=22 December 1846|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, even such influential figures as Walt Whitman tolerated bigotry toward the Jews. During his time as editor of the Brooklyn Eagle (1846–1848), the newspaper published historical sketches casting Jews in a bad light.&lt;ref name=BDE-Whitman&gt;{{cite bklyn|title=Anecdotes of Jews, and their peculiar traits|image=50243090|page=2|date=8 January 1847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dreyfus Affair]] was an infamous antisemitic event of the late 19th century and early 20th century. [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish artillery [[wikt:captain|captain]] in the [[French Army]], was accused in 1894 of passing secrets to the Germans. As a result of these charges, Dreyfus was convicted and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] on [[Devil's Island]]. The actual spy, Marie Charles Esterhazy, was acquitted. The event caused great uproar among the French, with the public choosing sides on the issue of whether Dreyfus was actually guilty or not. [[Émile Zola]] accused the army of corrupting the French justice system. However, general consensus held that Dreyfus was guilty: 80% of the press in France condemned him. This attitude among the majority of the French population reveals the underlying antisemitism of the time period.&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, Michael. (2005) Nineteenth Century Europe. New York: Palgrave MacMillan {{ISBN|0333652460}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Stoecker]] (1835–1909), the [[Lutheran]] court chaplain to [[Kaiser Wilhelm I]], founded in 1878 an antisemitic, [[Liberalism|anti-liberal]] political party called the [[Christian Social Party (Germany)|Christian Social Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harold M.

Some scholars view [[Karl Marx|Karl Marx's]] essay ''[[On The Jewish Question]]'' as antisemitic, and argue that he often used antisemitic epithets in his published and private writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|2004|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobs2005"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Marx, Karl (1818–1883) |title=Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution |last=Jacobs |first=Jack |editor=Levy, Richard S. |year=2005 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, CA |isbn=978-1-85109-439-4 |pages=446–447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis1999"&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|1999|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scholars argue that Marx equated Judaism with capitalism in his essay, helping to spread that idea.

Wheen says that "Those critics, who see this as a foretaste of 'Mein Kampf', overlook one, essential point: in spite of the clumsy phraseology and crude stereotyping, the essay was actually written as a defense of the Jews. It was a retort to Bruno Bauer, who had argued that Jews should not be granted full civic rights and freedoms unless they were baptised as Christians".&lt;ref&gt;Wheen, F., Karl Marx, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; According to McLellan, Marx used the word ''Judentum'' colloquially, as meaning ''commerce'', arguing that Germans must be emancipated from the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] not Judaism or Jews in particular. McLellan concludes that readers should interpret the essay's second half as "an extended pun at Bauer's expense".&lt;ref&gt;McLellan 1980, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1900 and 1924, approximately 1.75 million Jews migrated to America, the bulk from Eastern Europe. Before 1900 American Jews had always amounted to less than 1% of America's total population, but by 1930 Jews formed about 3.5%. This increase, combined with the [[upward social mobility]] of some Jews, contributed to a resurgence of antisemitism. In the first half of the 20th century, in the US, Jews were discriminated against in employment, access to residential and resort areas, membership in clubs and organizations, and in tightened quotas on Jewish enrolment and teaching positions in colleges and universities. The lynching of [[Leo Frank]] by a mob of prominent citizens in [[Marietta, Georgia]] in 1915 turned the spotlight on antisemitism in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chanes|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ju7U83nRDt8C&amp;pg=PA72 72]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was also used to build support for the renewal of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] which had been inactive since 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levy|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tdn6FFZklkcC&amp;pg=PA243 vol. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;72]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, the [[Menahem Mendel Beilis|Beilis Trial]] in Russia represented incidents of [[blood libel|blood-libel]] in Europe. Christians used allegations of Jews killing Christians as a justification for the killing of Jews.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Antisemitism in America reached its peak during the [[interwar period]]. The pioneer automobile manufacturer [[Henry Ford]] propagated antisemitic ideas in his newspaper ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'' (published by Ford from 1919 to 1927). The radio speeches of [[Father Coughlin]] in the late 1930s attacked [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] and promoted the notion of a Jewish financial conspiracy. Some prominent politicians shared such views: [[Louis T. McFadden]], Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Banking and Currency]], blamed Jews for Roosevelt's decision to abandon the [[gold standard]], and claimed that "in the United States today, the Gentiles have the slips of paper while the Jews have the lawful money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arad |first=Gulie Ne'eman |title=America, Its Jews, and the Rise of Nazism |year=2000 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Indianapolis |isbn=978-0-253-33809-9 |page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1940s the [[aviator]] [[Charles Lindbergh]] and many prominent Americans led The [[America First Committee]] in opposing any involvement in the war against [[Fascism]]. During his July 1936 visit to [[Nazi Germany]], a few weeks before the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], Lindbergh wrote letters saying that there was "more intelligent leadership in Germany than is generally recognized". The [[German American Bund]] held parades in New York City during the late 1930s, where members wore [[Nazi]] uniforms and raised flags featuring [[swastika]]s alongside American flags.

In Germany, [[Nazism]] led [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]], who [[Machtergreifung|came to power]] on 30 January 1933 shortly afterwards instituted repressive legislation which denied the Jews basic civil rights.{{sfn|Majer|2014|p=60}}&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]] (7 April 1933)&lt;/ref&gt; 
In September 1935, the [[Nuremberg Laws]] prohibited sexual relations and marriages between "Aryans" and Jews as ''[[Rassenschande]]'' ("race disgrace") and stripped all German Jews, even quarter- and [[half-Jew]]s, of their citizenship, (their official title became "subjects of the state").{{sfn|Majer|2014|pp=113, 116, 118}} It instituted a pogrom on the night of 9–10 November 1938, dubbed ''[[Kristallnacht]]'', in which Jews were killed, their property destroyed and their synagogues torched.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw (2008) ''Fateful Choices'': 441-44&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemitic laws, agitation and propaganda were extended to [[German-occupied Europe]] in the wake of conquest, often building on local antisemitic traditions.

After [[Operation Barbarossa|the beginning]] of the war between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1941 a campaign of mass murder, conducted by the [[Einsatzgruppen]], culminated from 1942 to 1945 in systematic [[genocide]]: [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="saul1"&gt;[[Saul Friedländer]] (2008): ''The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews''.

Antisemitism was commonly used as an instrument for settling personal conflicts in the [[Soviet Union]], starting with the conflict between [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] and continuing through numerous conspiracy-theories spread by official propaganda. [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Antisemitism in the USSR]] reached new heights after 1948 during the campaign against the "[[rootless cosmopolitan]]" (euphemism for "Jew") in which numerous Yiddish-language poets, writers, painters and sculptors were killed or arrested.&lt;ref name="jcws"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Konstantin Azadovskii and Boris Egorov| title=From Anti-Westernism to Anti-Semitism| journal=Journal of Cold War Studies| year=2002| volume=4:1| issue=Winter| pages=66–80| url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hpcws/egorov.htm#REF31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of the Jewish Race| author1=Raphael| author2=Jennifer Patai| year=1989| page=178| publisher=Wayne State University Press| isbn=978-0-8143-1948-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in the so-called [[Doctors' Plot]] (1952–1953).

In Eastern Europe the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the instability of the new states has brought the rise of nationalist movements and the accusation against Jews for the economic crisis, taking over the local economy and bribing the government alongside with traditional and religious motives for antisemitism such as [[blood libel]]s. Most of the antisemitic incidents are against Jewish cemeteries and building (community centers and synagogues).

It has also been suggested that parts of antisemitism arose from a perception of Jewish people as greedy (as often used in [[Stereotypes of Jews#Greed|stereotypes of Jews]]), and this perception has probably evolved in Europe during Medieval times where a large portion of [[Moneylender|money lending]] was operated by Jews.&lt;ref name=Laqueur2006&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=IaloAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=154 Page 154] in: {{cite book|title=The Changing Face of Anti-Semitism: From Ancient Times to the Present Day|author=Walter Laqueur|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780199774739}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors contributing to this situation included that Jews were restricted from other professions,&lt;ref name=Laqueur2006/&gt; while the [[Christian Church]] declared for their followers that money lending constituted immoral "[[usury]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hawthorne's secret: an un-told tale|jstor=41398742|journal=The Georgia Review|volume=38|issue=3|pages=664–666|author=Philip Young|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Libya====
{{Further|History of the Jews in Libya}}
[[Libya]] had once one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world, dating back to 300 BCE. Despite the repression of Jews in the late 1930, as a result of the pro-Nazi Fascist Italian regime, Jews were third of the population of [[Tripoli|Libya]] till 1941. In 1942 the Nazi German troops occupied the Jewish quarter of Benghazi, plundering shops and deporting more than 2,000 Jews across the desert. Sent to work in labor camps, more than one-fifth of this group of Jews perished. A series of pogroms started in November 1945, while more than 140 Jews were killed in [[Tripoli]] and most synagogues in the city looted.&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;Harris, 2001, pp. 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon Libya's independence in 1951, most of the Jewish community emigrated from Libya. After the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, another series of pogroms forced all but about 100 Jews to flee. When [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] came to power in 1969, all remaining Jewish property was confiscated and all debts to Jews cancelled.

==== Morocco ====
{{Further|History of the Jews in Morocco}}

[[Jew]]ish communities, in [[Islam]]ic times often living in [[ghetto]]s known as ''[[mellah]]'', have existed in [[Morocco]] for at least 2,000 years. Intermittent large scale massacres (such as that of [[1033 Fez massacre|6,000 Jews in Fez]] in 1033, over 100,000 Jews in Fez and [[Marrakesh]] in 1146 and again in Marrakesh in 1232)&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morocco"&gt;For the events of Fez see Cohen, 1995, pp 180–182. On Marrekesh, see the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' of 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; were accompanied by systematic discrimination through the years.
In 1875, 20 Jews were killed by a mob in [[Demnat]], Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, Jews were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight.&lt;ref name=Gilbert179&gt;[[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Dearest Auntie Fori. The Story of the Jewish People''. HarperCollins, 2002, pp. 179–182.&lt;/ref&gt;
While the pro-Nazi [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime during [[World War II]] passed discriminatory laws against Jews, [[Mohammed V of Morocco|King Muhammad]] prevented deportation of Jews to death camps (although Jews with French, as opposed to Moroccan, citizenship, being directly subject to Vichy law, were still deported.)
In 1948, approximately 265,000 Jews lived in Morocco. Between 5,000 and 8,000 live there now.
In June 1948, soon after [[Israel]] was established and in the midst of the first Arab-Israeli war, riots against Jews broke out in [[Oujda]] and [[Djerada]], killing 44 Jews. In 1948-9, 18,000 Jews left the country for Israel. After this, Jewish emigration continued (to Israel and elsewhere), but slowed to a few thousand a year. Through the early fifties, [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations encouraged emigration, particularly in the poorer south of the country, seeing Moroccan Jews as valuable contributors to the Jewish State:
In 1955, Morocco attained independence and emigration to Israel has increased further until 1956 then it was prohibited until 1963, then resumed.[http://rickgold.home.mindspring.com/Emigration/emigration13.htm] By 1967, only 60,000 Jews remained in Morocco.
The [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 led to increased Arab-Jewish tensions worldwide, including Morocco. By 1971, the Jewish population was down to 35,000; however, most of this wave of emigration went to [[Europe]] and [[North America]] rather than [[Israel]].

==== South Africa ====
{{Further|History of the Jews in South Africa}}

Antisemitism has been present in history of [[South Africa]] since Europeans first set foot ashore on the [[Cape Peninsula]]. In the years 1652–1795 Jews were not allowed to settle at the Cape. An 1868 Act would sanction religious discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Milton | first =Shain | title =The roots of antisemitism in South Africa | publisher =Wiwatersrand University Press | year =1994 | location =Johannesburg | pages =9–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemitism reached its apotheosis in the years leading up to [[World War II]]. Inspired by the rise of [[national socialism]] in [[Germany]] the [[Ossewabrandwag]] (OB) – whose membership accounted for almost 25% of the 1940 [[Afrikaner]] population – and the National Party faction ''New Order'' would champion a more programmatic solution to the 'Jewish problem'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/south-africa/23.htm|title=South Africa - The Impact of World War II|website=countrystudies.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tunisia ====
{{Further|History of the Jews in Tunisia}}

Jews have lived in Tunisia for at least 2,300 years. In the 13th century, Jews were expelled from their homes in [[Kairouan]] and were ultimately restricted to ghettos, known as ''hara''. Forced to wear distinctive clothing, several Jews earned high positions in the Tunisian government. Several prominent international traders were Tunisian Jews. From 1855 to 1864, [[Muhammad Bey]] relaxed dhimmi laws, but reinstated them in the face of anti-Jewish riots that continued at least until 1869.
Tunisia, as the only Middle Eastern country under direct [[Nazism|Nazi]] control during World War II, was also the site of racist antisemitic measures activities such as the yellow star, prison camps, deportations, and other persecution.
In 1948, approximately 105,000 Jews lived in [[Tunisia]]. Only about 1,500 remain there today. Following Tunisia's independence from France in 1956, a number of anti-Jewish policies led to emigration, of which half went to Israel and the other half to France. After attacks in 1967, Jewish emigration both to Israel and [[France]] accelerated.

For example, in February 2012, when Egyptian cleric Wagdi Ghanaim entered Tunisia, he was welcomed by Islamists who chanted "Death to the Jews" as a sign of their support. The following month, during protests in Tunis, a Salafi sheikh told young Tunisians to gather and learn to kill Jews.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the past, The Tunisian government has made efforts to block Jews from entering high positions, and some moderate members have tried to cover up the more extremist anti-Semitic efforts by appointing Jews to governmental positions, however, it is known that Muslim clerics believe that if the Muslim Brotherhood leads the regime, that will enhance their hatred towards Jews.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In response to the prevalent anti-Semitism, the Tunisian government has publicly protected the dwindling population and its marks of Jewish culture, for example, synagogues, and advised them to settle in Djerba, a French tourist attraction.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/world/tunisian-synagogue-blast-called-accident.html|title=Tunisian Synagogue Blast Called Accident|last=Jr.|first=Donald G.

[[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], former president of Iran, has frequently been accused of denying the Holocaust.

In July, the winner of Iran's first annual International [[Wall Street]] Downfall Cartoon Festival, jointly sponsored by the semi-state-run Iranian media outlet [[Fars News]], was an antisemitic cartoon depicting Jews praying before the [[New York Stock Exchange]], which is made to look like the [[Western Wall]]. Other cartoons in the contest were antisemitic as well. The national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, condemned the cartoon, stating that "Here's the anti-Semitic notion of Jews and their love for money, the canard that Jews 'control' Wall Street, and a cynical perversion of the Western Wall, the holiest site in Judaism," and "Once again Iran takes the prize for promoting antisemitism."&lt;ref name="The Algemeiner"&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-Semitic Cartoon Wins Iranian Festival Prize|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/07/11/anti-semitic-cartoon-wins-iranian-festival-prize/|accessdate=11 July 2012|newspaper=The Algemeiner|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Jewish Chronicle"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rocker|first=Simon|title=Iran gives antisemitic cartoon top prize|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/69827/iran-gives-antisemitic-cartoon-top-prize|accessdate=11 July 2012|newspaper=The Jewish Chronicle|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ADL&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Semitic Cartoon Declared Winner Of Iranian 'Wall Street Downfall' Festival|url=http://altwire.utne.com/zine/israel-palestine_new/antisemitic-cartoon-declared-winner-of-i/5547314632322f6f30586535547a61726a6e747545413d3d|website=The Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his treatise on Malay identity, "The Malay Dilemma," which was published in 1970, former Malaysian Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]] wrote: "The Jews are not only hooked-nosed... but understand money instinctively.... Jewish stinginess and financial wizardry gained them the economic control of Europe and provoked antisemitism which waxed and waned throughout Europe through the ages."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-abraham-cooper/malaysia-anti-semitism_b_903767.html In Malaysia, When in Doubt, Blame the Jews] by Rabbi Abraham Cooper, ''[[Huffington Post]]'', 22 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Malay-language [[Utusan Malaysia]] daily stated in an editorial that Malaysians "cannot allow anyone, especially the Jews, to interfere secretly in this country's business... When the drums are pounded hard in the name of human rights, the pro-Jewish people will have their best opportunity to interfere in any Islamic country," the newspaper said. "We might not realize that the enthusiasm to support actions such as demonstrations will cause us to help foreign groups succeed in their mission of controlling this country."

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1987-004-09A, Amin al Husseini und Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|[[Haj Amin al-Husseini]] is a central figure of [[Palestinian nationalism]] in Mandatory Palestine. He took refuge and collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II. He met [[Adolf Hitler]] in December 1941. Scholarly opinion is divided on the Mufti's antisemitsm, with many scholars viewing him as a staunch antisemite&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sachar|1961|p=231}},&lt;/ref&gt; while some deny the appropriateness of the term, or argue that he became antisemitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laurens|2002|pp=467,469–470}};'In terms of his initial formation, Haj Amin was far from being an antisemite. He had learnt French at the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] institute in Jerusalem and [[Albert Antébi]] had been one of his mentors. In the interwar period, he had fought Zionism as a political and religious leader. He was then of the opinion that the aim of Zionism was to expel the Arabs of Palestine and take over the [[Haram al-Sharif]] in order to build the [[Third Temple]]. Gradually (''progressivement'') he was persuaded that world Judaism supported Zionists in an secretive manner and exercised a major influence over decision-making in Great Britain and the United States. For some time (during WW2) he was certain (based on real facts) that the Zionists were seeking to assassinate him. … It is evident that he gradually came to identify his battle in Palestine with that of Germany against world Judaism. The reading of all those passages in his memoirs devoted to his European sojourn reveal an assimilation of the content of european antisemitism, with their two great themes of the identification of Judaism with financial capitalism (Anglo-Saxons), and of the [[Stab-in-the-back myth|legend of the stab in the back]] (the Jews as responsible for the two world wars). On the other hand, a racist vision of world history is totally absent from his general worldview. … Taken together, his writings after 1945 do not show him as having an attitude of [[negationism|holocaust denial]], whilst Arab politicians of the first rank, in the period of Eichmann's trial, had begun to adopt (precisely) this kind of discourse.'&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In March 2011, the Israeli government issued a paper claiming that "Anti-Israel and anti-Semitic messages are heard regularly in the government and private media and in the mosques and are taught in school books," to the extent that they are "an integral part of the fabric of life inside the PA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gov't aggressively goes after Palestinian incitement |author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Govt-aggressively-goes-after-Palestinian-incitement |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Israeli Strategic Affairs Ministry director-general Yossi Kuperwasser stated that Palestinian incitement to antisemitism is "going on all the time" and that it is "worrying and disturbing." At an institutional level, he said the PA has been promoting three key messages to the Palestinian people that constitute incitement: "that the Palestinians would eventually be the sole sovereign on all the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea; that Jews, especially those who live in Israel, were not really human beings but rather 'the scum of mankind'; and that all tools were legitimate in the struggle against Israel and the Jews."&lt;ref name="kuperwasser"&gt;{{cite news |title='Palestinian incitement continuing unabated'|author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Palestinian-incitement-continuing-unabated |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 August 2012 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, the [[Hamas]]' spokesman in Doha said on live television that [[Blood libel|Jews use blood to make matzos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/384542/top-hamas-offical-jews-use-blood-matzos-molly-wharton Top Hamas Official: Jews Use Blood for Matzos]."

According to a 2004 report from the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], antisemitism had increased significantly in Europe since 2000, with significant increases in verbal attacks against Jews and vandalism such as graffiti, fire bombings of Jewish schools, desecration of synagogues and cemeteries. Germany, France, Britain, and Russia are the countries with the highest rate of antisemitic incidents in Europe.&lt;ref name = "mgjmsp" /&gt; The Netherlands and Sweden have also consistently had high rates of antisemitic attacks since 2000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The 2005 U.S. State Department Report on Global Antisemitism.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that recent European antisemitic violence can actually be seen as a spillover from the long running [[Arab–Israeli conflict|Arab-Israeli conflict]] since the majority of the perpetrators are from the [[Islam in Europe|large Muslim immigrant communities in European cities]]. However, compared to France, the United Kingdom and much of the rest of Europe, in Germany Arab and pro-Palestinian groups are involved in only a small percentage of antisemitic incidents.&lt;ref name = "mgjmsp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/ Stephen Roth Institute, Tel Aviv University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817134910/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/ |date=17 August 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism'', most of the more extreme attacks on Jewish sites and physical attacks on Jews in Europe come from militant Islamic and Muslim groups, and most Jews tend to be assaulted in countries where groups of young Muslim immigrants reside.&lt;ref name=roth&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2004/general-analysis.htm GENERAL ANALYSIS 2004], The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism, Tel Aviv University.

On 1 January 2006, Britain's chief [[rabbi]], Lord [[Jonathan Sacks]], warned that what he called a "tsunami of antisemitism" was spreading globally. In an interview with [[BBC Radio 4]], Sacks said: "A number of my rabbinical colleagues throughout Europe have been assaulted and attacked on the streets. We've had synagogues desecrated. We've had Jewish schools burnt to the ground—not here but in France. People are attempting to silence and even ban Jewish societies on campuses on the grounds that Jews must support the state of Israel, therefore they should be banned, which is quite extraordinary because... British Jews see themselves as British citizens. So it's that kind of feeling that you don't know what's going to happen next that's making... some European Jewish communities uncomfortable."&lt;ref name=Gillan&gt;Gillan, Audrey.

Following an escalation in antisemitism in 2012, which included the [[Toulouse and Montauban shootings|deadly shooting of three children]] at a Jewish school in France, the [[European Jewish Congress]] demanded in July a more proactive response. EJC President Moshe Kantor explained, "We call on authorities to take a more proactive approach so there would be no reason for statements of regret and denunciation. All these smaller attacks remind me of smaller tremors before a massive earthquake. The Jewish community cannot afford to be subject to an earthquake and the authorities cannot say that the writing was not on the wall." He added that European countries should take legislative efforts to ban any form of [[incitement]], as well as to equip the authorities with the necessary tools to confront any attempt to expand [[terrorist]] and violent activities against Jewish communities in Europe.&lt;ref name=EJP&gt;{{cite news|last=Shamee|first=Maureen|title='Proactive' response needed to escalation of anti-Semitic attacks across Europe, says European Jewish Congress|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/news/uk/59964|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=European Jewish Press|date=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Mohammed Merah [[Toulouse and Montauban shootings|opened fire at a Jewish school]] in Toulouse, killing a teacher and three children. An 8-year-old girl was shot in the head at point blank range. President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] said that it was "obvious" it was an antisemitic attack&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=School Shooting Gun Same As Other Attacks|url=http://news.sky.com/home/world-news/article/16191704|newspaper=Sky News|date=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that, "I want to say to all the leaders of the Jewish community, how close we feel to them. All of France is by their side." The Israeli Prime Minister condemned the "despicable anti-Semitic" murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Netanyahu: Murder in French Jewish school a 'despicable anti-Semitic' attack|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/netanyahu-murder-in-french-jewish-school-a-despicable-anti-semitic-attack-1.419570|publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Toulouse shooting: Same gun and motorbike used in Jewish and soldier attacks|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/9152469/France-school-shooting-Four-dead-at-Ozar-Hatorah-school-in-Toulouse.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a 32-hour siege and standoff with the police outside his house, and a French raid, Merah jumped off a balcony and was shot in the head and killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McNicoll|first=Tracy|title=Mohamed Merah Dies in French Standoff’s Gory End|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/03/22/mohamed-merah-dies-in-french-standoff-s-gory-end.html|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merah told police during the standoff that he intended to keep on attacking, and he loved death the way the police loved life.

4 months later, in July 2012, a French Jewish teenager wearing a "distinctive religious symbol" was the victim of a violent antisemitic attack on a train travelling between Toulouse and Lyon. The teen was first verbally harassed and later beaten up by two assailants. [[Richard Prasquier]] from the French Jewish umbrella group, [[Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France|CRIF]], called the attack "another development in the worrying trend of anti-Semitism in our country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Toulouse yeshiva student beaten up in anti-Semitic attack Read more: Toulouse yeshiva student beaten up in anti-Semitic attack|newspaper=[[Times of Israel]]|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another incident in July 2012 dealt with the vandalism of the synagogue of [[Noisy-le-Grand]] of the [[Seine-Saint-Denis]] district in [[Paris]]. The synagogue was vandalized three times in a ten-day period. Prayer books and shawls were thrown on the floor, windows were shattered, drawers were ransacked, and walls, tables, clocks, and floors were vandalized. The authorities were alerted of the incidents by the Bureau National de Vigilance Contre L'Antisémtisme (BNVCA), a French antisemitism watchdog group, which called for more measures to be taken to prevent future hate crimes. BNVCA President Sammy Ghozlan stated that, "Despite the measures taken, things persist, and I think that we need additional legislation, because the Jewish community is annoyed."&lt;ref name=Algemeiner1&gt;{{cite news|title=French Synagogue Vandalized For Third Time in Ten Days|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/07/12/french-synagogue-vandalized-for-third-time-in-ten-days/|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=Algemeiner|date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, [[Abraham Cooper]], the dean of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], met French Interior Minister [[Manuel Valls]] and reported that antisemitic attacks against French Jews increased by 40% since [[Toulouse and Montauban shootings|Merah's shooting spree]] in [[Toulouse]]. Cooper pressed Valls to take extra measures to secure the safety of French Jews, as well as to discuss strategies to foil an increasing trend of lone-wolf terrorists on the Internet.&lt;ref name="IHA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=5606 | title=Anti-Semitic attacks in France surge by 40% since March | publisher=Israel Hayom | website=Reuters; Israel Hayom | date=29 August 2012 | accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, two women were assaulted in Germany, sprayed with tear gas, and were shown a "[[Nazi salute|Hitler salute]]," apparently because of a [[Star of David]] necklace that they wore.&lt;ref name="Frauen im"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nordbayern.de/region/fuerth/frauen-im-freizeitbad-beleidigt-und-mit-reizgas-bespruht-1.2227517 | title=Frauen im Freizeitbad beleidigt und mit Reizgas besprüht | publisher=Nordbayern | date=3 August 2012 | accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August 2012, [[Berlin]] police investigated an attack on a 53-year-old rabbi and his 6-year-old daughter, allegedly by four Arab teens, after which the rabbi needed treatment for head wounds at a hospital. The police classified the attack as a hate crime. ''Jüdische Allgemeine'' reported that the rabbi was wearing a [[kippah]] and was approached by one of the teens, who asked the rabbi if he was Jewish. The teen then attacked the rabbi while yelling antisemitic comments, and threatened to kill the rabbi's daughter. Berlin's mayor condemned the attack, saying that "Berlin is an international city in which intolerance, xenophobia and anti-Semitism are not being tolerated. Police will undertake all efforts to find and arrest the perpetrators."&lt;ref name="VoNG"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vosizneias.com/112634/2012/08/29/germany-berlin-rabbi-and-his-six-year-old-daughter-become-victims-of-a-hate-crime/ | title=Germany – Berlin Rabbi And His Six-Year-Old Daughter Become Victims Of A Hate Crime | publisher=Vos Iz Neias | date=29 August 2012 | accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, various historians, including Dr. Julius H. Schoeps, a prominent German-Jewish historian and a member of the German Interior Ministry's commission to combat antisemitism, charged the majority of [[Bundestag]] deputies with failing to understand antisemitism and the imperativeness of periodic legislative reports on German antisemitism. Schoeps cited various antisemitic statements by German parliament members as well. The report in question determined that 15% of Germans are antisemitic while over 20% espouse "latent anti-Semitism," but the report has been criticized for downplaying the sharpness of antisemitism in Germany, as well as for failing to examine anti-Israel media coverage in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=289609 | title=Historian slams Germany for ignoring anti-semitism | publisher=The Jerusalem Post | date=28 October 2012 | accessdate=29 October 2012 |author=Weinthal, Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greece====
{{Main|Antisemitism in Greece}}

Antisemitism in Greece manifests itself in religious, political and media discourse. The recent [[Greek government-debt crisis]] has facilitated the rise of far right groups in Greece, most notably the formerly obscure [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]].
Jews have lived in Greece since antiquity, but the largest community of around 20,000 [[Sephardic Jews]] settled in [[Thessalonica]] after an invitation from the [[Ottoman Sultan]] in the 15th century. After Thessalonica was annexed to Greece in 1913, the Greek government recognized Jews as Greek citizens with full rights and attributed Judaism the status of a recognized and protected religion. Currently in Greece, Jewish communities representing the 5,000 Greek Jews are legal entities under public law. 
According to the [[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]] (Anti-Defamation League) report of 2015, the "ADL Global 100", a report of the status of antisemitism in 100 countries around the world, 69% of the adult population in Greece harbor antisemitic attitudes and 85% think that "Jews have too much power in the business world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ADL Global 100: Greece|url=http://global100.adl.org/#country/greece/2014|website=ADL Global 100|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2015, a survey about the Greeks' perceptions of the holocaust was published. Its findings showed that less than 60 percent of the respondents think that holocaust teaching should be included in the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=van Versendaal|first1=Harry|title=Victimhood culture spawns Greek anti-Semitism, study finds|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/168389/article/ekathimerini/community/victimhood-culture-spawns-greek-anti-semitism-study-finds|accessdate=31 August 2015|work=ekathimerini|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hungary====

[[File:Jobbik-NewHungarianGuard-May2013.jpg|thumb|150px|Members of the New Hungarian Guard stand at a Jobbik rally against a gathering of the [[World Jewish Congress]] in Budapest, 4 May 2013]]
In the 21st century, antisemitism in Hungary has evolved and received an institutional framework, while verbal and physical aggression against Jews has escalated, creating a great difference between its earlier manifestations in the 1990s and recent developments. One of the major representatives of this institutionalized antisemitic ideology is the popular Hungarian party [[Jobbik]], which received 17 percent of the vote in the April 2010 national election. The far-right subculture, which ranges from nationalist shops to radical-nationalist and neo-Nazi festivals and events, plays a major role in the institutionalization of Hungarian antisemitism in the 21st century. The contemporary antisemitic rhetoric has been updated and expanded, but is still based on the old antisemitic notions. The traditional accusations and motifs include such phrases as Jewish occupation, international Jewish conspiracy, Jewish responsibility for the [[Treaty of Trianon]], Judeo-Bolshevism, as well as blood libels against Jews. Nevertheless, the past few years have seen the reemergence of the blood libel and an increase in Holocaust relativization and denial, while the monetary crisis has revived references to the "Jewish banker class".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/article/anti-semitism-in-hungary/|title=Anti-Semitism in Hungary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy====
{{Main|Antisemitism in 21st-century Italy}}

The ongoing political conflict between Israel and Palestine has played an important role in the development and expression of [[antisemitism in the 21st century]], and in Italy as well. The [[Second Intifada]], which began in late September 2000, has set in motion unexpected mechanisms, whereby traditional anti-Jewish prejudices were mixed with politically based stereotypes.&lt;ref name=EUMC&gt;{{cite web|title=Manifestations of anti-Semitism in the European Union|url=http://www.erinnern.at/bundeslaender/oesterreich/e_bibliothek/antisemitismus-1/431_anti-semitism_in_the_european_union.pdf|publisher=EUMC|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this belief system, Israeli Jews were charged with full responsibility for the fate of the peace process and with the conflict presented as embodying the struggle between good (the Palestinians) and evil (the Israeli Jews).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antisemitism Summary overview of the situation in the European Union 2001–2011|url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/2215-FRA-2012-Antisemitism-update-2011_EN.pdf|publisher=FRA|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
{{Further|History of the Jews in the Netherlands}}
The [[Netherlands]] has the second highest incidence of antisemitic incidents in the European Union. However, it is difficult to obtain exact figures because the specific groups against whom attacks are made are not specifically identified in police reports, and analyses of police data for antisemitism therefore relies on key-word searches, e.g. "Jew" or "Israel". According to Centre for Information and Documentation on Israel (CIDI), a pro-Israel lobby group in the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Over CIDI (Dutch)|url=http://www.cidi.nl/over-cidi/|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the number of antisemitic incidents reported in the whole of the Netherlands was 108 in 2008, 93 in 2009, and 124 in 2010. Some two thirds of this are acts of aggression. There are approximately 52 000 [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Nieuwe CIDI Monitor antisemitisme" (Dutch)|url=http://www.niw.nl/nieuwe-cidi-monitor-antisemitisme/|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NRC Handelsblad newspaper, the number of antisemitic incidents in [[Amsterdam]] was 14 in 2008 and 30 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Berkhout, Karel.

Retrieved on 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Raphaël Evers, an [[Orthodox judaism|orthodox]] rabbi in [[Amsterdam]], told the [[Norway|Norwegian]] newspaper [[Aftenposten]] that Jews can no longer be safe in the city anymore due to the risk of violent assaults. "We Jews no longer feel at home here in the Netherlands. Many people talk about moving to Israel," he said.&lt;ref name="aftenposten.no"&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/article3584266.ece Hets av jøder er økende i Europa – Aftenposten] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411225535/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/article3584266.ece |date=11 April 2012 }}. Aftenposten.no. Retrieved 2 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Anne Frank Foundation]], antisemitism in the Netherlands in 2011 was roughly at the same level as in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nieuwe rapportage – anne frank|url=http://m.annefrank.org/key/aWQ9MTUwMjQmbGM9bmw=|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual antisemitic incidents increased from 19 in 2010 to 30 in 2011. Verbal antisemitic incidents dropped slightly from 1173 in 2010 to 1098 in 2011. This accounts for 75%–80% of all verbal racist incidents in the Netherlands. Antisemitism is more prevalent in the age group 23–27 years, which is a younger group than that of racist incidents in general.

====Norway====
{{Main|Antisemitism in Norway}}
In 2010, the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] after one year of research, revealed that antisemitism was common among some 8th, 9th, and 10th graders in Oslo's schools. Teachers at schools with large numbers of [[Muslim]]s revealed that Muslim students often "praise or admire Adolf Hitler for his killing of [[Jew]]s", that "Jew-hate is legitimate within vast groups of Muslim students" and that "Muslims laugh or command [teachers] to stop when trying to educate about the [[Holocaust]]". Additionally, "while some students might protest when some express support for [[terrorism]], none object when students express hate of Jews", saying that it says in "the [[Quran]] that you shall kill Jews, all true Muslims hate Jews". Most of these students were said to be born and raised in Norway. One [[Jew]]ish father also stated that his child had been taken by a Muslim mob after school (though the child managed to escape), reportedly "to be taken out to the forest and [[lynching|hung]] because he was a Jew".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057|work=NRK Lørdagsrevyen|title=Jødiske blir hetset|date=13 March 2010|access-date=5 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419230618/http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057|archive-date=19 April 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What about Norwegian anti-Semitism?|url=http://theforeigner.no/pages/columns/what-about-norwegian-anti-semitism/|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=The Foreigner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norwegian Education Minister Kristin Halvorsen referred to the antisemitism reported in this study as being "completely unacceptable." The head of a local Islamic council joined Jewish leaders and Halvorsen in denouncing such antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-semitism report shocks officials|url=http://www.newsinenglish.no/2010/03/16/anti-semitism-report-shocks-officials/|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=News in English – News and Views from Norway|date=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, the [[Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe]] issued a report regarding antisemitism in Norway, criticizing Norway for an increase in antisemitism in the country and blaming Norwegian officials for failing to address antisemitism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/10/26/report-criticizes-norway-for-rise-in-anti-semitism/ | title=Report Criticizes Norway for Rise in Anti-Semitism | publisher=The Algemeiner | date=26 October 2012 | accessdate=28 October 2012 | author=Pontz, Zach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 2000s, levels of antisemitism in Russia have been low, and steadily decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://regnum.ru/news/society/1895352.html В Москве представлен отчет об антисемитизме в 2014 году] Москва, 13 Февраля 2015, 21:46 — REGNUM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=feor&gt;[http://ria.ru/interview/20141107/1032029411.html Президент ФЕОР: Россия — "остров спокойствия" на фоне Западной Европы] 11:0007.11.2014 (обновлено: 11:42 07.11.2014)&lt;/ref&gt; President of the [[Russian Jewish Congress]] attributes this in part to the vanished state sponsorship of antisemitism.

Still, since the mid-2000s incorporation of antisemitic discourse into the platforms and speeches of nationalist political movements in Russia has been reported by [[human rights]] monitors in Russia as well as in the press.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} A number of prominent modern Russian politicians are known for their  antisemitic views.

After Germany and Austria, Sweden has the highest rate of antisemitic incidents in Europe, though the Netherlands has reported a higher rate of antisemitism in some years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A government study in 2006 estimated that 15% of Swedes agree with the statement: "The Jews have too much influence in the world today".&lt;ref name="GovStudy"&gt;Henrik Bachner and Jonas Ring.{{cite web|url=http://intolerans.levandehistoria.se/article/article_docs/antisemitism_english.pdf |title=Antisemitic images and attitudes in Sweden |accessdate=21 February 2007 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221140257/http://intolerans.levandehistoria.se/article/article_docs/antisemitism_english.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2007 |df=dmy }} . levandehistoria.se&lt;/ref&gt; 5% of the total adult population and 39% of adult Muslims "harbour systematic antisemitic views".&lt;ref name="GovStudy"/&gt; The former prime minister [[Göran Persson]] described these results as "surprising and terrifying". However, the rabbi of Stockholm's Orthodox Jewish community, Meir Horden, said that "It's not true to say that the Swedes are anti-Semitic.

In 2009, a synagogue that served the Jewish community in Malmö was set ablaze. Jewish cemeteries were repeatedly desecrated, worshippers were abused while returning home from prayer, and masked men mockingly chanted "Hitler" in the streets. As a result of security concerns, Malmö's synagogue has guards and rocket-proof glass in the windows, and the Jewish kindergarten can only be reached through thick steel security doors.&lt;ref name="Malmo Jews leaving Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/sweden/7278532/Jews-leave-Swedish-city-after-sharp-rise-in-anti-Semitic-hate-crimes.html | title=Jews leave Swedish city after sharp rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes | work=The Telegraph | date=21 February 2012 | accessdate=24 July 2012 | author=Meo, Nick | location=Malmo, Sweden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 an [[Institute for Jewish Policy Research]] survey found that the levels of anti-Semitism in Great Britain were among the lowest in the world, with 2.4% expressing multiple anti-Semitic attitudes, and about 70% having a favourable opinion of Jews. However, only 17% had a favourable opinion of Israel, with 33% holding an unfavourable view.&lt;ref name=bbc-20170913&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41241353 |title=Over a quarter of British people 'hold anti-Semitic attitudes', study finds |last=May |first=Callum |work=BBC News |date=13 September 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jpr-201709&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.jpr.org.uk/documents/JPR.2017.Antisemitism_in_contemporary_Great_Britain.pdf |title=Antisemitism in contemporary Great Britain |author=L.

In 2017, a report by the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) found that the previous year, 2016, had been the worst on record for antisemitic hate crime in the UK.&lt;ref name="Campaign Against Antisemitism"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://antisemitism.uk/crime|title=National Antisemitic Crime Audit|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|date=1 May 2016|access-date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, 2015 had been the worst year on record, and 2014 was the worst year on record before that. The report found that in 2016, antisemitic crime rose by 15% compared to 2015, or 45% compared to 2014. It also found that 1 in 10 antisemitic crimes was violent. Despite rising levels of antisemitic crime, the report said there had been a decrease in the [[Criminal charge|charging]] of antisemitic crime. In the report's foreword, the CAA's Chairman wrote: "Britain has the political will to fight antisemitism and strong laws with which to do it, but those responsible for tackling the rapidly growing racist targeting of British Jews are failing to enforce the law. There is a very real danger of Jewish citizens emigrating, as has happened elsewhere in Europe unless there is radical change."&lt;ref name="Campaign Against Antisemitism"/&gt;

Every year since 2015, the CAA has commissioned polling by [[YouGov]] concerning the attitude of the British public toward British Jews. In 2017, their polling found that 36% of British adults believed at least one of the antisemitic statements pollsters had shown them to be true, a reduction from 39% in 2016 and 45% in 2015. Additionally, the polling revealed widespread fear amongst British Jews, with almost 1 in 3 saying that they had considered emigrating in the last two years due to antisemitism, and 37% saying that they concealed their Judaism in public. The report gave various indications as to the cause of the fears, with British Jews identifying Islamist antisemitism, far-left antisemitism and far-right antisemitism as their main concerns, in that order. 78% of British Jews saying that they had witnessed antisemitism disguised as a political comment about Israel, 76% thoughts that political developments were contributing antisemitism, and 52% felt that the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] was not doing enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antisemitism.uk/barometer/|title=Antisemitism Barometer|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|date=11 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205173252/https://antisemitism.uk/barometer/|archive-date=5 February 2017|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antisemitism.uk/barometer-full-report|title=Annual Antisemitic Barometer 2015 Full Report|type=PDF|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a group of British [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] set up an inquiry into antisemitism, which published its findings in 2006. Its report stated that "until recently, the prevailing opinion both within the Jewish community and beyond [had been] that antisemitism had receded to the point that it existed only on the margins of society." It found a reversal of this progress since 2000. The inquiry was reconstituted following a surge in antisemitic incidents in Britain during the summer of 2014, and the new inquiry published its report in 2015, making recommendations for reducing antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/129862/key-recommendations-include-call-police-and-council-involvement|title=Key recommendations include call for police and council involvement|website=www.thejc.com|access-date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although antisemitism in Canada is less prevalent than in many other countries, there have been recent incidents. For example, a 2004 study identified 24 incidents of antisemitism between 14 March and 14 July 2004 in Newfoundland, Montreal, Quebec City, Ottawa, the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), and some smaller Ontario communities. The incidents included vandalism and other attacks on four synagogues, six cemeteries, four schools, and a number of businesses and private residences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-prutschi-f04.htm|title=Anti-Semitism in Canada  - Manuel Prutschi|website=www.jcpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the [[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] examined antisemitism on college campuses. It reported that "incidents of threatened bodily injury, physical intimidation or property damage are now rare", but antisemitism still occurs on many campuses and is a "serious problem." The Commission recommended that the [[U.S. Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] protect college students from antisemitism through vigorous enforcement of ''Title VI'' of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and further recommended that [[United States Congress|Congress]] clarify that Title VI applies to discrimination against Jewish students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eusccr.com/Ending%20Campus%20Ant-Semitism1.htm Ending Campus Anti-Semitism].

On 19 September 2006, [[Yale University]] founded the [[Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Anti-Semitism]] (YIISA), the first North American university-based center for study of the subject, as part of its Institution for Social and Policy Studies. Director [[Charles A.

After carrying out a routine review, the faculty review committee said that the initiative had not met its research and teaching standards. [[Donald Green]], then head of Yale's Institution for Social and Policy Studies, the body under whose aegis the antisemitism initiative was run, said that it had not had many papers published in the relevant leading journals or attracted many students.

A 2007 survey by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) concluded that 15% of Americans hold antisemitic views, which was in-line with the average of the previous ten years, but a decline from the 29% of the early sixties. The survey concluded that education was a strong predictor, "with most educated Americans being remarkably free of prejudicial views." The belief that Jews have too much power was considered a common antisemitic view by the ADL. Other views indicating antisemitism, according to the survey, include the view that Jews are more loyal to Israel than America, and that they are responsible for the death of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]]. The survey found that antisemitic Americans are likely to be intolerant generally, e.g. regarding immigration and free-speech. The 2007 survey also found that 29% of foreign-born [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]] and 32% of [[African American|African-Americans]] hold strong antisemitic beliefs, three times more than the 10% for whites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/poll_2007/ ADL Survey: American Attitudes Towards Jews in America].

In August 2012, the [[California state assembly]] approved a [[non-binding resolution]] that "encourages university leaders to combat a wide array of anti-Jewish and anti-Israel actions," although the resolution "is purely symbolic and does not carry policy implications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/calif-resolution-denouncing-anti-semitism-on-college-campuses-targets-anti-israel-protests/2012/08/29/17a0188a-f1b2-11e1-b74c-84ed55e0300b_story.html|title=Calif. resolution denouncing anti-Semitism on college campuses targets anti-Israel protests|website=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, ''[[Politico|Politico Magazine]]'' published an article purporting to show links between U.S. President [[Donald Trump]], Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] and the Jewish outreach organization [[Chabad-Lubavitch]]. The article was widely condemned, with the head of the Anti-Defamation League [[Jonathan Greenblatt]] saying that it "evokes age-old myths about Jews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zalman|first1=Jonathan|title=Politico’s Dubious Chabad Story Receives Widespread Criticism|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/229930/politicos-dubious-chabad-story-receives-widespread-criticism|accessdate=10 April 2017|publisher=Tablet Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Politico goes full ‘Elders of Zion,’ silenced by the college mob &amp; other comments|url=https://nypost.com/2017/04/10/politico-goes-full-elders-of-zion-silenced-by-the-college-mob-other-comments/|accessdate=10 April 2017|publisher=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Jonathan Greenblatt, national director and CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, stated in an interview, “While anti-Semitic attitudes have remained consistent at 14%... anti-Semitic incidents have been on the rise. In 2016 we saw a 34% increase over the prior year in acts of harassment, vandalism, or violence directed at Jewish individuals and institutions. During the first three quarters of 2017, there was a 67% increase over the same period in 2016. We’ve seen double the number of incidents in K-12 schools, and almost a 60% increase on college campuses." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reformjudaism.org/blog/2017/11/27/we-cant-just-rely-old-tactics|title=We Can't Just Rely on the Old Tactics|website=ReformJudaism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Apophthegmata Patrum''''' (lit. '''''Sayings of the Fathers''''')&lt;ref&gt;From the Greek: ''apo'', from; ''phtheggomai'', to cry out; ''pater, father''.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-la|Apophthegmata Patrum Aegyptiorum}} {{lang-el|ἀποφθέγματα τῶν ἁγίων γερόντων, ἀποφθέγματα τῶν πατέρων, τὸ γεροντικόν}})&lt;ref&gt;''Orthodox Encyclopedia, in Russian, Vol. 3, pp. 140-142.''&lt;/ref&gt; is the name given to various collections popularly known as of ''Sayings of the Desert Fathers'', consisting of stories and sayings attributed to the [[Desert Fathers]] and [[Desert Mothers]] from approximately the 5th century AD.&lt;ref name="Gould"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gould|first=Graham|title=Papers presented at the Thirteenth International Conference on Patristic Studies held in Oxford 1999|series=Studia Patristica|year=2001|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=978-90-429-0922-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''W. Bousset. Apophthegmata. Tuebingen, 1923, p. 68.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The collections consist of wisdom stories describing the spiritual practices and experiences of early Christian hermits living in the desert of Egypt. They are typically in the form of a conversation between a younger monk and his spiritual father, or as advice given to visitors. Beginning as an [[oral tradition]] in the [[Coptic language]], they were only later written down as Greek text. The stories were extremely popular among early Christian monks, and appeared in various forms and collections.&lt;ref name="Burton-Christie"&gt;{{cite book |author=Burton-Christie, Douglas |title=The Word in the desert: scripture and the quest for holiness in early Christian monasticism |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1993|pages=76–84 |isbn=0-19-508333-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SIa0mNas_5MC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original sayings were passed down from monk to monk, though in their current version most simply describe the stories in the form of "Abba X said...." The early Desert Fathers and Desert Mothers also received many visitors seeking counseling, typically by asking "Give me a word, ''abba''" or "Speak a word, ''amma'', how can I be saved?" Some of the sayings are responses to those seeking guidance.&lt;ref name="Chryssavgis"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Chryssavgis, John |author2=Ware, Kallistos |author3=Ward, Benedicta |title=In the Heart of the Desert: Revised Edition: The Spirituality of the Desert Fathers and Mothers (Treasures of the World's Religions) |publisher=World Wisdom |page=4|location=Bloomington, Ind. |year=2008|isbn=1-933316-56-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goeFHFiL2h0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the text==
The Desert Fathers spoke [[Coptic language|Coptic]], a language related to ancient Egyptian. The sayings were originally passed on orally in that language. The earliest written record of the sayings appears to be from the end of the 4th century AD. Two versions from the 5th century, the ''[[Ethiopic Collectio Monastica|Collectio Monastica]]'', written in [[Ethiopic]], and the [[Asceticon|Asceticon of Abba Isaiah]], written in Greek, show how the oral tradition became the written collections.&lt;ref name="Burton-Christie" /&gt;

[[Pelagius]] and [[John the Deacon (Egyptian chronicler)|John the Deacon]] made the first translations of the ''Sayings'' into Latin. [[Martin of Braga]] also translated some of the sayings into Latin, followed by a more extensive translation by Paschasius of Dumium in approximately 555 AD.&lt;ref name="Iberian"&gt;{{cite book |author=Barlow, Claude |title=Fathers of the Church: Iberian Fathers: Martin of Braga/Paschasius of Dumium/Leander of Seville |publisher=Catholic University of America Press |location=Washington, D.C |year=1969 |pages=113–114 |isbn=0-8132-0062-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HaChb7wjNDkC&amp;pg=PA113}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
That work may contain only one-fifth of the original Greek text.&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, p. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the period 867-872 [[Saint Methodius of Thessaloniki]] translated the text into [[Old Church Slavonic]], of which the original was lost in the 14th century, but several dozen copies of the ''Патерікъ'' survived.&lt;ref name="Slavonic"&gt;{{cite book |author=Veder, William |title=The Scete Patericon v1-3 |publisher=Pegasus |location=Amsterdam |year=2012 |isbn=9789061433323 |url=https://www.pegasusboek.nl/poes-12-the-scete-paterikon.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, the Dutch [[Jesuit]] [[Heribert Rosweyde]] compiled and translated all the available sources on the Desert Fathers and published them in Latin as the ''[[Vitae patrum]]''.

[[Helen Waddell]] translated a selection of elements from the ''Vitae Patrum'' into English in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Waddell, ''The desert fathers'' (translations from the ''Vitae Patrum''), London: Constable &amp; co., 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; The first complete translation of the "apothegmata" into English is that of [[Benedicta Ward]] (1975).&lt;ref&gt;Benedicta Ward, ''The sayings of the Desert Fathers : the alphabetical collection'', Kalamazoo, Michigan: Cistercian Publications, 1975 (revised edition, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Atlantis'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Bridgit Mendler]]. Written by Mendler, [[After Midnight Project|Spencer Bastian]], Mischa Chillak and Kaiydo, with Bastian and Chillak serving as producers, it was released as the lead single from the [[extended play]], ''[[Nemesis (EP)|Nemesis]]'' (2016),&lt;ref name="iTunes Store - Single" /&gt; through Black Box Media Agency on August 26, 2016. The song is widely considered to be written due to Mendler's split from former boyfriend [[Shane Harper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.teen.com/2016/08/25/celebrities/celebrity-couples/bridgit-mendler-atlantis-breakup-with-boyfriend-shane-harper/|title = Bridgit Mendler Atlantis Song Shane Harper Split|last1 = Cubria|first1 =Kaitlin|access-date =September 28, 2016|date = August 25, 2016|work =[[Teen.com|Teen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Mendler, the song discusses the capability of finding love, but feeling like it has disappeared like a lost city, therefore referencing the mythical city of [[Atlantis]]. The track was considered by music critics to be a radical departure from her [[Hello My Name Is...|previous work]], which featured mainstream, pop music elements. Receiving critical acclaim, critics praised the atmosphere of the song and Mendler's tube distortion voice.

==Background==
Along with a series of Twitter posts on her official account teasing the release of Atlantis, Mendler shared the following information concerning the song's production:{{bquote|"So here's how Atlantis came about. I was working with Book, one of my producers, one day at his studio in [[Los Angeles]]. He started this beat that sounded like it was underwater. I imagined fish swimming through a deserted underwater city. Very triggering sonics, Book! I wrote the melody and then as Book and I started fitting the melody into the track, I wrote some rough lyrics. Honestly, we didn't have very high expectations of the song that day. About a month later, Book brought it up in a session we were doing with Spencer, my other producer. He wanted to work on it because he believed in it, and once Spencer and Book added some elements to the track and I tweaked some lyrics, the song came alive! After that it stood out to everyone as a favorite and I'm so excited for it to be the first song we share with you"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bridgit Mendler on Twitter:"i'll be sharing some stories about #Atlantis all week, here is the first one!"|url=https://twitter.com/bridgitmendler/status/767807704509190144|website=[[Twitter]]|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Composition==
"Atlantis" is mainly an [[Indie pop|alt pop]], [[electronica]]&lt;ref name="Idolator" /&gt; and [[trip hop]] song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://popcrush.com/bridgit-mendler-nemesis-ep-exclusive-interview/|title = Bridgit Mendler Opens Up About Her 'Nemesis' EP: Exclusive|author = Erica Russell|access-date=December 4, 2016|date=November 17, 2016|work =[[PopCrush]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; About it, Mendler stated "I wrote 'Atlantis' frankly about feeling numb after heartbreak because that's what I was feeling that day we wrote it. Atlantis is a beautiful city that disappeared and was forgotten underwater. That is what it feels like to me to lose a first love. In the story, a remnant of that love is still haunting me even though it is 'asleep with the fishes.'"&lt;ref name="MTV" /&gt; She also said to [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] that "'Atlantis' is about knowing that I am capable of finding love, but feeling like it has disappeared like a lost city. I wanted to set a haunting tone to the lyrics because the song captures a very tumultuous and transformative time in my life. This song really takes ownership of that."&lt;ref name="Idolator"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.idolator.com/7644215/bridgit-mendler-atlantis-kaiydo-full-song|title = Bridgit Mendler Returns With 'Atlantis' - Idolator|last1 = Wass|first1 = Mike|access-date=August 26, 2016|date =August 25, 2016|work=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On having Kaiydo rap in the song, Mendler said "I felt the song would be a good one to have a rapper counterpart to add a different perspective. Kaiydo met the tone of the song perfectly."&lt;ref name="Pigeons and Planes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pigeonsandplanes.com/music/2016/08/bridgit-mendler-atlantis|title=Bridgit Mendler Enlists Kaiydo For Immersive New Single 'Atlantis' - Pigeons And Planes|last1=Moore|first1=Jacob|access-date=August 26, 2016|date=August 25, 2016|work=[[Pigeons and Planes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
"Atlantis" received unanimous praise. Deepa Lakshmin of ''[[MTV]]'' labeled the song "a mellow ode to a past lover" and said that it's "a radical departure from Mendler's previous record", and went on to say that the song is "cool, refreshing, and totally different."&lt;ref name="MTV"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mtv.com/news/2923620/bridgit-mendler-atlantis-song/|title = Bridgit Mendler's New Song Is So Not Disney Channel - MTV|last1 = Lakshmin|first1 = Deepa|access-date = August 26, 2016|date = August 25, 2016|work = [[MTV News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pigeons and Planes]]' Jacob Moore claimed "[Atlantis] is a departure from the saccharine flavor of previous singles like '[[Ready or Not (Bridgit Mendler song)|Ready or Not]]', an international hit that went platinum in several countries. 'Atlantis' is more complex, a little more difficult to process, but ultimately much more rewarding. It's an immersive piece of modern pop music that feels like something between drowning and floating, or maybe like a little of both."&lt;ref name="Pigeons and Planes" /&gt; Rachel Sonis of [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] called the song a "wistful anthem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.idolator.com/7646854/bridgit-mendler-atlantis-video|title = Bridgit Mendler Wreaks Havoc In Her 'Atlantis' Video: Watch - Idolator|last1 = Sonis|first1 = Rachel|access-date = September 28, 2016|date = September 27, 2016|work = [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Noisey]]''{{'}}s Phil Witmer stated "Mendler's voice is run through tube distortion, chopped up into pinpricks, and becomes a gorgeously vocoded choir on the cavernous hook. It's something like [[Imogen Heap]] meeting early [[Purity Ring (band)|Purity Ring]], and the guest verse from Florida underground rapper Kaiydo makes 'Atlantis' a masterwork in craft and atmosphere."&lt;ref name="Noisey" /&gt; ''Burning Anchor''{{'}}s Angus McColl gave "Atlantis" a 5/5 star rating stating: "Overall, "Atlantis" feels like a natural departure and radical improvement from 2012's ''[[Hello My Name Is...]]'' Mendler creates a soothing, intelligent, mature song which will make you yearn for more."&lt;ref name="ba456"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://burninganchor.wordpress.com/2016/10/09/bridgit-mendler-atlantis-review/ | title=Bridgit Mendler – "Atlantis" Review | publisher=''Burning Anchor'' | date=9 October 2016 | accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A music video for the song was released on September 27, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK8VoVqLXeY|title = Bridgit Mendler - Atlantis feat. Kaiydo [Official Video] - YouTube|access-date = September 28, 2016|date = September 27, 2016|work = [[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samantha Boscarino]], who co-starred with Mendler on ''[[The Clique (film)|The Clique]]'' and ''[[Good Luck Charlie]]'', is featured in the music video.

===Background===
In an interview with ''[[Noisey]]'', Mendler said "we went through a ton of ideas and when I first got Allie's treatment, her fresh perspective was undeniable. I told her I had my heart set on working with her and from there we found a concept that had dark, satirical, plus heart-aching moments. I break into my ex's house and try to recreate our lost love while he is passed out. Even in the midst of fun and light moments in life, my heart is as limp as his hand hitting my knee while we dance in the kitchen."&lt;ref name="Noisey"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mendler|first1=Bridgit|url = https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/ready-or-not-bridgit-mendler-is-back-with-a-new-song-atlantis-thats-better-than-anything-youll-hear-today|title = Ready or Not, Bridgit Mendler Is Back with a Video for 'Atlantis' That's Better Than Anything You'll Hear Today - Noisey|last2 = Witmer|first2 = Phil|access-date = September 28, 2016|date = September 27, 2016|work = [[Noisey]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
Phil Witmer of ''Noisey'' stated "the video fits the song's ambiguity and beguiling nature, with Mendler and her friends literally attempting to resuscitate a past relationship in dreamy vignettes that veer between celebratory and somber."&lt;ref name="Noisey" /&gt;

'''August Landmesser''' (born 24 May 1910;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eckler |first=Irene |date=1996 |title=Die Vormundschaftsakte 1935-1958: Verfolgung einer Familie wegen "Rassenschande": Dokumente und Berichte aus Hamburg |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xOK7AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=+24+May+1910 |location= |publisher=[[Horneburg]] |isbn= |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Killed in action|KIA]] 17 October 1944; confirmed in 1949) was a worker at the [[Blohm+Voss]] shipyard in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]], best known for his appearance, according to the disputed claim of his daughter, in a photograph&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fasena.de/courage/ |title=Verbotene Liebe &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; Courage |first1=Amanda |last1=Straße |date= |website=Fasena.de |publisher=[[1&amp;1 Internet]] |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; refusing to perform the [[Nazi salute]] at the launch of the [[Kriegsmarine|naval]] training vessel ''[[Horst Wessel (ship)|Horst Wessel]]'' on 13 June 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Simone Erpel: Zivilcourage : Schlüsselbild einer unvollendeten „Volksgemeinschaft". In: Gerhard Paul (Hrsg.): Das Jahrhundert der Bilder, Bd. 1: 1900–1949, Göttingen 2009, pp. 490–497, {{ISBN|978-3-89331-949-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He had run afoul of the [[Nazi Party]] over his unlawful relationship with Irma Eckler, a Jewish woman. He was later imprisoned and eventually drafted into penal military service, where he was killed in action; Eckler was sent to a [[concentration camp]] where it is presumed she was killed.

==Biography==
August Landmesser was the only child of August Franz Landmesser and Wilhelmine Magdalene (née Schmidtpott). In 1931, hoping it would help him get a job, he joined the [[Nazi Party]]. In 1935, when he became engaged to Irma Eckler (a [[German Jews|Jewish]] woman), he was expelled from the party.&lt;ref name="Roux"&gt;{{cite book |last=Roux |first=François |date= 2013-06-06|title=Comprendre Hitler et les allemands |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YZDlPnzTWU4C&amp;pg=PT24&amp;q=%22august%20landmesser%22 |location=[[Paris, France]] |publisher=''[[Éditions Max Milo]]'' |isbn=9782315004614 |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They registered to be married in Hamburg, but the [[Nuremberg Laws]] enacted a month later prevented it. On 29 October 1935, Landmesser and Eckler's first daughter, Ingrid, was born.&lt;ref name="Roux"/&gt;

A now-famous photograph, in which a man identified as Landmesser refuses to give the Nazi salute, was taken on 13 June 1936.&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite news |last=Flock |first=Elizabeth |date=7 February 2012 |title=August Landmesser, shipyard worker in Hamburg, refused to perform Nazi salute (photo) |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/august-landmesser-shipyard-worker-in-hamburg-refused-to-perform-nazi-salute-photo/2012/02/07/gIQA1ZzExQ_blog.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |publisher=[[Katharine Weymouth|Washington Post Media]] |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, Landmesser and Eckler tried to flee to Denmark but were apprehended. She was again pregnant, and he was charged and found guilty in July 1937 of "[[Rassenschande|dishonoring the race]]" under Nazi racial laws. He argued that neither he nor Eckler knew that she was fully Jewish, and was acquitted on 27 May 1938 for lack of evidence, with the warning that a repeat offense would result in a multi-year prison sentence. The couple publicly continued their relationship, and on 15 July 1938 he was arrested again and sentenced to two and a half years in the [[Börgermoor]] [[concentration camp]].

Eckler was detained by the [[Gestapo]] and held at the prison [[Fuhlsbüttel]], where she gave birth to a second daughter, Irene.&lt;ref name="Post"/&gt; From there she was sent to the [[Oranienburg concentration camp]], the [[Lichtenburg concentration camp]] for women, and then the women's concentration camp at [[Ravensbrück]]. A few letters came from Irma Eckler until January 1942. It is believed that she was taken to the [[Bernburg Euthanasia Centre]] in February 1942, where she was among the 14,000 killed; in the course of post-war documentation, in 1949 she was pronounced legally dead, with a date of 28 April 1942.

Meanwhile, Landmesser was discharged from prison on 19 January 1941.&lt;ref name="Roux"/&gt; He worked as a foreman for the [[haulage]] company Püst. The company had a branch at the Heinkel-Werke (factory) in [[Warnemünde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fasena.de/courage/english/10.htm |title=Father reported missing |first1=Amanda |last1=Straße |date= |website=Fasena.de |publisher=[[1&amp;1 Internet]] |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1944 he was drafted into a [[Strafbattalion|penal battalion]], the [[999th Light Afrika Division (Wehrmacht)|999th Fort Infantry Battalion]]. He was declared [[killed in action]], after being killed during fighting in [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] on 17 October 1944.&lt;ref name="Bartrop"&gt;{{cite book | title=Resisting the Holocaust: Upstanders, Partisans, and Survivors | last=Bartrop | first=Paul R. | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CXgiDAAAQBAJ | year=2016 | page=152 | publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] | location=| isbn=9781610698795 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Eckler, he was legally declared dead in 1949.&lt;ref name="Bartrop"/&gt;

Their children were initially taken to the city orphanage. Ingrid was later allowed to live with her maternal grandmother while Irene went to the home of foster parents in 1941. Ingrid was also placed with foster parents after her grandmother's death in 1953.

The marriage of August Landmesser and Irma Eckler was recognized retroactively by the [[Senate of Hamburg]] in the summer of 1951, and in the autumn of that year Ingrid assumed the surname ''Landmesser''. Irene continued to use the surname ''Eckler''.

==Recognition==
In 1996, Irene Eckler published the book ''Die Vormundschaftsakte 1935–1958: Verfolgung einer Familie wegen "Rassenschande"'' (''The Guardianship Documents 1935–1958: Persecution of a Family for "Racial Disgrace"''). The book tells the story of her family, and includes a large number of original documents from the time in question, including letters from her mother and documents from state institutions.&lt;ref name="Post"/&gt;

A figure identified by Irene Eckler as August Landmesser is featured in a photograph taken on 13 June 1936, published on 22 March 1991 in ''[[Die Zeit]]''. It shows a large gathering of workers at the Blohm+Voss shipyard in Hamburg, for the launching of the navy training ship ''Horst Wessel''.  Almost everyone in the image has raised his arm in the Nazi salute, with the most obvious exception of a man toward the back of the crowd, who grimly stands with his arms crossed over his chest. Several others have also refrained from saluting, but are not so obviously defiant.

Whether the depicted man is Landmesser is not known with certainty. Another family claims the person in the photo is another metalworker at Blohm &amp; Voss, a man called Gustav Wegert.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Paul, Das Jahrhundert der Bilder 1900 bis 1949, Verlag Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht 2009, Seite 494 rechte Spalte Absatz 3), as quoted in [http://wegert-familie.de/home/English.html]. Quote: „In the meantime another Family from Hamburg has identified the man as a relative. It should be Gustav Wegert (1890-1959) who worked as a metalworker at Blohm &amp; Voss. As a believing Christian he generally refused the Nazi Salute. Despite his distance to the Nazi Regime Gustav Wegert did not get in the eye of the Nazi persecution administration. Portraits from Wegert and Landmesser prove in both cases great similarity with the worker on that picture. At this time it has to remain unsettled who the man in the picture is“.&lt;/ref&gt; The content and photos posted by relatives of Wegert&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wegert-familie.de/home/English.html|title=1936 - Just one refused the Nazi salute|website=wegert-familie.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recent photographic enhancements make it more likely that the person in the photo refusing to perform the Nazi salute was Gustav Wegert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strangehistory.net/2014/10/26/german-non-saluter-myth/|title=The German Non-Saluter Myth - Beachcombing's Bizarre History Blog|date=26 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=January 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3426">'''Aída Bortnik''' (7 January 1938 – 27 April 2013) was an [[Demographics of Argentina|Argentine]] [[screenwriter]], nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for her work in the film ''[[The Official Story|La historia oficial]]'' (1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minutouno.com/notas/285650-murio-la-prestigiosa-guionista-argentina-aida-bortnik|title=Murió la prestigiosa guionista argentina Aída Bortnik|publisher=minutouno.com|accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has the notable distinction of having written the screenplay for both the first Argentine film nominated for an Academy Award (''[[The Truce (1974 film)|The Truce]]'', 1974) and the first Argentine film to win an Academy Award (''La historia oficial'').

==Career==
After starting out as a TV-screenwriter in 1971, Bortnik co-wrote with débutant director [[Sergio Renán]] the screenplay for ''The Truce'' (1974), based on the eponymous novel by [[Mario Benedetti]]. It was the first Argentine film to be nominated for an Academy Award (the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film) in 1975, but lost out to [[Federico Fellini]]'s
''[[Amarcord]]''. That year, Bortnik co-wrote ''Una mujer'', directed by Juan José Stagnaro. After a three-year break, Bortnik worked one more time with Renán in writing a screenplay in 1977 for Haroldo Conti's novel, ''Crecer de golpe''. She then co-wrote ''La isla'' (1979) with director [[Alejandro Doria]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In 1985, Bortnik co-wrote with writer-director [[Luis Puenzo]] a screenplay for a film about the Argentine [[Dirty War]], which had recently ceased. The film denounced the atrocities of the military regime and made the brutal dictatorships known worldwide. The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] in 1986, and earned Bortnik a nomination for ''Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen'', shared with Puenzo. That same year, she co-wrote ''Pobre mariposa'' with director [[Raúl de la Torre]]. In  1989, Bortnik helped Puenzo write the screenplay for [[Carlos Fuentes]]' novel ''[[Old Gringo]]'', a [[United States]] production; the only non-Argentine project in which Bortnik was involved. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

During the 90s, Bortnik worked strictly with newcomer writer/director [[Marcelo Piñeyro]], who had served as executive produced to ''{{lang|es|La historia oficial}}''. Bortnik helped Piñeyro write the screenplays for ''[[Tango feroz: la leyenda de Tanguito]]'' (1993), ''[[Caballos salvajes]]'' (1995) and ''[[Cenizas del Paraíso]]'' (1997), a loose trilogy. She renewed her working relationship with Sergio Renán, co-writing ''{{lang|es|La soledad era esto}}'' (2002). Her last work was as an occasional writer for the series ''{{lang|es|Vientos de agua}}'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ambito.com/diario/noticia.asp?id=685912|title=A los 75 años murió Aída Bortnik|publisher=Ambito Financiero|accessdate=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bessie''''' is an [[HBO]] [[television film|TV film]] about legendary American [[blues]] [[singer]] [[Bessie Smith]], and focuses on her transformation as a struggling young singer into "The Empress of the Blues". The film is directed by [[Dee Rees]], with a screenplay by Rees, Christopher Cleveland and [[Bettina Gilois]]. [[Queen Latifah]] stars as Smith, and supporting roles are played by [[Michael K. Williams|Michael Kenneth Williams]] as Smith's first husband Jack Gee, and [[Mo'Nique]] as  [[Ma Rainey]]. The film premiered on May 16, 2015.&lt;ref name="BB-biopic"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6480466/queen-latifah-bessie-smith-film-hbo-premiere-date | title=Queen Latifah's Bessie Smith Film to Premiere May 16 on HBO | work=Billboard | date=24 February 2015 | accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the following year ''Bessie'' stood as the most watched HBO original film of all time. The film was well received critically and garnered four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie|Outstanding Television Movie]].

==Synopsis==
Bessie Smith (Queen Latifah) is a young singer from [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. She and her siblings are orphaned when their parents, William and Laura, die, leaving their oldest sister, Viola (Khandi Alexander), to raise them. Viola is stern and Bessie's childhood is unhappy. She along with her brother Clarence (Tory Kittles) scrape by working for local vaudeville shows. Her stage ambitions are frustrated by producers unwilling to feature dark-skinned black women in their shows. Bessie sneaks onto traveling performer [[Ma Rainey]]'s (Mo'Nique) train compartment and asks to join her show. Ma Rainey takes Bessie under her wing and helps her develop her abilities until Bessie's popularity causes a schism between the two women. Bessie leaves with Clarence to start her own show.

In addition to her lover Lucille (Tika Sumpter), Bessie begins a tumultuous relationship with Jack Gee (Michael K. Williams), a security guard who later becomes her husband and manager. After a humiliating rejection from the newly formed [[Black Swan Records]], Jack manages to get Bessie a record deal with [[Columbia Records]]. Immense success follows, though Bessie encounters difficulties, including a stabbing attack after a show in her hometown, racism from white guests during an affluent party, and an attack during her show by the [[Ku Klux Klan]], whom she courageously chases off. Eventually, Bessie reconciles with Viola, and moves her and all of her siblings into a mansion to live with her. The move causes additional tension with Jack, and Bessie pushes him further by adopting a young boy, whom she names Jack Jr., as their son. Eventually, Lucille leaves Bessie in order to have her own life. Despite her own affair with [[Rum-running|bootlegger]] Richard Morgan (Mike Epps), Bessie is infuriated upon discovering that Jack is bankrolling his mistress, up and coming performer Gertrude Saunders. After a violent quarrel, Jack leaves her. Bessie spirals into depression and alcohol. Jack returns, kidnapping Jack Jr. with the assistance of Viola, and takes him to live with him, contending that Bessie is an unfit mother.

During the [[Great Depression]], Bessie's fortune dissolves, and she and Clarence move into a small apartment. Bessie reconciles with Ma Rainey and takes some time to recuperate from her personal losses. Eventually, she accepts Richard's love for her and the two begin a relationship. After hearing [[Lucille Bogan]]'s licentious hit song "Til the Cows Come Home", Bessie performs once again and meets a young [[John Hammond (producer)|John Hammond]] who wishes to produce her comeback tour. Bessie's comeback is a success and she later reflects on her life while discussing the future with Richard.

==Production==

A first draft screenplay was written by playwright [[Horton Foote]] at a time when Columbia Pictures was slated to produce the film, but the project died when the studio became involved in a financial irregularity that threatened its existence. Mr. Foote purchased his screenplay back from Columbia and acquired the film rights from biographer Chris Albertson.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} In the early 1990s, when the possibility of producers [[Richard D. Zanuck]] and Lili Fini Zanuck taking over the project arose, Albertson suggested Queen Latifah for the lead, but the project lay dormant when  financing could not be found. Upon Horton Foote's death in 2009, the script and film rights became the property of his daughter, actress [[Hallie Foote]], who took it to the Zanucks and HBO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/understanding-screenwriting-130/|title=Understanding Screenwriting #130|last=Stempel|first=Tom|date=July 15, 2015|publisher=Creative Screenwriting|accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, press releases claim that ''Bessie'' has been "22 years in the making." As part of the HBO deal, Queen Latifah is credited as one of the executive producers. The project was filmed in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].&lt;ref name="TVbytheNumbers"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/01/08/bessie-starring-queen-latifah-to-premiere-this-spring-on-hbo/348055/ | title='Bessie' Starring Queen Latifah to Premiere this Spring on HBO | work=TV by the Numbers | date=January 8, 2015 | accessdate=May 24, 2015 | author=Bibel, Sara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early article announcing the HBO film indicated it would be based on ''Bessie'', a 1972 biography by [[Chris Albertson]],&lt;ref name="HR-biopic"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/queen-latifah-star-as-bessie-700543 | title=Queen Latifah to Star as Bessie Smith in HBO Biopic | work=Hollywood Reporter | date=1 May 2014 | accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a year later the book was not included in the film's credits or promotion, nor did the end result bear but a peripheral resemblance to Albertson's book.

{{Refimprove|date=July 2013}}
"'''Big Rock Candy Mountain'''", first recorded by [[Harry McClintock]] in 1928, is a [[American folk music|folk]] song about a [[hobo]]'s idea of [[paradise]], a modern version of the [[medieval]] concept of [[Cockaigne]].  It is a place where "hens lay [[Soft-boiled egg|soft boiled eggs]]" and there are "[[cigarette]] trees."  McClintock claimed to have written the song in 1895, based on tales from his youth hoboing through the [[United States]], but some believe that at least aspects of the song have existed for far longer. It is catalogued as [[Roud Folk Song Index]] No. 6696.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vwml.org/search?qtext=6696 |website=Vaughan Williams Memorial Library |title=Roud Folksong Index No. 6696 |accessdate=September 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The song was first recorded by McClintock, also known by his "hobo" name of Haywire Mac.  McClintock claimed credit for writing the song, though it was likely partially based on other ballads, including "[[An Invitation to Lubberland]]" and "The Appleknocker's Lament".  Other popular itinerant songs of the day such as "Hobo's Paradise", "Hobo Heaven", "Sweet Potato Mountains" and "Little Streams of Whiskey" likely served as inspiration, as they mention concepts similar to those in "Big Rock Candy Mountain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nowhere in America: the Big Rock Candy Mountain and Other Comic Utopias |last=Rammel |first=Hal |year= 1990|publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UD26WT4XVUsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22big+rock+candy+mountain%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before recording the song, McClintock cleaned it up considerably from the version he sang as a street [[busking|busker]] in the 1890s. Originally the song described a child being recruited into hobo life by tales of the "big rock candy mountain". In later years, when McClintock appeared in court as part of a copyright dispute, he cited the original words of the song, the last stanza of which was:

:''The punk rolled up his big blue eyes''
:''And said to the jocker, "Sandy,''
:''I've hiked and hiked and wandered too,''
:''But I ain't seen any candy.''
:''I've hiked and hiked till my feet are sore''
:''And I'll be damned if I hike any more''
:''To be buggered sore like a hobo's whore''
:''In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.''"

In the released version this verse did not appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Harry Partch, Hobo Composer |last=Granade |first=S Andrew |year= 2014|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer |isbn= |page= |pages=205 |url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=ktEwBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=%22big+rock+candy+mountain%22+sore+buggered&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0soqvs7rNAhXBPRoKHcqaAuoQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22big%20rock%20candy%20mountain%22%20sore%20whore&amp;f=false |accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was not popularized until 1939, when it peaked at #1 on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine's]] country music charts.  But it achieved more widespread popularity in 1949 when a sanitized version intended for children was re-recorded by [[Burl Ives]].  It has been recorded by many artists throughout the world, but a version recorded in 1960 by [[Dorsey Burnette]] to date was the biggest success for the song in the post-1954 "rock era", having reached No. 102 on Billboard's chart.

Sanitized versions have been popular, especially with [[children's music]]ians; in these, the "[[cigarette]] trees" become [[peppermint]] trees, and the "streams of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]" trickling down the rocks become streams of [[lemonade]]. The lake of [[gin]] is not mentioned, and the lake of [[whiskey]] becomes a lake of [[soft drink|soda pop]]. The 2008 extended adaptation for children by Gil McLachlan tells the story as a child's dream, the last stanza being:

:''In the Big Rock Candy Mountains you're going on a holiday''
:''Your birthday comes around once a week and it’s Christmas every day''
:''You never have to clean your room or put your toys away''
:''There's a little white horse you can ride of course''
:''You can jump so high you can touch the sky''
:''In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.''

==Editions==
Folklorist [[John Greenway (folklorist)|John Greenway]] published the song in his ''American Folksongs of Protest'' (1953), redacting only the second to last line. Bowdlerized versions are included in [[Irwin Silber]]'s ''Songs of the Great American West'' (1967) and [[Alan Lomax]]'s ''The Penguin Book of American Folk Songs'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Todd |last=DePastino |title=Citizen Hobo: How a Century of Homelessness Shaped America |location=Chicago / London |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2003 |isbn=9780226143781 |pages=88; 286, note 112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A folk version of the song is included in the [[Gordon "Inferno" Collection]] in the [[Library of Congress]], under the title "The Appleknocker's Lament".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sniff.numachi.com/~rickheit/dtrad/pages/tiBIGROCK3;ttBIGROCK.html |title=The Big Rock Candy Mountain (3) |publisher=Sniff.numachi.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical locations===
A cluster of brightly colored hills just north of [[Marysvale, Utah]], near the [[Fishlake National Forest]], is named the "Big Rock Candy Mountain". In 1928, after the song had been released, some Utah residents jokingly placed a sign at the base of the hills labeling it the "Big Rock Candy Mountain", along with a sign next to a nearby spring proclaiming it "Lemonade Springs".  The Big Rock Candy Mountain Resort&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Rock Candy Mountain Resort|url=http://www.candymountainresort.com/|publisher=Big Rock Candy Mountain|accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; currently sits at the base of the hills and is a major hub on the Paiute ATV trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utah.com/offroad/paiute_trail.htm |title=ATV Paiute Trail |publisher=Utah.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Christine |last=Wilkerson |url=http://geology.utah.gov/surveynotes/geosights/candymtn.htm |title=Big Rock Candy Mountain - Utah Geological Survey |publisher=Geology.utah.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other rock formations in the United States have also borrowed the name of the song; the largest exposed rock in the [[South Platte]] rock [[climbing area]] of [[Colorado]] is also called "Big Rock Candy Mountain" because of its colored stripes resembling a [[candy cane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockclimbing.com/routes/North_America/United_States/Colorado/South_Platte_Area/Big_Rock_Candy_Mountain/ |title=Rock Climbing Routes in Big Rock Candy Mountain, South Platte Area |publisher=Rockclimbing.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Hansen |url=http://www.climbingboulder.com/rock/db/south_platte/big_rock_candy_mountain/ |title=Big Rock Candy Mountain |website=Climbing Boulder.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203173539/http://www.climbingboulder.com/rock/db/south_platte/big_rock_candy_mountain/ |archivedate=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, one of the peaks in the [[Capitol State Forest]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] State is named "Big Rock Candy Mountain".

===In literature===
*In 1943, [[Wallace Stegner]] published an autobiographical novel titled ''[[The Big Rock Candy Mountain (novel)|The Big Rock Candy Mountain]]''. He published a further autobiographical work in 1992 entitled ''Where the Bluebird Sings to the Lemonade Springs'', a reference to a line in the song.
*In 1945, [[George Orwell]] referenced the song in the book ''[[Animal Farm]]'' with an animal version of [[heaven]] named [[Sugarcandy Mountain]].
* In William Kennedy's 1979 novel "Ironweed," the character Rudy sings lines from the song to his fellow bums in a flophouse.
*In [[Glen Cook]]'s 1982 novel ''Shadowline'', first in the ''Starfishers'' trilogy, a planet named the Big Rock Candy Mountain is the location for several scenes.
*The song is discussed in depth in the book ''[[The Areas of My Expertise]]'' by [[John Hodgman]], and performed by [[Jonathan Coulton]] in the audiobook.
*In [[Mur Lafferty]]'s ''Heaven'' novella series, the Big Rock Candy Mountain is portrayed as the hobo afterlife.

===In film and television===
*A 1963 [[animated cartoon]], ''Hobo's Holiday'', features the adult lyrics which appear on screen with a [[bouncing ball (music)|bouncing ball]].
*In 1987, photographer [[Robert Frank]] directed a screenplay by Rudy Wurlitzer entitled ''Candy Mountain'' that references the song.
*The 2000 film ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' uses this song in the opening credits.
*The theme song to the 2008-2010 TV series ''[[The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack]]'' is a version of the song with modified lyrics, referring to "a place called Candied Island" instead of "Big Rock Candy Mountain". The series itself echoes the song, as it features two hobo-like characters searching for the legendary Candied Island.
*During the first dream sequence in the 2011 horror film ''[[Twixt (film)|Twixt]]'', the lyrics of the song are sung with an alternate melody.
*In the 2015 film ''[[Room (2015 film)|Room]]'', Ma ([[Brie Larson]]) sings a version of the song to her son Jack ([[Jacob Tremblay]]).
*In the SyFy channel series ''[[Van Helsing (TV series)|Van Helsing]]'', Sam sings bits of the song in the episode "Little Thing" and the Burl Ives rendition is played over the closing credits of several episodes.
*A version of the song by Burl Ives is played in the season 4 episode ''[[Something_Stupid_(Better_Call_Saul)|Something Stupid]]'' of [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]'s crime drama ''[[Better Call Saul]]''.

===In music===
* In the 1970s, "Big Rock Candy Mountain" and other songs were made into an environmental fairytale, published on an LP intended for children. It is the story of a goose, a crawdad, a family of rats, a [[whangdoodle]], and two hobos who journey to the fabled mountain in search of a home.  There they find Pollution Pete, Cement Sam, and a construction crew damming the rivers, cutting down forests, and turning the mountain into suburbia.  The animals steal shovels, paint them with glow-in-the-dark paint, and use them to scare away the crew so that the mountain can be returned to its pristine state.
*In 1987, Scottish indie pop band [[The Motorcycle Boy]] released an original song with the same title as a single.
*In 1990, [[Jane Wiedlin]] recorded an unrelated song with the same title on her album ''Tangled.''
*The song "Candy Mountain Cave", from the online video ''[[Charlie the Unicorn]]'', parodies this song (to the tune of the "[[Clarinet Polka]]").
*In 1978, country singer [[Mel Tillis]] released the single "[[Ain't No California]]", which includes the line, "Ain't no Big Rock Candy Mountain."
*In 2014, folk-punk singer Jesse Stewart makes reference in his song "''Marauder''" where he asks, "Well, where? Oh where? Is the Big Rock Candy Mountain."

'''Brian O'Nolan''' ({{lang-ga|Brian Ó Nualláin}}; 5 October 1911 – 1 April 1966) was an Irish novelist, playwright and satirist, considered a major figure in twentieth century [[Irish literature]]. Born in [[Strabane]], [[County Tyrone]], he is regarded as a key figure in [[postmodern literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2011/10/flann-obrien.html |title=Celebrating Flann O'Brien |last=Kellogg |first=Carolyn |date=13 October 2011 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His English language novels, such as ''[[At Swim-Two-Birds]]'' and ''[[The Third Policeman]]'', were written under the [[pen name]] '''Flann O'Brien'''. His many satirical columns in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' and an Irish language novel ''[[An Béal Bocht]]'' were written under the name '''Myles na gCopaleen'''.

O'Nolan's novels have attracted a wide following for their bizarre humour and modernist [[metafiction]]. As a novelist, O'Nolan was influenced by [[James Joyce]]. He was nonetheless sceptical of the cult of Joyce which overshadows much of Irish writing, saying "I declare to God if I hear that name Joyce one more time I will surely froth at the gob."

==Biography==

===School days===
O'Nolan attended [[Blackrock College]] where he was taught English by President of the College, and future Archbishop, [[John Charles McQuaid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000029328 |first1=Sean |last1=Farragher |first2=Annraoi |last2=Wyer |title=Blackrock College 1860-1995 |location=Dublin |publisher=Paraclete Press |date=1995 |isbn=0946639191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Farragher and Wyer:

Dr McQuaid himself was recognised as an outstanding English teacher, and when one of his students, Brian O'Nolan, alias Myles na gCopaleen, boasted in his absence to the rest of the class that there were only two people in the College who could write English properly namely, Dr McQuaid and himself, they had no hesitation in agreeing. And Dr McQuaid did Myles the honour of publishing a little verse by him in the first issue of the revived College Annual (1930) – this being Myles' first published item.&lt;ref name=seamussweeney&gt;{{cite web |url=https://seamussweeney.wordpress.com/2016/05/01/flann-obriens-english-teacher-john-charles-mcquaid/ |title=Flann O'Brien's English Teacher: John Charles McQuaid |date=1 May 2016 |website=Séamus Sweeney Blog |accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem itself, "Ad Astra", read as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Ah! When the skies at night
Are damascened with gold,
Methinks the endless sight
Eternity unrolled.&lt;ref name=seamussweeney /&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

O'Nolan also spent part of his schooling years in [[Synge Street CBS|Synge Street Christian Brothers School]]. His novel [[The Hard Life]], is a semi autobiographical depiction of his experience of the Christian Brothers.

===Student years===
O'Nolan wrote prodigiously during his years as a student at [[University College, Dublin]] (UCD), where he was an active, and controversial, member of the well known [[Literary and Historical Society (University College Dublin)|Literary and Historical Society]]. He contributed to the student magazine ''Comhthrom Féinne'' (''Fair Play'') under various guises, in particular the pseudonym '''Brother Barnabas'''. Significantly, he composed a story during this same period titled "Scenes in a Novel (probably posthumous) by Brother Barnabas", which anticipates many of the ideas and themes later to be found in his novel, ''At Swim-Two-Birds''. In it, the putative author of the story finds himself in riotous conflict with his characters, who are determined to follow their own paths regardless of the author's design. For example, the villain of the story, one Carruthers McDaid, intended by the author as the lowest form of scoundrel, "meant to sink slowly to absolutely the last extremities of human degradation", instead ekes out a modest living selling cats to elderly ladies and becomes a covert churchgoer without the author's consent. Meanwhile, the story's hero, Shaun Svoolish, chooses a comfortable, bourgeois life rather than romance and heroics:

:'I may be a prig', he replied, 'but I know what I like. Why can't I marry Bridie and have a shot at the Civil Service?'
:'Railway accidents are fortunately rare', I said finally, 'but when they happen they are horrible. Think it over.'

In 1934 O'Nolan and his student friends founded a short-lived magazine called ''Blather''. The writing here, though clearly bearing the marks of youthful bravado, again somewhat anticipates O'Nolan's later work, in this case his ''Cruiskeen Lawn'' column as Myles na gCopaleen:

:''Blather'' is here. As we advance to make our bow, you will look in vain for signs of servility or of any evidence of a desire to please. We are an arrogant and depraved body of men. We are as proud as bantams and as vain as peacocks.

:''Blather'' doesn't care. A sardonic laugh escapes us as we bow, cruel and cynical hounds that we are. It is a terrible laugh, the laugh of lost men. Do you get the smell of porter?

O'Nolan, who had studied German in Dublin, may have spent at least parts of 1933 and 1934 in Germany, namely in Cologne and Bonn, although details are uncertain and contested. He claimed himself, in 1965, that he "spent many months in the Rhineland and at Bonn drifting away from the strict pursuit of study." So far, no external evidence has turned up that would back up this sojourn (or an also anecdotal short-term marriage to one 'Clara Ungerland' from Cologne). In their biography Costello and van de Kamp, discussing the inconclusive evidence, state that "...it must remain a mystery, in the absence of documented evidence an area of mere speculation, representing in a way the other mysteries of life of Brian O'Nolan that still defy the researcher."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Peter |last1=Costello |first2=Peter |last2=van de Kamp |title=Flann O'Brien – An Illustrated Biography |location=London, UK |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=1987 |isbn=0-7475-0129-7 |pages=45–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil service===
A key feature of O'Nolan's personal situation was his status as an Irish government civil servant, who, as a result of his father's relatively early death, was obliged to support ten siblings, including an elder brother who was an unsuccessful writer. Given the desperate poverty of Ireland in the 1930s to 1960s, a job as a civil servant was considered prestigious, being both secure and pensionable with a reliable cash income in a largely agrarian economy. The [[Civil service of the Republic of Ireland|Irish civil service]] has been, since the [[Irish Civil War]], fairly strictly apolitical: Civil Service Regulations and the service's internal culture generally prohibit Civil Servants above the level of clerical officer from publicly expressing political views. As a practical matter, this meant that writing in newspapers on current events was, during O'Nolan's career, generally prohibited without departmental permission on an article-by-article, publication-by-publication basis. This fact alone contributed to O'Nolan's use of pseudonyms, though he had started to create character-authors even in his pre-civil service writings. O'Nolan rose to be quite senior, serving a private secretary to [[Seán T. O'Kelly]] (a minister and later President of Ireland) and [[Seán McEntee]], a powerful political figure, both of whom almost certainly knew O'Nolan was na gCopaleen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title='Could Paddy Leave off from Copying Just for Five Minutes': Brian O'Nolan and Eire's Beveridge Plan |first=Steven |last=Curran |journal=Irish University Review |volume=31 |number=2 |date=2001 |pages=353–375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, that O'Nolan was Flann O'Brien and Myles na gCopaleen was an open secret, largely disregarded by his colleagues, who found his writing very entertaining; this was a function of the makeup of the civil service, which recruited leading graduates by competitive examination—it was an erudite and relatively liberal body in the Ireland of the 1930s to the 1970s. Nonetheless, had O'Nolan forced the issue, by using one of his known pseudonyms or his own name for an article that seriously upset politicians, consequences would likely have followed—hence the acute pseudonym problem in attributing his work today. He was, indeed, forced to retire from the civil service in 1953.&lt;ref name=fotoole_fantastic_oct2011&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/the-fantastic-flann-o-brien-1.611390 |title=The Fantastic Flann O'Brien |first=Fintan |last=O'Toole |date=1 October 2011 |newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] |accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A combination of his gradually deepening alcoholism and his habit of making derogatory remarks about senior politicians in his newspaper columns led to his forced retirement from the civil service in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/an-irishman-s-diary-1.763600 |title=An Irishman's Diary |first=Frank |last=McNally |date=14 May 2009 |newspaper=The Irish Times |accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (He departed, recalled a colleague, "in a final fanfare of f***s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Phelan |title=A Watcher in the Wings: A Lingering Look at Myles na gCopaleen |journal=Administration |location=Dublin |publisher=[[Institute of Public Administration of Ireland]] |volume=24 |number=2 |date=1976 |pages=96–106 |issn=0001-8325}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Personal life===
Although O'Nolan was a well known character in Dublin during his lifetime, relatively little is known about his personal life. He joined the Irish civil service in 1935, working in the Department of Local Government. From the time of his father's death in 1937, he supported his brothers and sisters, eleven in total, on his income.&lt;ref name=monuallain_brother_oct2011/&gt; On 2 December 1948 he married Evelyn McDonnell, a typist in the Department of Local Government. On his marriage he moved from his parental home in Blackrock to nearby Merrion Avenue, living at several further locations in [[South Dublin]] before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/o/OBrien_F/life.htm |title=Flann O'Brien (1911-66) |website=Ricorso |accessdate=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had no children.

===Health and death===
[[File:065 flann obrien grab.jpg|thumb|Grave of Brian O'Nolan/Brian Ó Nualláin, his parents and his wife, [[Deans Grange Cemetery]], Dublin]]
O'Nolan was an alcoholic for much of his life and suffered from ill health in his later years.&lt;ref name="Gale1996"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Gale |editor-first=Steven H. |title=O'Nolan, Brian |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of British Humorists: Geoffrey Chaucer to John Cleese |volume=Vol.2 (L-W) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5cSkSB13ZQcC&amp;pg=PA798&amp;lpg=PA798&amp;dq=brian+o'nolan+evelyn+1966#PPA799,M1 |date=1996 |publisher=[[Garland Publishing|Garland]] |location=New York/London |isbn=978-0-8240-5990-3 |page=798 |accessdate=13 October 2009 |via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered from cancer of the throat and died from a heart attack on the morning of 1 April 1966.&lt;ref name=monuallain_brother_oct2011&gt;{{cite news |first=Micheál |last=Ó Nualláin |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1001/1224305062293.html |title=The Brother: memories of Brian |newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] |publisher=Irish Times Trust |date=1 October 2011 |accessdate=1 October 2011 |quote=In 1966 Brian was undergoing X-ray treatment for throat cancer.

==Journalism==
As Myles na gCopaleen (or Myles na Gopaleen), O'Nolan wrote short columns for ''[[The Irish Times]]'', mostly in English but also in Irish, which showed a manic imagination that still astonishes.

His newspaper column, "Cruiskeen Lawn" (transliterated from the Irish ''crúiscín lán'', "full/brimming small-jug"), has its origins in a series of pseudonymous letters written to ''[[The Irish Times]]'', originally intended to mock the publication in that same newspaper of a poem, "Spraying the Potatoes", by the writer [[Patrick Kavanagh]]:

{{cquote|I am no judge of poetry — the only poem I ever wrote was produced when I was body and soul in the gilded harness of Dame Laudanum — but I think Mr Kavanaugh [sic] is on the right track here. Perhaps the ''Irish Times'', timeless champion of our peasantry, will oblige us with a series in this strain covering such rural complexities as inflamed goat-udders, warble-pocked shorthorn, contagious abortion, non-ovoid oviducts and nervous disorders among the gentlemen who pay the rent.}}

The letters, some written by O'Nolan and some not, continued under a variety of false names, using various styles and assaulting varied topics, including other letters by the same authors. The letters were a hit with the readers of ''The Irish Times'', and [[R. M. Smyllie]], then editor of the newspaper, shortly invited O'Nolan to contribute a column. Importantly, the Irish Times maintained that there were in fact three pseudonymous authors of the Cruiskeen Lawn column, which provided a certain amount of cover for O'Nolan as a civil servant when a column was particularly provocative.

The first column appeared on 4 October 1940, under the pseudonym "An Broc" ("The Badger"). In all subsequent columns the name "Myles na gCopaleen" ("Myles of the Little Horses" or "Myles of the Ponies" - a name taken from The Collegians, a novel by [[Gerald Griffin]]) was used. Initially, the column was composed in Irish, but soon English was used primarily, with occasional smatterings of German, French or Latin. The sometimes intensely satirical column's targets included the Dublin literary elite, Irish language revivalists, the Irish government, and the "Plain People of Ireland." The following column excerpt, in which the author wistfully recalls a brief sojourn in Germany as a student, illustrates the biting humor and scorn that informed the ''Cruiskeen Lawn'' writings:

{{cquote|I notice these days that the Green Isle is getting greener. Delightful ulcerations resembling buds pit the branches of our trees, clumpy daffodils can be seen on the upland lawn. Spring is coming and every decent girl is thinking of that new Spring costume. Time will run on smoother till Favonius re-inspire the frozen Meade and clothe in fresh attire the lily and rose that have not sown nor spun. Curse it, my mind races back to my Heidelberg days. Sonya and Lili. And Magda. And Ernst Schmutz, Georg Geier, Theodor Winkleman, [[Efrem Zimbalist]], Otto Grün. And the accordion player Kurt Schachmann. And Doktor Oreille, descendant of Irish princes. Ich hab' mein Herz/ in Heidelberg verloren/ in einer lauen/ Sommernacht/ Ich war verliebt/ bis über beide/ Ohren/ und wie ein Röslein/hatt'/ Ihr Mund gelächt or something humpty tumpty tumpty tumpty tumpty mein Herz it schlägt am Neckarstrand. A very beautiful student melody. Beer and music and midnight swims in the Neckar. Chats in erse with [[Kuno Meyer|Kun O'Meyer]] and John Marquess ... Alas, those chimes. Und als wir nahmen/ Abschied vor den Toren/ beim letzten Küss, da hab' Ich Klar erkannt/ dass Ich mein Herz/ in Heidelberg verloren/ MEIN HERZ/ es schlägt am Neck-ar-strand! Tumpty tumpty tum.

:''The Plain People of Ireland:'' Isn't the German very like the Irish? Very guttural and so on?

:''Myself:'' Yes.

:''The Plain People of Ireland:'' People say that the German language and the Irish language is very guttural tongues.

:''Myself:'' Yes.

:''The Plain People of Ireland:'' The sounds is all guttural do you understand.

:''Myself.'' Yes.

:''The Plain People of Ireland:'' Very guttural languages the pair of them the Gaelic and the German.}}

Ó Nuallain/na gCopaleen wrote ''Cruiskeen Lawn'' for ''The Irish Times'' until the year of his death, 1966.

He contributed substantially to ''[[Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art|Envoy]]'' (he was "honorary editor" for the special number featuring James Joyce&lt;ref&gt;'In 1951, whilst I was editor of the Irish literary periodical Envoy, I decided that it would be a fitting thing to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the death of James Joyce by bringing out a special number dedicated to him which would reflect the attitudes and opinions of his fellow countrymen towards their illustrious compatriot. To this end I began by inviting Brian Nolan to act as honorary editor for this particular issue. His own genius closely matched, without in any way resembling or attempting to counterfeit, Joyce's. But if the mantle of Joyce (or should we say the waistcoat?) were ever to be passed on, nobody would be half so deserving of it as the man whom under his other guises as Flan [sic] O'Brien and Myles Na gCopaleen, proved himself incontestably to be the most creative writer and mordant wit that Ireland had given us since Shem the Penman himself.' – [[John Ryan (Dublin artist)|John Ryan]], Introduction to ''A Bash in the Tunnel'' (1970) [http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/r/Ryan_J2/life.htm John Ryan (1925–92) Ricorso]&lt;/ref&gt;) and formed part of the ''Envoy'' / McDaid's pub circle of artistic and literary figures that included [[Patrick Kavanagh]], [[Anthony Cronin]], [[Brendan Behan]], [[John Jordan (poet)|John Jordan]], [[Pearse Hutchinson]], [[J.P. Donleavy]] and artist [[Desmond MacNamara]] who, at the author's request, created the book cover for the first edition of ''The Dalkey Archive''. O'Nolan also contributed to ''[[The Bell (magazine)|The Bell]]''. He also wrote a column titled ''Bones of Contention'' for the ''[[Nationalist and Leinster Times]]'' under the pseudonym George Knowall; those were collected in the volume ''Myles Away From Dublin''.

Most of his later writings were occasional pieces published in periodicals, which explains why his work has only recently come to enjoy the considered attention of literary scholars. O'Nolan was notorious for his prolific use and creation of pseudonyms for much of his writing, including short stories, essays, and letters to editors, which has rendered the compilation of a complete bibliography of his writings an almost impossible task. He allegedly would write letters to the editor of ''The Irish Times'' complaining about his own articles published in that newspaper, for example in his regular ''Cruiskeen Lawn'' column, or irate, eccentric and even mildly deranged pseudonymous responses to his own pseudonymous letters, which gave rise to rampant speculation as to whether the author of a published letter existed or not. Not surprisingly, little of O'Nolan's pseudonymous activity has been verified.

==Etymology==
O'Nolan's journalistic pseudonym is taken from a character (Myles-na-Coppaleen) in [[Dion Boucicault]]'s play ''[[The Colleen Bawn]]'' (itself an adaptation of Gerald Griffin's ''The Collegians''), who is the stereotypical charming Irish rogue. At one point in the play, he sings the ancient anthem of the Irish Brigades on the Continent, the song "An Crúiscín Lán" (hence the name of the column in the ''Irish Times'').

''Capall'' is the Irish word for "horse" (from [[Vulgar Latin]] ''caballus''), and 'een' (spelled ''ín'' in Irish) is a diminutive suffix. The prefix ''na gCapaillín'' is the genitive plural in his [[Ulster Irish]] dialect (the Standard Irish would be "Myles na gCapaillíní"), so Myles na gCopaleen means "Myles of the Little Horses". ''Capaillín'' is also the Irish word for "[[pony]]", as in the name of Ireland's most famous and ancient native horse breed, the [[Connemara pony]].

O'Nolan himself always insisted on the translation "Myles of the Ponies", saying that he did not see why the principality of the pony should be subjugated to the imperialism of the horse.

==Fiction==

===''At Swim-Two-Birds''===
{{main|At Swim-Two-Birds}}
''At Swim-Two-Birds'' works entirely with borrowed (and stolen) characters from other fiction and legend, on the grounds that there are already far too many existing fictional characters.

''At Swim-Two-Birds'' is now recognised as one of the most significant [[modernist novel]]s before 1945. Indeed it can be seen as a pioneer of [[postmodernism]], although the academic [[Keith Hopper]] has argued that ''The Third Policeman'', superficially less radical, is actually a more deeply subversive and proto-postmodernist work, and as such, possibly a representation of [[literary nonsense]].

''At Swim-Two-Birds'' was one of the last books that [[James Joyce]] read and he praised it to O'Nolan's friends—praise which was subsequently used for years as a blurb on reprints of O'Brien's novels. The book was also praised by [[Graham Greene]], who was working as a reader when the book was put forward for publication and also the Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]], whose work might be said to bear some similarities to that of O'Brien.

The British writer [[Anthony Burgess]] stated, "If we don't cherish the work of Flann O'Brien we are stupid fools who don't deserve to have great men. Flann O'Brien is a very great man." Burgess included ''At Swim-Two-Birds'' on his list of ''[[Ninety-nine Novels|Ninety-Nine Novels: The Best in English since 1939]]''.

''At Swim-Two-Birds'' has had a troubled publication history in the USA. [[Southern Illinois University Press]] has set up a Flann O'Brien Center and begun publishing all of O'Nolan's works. Consequently, academic attention to the novel has increased.

===''The Third Policeman'' and ''The Dalkey Archive''===
{{main|The Third Policeman|The Dalkey Archive}}
The rejection of ''The Third Policeman'' by publishers in his lifetime had a profound effect on O'Nolan. This is perhaps reflected in ''The Dalkey Archive'', in which sections of ''The Third Policeman'' are recycled almost word for word, namely the atomic theory and the character [[De Selby]].

''The Third Policeman'' has a fantastic plot of a murderous protagonist let loose on a strange world peopled by fat policemen, played against a satire of academic debate on an eccentric philosopher called De Selby. Sergeant Pluck introduces the atomic theory of the bicycle.

''The Dalkey Archive'' features a character who encounters a penitent, elderly and apparently unbalanced [[James Joyce]] (who dismissively refers to his work by saying 'I have published little' and, furthermore, does not seem aware of having written and published ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'') working as an assistant barman or 'curate'—another small joke relating to Joyce's alleged priestly ambitions—in the resort of Skerries. The scientist De Selby seeks to suck all of the air out of the world, and Policeman Pluck learns of the mollycule theory from Sergeant Fottrell. ''The Dalkey Archive'' was adapted for the stage in September 1965 by [[Hugh Leonard]] as ''The Saints Go Cycling In''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishplayography.com/play.aspx?playid=31428 |title=The Saints Go Cycling In |website=Playography Ireland |publisher=Irish Theatre Institute |accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other fiction===
Other books written by O'Nolan include ''[[An Béal Bocht]]''—translated from the Irish as ''The Poor Mouth''—(a parody of [[Tomás Ó Criomhthain]]'s autobiography ''[[An t-Oileánach]]''—in English ''The Islander''), and ''[[The Hard Life]]'' (a fictional autobiography meant to be his "misterpiece").

O'Nolan's theatrical output was unsuccessful. ''Faustus Kelly'', a play about a local councillor selling his soul to the devil for a seat in the Dáil, ran for only 11 performances in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n20/jonathan-coe/clutching-at-railings |title=Clutching at Railings |last=Coe |first=Jonathan |journal=[[London Review of Books]] |volume=35 |number=20 |date=24 October 2013 |pages=21–22 |accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second play, ''Rhapsody in Stephen's Green'', also called ''The Insect Play'', was a reworking of the [[Brothers Čapek|Capek Brothers']] [[Pictures from the Insects' Life|synonymous play]] using anthropomorphised insects to satirise society. It also was put on in 1943 but quickly folded, possibly because of the offence it gave to various interests including Catholics, Ulster Protestants, Irish civil servants, Corkmen, and the [[Fianna Fáil|Fianna Fail]] party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lilliputpress.ie/product/rhapsody-in-stephens-greenthe-insect-play |title=Rhapsody in Stephens Green &amp; The Insect Play |website=[[The Lilliput Press]] |access-date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was thought lost, but was rediscovered in 1994 in the archives of [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/1994/nov/17/news |title=From the dung heap of history |first=Peter |last=Lennon |date=17 November 1994 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, O'Nolan was co-producer of a production for [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]], the Irish broadcaster, of ''3 Radio Ballets'', which was just what it said it was—a dance performance in three parts designed for and performed on radio.

==Legacy==
[[File:ONolan plaque, Strabane (02), January 2010.JPG|thumb|right|Blue plaque for O'Nolan at Bowling Green, [[Strabane]]]]

O'Brien influenced the science fiction writer and conspiracy theory satirist [[Robert Anton Wilson]], who has O'Brien's character De Selby, an obscure intellectual in ''The Third Policeman'' and ''The Dalkey Archive'', appear in his own ''[[The Widow's Son]]''. In both ''The Third Policeman'' and ''The Widow's Son'', De Selby is the subject of long pseudo-scholarly footnotes. This is fitting, because O'Brien himself made free use of characters invented by other writers, claiming that there were too many fictional characters as is. O'Brien was also known for pulling the reader's leg by concocting elaborate conspiracy theories.

In 2011 the '100 Myles: The International Flann O'Brien Centenary Conference' (24–27 July) was held at The Department of English Studies at the University of Vienna, the success of which led to the establishment of 'The International Flann O'Brien Society'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.univie.ac.at/flannobrien2011/IFOBS.html |title=The International Flann O'Brien Society |date=2011 |website=University of Vienna |accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, Trinity College Dublin hosted a weekend of events celebrating the centenary of his birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1015/1224305837854.html |last=Nihill |first=Cian |title=Trinity celebrates Flann O'Brien centenary |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commemorative 55c stamp featuring a portrait of O'Nolan's head as drawn by his brother Micheál Ó Nualláin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2011/1008/1224305446547.html |title=Seven Days |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was issued for the same occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/1004/breaking38.html |title=Writer O'Nolan honoured by stamp |date=4 October 2011 |newspaper=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/republic-of-ireland/stamp-of-approval-on-flann-obriens-centenary-16059202.html |title=Stamp of approval on Flann O'Brien's centenary |last=Sweeney |first=Ken |date=5 October 2011 |newspaper=[[The Belfast Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/05/flann-obrien-loveable-literary-genius |title=Flann O'Brien: lovable literary genius |last=McManus |first=Darragh |date=5 October 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred some 52 years after the writer's famous criticism of the Irish postal service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1005/1224305259131.html |title=An Post gets the message, gives Myles a stamp |last=McNally |first=Frank |date=5 October 2011 |newspaper=The Irish Times |quote=In the course of the 1959 diatribe, he decried the low aesthetic standards of Irish philately and, calling for a better class of artist to be hired, suggested future stamps might also capture more realistic scenes from Irish life, such as "a [[Fianna Fáil|Feena Fayl]] big shot fixing a job for a relative.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bronze sculpture of the writer stands outside the Palace Bar on Dublin's Fleet Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1006/1224305331078.html |title=Palace of inspiration: Sculptures of writers unveiled |last=Nihill |first=Cian |date=6 October 2011 |newspaper=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Myers]] said, "Had Myles escaped he might have become a literary giant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/editorial/kevin-myers-had-myles-escaped-he-might-have-become-a-literary-giant-2892746.html |title=Had Myles escaped he might have become a literary giant |last=Myers |first=Kevin |date=30 September 2011 |newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fintan O'Toole]] said of O'Nolan "he could have been a celebrated national treasure – but he was far too radical for that."&lt;ref name=fotoole_fantastic_oct2011/&gt; An award winning radio play by [[Albrecht Behmel]] called ''[[Ist das Ihr Fahrrad, Mr. O'Brien?]]'' brought his life and work to the attention of a broader German audience in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darstellendekuenste.de/id-2003.html |title=Hörspiel des Monats/Jahres 2003 |website=Akademie der Darstellenden Künste |language=de |accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Nolan has also been semi-seriously referred to as a "scientific prophet" in relation to his writings on [[thermodynamics]], [[quaternion]] theory and [[atomic theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1017/1224305920174.html |title=Trinity plays host to Flann 100 as admirers celebrate comic genius |last=Keating |first=Sara |date=17 October 2011 |newspaper=The Irish Times |quote=In a twist of Mylesian absurdity, however, the highlight of the day's cultural programme proved to be a science lecture by Prof Dermot Diamond, in which Diamond convincingly argued that O'Brien was not just a literary genius but a scientific prophet.

In 2012, on the 101st anniversary of his birth, O'Nolan was honoured with a commemorative [[Google Doodle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/new-media/item/29543-google-celebrates-irish/ |title=Google celebrates Irish author Brian O'Nolan in doodle today |first=Carmel |last=Doyle |date=5 October 2012 |website=Silicon Republic |accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyedge.ie/google-doodle-irish-623199-Oct2012/ |title=Who's that Irish person in today's Google Doodle? |date=5 October 2012 |website=[[The Daily Edge]] |quote=It would have been Irish writer Flann O'Brien's (aka Brian O'Nolan) 101st birthday today.

'''''Buile Shuibhne''''' or '''''Buile Suibhne'''''{{efn|Alternate spellings are  also: Shuibni, Suibne}} ({{IPA-ga|ˈbˠɪlʲə ˈhɪvʲnʲə}}, '''''The Madness of Suibhne''''' or '''''Suibhne's Frenzy''''') is an old Irish tale about the '''Suibhne mac Colmain''', king of the [[Dál nAraidi]], driven insane by [[St. Ronan]]'s curse. The insanity makes Suibhne leave the [[Battle of Mag Rath]], enter a life of wandering (which earns him the nickname Suibne Geilt or "Mad Sweeney"), until he dies under the refuge of [[Mo Ling|St. Moling]].

The tale is the final installment of a three-text cycle in [[Irish bardic poetry]], continuing on from ''Fled Dúin na nGéd'' (''The Feast of Dun na nGéd'') and ''Cath Maige Rátha'' (''The Battle of Mag Rath'').

Suibhne's name appears as early as the ninth century in a law tract (''Book of Aicill''), but ''Buile Suibhne'' did not take its current form until the twelfth century.&lt;ref name="sailor"&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv|last=Sailor |first=Susan Shaw |title=Suibne Geilt: Puzzles, Problems, and Paradoxes|journal=The Canadian Journal of Irish Studies |volume=24 | number =1 |year=1998 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25515239 | doi = 10.2307/25515239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvnb|Ó Béarra|2014}} includes a detailed analysis of the language and date of the text.

==Suibhne's identity==
The identity of Suibhne is a very convoluted matter as several texts mention different Suibhnes in regards with the Battle of Mag Rath.&lt;ref name="sailor"/&gt; Buile Suibhne specifies Suibhne as the son of Colman Cuar and as the pagan king of [[Dál nAraidi]] in [[Ulster]] in [[Ireland]] (in particular in the areas of present-day county Down and county Antrim).&lt;ref name="sailor"/&gt; This particular Suibhne son of Colman's name can also be found in the ''[[Annals of Tigernach]]''&lt;!--Tighenach--&gt; and the [[Book of Lismore]].&lt;ref name="sailor"/&gt; The ''Annals of Tigernach'' state Suibhne, son of Colman, died in the Battle of Mag Rath, making Buile seem a fanciful imagining of dead warrior. Historical records of Dál nAraidi do exist. It was a historical kingdom inhabited by the [[Cruthin]].&lt;ref&gt;MacNeill, Eoin. Phases of Irish History. Port Washington, N.Y.: Kennikat Press, 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; However the king lists of Dál nAraidi in the [[Book of Leinster]] fail to mention any Suibhne son of Colman Cuar as king, and identifies [[Congal Cáech|Congal Claen]] as king of Dál nAraidi during this time. James G. O’Keeffe has hypothesized a possible scenario where Suibhne might have been elected by the Cruthin to act as regent in the midst of King Congal's exile.{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|p=xxxi}}

==Text==
There are three manuscripts, '''B''' (Royal Irish Academy, B iv i), 1671–4; '''K''' (Royal Irish Academy, 23 K 44), 1721–2; and '''L''' (Brussels, 3410), 1629, a condensed version in the hand of [[Michael O'Clery]]. The text can be dated to broadly from 1200–1500 on linguistic grounds, but [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] asserted the writer must have lived before 1197 when the last [[Kings of Tír Chonaill|chieftain of Tir Connail]]&lt;!--Flaithbhertach O'Muldory--&gt; died who was descended from [[Domnall mac Áedo]], since the work is intended to flatter this monarchic dynasty.{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|p=xiii–xix}} 

== Plot ==
===The saint's curse===
In the legend, while St. Ronan was marking boundaries for a new church, the sound of his bell&lt;!--suspended on his breast--&gt; reached Suibhne's ear. Suibhne, upon learning that this was church-making activity on his grounds, rushed out to expel St. Ronan from his territory. His wife Eorann tried to detain him by grabbing his cloak, which unraveled, leaving Suibhne to exit the house stark naked. Suibhne grabbed Ronan's [[Psalter]] and threw it into the lake, and seized the Saint by the hand and started to drag him away. But Suibhne was interrupted by a messenger from [[Congal Cáech|Congal Claen]] requesting aid in the [[Battle of Mag Rath]] (near modern [[Moira, County Down|Moira]], 637 A.D.).

The next day, the Psalter was returned unharmed by an otter that fetched it from the lake. The saint laid a curse upon Suibhne, condemning him to wander and fly around the world naked, and to meet his death by spear-point. In the ongoing war, St. Ronan had mediated a truce to last from each evening until morning, but Suibhne habitually broke this by killing during the hours when combat was not permitted.

One day, Bishop Ronan and his psalmists were on their round blessing the troops. Suibhne too received the sprinkling of [[holy water]], but taking this as a taunt, he killed one of the bishop's psalmists with a spear, and cast another at Ronan himself. The weapon pierced a hole in Ronan's bell (hanging on his breast), and the broken-off shaft hurled in the air. At this, Ronan repeated the same curse: that Suibhne will wander like a bird, much as the spear-shaft, perch on tree branches at the sound of the bell, and die by the spear just as he had killed the monk. When battle resumed, the tremendous noise of the armies clashing drove Suibhne insane. His hands were numbed, his weapons fell, and he began to tread ever so lightly as a bird levitating in the air.{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|pp=3–15}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Dillon |first=Myles |author-link=Myles Dillon |title=Buile Shuibni |work=Early Irish Literature |place=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago |year=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; (It is revealed much later on that like a bird, feathers had grown on him.{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|p=119}})

===The madness and wandering===
The deranged Suibhne then left the battlefield behind, reaching a forest called Ros Bearaigh, in Glenn Earcain{{efn|name="ros-bearaigh-and-earcain"|Ros Bearaigh may be another forest in the vicinity of Ros Earcain ([[Rasharkin]], [[Co. Antrim]]), which occurs as a separte location in this tale, {{harvnb|O'Keeffe|1913|loc=notes, p.162 (to §12, p. 15), 164 (to §17, p.23), 167 (to §35, p.51)}}}} and perched on a [[yew tree]]. He was discovered by his kinsman Aongus the Fat, who was making his retreat from battle. Suibhne fled to Cell Riagain{{efn|[[Kilrean]], {{harvnb|O'Keeffe|1913|loc=notes, p.162}}}} in [[Tir Conaill]], alighting on another tree. There he was surrounded by the forces of [[Domnall mac Áedo]], which was the side Suibhne and his Dál nAraidi kinsmen were warring against. The victorious Domnall nevertheless praised and pitied Suibhne and offered him gifts, but the madman would not comply.{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|pp=15–23}}

Suibhne went to his home territory of Glenn Bolcáin,{{efn|Possibly Glenbuck, near Rasharkin, {{Harvnb|Mackillop|1998|loc="Bolcáin, Glenn", p. 47}}, citing [[Gearóid Mac Eoin]] (1962), "Gleann Bolcáin agus Gleann na nGealt" in ''Béaloideas'' 30; O'Keeffe could not pinpoint it but also believed it to be somewhere in N. Antrim, {{Harvnb|O'Keeffe|1913|p=164}}.}} wandered seven years throughout Ireland, and returned to Glenn Bolcain, which was where his fortress and dwelling stood, and a celebrated valley of madmen.{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|p=x}}{{sfnp|Mackillop|1998|loc="Bolcáin, Glenn", p. 47}} Suibhne's movement was now being tracked by his kinsman Loingsechan, who had successfully taken the madman into custody thrice before. Loingsechan in his millhouse had a chance to capture Suibhne, but the attempt failed, and he must await another chance. Suibhne then paid visit to his wife, who was living with another man, a contender for Suibhne's kingship. Eorann maintained she would rather be with Suibhne, but he told her to remain with her new husband. An army stormed in, but Suibhne eluded capture.{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|pp=23–39, 41, 45–46}}

Suibhne then returned to the yew tree at Ros Bearaigh, the same tree he went to when he first developed his madness, but when Eorann came to deceive and capture him, he moved away to another tree in [[Rasharkin|Ros Ercain]].{{efn|name="ros-bearaigh-and-earcain"}} But his whereabouts was discovered, and Loingsechan coaxed him out of the tree, tricking him with the false news that his entire family had perished. Loingsechan brought Suibhne back to normal life and restored his sanity, but while recuperating, the mill hag taunted him into a contest of leaping. As they leapt, the noise of a hunting party returned Suibhne to madness. The mill hag eventually fell from her leap and was dashed to pieces. And since she was Loingsechan's mother-in-law, it meant Suibhne's could not return to Dál nAraidi without facing vengeance.{{sfnp|Frykenberg|2006|p=1797}}{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|pp=49–83}}

Subhne subsequently wandered various parts of Ireland, into Scotland and Western England. He went from [[Roscommon]] to [[Slieve Aughty]], Slieve Mis, [[Slieve Bloom]] mountain ranges;{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|Names of mountain ranges in Munster, except O'Keeffe believes [[Slieve Mish]] is not meant here, but rather [[Slemish]] in Ulster.{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|loc=Index of Places and Tribes, pp. 194–7}}}} [[Inishmurray|Inismurray]] island; the Cave of [[Donnán of Eigg|St. Donnan]] of [[Eigg]], an island in the Scottish [[Inner Hebrides]];{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|loc=Index of Places and Tribes, p. 195}} then tarried for a month and a half in "Carrick Alastair" ([[Ailsa Craig]] off Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Smyth |first=Daragh |title=A Guide to Irish Mythology |publisher=Irish Academic Press |year=1996|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reached Britain and befriended a Fer Caille (Man of the Wood), who was another madman, spending an entire year together. The Briton giant met his predestined death by drowning in a waterfall.{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|pp=83–105}}

===Death according to prophecy===
"Fly through the air like the shaft of his spear and that he might die of a spear cast like the cleric whom he had slain."

Suibhne then returned to Ireland, to his home dominion of Glen Bocain. He visited his wife Eorann again but refused to go in the house for fear of confinement. Eorann then told him to leave, never to return, because the sight of him was an embarrassment to all.{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|pp=105–111}} But after a while, Suibhne regained his lucidity and made his resolve to go back to [[Dál nAraidi]], whatever judgment may befall him. [[St. Ronan]] learned of this and prayed to God to hinder Suibhne. Suibhne is haunted by headless cadavers and detached heads at [[The Fews|Sliabh Fuaid]].{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|pp=105–111}}

Eventually, Suibhne arrived at "The House of [[St. Moling]]", i.e. Teach Moling ([[St Mullin's]] in [[Co. Carlow]]{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|loc=Index of Places and Tribes, pp. 194–7}}), and Moling harbored him after hearing the madman's story. It might be noted that earlier, Suibhne had sung a stave predicting this place to be the place where he would meet his demise,{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|p=81}} and likewise, the Saint also knew this to be the madman's resting place.{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|p=143}} As Suibhne attended Moling's [[vespers]], the priest instructed a parish woman employed as his cook to provide the madman with a meal ([[Collation (meal)|collation]]), in the form of daily milk. She did so by emptying milk into a hole she made with her foot in the cow dung. However, her husband (Moling's herder) believed malicious hearsay about the two having a tryst, and in a fit of jealousy,  thrust a spear into Suibhne while he was drinking from the hole. Thus Suibhne died in the manner prescribed by Ronan, but received his sacrament from Moling, "as [[Éraic|eric]]".{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|pp=143–147}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dillon|1948|pp=98–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary style==
The poetry in the story of Suibhne is rich and accomplished, and the story itself of the mad and exiled king who composes verse as he travels has held the imagination of poets through to the twentieth century. At every stop in his flight, Suibhne pauses to give a poem on the location and his plight, and his descriptions of the countryside and nature, as well as his [[pathos]], are central to the development of the text. Ó Béarra (2014) includes a detailed analysis of the poetry.&lt;ref&gt;https://vanhamel.nl/codecs/%C3%93_B%C3%A9arra_2014a&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations and adaptions==
Many poets have invoked Sweeney – most notably [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Seamus Heaney]]. Heaney published a translation of the work into English, which he entitled ''[[Sweeney Astray]]''. Eliot made Sweeney the central figure in his verse drama ''[[Sweeney Agonistes]]''. The author [[Flann O'Brien]] incorporated much of the story of ''Buile Shuibhne'' into his [[comic novel]] ''[[At Swim-Two-Birds]]'', whose title is the English translation of the place name "Snamh da en" in the tale.{{sfnp|Mackillop|1998|loc="Buile Shuibhne", p. 63–4}} Another version from the Irish text, titled ''[[The Poems of Sweeny, Peregrine]]'', was published by the Irish poet [[Trevor Joyce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundeye.org/trevorjoyce|title=The Poems of Sweeny, Peregrine|author=Trevor Joyce|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=17 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602185632/http://soundeye.org/trevorjoyce/|archivedate=2 June 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern Irish version of Buile Shuibhne was published in 2010 by Seán Ó Sé.{{sfnp|Ó Sé|2010}} This was the first time that the full original text was made available in modern Irish.

Sweeney also appears as a character in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s novel ''[[American Gods]]'' and is portrayed by [[Pablo Schreiber]] in its [[American Gods (TV series)|TV adaptation]].&lt;ref name="Schreiber"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/05/pablo-schreiber-cast-mad-sweeney-american-gods-starz-thumper-1201752004/|title=Pablo Schreiber To Play Mad Sweeney In ‘American Gods’ Starz Series, Joins Indie ‘Thumper’|work=Deadline|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|date=May 11, 2016|accessdate=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary version of the legend by poet Patricia Monaghan explores Sweeney as an archetype of the warrior suffering from "[[Da Costa's syndrome|Soldier's Heart]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourthorder.org/id37.htm Mad Sweeney&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109142035/http://www.fourthorder.org/id37.htm |date=January 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. D. Snodgrass]] introduces his poem ''Heart's Needle''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15302 Heart's Needle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919122651/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15302 |date=2006-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a reference to ''The Madness of Suibhne''.

Irish poet and playwright [[Paula Meehan]] loosely based her 1997 drama ''Mrs. Sweeney'' on the Sweeney legend. Set in an inner-city Dublin flat complex called The Maria Goretti Mansions (a metaphor for the notorious Fatima Mansions Flats in Dublin), the play examines what life must have been like for Sweeney's wife; as Meehan states, "I wondered what it must have been like to be his woman."&lt;ref&gt;Meehan, Paula, Author's Note for 'Mrs Sweeny', in "Rough Magic: First Plays" (Dublin: New Island Books, 1998), p. 463.&lt;/ref&gt; The play charts the trials and tribulations of Lil Sweeney's life in the Maria Goretti flats as she deals with crime, poverty, unemployment, drug abuse, and tries to come to terms with the premature death of her daughter Chrisse, a heroin addict who died a year before the action starts from an AIDS related illness. Lil's husband, Sweeney, is a pigeon fancier who, upon discovering that all his pigeons have been killed, retreats into a bird-like state.

Irish composer [[Frank Corcoran]] wrote a series of works between 1996 and 2003 around the tale. This includes the choral work ''Buile Suibhne / Mad Sweeney'' (1996, after Heaney), the electro-acoustic composition ''Sweeney's Vision'' (1997), and the chamber work ''Sweeney's Smithereens'' (2000).

[[File:Castelseprio Simeon.jpg|thumb|right|Fresco of St Simeon from ''Santa Maria foris portas'' in Castelseprio.]]

'''Castelseprio''' or '''Castel Seprio''' was the site of a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] fort in antiquity, and a significant [[Lombard League|Lombard]] town in the early Middle Ages, before being destroyed and abandoned in 1287. It is today preserved as an archaeological park in the modern [[Castelseprio (comune)|''comune'' of Castelseprio]], near the modern village of the same name.  It is in the north of Italy, in the [[Province of Varese]], about 50&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Milan]].

The fame of Castelseprio lies in the Early Medieval [[fresco]]es contained in the small Church of ''Santa Maria foris portas''. &lt;!---name is explained below---&gt;These frescoes are of exceptional rarity and artistic significance. Hidden for centuries, the frescoes were only rediscovered in 1944. In 2011, the church - and the castrum with the [[Torba Tower]] - became a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] as part of a group of seven inscribed as [[Longobards in Italy, Places of Power (568-774 A.D.)]].  In 2006, the Italian Ministry of Culture in a submission to [[UNESCO]], said: 
{{quote|text=The frescoes decorating the central apse of the church of Santa Maria foris portas constitute the finest early medieval pictorial cycle in terms of artistic quality, and are considered unique in early medieval European art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/333/ Unesco website]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== History ==
[[File:Santa Maria foris portas2.JPG|thumb|Church of Santa Maria foris portas]] 
Castelseprio originated as a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] fort that commanded an important crossroad. During the early Middle Ages, the Lombards occupied the Roman fort, turning it into a fortified citadel or small town. At one point coins were minted there - a sign of its importance. The Church of ''Santa Maria foris portas'' ("foris portas" meaning "outside the gates" in [[Latin language|Latin]]) which contains the famous frescoes, lay just outside the walls of the citadel. The early dedication of the church to Mary is an assumption; the first documented mention of a church dedicated to Mary in Castelseprio (which is assumed to be this one) comes from the 13th century.

The whole citadel was completely destroyed by [[Ottone Visconti]], [[Archbishop of Milan]], after he captured it in 1287, to prevent it being used again by his rivals. Investigations into the church, which began in 1934, finally uncovered the famous Byzantinesque frescoes below later plaster in 1944.

The whole area is now an archaeological zone containing the remains of the walls and of the much larger three-aisled 5th-century Basilica of [[St John the Evangelist|San Giovanni Evangelista]]. There is also a [[baptistry]] of the 5th to 7th centuries dedicated to [[St. John the Baptist]]. This has two fonts, perhaps for the use of different Rites, and is octagonal with a small apse to the east. A third Church of [[Paul of Tarsus|San Paolo]] has a central hexagonal plan and was built between the 6th and 12th centuries. There are some ruins left from the castle. Nearby is a large tower, once used as a [[convent]].

==Frescoes ==
[[File:Santa Maria foris portas7.JPG|thumb|The rear of the church, with the apse.]]
[[File:Meister von Castelseprio 002.jpg|thumb|right|Fresco of ''Presentation of Jesus in the Temple''.]]

When the Church of Santa Maria foris portas was investigated in 1944, it was found to contain, as well as later frescoes, a highly important and sophisticated cycle of fresco paintings showing very strong [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] influence. The dating of the frescoes and the origin of their painter or painters remain controversial, although the first half of the 9th century seems to be emerging as the most likely date. &lt;!---The speculative info has been put under Style---&gt;

===Subject===

The Byzantinesque frescoes are located around the curved wall of the apse, and the inward surface of the arch between the apse and the main body of the church. 
The condition of the frescoes is variable; some parts are well-preserved whilst others are missing completely, or barely visible. Much of the painted area has been pitted to provide a key for the subsequent plastering-over (see the lower area in the middle of the Presentation scene).

The subjects of the missing or fragmentary scenes are a matter of some scholarly controversy with some writers proposing that these scenes made up a cycle on the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'', and others one on the ''Life of Christ''; these views are described below.

The frescoes are in three registers, the middle register being interrupted by three arched windows. They represent a cycle of the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity of Christ]] and may also have represented early aspects of the Life of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], or of Christ. The lowest register has a decorative [[frieze]] below which there are a few remains in the centre showing painted curtain railings and religious symbols. This register may not have contained figures. The upper and middle registers contain narrative paintings. The cycle may have been part of a larger scheme of decoration which once included the outer face of the arch and the other walls of the church. 
[[File:Maestro di castelseprio, annunciazione e visitazione.jpg|thumb|[[Annunciation]] and incomplete [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]].]]

'''Upper register of narratives:'''
*1) Over the main arch, on the side inward to the apse, rather than in the body of the church, is a ''[[Hetoimasia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;From [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἑτοιμασία "preparation": an iconographic [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] in [[Christian art]] representing an empty throne.&lt;/ref&gt; or Throne of God with symbols on it, in a roundel, with an archangel on either side, flying in a "victory" pose.

Then, on the curved wall of the apse, reading left to right: 
*2) ''[[Annunciation]]'' and ''[[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]]'' - right side incomplete
* missing roundel, which possibly contained the bust of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]]
*3) ''Trial by Bitter Water'' - left side incomplete
*4) Bust of ''[[Christ Pantocrator]]'', in a roundel over central window of the eastern apse. Below the window in the lowest register are traces of a painted [[exedra]] containing a [[Gospel]] book on a cushion.&lt;ref name="Castelseprio Website"&gt;[http://www.castelseprio.net Castelseprio Website]&lt;/ref&gt;
*5) ''Dream of [[Saint Joseph]]''
* missing roundel, which possibly contained the bust of [[John the Baptist]].
*6) ''Journey to [[Bethlehem]]'' - incomplete on the right

'''Middle Register''' 
On the curved wall, reading from right to left :
*7) ''[[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]],'' and ''Annunciation to the shepherds''
*8) ''[[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]]''
Fragmentary remains of two frescoes which may have been:
*9) ''The [[Flight into Egypt]].''&lt;ref name="Castelseprio Website"/&gt; or (in the Marian interpretation) ''The Birth of the Virgin'')
*10) ''The [[Massacre of the Innocents]]'' or (in the Marian interpretation) ''The Presentation of the Virgin at the Temple'')
On the two inner faces of the apsidal arch : 
*11) ''[[Adoration of the Magi]],'' on the inner face of the right side of the arch.
*12) on the inner face of the left side of the arch - remnants perhaps from ''The Dream of the Magi'' or (in the Marian interpretation) ''the Rejection of [[Joachim]]'s Offerings at the Temple'')

'''Chronological sequence'''
The alternative chronological sequences of the ten narrative scenes would run as follows:
*Nativity of Christ:         2,5,3,6,7,8,11,12,9,10
*Life of Mary:       12,9,10,2,5,3,6,7,8,11

In the Marian version the three missing scenes come at the start of the story, rather than the end.  Neither sequence follows a consistent chronological sequence on the wall. Joseph's (first) dream and the trial by bitter water come chronologically between the Annunciation and the Visitation.  The Presentation of Jesus in the Temple should, according to [[Leviticus]] have happened on the fortieth day after the birth.  The timing of the visit of Magi is not mentioned in the [[Gospel]]s, and apochryphal writings placed it between seven days and two years after the Nativity.  The Eastern church, and by the Gothic period the Western church also, at least in art, placed it very soon after the birth, so that the Magi, like the shepherds, are included in Nativity scenes themselves.  At this date, however, the Western church tended to place the arrival of the Magi later, though certainly before the Flight to Egypt and the Massacre of the Innocents.&lt;!---checking other western examples re sequence vs Presentation---&gt; Some departure from chronology to enable thematic or typological connections to be emphasised is a common feature of medieval picture cycles.

====The Marian interpretation====
Some scholars, notably P.D. Leveto,&lt;ref&gt;Leveto op cit.&lt;/ref&gt; interpret the cycle as being "Marian", that is, part of the Life of Mary, rather than specifically representing those scenes associated with the Nativity. Evidence for this interpretation is the presence of the rarely depicted scene of the "Trial by Bitter Water". With this interpretation, the three missing narrative scenes would have had a different content, and the sequence itself would be differently ordered, moving from the left-hand side of the arch to the first two scenes of the lower register, through the top register and then to lower right-hand scenes and finishing with the Magi scene on the opposite side of the arch. In this proposed arrangement, the two scenes of the Birth and Presentation at the Temple of Mary are visually balanced with each other, whilst the Presentation and the Trial by water above it are concerned with Mary's virginity. Also balanced are the two scenes of offerings on either side of the arch wall; in both cases the figures are placed to make their offerings away from the empty arched space, to keep the visual attention focused within the apse.

===Style===
[[File:Meister von Castelseprio 001.jpg|thumb|400px|Fresco of ''Joseph's Dream'' in the church of ''Santa Maria foris portas''.]]

It is thought by some scholars, including Leveto, that two different hands can be detected, but the origins of these artists are uncertain and subject to speculation.

The frescoes are sophisticated, expressive and confident. The artists adapt traditional compositional types to the particular site without strain or disproportion. Poses are natural and rhythmic, and the whole has "a great ardor and conviction, an intense response to the human meaning of the subject" (Schapiro). 
While some aspects of the frescoes, notably the [[iconography]], are clearly Byzantine, others may draw on the Christian art of [[Syria]] or [[Egypt]].

The frescoes also have significant aspects which relate most closely to the late antique art of Italy. Several of the buildings are successfully foreshortened, and the relationship between buildings and figures is more effectively managed than in most Byzantine painting. The painting is done with unusual freedom compared to most Byzantine work; it is this feature in particular which relates to much earlier works from the late antiquity such as paintings found in the [[catacombs of Rome]].

Some art historians see the style as coming from the tradition of [[Alexandria]], from which no other painting on a similar scale remains. John Beckwith is somewhat less enthusiastic than some art historians, describing the frescos as "wholly competent" and worthy of comparison with 7th century works in Rome&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 156&lt;/ref&gt;  He believed the "drapery folds ... a complex series of angular ridges emphasized by highlights ... make a decidedly metallic impression, and betray the copyist, who foreshadows in a disturbing way tenth-century mannerisms".&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 157&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dating===
[[File:Maestro di castelseprio, natività.jpg|thumb|left|The Nativity scene]]
In 1950, soon after the frescoes were first discovered, a poll of the scholars who attended a conference in Castelseprio showed a rough split between dates in the 7th and 10th century, although the extreme range of dates that have been suggested stretches from the 6th to the 14th century - an almost unprecedented range in medieval art history.

Since that time, the range of possible dates has narrowed significantly. Radio-carbon dating of timber and thermoluminescent dating of roof tiles suggest that the church was built in the early to mid-ninth century.&lt;ref&gt;Leveto. n.2 - The average estimated date for the tiles was 828, and the timber gave 865 +/- 87, so between 778 and 952.&lt;/ref&gt;  While providing a reasonably sound date for the church structure, this can only be "terminus post quem" for the frescoes, which may have been added later. However, the rough finish on the interior stonework leads many scholars to believe that the frescoes were added as part of the original building programme.

A "terminus ante quem" was provided by the discovery of [[graffiti]] scratched into the fresco plaster recording a number of clerical appointments, the earliest of which is dated (by the name of the presiding [[Archbishop of Milan]]) to 948 at the latest. Many writers feel that a certain interval must have elapsed after the painting of the cycle before the clergy would have treated the paintings in this way.
[[File:Maestro di castelseprio, cristo benedicente.jpg|thumb|Bust of Christ.]]

Many art historians have pointed to a relationship between the frescoes and two closely related [[manuscript]]s, namely the ''[[Joshua Roll]]'' ([[Vatican City|Vatican]] Library, Ms palatine gr. 431) and the ''[[Paris Psalter]]'' ([[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] Ms Grec. 139) [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Paris_psalter]. However, the dating of both manuscripts is likewise controversial. The art historians [[Kurt Weitzmann]] and [[Meyer Schapiro]] agreed that the artistic quality of the frescoes is superior to that of either manuscript.

Kurt Weitzmann preferred a date shortly before 945, and postulated a connection with a marriage between a Lombard princess and [[Romanos II|a Byzantine prince]], which took place in 944. He favoured as the artist an unknown [[Constantinople|Constantinopolitan]] artist, trained in the same workshop as the artists of the two manuscripts, on a visit in connection with the marriage. Schapiro preferred a date between the 7th and 9th centuries, in 1957 settling on the 8th century.

Most recent writers, relying on the analysis of the timber and roof tiles mentioned above, prefer the first half of the 9th century. Some writers believe the work may have been done by Greek refugees long settled in Italy, or by Italians trained by such artists. Others believe that artists fresh from the Byzantine world were responsible.

===Aspects of the works===
[[File:Maestro di castelseprio, andata a betlemme.jpg|thumb|The ''Journey to Bethlehem'', a scene that in most cycles had already turned into the [[Flight to Egypt]].]] 
Almost every aspect of the frescoes, from the clothing to the treatment of the ''nimbus'' or [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] around the infant Christ, has been analysed and compared to other works in great detail. Some examples are:

* The inscriptions naming various figures are in [[Latin]], and in Roman script, but the midwife at the Nativity is named as "EMEA", the "E" ("H" in the [[Greek alphabet]]) being a form of the Greek for "the". In the Byzantine period it is common to find Greek inscriptions naming figures in paintings which include the definite article. The Greek form of the inscription would be: "H MAIA".
* The treatment of the architectural elements within the paintings has been compared to Hellenizing work produced for [[Islam|Moslem]] patrons in the 8th century, at the [[Umayyad Mosque|Great Mosque]] in [[Damascus]] and elsewhere.
* The legend of the ''doubting midwife'', whose withered arm is miraculously cured, shown in the Nativity scene, probably appears only in art from the West during this period.
* The ''Trial by bitter water'' is otherwise extremely rare in Western iconography, and this is one of the latest of the few Byzantine depictions.&lt;ref name="S"&gt;G. Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'', 1971 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, p. 56 &amp; figs, {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}}. Schapiro mentions also 10th-century frescoes in Cappadocia. Schiller describes this scene as "unknown in Western iconography" (p57), but there is a miniature of it in a French 13th century ''Life of the Virgin'' in St Petersberg (Fr.Fv.XIV.9 F8r), illustrated in T. Voronova and A Sterligov, ''Western European Illuminated Manuscripts'' (in the St Petersberg Public Library), 2003, Sirocco, London&lt;/ref&gt; The legend comes from the apocryphal ''[[Gospel of James|Protoevangelium of James]]'' and occurs, in the fully developed story, after the Dream of Joseph, in which an angel reassures Joseph who is disturbed to discover Mary's pregnancy, since he knows he has not slept with her. In the legend, others also notice the pregnancy and to dispel gossip and accusations, the priests of the Temple (where Mary had formerly been a temple maid) make the couple undergo the trial of drinking "bitter water" — their reaction to which will prove or disprove their innocence.  Naturally they pass. The idea of the trial is clearly based on ''[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 5, 11 ff''.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller op. cit p57&lt;/ref&gt; The legend was part of some Western [[medieval theatre|medieval religious dramas]], in which the "detractors" then drank the water, with horrible results. An example is the ''[[N-Town Plays|N-town Pageant series]]'' manuscript in the British Library, London (BL MS [[Cotton Vespasian]] D.8), which is mid-15th century from the East Midlands of England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~ajohnsto/trial.html Modernised version of the text of the scene from the ''N-town Pageant series''] in the British Library, London (BL MS Cotton Vespasian D.8).

'''CityArts''' in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], is a [[community art]]s organization founded in 1973.

Originally named, ''Grapevine Arts Centre'' and later ''City Arts Centre'', it occupied a number of premises in the centre of Dublin, beginning at Mary Street and then North Great Georges Street,  [[North Frederick Street]], Moss Street and opening at Bachelor's Walk in 2010.  The organisation grew from a need by a group of teenagers in Dublin's culturally bleak mid 20th Century. This was particularly the case if you happened to come from a working-class background, which was the case for most of the Grapevine founders, and is also the reason why the location of the centre was the unfashionable inner city's, North Side. The three main initiators of the project were Jackie Aherne, Anto Fahy and Sandy Fitzgerald.

As the 1970s progressed, the organisation became more culturally politicised, linking in with the radical community arts movement in the UK. This fruitful collaboration resulted in a wider world view and a move to work for a different perspective on culture, one that recognised difference and the rights of people with regard to cultural equality. Linking with similar projects that had emerged (notably City Workshop and Moving Theatre in Dublin and Neighbourhood Open Workshops in Belfast)  in Ireland by the early 1980s, the community arts movement grew to be a force for change, resulting in new policies and perspectives that challenged the cultural orthodoxy. In 1984 the representative group CAFE (Creative Activity For Everyone) was formed, with Grapevine as a founding member.

Grapevine's artistic programme grew alongside its philosophical awareness and this programme was diverse and multifaceted and took place both within the centre, around the suburbs of Dublin and throughout Ireland. Examples of this diversity can seen through its street theatre programme, directed by Thom McGinty (later to become the Diceman), hair cutting, street fashion design studio, audio art, street events, gigs and random acts of fun in public places.  They had an innovative visual arts programme directed for a while{{when|date=May 2016}} by artist [[John Carson (artist)|John Carson]], later of Artangel in the UK.  This included early shows by [[John Kindness]] amongst others including an exhibition of drawings from the survivors of Hiroshima, organised in association with a young [[U2]].

The relationship with U2 continued into the centre's next phase when, in 1988, there was a name change from Grapevine Arts Centre to City Arts Centre when the organisation occupied a warehouse building on Moss Street near [[Tara Street Station]], then the largest centre of its kind in Ireland. U2 provided fully equipped rehearsal spaces for young bands in the basement.  Over this was a cafe and theatre space initially run by Declan Gorman and above that a gallery space initially run by Tommy Weir.   Sandy Fitzgerald continued as Director through to 2001.   The Arts Council never fully backed the centre favouring the highly regarded [[Project Arts Centre]], despite the City Arts Centre clear leadership profile for community arts.

The Centre actually owned this building, having bought it in a then run-down area. However, the property become rather valuable. There was an opportunity to create a large civic project, when a partnership between City Quay School to the rear of the centre and a community hall adjacent to the centre were brought into a scheme for an innovative socio/cultural project at the entrance to the docklands, then at the beginning of its transformation. The scheme needed a piece of vacant land that linked all the properties but Dublin Dockland Development Authority rejected the idea, although both Dublin City Council and The Arts Council, plus all the local representatives supported the project. As a result, City Arts Centre became an anomaly within the dockland development.  Sandy Fitzgerald stepped down as director of the centre in 2000, after 27 years. City Arts Centre, under the directorship of [[Declan McGonagle]], decided to sell the building and to close down its on-site programmes and to engage in what it called the Civil Arts Inquiry, a two-year-long series of meetings, events and symposia aimed at formulating the future needs and future direction of community art. This process proved to be extremely expensive and drained a good deal of the initial capital raised through the sale of the building. However, a new centre was opened on Bachelor's Walk in 2010 with another name change, this time simply called CityArts.

In 2004 the book 'An Outburst of Frankness: Community Arts In Ireland - A Reader' was published by Tasc at New Island. This book, edited by Sandy Fitzgerald, goes into some detail about the history of community arts in Ireland, backed up by essays on the theory and practice of this movement.

==Events==
Throughout the 25-year tenure of City Arts there were a number of varied and quite popular events, some of which succeeded in grabbing press and political attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000049908 City Arts Centre 25 years 1973-1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

The websites themselves are ambivalent on that point.|date=April 2014}}

Throughout history, architects have often been chosen by setting up an [[architectural competition]] and awarding the commission on the basis of the most favoured design. With the advent of the internet, a similar process has been set up by a number of businesses offering small-scale competitions for mainly domestic projects. Like an architectural competition, contributors must register but their designs are judged anonymously, and only the winning design is paid a fee.&lt;ref&gt;http://crowdresearch.org/chi2011-workshop/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business Models==
[[Image:Arcbazar How-it-Works.png|thumb|left|300px|Arcbazar Model: The triumvirate of clients, designers and contractors.]]
An unprecedented business model for [[crowdsourcing]] architectural design was launched by [[Cambridge, MA]] based high-tech company [[Arcbazar]] in 2010. It builds on traditional [[architectural competitions]] and provides an online competition platform for small-to-medium scale architecture, landscape, interior design and remodeling projects; and, builds on the triumvirate of clients, designers and contractors. It connects clients with designers through [[architectural competitions]], and links contractors with construction projects.

There are also a growing number of architectural crowdsourcing platforms that direct their call openly to members of the public, facilitating mass-participation and self-organized collaboration to build upon and improve architectural design solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Lorimer, A.O.D. Mass-participation Architecture, Pearl, 2016, [online] https://pearl.plymouth.ac.uk//handle/10026.1/5293 [17/08/16]&lt;/ref&gt; This follows from Jeff Howe's original definition of the term crowdsourcing, which emphasises the idea of an '''open call''' to an '''undefined''' group of people, because "the person who you think would be best qualified to perform the job, isn't always the best person to do it."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0-UtNg3ots&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Crowdsourcing architecture has been heavily criticized by professional architects and architectural guilds. [[Dwell (magazine)|Dwell]], America's leading home and architecture magazine, called the launch of arcbazar "the worst thing to happen to architecture since the internet started."&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/dwell/status/26889122173947904&lt;/ref&gt; This statement caused many heated debates among architectural bloggers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://aureon.nl/opinie/ontwerpen-2/&lt;/ref&gt; The Architects' Journal, Great Britain's leading professional architecture magazine, wrote: "Architecture crowd-sourcing website criticized: Architects have slammed a threatening new crowd-sourcing website in the US which promises to reduce clients' costs."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/daily-news/architecture-crowd-sourcing-website-criticised/8620481.article&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2716">[[File:Crepinette van struisvogel (2881851130).jpg|thumb|right|Ostrich Crépinettes]]
A '''crépinette''' is a small, flattened sausage, sometimes referred to as a sausage parcel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sausagelinks.co.uk/recipe_detail.asp?id=84 ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is similar in shape to a sausage patty, circular, and flattened.

It is made from minced or ground [[pork]], [[turkey meat|turkey]], [[veal]], [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] or [[chicken (food)|chicken]], and can even be made from [[truffles]].&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicurious.com/tools/fooddictionary/entry/?id=2159|title=Epicurious – Recipes, Menu Ideas, Videos &amp; Cooking Tips|website=Epicurious}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crépinettes are wrapped in [[caul fat]], rather than wrapped in a casing. It is usually cooked with an outer coating of bread and sautéed in butter.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

==Name==

The word ''crépine'' is French for "pig's caul".
The name originated in the second half of the 13th century as "a small ornamental crêpe", being derived from the word crêpe. 
In cookbooks, the term crépinette is sometimes used to indicate the contents of the crépinette only. This is the same as other countries where we find crépinette, sometimes spelled crepinette, to describe both the contents and the dish itself.

==Definition==

A crépinette is a mixture of minced meat stuffed in intestinal membrane.
Although it has a different casing than sausage, it is often described as a sausage dish. It is also described as a round and flat dish in a number of French dictionaries.
The crépinette distinguishes itself by being balled meat wrapped in thin slices of meat.

==Composition==

The stuffing of the crépinette can be made of ground pork, chicken fillets, finely ground game birds (partridge, woodcock, pigeon), and also lamb sweetbreads, calf kidneys, fillets of lark or rabbit, and sliced eel. Viard, however, gives recipes where the contents of the crépinette are not ground but entire pieces of meat.

==Cooking==
The crépinette is cooked in a pan or on a grill.

For Christmas, crépinettes are served with oysters by the oyster farmers of the Marennes-Oléron basin; the same happens in Bordelais where an expert alternates the tasting of a fresh oyster and a hot crépinette.

[[File:Devotional souvenirs in Old City, Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Religious merchandise in [[Jerusalem]], Israel]]
'''Devotional objects''' (also, '''devotional articles, devotional souvenirs, devotional artifacts''') are religious [[souvenir]]s (figurines, pictures, [[votive candle]]s, books, [[amulet]]s, and others), owned and carried by the faithful, who see them as imbued with spiritual values, and use them for [[votive offering]].&lt;ref name="Cini1961"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hourihane2012"/&gt; Production and sales of devotional articles have become a widespread industry in the vicinity of various religious sites all over the world.&lt;ref name="Cini1961"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Park2002"/&gt;

Devotional articles have a long history; in Christianity they have been mentioned in historical works such as those related to [[Paul the Apostle]]&lt;ref name="Schnabel2010"/&gt; and in older religions they have been traced as far back as the times of [[ancient Egypt]] and [[ancient Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref name="Hourihane2012"/&gt; International law defines "devotional articles" as including "the Bible, the [[Koran]], [[prayer book|prayer]] and [[Liturgical book|service books]], [[hymnal]]s, ritual articles, [[sacramental wine]], [[crucifix]]es and [[rosary|rosaries]]".&lt;ref name="FleckBothe2008"/&gt; Such items may be natural and hardly processed (such as earth from the [[Holy Land]]), but majority of modern devotional articles are mass-produced (strips of paper with prayers, pictures of holy figures, prayer books, etc.)&lt;ref name="Cini1961"/&gt; Such items are usually seen as having little artistic value, as their primary function is not decorative but spiritual.&lt;ref name="Cini1961"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hourihane2012"/&gt;

American sociologist [[Charles H. Lippy]] observed that such articles are "means of access to the [[supernatural]]", and are criticized by some as [[superstition]].&lt;ref name="Lippy1994-89"/&gt; Devotional articles owned by famous religious figures, such as [[Catholic Saints]], commonly become [[religious relics]].&lt;ref name="Sharot2001"/&gt; Widespread popularity of certain devotional articles has, throughout centuries, influenced the public popular image of certain religious symbols, such as [[angel]]s.&lt;ref name="MarshallWalsham2006"/&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Editions of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''}}
{{see also|List of Dungeons &amp; Dragons rulebooks}}
Several different editions of the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (''D&amp;D'') fantasy [[role-playing game]] have been produced since 1974. The current publisher of ''D&amp;D'', [[Wizards of the Coast]], produces new materials only for the most current edition of the game. Many ''D&amp;D'' fans, however, continue to play older versions of the game and some third-party companies continue to publish materials compatible with these older editions.

After the original edition of ''D&amp;D'' was introduced in 1974, the game was split into two branches in 1977: the rules-light system of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and the more complex, rules-heavy system of ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' (''AD&amp;D''). The standard game was eventually expanded into a series of five box sets by the mid-1980s before being compiled and slightly revised in 1991 as the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia]]''. Meanwhile, the 2nd edition of ''AD&amp;D'' was published in 1989. In 2000, the 3rd edition, called simply ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', debuted. The 4th edition was published in 2008. The 5th edition was released in 2014.

===Original ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''===
{{main article|Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1974)}}
[[Image:D&amp;d Box1st.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The 1974 ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1974)|Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' box set]]
The original ''D&amp;D'' was published as a [[box set]] in 1974 and featured only a handful of the elements for which the game is known today: just three [[Character class (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|character classes]] ([[Warrior (character class)|fighting-man]], [[Wizard (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|magic-user]], and [[Cleric (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|cleric]]); four races ([[Human (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|human]], [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dwarf]], [[Elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|elf]], and [[Halfling (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|hobbit]]); only a few monsters; only three [[Alignment (role-playing games)|alignments]] (lawful, neutral, and chaotic). The rules assumed that players owned and played the [[Miniature wargaming|miniatures wargame]] ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'' and used its measurement and combat systems. An optional combat system was included within the rules that later developed into the sole combat system of later versions of the game. In addition, the rules presumed ownership of ''[[Outdoor Survival]]'', a board game by then-unaffiliated company [[Avalon Hill]] for outdoor exploration and adventure. ''D&amp;D'' was a radically new gaming concept at the time, and it was difficult for players without prior tabletop wargaming experience to grasp the vague rules. The release of the ''[[Greyhawk (supplement)|Greyhawk]]'' supplement removed the game's dependency on the ''Chainmail'' rules,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Pulsipher | first = Lewis | title = An Introduction to Dungeons &amp; Dragons | periodical = [[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]] | place = London, England | publisher = [[Games Workshop]] | date=February–March 1981 | issue = 23 | pages = 8–9 |quote=''Chainmail'' was needed to conduct combat...." "''Greyhawk'' introduced a new combat system....}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made it much easier for new, non-wargaming players to grasp the concepts of play. It also inadvertently aided the growth of competing game publishers, since just about anyone who grasped the concepts behind the game could write smoother and easier to use rules systems and sell them to the growing ''D&amp;D'' fanbase (''[[Tunnels &amp; Trolls]]'' being the first such).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Pulsipher | first = Lewis | title = Open Box: Tunnels and Trolls | periodical = [[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]] | place = London, England | publisher = [[Games Workshop]] | date = August–September 1977 | issue = 2 | issn = 0265-8712 | postscript =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supplements such as ''[[Greyhawk (supplement)|Greyhawk]]'', ''[[Blackmoor (supplement)|Blackmoor]]'', ''[[Eldritch Wizardry]]'' and ''[[Gods, Demi-Gods &amp; Heroes]]'', published over the next two years, greatly expanded the rules, character classes, monsters and spells. For example, the original ''Greyhawk'' supplement introduced the [[Rogue (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|thief]] class, and weapon damage varying by weapon (as opposed to character class). In addition, many additions and options were published in the magazines ''The Strategic Review'' and its successor, ''[[Dragon (magazine)|The Dragon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dndclassics.com/product/17003/Players-Handbook-1e?it=1|title=Players Handbook (1e)|last=Appelcline|first=Shannon|website=dndclassics.com|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Redirect|Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons|the "[[Community (TV series)|Community]]" episode|Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons (Community)}}
An updated version of ''D&amp;D'' was released between 1977 and 1979 as '''''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons''''' (''AD&amp;D''). The game rules were reorganized and re-codified across three hardcover rulebooks, compiled by [[Gary Gygax]], incorporating the original ''D&amp;D'' rules and many additions and revisions from supplements and magazine articles. The three core rulebooks were the ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (1977), the ''[[Player's Handbook]]'' (1978), and the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' (1979). Major additions included classes from supplements like [[Assassin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|assassin]], [[Druid (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|druid]], [[Monk (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|monk]], [[Paladin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|paladin]], and thief,&lt;ref name="WD10"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Turnbull | first =Don | authorlink =  | title = Open Box: Player's Handbook | journal = [[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]] | issue = 10 | page = 17 | publisher = [[Games Workshop]] | date = December 1978 – January 1979 | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Bard (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|bard]], illusionist and [[Ranger (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|ranger]], which had previously only appeared in magazine articles, were added to the core rulebooks.

Later supplements for ''AD&amp;D'' included ''[[Deities &amp; Demigods]]'' (1980), ''[[Fiend Folio]]'' (another book of monsters produced semi-autonomously in the UK - 1981), ''[[Monster Manual II]]'' (1983), ''[[Oriental Adventures]]'' and ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' (1985), the latter of which mostly compiled material previously published in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine,&lt;ref name="DR95"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gygax |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Gygax |journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] |date=March 1985 |issue=95 |publisher=TSR| title=Demi-Humans Get a Lift|pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

===''Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set'' and revisions===
{{main article|Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set}}
[[File:D&amp;d original.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The cover of the first ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' Basic Set]]

While ''AD&amp;D'' was still in the works, TSR was approached by an outside writer and ''D&amp;D'' enthusiast, [[John Eric Holmes]], who offered to re-edit and rewrite the original rules into an introductory version of ''D&amp;D''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmes|first1=John Eric|title=Fantasy Role Playing Games|date=1981|publisher=Hippocrene Books|location=New York|isbn=9780882545141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although TSR was focused on ''AD&amp;D'' at the time, the project was seen as a profitable enterprise and a way to direct new players to anticipate the release of the ''AD&amp;D'' game. It was published in July 1977 as the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set|Basic Set]]'', collecting together and organizing the rules from the original ''D&amp;D'' boxed set and ''Greyhawk'' supplement into a single booklet, which covered character levels 1 through 3, and included dice and a beginner's module. The booklet featured a blue cover with artwork by [[David C. Sutherland III]]. The "blue booklet" explained the game's concepts and method of play in terms that made it accessible to new players not familiar with tabletop miniatures wargaming. Unusual features of this version included an alignment system of five alignments as opposed to the three or nine alignments of the other versions. This ''Basic Set'' was very popular and allowed many to discover and experience the ''D&amp;D'' game for the first time. Although the ''Basic Set'' is not fully compatible with ''AD&amp;D'', as some rules were simplified to make the game easier for new players to learn, players were expected to continue play beyond third level by moving on to the ''AD&amp;D'' version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holmes|authorlink=John Eric Holmes|first=J. Eric|title=Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set|date=1977| page=6|quote="...experience levels that high are not discussed in this book and the reader is referred to the more complete rules in ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once ''AD&amp;D'' had been released, the ''Basic Set'' saw a major revision in 1981 by [[Tom Moldvay]], which was immediately followed by the release of an ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Expert Set|Expert Set]]'' written by [[David Cook (game designer)|David Cook]], to accompany the ''Basic Set'', extending it to levels 4 through 14, for players who preferred the simplified introductory ruleset. With this revision, the ''Basic'' rules became their own game, distinct both from original ''D&amp;D'' and ''AD&amp;D''. The revised ''Basic'' rules can be distinguished from the original ones by cover colors: the ''Basic'' booklet had a red cover, and the ''Expert'' booklet a blue one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title =D&amp;D Clones! | journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]] | issue = 24 | page =29 | publisher =[[Games Workshop]] |date=April–May 1981 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1983 and 1985 this system was revised and expanded by [[Frank Mentzer]] as a series of five boxed sets, including the ''Basic Rules'' (red cover), ''Expert Rules'' (blue), ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Companion Set|Companion Rules]]'' (green, supporting levels 15 through 25), ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Master Rules|Master Rules]]'' (black, supporting levels 26 through 36), and ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Immortals Rules|Immortals Rules]]'' (gold, supporting Immortals—characters who had transcended levels).

This version was compiled and slightly revised by [[Aaron Allston]] in 1991 as the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia|Rules Cyclopedia]]'', a hardback book which included all the sets except ''Immortals Rules'' which was discontinued and replaced with the ''[[Wrath of the Immortals]]'' boxed set accessory. While the ''Rules Cyclopedia'' included all information required to begin the game, there was a revised introductory boxed set, named ''The New Easy-to-Master Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game'', nicknamed "the black box".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dndclassics.com/product/17171/DD-Rules-Cyclopedia-Basic?src=hottest_filtered&amp;it=1&amp;filters=0_0_44699|title=D&amp;D Rules Cyclopedia|last=Appelcline|first=Shannon|accessdate=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A final repackaging of the introductory set, titled ''The Classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game'' was released in 1994. By the end of 1995, TSR ended its support for the line.

===''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd edition''===
[[File:Advanced_Dungeons_and_Dragons_2nd_Edition_Player's_Handbook.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 2nd edition ''Player's Handbook'']]
In 1987, a small team of designers at TSR led by David "Zeb" Cook began work on the second edition of the ''AD&amp;D'' game, which would take two years to complete.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_History.asp| title=The History of TSR| publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]| accessdate=August 20, 2005| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wizards.com%2Fdnd%2FDnDArchives_History.asp&amp;date=2008-10-04| archivedate=October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, '''''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition''''' was published, featuring new rules and characters.&lt;ref name="D&amp;Dfaq"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_FAQ.asp| title = ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' FAQ| accessdate = October 3, 2008| publisher = Wizards of the Coast| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wizards.com%2Fdnd%2FDnDArchives_FAQ.asp&amp;date=2008-10-03| archivedate = October 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of its first decade, ''AD&amp;D'' had expanded to several rulebooks, including three collections of monsters (''Monster Manual'', ''Monster Manual II'', ''Fiend Folio''), and two books governing character skills in wilderness and underground settings. Gygax had already planned a second edition for the game, which would also have been an update of the rules, incorporating the material from ''Unearthed Arcana'', ''[[Oriental Adventures]]'', and numerous new innovations from ''Dragon'' magazine in the ''Player's Handbook'' and ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' and would have consolidated the ''Monster Manual'', ''Monster Manual II'' and ''Fiend Folio'' into one volume.&lt;ref&gt;Gygax, Gary. "From the Sorcerer's Scroll: The Future of the Game". ''Dragon Magazine'', #103, November, 1985, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the 2nd edition was planned to consolidate the game, but more changes were made during development, while still aiming at backwards compatibility with 1st edition.

The release of ''AD&amp;D 2nd Edition'' corresponded with important policy changes at TSR. An effort was made to remove aspects of the game which had attracted negative publicity, most notably the removal of all mention of [[Demon (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|demons]] and [[Devil (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|devils]], although equivalent fiendish monsters were included, renamed tanar'ri and baatezu, respectively. Moving away from the moral ambiguity of the 1st edition ''AD&amp;D'', the TSR staff eliminated character classes and races like the assassin and the [[half-orc]], and stressed heroic roleplaying and player teamwork. The target age of the game was also lowered, with most 2nd edition products being aimed primarily at teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web||url=http://www.dmsguild.com/product/16868|title=Player's Handbook, Revised (2e)|last=Applecline|first=Shannon|accessdate=February 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was again published as three core rulebooks which incorporated the expansions and revisions which had been published in various supplements over the previous decade. However, the ''Monster Manual'' was replaced by the ''[[Monstrous Compendium]]'', a loose-leaf binder in which every monster is given a full page of information. It was the intention that packs of new monsters (often setting-specific) could be purchased and added to the binder without the expense or inconvenience of a separate book, allowing the book to be updated and customized as needed. This format proved highly susceptibile to wear and tear, however, and presented difficulties in keeping alphabetic order when pages had been printed with monsters on each side. Subsequently, the loose leaf formatting was abandoned and the ''Compendium'' as a core book was replaced by single-volume hardcover ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' in 1993, collecting popular monsters from the ''Compendium''. The edition also greatly increases the power of dragons to counter the impression of relative weakness of the game's titular monster.

Numerous mechanical changes were made to the game. The combat system was modified. The minimum number required to hit a target uses a mathematical formula in which the defender's [[armor class]] (AC) is subtracted from the attacker's THAC0 ("To Hit Armor Class '0'") number, a simplification of 1st edition's attack matrix tables that had appeared as an optional rule in the 1st edition ''DMG''. Distances are based on in-game units (feet) rather than miniatures-board ones (inches). Critical hits are offered as optional rules.

Character creation is modified in many ways. [[Character race (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Demi-human]] races are given higher level maximums to increase their long-term playability, though they are still restricted in terms of character class flexibility. Character classes are organized into four groups: warrior (fighter, paladin, ranger), wizard (mage, specialist wizard), priest (cleric, druid), and rogue (thief, bard). Assassins and monks were removed from the game as character classes, "magic-users" are renamed "mages", illusionists are made into a subtype of the wizard class, along with new classes specializing in the other schools of magic. Proficiencies are officially supported in the ''Player's Handbook'' and many supplements, rather than being an optional add-on. [[Psionics (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Psionics]] are no longer included in the ''Player's Handbook'', though they later appeared in their own supplement.

====Player's Option====
In 1995, TSR re-released the core rulebooks for 2nd Edition with new covers, art, and page layouts.&lt;ref name="2.5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dndclassics.com/product/16862/Player%27s-Option---Combat-%26-Tactics-%282e%29?term=players+option&amp;it=1|title=''Player's Option: Combat &amp; Tactics''|last=Appelcline|first=Shannon|website=dndclassics.com|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These releases were followed shortly by a series of volumes labelled ''Player's Option'', allowing for alternate rules systems and character options, as well as a ''Dungeon Master Option'' for high-level campaigns. They consisted of:
* ''[[Player's Option: Combat &amp; Tactics]]''
* ''[[Player's Option: Skills &amp; Powers]]''
* ''[[Player's Option: Spells &amp; Magic]]''
* ''[[Dungeon Master Option: High-Level Campaigns]]''

Some of the optional rules included the introduction of a point-based system to allow players to pick and choose parts of classes to make their own class, and a more tactical combat system including attacks of opportunity.

===''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 3rd edition===
[[File:Dungeons_and_Dragons_3rd_Edition_Player's_Handbook.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 3rd edition ''Player's Handbook'']]

A major revision of the ''AD&amp;D'' rules was released in 2000. As the ''Basic'' game had been discontinued some years earlier, and the more straightforward title was more marketable, the word "advanced" was dropped and the new edition was named just ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', but still officially referred to as 3rd edition (or ''3E'' for short). It is the basis of a broader role-playing system designed around 20-sided dice, called the [[d20 System]].

[[Monte Cook]], [[Jonathan Tweet]], and [[Skip Williams]] all contributed to the 3rd edition ''Player's Handbook'', ''Dungeon Master's Guide'', and ''Monster Manual'', and then each designer wrote one of the books based on those contributions.&lt;ref name="Dragon #275"&gt;{{cite journal| last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Profiles: Monte Cook| journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue = #275| pages = 10, 12, 14| publisher = Wizards of the Coast| location = [[Renton, Washington]]|date=September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The d20 system uses a more unified mechanic than earlier editions, resolving nearly all actions with a d20 die roll plus appropriate modifiers. Modifiers based on ability scores follow a standardized formula. [[Saving throw]]s are reduced from five categories based on forms of attack to three based on type of defense.

The combat system is greatly expanded, adopting into the core system most of the optional movement and combat system of the 2nd edition ''Players Option: Combat and Tactics'' book. Third edition combat allows for a grid system, encouraging highly tactical gameplay and facilitating the use of miniatures.

New character options were introduced. The new [[Sorcerer (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|sorcerer]] class was introduced. The thief is renamed rogue, a term that 2nd edition uses to classify both the thief and bard classes, and introduces [[prestige class]]es, which characters can only enter at higher character levels, and only if they meet certain character-design prerequisites or fulfill certain in-game goals. Later products included additional and supplementary rules subsystems such as "epic-level" options for characters above 20th level, as well as a heavily revised treatment of psionics.

3rd edition removes previous editions' restrictions on class and race combinations that were intended to track the preferences of the race, and on the level advancement of non-human characters. [[Skills (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Skills]] and the new system of [[Feat (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|feats]] are introduced replacing non-weapon proficiencies, to allow players to further customize their characters.

The d20 System is presented under the [[Open Game License]], which makes it an [[open source]] system for which authors can write new games and game supplements without the need to develop a unique rules system and, more importantly, without the need for direct approval from Wizards of the Coast. This makes it easier to market D&amp;D-compatible content under a broadly recognizable commercial license.

====''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' v3.5====
[[Image:Dnd v3 5 rulesbooks.png|thumb|right|The ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' v. 3.5 core rulebooks]]
In July 2003, a revised version of the 3rd edition ''D&amp;D'' rules (termed ''v. 3.5'') was released that incorporated numerous small rule changes, as well as expanding the ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' and ''Monster Manual''. This revision was intentionally a small one focusing on addressing common complaints about certain aspects of gameplay, hence the "half edition" version number. The basic rules are fundamentally the same, and many monsters and items are compatible (or even unchanged) between those editions. New spells are added, and numerous changes are made to existing spells, while some spells are removed from the updated ''Player's Handbook''.&lt;ref name="update"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dnd/20030718a |title=D&amp;D v3.5 Accessory Update Booklet |work=wizards.com |accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New feats are added and numerous changes are made to existing feats, while several skills are renamed or merged with other skills.

===''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 4th edition===
[[Image:Dungeons_and_Dragons_4th_Edition_Player's_Handbook.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 4th edition ''Player's Handbook'']]
On August 15, 2007, Wizards of the Coast announced the development of ''D&amp;D'' 4th edition. In December 2007, the book ''[[Wizards Presents: Races and Classes]]'', the first preview of 4th Edition, was released. This was followed by a second book in January 2008 named ''[[Wizards Presents: Worlds and Monsters]]''. The ''Player's Handbook'', ''Monster Manual'', and ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' were released in June 2008.

[[Slashdot]] reported anger from some players and retailers due to the financial investment in v3.5 and the relatively brief period of time that it had been in publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/08/22/1847207| title=Gen Con 2007 In A Nutshell| author=Zonk | date=August 22, 2007| accessdate=August 23, 2007| publisher=[[Slashdot.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many players chose to continue playing older editions, or other games such as ''[[Pathfinder Roleplaying Game|Pathfinder]]'',&lt;ref name="wired1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harnish|first=MJ|title=5th Edition D&amp;D Is in Development — Should We Care?|url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2012/01/5th-edition-dungeons-and-dragons/|work=Wired.com|publisher=Conde Nast|accessdate=October 1, 2013|date=January 9, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303225739/http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2012/01/5th-edition-dungeons-and-dragons/|archivedate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the initial print run of the 4th edition sold out during preorders, and Wizards of the Coast announced a second print run prior to the game's official release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/12654.html |title=D&amp;D 4E Back to Press |work=ICv2.com |date= May 30, 2008 |accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike previous editions with just three core rulebooks, 4th edition core rules include multiple volumes of the ''Player's Handbook'', ''Dungeon Master's Guide'', and ''Monster Manual'' that were released yearly, with each new book becoming a part of the core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Dave Noonan, Mike Mearls, and James Wyatt |date=October 5, 2007|title=Episode 16: Monsters, Monsters, Monsters!|quote="So, one of the things that I thought a lot about when I was first putting together the outline for this book... this is not the core ''Monster Manual''....

Of those classes, the first four were included in ''Player's Handbook 2'', while the monk class appears in ''Player's Handbook 3''.

Mechanically, 4th edition saw a major overhaul of the game’s systems. Changes in spells and other per-encounter resourcing, giving all classes a similar number of at-will, per-encounter and per-day ''powers''. Powers have a wide range of effects including inflicting status effects, creating zones, and forced movement, making combat very tactical for all classes but essentially requiring use of miniatures, reinforced by the use of squares to express distances. Attack rolls, skill checks and defense values all get a bonus equal to one-half level, rounded down, rather than increasing at different rates depending on class or skill point investment. Each skill is either trained (providing a fixed bonus on skill checks, and sometimes allowing more exotic uses for the skills) or untrained, but in either case all characters also receive a bonus to all skill rolls based on level. A system of “healing surges” and short and long rests are introduced to act as resource management.

The system of prestige classes is replaced. Characters at 11th level choose a "paragon path", a specialty based on their class, which defines some of their new powers through 20th level. At level 21, an "epic destiny" is chosen in a similar manner., the paragon path and the epic destiny replace the prestige class system of 3rd edition. Core rules extend to level 30 rather than level 20, bringing "[[epic level]]" play back into the core rules.

====''Dungeons &amp; Dragons Essentials''====
This product line debuted in September 2010 and consisted of ten products intended to lower the barrier of entry into the game. ''Essentials'' uses the ''D&amp;D'' 4th edition rule set and provides simple player character options intended for first-time players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://critical-hits.com/2010/01/29/dd-xp-2010-dungeons-dragons-essentials/ |title=D&amp;D XP 2010: Dungeons &amp; Dragons Essentials — Critical Hits |publisher=Critical-hits.com |date=January 29, 2010|accessdate=September 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the new player character options emulated features from previous editions, such as schools of magic for the wizard class, as to appeal to older players who had not adopted 4th edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Complete Mike Mearls D&amp;D 4th Edition Essentials Interview |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/writersroom/8115-Complete-Mike-Mearls-D-D-4th-Edition-Essentials-Interview |title=&amp;#124; The Escapist |publisher=Escapistmagazine.com|accessdate=September 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Wizards of the Coast announced that a new edition of the game, at the time referred to as ''D&amp;D Next'', was under development.&lt;ref name="wired1"/&gt; In direct contrast to the previous editions of the game, ''D&amp;D Next'' was developed partly via a public open playtest.&lt;ref name="NYT remake"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/arts/video-games/dungeons-dragons-remake-uses-players-input.html | title=Players Roll the Dice for Dungeons &amp; Dragons Remake | work=[[The New York Times]] | author=Gilsdorf, Ethan | page=2 | date=January 9, 2012 | accessdate=January 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early build of the new edition debuted at the 2012 ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons Experience'' event to about 500 fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ohannessian|first=Kevin|title="Dungeons &amp; Dragons Next" Creators Look To Simplicity, Open Development To Regain Lost Gamers|url=http://www.fastcocreate.com/1679620/dungeons-dragons-next-creators-look-to-simplicity-open-development-to-regain-lost-gamers|accessdate=August 30, 2013|newspaper=Co.Create|date=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public playtesting began on May 24, 2012,&lt;ref name="Next playtest starts"&gt;{{cite web |author=Mike Mearls |url=http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4news/20120425a |title=Dungeons &amp; Dragons Roleplaying Game Official Home Page - Article (News on D&amp;D Next) |publisher=Wizards.com |date=April 25, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720201719/http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd%2F4news%2F20120425a |archivedate=July 20, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the final playtest packet released on September 20, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4news/20130920 |title=Final Playtest Packet |publisher=Wizards.com |date=September 20, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140721200345/http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd%2F4news%2F20130920 |archivedate=July 21, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5th edition's ''Basic Rules'', a free [[PDF]] containing complete rules for play and a subset of the player and DM content from the core rulebooks, was released on July 3, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules?x=dnd/basicrules |title=5E Basic Rules |publisher=Wizards.com |date=July 3, 2014|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Starter Set'' was released on July 15, featuring a set of pre-generated characters, a set of instructions for basic play, and the adventure module ''Lost Mine of Phandelver''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_starterset?x=dnd/products/dndacc/starterset |title=5E starter Set |publisher=Wizards.com |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Player's Handbook'' was released on August 19, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mearls |first=Mike |url=http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook |title=Player's Handbook &amp;#124; Dungeons &amp; Dragons |publisher=Dnd.wizards.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth edition ''Monster Manual'' was released on September 30, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/monster-manual|title=Monster Manual|publisher=wizards.com|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' was released on December 9, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mearls |first=Mike |url=http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/dungeon-masters-guide |title=Dungeon Master's Guide &amp;#124; Dungeons &amp; Dragons |publisher=Dnd.wizards.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The edition returns to having only three core rule books, with the ''Player’s Handbook'' containing most major races and classes.

Mechanically, 5th edition draws heavily on prior editions, while introducing some new mechanics intended to simplify and streamline play. Actions are now more dependent on checks made with the six core abilities with skills taking a more supportive role.

Skills, weapons, items, saving throws and other things that characters are trained in now all use a single proficiency bonus that increases as character level increases. Multiple defense values have been removed, returning to a single defense value of armor class and using more traditional saving throws. Saving throws are reworked to be situational checks based on the six core abilities instead of generic d20 rolls. Feats are now optional features that can be taken instead of ability score increases and are reworked to be occasional major upgrades instead of frequent minor upgrades.

The "advantage/disadvantage" mechanic was introduced, streamlining conditional and situational modifiers to a simpler mechanic: rolling two d20s for a situation and taking the higher of the two for "advantage" and the lower of the two for "disadvantage" and canceling each other out when both apply.

The power system of 4th edition was replaced with more traditional class features that are gained as characters level. Each spell-casting class uses a unique system to cast their spells, with wizards and clerics using a slightly modified version of the spell preparation system of previous editions. Healing Surges are replaced by Hit Dice, requiring a character to roll a hit die during a short rest instead of healing a flat rate of hit points.

==''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' variants==
[[Kenzer &amp; Company]] received permission from Wizards of the Coast to produce a parody version of 1st and 2nd edition ''AD&amp;D''. They published the humorously numbered ''[[HackMaster]]'' 4th edition from 2001 until they lost their license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kenzer|first1=David S.|authorlink=David Kenzer|title=HackMaster: A History|url=http://www.kenzerco.com/hackmaster/pdf/hackmaster_history.pdf|website=[[Kenzer &amp; Company]]|accessdate=January 29, 2018|date=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was well received and won the [[Origins Award]] for ''Game of the Year 2001''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2001 - List of Winners|url=http://www.originsgames.com/awards/2001|website=The Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design|publisher=Wayback Machine|accessdate=January 29, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830114254/http://www.originsgames.com/awards/2001|archivedate=August 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new edition of ''Hackmaster'' was released in 2011 that no longer uses ''AD&amp;D'' mechanics as Kenzer &amp; Company's license expired. 

The publication of the [[System Reference Document]] (SRD) for 3rd edition under the [[Open Game License]] (OGL) allowed other companies to use the rules to create their own variants of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', providing that they did not use anything Wizards of the Coast considered trade dress or signature content, known as "product identity" under the terms of the OGL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/d20/files/OGLv1.0a.rtf|title=Open Gaming License v1.0a|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|date=2000|accessdate=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Castles &amp; Crusades]]'', published in 2004 by [[Troll Lord Games]], is an early example of the OGL and SRD being used to recreate the experience of older editions.&lt;ref name="OSRhistory"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malisczewski|first1=James|title=Full Circle: A History of the Old School Revival|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/tabletop/columns/days-of-high-adventure/6412-Full-Circle-A-History-of-the-Old-School-Revival|accessdate=November 23, 2015|work=The Escapist|date=August 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons retro-clones|Retro-clones]]" are variants created to even more closely simulate previous editions, part of a movement known as the [[Old School Revival]].&lt;ref name="OSRhistory"/&gt; Prominent retro-clones include ''[[Labyrinth Lord]]'', ''[[OSRIC]]'', and ''[[Swords &amp; Wizardry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harnish|first1=MJ|title=Everything Old Is New Again: Old School D&amp;D|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/08/everything-old-is-new-again-old-school-dd/|accessdate=November 23, 2015|work=Wired|date=August 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''[[Pathfinder Roleplaying Game]]'' was first published in 2009 by [[Paizo Publishing]]. It is intended to be backward-compatible with ''D&amp;D'' v. 3.5 while adjusting some rules balance, and has been nicknamed "v. 3.75" by some fans.&lt;ref name="present"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tito|first=Greg|title=The State of D&amp;D: Present|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/features/9293-The-State-of-D-D-Present.2|work=The Escapist|accessdate=1 October 2013|date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Baichtal|first=John|title=No D&amp;D 4E for Paizo?!?|url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2008/03/no-dd-4e-for-pa/|work=Wired.com|publisher=Conde Nast|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717020004/http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2008/03/no-dd-4e-for-pa|archivedate=July 17, 2012 |accessdate=October 1, 2013|date=March 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pathfinder has been one of the best-selling role playing games in the industry.&lt;ref name="wired1"/&gt;

''[[13th Age]]'' is a game designed by [[Jonathan Tweet]], a lead designer of the 3rd Edition, and [[Rob Heinsoo]], a lead designer of 4th Edition, and published by [[Pelgrane Press]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pelgranepress.com/?p=12345 |title=Pelgrane Press Ltd » Blog Archive » Through the Scrying Glass: 13th Age Released |publisher=Pelgranepress.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International editions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
The ''D&amp;D'' franchise has been translated and published in several languages around the world.

A particular challenge has been the word [[dungeon]], which in standard English means a single prison cell or [[oubliette]] originally located under a [[keep]]. Some languages, like Spanish, Italian, Finnish, and Portuguese, didn't translate the title of the game and kept it as it is in English: ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''. In Spanish-speaking countries, the 1983 animated series was translated in [[Hispanic America]] as ''Calabozos y Dragones'' and in [[Spain]] as ''Dragones y Mazmorras'' (''calabozo'' and ''mazmorra'' have in all Spanish-speaking countries the same meaning: a dungeon). In [[Brazil]], the same animated series was translated as ''Caverna do Dragão'' (''Dragon's Cave''). This still brings great confusion amongst Spanish-speaking and Brazilian gamers about the name of the game, since all Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese translations of the game kept the original English title. In gaming jargon, however, a dungeon is not a single holding cell but rather a [[dungeon crawl|network of underground passages]] or [[Subterranea (geography)|subterranea]] to be explored, such as a [[cave]], [[ruins]] or [[catacombs]]. Some translations conveyed this meaning well, e.g. Chinese ''龙与地下城'' (''Dragons and Underground Castles'', or ''Dragons and Underground Cities''). Some translations used a [[false friend]] of "dungeon", even if it changed the meaning of the title, such as the French ''Donjons et dragons'' (''Keeps and Dragons''). In Hebrew, the game was published as ''מבוכים ודרקונים'' (''Labyrinths and Dragons''). Additionally, some translations adopted the English word "dungeon" as a game term, leaving it untranslated in the text as well.

[[Image:Donostia Aizpurua Klub Nautikoa.jpg|thumb|''[[w:es:Club Náutico de San Sebastián|Club Náutico de San Sebastián]]'' (1929) designed by [[José Manuel Aizpúrua]] and [[Joaquín Labayen]]]]
'''GATEPAC''' (Grupo de Artistas y Técnicos Españoles Para la Arquitectura Contemporánea) was a group of architects assembled during the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Its most important members were: [[Josep Lluís Sert]], [[Antoni Bonet Castellana]], [[Josep Torres Clavé]], [[José Manuel Aizpurúa]], [[Fernando García Mercadal]] and [[Sixte Illescas]].

The group was formed in the 1930s as a Spanish branch of [[C.I.A.M.]] The Eastern (Catalan) and founding section of the group, called [[GATCPAC]] (Grup d'Arquitectes i Tècnics Catalans per al Progrés de l'Arquitectura Contemporània) was much more successful than the Central or Northern sections, and carried out government contracts during the Second Republic.  GATCPAC also published the magazine ''A.C.'', or ''Actividad Contemporánea'', which remains an important document for the history of Modern Movement in Spain.

Most, but not all GATEPAC members fought on the Republican side during the [[Spanish Civil War]].  Torres Clavé was killed in action.  [[Josep Lluís Sert]] went into exile in the United States, where he would teach at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]].  Antoni Bonet established himself in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Having been associated with the Second Republic, GATEPAC was taboo in [[Francoist Spain]] and reference to it was often censored until the 1950s, when their works were taken up by a new generation of Spanish modern architects like the Catalan [[Oriol Bohigas]].

'''George Lansing Raymond''', (1839–1929)&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/search.php?query=george%20lansing%20raymond Internet Archive Search: george lansing raymond&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
was a prominent professor of Aesthetic Criticism at Princeton University (1881–1905)&lt;ref&gt;General Catalogue of Princeton University 1746-1906, p.35 and 36, available via books.google.com&lt;/ref&gt; and author of a new system of esthetics.  
He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] seven times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=7587 |title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also served as a professor at George Washington University (D.C.) and Williams College (his alma mater).

==Career==
Author of a systematic theory of art published by G.P. Putnam,  published in seven volumes during the period 1886 to 1900, and republished as a set of uniform volumes in 1909.  Additionally an eighth volume was published, as a summary of the seven volumes, titled, ''Essentials of Esthetics''.  A volume of excerpts of his seven books, edited by the classical scholar Marion Mills Miller, was also published by Putnam in 1920.  (see publication list below)

Raymond was an art theorist who created the first comprehensive and systematic theory of the arts.&lt;ref&gt;''An Art-Philosopher’s Cabinet'', Marion Mills Miller, G.P. Putnam’s Sons, 1915, page ix of introduction&lt;/ref&gt;  The New York Times said "In a spirit at once scientific and that of the true artist, he pierces through the manifestations of art to their sources, and shows the relations, intimate and essential, between painting, sculpture, poetry, music, and architecture." &lt;ref&gt;quoted in, ''An Art-Philosopher’s Cabinet'', Marion Mills Miller, G.P. Putnam’s Sons, 1915, page x of introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

He was rare among art theorists of the time (and since), to use psychology and physiology and biological factors to ground his art theory, and to use detailed discussions of specific art works to validate his views.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', [JAAC articles available to JSTOR subscribers] Thomas Munro, v.13 p.533-537&lt;/ref&gt;

His work is neglected, although some scholars say his system deserves resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'' , Vol. 19 no.3 p.327-337&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', “The Strange Neglect of G. L. Raymond.”, Thomas Munro, v.13 p.533-537&lt;/ref&gt;

His basic approach is as stated in his summary one-volume book ''Essentials of Esthetics'':
''"The phenomena of the arts of the highest class have been traced [in this book] to their sources in material nature and in the human mind; the different arts have been shown to be developed by exactly similar methods; and these methods have been shown to characterize the entire work of artistic imagination, from the formulation of psychical concepts to that of their most physical expressions in rhythm, proportion and harmony."''

He was also a vocal advocate of a scientific and rational Christianity.  He seemed to be following in Aquinas’ footsteps in believing he could rationalize religious belief with science.

He was also a widely published poet during the latter part of the 19th century, though with no lasting celebrity.

He wrote works on oratory (i.e., rhetoric), early in life, since he a professor of oratory; and later in life after retiring from his professorships, he wrote a book on ethics and natural law.

Three of his books (the last two in the esthetic book list above, and one on ethics) are available in full digital text form at subscriber website www.questia.com.  In 2008 and 2009, all of these books were re-published by Kessinger Publishing and Bibliolife Publishing in hardcover and paperback.  The title "Genesis of Art-Form" is also accessible for free at www.esthetics.cc (along with an archival copy of the New York Times 1893 book review of that book).  Most of his series of seven volumes comprising his seven volumes on aesthetics is  available in digital form at books.google.com.

==Personal life==
Raymond was the son of [[Benjamin Wright Raymond]], twice [[Mayor of Chicago]]. He was educated at [[Phillips Academy]], Andover, graduating in 1858, and Williams College where he was a member of the [[Kappa Alpha Society]].
He married Mary Elizabeth Blake in 1872.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1287">'''Glass animal collectibles''' are tiny blown glass [[animal figurines]] that serve as collectibles. It takes skill to make each individual one and each figurine has a different and unique color. To make glass animals requires a torch kit, a kiln, glass, and rods.

== History ==
Back in the 1860s carousel figurines spread to the United States. Dustav Dentzel started a company that made the parts. Art Nouveau is known for his cameo glass. He used the acid-cutting method to create his pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Kovel, Terry. "Carousel Figures." ''MasterFILE Premier.'' EBSCO, July 2011. Prink. 27 Mar 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient glassworkers would make vessels, vases, and eating utensils. The glass was decorated by adding molten colored glass drips to the final product. [[Glassblowing]] was introduced to shape the glass.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Norman A. "Treasures of Ancient Glass." ''Treasures of Ancient Glass'' 26.12 (2011):2. Rpt. in ''World &amp; I. Vol. 26.

'''Halfrek''' or '''Hallie''' is a recurring fictional character on the [[television|TV]] series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]].'' She appears as a [[vengeance demon]] in seasons 6 and 7, and has previously appeared as '''Cecily''' in season 5. She is played by actress [[Kali Rocha]].

==Halfrek==
Halfrek is a long-time associate and sometime friend of [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]], who knew her from her days as a vengeance demon. The two had worked together in the past, notably during the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]]. However, Halfrek's ''raison d'etre'' differed from Anya's. Whereas Anya was an avenger of scorned women, Halfrek's "thing" (as Anya put it) is to perform vengeance for children who have been wronged by their parents or guardians. Anya attributes this to "daddy issues". Even after Anya ceases to be a vengeance demon, she continues her friendship with Halfrek. Like Anyanka used the name Anya when masquerading as human, Halfrek's mortal persona goes by the name Hallie.

In her second appearance in season 6, Halfrek poses as a guidance counselor and coaxes [[Dawn Summers|Dawn]] into making a wish. Feeling that no one wants to spend time with her, Dawn wishes that people would never leave; Halfrek therefore casts a spell that prevents anyone from leaving the Summers residence. The crisis ends when Halfrek herself is caught in the spell and has to break it. Halfrek also appears as a bridesmaid at the failed wedding of Anya and [[Xander Harris|Xander]]. Early in season 7, Halfrek attempts to coax Anya back into vengeance, but Anya has spent too long as a mortal to return to her old life; while she was initially successful in her return to demonhood, she subsequently regrets the deaths she has caused. [[D'Hoffryn]] asks Anya what she wants, and she says that she wants to reverse the vengeance she had done. D'Hoffryn grants her wish, telling her that it'll require the sacrifice of a vengeance demon's body and soul. Believing she is about to die, Anya is resigned to her fate—only to watch helplessly as D'Hoffryn summons her friend Halfrek and incinerates her in front of Anya.

==Cecily==&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)]] --&gt;

In the season 5 episode "[[Fool for Love (Buffy episode)|Fool For Love]]", Halfrek uses the persona of Cecily while on a job to kill all the guests at a party Spike is attending. Cecily, being the upper-class object of the then-human [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|William's]] affections in [[Victorian Era|Victorian]] England circa 1880 spurns William's advances, saying he is "beneath her", and upsetting him greatly. This sets in motion the events that lead William to accept comfort from [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]], and become a [[vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampire]]. (Cecily's surname was implied to be ''Underwood'' in the episode "[[Lies My Parents Told Me]]", but stated to be ''Addams'' in the script and credits of "Fool for Love" and the non-canon tie-in novel ''These Our Actors''.)

==Identity==
In the season 6 episode "[[Older and Far Away]]", Halfrek recognizes Spike and calls him by his human name, William. Spike also recognizes Halfrek, but when asked to explain this they both sheepishly deny being acquainted. This implies that Halfrek had previously been Cecily. However, Halfrek and Anya witnessed the [[Crimean War]] (circa 1853) which is mentioned in "[[Lessons (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Lessons]]" and shown in "[[Selfless (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Selfless]]". The timing of this event would indicate that Halfrek existed as a demon at least three decades prior to the adoption of the youthful human form in Cecily. Joss Whedon and Kali Rocha have both stated that, in their minds at least, Halfrek and Cecily were indeed the same entity. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Halfrek later appeared in the comic ''[[Spike: Old Times (Angel comic)|Spike: Old Times]]'', which established that she was 'on a job' at the time that William fell for Cecily. She seems to have had at least some pity for William in spite of her rejection of him, as the night he became a vampire, she caused the deaths of the rude party-goers who had laughed at his poetry.

Continuity-wise, the comic story takes place in Buffy Season 6, and assumes that an ensouled Spike briefly left Sunnydale and visited LA.

==Appearances==
; ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' : Halfrek/Cecily has appeared in 7 Buffy episodes as a guest.
*Season 5: "[[Fool for Love (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Fool for Love]]" (as Cecily)

[[File:Calco della testa di satiro attr. al buonarroti e rubato dal bargello nel 1944.JPG|thumb|Cast of a head in [[Bargello Museum]] until 1944, once attributed as Michelangelo's ''Head of a Faun'']]
'''''Head of a faun''''' is a lost sculpture by Italian Renaissance master [[Michelangelo]], dating from c. 1489. His first known work of sculpture in marble, it was sculpted when he was 15 or 16 as a copy of an antique work with some minor alterations. According to [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s biography of the artist, it was the creation of this work that secured the young Michaelangelo the patronage of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]].

'''''Hooray for Diffendoofer Day!''''' is a [[children's literature|children's book]] credited to [[Dr. Seuss]] "with some help from [[Jack Prelutsky]] and [[Lane Smith (illustrator)|Lane Smith]]". The book is based on verses and sketches created by Seuss before his death in 1991, and was expanded to book length and completed by writer Prelutsky and illustrator Smith for publication in 1998.

The story surrounds a school that is well liked by its students notably because of its many eccentric teachers. However, the students must make a good grade on a [[standardized test]] (which turns out in the end to be a revising test on multiple subjects they regularly learn) lest they be sent to an adjacent school, which requires uniforms to be worn and is incredibly dull.{{Dr. Seuss}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1562">The {{nihongo|'''Japan Photographic Society'''|日本写真会&lt;ref&gt;In the orthography of the time, 日本寫眞會.&lt;/ref&gt;|Nihon Shashinkai}} was a [[Tokyo]]-based organization of photographers founded in 1889 that continued until the closing years of the nineteenth century.

The JPS started as Japan's first organization for amateur photographers, although professionals later joined as well. Of the fifty-six founding members, twenty-four were foreigners, and among these [[W. K. Burton]] served as secretary. The JPS arranged various photographic activities: criticism, modeling sessions, exhibitions and so forth. The members' works were published in the magazine ''[[Shashin Shinpō]].''  The society seems to have folded at some time shortly after 1896, as a result of the bankruptcy of its main sponsor, [[Kajima Seibei]].

[[Japan Photographic Society (1924–)|A later organization with the same name]] is unrelated.

'''Jørgen Valentin Sonne''' (24 June 1801, [[Birkerød]] – 24 September 1890, [[Copenhagen]]) was a Danish [[Genre art|genre]] painter; known primarily for his battle scenes.

== Biography ==
His father, Jeppe (1771–1833), was a [[copperplate engraver]] for the [[Royal Mint (Denmark)|Royal Mint]]. He originally intended to pursue a military career and enrolled at the [[Royal Danish Military Academy]], but left after a year and went to the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] instead.&lt;ref name="S"&gt;[http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Maler/J%C3%B8rgen_Sonne Brief biography] @ Den Store Danske.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he began to work in the studios of [[Christian David Gebauer]], mostly making copies of the old [[Dutch Masters]].&lt;ref name="K"&gt;[https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisKunstner.do?kunstnerId=1116 Biographical notes] @ Kunstindeks Danmark.&lt;/ref&gt; He also painted some original pictures and had a small showing in 1818. 
[[File:Jørgen V. Sonne - Rural Scene - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|185px|left|Rural Scene (1848)]]
In 1828, he received a travel stipend from the Academy that allowed him to visit Munich, where he became an apprentice of the history painter, [[Peter von Cornelius]].&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; He stayed there for three years and made several trips into the mountains to do landscapes, which are not among his best works.

When he left Munich, he was able to obtain further support for studies in Rome. While there, he made numerous hunting trips as an excuse to observe the rural peasants and their daily habits. During these trips he made sketches that he would use as inspiration throughout his career.&lt;ref name="S" /&gt;

He returned to Denmark in 1841; producing works based on his Italian studies as well as ones depicting the Danish peasantry. In 1848, following the start of the [[First Schleswig War]], he was given permission to accompany the army to [[Southern Jutland]].&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; Many of the soldiers were impressed by the way he calmly sketched while bullets flew around him. During the [[Second Schleswig War]], despite being sixty-three years old, he was with the army again, at the [[Battle of Dybbøl]] and in [[Sønderborg]] when the city was under bombardment. 
[[File:Dybbol Skanse.jpg|thumb|325px|Scene from the Battle of Dybbøl]] 
In 1865, he was awarded the {{ill|Anckerske Legat|da|Det anckerske Legat}} (a scholarship for writers, artists and composers) and was able to return to Italy for a year.&lt;ref name="S" /&gt; In addition to his canvases, he is known for designing a large mural on the exterior walls of the [[Thorvaldsen Museum]] and illustrations for a Danish translation of the Hindu play, ''[[Shakuntala]]''.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; He was appointed [Order of the Dannebrog|Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog]] in 1852, and received the [[Dannebrogordenens Hæderstegn]] in 1881.

During his last decade, he began having eye problems and became too weak to paint for long periods. To the end, his artistic outlook was conservative; believing that the latest trends were simply a way to hide lack of content. He never married.&lt;ref name="S" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18010">{{Situationists |expanded=Organizations}}

The '''Letterist International''' ('''LI''') was a [[Paris]]-based collective of radical artists and theorists between 1952 and 1957. It was created by [[Guy Debord]] as a [[Wiktionary:schism|schism]] from [[Isidore Isou]]'s [[Lettrism|Letterist]] group. The group went on to join others in forming the [[Situationist International]], taking some key techniques and ideas with it.&lt;ref name="Kaufmann2011"&gt;Kaufmann, Vincent (2011) [http://www.institutfrancais.com/adpf-publi/folio/g_debord/ ''Guy Debord''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110723180331/http://www.institutfrancais.com/adpf-publi/folio/g_debord/ |date=23 July 2011 }} for the ''[[Institut français]]''. English translation ''[http://www.institutfrancais.com/adpf-publi/folio/textes/debord-eng.rtf Guy Debord]{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}'' by Martin Richet&lt;/ref&gt;

The spelling 'Lettrist' is also common in English, but 'Letterist' was the form the French group (''Internationale Lettriste'') themselves preferred, and used in their 1955 sticker: 'If you believe you have genius, or if you think you have only a brilliant intelligence, write the letterist internationale.' With regard to that second word, however, most scholars prefer 'International' to 'Internationale'.{{citation needed|reason=source f quote?|date=July 2016}} Such authors and translators as [[Donald Nicholson-Smith]], [[Simon Ford]], Sadie Plant and Andrew Hussey all agree on the 'Letterist International' spelling.

The group was a motley assortment of novelists, [[sound poetry|sound poets]], painters, film-makers, revolutionaries, bohemians, alcoholics, petty criminals, lunatics, under-age girls and self-proclaimed failures.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} In the Summer of 1953, their average age was a mere twenty years old, rising to twenty nine and a half in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;''Internationale situationniste'', no. 2, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt; In their blend of intellectualism, protest and hedonism—though differing in other ways, for instance in their total rejection of spirituality—they might be viewed as French counterparts of the American [[Beat Generation]], particularly in the form it took during exactly the same period, i.e. before anyone from either group achieved any real fame, and were still having the adventures that would inform their later works and ideas.

==History and theory==
The LI was the first breakaway faction from [[Isidore Isou]]'s [[Lettrism|Letterists]]. (They would be followed in turn by the [[Ultra-Lettrists|Ultra-Letterists]]). The schism developed when the 'left-wing' of the Letterist group disrupted a [[Charlie Chaplin]] press conference for ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' at the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris]] in October 1952. They distributed a [[polemic]] entitled "No More Flat Feet", which concluded: "The footlights have melted the make-up of the supposedly brilliant mime. All we can see now is a lugubrious and mercenary old man. Go home Mister Chaplin." Isou was keen to distance himself from his younger acolytes' tract. His own attitude was that Chaplin deserved respect as one of the great creators of the cinematic art. The breakaway group felt that he was no longer relevant, and they turned Isou's own words back against him: "We appreciated the importance of Chaplin's work ''in its own time'', but we know that today novelty lies elsewhere, and 'truths which no longer entertain become lies' (Isou)." As they proceeded to explain, "the most urgent exercise of liberty is the destruction of idols".&lt;ref&gt;''Internationale lettriste'', no. 1, emphasis in original.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the LI had in fact already been covertly formed by [[Guy Debord]] and [[Gil J. Wolman]] in June 1952, even before the Chaplin intervention and the public split from Isou, it was not formally established until 7 December 1952. The four signatories of the Chaplin tract (Debord and Wolman, together with [[Jean-Louis Brau]] and [[Serge Berna]]) agreed on a constitution for the group during a visit to [[Aubervilliers]] (where Brau's father lived). Anyone collaborating with 'Isouian activities', they declared, would be automatically excluded, even if this was being done in defence of the LI. 'It is in the transcendence of arts that everything has yet to be done.'&lt;ref&gt;Mension, ''The Tribe'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The official base of the group was at 32, Rue de la Montagne-Sainte-Geneviéve, [[Paris]], subsequently to become the official base of the Situationist International (but invariably referred to by both groups as "Rue de la Montagne-Geneviéve", signalling their disdain for religion). This was in fact the address of a bar, Tonneau d'Or, and indeed most of their time was spent either drinking in a number of bars in [[Saint-Germain-des-Prés]], principally at Chez Moineau on the Rue du Four, or else simply walking the streets.

There was a serious purpose behind their ambulation. They developed the '''[[dérive]]''', or drift, where they would wander like clouds through the urban environment for hours or sometimes even days on end. During their wanderings in the Summer of 1953, an "illiterate [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]]" suggested to them the term "[[Psychogeography]]", to designate what they saw as a pattern of emotive force-fields that would permeate a city. The dérive would enable them to map out these forces, and these results could then be used as a basis upon which to build a system of [[unitary urbanism]]. Among their most important texts on these matters were Debord's "Theory of the Dérive" (published in the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[surrealist]] magazine ''[[Les Lèvres Nues]]'', no. 9, November 1956), and [[Ivan Chtcheglov]]'s "Formulary for a New Urbanism" (written October 1953, but not published until June 1958 in the first issue of the journal ''[[Situationist International|Internationale Situationniste]]''). In the latter, Chtcheglov advocated a new city where, as he wrote, "each person will live in his own personal 'cathedral'. There will be rooms that produce dreams better than drugs, and houses where it will be impossible to do anything but love." He declared, "[[The Haçienda|The Hacienda]] must be built", a remark which would later inspire the name of the famous [[Manchester]] night-club. In "Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography" (''[[Les Lèvres Nues]]'', no. 6, September 1955), Debord described a colleague's drift through the [[Harz]] region of [[Germany]], blindly following a map of [[London]]. This is still a favourite methodology amongst [[psychogeographers]]. They produced a broad range of proposals: the abolition of museums and the placing of art in bars, keeping the [[rapid transit|Metro]] open all night, opening the roofs of Paris like pavements with escalators to help gain access.

Another important notion developed by the LI, was that of '''[[détournement]]''', a technique of reutilising plagiarised material (literary, artistic, cinematic, etc.) for a new and usually radical purpose. The defining LI text here was the 1956 "A User's Guide to Détournement", by Debord and Wolman, from ''Les Lèvres Nues'' no. 8. They argued: "In truth, it is necessary to do away with the whole notion of personal property in this area. The emergence of new demands renders earlier 'great works' obsolete. They become obstacles, bad habits. It is not a question of whether we like them or not. We must pass them by."&lt;ref name="nues8"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sami.is.free.fr/Oeuvres/debord_wolman_mode_emploi_detournement.html |title=Mode d'emploi du détournement |last1=Debord |first1=Guy-Ernest |last2=Wolman |first2=Gil J. |date=May 1956 |language=French |publisher=biblioteque-virtuelle |quote=A vrai dire, il faut en finir avec toute notion de propriété personnelle en cette matière. Le surgissement d'autres nécessités rend caduques les réalisations 'géniales' précédentes. Elles deviennent des obstacles, de redoutables habitudes. La question n'est pas de savoir si nous sommes ou non portés à les aimer. Nous devons passer outre. |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques were subsequently used extensively by the Situationists. In addition, such characteristically situationist concepts as the construction of situations and the supersession of art were first developed by the LI.

In addition to the central Parisian group, an [[Algeria]]n section of the LI was established in April 1953 by Hadj Mohamed Dahou, Cheik Ben Dhine and Ait Diafer. Based at [[Chlef|Orléansville]] ('the most letterist city in the world' according to ''Potlatch'' no. 12), they were hit hard by an earthquake there on 9 September 1954, although initial reports that most of them had been killed turned out to be unfounded (''Potlatch'' no. 13). A [[Switzerland|Swiss]] section was also established in late 1954, but were almost immediately excluded (''Potlatch'' no. 15).

In September 1956, Wolman represented the LI at the [[World Congress of Artists]] in [[Alba Docilia|Alba]], [[Italy]]. This conference had been organised by [[Asger Jorn]] and [[Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio|Pinot-Gallizio]] of the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]] (IMIB), and important links between the two groups were consolidated. Wolman himself was excluded from the LI shortly afterwards, but the remaining members, Debord and [[Michèle Bernstein]], subsequently visited [[Cosio d'Arroscia]] where, on 28 July 1957, the LI officially fused with the IMIB and the [[London Psychogeographical Association]] to form the Situationist International.

==Adventures==
Besides the Charlie Chaplin protest, some of the more noteworthy/startling activities of the LI include:

* Ivan Chtcheglov's plan to blow up the [[Eiffel Tower]], on no other grounds than that its lights were shining through his bedroom window and keeping him awake at night. He was subsequently confined to a mental institution.
* Debord's legendary 1953 graffito, "Ne travaillez jamais!" ("Never work!"), inscribed on a wall at the corner of the Rue de Mazarine and Rue de Seine. The slogan would later reappear in May 1968, and summed up the ethos of both the LI and the Situationist International after them.

Although pre-dating the formation of the LI (but directly involving Serge Berna, and inspiring the others), one might also mention:

* A 1950 letterist attempt at the liberation of a Catholic orphanage at [[Auteuil-Neuilly-Passy|Auteuil]], causing a small-scale riot in protest at how "youth suffers in slavery, or is super-exploited by the seniority system."
* The [[Notre-Dame Affair]] of Easter Sunday, 1950, where [[Michel Mourre]], dressed in a Dominican's habit, took to the pulpit and began to address the congregation, informing them, before anyone realised that anything was amiss, that God was dead, and that the Catholic Church was "appropriating our life force in the name of an empty heaven", and "infecting the world with its morality of death".

An extract from a letter of Gil Wolman to Jean-Louis Brau, of 20 July 1953, gives a clear impression of what the group and their associates tended to get up to from day to day:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am back! ... Where were things when you left? Joël [Berlé] has been out for a long time, on probation. Jean-Michel [Mension] and Fred [Auguste Hommel]  are now free, too (for stealing from parked cars—and under the influence, naturally). Little Eliane [Papaï] got out of police custody last week after a dramatic arrest in a maid's room somewhere in Vincennes with Joël and Jean-Michel; they were drunk, needless to say, and refused to open up to the police, who left and came back with reinforcements. In the confusion they lost the seal of the Letterist International. Linda [Fried] not sentenced yet. Sarah [Abouaf] still in the reformatory—but her sister, sixteen and a half, has taken her place. There have been other arrests, for narcotics, for who knows what else. It's getting very tiresome. There is G[uy]-E[rnest Debord], who has just spent ten days in a nursing home where his parents sent him following a failed attempt to gas himself. He's back in the neighbourhood now. Serge [Berna?] is due out on 12 May. The day before yesterday I threw up royally outside Moineau's. The latest diversion in the neighbourhood is spending the night in the [[Catacombs of Paris|Catacombs]]—another of Joël's bright ideas. I have a good many projects which are liable to remain just that—projects. ...&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Mension, ''The Tribe'', p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Decades later, Debord would nostalgically (though also somewhat ambiguously) sum up the spirit of the times in his ''[[Panegyric]]'' (1989): "Between the rue du Four and the rue de Buci, where our youth so completely went astray as a few glasses were drunk, one could feel certain that we would never do any better."

==Membership==
* [[Guy Debord]] (1931–1994) (generally using the name 'Guy-Ernest' during this period).
* [[Gil J. Wolman]] (1929–1995). Excluded 1957.
* [[Michèle Bernstein]] (1932–). Joined 1954.
* [[Alexander Trocchi]] (1925–1984). Joined 1955.
* [[Hadj Mohamed Dahou]] Joined 1953.
* [[Ivan Chtcheglov]] (1933–98) (known as "Gilles Ivain"). Excluded 1954.
* [[Serge Berna]] (1925?–?). Excluded 1953.
* [[Patrick Straram]] (1934–84). Joined 1953, quit 1954.
* [[Jean-Michel Mension]]. (1934–2006). Excluded 1954.
* [[Jean-Louis Brau]] (1930–?) (known as "Bull Dog Brau"). Excluded 1953.

Several others also passed through the LI during its five years of existence, including André-Frank Conord, Jacques Fillon, Abdelhafid Khatib, Henry de Béarn and Gaëtan M. Langlais. In addition, the central members (almost all of them men), would sometimes include their girlfriends' names (usually first names only) among the signatories to their texts. Worthy of special mention among these girlfriends is [[Eliane Papaï]] (1935–?). An alumna of the same Auteuil orphanage the letterists had attempted to liberate, she was first the girlfriend of Debord, then the wife of Mension, and finally the wife of Brau. Debord recalled her fondly in many of his later films and writings, and she herself (as [[Eliane Brau]]) produced a book on the Situationists in 1968, ''Le situationnisme ou la nouvelle internationale''.

Jean-Louis Brau, Gil Wolman and [[François Dufrêne]] founded a Second Letterist International (''D.I.L.'', ''Deuxième Internationale Lettriste'') in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Figures de la négation'' ([[Musée D'Art Moderne, Saint-Etienne Métropole]], 2004), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Lettrist International]] was founded more recently and is independent of (though inspired by) the earlier group.

==Publications==
The LI published four issues of the ''[[Internationale Lettriste]]'' bulletin between 1952 and 1954, followed by twenty eight issues of ''[[Potlatch]]'' from 1954 to 1957. A further two issues of ''Potlatch'' appeared in November 1957 and July 1959, now with the revised subtitle "Information bulletin of the Situationist International". Each issue comprised between one and four [[mimeograph]]ed sheets. ''[[Les Lèvres Nues]]'', though not an LI publication, published some of their most important articles. All of these texts, together with a few other miscellaneous tracts, are reprinted in ''Documents Relatifs A La Fondation De L'Internationale Situationniste'' (Editions Allia, 1985).

Debord's 1959 collaboration with Asger Jorn, ''Mémoires'', was directly concerned with the early days of the LI. The new Gallimard edition of his ''Oeuvres'' gathers many LI texts, including some never before published. Michèle Bernstein's novels, ''Tous les chevaux du roi'' (1960) and ''La Nuit'' (1961), present fictionalised accounts of her life with Debord during this period. Patrick Straram's ''Les bouteilles se couchent'' was a semi-fictionalised contemporary account of the scene, written in 1953 but lost until recently: it was published by Editions Allia in 2006. Also recently published by the same house are a biography of Ivan Chtcheglov and a separate collection of his writings. In October 2010, an unpublished text from the LI has just been released that recalls the adventures of the letterists between 1945 and February 1953 : ''Visages de l'avant-garde'' (Paris: Jean-Paul Rocher, éditeur, 2010).

The names of the communes used by Boyer are given at the right side of the "|" (e.g. "Charenton" in [[Charenton-le-Pont|Charenton]]), thus offering the possibility for other users to countercheck my associations with location names at Wikipedia. --&gt;
The '''list of medieval bridges in France''' comprises all bridges built between 500 and 1500 AD in what is today France, that is including regions which were not part of [[France in the Middle Ages|the country in the Middle Ages]], such as [[Burgundy (historical region)|Burgundy]], [[Alsace]], [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] and [[Savoie]]. Along with those [[Roman bridge]]s which remained in service throughout the period, there are in total over 700 structures known.

The '''Marble Throne''' ({{lang-fa|{{nq|تخت مرمر}}}} ''Taxt e Marmar'') is a 250-year-old royal [[throne]] in [[Golestan Palace#Marble Throne (Takht e Marmar)|Golestan Palace]], [[Tehran]], [[Iran]].

The throne was built from 1747 to 1751. It was designed by Mirza Baba Shirazi (Naqqash Bashi) and royal [[Stonemasonry|stonecutter]], Mohammad Ebrahim Esfahani. It consists of 65 marble stone pieces from a mine in [[Yazd]]. The throne's supports are carved in the shape of men, women, fairies, and demons.

The Royal Balcony of the Marble Throne is said to be built during the reign of [[Karim Khan Zand]], but Karim khan is known to have even refused the title king, and preferred to sit on a carpet rather than a throne so his ownership of the Marble throne is unlikely. It was changed several times during the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] period. The twin stone columns of the balcony were transferred to Tehran, by the order of [[Agha Mohammad Khan]], from [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]].

The [[Sun Throne]] was probably modelled after it.

'''Mireille Delisme''', (also known by her commercial artist name, '''Mireille Delice'''), is a Haitian [[Haitian Vodou art#Drapo|drapo Vodou]] artist from [[Léogâne]], Haiti.

== Biography ==
Delisme’s career began in 1986, when taught sewing and beading techniques by her cousin, named either [[Myrlande Constant]] or Yolande Ceauston.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://repeatingislands.com/2011/07/11/haitian-vodou-flags-featured-at-folk-art-market/|title=Haitian vodou flags featured at Folk Art Market|date=2011-07-11|work=Repeating Islands|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, she began working alongside her cousin in [[Port-au-Prince]] at a factory embellishing wedding dresses for export. Following the closing of the factory in 1990 due to political and economic issues, Delisme recalls having a dream in which she was visited by the spirits. When relating the dream to her father, an oungan (vodou priest), he interpreted the message to be from the vodou spirit or lwa named [[Erzulie]]. Erzulie, the spirit of love, is represented in vodou tradition by a heart, which was the same design symbolized in Delisme’s dream. Using beads left over from her time at the factory, the heart symbol visualized in her dream became the sequin design for her first drapo (flag).

Delisme recollects having more than one dream in which spirits visited her. During the third dream, she was delivered the message that, “I did not have to work in the factory, but I could learn to work for myself and earn for my family.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.handeyemagazine.com/content/spangled-banner|title=Spangled Banner|work=HandEye|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, having lost her job at the factory in conjunction with the lwa messages, Delisme decided to begin her life as an independent artist at age 25. Delisme continued to master her needlework skills by creating more drapo, finding design inspiration from her dreams and vodou symbols given to her by her father. Much of Delisme’s beadwork incorporates designs that represent traditional Vodou deities and are used to explain divinity and give clarity to life’s expressions and meanings. Her flags represent her spirituality and are used for guidance, wisdom, and healing. Her bright color combinations within the sequins and beads add to the mood and spirit of each piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.folkartmarket.org/artist/mireille-delisme/|title=Mireille Delisme - International Folk Art Market|website=www.folkartmarket.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since becoming an independent artist, Delisme has built an atelier in Haiti. The workshop was constructed to more efficiently assemble the bead-work for her drapo designs. Delisme describes the envisioned designs to a paid artist to be drawn or traced for the drapo and once done, is passed on to be beaded by Delisme herself or one of her seven employed artists at the workshop.

In January 2010, Delisme’s hometown was at the epicenter of a massive earthquake. Delisme and her family were among those affected by the earthquakes destruction. Although her home and workshop in the capital were safe, 18 miles away, Delisme stated, “I felt I had to express the disaster in Haiti in my artwork."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the country’s recovery, the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]]—in collaboration with the people of Haiti, several national and international agencies, and the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities—coordinated the 2010 [https://festival.si.edu Folklife Festival]. The festival was an effort to salvage, restore, and safeguard art treasures damaged or endangered by the earthquake. Several artists, including Delisme, participated in the event by demonstrating and selling their artwork in the Festival Marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://festival.si.edu/2010/a-tribute-to-haiti/smithsonian|title=A Tribute to Haiti {{!}} Smithsonian Folklife Festival|work=Smithsonian Folklife Festival|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Delisme’s work [http://indigoarts.com/catastrophe-de-12-janvier Catastrophe du 12 Janvier], a vodou flag created to depict the crumpled buildings and the bodies of the dead caused by the earthquake, was part of an annual exhibit at the [[Museum of International Folk Art]] titled “[http://www.internationalfolkart.org/exhibition/1056/the-arts-of-survival-folk-expression-in-the-face-of-natural-disaster The Arts of Survival: Folk Expression in the Face of Natural Disaster].” The exhibit explored how folk artists helped their communities recover from four natural disasters that occurred around 2011: The [[2010 Haiti earthquake|Haitian Earthquake]], [[Hurricane Katrina]], [[2010 Pakistan floods|Pakistani floods]], and the [[Mount Merapi|Mt. Merapi]] volcanic explosion in Indonesia. Also part of International Folk Arts Week, Delisme sold more of her pieces at her booth during the [[Santa Fe International Folk Art Market|Santa Fe International Folk Arts Market]]. She said she shipped about 160 flags and carried more in her suitcase in preparation for the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://media.newmexicoculture.org/press_releases.php?action=detail&amp;releaseID=155|title=The Arts of Survival: Folk Expression in the Face of Natural Disaster ::  Department of Cultural Affairs Media Center :: Press Releases|website=media.newmexicoculture.org|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oilpastel.JPG|thumb|300px|Oil pastel sticks in a box]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:mop3.JPG|thumb|250px|A box of [[commercial]] oil pastels]] --&gt;
'''Oil pastel''' (also called '''wax oil crayon''') is a painting and drawing medium with characteristics similar to [[pastel]]s and wax [[crayon]]s. Unlike "soft" or "Japanese" pastel sticks, which are made with a gum or [[methyl cellulose]] binder, oil pastels consist of [[pigment]] mixed with a non-drying oil and wax binder. The surface of an oil pastel painting is therefore less powdery, but more difficult to protect with a [[fixative (drawing)|fixative]]. Oil pastels provide a harder edge than "soft" or "French" pastels but are more difficult to blend. 

==History==
[[Image:Oil pastel portrait of a child.JPG|thumb|350px|Portrait of a child made from oil pastels.]]At the end of [[World War I]], [[Kanae Yamamoto (artist)|Kanae Yamamoto]] proposed an overhaul of the [[Japan]]ese education system. He thought that it had been geared too much towards uncritical absorption of information by imitation and wanted to promote a less restraining system, a vision he expounded in his book ''Theory of self-expression'' which described the ''Jiyu-ga'' method, "learning without a teacher". Teachers Rinzo Satake and his brother-in-law Shuku Sasaki read Yamamoto's work and became fanatical supporters. They became keen to implement his ideas by replacing the many hours Japanese children had to spend drawing [[ideogram]]s with black [[Indian ink]] with free drawing hours, filled with as much color as possible. For this, they decided to produce an improved wax crayon and in 1921 founded the  ''[[Sakura Color Products|Sakura Cray-Pas Company]]'' and began production. The new product wasn't completely satisfactory, pigment concentration was low and blending or impasto was impossible, so in 1924 they decided to develop a high viscosity crayon: the oil pastel. This used a mixture of mashed [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]], [[stearic acid]] and [[coconut oil]] as a [[Binder (material)|binder]]. Designed as a relatively cheap, easily applied, colorful medium, oil pastels granted younger artists and students a greater freedom of expression than the expensive chalk-like [[pastels]] normally associated with the fine arts. Until the addition of a stabiliser in 1927, oil pastels came in two types: winter pastels with additional oil to prevent hardening and summer pastels with little oil to avoid melting. [[State school]]s simply couldn't afford the medium and, suspicious of the very idea of "self-expression" in general, favoured the [[coloured pencil]], a cheaper German invention then widely promoted in Europe as a means to instill [[work ethic|work discipline]] in young children.

Oil pastels were an immediate commercial success and other manufacturers were quick to take up the idea, such as Dutch company ''Talens'', who began to produce Panda Pastels in 1930. However, none of these were comparable to the professional quality oil pastels produced today. These early products were intended to introduce [[Western world|west]]ern [[art education]] to Japanese children, and not as a fine arts medium, although Sakura managed to persuade some avant-garde artists to acquaint themselves with the technique, among them [[Pablo Picasso]]. In 1947 Picasso, who for many years had been unable to procure oil pastels because of the [[World War II|war condition]]s, convinced [[Henri Sennelier]], a French manufacturer who specialized in high quality art products, to develop a fine arts version. In 1949 [[Sennelier]] produced the first oil pastels intended for professionals and experienced artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These were superior in wax viscosity, texture and pigment quality and capable of producing more consistent and attractive work. The Japanese ''Holbein'' brand of oil pastel appeared in the mid-1980s with both student and professional grades; the latter with a range of 225 colours. Another brand, Caran d'Ache, introduced [[Neocolor]] wax crayons onto the market in 1965, using a patented [[polyethylene]] wax with superior [[lubrication]]; in the nineties these were developed into an oil pastel, [[Neopastel]].

==Use==
Oil pastels can be used directly in dry form; when done lightly, the resulting effects are similar to oil paints. Heavy build-ups can create an almost [[impasto]] effect. Once applied to a surface, the oil pastel pigment can be manipulated with a brush moistened in [[white spirit]], [[turpentine]], [[linseed oil]], or another type of [[vegetable oil]] or [[solvent]]. Alternatively, the drawing surface can be oiled before drawing or the pastel itself can be dipped in oil. Some of these solvents pose serious health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baylor.edu/ehs/index.php?id=94372|title=Section 10: Painting and Drawing|website=Environmental Health &amp; Safety {{!}} Baylor University|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil pastels are considered a fast medium because they are easy to paint with and convenient to carry; for this reason they are often used for sketching, but can also be used for sustained works. Because oil pastels never dry out completely, they need to be protected somehow, often by applying a special [[fixative (drawing)|fixative]] to the painting or placing the painting in a sleeve and then inside a frame. There are some known [[wikt:durability|durability]] problems: firstly, as the oil doesn't dry, it keeps permeating the paper. This process degrades both the paper and the colour layer as it reduces the flexibility of the latter. A second problem is that the stearic acid makes the paper brittle. Lastly both the stearic acid and the wax will be prone to [[efflorescence]] or "wax bloom", the building-up of fatty acids and wax on the surface into an opaque white layer. This is easily made transparent again by gentle polishing with a woolen cloth; but the three effects together result in a colour layer consisting mainly of brittle stearic acid on top of brittle paper, a combination that will crumble easily. A long term concern is simple [[evaporation]]: [[palmitic acid]] is often present and half of it will have evaporated within 40 years; within 140 years half of the stearic acid will have disappeared. Impregnation of the entire art work by [[beeswax]] has been evaluated as a [[Art conservation|conservation]] measure.

==Surface and techniques==

[[Image:Example Scraping Oil pastel.JPG|thumb|150px|An example of the ''scraping down'' technique.]]The surface chosen for oil pastels can have a very dramatic effect on the final painting. Paper is a common surface but this medium can be used on other surfaces including wood, metal, hardboard (often known as "masonite"), [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]], canvas and glass. Many companies make papers specifically for pastels that are suitable for use with oil pastels.

Building up layers of color with the oil pastel, called ''[[Layering (painting)|layering]]'', is a very common technique. Other techniques include ''[[underpainting]]'' and ''scraping down'' or [[sgraffito]]. Turpentine, or similar liquids such as [[mineral spirits]], are often used as a blending tool to create a [[wash (visual arts)|wash]] effect similar to some watercolor paintings. Commercially available oil sketching papers are preferred for such technique.

==Brands==

[[Image:Blended Oil pastel.JPG|thumb|150px|A blended picture using mineral spirits and oil pastels.]]There are a number of types of oil pastels, each of which can be classified as either ''scholastic'', ''student'' or ''professional'' grade.

''Scholastic grade'', for example the Loew Cornell brand, is the lowest grade: generally the oil pastels are harder and less vibrant than higher grades. It is generally meant for children or people starting out with oil pastels, and is fairly cheap compared to other grades, often about [[US$]]5 for a large box. The middle grade, ''student grade'', is meant for art students and can be much more expensive but softer and more vibrant than scholastic grade. They are usually more expensive and cost around $1 to $2 each. An example of a student grade oil pastel is ''Van Gogh'', manufactured by Talens. ''Professional grade'' is the highest grade of oil pastel and can be very expensive, often costing $3 to $5 per oil pastel, but are also the softest and most vibrant. Professional quality brands of oil pastel include Sennelier, Holbein, Garich, and Sakura Specialist.

The '''Hallam Company''', which later became the '''American Company''' and then the '''Old American Company''',{{cn|date=February 2013}} was the first fully professional theatre company to perform in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Michael A. ''Shakespeare in North America'' in Wells, Stanley and Stanton, Sarah ''The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Stage'' (Cambridge University Press, 2002) pp.230-232&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was organised by [[William Hallam (theatre manager)|William Hallam]], former proprietor of the New Wells Theatre in London, and was led by his brother [[Lewis Hallam]]. Their company consisted of 12 adults and 3 children, drawn from English actors of "modest accomplishment". They arrived by the vessel ''Charming Sally'' at Yorktown, Virginia, on 2 June 1752, and made their early performances in nearby Williamsburg. Their first performance, ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', is generally considered to be the first professional staging of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] in America.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, p.230&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1753 the Hallam company moved to New York, and in 1754 they played in Philadelphia and in Charleston, South Carolina. In 1755 the company moved to the West Indies, and merged with the company of [[David Douglass (actor)|David Douglass]]. On Lewis' death, Douglass married his widow [[Sarah Hallam Douglass]]. Three years later, the company returned to tour the mainland, as the "American Company".&lt;ref name="Morrison, p.231"&gt;Morrison, p.231&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis' son, [[Lewis Hallam, Jr.]], eighteen at the time of the American Company's first tour, took leading roles alongside Douglass. Lewis Jr.'s style was described as declaratory rather than realistic, but he was much admired and became known as America's leading Shakespearean interpreter.&lt;ref name="Morrison, p.231"/&gt; Douglass had his limitations: one Alexander Graydon described him as "rather a decent than shining actor". However, he was a capable manager and he gave North America its first [[Falstaff]] and [[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]. Within the repertoire was ''[[Cymbeline]]'', which proved a popular vehicle for two of the company's actresses, [[Margaret Cheer]] and [[Nancy Hallam]].&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, pp.231-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In Quaker and Puritan areas, the company encountered religious opposition to theatre in general. At Rhode Island in 1761 they were obliged to perform Othello disguised as "a series of moral dialogues".&lt;ref name="Morrison, p.232"&gt;Morrison, p.232&lt;/ref&gt; In 1774, the [[Continental Congress]] banned theatre entirely, and the company resettled in Jamaica. By that time, Hugh F. Ranking calculates that the company had performed at least 180 times, their repertoire having included fourteen of Shakespeare's plays. After the peace of 1783, the company returned to New York, with Lewis Hallam Jr. as the leading actor, and [[John Henry (actor)|John Henry]] as his co-manager.&lt;ref name="Morrison, p.232"/&gt; 

Lewis Jr. is believed to be the first actor in America to perform in [[blackface]] in 1769.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tosches |first= Nick |title= Where Dead Voices Gather |publisher= Back Bay |year= 2002 |isbn= 0-316-89537-7 |page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==

In November 1766, when the [[Southwark Theatre in Philadelphia]] opened, the American Company had the following members:
* Adam Allyn
* [[Margaret Cheer]]
* David Douglass
* Mrs. Douglass
* Miss Dowthwaite
* James Godwin
* [[Lewis Hallam Jr.]]
* Mrs. Harmon
* Mr. Mathews
* Owen Morris
* Mary Morris
* Mr. Tomlinson
* Anna Tomlinson
* Miss Wainwright
* Thomas Wall
* [[Stephen Woolls]]

By October 1767, new members were:
* Patrick Malone
* Mr. Roberts
* [[John Henry (actor)|John Henry]]
* Ms. Storers (more than one)

In 1792, [[John Hodgkinson (actor, born 1766)|John Hodgkinson]] joined.

Other members included [[Thomas Wignell]] and [[Joseph Harper (actor)|Joseph Harper]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5027">{{distinguish|The Old Wives' Tale (play)}}
An '''old wives' tale''' is a supposed truth which is actually spurious or a superstition. It can be said sometimes to be a type of [[urban legend]], said to be passed down by older women to a younger generation. Such tales are considered [[superstition]], [[folklore]] or unverified claims with exaggerated and/or inaccurate details. Old wives' tales often center on women's traditional concerns, such as [[pregnancy]], [[puberty]], [[social relations]], [[health]], [[herbalism]] and [[nutrition]].

== Origins ==
In this context, the word ''wife'' means "woman" rather than "married woman". This usage stems from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|{{wt|ang|wif}}}}'' ("woman") and is akin to the [[German language|German]] ''{{linktext|Weib|lang=de}}'' (also meaning "woman"). This sense of the word is still used in [[Modern English]] in constructions such as ''[[midwife]]'' and ''[[fishwife]]''.

Old wives' tales are often invoked to discourage certain behaviors, usually of children, or to share knowledge of [[traditional medicine|folk cures]] for ailments ranging from [[toothaches]] to [[dysentery]].

The concept of old wives' tales has existed for centuries. In 1611, the [[King James Bible]] was published with the following translation of the [[Apostle Paul]] writing to his young protégé [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]], "But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself [rather] unto godliness" ([[I Timothy]] 4:7 [[KJV]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=1Ti&amp;c=4&amp;v=7&amp;t=KJV#7|title=1 Timothy 4:7 (KJV)|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== The oral tradition ===

Old wives' tales originate in the oral tradition of storytelling. They were generally propagated by illiterate women, telling stories to each other or to children. The stories do not attempt to moralise, but to teach lessons and make difficult concepts like death or [[coming of age]] easy for children to understand. These stories are also used to scare children so they don't do certain things.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', 15 May 2010, Greer, Germaine. "Grandmother's footsteps" http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/may/15/germaine-greer-old-wives-tales&lt;/ref&gt;

These tales have often been collected by literate men, and turned into written works. Fairy tales by [[Giambattista Basile|Basile]], [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]], and the [[Brothers Grimm|Grimms]] have their roots in the oral tradition of women. These male writers took the stories from women, with their plucky, clever heroines and heroes, and turned them into [[morality tale]]s for children.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, Jack. ''The Trials and Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood'', Routledge, 1993 {{ISBN|0-415-90834-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of old wives' tales ==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}

{{Culture of the Ottoman Empire}}
'''Ottoman miniature''' or '''Turkish miniature''' was an art form in the [[Ottoman Empire]], which can be linked to the [[Persian miniature]] tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Figurative Art in Medieval Islam, Michael Barry, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; as well as strong Chinese artistic influences. It was a part of the Ottoman book arts, together with [[Ottoman illumination|illumination]] (''tezhip''), [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]] (''hat''), [[Paper marbling|marbling paper]] (''ebru''), and bookbinding (''cilt''). The words ''taswir'' or ''nakish'' were used to define the art of miniature painting in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. The studios the artists worked in were called Nakkashanes.

==Original procedure==
The miniatures were usually not signed, perhaps because of the rejection of individualism, but also because the works were not created entirely by one person{{sfn|Aybey|1979|p=43}}; the head painter designed the composition of the scene, and his apprentices drew the contours (which were called ''tahrir'') with black or colored ink and then painted the miniature without creating an illusion of third dimension. The head painter, and much more often the scribe of the text, were indeed named and depicted in some of the manuscripts. The understanding of perspective was different from that of the nearby European [[Renaissance painting]] tradition, and the scene depicted often included different time periods and spaces in one picture. The miniatures followed closely the context of the book they were included in, resembling more illustrations rather than standalone works of art.

The colors for the miniature were obtained by ground powder pigments mixed with egg-white &lt;ref name=TCF&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and, later, with diluted gum arabic. The produced colors were vivid. Contrasting colors used side by side with warm colors further emphasized this quality. The most used colors in Ottoman miniatures were bright red, scarlet, green, and different shades of blue.

The worldview underlying the Ottoman miniature painting was also different from that of the European Renaissance tradition. The painters did not mainly aim to depict the human beings and other living or non-living beings realistically, although increasing realism is found from the later 16th century and onwards. Like [[Plato]], Ottoman tradition tended to reject [[mimesis]], because according to the worldview of [[Sufism]] (a mystical form of Islam widespread at the popular level in the Ottoman Empire), the appearance of worldly beings was not permanent and worth devoting effort to, resulting in stylized and abstracted illustrations.

==History and development==

===Origin===
[[File:Ottoman Dynasty, Portrait of a Painter, Reign of Mehmet II (1444-1481).jpg|thumb|250px|Portrait of a painter during the reign of Mehmet II]]

During the reign of [[Mehmed II]], a court workshop called ''Nakkashane-i Rum'' that also functioned as an academy was founded in [[Topkapı Palace]] in [[Istanbul]] to create illuminated picture manuscripts for the [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]] and the courtiers.

At the beginning of the 16th century, the [[Herat]] workshop of [[Persian miniature|Persian miniaturists]] was closed, and its famous instructor [[Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād|Behzad]] (or Bihzad) went to [[Tabriz]]. After the Ottoman emperor [[Selim I]] briefly conquered Tabriz in 1514, taking many manuscripts back to Istanbul, the "Nakkashane-i Irani" (The Persian Academy of Painting) was founded in Topkapı Palace for imported Persian artists. The artists of these two painting academies formed two different schools of painting: The artists in ''Nakkashane-i Rum'' were specialized in documentary books, like the ''Shehinshahname'', showing the public, and to some extent the private, lives of rulers, their portraits and historical events; Shemaili Ali Osman—portraits of rulers; ''Surname''—pictures depicting weddings and especially circumcision festivities; Shecaatname-wars commanded by pashas. The artists in ''Nakkashanei-i Irani'' specialized in traditional Persian poetic works, like the ''[[Shahnameh]]'', the ''[[Khamsa of Nizami]]'', containing ''[[Layla and Majnun]]'' and the ''Iskendername'' or ''Romance of Alexander'', Humayunname, animal fables, and anthologies. There were also scientific books on botany and animals, alchemy, cosmography, and medicine; technical books; love letters; books about astrology; and dream reading.

===Golden age===
The reigns of [[Suleyman the Magnificent]] (1520–1566) and especially [[Selim II]] (1566–1574) in the second half of the 16th century were the golden age of the Ottoman miniature, with its own characteristics and authentic qualities. [[Nakkaş Osman]] (often known as Osman the Miniaturist) was the most important miniature painter of the period, while Nigari developed portrait painting.

[[Matrakçı Nasuh]] was a famous miniature painter during the reigns of [[Selim I]] and [[Suleyman the Magnificent]]. He created a new painting genre called topographic painting. He painted cities, ports, and castles without any human figures and combined scenes observed from different viewpoints in one picture.

During the reigns of Selim II (1566–1574) and [[Murat III]] (1574–1595), the classical Ottoman miniature style was created. The renowned miniature painters of the period were Nakkaş Osman, Ali Çelebi, Molla Kasım, Hasan Pasha, and Lütfi Abdullah.

===Start of being seen as art rather than function===
By the end of the 16th century and in the beginning of the 17th century, especially during the reign of [[Ahmed I]], single page miniatures intended to be collected in albums or ''[[muraqqa|murakkas]]'' were popular. They had existed at the time of Murat III, who ordered an album of them from the painter Velijan. In the 17th century, miniature painting was also popular among the citizens of Istanbul. Artists under the name of "Bazaar Painters" ({{lang-tr|Çarşı Ressamları}}) worked with other artisans in the bazaars of Istanbul at the demand of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;A definition made by Metin And, in ''17. Yüzyıl Türk çarşı ressamları''. Tarih ve Toplum, no. 16 (April 1985): pp. 40–44&lt;/ref&gt;

A new cultural genre known in Ottoman history as the [[Tulip period]] occurred during the reign of [[Ahmed III]]. Some art historians attribute the birth of the unique style called "Ottoman Baroque" to this period. The characteristics of the period carried the influences of French baroque. In this period, a grand festival for the circumcision rituals for the sons of Ahmed III was organized. Artisans, theatre groups, clowns, musicians, trapeze dancers, and citizens joined in the festivities. A book called [[Surname-I Hümayun|''Surname-i Vehbi'']] tells about this festival. This book was depicted by [[Abdulcelil Levni]] (the name ''Levni'' is related to the Arabic word levn ("color") and was given to the artist because of the colorful nature of his paintings) and his apprentices. His style of painting was influenced by Western painting and very different from the earlier miniature paintings.

===Losing its function===
After Levni, Westernization of Ottoman culture continued, and with the introduction of printing press and later photography, no more illuminated picture manuscripts were produced. From then on, wall paintings or oil paintings on toils were popular. The miniature painting thus lost its function.

===Contemporary Turkish miniature===
{{Main|Contemporary Turkish Miniature}}
After a period of crisis in the beginning of the 20th century, miniature painting was accepted as a "decorative art" by the intellectuals of the newly founded [[Persian miniature|Turkish Republic]], and in 1936, a division called "Turkish Decorative Arts" was established in the [[Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University|Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul]], which included miniature painting together with the other Ottoman book arts. The historian and author Süheyl Ünver educated many artists following the tradition of Ottoman book arts.

Contemporary miniature artists include Ömer Faruk Atabek, Sahin Inaloz, Cahide Keskiner, [[Gülbün Mesara]], Nur Nevin Akyazıcı, [[Ahmet Yakupoğlu]], [[Nusret Çolpan]], Orhan Dağlı, and many others from the new generation. Contemporary artists usually do not consider miniature painting as merely a "decorative art" but as a fine art form. Different from the traditional masters of the past, they work individually and sign their works. Also, their works are not illustrating books, as was the case with the original Ottoman miniatures, but being exhibited in fine art galleries.

It is not to be confused with the general context of the term "outline", which a summary or overview of a subject, presented verbally or written in prose&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]: "outline ''n.''3.a. In ''pl.'' The main features or general principles of a subject, proposal, etc. 3.b. A brief verbal or written description of something, giving a general idea of the whole but leaving details to be filled in; a draft, a summary. Also: a précis of a proposed article, novel, scenario, etc."&lt;/ref&gt; (for example, ''[[The Outline of History]]'' is not an outline of the type presented below). The outlines described in this article are lists, and come in several varieties.

A sentence outline is a tool for composing a document, such as an essay, a paper, a book, or even an encyclopedia. It is a list used to organize the facts or points to be covered, and their order of presentation, by section. Topic outlines list the subtopics of a subject, arranged in levels, and while they can be used to plan a composition, they are most often used as a summary, such as in the form of a table of contents or the topic list in a college course's syllabus.

Outlines are further differentiated by the index prefixing used, or lack thereof.  Many outlines include a numerical or alphanumerical prefix preceding each entry in the outline, to provide a specific path for each item, to aid in referring to and discussing the entries listed. An alphanumerical outline uses alternating letters and numbers to identify entries. A decimal outline uses only numbers as prefixes. An outline without prefixes is called a "bare outline".

Specialized applications of outlines also exist. A reverse outline is a list of sentences or topics that is created from an existing work, as a revision tool; it may show the gaps in the document's coverage so that they may be filled, and may help in rearranging sentences or topics to improve the structure and flow of the work. An integrated outline is a composition tool for writing scholastic works, in which the sources, and the writer's notes from the sources, are integrated into the outline for ease of reference during the writing process.

A software program designed for processing outlines is called an [[outliner]].

== Types of outlines ==

Outlines are differentiated by style, the inclusion of prefixes, and specialized purpose. There are also hand-written outlines (which are highly limited in utility), and digitized outlines, such as those contained within an [[outliner]] (which are much more useful).

=== By style ===

There are two main styles of outline: sentence outlines and topic outlines.

==== A sample topic outline application: An outline of human knowledge ====

 
[[Propædia]] is the historical attempt of the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] to present a hierarchical "Outline of Knowledge" in a separate volume in the 15th edition of 1974. The ''[[Outline of Knowledge]]'' was a project by [[Mortimer Adler]]. Propædia had three levels, 10 "Parts" at the top level, 41 "Divisions" at the middle level and 167 "Sections" at the bottom level, numbered, for example, "1. Matter and Energy", "1.1 Atoms", "1.1.1. Structure and Properties of Atoms".

=== By prefixing used ===

A feature included in many outlines is prefixing. Similar to [[section numbers]], an outline prefix is a label (usually alphanumeric or numeric) placed at the beginning of an outline entry to assist in referring to it.

==== Bare outlines ====

Bare outlines include no prefixes.

==== Alphanumeric outline ====

An ''alphanumeric outline'' includes a prefix at the beginning of each topic as a reference aid. The prefix is in the form of [[Roman numerals]] for the top level, [[Letter case|upper-case]] letters (in the alphabet of the language being used) for the next level, [[Arabic numerals]] for the next level, and then lowercase letters for the next level.  For further levels, the order is started over again.  Each numeral or letter is followed by a period, and each item is capitalized, as in the following sample:

{{Quotation|
'''Thesis statement''': E-mail and [[Internet surveillance|internet monitoring]], as currently practiced, is an invasion of employees' rights in the workplace.

:I. The situation: Over 80% of today's companies monitor their employees.
::A. To prevent fraudulent activities, theft, and other workplace related violations.
::B. To more efficiently monitor employee productivity.
::C. To prevent any legal liabilities due to harassing or offensive communications.
:II. What are employees' privacy rights when it comes to electronic monitoring and surveillance in the workplace?
::A. American employees have basically no legal protection from mean and snooping bosses.
:::1. There are no federal or State laws protecting employees.
:::2. Employees may assert privacy protection for their own personal effects.
::B. Most managers believe that there is no right to privacy in the workplace.
:::1. Workplace communications should be about work; anything else is a misuse of company equipment and company time
:::2. Employers have a right to prevent misuse by monitoring employee communications
}}

Some call the Roman numerals "A-heads" (for "A-level headings"), the upper-case letters, "B-heads", and so on. Some writers also prefer to insert a blank line between the A-heads and B-heads, while often keeping the B-heads and C-heads together.

If more levels of outline are needed, lower-case Roman numerals and numbers and lower-case letters, sometimes with single and double parenthesis can be used, although the exact order is not well defined, and usage varies widely.

The scheme recommended by the ''[[MLA Handbook]]'',&lt;ref name="MLA 2009"&gt;{{cite book|title=MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers |year=2009 |publisher=Modern Language Association of America |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-1-60329-024-1 |author=&lt;!--Staff writers; no by-line.--&gt; |edition=Seventh |page=45 |chapter=1.8.3: Final Outline }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Purdue Online Writing Lab]]'',&lt;ref name="Purdue"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/544/03/ |title=Developing an Outline |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=[[Purdue Online Writing Lab]] |year=2011 |publisher=[[Purdue University]] |location= |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others, uses the usual five levels, as described above, then repeats the Arabic numerals and lower-case letter surrounded by parentheses (round brackets)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; I. A. 1. a. i. (1) (a)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and does not specify any lower levels,&lt;ref name="MLA 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Purdue" /&gt; though "(i)" is usually next.  In common practice, lower levels yet are usually Arabic numerals and lowercase letters again, and sometimes lower-case Roman again, with single parentheses &amp;ndash; 1) a) i)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; but usage varies. MLA style is sometimes incorrectly referred to as APA style,&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite web |url= http://examples.yourdictionary.com/apa-outline-format-examples.html |title=APA Outline Format Examples |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=YourDictionary.com |year=2011 |accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ''[[Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association|APA Publication Manual]]'' does not address outline formatting at all.

A very different style recommended by ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'',&lt;ref name="Chicago 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago 2003"&gt;{{cite book |title=Chicago Manual of Style |author=&lt;!--Staff writers; no by-line.--&gt; |edition=15th |pages=270&amp;ndash;275 |chapter=Lists and Outline Style (6.124&amp;ndash;130) |publisher=U. of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, IL |year=2003 |isbn=0-226-10403-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the practice of the [[United States Congress]] in drafting legislation, suggests the following sequence, from the top to the seventh level (the only ones specified):  I. A. 1. ''a'') (1) (''a'') ''i'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; capital Roman numerals with a period, capital letters with a period, Arabic numerals with a period, italic lowercase letters with a single parenthesis, Arabic numerals with a double parenthesis, italic lowercase letters with a double parenthesis, and italic lowercase Roman numerals with a single parentheses, though the italics are not required).  Because of its use in the [[United States Code|US Code]] and other US law books, Many American [[lawyers]] consequently use this outline format.

Another alternative scheme repeats all five levels with a single parenthesis for the second five &amp;ndash; I) A) 1) a) i)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and then again with a double parenthesis for the third five&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; (I) (A) (1) (a) (i).{{citation needed|date=October 2011|reason=Not used in any source cited so far.}}

Many oft-cited style guides besides the ''APA Publication Manual'', including the ''[[Associated Press Stylebook|AP Stylebook]]'', the ''[[New York Times Manual|NYT Manual]]'', [[Fowler's Modern English Usage|Fowler]], ''[[The Guardian]]'' Style Guide, and [[The Elements of Style|Strunk &amp; White]], are curiously silent on the topic.

One side effect of the use of both Roman numerals and uppercase letters in all of these styles of outlining is that in most alphabets, "I." may be an item at both the top (A-head) and second (B-head) levels. This is usually not problematic because lower level items are usually referred to hierarchically. For example, the third sub-sub-item of the fourth sub-item of the second item is item II. D. 3.  So, the ninth sub-item (letter-I) of the first item (Roman-I) is item I. I., and only the top level one is item I.

==== Decimal outline ====

The ''decimal outline'' format has the advantage of showing how every item at every level relates to the whole, as shown in the following sample outline:

{{Quotation|
'''Thesis statement''': ---

:1.0 Introduction
::1.1 Brief history of Liz Claiborne
::1.2 Corporate environment
:2.0 Career opportunities
::2.1 Operations management
:::2.1.1 Traffic
:::2.1.2 International trade and corporate customs
:::2.1.3 Distribution
::2.2 Product development
}}

=== By specialized purpose ===

Special types of outlines include reverse outlines and integrated outlines.

==== Reverse outline ====

A ''reverse outline'' is an outline made from an existing work. Reverse outlining is like reverse engineering a document. The points or topics are extracted from the work, and are arranged in their order of presentation, by section, in the outline. Once completed, the outline can be filled in and rearranged as a plan for a new improved version of the document.

==== Integrated outline ====

An ''integrated outline'' is a helpful step in the process of organizing and writing a scholarly paper ([[literature review]], [[research]] paper, [[thesis]] or [[dissertation]]). When completed the integrated outline contains the relevant scholarly sources (author's last name, publication year, page number if quote) for each section in the outline. An integrated outline is generally prepared after the scholar has collected, read and mastered the literature that will be used in the research paper. Shields and Rangarajan (2013) recommend that new scholars develop a system to do this. Part of the system should contain a systematic way to take notes on the scholarly sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M. Shields|Shields, Patricia]] and Rangarjan, N. 2013. ''A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tVYbAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Patricia+M.+Shields%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c3iIU6X7HdOYyASjlIDwBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]. Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press. See Chapter 8 for a detailed discussion of an integrated outline with examples.&lt;/ref&gt; These notes can then be tied to the paper through the integrated outline. This way the scholar reviews all of the literature before the writing begins.

An integrated outline can be a helpful tool for people with [[writer's block]] because the content of the paper is organized and identified prior to writing. The structure and content is combined and the author can write a small section at a time. The process is less overwhelming because it can be separated into manageable chunks. The first draft can be written using smaller blocks of time.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia. 2014. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263861162_Tools_for_Writing_Excellent_Papers_2014_ASPA_Student_Summit Tools for Excellent Papers]: 2014 ASPA Student Summit. Presentation at the [[American Society for Public Administration]] annual conference, Washington DC March 15, This powerpoint describes a system for writing paper that contains an integrated outline. Slides 37 - 46 examine the components of an integrated outline with an example.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hand-written vs computerized ===

For a comparison, see [[#Outliners|Outliners]], below.

== Applications ==

Outlines are used for composition, summarization, and as a development and storage medium.

=== Composition ===

''Merriam-Webster's manual for writers and editors'' (1998, p.&amp;nbsp;290) recommends that the section headings of an article should when read in isolation, combine to form an outline of the article content. Garson (2002) distinguishes a 'standard outline', presented as a regular [[table of contents]] from a refined tree-like 'hierarchical outline', stating that "such an outline might be appropriate, for instance, when the purpose is taxonomic (placing observed phenomena into an exhaustive set of categories). ... hierarchical outlines are rare in quantitative writing, and the researcher is well advised to stick to the standard outline unless there are compelling reasons not to."&lt;ref&gt;G. David Garson, ''Guide to writing empirical papers, theses, and dissertations''. CRC Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-8247-0605-0}}, chapter "Typical Outlines", pp. 23-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers of [[fiction]] and [[creative nonfiction]], such as Jon Franklin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =Writing for Story|date = 1994|last = Franklin|first = Jonathan|publisher = Plume|isbn = 9780452272958}}&lt;/ref&gt; may use outlines to establish plot sequence, character development and dramatic flow of a story, sometimes in conjunction with [[free writing]].

Preparation of an outline is an intermediate step in the process of writing a scholarly [[research]] paper, [[literature review]], [[thesis]] or [[dissertation]]. A special kind of outline (integrated outline) incorporates scholarly sources into the outline before the writing begins.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia M. 2004.[http://store.newforums.com/STEP-by-STEP-Building-a-Research-Paper-SWB01.htm ''Step by Step: Building a Research Paper.''] Stillwater OK: New Forums Press. {{ISBN|1-58107-117-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Summarization ===

In addition to being used as a composition tool during the drafting process, outlines can also be used as a publishing format. Outlines can presented as work's table of contents, but they can also be used as the body of a work.  The ''[[Outline of Knowledge]]'' from the 15th edition of the ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' is an example of this. Wikipedia includes outlines that summarize subjects (for example, see [[Outline of chess]], [[Outline of Mars]], and [[Outline of knowledge]]).

Professors often hand out to their students at the beginning of a term, a summary of the subjects to be covered throughout the course in the form of a topic outline. It may also be included as part of a larger course synopsis.

Outlines are also used to summarize talking points for a speech or lecture.

=== Personal information management ===

Outlines, especially those used within an [[outliner]], can be used for planning, scheduling, and recording.

== Outliners ==
{{Main|Outliner}}

An [[outliner]] (or "outline processor") is a specialized type of [[word processor]] used to view, create, build, modify, and maintain outlines. It is a computer program, or part of one, used for displaying, organizing, and editing [[hierarchy|hierarchically]] arranged text in an outline's [[tree structure]]. Textual information is contained in discrete sections called "nodes", which are arranged according to their topic-subtopic (parent-child) relationships, sort of like the members of a [[family tree]]. When loaded into an outliner, an outline may be [[text folding|collapsed or expanded]] to display as few or as many levels as desired.

Outliners are used for storing and retrieving textual information, with terms, phrases, sentences, or paragraphs attached to a tree.  So rather than being arranged by document, information is arranged by topic or content. An outline in an outliner may contain as many topics as desired.  This eliminates the need to have separate documents, as outlines easily include other outlines just by adding to the tree.

The main difference between a hand-written outline and a digital one, is that the former is usually limited to a summary or blueprint of a planned document, while the latter may easily include all of the content of the entire document and many more.  In other words, as a hand-written work an outline is a writing tool, but on a computer, it is a general purpose format supported by a robust development and display medium capable of handling knowledge from its creation to its end use.

Outliners may be used in [[content creation]] instead of general word processors for capturing, organizing, editing, and displaying knowledge or general textual information. Outliners are ideal for managing lists, organizing facts and ideas, and for [[computer programming|writing computer programs]].  They are also used for goal and task management (including [[personal information management]] and [[project management]]), and for writing books and movie scripts.

The graphical counterpart to outliners are [[mind mapper]]s.

Bond was born in Canada and raised in Oregon.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://knowyourcity.org/2012/04/26/a-place-called-home-meet-rose-bond/|title = A Place Called Home: Meet Rose Bond|date = 26 April 2012|accessdate = 21 June 2015|website = Know Your City: Portland, Oregon|publisher = |last = Moscato|first = Marc|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150621232130/http://knowyourcity.org/2012/04/26/a-place-called-home-meet-rose-bond/|archivedate = 21 June 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; She reports that she had been drawing and recognized for her art since she was in kindergarten.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bond graduated from [[Portland State University]] (PSU) with a bachelor's degree in 1971 and later with a master's degree in education in 1976.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Bond struggled with making her creative visions a reality while she was in college, and believed that teaching art was the only way she could make a living.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Later, she received a masters of fine arts from the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] where she studied experimental film-making.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On September 18, 2001, Bond created and registered a business for her animations in Oregon under the name Rose Bond Moving Pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.perfectleads.com/company/14131923/Rose-Bond-Moving-Pictures|title = Rose Bond Moving Pictures|date = |accessdate = 21 June 2015|website = Perfect Leads|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Bond teaches at the [[Pacific Northwest College of Art]] (PNCA) in [[Portland, Oregon]], where she is an associate professor and a lead faculty in Animated Arts.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Re Defining Animation|last = |first = |publisher = USC School of Cinematic Arts|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Los Angeles|pages = 32|url = http://anim.usc.edu/sas2013/SAS_Program_2013.pdf|access-date = 23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Bond started out using traditional methods of creating animation with [[flip book|flipbooks]] and inking by hand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-02-28/features/8804020962_1_lesbian-kate-davis-stillborn-baby|title = Festival Offers Film 'Evidence'|last = Behrens|first = Leigh|date = 28 February 1988|work = The Chicago Tribune|access-date = 23 June 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later she began to experiment with using computers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She uses digital tablets, like those made by [[Wacom (company)|Wacom]], to teach her students at PNCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://portlandtribune.com/pt/239-business/255498-124441-wacom-gets-drawn-in|title = Wacom Gets Drawn In|last = Gallivan|first = Joseph|date = 31 March 2015|work = Portland Tribune|access-date = 20 June 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her current work is mainly public art featuring site-specific animations which use a combination of hand-drawn and digital art.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Sad Tale is Larger Than Life|last = Pitt|first = Sarah|date = 5 February 2010|work = Western Morning News (Plymouth, UK)|access-date = |via = Lexis Nexis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bond's earlier films deal with [[Feminism|feminist issues]], questioning whether one gender should rule over another through the medium of animated [[Irish mythology|Irish legends]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In these stories (''Deirdre's Choice, Macha's Curse and Cerridwen's Gift''), based on figures from Irish legends, Bond painted directly onto clear [[35 mm film]] to create the effect of animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=f5h&amp;AN=319332&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Videofile|last = Shearin|first = John W.|date = January 1998|journal = Emergency Librarian|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 21 June 2015|subscription = yes|volume = 25|issue = 3|page = 53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her hand-drawn and hand-painted images for these films were considered dramatic by reviewer, Wendy Jackson, who also felt that Bond's choice of heroines showed a "feminist sensibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.awn.com/animationworld/video-reviews|title = Video Reviews|date = 1 June 1997|accessdate = 21 June 2015|website = Animation World Network|publisher = |last = Jackson|first = Wendy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bond's first animation installation was staged in 2002 in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], using the historic Seamen's Bethel Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.inlander.com/spokane/public-exposure/Content?oid=2239794|title = Public Exposure|last = Sottile|first = Leah|date = 12 December 2013|work = Inlander|access-date = 21 June 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her installation work "challenges people to think about how they perceive time, space, and memory."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://kboo.fm/node/29706|title = Big Animation with Rose Bond and DripDrop|last = Roberts|first = Dmae|date = 12 July 2011|work = KBOO|access-date = 20 June 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = New Residents Get a Glimpse of Neighborhood's Past|last = Gerson|first = Daniela|date = 7 April 2004|work = The New York Sun|access-date = |via = Lexis Nexis}}&lt;/ref&gt; When beginning a new animation projection, Bond researches the history of the building and incorporates it into the projection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://torontoist.com/2011/09/the-nuit-blanche-curators-in-conversation/|title = The Nuit Blanche Curators, In Conversation|last = Maga|first = Carly|date = 26 September 2011|work = Torontoist|access-date = 20 June 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Windows Into History|last = Kleinman|first = Howard|date = 19 March 2004|work = The Forward|access-date = |via = Lexis Nexis}}&lt;/ref&gt; She visits each spot where she will be creating an installation, exploring the buildings and gleaning interesting historical facts to use in her animations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/ruined-refuge/Content?oid=14475211|title = Ruined Refuge|last = Streckert|first = Joe|date = 17 December 2014|work = The Portland Mercury|access-date = 21 June 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Broadsided!'', her animation commissioned by the Exeter Arts Council for Exeter Castle, Bond discovered the story of a man who was hung for stealing sheep which she uses in her animated story.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

One of her most shown installations, ''Intra Muros'' (2007), was shown at the first Platform Animation Festival in Portland and consists of projected animations in the windows that loop every eight minutes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; ''Intra Muros'' invites viewers to wonder what is going on in the spaces they cannot see.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Bond's installation, ''Gates of Light'', reached audiences that were not familiar with experimental film.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Bond's projected animations also have the unique capacity to turn the mundane building people see everyday into something special and to challenge with her work, a viewer's "sense of familiarity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Handbook of New Audiovisual Aesthetics|last = Perrott|first = Lisa|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2013|isbn = 9780199733866|location = New York|pages = 235|chapter = Zig Zag: Reanimating Len Lye as Improvised Theatrical Performance and Immersive Visual Music|editor-last = Richardson|editor-first = John|editor-last2 = Gorbman|editor-first2 = Claudia|editor-last3 = Vernallis|editor-first3 = Carol}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bond is excited about the potential for animation to change the "cultural landscape."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''Stephen Wiltshire''' {{post-nominals|list=[[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]], [[Society of Architectural Illustration|Hon.FSAI]], Hon.FSSAA}} (born 24 April 1974) is a British architectural artist and autistic savant.&lt;ref name=WiltshireBio&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.stephenwiltshire.co.uk/biography.aspx|title=Biography|publisher=The Stephen Wiltshire Gallery|accessdate=12 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his ability to [[Eidetic memory|draw from memory]] a landscape after seeing it just once. His work has gained worldwide popularity.

In 2006, Wiltshire was made a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) for services to art.&lt;ref name=MBE&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article336417.ece|title=Honour for autistic man who speaks through art|author=Kirby, Terry|date=4 January 2006|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=12 November 2007|location=London|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022104038/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article336417.ece|archivedate=22 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he opened a permanent gallery on the [[Royal Opera Arcade]] in London.&lt;ref name=WMSWiltshire/&gt;

==Early life==
Stephen Wiltshire was born in [[London]], England, in 1974 to [[Caribbean]] parents; his father, Colvin, was a native of [[Barbados]], and his mother, Geneva, is a native of [[St. Lucia]].&lt;ref name=MBE/&gt; He grew up in [[Little Venice, London|Little Venice]], [[Maida Vale]], London.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;Philby, Charlotte (23 January 2009). [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/my-secret-life-stephen-wiltshire-artist-34-1488487.html "My secret life: Stephen Wiltshire, artist, 34"]. ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Wiltshire was [[speech disorder|mute]] when young. At the age of three, he was diagnosed with [[autism]]. The same year, his father died in a motorbike accident.&lt;ref name=WiltshireBio/&gt;&lt;ref name=MBE/&gt;

At the age of five, Wiltshire was sent to [[Queensmill School]] in London where he expressed interest in drawing. His early illustrations depicted animals and cars; he is still extremely interested in American cars and is said to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of them. When he was about seven, Wiltshire became fascinated with sketching landmark London buildings. After being shown a book of photos depicting the devastation wrought by earthquakes, he began to create detailed architectural drawings of imaginary cityscapes. He began to communicate through his art. The instructors at Queensmill School would deal with his lack of verbal communication skills by temporarily taking away his art supplies so that he would be forced to learn to ask for them. Stephen responded by making sounds and eventually uttered his first word—"paper." His teachers encouraged his drawing, and with their aid Wiltshire learned to speak fully at the age of nine.&lt;ref name=WiltshireBio/&gt;

In June 2015, the BBC’s Lucy Ash reported: "Soon people outside the school started noticing Stephen's gift and aged eight he landed his first commission - a sketch of Salisbury Cathedral for the former Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]]".&lt;ref name="BBC News 12 June 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= Drawing what our mouths cannot say |url=  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-33092748| last= Ash| first= Lucy| date= 12 June 2015| website= [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate= 12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was ten, Wiltshire drew a sequence of drawings of London landmarks, one for each letter, that he called a "London Alphabet".&lt;ref name=WMSWiltshire/&gt;

In 1987, Wiltshire was part of the BBC programme ''The Foolish Wise Ones''.&lt;ref name=WMSWiltshire&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wisconsinmedicalsociety.org/savant_syndrome/savant_profiles/stephen_wiltshire| title=Stephen Wiltshire – Prodigious Drawing Ability and Visual Memory| publisher=Wisconsin Medical Society| last=Treffert| first=Darold| accessdate=7 November 2007| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018041538/http://www.wisconsinmedicalsociety.org/savant_syndrome/savant_profiles/stephen_wiltshire| archivedate=18 October 2007| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Drawings'', a collection of his works, was published that same year.&lt;ref name=WMSWiltshire/&gt;

Between 1995 and his graduation in 1998, Wiltshire attended the [[City and Guilds of London Art School]] in [[Kennington]], [[Lambeth]], South London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stephenwiltshire.co.uk/biography.aspx Education details at www.stephenwiltshire.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Wiltshire can look at a subject once and then draw an accurate and detailed picture of it. He frequently draws entire cities from memory, based on single, brief helicopter rides. For example, he produced a detailed drawing of four square miles of London after a single helicopter ride above that city. His nineteen-foot-long drawing of 305 square miles of New York City is based on a single twenty-minute helicopter ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1211299.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=10 March 2001|title=Unlocking the brain's potential|accessdate=8 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/28/nyregion/28about.html?_r=0|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=27 October 2009|title=Like a Skyline Is Etched in His Head|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also draws fictional scenes, for example, [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] surrounded by flames.

Wiltshire's early books include ''[[Drawings (book)|Drawings]]'' (1987), ''[[Cities (book)|Cities]]'' (1989), ''[[Floating Cities]]'' (1991), and ''[[Stephen Wiltshire's American Dream]]'' (1993). His third book, ''Floating Cities'' ([[Michael Joseph (publisher)|Michael Joseph]], 1991), was number one on the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' best-seller list.

It is a part of a global advertising campaign&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stephenwiltshire.co.uk/download_video.aspx?Id=3578 Television ad for UBS featuring Stephen Wiltshire]&lt;/ref&gt; for the Swiss bank [[UBS]] that carries the theme "We will not rest", ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/12/this-billboard-could-draw-attention/|title=This Billboard Could Draw Attention|work= The New York Times | first=Stuart|last=Elliott|date=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, Wiltshire drew an aerial panorama of the [[Singapore]] skyline from memory after a brief helicopter ride, taking five days to complete the 1 x 4m artwork. The artwork was presented to President [[Tony Tan]] as the Singapore Press Holding (SPH)'s gift to the nation in celebration of Singapore's 50th birthday in 2015, and will be displayed at [[Singapore City Gallery]], visitor centre of the country's urban planning authority, Urban Redevelopment Authority.

'''''The Duke of Burgundy''''' is a 2014 British [[drama film]] written and directed by [[Peter Strickland (director)|Peter Strickland]], and starring [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]] as Cynthia and [[Chiara D'Anna]] as Evelyn.

The film was screened at various film festivals, including the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], the [[London Film Festival]], and the [[International Film Festival Rotterdam]], to positive critical reviews.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/duke-burgundy-toronto-review-730976|title=‘The Duke of Burgundy’: Toronto Review |accessdate=8 November 2014 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/tiff-review-peter-stricklands-the-duke-of-burgundy-is-a-surreal-sublime-knock-out-20140910|title=TIFF Review: Peter Strickland’s ‘The Duke Of Burgundy’ Is A Surreal &amp; Sublime Knock-Out|accessdate=8 November 2014 |work=[[Indiewire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Evelyn is studying [[lepidopterology]] under the older Cynthia, who frequently lectures on her studies. Evelyn is romantically involved with Cynthia and works as a maid in her home, where she is subject to strict behavioural expectations and high standards for cleanliness. When Evelyn does not complete tasks to Cynthia's satisfaction, she is punished.

As Cynthia increasingly falters in her [[BDSM|dominance]], it becomes apparent that Evelyn is orchestrating Cynthia's role in the relationship by writing instructions and scripts for specific scenes, which the couple acts out in the same way each day. While Evelyn finds the scenes to be sexually exciting, Cynthia only acts them out to sate her lover. She attempts to please Evelyn by ordering a carpenter to construct a bed with a drawer underneath for Evelyn to sleep in as a punishment; however, Evelyn is unhappy with the length of time it will take to produce the bed, and ultimately refuses the gift.

Evelyn begins to demand that Cynthia lock her in a trunk in the evening as a new punishment. Cynthia agrees, but she is resentful about the new physical separation. Cynthia also becomes self-conscious about her aging, having injured her back moving the trunk to her bedside. She expresses her unhappiness on Evelyn's birthday, when she demands that Evelyn bake her own birthday cake, which Cynthia eats while reclining with her feet resting on Evelyn's face. Evelyn does not enjoy the scene and calls out her safeword, ''[[Sphinx pinastri|pinastri]]'', which Cynthia ignores.

The couple's relationship becomes more strained as Evelyn's expectations go unfulfilled. Finally, Cynthia accuses Evelyn of polishing another lecturer's boots, which she considers to be an act of betrayal. The two eventually seem to make up, and Evelyn agrees to put less emphasis on her sexual needs. The film ends with the couple going through the same play routine seen at the film's start.

==Title==
As [[lepidopterology]] (the study of moths and butterflies) is a theme throughout the film, the title refers to the Duke of Burgundy (''[[Hamearis lucina]]'') butterfly, although it is no longer known "how [it] received that name in the first place, any reasoning being lost in the mists of entomological antiquity."&lt;ref&gt;
Matthew Oates, ''In Pursuit of Butterflies: A Fifty-year Affair'' (New York: Bloomsbury, 2015), https://books.google.com/books?id=X8QJCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT41&amp;dq=%22any+reasoning+being+lost+in+the+mists%22+duke+burgundy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-lND525PMAhUEOT4KHVUgA5sQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22any%20reasoning%20being%20lost%20in%20the%20mists%22%20duke%20burgundy&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film received positive reviews from critics. [[Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports an approval rating of 93%, based on 92 reviews, with an average rating of 8 out of 10. The critical consensus reads "Stylish, sensual, and smart, ''The Duke of Burgundy'' proves that erotic cinema can have genuine substance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_duke_of_burgundy/ |title=The Duke Of Burgundy (2015) |accessdate=15 February 2018 |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[weighted average]] score, the film has a score of 87 out of 100, based on 24 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-duke-of-burgundy |title=The Duke of Burgundy |accessdate=29 November 2017 |publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The image is an oil painting on a lime wood board, executed in landscape format with the dimensions 186.1 x 120.6 centimeters. It shows on the bottom center, a winged serpent in flight from Cranach's workshop and the year 1546.&lt;ref&gt;''Katalog der Gemäldegalerie Berlin''. Berlin-Dahlem 1975, S. 118 f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://lucascranach.org/DE_smbGG_593&lt;/ref&gt;
It shows a fountain where older women but not men bathe, are rejuvenated and finally indulge in music, dance and good food. Cranach presents in this fairy tale image, in many details the real bathing culture of the Middle Ages, that based on the belief that certain baths might heal and rejuvenate. Sensual pleasures belonged to the bathroom now. The picture belonged to the inventory of the former Prussian royal palaces, and now hangs in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]] museum in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Henning Bock, Irene Geismeier, Rainald Grosshans, Jan Kelch, Wilhelm H.

==Analysis==
The background depicts a fantastic rocky landscape with unreal perspectives and proportions. A miniature castle on a rock can be seen on the far left, leaning over a cliff. In the center background a medieval city view is painted with a stone arch bridge over a river, which leads to the town. On the right a mighty mountain range is surrounded with lush fields and fruit trees. The barren rock on the left half symbolizes the arduous age of women, whilst the dense green forest on the right acts as a metaphor for youth. The basin, which covers the center foreground, is shown from a high point of view and is depicted as a square, surrounded by steps leading into the basin. The column-shaped fountain in the middle of the pool is crowned with the figures of Venus and Cupid, suggesting that the bath serves the force of love.

The foreground shows us the effect of the fountain, with elderly women, frail and worn, some even unable to walk, being led to the pool. They undress, get into the healing water, and appear rejuvenated on the right side of the pool, where a gallant young man shows them into a tent. Here the women get dressed before they can move on to indulge in sensual pleasures, as suggested in the right background, where young couples are dancing and dining to music.&lt;ref&gt;Dierk Spreen: "Die kurze Geschichte der Zeitmaschine". in: ''Quarre Merkur 89/90''. 1999, Nr. 36. S. 111–113.)&lt;/ref&gt; On the left edge of the pool we can see a man in a red jacket holding a book. He gazes at one of the elderly nude women, which suggests that he is a scholar or doctor, examining the effect of the fountain. On the edge of the basin, two women wrapped in towels are shown. These women, of which one sits at the front left corner and the other at the center bottom of the basin, seem to be reluctant to get into the water, doubting whether a rejuvenated life is even desirable. The fact that only women attend this bath, is due to the belief that older men would automatically rejuvenate in dealing with young women. In reality such alleged healing springs were also visited by men. In Cranach's picture all men are young, represented gallant and advantageous towards the elder women, however ugly and unattractive. Spread over the entire image, Cranach's figures refer to the individual stages of supernatural transformation: it is the search for paradise. The picture shows a man's dream. Bathing was associated with health, which easily led to the belief in broader effects of water, as shown by baptismal rites of religions. The fountain was a popular motif in medieval narratives, especially in [[medieval French literature]], and offered versatile opportunities for depictions of nudes and genre scenes.

The presentation of old naked women is very uncommon for the art of this period: idealized nudes of young men and women were a more widespread genre. The beauty ideal for women in Cranach's age consisted of a bulging belly, round shapes without pubic hair, high-set breasts with small nipples and fair hair. Most of the figures in Cranach's work follow the ideals of beauty of the time and leads experts to believe that this painting is by his hand. However, the attribution of the picture is not certain. Research calls both Lucas Cranach the Elder and his son as the author. Lately it is associated with the late work of the father, but other employees of the Cranach workshop were probably involved in the execution. It is believed that the painting was commissioned, by an unknown client.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.1000-jahre-kronach-ev.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=543&amp;Itemid=29|title=Verein 1000 Jahre Kronach e.V. -  Der Geschichts- und Kulturverein in der Lucas-Cranach-Stadt Kronach - 500 Jahre - Lucas Cranach d.

==Provenance==
By 1830, the fountain was part of the management of the royal palaces. Then it came to the Royal Museum and now hangs in the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin.

The '''Royal Albert Dock'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Liverpool's Albert Dock gets royal title |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-44368901 |date=6 June 2018|access-date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a complex of dock buildings and warehouses in [[Liverpool]], [[England]]. Designed by [[Jesse Hartley]] and [[Philip Hardwick]], it was opened in 1846, and was the first structure in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to be built from cast iron, brick and stone, with no structural wood. As a result, it was the first non-combustible warehouse system in the world.&lt;ref name=p83&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of its construction the Albert Dock (as it was formerly known before receiving its Royal status in 2018) was considered a revolutionary docking system because ships were loaded and unloaded directly from/to the warehouses. Two years after it opened it was modified to feature the world's first [[hydraulic]] [[Crane (machine)|cranes]].&lt;ref name=p46&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its open yet secure design, the Albert Dock became a popular store for valuable cargoes such as [[brandy]], [[cotton]], [[tea]], [[silk]], [[tobacco]], [[ivory]] and [[sugar]]. However, despite the Albert Dock's advanced design, the rapid development of shipping technology meant that within 50 years, larger, more open docks were required, although it remained a valuable store for cargo.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Albert Dock was requisitioned by the [[Admiralty]] serving as a base for boats of the [[Home Fleet|British Atlantic Fleet]]. The complex was damaged during [[Strategic bombing|air raids]] on Liverpool, notably during the [[Liverpool Blitz|May Blitz]] of 1941. In the aftermath of the war, the financial problems of the owners and the general decline of docking in the city meant that the future of the Albert Dock was uncertain. Numerous plans were developed for the re-use of the buildings but none came to fruition and in 1972 the dock was finally closed. Having lain derelict for nearly ten years, the redevelopment of the dock began in 1981, when the [[Merseyside Development Corporation]] was set up, with the Albert Dock being officially re-opened in 1984.

Today the Royal Albert Dock is a major tourist attraction in the city and the most visited multi-use attraction in the [[United Kingdom]], outside [[London]].&lt;ref name="Albert Dock: The Present Day"&gt;{{cite web |title=Albert Dock: The Present Day |publisher=Albert Dock Company Ltd |url=http://www.albertdock.com/pages/index.php?page_id=1257 |access-date=24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a vital component of Liverpool's [[UNESCO]] designated [[World Heritage]] [[Maritime Mercantile City]] and the docking complex and warehouses also comprise the largest single collection of [[Grade I]] [[listed buildings]] anywhere in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/cityofculture2008/story/0,,950372,00.html |title=Glory of Greece, grandeur of Rome ... and docks of Liverpool |publisher=Guardian Unlimited |date=7 March 2003 |author=Helen Carter |access-date=27 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Grand beginnings and early history===

[[Image:Albert Docks Liverpool.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Albert Dock's design allowed ships to lay up and be loaded and unloaded directly from the large warehouses]]
The history of the Albert Dock dates back to 1837, when Jesse Hartley first began the development of plans for a combined [[Dock (maritime)|dock]] and [[warehouse]] system.&lt;ref name="p83" /&gt; The plans drawn up by Hartley and fellow [[civil engineer]] Philip Hardwick for the Albert Dock were at the time considered quite 'radical', as they envisioned the loading and unloading of ships directly from the warehouses.&lt;ref name=heyday&gt;{{cite web |title=Construction, heyday and decline of the Albert Dock |publisher=[[National Museums Liverpool]] |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/albertdock/historyofthealbertdock.asp |access-date=26 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906100035/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/albertdock/historyofthealbertdock.asp |archivedate=6 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this idea was not new, and as far back as the 1803 Warehousing Act, legislation had been passed to allow this form of development to occur, whilst the concept was first actually used in the construction of [[St Katharine Docks|St Katharine's Dock]] in [[London]], which was opened in 1828.&lt;ref name=p18&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the development process, Hartley was eager to test the fire resistance of any particular design by constructing an {{convert|18|ft|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} dummy structure, filling it with timber and tar, and setting it alight. After testing several structural designs he settled on the combination of [[cast iron]], [[brick]], [[sandstone]] and [[granite]].&lt;ref name="p20"/&gt; The design was submitted for [[planning permission]] in 1839 although it wasn't until 1841, when the [[Act of Parliament|bill]] authorising the design of the dock was eventually passed by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], that construction was allowed to begin.&lt;ref name=p19&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hist&gt;{{cite web |title=Albert Dock History |publisher=Albert Dock Company Ltd |url=http://www.albertdock.com/pages/index.php?page_id=2 |access-date=24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jesse Hartley.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Jesse Hartley]]
The site chosen for the dock to be built on was an area of land bordered by [[Salthouse Dock]] to the east, the entrance channel to [[Canning Dock]] to the north and by [[Duke's Dock]] to the south. The land earmarked for the site had to be cleared, with 59 tenants being evicted and numerous premises demolished including a [[pub]], several houses and the Dock Trustee's Dockyard.&lt;ref name=p20&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the clearance of this land both the Salthouse and Canning dock's were drained to allow entrance passages into the Albert Dock to be constructed, whilst hundreds of '[[Navvies]]' were employed to dig out the dock basin and construct the new river wall. The dock basin was completed by February 1845, allowing the first ships to enter the Albert Dock, although with the warehouses still under construction this was merely to allow these boats to 'lay-up'.&lt;ref name=p23&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dock complex was officially opened in 1846 by [[Albert, Prince Consort]], husband of [[Queen Victoria]] and the man in honour of whom it was named. This event marked the first occasion in [[Liverpool]]'s history in which a member of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] had made a state visit to the city and as a result the occasion was marked with a major celebrations.&lt;ref name=p12&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many thousands of people turned out for the Royal visit with the newspaper ''The Pictorial Times'' noting the reception Prince Albert received:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"His reception was most enthusiastic; balconies were erected along the line of procession, and these and the windows of houses were filled with gay and animated parties. There was a most brilliant display of flags, banners &amp; c. [sic]. All business is suspended. There are 200,000 strangers in town, and all the inhabitants are in the streets. All is gaiety and splendour." (''The Pictorial Times'', 1846).&lt;ref name=p13&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Prince was taken on a processional tour through the city, including a visit to the [[Liverpool Town Hall|town hall]] where the royal address was made, before departing aboard the ferry across to the [[Cheshire]] side of the [[Mersey]] and then northwards towards the Albert Dock.&lt;ref name=p13/&gt;&lt;ref name=p14&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again this stage of the procession route was laden with onlookers with ''The Pictorial Times'' describing the Prince's entrance into the Albert Dock:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"From the Cheshire side of the river the Fairy crossed to the Liverpool side, and returned along the line of docks amidst the cheers of assembled thousands and the roar of artillery. The sight was really magnificent, all the ships in the docks were decked out in gayest colours and the river was crowded with boats filled with people. At half-past two the fairy entered the dock, where were assembled two thousand ladies and gentlemen, the elite of the town; they cheered enthusiastically, which his Royal Highness returned, and in order to gratify the crowd sailed round the dock." (''The Pictorial Times'', 1846).&lt;ref name=p14/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the official opening occurring in 1846, the construction of the Albert Dock was not fully completed until 1847. In 1848, a new dock office was built and the dock itself was upgraded to feature a [[hydraulic]] cargo handling [[Hoist (device)|hoist]] system, the first of its kind in the world.&lt;ref name=p46/&gt; Over the next decade several more buildings where added including houses for the [[Harbourmaster|piermaster]], his assistant &amp; the warehouse superintendent; and a [[cooper (profession)|cooper]]age. Warehousing in the dock was also expanded to meet the increasing demand by joining together the eastern and western ends of the Southern Stack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Historic Facts 1824 - 1854 |publisher=Albert Dock Company Ltd |url=http://www.albertdock.com/pages/index.php?page_id=1213 |access-date=2 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing fortunes and role in the Second World War===

[[Image:Dkbkpl28.jpg|right|thumb|British Empire Dockyards and Ports, 1909]]
The enclosed design of the Albert Dock and the direct loading and unloading of goods from warehouses meant that the complex was more secure than other docks within [[Liverpool]]. As a result it became a popular store for valuable cargoes including [[brandy]], [[cotton]], [[tea]], [[silk]], [[tobacco]], [[ivory]] and [[sugar]]. At the same time their openness to natural light and well ventilated stores meant natural goods such as [[hemp]] or sugar could be kept fresher, for longer.&lt;ref name=heyday/&gt; The dock came to dominate Liverpool's far eastern trade, with over 90% of the city's silk imports from [[China]] coming through it and more generally half of all the far eastern trade income.&lt;ref name=p24&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the great prosperity the dock afforded the city, within 20 years of its construction the Albert Dock was beginning to struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chrimes|1991|p=76}}: "arguably out-of-date before they were built"&lt;/ref&gt; Designed and constructed to handle sailing ships of up to 1,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes, by the start of the 20th century only 7% of ships into the [[Port of Liverpool]] were sailing vessels.&lt;ref name=Hist/&gt; The development of steam ships in the later 19th century meant that soon the dock simply wasn't large enough, as its narrow entrances prevented larger vessels from entering it.&lt;ref name="p24"/&gt; Its lack of quayside was also becoming an issue. Generally [[steamship]]s could be loaded and unloaded far quicker than [[sailing ship]]s, and in a cruel twist of irony, the dockside warehouses that had once made the Albert Dock so attractive, were now hindering its future development.&lt;ref name=heyday/&gt; Nonetheless the Albert Dock remained an integral part of the dock system in Liverpool and in 1878 the [[pump house]] was built as part of redevelopment that saw the majority of the cranes converted to hydraulic use, whilst in 1899, part of the north stack was converted to allow for ice production and cold storage.&lt;ref name=hf1860&gt;{{cite web |title=Historic Facts 1860 - 1970 |publisher=Albert Dock Company Ltd|url=http://www.albertdock.com/pages/index.php?page_id=1213 |access-date=2 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1920s virtually all commercial shipping activity had ceased at the dock, although its warehouses did remain in use for the storage of goods transported by barge, road or rail.&lt;ref name=hf1860/&gt;&lt;ref name=p47&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The onset of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1939 saw the Albert Dock being 'requisitioned' by the [[Admiralty]] and used as base for the [[Home Fleet|British Atlantic fleet]] including submarines, small warships and landing craft. During the war the dock was struck on several occasions including a bombing raid in 1940 that damaged ships within it, and more destructively during the [[Liverpool Blitz#The May Blitz|May Blitz]] of 1941 when German bombing caused extensive damage to the south west stack.&lt;ref name=p47/&gt; By the end of the war almost 15% of the Albert Dock's floor space was out of use because of bomb damage.&lt;ref name=p28&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post War history and decline===

By the time the Second World War had finished the Albert Dock's future looked bleak. The owners of the dock, the [[Mersey Docks and Harbour Board]] (MDHB) were in financial crisis and chose not to repair any of the wartime bomb damage, adopting an attitude of 'if it's not broke don't fix it, and if it is broke we still won't fix it'.&lt;ref name=p29&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time a change in geo-political orientation towards [[Europe]], coupled with the advent of [[containerisation]] meant the whole docking system in the city of Liverpool suffered as newer, stronger ports emerged elsewhere in the [[UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belchem|2006|loc=Chpt. Milne, G.J. "Maritime Liverpool"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless the architectural and technological value of the docks was recognised in 1952 when the Albert Dock was granted Grade I [[listed building]] status.&lt;ref name=hf1860/&gt;

Despite this recognition, the increasing debts of the MDHB meant that by the 1960s the company was eager to get rid of the Albert Dock. Having considered demolishing the buildings and redeveloping the land,&lt;ref name=p47/&gt; the MDHB soon entered negotiations to sell the land to Oldham Estates, a property developer owned by [[Harry Hyams]].&lt;ref name=p29/&gt; Many plans for the site were developed including one that envisioned the development of a mini city that would provide 10m sq feet of letting space, hotels, restaurants, bars and underground parking in the drained dock basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=City's Reputation Will Depend Upon Waterfront Plan |newspaper=[[Liverpool Echo]] |date=30 May 1966 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the council reluctant to allow such a ''grandiose'' development to occur and with the huge public opposition to it (inspired at least in part by the work of [[Quentin Hughes (architect)|Quentin Hughes]]), Oldham Estates were forced into scaling-down the plan and so in 1970 returned with a new vision known as 'Aquarius City', which had as its centrepiece a 44-storey skyscraper. Once again the plan failed to develop and no sooner had it been announced, than the MDHB's financial problems reached crisis point, Oldham Estates withdrew their deposit and the whole scheme fell through.&lt;ref name=p29/&gt;

[[Image:The Albert Dock from the River Mersey, 1979.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Albert Dock viewed from the [[River Mersey]] in 1979]]
With the MDHB on the verge of bankruptcy a decision was taken to shut down and sell off the whole of the south docks system. The warehouses were emptied and in 1972 the Albert Dock finally closed down. The [[Brunswick Dock]] gates, which separated the South Docks system from the [[River Mersey]], were opened allowing tidal movements in and the process of the clogging up the docks with sewage polluted silt began.&lt;ref name=p48&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=p30&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many senses just as the Albert Dock's development had symbolised the prosperity in the Liverpool at the time of its construction, its subsequent decline after the Second World War symbolised the collapse of the local economy as a whole.&lt;ref name=belchem&gt;{{harvnb|Belchem|2006|loc=Chpt. Murden, John "City of Change and Challenge: Liverpool Since 1945"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the early 1970s plans continued to emerge for the redevelopment of the Albert Dock site and the whole of the south docks system in general. Many of these plans were quite extreme including [[Liverpool City Council]]'s suggestion to use the dock basin as a [[landfill]] site. The [[Mersey Docks and Harbour Company]] (MDHC), the reincarnation of the now defunct Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, however felt it could get more money by filling in the dock basin with sand and selling it as developable land and not derelict land. One plan for the Albert Dock that was taken more seriously was the idea that it become the new home of [[Liverpool Polytechnic]] (now John Moores University). The government was even willing to provide £3m in funding but like so many other plans this too fell by the wayside.&lt;ref name=p31&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of [[Merseyside County Council]] (MCC) in 1974 brought new hope that the Albert Dock could be redeveloped, with the MCC placing a high priority on its development. They soon entered negotiations with the MDHC and in 1979 eventually negotiated a deal to take over the running of the south docks.&lt;ref name=hf1972&gt;{{cite web |title=Historic Facts Historic Facts 1972 - 2002 |publisher=Albert Dock Company Ltd |url=http://www.albertdock.com/pages/index.php?page_id=1313 |access-date=2 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this seeming step forward political wrangling between the MDHC (the dock owners), [[Liverpool City Council]] (the local planning authority) and [[Merseyside County Council]] (the group now responsible for redeveloping the docks) continued to hinder any development plans.&lt;ref name="p31" /&gt; Fed up with the in fighting the newly elected Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] decided that the city was incapable of handling regeneration initiatives itself and under the guidance of the 'Minister for Merseyside' [[Michael Heseltine]], set up the Merseyside Development Corporation in 1981 to take over the responsibility of regenerating and redeveloping Liverpool's south docks.&lt;ref name=belchem/&gt;&lt;ref name=p32&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The MDC and regeneration of the Albert Dock===

The creation of the [[Merseyside Development Corporation]] (MDC) in 1981 was part of a [[Development Corporation|new initiative]] launched by the then [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government that earmarked the regeneration of some {{convert|800|acre|km2}} of Liverpool's south docks, by using public sector investment to create infrastructure within an area that could then in turn be used to attract private sector investment. Thus the MDC was not directly responsible for [[urban renewal|regeneration]] programmes but rather acted as a spearhead, guiding the development process. Upon its formation it immediately created an initial strategy for the area placing a high priority on restoring those buildings that could be restored &amp; demolishing the rest, restoring a water regime within the dock system (including the removal of up to {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} of silt) and general environmental landscaping. As part of the strategy two flagship schemes were set up: the redevelopment of a site in [[Otterspool Promenade|Otterspool]] for the [[International Garden Festival]] and the regeneration of the Albert Dock.&lt;ref name="p32" /&gt;

In 1982 the MDC entered into negotiations with [[London]]-based developers Arrowcroft in order to secure much needed private sector investment. On a visit to the site, Arrowcroft's chairman Leonard Eppel spoke of how the buildings "talked to him" and upon his return to London set about persuading the company's board to take on the project.&lt;ref name=p33&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1983 a deal was signed between Arrowcroft plc and the MDC leading to the creation of the Albert Dock Company, which could now start the process of regenerating the Albert Dock.&lt;ref name=creating&gt;{{cite web|title=Creating a museum |publisher=[[National Museums Liverpool]] |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/albertdock/creatingamuseum.asp |access-date=6 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720073139/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/albertdock/creatingamuseum.asp |archivedate=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Albert Dock2.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The former Dock Office was for many years the home of [[Granada Television]] in Liverpool.]]
One of the first priorities of the regeneration was the restoration of the dock system, which had deteriorated rapidly since the [[Brunswick Dock]] gates had been left open. Contaminated silt was removed from the dock basin, dock gates were replaced &amp; bridges restored, whilst the dock walls were repaired.&lt;ref name=p34&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Albert Dock company appointed [[Tarmac Group|Tarmac Construction]] to renovate the dock's vast warehouses and repair war time bomb damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ritchie|1999|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural surveys carried out by the MDC found the brickwork and foundations to be in very good condition and it was considered a testament to the strict build quality of [[Jesse Hartley|Hartley]]'s design that a building almost 150 years old was still in such good condition.&lt;ref name=p34/&gt;

Development within the Albert Dock was rapid and the newly renovated Edward Pavilion (formerly north east stack) was ready in time for the 1984 [[Tall Ships' Races|Cutty Sark Tall Ship Race]]. The race was a big success for the city with over one million visitors into Liverpool over a period of four days, of which 160,000 visited the Albert Dock. In total it is estimated that the two flagship regeneration schemes of the MDC, the tall ships race and International Garden Festival, attracted over 3.5 million visitors to Liverpool in 1984. Also completed in 1984 was the renovation of the dock traffic office, which was fitted out and leased to [[Granada Television]].&lt;ref name=p35&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Weather docks.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The floating weather map of the British Isles, from [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'']]

Spurred by the success of the tall ships race and the International Garden Festival, Arrowcroft pushed on with the Albert Dock's renovation. With the Edward Pavilion refurbishment a success soon the company started on the Britannia and Atlantic pavilions (formerly the south and south east stacks), the latter of which required major structural repairs because of bomb damage it received during World War II. In 1986 the [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]] completed its move into the Albert Dock, having moved some exhibitions into the building in 1984. The museum, developed by [[Merseyside County Council]] had previously been located in the [[pilotage]] building and a salvage shed nearby.&lt;ref name=creating/&gt; Also in 1986 work began on the largest of the dock warehouses, the Colonnades (formerly west stack). Ground floor shops were created with office space on the [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] level and apartments on the remaining floors. The first 37 of these apartments were completed by 1988 and the speed with which they sold was likened to 'sales day at [[Harrods]]'.&lt;ref name=p36&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Albert Dock was officially re-opened in 1988 by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]],&lt;ref name=p37&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; the great-great-great-grandson of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], the man who had originally opened the docks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Royal Family Tree |publisher=Britroyals.com |url=http://www.britroyals.com/royaltree.htm |access-date=25 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080913184759/http://www.britroyals.com/royaltree.htm| archivedate= 13 September 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was timed to coincide with the opening of the newly finished [[Tate Liverpool]], which was dubbed the 'Tate of the north' and at the time the only one outside London.&lt;ref name=p49&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to locate a [[Tate]] gallery in Liverpool was seen as a major success for the city, as it made Liverpool home to the National Collection of [[modern art]] in the North of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Tate Liverpool |publisher=Tate |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/who-we-are/history-of-tate#liverpool |access-date=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s new morning television show ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'', hosted by [[Richard and Judy]], began broadcasting from a studio inside the Albert Dock. As part of the show weather presenter [[Fred Talbot]] used a floating map of the British Isles to report the forecast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Warwick |first=Dave |title=Fred Talbot |url=http://www.davewarwick.co.uk/dave_warwick_fred_talbot.htm |access-date=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later in 1990 [[The Beatles Story]] museum opened, the only [[Beatles]] themed visitor attraction in Britain, providing yet another draw to the Albert Dock.&lt;ref name=p37/&gt;

Throughout the 1990s development continued including a new hotel and the conversion of vacant space for use by larger companies such as [[Telewest]] (Now Virgin Media).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hodgson |first=Neil |title=Telewest jobs announcement |publisher=icLiverpool |date=14 June 2002 |url=http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100regionalnews/page.cfm?objectid=11951315&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50061 |access-date=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally in 2003, some 22 years after the renovation of the Albert Dock started, the last remaining undeveloped space was brought into use with the opening of a new [[Premier Lodge]] hotel in the Britannia Pavilion.&lt;ref name=p37/&gt;

In lieu of the dock's 175 anniversary in 2021, the owners of the dock applied for a royal charter. At a event at Tate Liverpool on 6th June 2018 the royal charter was handed over. The dock will be formally known as Royal Albert Dock Liverpool to avoid confusion with the Royal Albert Dock in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Royal title for Liverpool's Albert Dock |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-44368901 |website=BBC News |accessdate=6 June 2018 |date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Houghton |first1=Alistair |title=New Royal name for the Albert Dock |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/business/albert-dock-renamed-royal-albert-14748439 |website=liverpoolecho |accessdate=6 June 2018 |date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural design and construction==

When it was constructed the Albert Dock was considered a [[state of the art]] docking system.&lt;ref name="p24" /&gt; Built almost entirely from [[cast iron]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]] and [[brick]], the Albert Dock was designed to be fireproof, and on completion was the world's first non-combustible warehouse system. It provided {{convert|1290000|sqft|m2}} of warehouse space and its dock basin had a water area of {{convert|7.75|acre|ha}}. In its construction over 23 million bricks were used and 47,000 tonnes of mortar.&lt;ref name="p83"/&gt; In total it cost £782,265 (approximately £41m today),&lt;ref name=heyday/&gt; whilst today its estimated to be worth £230 million.&lt;ref name=p38&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building's design complements many existing construction techniques with, what were considered at the time, radical solutions. The warehouses are supported by large [[load-bearing wall]]s that range from being {{convert|3|ft|m}} thick at the base to {{convert|19|in}} on the fourth level. One of the most advanced architectural features is the use of [[stressed skin]] roofing, which at the time of construction was virtually unheard of. Huge iron [[trusses]] are crossed with [[rivet]]ted and [[galvanised]] [[wrought iron]] plates, creating a shape similar to an upturned boat hull that acts to support the roof above.&lt;ref name=p22&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The floors in the warehouses are supported by large iron columns and the spaces between were considered 'highly flexible', as new windows, stairwells and lift shafts could be added without risk to the building's structural integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Albert Dock Warehouses |publisher=Liverpool World Heritage |url=http://www.liverpoolworldheritage.com/visitingthewhs/areas/albertdock/Albert_Dock_warehouses.asp |access-date=5 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629045643/http://www.liverpoolworldheritage.com/visitingthewhs/areas/albertdock/Albert_Dock_warehouses.asp|archivedate=29 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Albert Dock Liverpool 4.jpg|thumb|left|Huge cast iron columns line the Albert Dock's quayside helping to support the building above]]
The advanced design stretches far beyond what can be seen from the ground. The structures are free from wood, but their foundations contain 13,729 [[Deep foundation|piles]] of timber, which would stretch for {{Convert|48|mi|km}} in length if laid end to end. Such heavily supportive foundations were needed because the construction land was reclaimed from the [[River Mersey]] to build on. Given the '[[quicksand]]' nature of the Mersey's tidal silt the piles were needed to provide maximum stability. The resultant effect of the dock being constructed where it was is that the north and west stacks (now Merseyside Maritime Museum and Colonnades) rise and fall with every tide.&lt;ref name="p20" /&gt;

One of the most notable features of the Albert Dock are the huge cast iron columns that line the quayside.&lt;ref name=p21&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; At {{convert|15|ft|m}} high and almost {{convert|13|ft|m}} in circumference, the columns are based upon the Greek [[Doric style]] of architecture.&lt;ref name=hughes&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|1999|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jesse Hartley|Hartley]]'s decision to use cast iron was an economic one as at the time it was cheaper than [[granite]]. Nonetheless, because of the huge dock walls that were built, the Albert Dock's construction required so much granite that the dock trustee's had to open their own mine in [[Kirkcudbrightshire]] in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name=heyday/&gt;&lt;ref name=p21/&gt; The quality of the build materials used as well as the docks sheer size are considered a strong illustration of the great prosperity that the [[Port of Liverpool]] afforded the city at the time and the building's style is described as [[cyclopean]] [[classicism]].&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt;

==Albert Dock today==
Today the Albert Dock is one of Liverpool's most important tourist attractions and a vital component of the city's [[UNESCO world heritage]] [[Maritime Mercantile City]]. As well as being the number one tourist attraction in Liverpool,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Albert Dock |publisher=VisitLiverpool.com|url=http://www.visitliverpool.com/site/albert-dock-p16143 |access-date=24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Albert Dock is also the most visited multi-use attraction in the [[United Kingdom]] outside [[London]], with in excess of four million visitors per year.&lt;ref name="Albert Dock: The Present Day" /&gt; Amongst the many attractions at the Albert Dock are the [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]], [[the Beatles Story]]  and the [[Tate Liverpool]]. There are also two hotels within the Albert Dock: a [[Holiday Inn]] and [[Premier Inn]] both located in the Britannia Pavilion.&lt;ref name="p82"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the five warehouses around the dock, referred to as A, B, C, D and E, are Grade&amp;nbsp;I listed buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1205175|desc= Warehouse A, Albert Dock|access-date= 21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1068409|desc= Warehouses B and C, Albert Dock|access-date= 21 March 2015|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1280847|desc= Warehouse D, Albert Dock|access-date= 21 March 2015|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1068410|desc= Warehouse E, Albert Dock|access-date= 21 March 2015|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also listed Grade&amp;nbsp;I is the former dock traffic office.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1356264|desc= Dock Traffic Office, Albert Dock|access-date= 21 March 2015|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other buildings around the dock are listed Grade&amp;nbsp;II; they are the former hydraulic pumping station,&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1280849|desc= Hydraulic Pumping Station to East of Canning Half-Tide Dock |access-date= 21 March 2015|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[swing bridge]] leading from the dock towards the Pierhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1356265|desc= Swingbridge, Albert Dock |access-date= 21 March 2015|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the dock's regeneration in the 1980s a policy had been adopted to try to attract retailers into the newly created premises within. However, after many years of struggling to compete with other major shopping areas in the city, the Albert Dock Company Ltd announced in 2007 a shift into attracting more bars and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gleeson |first=Bill |title= Albert Dock primed for ‘colossal tourism’|publisher=[[Liverpool Daily Post]] |date=6 August 2007 |url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/business/business-local/2007/08/06/albert-dock-primed-for-colossal-tourism-64375-19575999/ |accessdate=24 September 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107095559/http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/business/business-local/2007/08/06/albert-dock-primed-for-colossal-tourism-64375-19575999/|archivedate=7 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, bars and restaurants resident in the Albert Dock include Panam Bar &amp; Restaurant, Revolution Bar, Spice Lounge, and Whats Cooking?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Albert Dock: Food and Drink |publisher=Albert Dock Company Ltd |url=http://www.albertdock.com/pages/index.php?page_id=51 |access-date=24 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081014173819/http://www.albertdock.com/pages/index.php?page_id=51| archivedate= 14 October 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Wien NHM Venus von Willendorf.jpg|thumb|[[Venus of Willendorf]]]]
A '''Venus figurine''' is any [[Upper Paleolithic]] [[Figurine|statuette]] portraying a woman,&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740"&gt;Fagan, 740&lt;/ref&gt; with fewer images depicting men or figures of uncertain sex,&lt;ref&gt;Beck, 203&lt;/ref&gt; and those in [[relief]] or engraved on rock or stones are often discussed together.&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740-741"&gt;Fagan, 740-741&lt;/ref&gt; Most have been unearthed in [[Europe]], but others have been found as far away as [[Siberia]], extending their distribution across much of [[Eurasia]], although with many gaps, such as the [[Mediterranean]] outside Italy.&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740-741; Beck, 203"&gt;Fagan, 740-741; Beck, 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of them date from the [[Gravettian]] period (26,000–21,000 years ago),&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740-741"/&gt; but examples exist as early as the [[Venus of Hohle Fels]], which dates back at least 35,000 years to the [[Aurignacian]], and as late as the [[Venus of Monruz]], from about 11,000 years ago in the [[Magdalenian]].  These [[figurine]]s were carved from soft stone (such as [[steatite]], [[calcite]] or [[limestone]]), bone or ivory, or formed of [[clay]] and fired. The latter are among the oldest [[ceramic]]s known. In total, some 144 such figurines are known;&lt;ref&gt;Cook&lt;/ref&gt; virtually all of modest size, between 3&amp;nbsp;cm and 40&amp;nbsp;cm or more in height.&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740"/&gt;  They are some of the earliest works of [[prehistoric art]].

Most of them have small heads, wide hips, and legs that taper to a point. Various figurines exaggerate the abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, or vulva, although many do not, and the concentration in popular accounts on those that do reflects modern preoccupations rather than the range of actual artefacts. In contrast, arms and feet are often absent, and the head is usually small and faceless.  Depictions of hairstyles can be detailed, and especially in Siberian examples, clothing or tattoos may be indicated.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, 740-741; Isabella, Jude, interview with April Nowell. ''"Palaeo-porn": we’ve got it all wrong'', 2012. ''New Scientist'', 216, Issue 2890, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21628900-300-palaeo-porn-weve-got-it-all-wrong/ online]; Cook; Beck, 205-214&lt;/ref&gt;

The original cultural meaning and purpose of these artifacts is not known. It has frequently been suggested that they may have served a ritual or symbolic function.  There are widely varying and speculative interpretations of their use or meaning: they have been seen as religious figures,&lt;ref&gt;Beck, 207-208&lt;/ref&gt; as [[erotic art]] or sex aids,&lt;ref&gt;Rudgley, Richard, ''The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age'', 2000, Simon and Schuster, {{ISBN|0684862700}}, 9780684862705194-198, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vhSHn-B89A0C&amp;pg=PA194 google books]; Fagan, 740-741&lt;/ref&gt; grandmother goddesses or as self-depictions by female artists.&lt;ref&gt;William Haviland, Harald Prins, Dana Walrath, Bunny McBride, ''Anthropology: The Human Challenge'', 13th edition, 2010, Cengage Learning, {{ISBN|0495810843}}, 9780495810841,[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Fm2RY5ZKmDIC&amp;pg=PA220 google books]; Cook; Beck, 205-208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lawson |first1=Alex |url=https://www.metafilter.com/177818/The-Talk-for-45-year-old-women#7569728 |website=MetaFilter |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
[[File:Venus impudique (1907 drawing).jpg|thumb|right|upright|''[[Vénus impudique]]'', 1907 drawing]]
The expression 'Venus' was first used in the mid-nineteenth century by the [[Paul Hurault, 8th Marquis de Vibraye|Marquis de Vibraye]], who discovered an important ivory figurine and named it ''[[Vénus impudique|La Vénus impudique]]'' or ''Venus Impudica'' ("immodest Venus"), contrasting it to the ''[[Venus Pudica]]'', [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]] sculpture by [[Praxiteles]] showing [[Aphrodite]] covering her naked pubis with her right hand.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, 202-203&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the name is metaphorical as there is no link between the figurines and the [[Venus (mythology)|Roman goddess Venus]], although they have been interpreted as representations of a primordial female goddess. The term has been criticised for being more a reflection of modern western ideas than reflecting the beliefs of the sculptures' original owners, but the name has persisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Dr. Beth Harris &amp; Dr. Steven Zucker|date=27 May 2012|title= Nude Woman (Venus of Willendorf), c. 28,000-25,000 B.C.E.|trans-title= |medium= youtube video|language= English|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENAZqOoOVaI&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player|access-date= 1 June 2015|archive-url= |archive-date= |format= |time= 0:21|location= |publisher= Smarthistory, Art History at Khan Academy|id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of discovery ==
''[[Vénus impudique]]'', the figurine that gave the whole class its name, was the very first Paleolithic sculptural representation of a woman discovered in modern times. It was found in about 1864 by [[Paul Hurault, 8th Marquis de Vibraye]] at the famous archaeological site of [[Laugerie-Basse]] in the [[Vézère]] valley (one of the many important Stone Age sites in and around the commune of [[Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil]] in [[Dordogne]], southwestern [[France]]). The [[Magdalenian]] "Venus" from Laugerie-Basse is headless, footless, armless but with a strongly incised vaginal opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Four years later, Salomon Reinach published an article about a group of [[steatite]] figurines from the caves of Balzi Rossi. The famous [[Venus of Willendorf]] was excavated in 1908 in a [[loess]] deposit in the [[Danube]] valley, [[Austria]]. Since then, hundreds of similar figurines have been discovered from the [[Pyrenees]] to the plains of [[Siberia]]. They are collectively described as "Venus figurines" in reference to the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] goddess of beauty, [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], since the [[prehistory|prehistorians]] of the early 20th century assumed they represented an ancient ideal of beauty. Early discourse on "Venus figurines" was preoccupied with identifying the race being represented and the [[steatopygous]] fascination of [[Saartjie Baartman]], the "Hottentot Venus" exhibited as a living ethnographic curiosity to connoisseurs in Paris early in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Of the mammoth-ivory figurine fragment known as ''La Poire'' ("the pear") from her massive thighs, Randall White (White 2006:263, caption to fig. 6) observed the connection.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, archaeologists from the [[University of Tübingen]] discovered a 6&amp;nbsp;cm figurine woman carved from a [[mammoth]]'s tusk, the [[Venus of Hohle Fels]],  dated to at least 35,000 years ago, representing the earliest known sculpture of this type, and the earliest known work of [[figurative art]] altogether.  The ivory carving, found in six fragments in Germany's [[Hohle Fels]] cave, represents the typical features of Venus figurines, including the swollen belly, wide-set thighs, and large breasts.&lt;ref name=Conard2009&gt;{{cite journal | last= Conard | first= Nicholas J | title= A female figurine from the basal Aurignacian of Hohle Fels Cave in southwestern Germany | journal= [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=459 | issue=  7244| pages= 248–252 | date=14 May 2009 | url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7244/pdf/nature07995.pdf | issn= | doi= 10.1038/nature07995 | accessdate= 27 July 2010  | pmid= 19444215|bibcode = 2009Natur.459..248C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cressey2009&gt;{{Cite journal |date=13 May 2009 |author=Cressey, Daniel |title=Ancient Venus rewrites history books |journal=Nature |series=News |doi=10.1038/news.2009.473 |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[Image:Vestonicka venuse edit.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Venus of Dolní Věstonice]], the earliest discovered use of ceramics&lt;ref&gt;The body used is the local [[loess]], with only traces of clay; there is no trace of surface burnishing or applied pigment. Pamela B. Vandiver, Olga Soffer, Bohuslav Klima and Jiři Svoboda, "The Origins of Ceramic Technology at Dolni Věstonice, Czechoslovakia", ''Science'', New Series, '''246''', No. 4933 (November 24, 1989:1002-1008).&lt;/ref&gt; (29,000 BCE – 25,000 BCE)]]

The majority of the Venus figurines appear to be depictions of women, many of which follow certain artistic conventions, on the lines of schematisation and stylisation. Most of them are roughly [[lozenge]]-shaped, with two tapering terminals at top (head) and bottom (legs) and the widest point in the middle (hips/belly). In some examples, certain parts of the human anatomy are exaggerated: [[abdomen]], [[hip (anatomy)|hips]], [[breast]]s, [[thigh]]s, [[vulva]]. In contrast, other anatomical details are neglected or absent, especially arms and feet. The heads are often of relatively small size and devoid of detail. Some may represent pregnant women, while others show no such signs.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 29; Fagan, 740-741; Cook; Beck, 203-213, who analyses attempts to classify the figures.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that aspects of the typical depiction and perspective, such as the large and often pendulous breasts, emphasis on the upper rather than lower buttocks, and lack of feet and faces, support the theory that these are self-portraits by women without access to mirrors, looking at their own bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Cook; McDermott, LeRoy. 1996. "Self-representation in Upper Paleolithic Female Figurines". ''Current Anthropology'' 37 (2). [University of Chicago Press, Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research]: 227–75. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2744349 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  The absence of feet has led to suggestions that the figures might have been made to stand upright by inserting the legs into the ground like a peg.

The high amount of fat around the buttocks of some of the figurines has led to numerous interpretations. The issue was first raised by Édouard Piette, excavator of the [[Brassempouy]] figure and of several other examples from the Pyrenees. Some authors saw this feature as the depiction of an actual physical property, resembling (but ''not'' depicting) the [[Khoisan]] tribe of southern [[Africa]], while others interpreted it as a symbol of fertility and abundance.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Recently, similar figurines with protruding buttocks from the prehistoric [[Jōmon period]] Japan were also interpreted as [[steatopygia]] of local women, possibly under nutritional stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hudson MJ, etal |title=Possible steatopygia in prehistoric central Japan: evidence from clay figurines |journal=Anthropological Science  |volume=116 |issue=1 |pages=87–92 |year=2008| doi=10.1537/ase.060317 |url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase/116/1/116_87/_html}}&lt;/ref&gt; (c.f.[[Jōmon Venus]])

The [[Venus of Willendorf]] and the [[Venus of Laussel]] bear traces of having been externally covered in [[red ochre]]. The significance of this is not clear, but is normally assumed to be religious or ritual in nature—perhaps symbolic of the blood of menstruation or childbirth.  Some buried human bodies were similarly covered, and the colour may just represent life.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

All generally accepted Paleolithic female figurines are from the [[Upper Palaeolithic]]. Although they were originally mostly considered [[Aurignacian]], the majority are now associated with the [[Gravettian]] and [[Solutrean]].&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740-741; Beck, 203"/&gt; In these periods, the more rotund figurines are predominant. During the [[Magdalenian]], the forms become finer with more detail; conventional stylization also develops.

==Classification==
A number of attempts to subdivide or classify the figurines have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, 208-213 analyses several&lt;/ref&gt; One of the less controversial is that by Henri Delporte, simply based on geographic provenance.&lt;ref&gt;H. Delporte : ''L’image de la femme dans l’art préhistorique'', Éd. Picard (1993) {{ISBN|2-7084-0440-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguishes:
* the Venus figurines of the [[Pyrenees]]-[[Aquitaine]] group ([[Venus of Lespugue]], of [[Venus of Laussel|Laussel]] and of [[Venus of Brassempouy|Brassempouy]])
* the Venus figurines of the Italian  group ([[Venus of Savignano]] and of Balzi Rossi)
* the Venus figurines of the [[Rhine]]-[[Danube]] group ([[Venus of Willendorf]] and of [[Venus of Dolní Věstonice|Dolní Věstonice]])
* the Venus figurines of the [[Russia]]n group ([[Kostienki]] and [[Zaraysk]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://antiquity.ac.uk/ant/082/ant0820862.htm Hizri Amirkhanov and Sergey Lev. New finds of art objects from the Upper Palaeolithic site of Zaraysk, Russia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.membrana.ru/lenta/?8913 Membrana.ru], Венеры каменного века найдены под Зарайском&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Russia]] and [[Gagarino]] in [[Ukraine]])
* the Venus figurines of the [[Siberia]]n group ([[Mal'ta Venus]], Bouret' Venus).

According to [[André Leroi-Gourhan]], there are cultural connections between all these groups. He states that certain anatomical details suggest a shared Oriental origin, followed by a westward diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;Leroi-Gourhan, A., ''Cronología del arte paleolítico'', 1966, Actas de VI Congreso internacional de Ciencias prehistóricas y protohistóricas, Roma.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==
There are many interpretations of the figurines, often based on little argument or fact.&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740-741"/&gt;

Like many prehistoric artifacts, the cultural meaning of these figures may never be known.  Archaeologists speculate, however, that they may be emblems of security and success, [[fertility]] icons, or direct representations of a [[mother goddess]]. The female figures, as part of Upper Palaeolithic portable art, appear to have no practical use in the context of [[subsistence]]. They are mostly discovered in settlement contexts, both in open-air sites and caves;&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740-741"/&gt; burial contexts are much rarer.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

At Gagarino in Russia, seven Venus figurines were found in a hut of 5 m diameter; they have been interpreted as [[apotropaic]] [[amulets]], connected with the occupants of the dwelling. [[Venus figurines of Mal'ta|At Mal'ta]], near [[Lake Baikal]] in Siberia, figurines are only known from the left sides of huts. The figurines were probably not hidden or secret amulets, but rather were displayed to be seen by all (a factor that may explain their wide geographic spread). An image of excess weight may have symbolized a yearning for  plenty and security.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Helen Benigni argues in ''The Emergence of the Goddess'' that the consistency in design of these featureless, large-breasted, often pregnant figures throughout a wide region and over a long period of time suggests they represent an archetype of a female Supreme Creator. Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age people likely connected the female as a creator innately tied to the cycles of nature: women were commonly believed to give birth and their menstrual cycles aligned with lunar cycles and tides.&lt;ref&gt;Benigni, Helen, ed.  2013.  ''The Mythology of Venus: Ancient Calendars and Archaeoastronomy''.  Lanham, Maryland : University Press Of America.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later female figurines and continuity ==
[[File:Statuette Mehrgarh.jpg|thumb|right|This figurine, c. 5500 – 2400 BCE, from [[Mehrgarh]] (in present-day Pakistan) has all of the common characteristics of a venus stone figurine]]
Some scholars and popular theorists suggest a direct continuity between the Palaeolithic female figurines and later examples of female depictions from the [[Neolithic]] or even the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Burkert, ''Homo Necans'' (1972) 1983:78, with extensive bibliography, including [[Peter Ucko|P.J. Ucko]], who contested the identification with mother goddesses and argues for a plurality of meanings, in ''Anthropomorphic Figurines of Predynastic Egypt and Neolithic Crete with Comparative Material from the Prehistoric Near East and Mainland Greece'' (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; Such views have been contested on numerous grounds, not least the general absence of such depictions during the intervening [[Mesolithic]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

A female figurine which has 'no practical use and is portable' and has the common elements of a Venus figurine (a strong accent or exaggeration of female sex linked traits, and the lack of complete lower limbs) may be considered to be a Venus figurine, even if from after the main Palaeolithic period. Figurines which match this definition, apart from date, have been found in the  [[Neolithic]] and into the [[Bronze Age]]. The period and location that a figurine came from will contribute to the opinion of a given archeologist, such that ceramic figurines from the late ceramic Neolithic may be accepted as Venus figurines, while stone figurines from later periods are not.  This is a matter of ongoing debate given the strong similarity between many figurines from the Palaeolithic, Neolithic and beyond. A reworked [[endocast]] of a [[brachiopod]] from around 6000 BC in Norway has been identified as a late Venus figurine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tidemann|first1=Grethe|title=Venus fra Svinesund|url=http://www.uniforum.uio.no/nyheter/2001/08/venus-fra-svinesund.html|website=Uniforum|publisher=[[University of Oslo]]|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This means that a given female figurine may or may not be classified as a Venus figure by any given archeologist, regardless of its date, though most archaeologists disqualify figurines which date from after the Paleolithic, even though their purpose could have been the same. For instance, the [[Mehrgarh]] figurine has all of the common characteristics of a venus stone figurine, including large breasts and incomplete legs, however it came from what is now [[Pakistan]] and also dates to 3000 BCE, which lies after the beginning of the Bronze Age.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

Wǔ Xíng is a synthesis of traditional [[painting]] with its namesake philosophic tradition [[Wu Xing|Wǔ Xíng]]&amp;nbsp;– or, more specifically, the use of Chinese Xie Yi painting techniques and the metaphysics of the five Wǔ Xíng elements. Wǔ Xíng painting also inherited some traits from several [[Wushu (term)|Wu Shu]] and [[Qi Gong]] schools. The closest in style is [[Xingyiquan]], whose 5 primary movements are balanced with the 5 elements of Wǔ Xíng. Because Wǔ Xíng painting techniques are associated foremost with [[consciousness]] and overcoming corporeal restraints, it is common to speak of the manifest [[art therapy]] influence of this method.

Because the philosophical,&lt;ref&gt;A. Scherbakov. How Wǔ Xíng Philosophical Principles are Incorporated in Wǔ Xíng Painting. "[http://usinart.ru/an-overview-of-wu-xing-painting-%e2%80%93-an-interview-with-andrey-scherbakov/]"&lt;/ref&gt; and technical components of this type of painting have been taken from [[Chinese culture]], it is common to hear it referred to as “Chinese Wǔ Xíng painting”.

Wǔ Xíng painting has a total of five brush strokes, five movements, and five types of composition, corresponding to the elements “Wood”, “Fire”, “Earth”, “Metal”, and “Water”.

Wǔ Xíng painting is [[metaphysics]]. Through Wǔ Xíng painting one can create a picture identical in its external appearance to any example of traditional [[Chinese painting]]. In this regard there is no difference between Wǔ Xíng painting and Chinese painting. Still, if one compares Wǔ Xíng painting and Guo Hua there are a number of differences in technique:
Traditional Guo Hua painting is divided into several genres: mountains and water, birds and branches, grass and insects, etc. and does not usually extend beyond these genres. Wǔ Xíng painting is not tied to any genres. Using the five brush strokes the artist can paint everything that he wants.
Traditional Chinese Guo Hua painting inherited an attachment to [[rice paper]] and [[silk]] as well as to a certain type of paint, while Wǔ Xíng has no such limitations.

The single most important thing for the artist who practices Wǔ Xíng painting is an attractive image harmoniously constructed using the Wǔ Xíng system. Everything else is secondary, including the type of artistic materials, the genre, and so on.

'''"Yusuf and Zulaikha"''' (the English transliteration of both names varies greatly) refers to a medieval Islamic version of the story of the prophet [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]] and [[Potiphar's wife]] which has been told and retold countless times in many languages spoken in [[Muslim world]], such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. Its most famous version was written in Persian language by [[Jami]] (1414-1492), in his [[Haft Awrang]] ("Seven Thrones").  The story has by then many elaborations, and is capable of a [[Sufi]] interpretation, where Zulaikha's longing for Yusuf represents the soul's quest for God.

== Other versions of the story ==
Other writers to have retold the story include: [[Mahmud Gami]] ([[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]]). It is a standard tale used in [[Punjabi Qisse]].

There exists as well a long poem on the subject, titled as Yusuf and Zalikha, which used to be attributed to [[Ferdowsi]], the great Persian poet of the tenth and eleventh century, however, the scholars have rejected this book based on its low quality and the time line of Ferdowsi's life.&lt;ref&gt;'Yusuf and Zalikha: The Biblical Legend of Joseph and Potiphar's Wife in the Persian Version Ascribed to Abul-Mansur Qasim, Called Firdausi, ca. 932-1021 A.D.,' Edited by Hermann Ethé, Philo Press, Amsterdam, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

As in many other [[Muslim]] countries, the narrative of the epic love of Yousuf and Zulaikha was covered in classic literary works of [[East Bengal]] (modern day [[Bangladesh]]): in the 14th century A.D. (during the reign of [[Sultan]] [[Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah]]), [[Shah Muhammad Sagir]] wrote in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] a version of ''[[Yusuf-Zulekha]]'' which is considered one of the greatest literary works of medieval "golden era" of [[Bengali literature]].
