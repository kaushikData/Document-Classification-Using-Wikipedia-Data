The '''AIM alliance''' was formed on October 2, 1991,&lt;!-- source says September? --&gt; between [[Apple Inc.]] (then Apple Computer), [[IBM]], and [[Motorola]] to create a new computing standard based on the [[PowerPC]] architecture.

==History==
[[Phillip Doyce Hester|Phil Hester]], a designer of the IBM [[RS/6000]], convinced IBM's president [[Jack Kuehler]] of the necessity of a [[business alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= In Pursuit of Computing's Holy Grail |author= Steve Lohr |work= The New York Times |date= May 23, 1993 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/business/in-pursuit-of-computing-s-holy-grail.html |accessdate= November 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="falters"&gt;{{Cite news |title= Computing's Bold Alliance Falters |author= [[John Markoff]] |work= The New York Times |date= September 14, 1994 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/14/business/business-technology-computing-s-bold-alliance-falters.html |accessdate= November 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1991, a historic alliance was formed between Apple and IBM with the stated goal of creating a single unifying open-standard computing platform for the whole industry, made of a new hardware design and a next-generation [[operating system]]. This would also directly challenge the dominant [[Wintel]] duopoly.

In 1992, Apple and IBM created two new companies called [[Taligent]] and [[Kaleida Labs]] as part of the alliance. Taligent was formed from a core team of Apple software engineers to create a next-generation operating system, code-named "Pink", to run on the platform. Kaleida was to create an object-oriented, cross-platform multimedia scripting language which would enable developers to create entirely new kinds of applications that would harness the power of the platform. IBM provided affinity between [[Workplace OS]] and Taligent—replacing Taligent's microkernel with the IBM Microkernel and adopting Taligent's CommonPoint application framework for Workplace OS, OS/2, and AIX.

{{quote | text=It's natural that many people saw Apple's alliance with former adversary IBM Corp. as an ominous portent for the independent future of the Macintosh. The sight of Apple and IBM chief executives gripping and grinning on national television wasn't nearly as confusing as their vow to bring the Mac and IBM desktop computers into the 21st century with shared technology such as PowerPC chips, PowerOpen Unix, and new operating software from Taligent Inc. and Kaleida Labs Inc. Present and future shock aside, that's a lot to digest.|source=''MacWeek''&lt;ref name="MacWeek Vol7 Num12"&gt;{{cite journal | magazine=[[MacWeek]] | title=Forces Gather for PowerPC Roundtable | volume=7 | issue=12 | date=March 22, 1993 | url=https://archive.org/stream/MacWEEKV07N12/MacWEEK_V07N12_djvu.txt | accessdate=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was thought that the [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] processors from Intel {{citation needed|reason=What processor?|date=June 2015}} were an evolutionary dead-end in [[microprocessor]] design,{{citation needed|reason=Who thought that?|date=June 2015}} and that since [[RISC]] was the future, the next few years were a period of great opportunity.

The CPUs are the [[PowerPC]] processors, the first of which, the [[PowerPC 601]], is a single-chip version of IBM's [[POWER1]] CPU. Both IBM and Motorola would manufacture PowerPC [[integrated circuits]] for this new platform. The computer architecture base was called "PReP" ([[PowerPC Reference Platform]]), and later complemented with [[OpenFirmware]] and renamed "CHRP" ([[Common Hardware Reference Platform]]). IBM used PReP and CHRP for [[Conventional PCI|PCI]] version of IBM's [[RS/6000]] platform, from existing [[Micro Channel architecture]] models, and changed only to support the new [[PowerPC 600#60x bus|60x bus]] style of the PowerPC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/power/library/pa-powerppl/ |title=POWER to the people |publisher=Ibm.com |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516085140/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/power/library/pa-powerppl/ |archivedate=2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The development of the PowerPC is centered at an Austin, Texas, facility called the Somerset Design Center. The building is named after the site in Arthurian legend where warring forces put aside their swords, and members of the three teams that staff the building say the spirit that inspired the name has been a key factor in the project's success thus far.|source=''MacWeek''&lt;ref name="MacWeek Vol7 Num12"&gt;{{cite journal | magazine=[[MacWeek]] | title=Forces Gather for PowerPC Roundtable | volume=7 | issue=12 | date=March 22, 1993 | url=https://archive.org/stream/MacWEEKV07N12/MacWEEK_V07N12_djvu.txt | accessdate=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|text=Part of the culture here is not to have an IBM or Motorola or Apple culture, but to have our own.|source=Motorola's Russell Stanphill, codirector of Somerset&lt;ref name="MacWeek Vol7 Num12"/&gt;}}

Efforts on the part of Motorola and IBM to popularize PReP/CHRP failed when Apple, IBM, and Taligent all failed to provide an operating system that could run on it and when Apple and IBM couldn't reach agreement on whether the reference design must or must not have a parallel port.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Although the platform was eventually supported by several [[Unix]] variants as well as [[Windows NT]] and [[Workplace OS]] (in the form of [[OS/2]]), these [[operating systems]] generally ran just as well on [[Intel]]-based hardware so there was little reason to use the PReP systems. The [[BeBox]], designed to run [[BeOS]], used some PReP hardware but as a whole was not compatible with the standard. Kaleida folded in 1995. Taligent was absorbed into IBM in 1998. Some CHRP machines shipped in 1997 and 1998 without widespread reception.

==Legacy==
The PowerPC program is the one success that came out of the AIM alliance; Apple started using PowerPC chips in the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] line starting in 1994. Almost every Mac featured a PowerPC processor from then until 2006, when the company [[Apple–Intel transition|transitioned]] entirely to [[Intel]] CPUs, due to eventual disappointment with the direction and performance of PowerPC development as of the G5 model. PowerPC also has had success in the embedded market, and all three major [[seventh-generation video game console]]s, [[Gamecube]], [[Wii]], and the [[Wii U]] feature chipsets derived from the PowerPC architecture at their core. 

[[Power.org]] was founded in 2004 by IBM and fifteen partners with intent to develop, enable, promote, and drive adoption of [[Power Architecture]] technology, such as [[PowerPC]] and [[IBM POWER microprocessors|POWER]] and applications based on them. [[Freescale]] joined in 2006 and today the consortium consists of over forty companies and institutions.

The '''Access For Learning Community''', or '''A4L''', is a global, not-for-profit corporation committed to providing solutions in the education data space and supporting the use of standards by schools, districts, states, countries, and education vendors. It has regional chapters in the US, UK, AU, and New Zealand.

It was formerly known as the '''Schools Interoperability Framework Association''', or SIFA. The name was changed in May 2015.&lt;ref name="SIFA becomes the Access For Learning Community "&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.sifassociation.org/NewsRoom/Press%20Releases/Introducing%20the%20Access%204%20Learning%20Community.pdf|title=Introducing the A4L Community|date=May 20, 2015|accessdate=November 4, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119062553/https://www.sifassociation.org/NewsRoom/Press%20Releases/Introducing%20the%20Access%204%20Learning%20Community.pdf|archivedate=2015-11-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thejournal.com/articles/2015/06/02/sif-association-remakes-itself-to-focus-on-data-usage-in-schools.aspx|title=SIF Association Remakes Itself|publisher=The Journal|date=June 2, 2015|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A4L members collaborate on a variety of technical standards sometimes collectively known as the [[Schools Interoperability Framework]].   A4L publishes these standards, and advocates their adoption and provides training and support services.  It also offers an SIF Certification trademark licensing program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://certification.sifinfo.org/ |title=SIF Certification&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224003339/http://certification.sifinfo.org/ |archive-date=2007-12-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name change to Access For Learning (A4L) represents a shift to a more solution oriented vision rather than merely advocating for the SIF specification- including using multiple standards to solve school and district problems.

The organization includes more than 1000 members as of 2015, including government agencies, school districts, public advocacy organization and vendors of [[Schools Interoperability Framework]] products.

==History==

Founded as a working group for "Schools Interoperability Framework" in 1997 by vendors under the auspices of the [[Software and Information Industry Association]]. In April 2003, SIFA was incorporated and  activities within SIF project of the SIIA were transferred to the current corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://prnwire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/04-24-2003/0001932919&amp;EDATE=|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121216104511/http://prnwire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/04-24-2003/0001932919&amp;EDATE=|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 16, 2012|title=Schools Interoperability Framework to Incorporate As Separate Non-Profit Entity|website=[[PR Newswire]]|publisher=[[Cision]]|date=April 24, 2003|accessdate=December 20, 2017|via=[[archive.is]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 20, 2015 the name of the organization was changed to the Access For Learning Community, as an indicator of a new emphasis on being over all solutions-oriented for the community rather than strictly advocating the SIF specification.

==Organization==
A4L Members elect officials every year for terms on the Association's Board of Directors. Each regional Technical Board is composed of the Lead of each A4L Project Team and Task Force and four members elected At-Large by the membership. The A4L Technical Board Members serve a one-year term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sifinfo.org/us/organization-sif.asp |title=Organization of the SIF Association |access-date=2009-06-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615114921/http://www.sifinfo.org/us/organization-sif.asp |archive-date=2009-06-15 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plough marks 2.JPG|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Score marks (ard marks) from a rip ard on a boulder in a [[clearance cairn]].]]

The '''ard''', '''ard plough''',{{refn|American English: '''ard plow'''.}} or '''scratch plough'''{{refn|American English: '''scratch plow'''.}} is a simple light [[plough]] without a [[mouldboard]]. It is symmetrical on either side of its line of draft and is fitted with a symmetrical share that traces a shallow furrow but does not invert the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Needham, ''Science and Civilization in China'', vol. 6 (1984; reprint, Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2004), 138.&lt;/ref&gt; It began to be replaced in most of Europe by the [[carruca]] [[turnplough]] from the 7th century.

In its simplest form it resembles a [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]], consisting of a ''draft-pole'' (either composite or a single piece) pierced with a nearly vertical, wooden, spiked ''head'' (or ''stock'') which is dragged through the soil by draft animals and very rarely by people. The ard-head is at one end a ''stilt'' (handle) for steering and at the other a ''share'' (cutting blade) which gouges the surface ground. More sophisticated models have a composite pole, where the section attached to the head is called the ''draft-beam'', and the share may be made of stone or iron. Some have a cross-bar for handles or two separate stilts for handles (two-handled ard). The share comes in two basic forms: a '''socket share''' slipped over the nose of the ard-head; and the '''tang share''' fitted into a groove where it is held with a clamp on the wooden head. Additionally, a slender protruding chisel (foreshare) can be fitted over the top of the mainshare.

==Use==
Rather than cutting and turning the soil to produce ridged furrows, the ard breaks up a narrow strip of soil and cuts a shallow furrow (or [[drill (agriculture)|drill]]), leaving intervening strips undisturbed.  The ard is not suited for clearing new land, so grass and undergrowth are usually removed with [[Hoe (tool)|hoes]] or [[mattock]]s. Cross-ploughing is often necessary to break the soil up better, where the soil is tilled twice at right angles to the original direction (lengthwise and across). This usually results in square or diamond-shaped fields and is effective at clearing annual weeds. The ard's shallow furrows are ideal for most [[cereal]]s, and if the seed is sown broadcast, the ard can be used to cover the seed in rows. In fact, the ard may have been invented in the [[Near East]] to cover seed rather than till. That would explain why in [[Mesopotamia]] seed drills were used together with ards. The ard is most useful on light soils such as loams or sands, or in mountain fields where the soil is thin, and can be safely used in areas where deep ploughing would turn up [[hardpan]] or would cause [[salination]] or [[erosion]].

Ards may be drawn by [[ox]]en, [[Domestic buffalo|water buffalo]], [[donkey]]s, [[camel]]s, or other animals.

==Types==
Ards come in a number of varieties.&lt;ref&gt;See the discussion in K. D. White, ''Agricultural Implements of the Roman World'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1967), 126-128.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on use, there are two kinds: the ''tilth ard'', for cutting furrows in cleared land, and the ''rip ard'', or sod buster, which has a hooked share that gouges deeper into the soil and more effectively clears virgin or [[fallow]] land. The two were in early times used in conjunction with each other. Third is the ''seed drill ard'', used specifically in [[Mesopotamia]], which added a funnel for dropping seed in the furrows as the ard cut them.

[[File:Araire à mancheron unique - schémas.svg|thumb|right|100 px|Basic ard types:&lt;br /&gt;1 - bow ard&lt;br /&gt;2 - body ard&lt;br /&gt;3 - sole ard&lt;ref&gt;Haudricourt &amp; J-Brunhes Delamarre, ''L'homme et la charrue à travers le monde''&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The earliest and most basic tilth ards are the two-piece models:
* '''bow ard''' (or '''beam ard'''), made of a bow-shaped draft-pole (or beam) originally pierced by a spear-like head (stilt &amp; share), later developing a composite body with a separate head and stilt inserted in the pole;
* '''body ard''', where the draft-pole is inserted into the thicker upward-inclined head which tapers into a handle.
The bow ard is the weaker, narrower, and probably earlier of the two. It is used for shallow tillage, normally with a tang share, in dry, stony soils. It is restricted mainly to the [[Mediterranean]] ([[Spain]], [[Tunisia]], [[Greece]], [[Turkey]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]]), [[Ethiopia]], [[Iran]], and eastern [[India]] and [[Sumatra]]. The more widespread body ard, sturdier and heavier for deeper tillage (in soils with enough moisture), usually has a socket share which is sometimes laterally extended or has serrated wings ([[Balkans]], [[Morocco]], [[Portugal]], Spain) for better mixing of soil and cutting of weeds. It had a short portion of the body which was first made to slide on the furrow bottom and gradually developed into a horizontal body. The body ard dominates in Portugal, western Spain, the Balkans, [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]], [[Japan]], and most of [[Latin America]].

The bow ard favored the development of a long horizontal sole body (slade) sliding on the ground. This led to the '''sole ard''', first attested in [[Bronze Age]] [[Cyprus]], being single-handled and consisting of a flat sole (or slade) into which were set the draft-pole and stilt, meaning there were three separate pieces. Their use in [[Agriculture in ancient Greece|Ancient Greek agriculture]] was described by [[Hesiod]].&lt;ref&gt;Signe Isager and Jens E. Skydsgaard, ''Ancient Greek Agriculture: An Introduction'', Routledge, 1995 ({{ISBN|0-415-11671-6}}) p.46&lt;/ref&gt; In northern Europe the single-handled '''crook ard''' was favored, consisting of a stilt inserted into a pole with a crook-shaft, i.e., the pole had a curved shape and had a natural crook tip that served as a share.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Halstead, "Plough and Pastoralism: Aspects of the Secondary Products Revolution", ''Pattern of the Past: Studies in Honour of David Clarke'' (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1981), 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Araire Quadrangulaire.gif|left|thumb|100px|Quadrangular ard]]
Later variations of the sole ard come in two types:  the triangular and quadrangular ards. The '''triangular ard''' has a horizontal sole body holding the beam and stilt which cross each other, forming a triangle at the base. The '''quandrangular ard''' has a horizontal sole body connected to a straight, nearly parallel beam by a stilt and a brace.

[[File:Petroglypgh Group Nordic Bronze Age 009.svg|thumb|right|Single-handled ox-drawn ard; [[Bronze Age]] rock carving, [[Bohuslän]], [[Sweden]].]]
Evidence of its use in [[prehistory]] is sometimes found at [[archaeological site]]s where the long, shallow scratches (''ard marks'') it makes can be seen cutting into the [[subsoil]]. The ard first appears in the mid-[[Neolithic]] and is closely related to the [[domestication]] of [[cattle]]. It probably spread with animal traction in general across the cereal-growing cultures of the Neolithic Old World. Its exact point of origin is unknown, but it spread quickly throughout West Asia, South Asia and Europe in the late Neolithic and early [[Chalcolithic]].

Evidence appears in the Near East in the 6th millennium&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}. Iron versions appeared {{circa|lk=no|2300}}&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} both in Assyria and 3rd-dynasty Egypt. In Europe, the earliest known wooden ard (at Lavagone in Italy) dates from around 2300-2000 {{sc|bc}}, but the earliest scratch marks date from 3500-3000&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}.&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Mallory &amp; D.Q. Adams, eds., ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'', s.v. "Plow" (London: Fitzroy-Dearborn, 1997), 435.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these were bow ards, also depicted in the rock drawings of Bohuslän, Sweden, and Fontanalba, France.

The first bow ards were likely adapted from hoes and like instruments and therefore suffered from poor balance due to their narrow bodies with only one point in the soil. This restricted their use to obstacle-free soils such as irrigated canals. The stress between body and pole was neutralized by adding a brace consisting of a fiber or leather strap between the low end of the pole and the body. The brace was later made out of wood and became important, not only on bow ards but also body ards. Today, a wooden brace between the draft-pole and upper stilt is a particular feature of body ards in Syria, central [[Iraq]], [[Turkestan]], and [[Kansu]] ([[China]]). The bow ard arrived in China as early as 3000&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, most likely arriving with [[wheat]], [[barley]], and [[hemp]] in the Lungshanoid period. Today, the bow ard is confined to minority tribes and mountainous regions,&lt;ref&gt;Needham, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; but in earlier times was widely disseminated until ousted by the [[carruca]] turnplough beginning around {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;600.

The body ard made its way east as far as northwest China via Sinkiang Province, but then underwent radical changes. A long-pole body ard with a knee-like brace is still found in western Lanchow Province. In some parts of Europe with moist soils, the body ard's path was cleared by a ''ristle'', a [[Coulter (agriculture)|coulter]]-like implement used to reach greater depth. In Spain and Portugal this remains a separate tool, but elsewhere it was the precursor to the coulter.

AFDX is a worldwide registered trademark by Airbus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://oami.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/003773108| title=AFDX| publisher=Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market| access-date=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AFDX data network is based on [[Ethernet]] technology using [[commercial off-the-shelf]] (COTS) components. The AFDX data network is a specific implementation of [[ARINC]] Specification 664 Part 7, a profiled version of an [[IEEE 802.3]] network per parts 1 &amp; 2, which defines how commercial off-the-shelf networking components will be used for future generation [[Aircraft Data Network]]s (ADN). The six primary aspects of an AFDX data network include [[full duplex]], redundancy, determinism, high speed performance, switched and profiled network.

==History==
Many commercial aircraft use the [[ARINC 429]] standard developed in 1977 for safety-critical applications. ARINC 429 utilizes a unidirectional bus with a single transmitter and up to twenty receivers. A data word consists of 32 bits communicated over a twisted pair cable using the bipolar return-to-zero modulation. There are two speeds of transmission: high speed operates at 100 kbit/s and low speed operates at 12.5 kbit/s. ARINC 429 operates in such a way that its single transmitter communicates in a point-to-point connection, thus requiring a significant amount of wiring which amounts to added weight.

Another standard, [[ARINC 629]], introduced by Boeing for the [[Boeing 777|777]] provided increased data speeds of up to 2 Mbit/s and allowing a maximum of 120 data terminals. This ADN operates without the use of a bus controller thereby increasing the reliability of the network architecture. The drawback is that it requires custom hardware which can add significant cost to the aircraft. Because of this, other manufacturers did not openly accept the ARINC 629 standard.

AFDX was designed as the next-generation aircraft data network. Basing on standards from the [[IEEE 802.3]] committee (commonly known as [[Ethernet]]) allows commercial off-the-shelf hardware to reduce costs and development time. AFDX is one implementation of deterministic Ethernet defined by ARINC Specification 664 Part 7. AFDX was developed by Airbus Industries for the A380,&lt;ref name="militaryaerospace"&gt;{{cite web

Multiple switches can be bridged together in a cascaded star topology. This type of network can significantly reduce wire runs and, thus, the overall weight of the aircraft.  In addition, AFDX can provide [[quality of service]] and dual link redundancy.

==Overview of AFDX==
AFDX adopted concepts such as the [[token bucket]] from the telecom standards, [[asynchronous transfer mode]] (ATM), to fix the shortcomings of IEEE 802.3 Ethernet. By adding key elements from ATM to those already found in Ethernet, and constraining the specification of various options, a highly reliable full-duplex deterministic network is created providing guaranteed bandwidth and quality of service (QoS).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iject.org/vol4/spl4/c0140.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of full-duplex Ethernet, the possibility of transmission collisions is eliminated. The network is designed in such a way that all critical traffic is prioritized using QoS policies so delivery, latency, and jitter are all guaranteed to be within set parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.techsat.com/fileadmin/media/pdf/infokiosk/TechSAT_TUT-AFDX-EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-03-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618140031/http://www.techsat.com/fileadmin/media/pdf/infokiosk/TechSAT_TUT-AFDX-EN.pdf |archive-date=2015-06-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A highly intelligent switch, common to the AFDX network, is able to buffer transmission and reception packets. Through the use of twisted pair or fiber optic cables, full-duplex Ethernet uses two separate pairs or strands for transmitting and receiving the data. AFDX extends standard Ethernet to provide high data integrity and deterministic timing. Further a redundant pair of networks is used to improve the system integrity (although a virtual link may be configured to use one or the other network only). It specifies interoperable functional elements at the following [[OSI model|OSI reference model]] layers:

* [[Data link layer|Data link]] ([[Media Access Control|MAC]] and virtual link addressing concept);
* [[Network Layer|Network]] ([[Internet Protocol|IP]] and [[Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]]);
* [[Transport Layer|Transport]] ([[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] and optionally [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]])
* [[Application layer|Application (network)]] (sampling, queuing, [[Service Access Point|SAP]], [[TFTP]] and [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]]).

The main elements of an AFDX network are:
* AFDX end systems
* AFDX switches
* AFDX links

==Virtual links==
The central feature of an AFDX network are its ''virtual links'' (VL). In one abstraction, it is possible to visualise the VLs as an [[ARINC 429]] style network each with one source and one or more destinations. Virtual links are unidirectional logic paths from the source end-system to all of the destination end-systems. Unlike that of a traditional Ethernet switch which switches frames based on the Ethernet destination or MAC address, AFDX routes packets using a virtual link ID, which is carried in the same position in an AFDX frame as the MAC destination address in an Ethernet frame. However, in the case of AFDX, this virtual link ID identifies the data carried rather than the physical destination. The virtual link ID is a 16-bit [[Unsigned integers|unsigned integer]] value that follows a constant 32-bit field. The switches are designed to route an incoming frame from one, and only one, end system to a predetermined set of end systems. There can be one or more receiving end systems connected within each virtual link. Each virtual link is allocated dedicated bandwidth [sum of all VL bandwidth allocation gap (BAG) rates x MTU] with the total amount of bandwidth defined by the system integrator. However, total bandwidth cannot exceed the maximum available bandwidth on the network. Bi-directional communications must therefore require the specification of a complementary VL.

Each VL is frozen in specification to ensure that the network has a designed maximum traffic, hence determinism. Also the switch, having a VL configuration table loaded, can reject any erroneous data transmission that may otherwise swamp other branches of the network. Additionally, there can be sub-virtual links (sub-VLs) that are designed to carry less critical data. Sub-virtual links are assigned to a particular virtual link. Data are read in a [[Round-robin scheduling|round-robin]] sequence among the virtual links with data to transmit. Also sub-virtual links do not provide guaranteed bandwidth or latency due to the buffering, but AFDX specifies that latency is measured from the traffic regulator function anyway.

==BAG rate==
BAG stands for bandwidth allocation gap, this is one of the main features of the AFDX protocol. This is the maximum rate data can be sent, and it is guaranteed to be sent at that interval.  When setting the BAG rate for each VL, care must be taken so there will be enough bandwidth for other VL's and the total speed cannot exceed 100 Mbit/s.

==Switching of virtual links==
Each switch has filtering, policing, and forwarding functions that should be able to process at least 4096 VLs. Therefore, in a network with multiple switches (cascaded star topology), the total number of virtual links is nearly limitless. There is no specified limit to the number of virtual links that can be handled by each end system, although this will be determined by the BAG rates and maximum frame size specified for each VL versus the Ethernet data rate. However, the number sub-VLs that may be created in a single virtual link is limited to four. The switch must also be non-blocking at the data rates that are specified by the system integrator, and in practice this may mean that the switch shall have a switching capacity that is the sum of all of its physical ports.

Since AFDX utilizes the Ethernet protocol at the MAC layer, it is possible to use high performance COTS switches with Layer 2 routing as AFDX switches for testing purposes as a cost-cutting measure. However, some features of a real AFDX switch may be missing, such as traffic policing and redundancy functions.

==Usage==
The AFDX bus is used in [[Airbus A380]], [[Boeing 787]], [[Airbus A400M]], [[Airbus A350]], [[Sukhoi Superjet 100]], [[ATR 42]], [[ATR 72]] (-600), [[AgustaWestland AW101]], [[AgustaWestland AW189]], [[AgustaWestland AW169]], [[Irkut MC-21]], [[Bombardier Global Express]], [[Bombardier CSeries]], [[Learjet 85]], [[Comac ARJ21]],&lt;ref name="AFDXwebsite"&gt;{{cite web

'''BSRIA''' (it takes its name from the initial letters of the '''Building Services Research and Information Association''') is a [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based testing, instrumentation, research and consultancy organisation, providing specialist services in [[construction]] and [[building services engineering]]. It is a not-for-profit, member-based association, with over 650 member companies; related services are delivered by a trading company, BSRIA Limited. Any profits made are invested in its research programme, producing best practice guidance.

BSRIA is a full member of the [[Construction Industry Council]].

==Structure==
BSRIA had a turnover of £11.8 million in 2010/11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About BSRIA|url=http://www.bsria.co.uk/about/|publisher=BSRIA|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It employs over 180 people at its UK head office in [[Bracknell]] as well as regionally based engineers in the UK and offices in [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Brazil]] and [[North America]].

BSRIA's mission is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BSRIA Mission |url=http://www.bsria.co.uk/about/mission/ |publisher=BSRIA |accessdate=13 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009113932/http://www.bsria.co.uk/about/mission/ |archivedate=9 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;
"to enable the building services and construction industries and their clients to enhance the value of the built environment, by improving the quality of their products and services, the efficiency of their provision and the effectiveness of their operation."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== History of BSRIA ==
BSRIA was formed in 1955 as the Heating and [[Ventilation (architecture)|Ventilating]] Research Council, later to become the Heating and Ventilating Research Association. As the industry became increasingly linked with other services so its research association and professional body saw the need to widen their remit. In 1975 the 'building services' scope was adopted, marked by the formation of the Building Services Research and Information Association, commonly shortened to BSRIA, and, in 1976, the formation of the Chartered Institution of Building Services, renamed the [[Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers]] (CIBSE) in 1985.

As the Association's activities developed to meet the needs of an integrated construction industry and to provide more than just research and information, the full name became less relevant. When new government rules required it to split research and other activities into two companies, BSRIA started formal use of the abbreviation.

Trading activities, including research, are now managed through a trading company, BSRIA Limited, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Building Services Research and Information Association, which is a company limited by guarantee. Thus, members - largely companies active in designing and delivering building services - join the Building Services Research and Information Association, and services are provided by BSRIA Limited.

[[File:Löschpapierroller.jpg|thumb|right|Blotting paper on a roll]]

'''Blotting paper''', sometimes called '''bibulous paper''', is a highly absorbent type of paper or other material. It is used to absorb an excess of liquid substances (such as ink or oil) from the surface of [[writing  paper]] or objects. Blotting paper referred to as bibulous paper is mainly used in [[microscopy]] to remove excess liquids from the slide before viewing. Blotting paper has also been sold as a cosmetic to aid in the removal of skin oils and makeup.

==Manufacture==
Blotting paper is made from different materials of varying thickness, softness, etc. depending on the application. It is often made of cotton and manufactured on special [[paper machine]]s. Blotting paper is reputed to be first referred to in the English language in the 15th century but there is a tradition in Norfolk, England that it was invented by accident at Lyng Mill on the [[River Wensum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norfolkmills.co.uk/Watermills/lyng.html Norfolk Mills - Lyng watermill]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is reported that a [[Berkshire]] (England) paper mill worker failed to add [[sizing]] to a batch of paper that was being produced. The batch was discarded. Subsequently, someone tried to write on a piece of this discarded "scrap" paper and found that it rapidly absorbed any ink applied, making it unusable for writing. Its marked absorbency having been noted, however, led to its subsequently being produced and used as blotting paper, replacing sand, which was the material that had been used for absorbing superficial wet ink. In a time when most paper was produced from "rags", red/pink rags, from which it was difficult to remove all color and had generally been discarded, were now directed to the production of blotters, hence the historically characteristic pink color of blotters.&lt;Ref&gt;From the publication Printing Art, Vol 35, p 235&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Art===
A form of blotter paper commonly known as [[Watercolor painting#Paper|watercolor paper]] is produced for its absorbent qualities, allowing much better absorption of water and pigments than standard art or drawing papers. Although usually categorized as separate from blotting paper, differences in the constituents and thickness of blotting paper and watercolor paper are subtle, and making a distinction between the two is unnecessary as the production process is nearly identical.

===Chemical analyses===
Blotting paper is used in [[chemical analysis|chemical analyses]] as stationary phase in [[thin-layer chromatography]]. Blotting paper is also used in pool/spa maintenance to measure [[pH]] balance. Small squares of blotting paper attached to disposable plastic strips are impregnated with pH sensitive compounds usually extracted from [[lichen]]s, especially [[Roccella tinctoria]]. These strips are used similarly to [[litmus]] strips, however [[filter paper]] is usually used for litmus strips, generally to allow for the property of diffusion.

===Drugs===
Drugs active in microgram range, most notably [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], are commonly distributed on blotting paper. A liquid solution of the drug is applied to the blotting paper, which commonly is perforated into individual doses and artfully decorated with what is known as blotter art. Vanity blotter is blotter art that hasn't been exposed to LSD and is usually sold as a collectible, although inevitably much of this art ends up in illegal distribution. The artwork is printed onto blotter paper and then sometimes perforated into tiny squares or "tabs" which can be torn or cut apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_images_gallery1.shtml|title = Erowid LSD (Acid) Vault : Blotter Art Examples|last = Erowid|accessdate = December 7, 2013|website = The Vaults of Erowid|archiveurl = &lt;!-- archived at archive.is on in 2012 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most blotter art designs have grid lines as part of the design to either aid in perforation or to be left as a cutting grid. Blotter as a delivery method allows for easy dosing of potent substances and easy sublingual administration of drugs which has made it increasingly popular as a preparation for other potent drugs including [[25I-NBOMe]] and [[alprazolam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.justice.gov/dea/programs/forensicsci/microgram/mg0508/mg0508.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080521082459/http://www.justice.gov/dea/programs/forensicsci/microgram/mg0508/mg0508.html | archivedate = 2008-05-21 | type = Microgram Bulletin | date = May 2008 | title = INTELLIGENCE ALERT – XANAX BLOTTER PAPER IN BARTLESVILLE, OKLAHOMA | publisher = US DEA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plain white LSD blotter without artwork is commonly referred to as WoW (White on White){{refn|group=note|"White on white refers to "white fluff", a grade of supposedly high purity LSD, on white paper.}} and is usually not perforated but rather gridded with a pen and sometimes laid on commonly obtained watercolor paper.

===Writing===
Blotting is frequently necessary when using [[dip pen]]s and occasionally when using [[fountain pen]]s. This was first done by sprinkling [[pounce (calligraphy)|pounce]] over the wet ink.

When used to remove ink from writings, the writing may appear in reverse on the surface of the blotting paper, a phenomenon which has been used as a [[plot device]] in a number of detective stories, such as in the Sherlock Holmes story [[The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Sir Arthur Conan|publisher=Georges Newnes, Ltd|location=London|year = 1905|title = The Return of Sherlock Holmes|chapterurl = http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/178/the-return-of-sherlock-holmes/3237/chapter-xi-the-adventure-of-the-missing-three-quarter/|chapter = CHAPTER XI: “THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER”|accessdate = December 7, 2013|work = Lit2Go}} &lt;!--Dead link, no book title provided, page numbers confused, ISBN search does not turn up anything. Needs a new source. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmetics===
Blotting papers are also commonly used in cosmetics to absorb excess [[sebum]] oil from the face. They are popularly marketed and have been sold by numerous cosmetic brands worldwide such as [[MAC Cosmetics|Mac]] and [[Bobbi Brown]], as well as UK high street store: [[Boots UK]]. Prices for blotting papers can range from as low as $3.00 per packet to as high as $30 or more. More affordable brands can be found by makers such as [[Clean and Clear]] and pharmacies such as [[Walgreens]] or [[CVS Pharmacy|CVS]] often carry their own brands for a reduced price. 

The papers are often dyed, for wider market appeal, and dusted with [[salicylic acid]] and minerals to actively prevent the formation of [[comedones]] and [[acne]]. However, there is a popular debate of whether blotting papers can help reduce acne by absorbing excess oil, or cause it. The quality of the blotting papers and the use of other ingredients such as [[mineral oils]] may be a determining factor.

{{refimprove|date=November 2013}}
In [[nuclear power]] technology, '''burnup''' (also known as '''fuel utilization''') is a measure of how much energy is extracted from a primary [[nuclear fuel]] source. It is measured both as the fraction of fuel atoms that underwent fission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.anl.gov/oldweb/Science_and_Technology/Poster_Tour/Posters/ACL/High-Burnup_Spent_Fuel-Bowers.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826235801/http://www.cmt.anl.gov/oldweb/Science_and_Technology/Poster_Tour/Posters/ACL/High-Burnup_Spent_Fuel-Bowers.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in %FIMA (fissions per initial metal atom) and as the actual energy released per mass of initial fuel in [[gigawatt]]-days/[[metric ton]] of [[Heavy metals|heavy metal]] (GWd/tHM), or similar units.

==Measures of burnup==
Expressed as a percentage: if 5% of the initial heavy metal atoms have undergone fission, the burnup is 5%. In reactor operations, this percentage is difficult to measure, so the alternative definition is preferred. This can be computed by multiplying the thermal power of the plant by the time of operation and dividing by the mass of the initial fuel loading. For example, if a 3000&amp;nbsp;MW thermal (equivalent to 1000&amp;nbsp;MW electric)  plant uses 24 [[tonnes]] of [[enriched uranium]] (tU) and operates at full power for 1 year, the average burnup of the fuel is (3000&amp;nbsp;MW·365 d)/24 metric tonnes = 45.63&amp;nbsp;GWd/t, or 45,625&amp;nbsp;MWd/tHM (where HM stands for heavy metal, meaning actinides like thorium, uranium, plutonium, etc.).

Converting between percent and energy/mass requires knowledge of κ, the thermal energy released per fission event. A typical value is 193.7&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|MeV]] ({{val|3.1|e=-11|ul=J}}) of thermal energy per fission (see [[Nuclear fission]]). With this value, the maximum burnup of 100%, which includes fissioning not just [[fissile]] content but also the other [[fissionable]] nuclides, is equivalent to about 909&amp;nbsp;GWd/t. Nuclear engineers often use this to roughly approximate 10% burnup as just less than 100&amp;nbsp;GWd/t.

The actual fuel may be any [[actinide]] that can support a chain reaction, including uranium, [[plutonium]], and more exotic [[transuranic]] fuels. This fuel content is often referred to as the ''heavy metal'' to distinguish it from other metals present in the fuel, such as those used for [[Cladding (nuclear fuel)|cladding]]. The heavy metal is typically present as either metal or oxide, but other compounds such as carbides or other salts are possible.

==History==

[[Generation II reactor]]s were typically designed to achieve about 40&amp;nbsp;GWd/tU. With newer fuel technology, and particularly the use of [[nuclear poison]]s, these same reactors are now capable of achieving up to 60&amp;nbsp;GWd/tU. After so many fissions have occurred, the build-up of [[fission product]]s poisons the chain reaction and the reactor must be shut down and refueled.

Some more-advanced light-water reactor designs are expected to achieve over 90&amp;nbsp;GWd/t of higher-enriched fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate= 2008-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fast-neutron reactor|Fast reactors]] are more immune to fission-product poisoning and can inherently reach higher burnups in one cycle. In 1985, the [[EBR-II]] reactor at [[Argonne National Laboratory]] took metallic fuel up to 19.9% burnup, or just under 200 GWd/t.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Deep Burn Modular Helium Reactor (DB-MHR) might reach 500&amp;nbsp;GWd/t of [[transuranic elements]].&lt;ref&gt;

In a power station, high fuel burnup is desirable for:

* Reducing downtime for refueling
* Reducing the number of fresh nuclear fuel elements required and [[spent nuclear fuel]] elements generated while producing a given amount of energy
* Reducing the potential for diversion of [[plutonium]] from spent fuel for use in [[nuclear weapon]]s

It is also desirable that burnup should be as uniform as possible both within individual fuel elements and from one element to another within a fuel charge. In reactors with [[online refuelling]], fuel elements can be repositioned during operation to help achieve this. In reactors without this facility, fine positioning of control rods to balance reactivity within the core, and repositioning of remaining fuel during shutdowns in which only part of the fuel charge is replaced may be used.

On the other hand, there are signs that increasing burnup above 50 or 60 GWd/tU leads to significant engineering challenges&lt;ref&gt;Etienne Parent. [https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/17027/54495851-MIT.pdf Nuclear Fuel Cycles for Mid-Century Deployment], MIT, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and that it does not necessarily lead to economic benefits. Higher-burnup fuels require higher initial enrichment to sustain reactivity. Since the amount of separative work units (SWUs) is not a linear function of enrichment, it is more expensive to achieve higher enrichments. There are also operational aspects of high burnup fuels&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nuclear-power.net/nuclear-power/reactor-physics/reactor-operation/fuel-burnup/|title=Fuel Burnup - Definition and Calculations|website=www.nuclear-power.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; that are associated especially with reliability of such fuel. The main concerns associated with high burnup fuels are:
* Increased burnup places additional demands on fuel cladding, which must withstand the reactor environment for longer periods.
* Longer residence in the reactor requires higher corrosion resistance.
* Higher burnup leads to higher accumulation of gaseous fission products inside the fuel pin, resulting in significant increases in internal pressure.
* Higher burnup leads to increased radiation-induced growth, which can lead to undesirable changes in core geometry (fuel assembly bow or fuel rod bow).  Fuel assembly bow can result in a increased drop times for control rods due to friction between control rods and bowed guide tubes.
* While high burnup fuel generates a smaller volume of fuel for reprocessing, the fuel has a higher specific activity.

==Fuel requirements==

In once-through [[nuclear fuel cycle]]s such as are currently in use in much of the world, used fuel elements are disposed of whole as high level nuclear waste, and the remaining uranium and plutonium content is lost. Higher burnup allows more of the fissile [[Uranium-235|&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U]] and of the plutonium bred from the [[Uranium-238|&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U]] to be utilised, reducing the uranium requirements of the fuel cycle.

==Waste==

In once-through nuclear fuel cycles, higher burnup reduces the number of elements that need to be buried. However, short-term heat emission, one [[deep geological repository]] limiting factor, is predominantly from [[medium-lived fission products]], particularly [[Cs-137|&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]] (30.08 year half life) and [[Sr-90|&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr]] (28.9 year half life). As there are proportionately more of these in high-burnup fuel, the heat generated by the spent fuel is roughly constant for a given amount of energy generated.

Similarly, in fuel cycles with [[nuclear reprocessing]], the amount of high-level waste for a given amount of energy generated is not closely related to burnup. High-burnup fuel generates a smaller volume of fuel for reprocessing, but with a higher [[specific activity]].

Unprocessed used fuel from current light-water reactors consists of 5% fission products and 95% actinides, and is dangerously radiotoxic, requiring special custody, for 300,000 years.  Most of the long-term radiotoxic elements are transuranic, and therefore could be recycled as fuel.  70% of fission products are either stable or have half lives less than one year.  Another six percent ([[Iodine-129|&lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I]] and [[Tc-99|&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc]]) can be transmuted to elements with extremely short half lives ([[Isotopes_of_iodine#List_of_isotopes|&lt;sup&gt;130&lt;/sup&gt;I]]—12.36 hours—and [[Isotopes_of_technetium#List_of_isotopes|&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;Tc]]—15.46 seconds). [[Zr-93|&lt;sup&gt;93&lt;/sup&gt;Zr]], having a very long half life, constitutes 5% of fission products, but can be alloyed with uranium and transuranics during fuel recycling, or used in cladding, where its radioactivity is irrelevant.  The remaining 20% of fission products, or 1% of unprocessed fuel, for which the longest-lived isotopes are [[Cs-137|&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]] and [[Sr-90|&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr]], require special custody for only 300 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stralsakerhetsmyndigheten.se/Global/Publikationer/Tidskrift/Nucleus/2007/Nucleus-4-2007.pdf |title=Återanvändning av långlivat avfall och sluten bränslecykel möjlig i nya reaktortyper |author=[[Janne Wallenius]] |page=15 |publisher=Nucleus |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519002715/http://www.stralsakerhetsmyndigheten.se/Global/Publikationer/Tidskrift/Nucleus/2007/Nucleus-4-2007.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, the mass of material needing special custody is 1% of the mass of unprocessed used fuel.

==Proliferation==

Burnup is one of the key factors determining the isotopic composition of [[spent nuclear fuel]], the others being its initial composition and the [[neutron spectrum]] of the reactor. Very low fuel burnup is essential for the production of [[weapons-grade plutonium]] for [[nuclear weapons]], in order to produce plutonium that is predominantly [[Plutonium 239|&lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu]] with the smallest possible proportion of [[Plutonium-240|&lt;sup&gt;240&lt;/sup&gt;Pu]] and [[Plutonium-242|&lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Pu]].

Plutonium and other transuranic isotopes are produced from uranium by neutron absorption during reactor operation. While it is possible in principle to remove plutonium from used fuel and divert it to weapons usage, in practice there are formidable obstacles to doing so. First, fission products must be removed. Second, plutonium must be separated from other actinides. Third, fissionable isotopes of plutonium must be separated from non-fissionable isotopes, which is more difficult than separating fissionable from non-fissionable isotopes of uranium, not least because the mass difference is one atomic unit instead of three. All processes require operation on strongly radioactive materials. Since there are many simpler ways to make nuclear weapons, nobody has constructed weapons from used civilian electric power reactor fuel, and it is likely that nobody ever will do so. Furthermore, most plutonium produced during operation is fissioned. To the extent that fuel is reprocessed on-site, as proposed for the [[Integral Fast Reactor]], opportunities for diversion are further limited.  Therefore, production of plutonium during civilian electric power reactor operation is not a significant problem.

== Cost ==
One 2003 MIT graduate student thesis concludes that "the fuel cycle cost associated with a burnup level of 100 GWd/tHM is higher than for a burnup of 50 GWd/tHM. In addition, expenses will be required for the development of fuels capable of sustaining such high levels of irradiation. Under current conditions, the benefits of high burnup (lower spent fuel and plutonium discharge rates, degraded plutonium isotopics) are not rewarded. Hence there is no incentive for nuclear power plant operators to invest in high burnup fuels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/17027/54495851.pdf |title=Nuclear Fuel Cycles for Mid-Century Deployment |page=81 |author=Etienne Parent |publisher=MIT |year=2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225155012/http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/17027/54495851.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study sponsored by the Nuclear Energy University Programs investigated the economic and technical feasibility, in the longer term, of higher burnup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/document/115100/neup_project_no_09-769_final_report.pdf|title=Maximum Fuel Utilization in Fast Reactors without Chemical Reprocessing|author=Ehud Greenspan|publisher=UC Berkeley|year=2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lead came cross sections02.png|thumb|Schematic depiction of H- and U-shaped lead came cross sections, with embedded glass pieces.]][[File:Newname.ext.jpg|thumb|Musée de Cluny students at work in a stained glass workshop]]
A '''came''' is a divider bar used between small pieces of [[glass]] to make a larger glazing panel.

There are two kinds of came: the H-shaped sections that hold two pieces together and the U-shaped sections that are used for the borders. Cames are mostly made of [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[brass]] or brass-capped lead.&lt;ref&gt;Art Glass Originals. (2004). ''Stained Glass for the first time.'' Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. p. 21. {{ISBN|1-4027-1361-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stevenson12&gt;Stevenson, Christine. (2004). ''Creative Stained Glass: Modern Designs &amp; Simple Techniques.'' Lark Books. p. 12. {{ISBN|1-57990-487-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the metal strips, lead is softer and more flexible, making it easier to cut and bend. The harder metals are used to work with slightly curved lines and pieces that require greater structural support. They can also be used as border came, once again for stability and support.&lt;ref name=Shannon&gt;Shannon, George and Pat Torlen. (2002). ''The new stained glass: techniques, projects, patterns, designs.'' Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. p. 51. {{ISBN|1-895569-80-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Came serves three purposes:&lt;ref name=Stevenson12/&gt;&lt;ref name=Berry10&gt;Berry, Leigh Ann. (2003). ''Basic Stained Glass Making: All the Skills and Tools You Need to Get Started.'' Stackpole Books. p. 10. {{ISBN|0-8117-2846-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# it joins the pieces of glass (the H shaped channels are used to join two pieces of glass and the U-shaped are used for the border),
# forms the lines within the glasswork and
# provides the metal to be soldered, thus joining the pieces of came.

==Came face==
Came comes in varying face sizes and shapes. They can be round, flat or colonial shaped strips. They can also be narrow or have wide faces.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Vicki. (2005). ''Traditional Leaded Glass Crafting: Projects &amp; Techniques.'' Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. p. 22. {{ISBN|1-4027-2243-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Came strips==
Came strips are 4 to 6 feet in length.The came strips can be a leaf, channel or heart came:&lt;ref name=Shannon/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berry10"/&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The leaf is the surface on either side of the came that overlaps the edges of the glass and is left exposed once the panel has been assembled. It has either a flat or rounded profile and its width is the measurement given when a came size is listed.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The channel runs the length of the came. H-shaped came has 2 back-to-back channels that hold adjoining glass pieces in position on the interior of a stained glass panel. It can also be used as a border came in certain situations. U-shaped came has only one channel and is used as a border around the perimeter of panels.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The heart is the part of the came that the glass pieces rest against inside the channel. The width of lead came pattern lines is usually 1/16 inch and allows for the thickness of the came's heart to fit between the adjoining pieces of glass."&lt;ref name=Shannon/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The width and depth of the came used to assemble the piece affect the pattern for cutting glass and for creating the finished piece.&lt;ref name=Shannon53&gt;Shannon, George and Pat Torlen. (2002).

Border cames are U-channel cames that are used on the outside edges of works. The selection of the metal of the came may vary depending upon the work. For instance, zinc may be a solid selection for free-hanging panels, because it is rigid, but lightweight. Architectural panels, on the other hand, are often enclosed in framing and therefore do not require a hard metal.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, George and Pat Torlen. (2002).

==Bumpers or lead spacers==
Bumpers, or lead spacers, are pieces of cut came strips that are left over. They can be used temporarily in the glasswork process to hold together two pieces of glass to estimate the spacing of the finished project.&lt;ref name=Stevenson12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Vicki.

A '''carbon nanothread''' (informally “diamond” nanothread) is a [[Orbital hybridisation#sp3|sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-bonded]], one-dimensional carbon crystalline [[nanomaterial]]. The tetrahedral sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-bonding of its carbon is similar to that of [[diamond]]. Nanothreads are only a few atoms across, more than 20,000 times thinner than a [[Hair|human hair]]. They consist of a stiff, strong carbon core surrounded by hydrogen atoms. [[Carbon nanotube]]s, although also one-dimensional nanomaterials, in contrast have [[Orbital hybridisation#sp2|sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-carbon]] bonding as is found in [[graphite]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;.

== Synthesis ==

Nanothreads are synthesized by compressing liquid [[benzene]] to extreme pressure of 20 GPa (around 200,000 times the pressure at the surface of the [[Earth]]), and then slowly relieving that pressure.&lt;ref name="tcfitz2014"/&gt; The mechanochemical&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; synthesis reaction can be considered a form of [[Organic chemistry|organic]] [[Solid-state chemistry|solid state]] chemistry. The benzene chains form extremely thin, tight rings of carbon that are structurally similar to diamonds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/scientists-might-accidentally-solved-hardest-155000475.html Scientists Might Have Accidentally Solved The Hardest Part Of Building Space Elevators], Business Insider, 13 October 2014, Ajai Raj&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at [[Cornell University]] have traced pathways from benzene to nanothreads, which may involve a series of organic [4+2] [[cycloaddition]] reactions along stacks of benzene molecules, followed by further reaction of unsaturated bonds.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Bo|last2=Hoffmann|first2=Roald|last3=Ashcroft|first3=N.

In contrast, [[carbon nanotube]]s form only thin crystalline ropes. Control of the rate of compression and/or decompression appears to be important to the synthesis of polycrystalline and single crystal nanothreads.&lt;ref name="tcfitz2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Slow compression/decompression may favor low energy reaction pathway(s).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &lt;nowiki/&gt; If the synthesis pressure for nanothreads can be reduced to 5 to 6 GPa, which is the pressure used for [https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/diamond/mcs-2016-diamo.pdf synthesis of industrial diamond],  production on the large scale of &gt;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; kg/yr would be possible.

The formation of nanothread crystals appears to be guided by [[Stress–strain analysis#Uniaxial stress|uniaxial stress]] (mechanical stress in a particular single direction), to which the nanothreads consistently align.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Reaction to form the crystals is not topochemical,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lauher|first=Joseph W.|last2=Fowler|first2=Frank W.|last3=Goroff|first3=Nancy S.|date=2008-09-16|title=Single-Crystal-to-Single-Crystal Topochemical Polymerizations by Design|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ar8001427|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|volume=41|issue=9|pages=1215–1229|doi=10.1021/ar8001427|issn=0001-4842}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it involves a major rearrangement from a lower symmetry [[Monoclinic crystal system|monoclinic]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; benzene crystal to a higher symmetry[[Hexagonal crystal family|hexagonal]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; nanothread crystal.  Topochemical reactions generally require commensuration between the periodicities and interatomic distances between reactant and product. The distances between benzene molecules with [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals]] separations between them must shrink by 40% or more as the short, strong [[Covalent bond|covalent]] carbon-carbon bonds between them form during the nanothread synthesis reaction. Such large changes in geometry usual break up crystal order, but the nanothread reaction instead creates it.  Even [[Crystallite|polycrystalline]] benzene reacts to form macroscopic single crystal packings of nanothreads hundreds of microns across.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Topochemical solid state reactions such as the formation of single crystal [[polydiacetylenes]] from diacetylenes usually require a single crystal reactant to form a single crystal product.

The impetus for the formation of a hexagonal crystal appears to be the packing of circular cross section threads.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The details of how it is possible to transform from a monoclinic benzene crystal to a hexagonal nanothread crystal are not yet fully understood. Further development of the theory of the effect of pressure on reactions may help.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Bo|last2=Hoffmann|first2=Roald|last3=Cammi|first3=Roberto|date=2017-09-04|title=The Effect of Pressure on Organic Reactions in Fluids—a New Theoretical Perspective|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201705427/abstract|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|language=en|volume=56|issue=37|pages=11126–11142|doi=10.1002/anie.201705427|issn=1521-3773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Diamond threads were described by Arthur C. Clarke in his novel [[The Fountains of Paradise]] in 1979. Nanothreads were first investigated theoretically in 2001 by researchers at [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State University]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stojkovic|first=Dragan|date=2001|title=Smallest Nanotube: Breaking the Symmetry of|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.125502|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=87|issue=12|doi=10.1103/physrevlett.87.125502|bibcode=2001PhRvL..87l5502S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later by researchers at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wen|first=Xiao-Dong|last2=Hoffmann|first2=Roald|last3=Ashcroft|first3=N.

== Structure ==
Since “diamond nanothreads” are sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-bonded and one-dimensional they are unique in the matrix of [[orbital hybridisation|hybridization]] (sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and dimensionality (0D/1D/2D/3D) for carbon nanomaterials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Badding|first=John V.|last2=Crespi|first2=Vincent H.|title=Synthesizing carbon nanothreads from benzene|url=http://www.spie.org/x112253.xml|journal=SPIE Newsroom|doi=10.1117/2.1201501.005713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming a topological unit cell of one or two benzene rings with at least two bonds interconnecting each adjacent pair of rings, 50 topologically distinct nanothreads have been enumerated.  15 of these are within 80 meV/carbon atom of the most stable member.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xu|first=En-shi|last2=Lammert|first2=Paul E.|last3=Crespi|first3=Vincent H.|date=2015-08-12|title=Systematic Enumeration of sp3 Nanothreads|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b01343|journal=Nano Letters|volume=15|issue=8|pages=5124–5130|doi=10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b01343|issn=1530-6984|bibcode=2015NanoL..15.5124X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more commonly discussed nanothread structures are known informally as polytwistane, tube (3,0), and Polymer I.  Polytwistane is chiral.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barua|first=Shiblee R.|last2=Quanz|first2=Henrik|last3=Olbrich|first3=Martin|last4=Schreiner|first4=Peter R.|last5=Trauner|first5=Dirk|last6=Allen|first6=Wesley D.|date=2014-02-03|title=Polytwistane|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/chem.201303081/abstract|journal=Chemistry – A European Journal|language=en|volume=20|issue=6|pages=1638–1645|doi=10.1002/chem.201303081|issn=1521-3765}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tube (3,0) can be thought of as the thinnest possible thread that can be carved out of the diamond structure, consisting of stacked cyclohexane rings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Polymer I was predicted to form from benzene at high pressure.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Although there is compelling evidence from two dimensional [[X-ray diffraction]] patterns, [[Electron diffraction#Electron diffraction in a TEM|transmission electron diffraction]], and [[solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) for a structure consisting of hexagonally packed crystals of 6.5 Angstrom diameter nanothreads with largely (75 to 80%) sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-bonding,&lt;ref name="tcfitz2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the atomic structure of nanothreads is still under investigation. Nanothreads have also been observed by [[transmission electron microscopy]].&lt;ref name="tcfitz2014" /&gt;

Nanothreads have also been classified by their degree of saturation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Fully [[Saturation (chemistry)#Organic chemistry|saturated]] degree 6 nanothreads have no [[double bond]]s remaining. Three bonds form between each pair of benzene molecules. Degree 4 nanothreads have a double bond remaining from benzene and thus only two bonds formed between each pair of benzene molecules.  Degree 2 have two double bonds remaining. Unless otherwise specified the term nanothread is assumed to refer to a degree six structure.

NMR has revealed that nanothread crystals consist of both degree 6 and degree 4 threads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duan|first=Pu|last2=Li|first2=Xiang|last3=Wang|first3=Tao|last4=Chen|first4=Bo|last5=Juhl|first5=Stephen J.|last6=Koeplinger|first6=Daniel|last7=Crespi|first7=Vincent H.|last8=Badding|first8=John V.|last9=Schmidt-Rohr|first9=Klaus|date=2018-05-29|title=The Chemical Structure of Carbon Nanothreads Analyzed by Advanced Solid-State NMR|url=https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b03733|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|language=en|doi=10.1021/jacs.8b03733|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, spin diffusion experiments show that the sections of the threads that are fully saturated degree 6 must be at least 2.5 nm long, if not longer.  NMR also shows that no second hydrocarbon or carbon phase is present in nanothread crystals.  Thus all of the sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; carbon is either in degree 4 nanothreads or small amounts of aromatic linker molecules, or even smaller amounts of C=O groups. NMR provides the chemical structural information necessary to refine syntheses towards pure degree 6 nanothreads.

==Carbon nitride nanothreads==
Pyridine compressed slowly under pressure forms carbon nitride C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N nanothread crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Xiang|last2=Wang|first2=Tao|last3=Duan|first3=Pu|last4=Baldini|first4=Maria|last5=Huang|first5=Haw-Tyng|last6=Chen|first6=Bo|last7=Juhl|first7=Stephen J.|last8=Koeplinger|first8=Daniel|last9=Crespi|first9=Vincent H.|date=2018-03-23|title=Carbon Nitride Nanothread Crystals Derived from Pyridine|url=https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b13247|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|doi=10.1021/jacs.7b13247|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; They exhibit the six-fold diffraction "signature" of nanothread formation.  NMR, chemical analysis and infrared spectroscopy provide further evidence for the synthesis of nanothreads from pyridine. Pyridine nanothreads incorporate significant amounts of nitrogen directly into their backbone. In contrast sp2 carbon nanotubes can only be doped with a small amount of nitrogen. A wide range of other functionalized nanothreads may be possible.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Properties ==
Every type of nanothread has a very high [[Young's modulus]] (stiffness). The value for the strongest type of nanothread is around 900 [[GPa]] compared to steel at 200 GPa and diamond at over 1,200 GPa.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Super-Strong Diamond Nanothread Has People Dreaming Of A Space Elevator|url = http://www.iflscience.com/technology/super-strong-diamond-nano-thread-could-make-your-carbon-nanotubes-dreams-reality|website = IFLScience|accessdate = 2015-11-29|date = November 28, 2015|first = Alfredo|last = Carpineti}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strength carbon nanothreads may rival or exceed that of [[carbon nanotubes]] (CNTs). [[Molecular dynamics]] simulations have indicated a stiffness on the order of carbon nanotubes (approx. 850 GPa) and a specific strength of approx. 4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; N·m/kg.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Roman, R. Kwan, K., and Cranford, S.W., [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/nl5041012 Mechanical Properties and Defect Sensitivity of Diamond Nanothreads], [[Nano Letters]], Feb. 18, 2015, 15 (3), pp 1585–1590&lt;/ref&gt;

Much as graphite [[Intercalation (chemistry)#Exfoliation|exfoliates]] into sheets and ultimately [[graphene]], nanothread crystals exfoliate into fibers, consistent with their structure consisting of stiff, straight threads with a persistence length of ~100&amp;nbsp;nm&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; that are held together with van der Waals forces. These fibers exhibit [[birefringence]], as would be expected from their low dimensional character.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In contrast, most polymers are much more flexible and often fold into crystalline lamella (see [[Crystallization of polymers]]) rather than forming into crystals that readily exfoliate.

Modeling suggests certain nanothreads may be auxetic, with a negative [[Poisson's ratio|Poisson ratio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saha|first=Biswajit|last2=Pratik|first2=Saied Md.|last3=Datta|first3=Ayan|date=2017-09-18|title=Coexistence of Normal and Auxetic Behavior in a Thermally and Chemically Stable sp3 Nanothread: Poly[5]asterane|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/chem.201702775/abstract|journal=Chemistry – A European Journal|language=en|volume=23|issue=52|pages=12917–12923|doi=10.1002/chem.201702775|issn=1521-3765}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[thermal conductivity]] of nanothreads has been modeled.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-32-346240-2.00007-8|title=Thermal Conductivity of Diamond Nanothread|last=Zhan|first=Haifei|last2=Gu|first2=Yuantong|pages=185–204|doi=10.1016/b978-0-32-346240-2.00007-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhan|first=Haifei|last2=Zhang|first2=Gang|last3=Zhang|first3=Yingyan|last4=Tan|first4=V.B.C.|last5=Bell|first5=John M.|last6=Gu|first6=Yuantong|title=Thermal conductivity of a new carbon nanotube analog: The diamond nanothread|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.11.012|journal=Carbon|volume=98|pages=232–237|doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2015.11.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Taishan|last2=Ertekin|first2=Elif|date=2016-04-11|title=Generalized Debye-Peierls/Allen-Feldman model for the lattice thermal conductivity of low-dimensional and disordered materials|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.93.155414|journal=Physical Review B|volume=93|issue=15|pages=155414|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.93.155414|arxiv=1602.02419|bibcode=2016PhRvB..93o5414Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modeling indicates their [[Band gap|Bandgaps]]  are tunable with strain over a wide range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Weikang|last2=Tai|first2=Bo|last3=Guan|first3=Shan|last4=Yang|first4=Shengyuan A.|last5=Zhang|first5=Gang|date=2018-02-08|title=Hybrid Structures and Strain-Tunable Electronic Properties of Carbon Nanothreads|url=https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b11549|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry C|volume=122|issue=5|pages=3101–3106|doi=10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b11549|issn=1932-7447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential applications==
Nanothreads can be thought of essentially as "flexible diamond". The extremely high specific strength predicted for them by modeling has attracted attention for applications such as [[space elevator]]s and would be useful in other applications related to transportation, aerospace, and sports equipment.  They may uniquely combine extreme strength, flexibility, and resilience.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhan|first=Haifei|last2=Zhang|first2=Gang|last3=Tan|first3=Vincent B.

The “extra” bond usually formed to hydrogen could be instead be linked to another nanothread or another molecule or atom.&lt;ref name="tcfitz2014" /&gt; Nanothreads may thus be thought of as "hybrids" that are both hydrocarbon molecules and carbon nanomaterials. Bonds to carbon nanotubes require their carbon to change from near planar sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-bonding to tetrahedral sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-bonding, thus disrupting their tubular geometry and possibly weakening them.  Nanothreads may be less susceptible to loss of strength through defects than carbon nanotubes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Thus far the extreme strength predicted for carbon nanotubes has largely not been realized in practical applications because of issues with load transfer to the surroundings and defects at various length scales from that of atoms on up.

Exfoliation into individual nanothreads may be possible, facilitating further functionalization and assembly into functional materials.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The carbon core of nanothreads is very stiff relative to the backbone of conventional polymers. They should thus be able to precisely orient molecular functions attached along their length (by substitution of hydrogen) relative to each other and to heteoatoms or unsaturated bonds in their backbone. These features may enable biological applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hong|first=Guosong|last2=Diao|first2=Shuo|last3=Antaris|first3=Alexander L.|last4=Dai|first4=Hongjie|date=2015-10-14|title=Carbon Nanomaterials for Biological Imaging and Nanomedicinal Therapy|url=https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00008|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=115|issue=19|pages=10816–10906|doi=10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00008|issn=0009-2665}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example.

[[Image:IT8target.jpg|right|thumb|300px|An IT8.7 Target by [[LaserSoft Imaging]] used for [[color management]] of digital cameras or scanners.]]
[[File:Color chips 2.jpg|thumb|220px|Color chips or color samples from a [[microplastics|plastic pellet]] manufacturer that enables customers to evaluate the color range as molded objects to see final effects]]
A '''color chart''' or '''color reference card''' is a flat, physical object that has many different [[color]] samples present. They can be available as a one-page chart, or in the form of swatchbooks or color-matching fans.

Typically there are two different types of color charts:
* '''Color reference charts''' are intended for color comparisons and measurements. Typical tasks for such charts are checking the color reproduction of an imaging system, aiding in [[color management]] or visually determining the hue of color. Examples are the [[IT8]] and [[ColorChecker]] charts.
* '''Color selection charts''' present a palette of available colors to aid the selection of [[spot color]]s, process colors, [[paint]]s, pens, crayons, and so on – usually the colors are from a manufacturers product range. Examples are the [[Pantone]] and [[RAL colour standard|RAL]] systems.

== Color reference charts ==
Color reference charts are used for color comparisons and measurements such as checking the color reproduction of an imaging system, and calibration and/or profiling of digital input devices such as digital cameras, and scanners and output display systems like printers, monitors and projectors. They are also used by traditional photographers and cinematographers to calibrate cameras that use film and to check the color temperature of the lighting.

Color reference cards can also be used to assess light quality, as in the [[color rendering index]], where reflectance from a set of  [[Munsell color system|Munsell]]  samples are evaluated.

[[File:Felix von Luschan Skin Color chart.svg|thumb|centre|The [[Von Luschan's chromatic scale]] for classifying skin color.]]

=== Shirley cards ===

Shirley cards are color reference cards that are used to perform skin-color balance in still photography printing. The industry standard for these cards in North American photography labs in the 1940s and 1950s depicted a solitary "Caucasian" female dressed in brightly colored clothes. Very few of these color reference cards showed an adult male as the reference image.&lt;ref name=Roth&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roth|first=Lorna|title=Looking at Shirley, the Ultimate Norm: Colour Balance, Image Technologies, and Cognitive Equity|journal=Canadian Journal of Communication|date=March 28, 2009|volume=34|issue=1|url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/2196|accessdate=November 4, 2013|publisher=Canadian Journal of Communication/CCSP Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Light skin tones therefore served as the recognized skin ideal standard. Stock color film chemistry for still cameras was designed originally with a positive bias toward "Caucasian" skin tones because of its high level of reflectivity.&lt;ref name=Roth /&gt;

By the mid-1990s, Japanese companies redesigned their Shirley cards using data from their own color preference tests. The new reference card featured Japanese women with light yellow skin.&lt;ref name=Roth /&gt;

In 1995, [[Kodak]] designed a multiracial norm reference card. This card showed three women (Caucasian, Asian, African) with different skin colors and brightly contrasted clothing.&lt;ref name=Roth /&gt;

A similar cinematic calibration technique is known as the [[China Girl (filmmaking)|China Girl]].

=== ColorChecker charts ===
{{main|ColorChecker}}

The [[ColorChecker]]—first produced as the “Macbeth ColorChecker” in 1976—a cardboard-framed arrangement of twenty-four squares of painted samples based on [[Munsell color system|Munsell]] colors. Its previous maker [[Gretag–Macbeth]] was acquired in 2006 by [[X-Rite]].
[[Image:Gretag-Macbeth ColorChecker.jpg|centre|thumb|ColorChecker Color Rendition Chart]]

A ColorChecker chart can be used to manually adjust color parameters (e.g. color temperature) to achieve a desired color rendition. ColorChecker charts are available in different sizes and forms.

=== IT8 charts ===
{{main|IT8}}
Standardized [[IT8|IT8 charts]] (also called IT8 targets) are made by several companies including Coloraid.de, [[FujiFilm]], [[Kodak]], [[LaserSoft Imaging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.computer-darkroom.com/it8cal/it8_page_1.htm | title = IT8 Calibration Targets: Does cost really make a difference? | author = Ian Lyons | publisher = Computer Darkroom }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike ColorChecker charts, IT8 charts are supplied with measurement values and can be used to create [[ICC profile|ICC color profiles]] by software (e.g. for digital cameras) to create reproducible [[color management]].
[[File:IT8 color target by EGM Laboratories.jpg|thumb|center|This is an IT8 color target made in EGM Laboratories in Barcelona, Spain. It has a very big [[gamut]], slightly bigger than the [[ProPhoto RGB color space|ProPhoto color space]].]]

=== Other ===
Color charts can take custom forms, as for example the calibration target used by the [[Curiosity rover]] for its Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI).
[[File:PIA16132-MarsCuriosityRover-CalibrationTarget-20120909.jpg|thumb|centre|(Image courtesy of JPL)&lt;br/&gt;''Calibration Target'' on the [[Mars]] [[Curiosity rover]] ([http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/images/MAHLIcaltarget-br2.jpg 3-D image]).]]

== Color selection charts ==
Because paints and inks depend for their color on [[pigment]]s and [[dye]]s, a reference is needed to match specific combinations of coloring substances in a given matrix against the resulting color. One of the earliest attempts to achieve this goal was the 1692 manuscript [[Klaer Lightende Spiegel der Verfkonst]].  It presented a range of watercolor mixtures, but remained relatively unknown, because only one manuscript was produced.  Due to the development of the paint and ink industry, the requirement for this kind of chart intensified, and a number of systems are now available, including:
* "DIC Color System Guide" and "[[Toyo Ink|Toyo]] Color Finder," commonly used for [[spot color]] matching, mostly in Japan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Columbia Guide to Digital Publishing | author = William E. Kasdorf | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-231-12498-0 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fobHSO6GlZAC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;dq=dic+color+guide&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=N7JNSfujDp3wkQTn-PmJCg }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Natural Color System|NCS Palette]] (Natural Color System)
* [[Pantone]], used for printing and sometimes for paint, fabric, and plastics
* [[RAL (color space system)|RAL]] (Reichsausschuß für Lieferbedingungen) "Classic", "Effect", and "Design," used for varnish and powder coating

In [[engineering]], a '''corner case''' (or '''pathological case''') involves a problem or situation that occurs only outside of normal operating [[parameter]]s—specifically one that manifests itself when multiple environmental variables or conditions are simultaneously at extreme levels, even though each parameter is within the specified range for that parameter.

For example, a loudspeaker might distort audio, but only when played at maximum volume, maximum [[Bass (sound)|bass]], and in a [[Humidity|high-humidity]] environment. Or a [[Server (computing)|computer server]] may be unreliable, but only with the maximum complement of 64 [[Microprocessor|processors]], 512 [[Gigabyte|GB]] of [[Computer memory|memory]], and 10,000 signed-on [[User (computing)|users]].

Contrast a corner case with an [[edge case]], the latter an issue that occurs only at a (single) maximum or minimum parameter. For example, a speaker may distort audio at maximum volume, even in the absence of other extreme settings or conditions.

Corner cases form part of an [[engineer]]'s lexicon—especially an engineer involved in testing or [[debugging]] a complex system. Corner cases are often harder and more expensive to reproduce, test, and optimize because they require maximal configurations in multiple dimensions. They are frequently less-tested, given the belief that few product users will, in practice, exercise the product at multiple simultaneous maximum settings. Expert users of systems therefore routinely find corner case anomalies, and in many of these, errors.

The term "corner case" comes about by physical analogy with "edge case" as an extension of the "[[flight envelope]]" metaphor to a set of testing conditions whose boundaries are determined by the 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; combinations of extreme (minimum and maximum) values for the number ''n'' of variables being tested, ''i.e.'', the total [[parameter space]] for those variables. Where an edge case involves pushing one variable to a minimum or maximum, putting users at the "edge" of the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], a corner case involves doing so with multiple variables, which would put users at a "corner" of a multidimensional configuration space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/125587/what-are-the-difference-between-an-edge-case-a-corner-case-a-base-case-and-a-b|title=What are the difference between an edge case, a corner case, a base case and a boundary case?|website=Software Engineering Stack Exchange|accessdate=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Dodge received a [[bachelor of science]] from the [[University of Southern Maine]], majoring in [[accounting]]. Afterward, he received an [[MBA]] from New Hampshire College (now [[Southern New Hampshire University]]). Following graduation, Dodge worked at a number of technology companies, including [[Digital Equipment]], [[Forte Software]], [[AltaVista]], [[Napster]], and [[Bowstreet]]. Afterward, he worked at [[Groove Networks]]. When the company was acquired by Microsoft, Dodge became Director of Business Development for Microsoft's Emerging Business Team. He was also known as a "start-up [[Technology evangelist|evangelist]]" for Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/insideBusop.htm?f=2009/december/29/chinwong.isx&amp;d=/2009/december/29 "Would you fire Steve Ballmer?"]. ''Manila Standard Today''. Retrieved July 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Focusing on the [[New England]] area and based in [[New Hampshire]],&lt;ref name=boston /&gt; Dodge often worked specifically with companies in the greater [[Boston]] area, to help them use Microsoft products for their companies.&lt;ref name=tcn /&gt; Dodge felt positively towards [[Ray Ozzie]], CEO of Groove Networks, whom replaced [[Bill Gates]] as [[Chief Software Architect]] at Microsoft following Gates' retirement announcement.&lt;ref&gt;"In giant footsteps". ''Financial Times''. June 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dodge was laid off from Microsoft on November 5, 2009,&lt;ref name=cuts /&gt; and then he became a Developer Advocate for Google,&lt;ref&gt;"Startup guru Don Dodge among Microsoft layoffs".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8731">'''Electromagnetic field solvers''' (or sometimes just '''field solvers''') are specialized programs that solve (a subset of) [[Maxwell's equations]] directly.  They form a part of the field of [[electronic design automation]], or EDA, and are commonly used in the design of [[integrated circuit]]s and [[printed circuit board]]s.    They are used when a solution from first principles is needed, or the highest accuracy is required.

== Introduction ==

The [[parasitic extraction|extraction of parasitic circuit models]] is important for various aspects of physical
verification such as [[static timing analysis|timing]], [[signal integrity]], [[substrate coupling]], and power grid analysis. As circuit
speeds and densities have increased, the need has grown to account accurately for
parasitic effects for larger and more complicated interconnect structures. In addition, the
electromagnetic complexity has grown as well, from [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] and [[capacitance]], to [[inductance]],
and now even full [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic wave]] propagation. This increase in complexity
has also grown for the analysis of passive devices such as integrated inductors.
Electromagnetic behavior is governed by [[Maxwell's equations]], and all [[layout extraction|parasitic extraction]]
requires solving some form of [[Maxwell's equations]]. That form may be a simple
analytic parallel plate capacitance equation, or may involve a full numerical solution for a
complicated 3D [[geometry]] with wave propagation. In [[layout extraction]],
analytic formulas for simple or simplified geometry can be used where
accuracy is less important than speed, but when the geometric configuration is not simple
and accuracy demands do not allow simplification, numerical solution of the appropriate
form of [[Maxwell's equations]] must be employed.

The appropriate form of [[Maxwell's equations]] is typically solved by one of two classes
of methods. The first uses a differential form of the governing equations and requires the
discretization (meshing) of the entire domain in which the electromagnetic fields reside.
Two of the most common approaches in this first class are the [[finite difference]] (FD) and
[[finite element]] (FEM) method. The resultant linear algebraic system (matrix) that must
be solved is large but [[sparse matrix|sparse]] (contains very few non-zero entries). Sparse linear solution
methods, such as sparse factorization, conjugate-gradient, or [[multigrid method]]s can be
used to solve these systems, the best of which require CPU time and memory of O(N)
time, where N is the number of elements in the discretization. However most problems
in [[electronic design automation]] (EDA) are open problems, also called exterior problems,
and since the fields decrease slowly towards infinity, these methods can require extremely
large N.

The second class of methods are integral equation methods which instead require a
discretization of only the sources of electromagnetic field. Those sources can be physical
quantities, such as the surface charge density for the capacitance problem, or mathematical
abstractions resulting from the application of Green's theorem. When the sources exist
only on two-dimensional surfaces for three-dimensional problems, the method is often
called a [[boundary element method]] (BEM). For open problems, the sources of the field
exist in a much smaller domain than the fields themselves, and thus the size of linear
systems generated by integral equations methods are much smaller than FD or FEM.
Integral equation methods, however, generate dense (all entries are nonzero) linear systems
which makes such methods preferable to FD or FEM only for small problems. Such
systems require ''O(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)'' memory to store and ''O(n&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)'' to solve via direct Gaussian elimination
or at best ''O(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)'' if solved iteratively. Increasing circuit speeds and densities require
the solution of increasingly complicated interconnect, making dense integral equation approaches
unsuitable due to these high growth rates of computational cost with increasing
problem size.

In the past two decades, much work has gone into improving both the differential and integral
equation approaches, as well as new approaches based on [[random walk]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;Y. L. Le Coz and R. B. Iverson. A stochastic algorithm for high speed capacitance extraction in integrated

have become particularly popular for interconnect extraction due to sparsification techniques,

In the IC industry, sparsified integral equation techniques are typically used to
solve capacitance and inductance extraction problems. The random-walk methods have
become quite mature for capacitance extraction. For problems requiring the solution of
the full [[Maxwell's equations]] (full-wave), both differential and integral equation approaches
are common.

'''Etching''' is used in [[microfabrication]] to chemically remove layers from the surface of a [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]] during manufacturing.  Etching is a critically important process module, and every wafer undergoes many etching steps before it is complete.  

For many etch steps, part of the wafer is protected from the etchant by a "masking" material which resists etching.  In some cases, the masking material is a [[photoresist]] which has been patterned using [[photolithography]].  Other situations require a more durable mask, such as [[silicon nitride]].

== Figures of merit ==
If the etch is intended to make a cavity in a material, the depth of the cavity may be controlled approximately using the etching time and the known etch rate.  More often, though, etching must entirely remove the top layer of a multilayer structure, without damaging the underlying or masking layers.  The etching system's ability to do this depends on the ratio of etch rates in the two materials (''selectivity'').

Some etches [[undercut (manufacturing)|undercut]] the masking layer and form cavities with sloping sidewalls.  The distance of undercutting is called ''bias''.  Etchants with large bias are called ''[[isotropic]]'', because they erode the substrate equally in all directions.  Modern processes greatly prefer anisotropic etches, because they produce sharp, well-controlled features.

== Etching media and technology ==
The two fundamental types of etchants are [[liquid]]-phase ("wet") and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]-phase ("dry").  Each of these exists in several varieties.

[[File:Etching, simplified animation of etchant action on a copper sheet with mask.gif|Etching, simplified animation of etchant action on a copper sheet with mask]]

=== Wet etching ===
[[Image:1886VE10-HD.jpg|thumb|Radiation hardened [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] of the 1886VE10 [[microcontroller]] prior to [[Metallizing|metalization]] etching]]
[[Image:1886VE10-Si-HD.jpg|thumb|Radiation hardened [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] of the 1886VE10 [[microcontroller]] after a [[Metallizing|metalization]] etching process has been used]]

The first etching processes used [[liquid]]-phase ("wet") etchants.  The wafer can be immersed in a bath of etchant, which must be agitated to achieve good process control.  For instance, [[Buffered Oxide Etch|buffered hydrofluoric acid]] (BHF) is used commonly to etch [[silicon dioxide]] over a [[silicon]] substrate. 

Different specialised etchants can be used to characterise the surface etched.

Wet etchants are usually isotropic, which leads to large bias when etching thick films.  They also require the disposal of large amounts of toxic waste.  For these reasons, they are seldom used in state-of-the-art processes.  However, the [[photographic developer]] used for [[photoresist]] resembles wet etching.

As an alternative to immersion, single wafer machines use the [[Bernoulli principle]] to employ a gas (usually, pure [[nitrogen]]) to cushion and protect one side of the wafer while etchant is applied to the other side.  It can be done to either the front side or back side.  The etch chemistry is dispensed on the top side when in the machine and the bottom side is not affected. This etch method is particularly effective just before "backend" processing ([[BEOL]]), where wafers are normally very much thinner after [[wafer backgrinding]], and very sensitive to thermal or mechanical stress. Etching a thin layer of even a few micrometres will remove microcracks produced during backgrinding resulting in the wafer having dramatically increased strength and flexibility without breaking.

=== Anisotropic wet etching (Orientation dependent etching) ===
[[File:Anisotropic wet etching.svg|thumb|An anisotropic wet etch on a silicon wafer creates a cavity with a trapezoidal cross-section.  The bottom of the cavity is a {100} plane (see [[Miller indices]]), and the sides are {111} planes.  The blue material is an etch mask, and the green material is silicon.]]
Some wet etchants etch [[crystal]]line materials at very different rates depending upon which crystal face is exposed.  In single-crystal materials (e.g. silicon wafers), this effect can allow very high anisotropy, as shown in the figure. The term "crystallographic etching" is synonymous with "anisotropic etching along crystal planes". 

However, for some non-crystal materials like glass, there are unconventional ways to etch in an anisotropic manner.&lt;ref name="X. Mu "&gt;X. Mu, ''et al''. Laminar Flow used as "Liquid Etching Mask" in Wet Chemical Etching to Generate Glass Microstructures with an Improved Aspect Ratio. ''Lab on a Chip'', '''2009''', 9: 1994-1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors employs multistream laminar flow that contains etching non-etching solutions to fabricate a glass groove. The etching solution at the center is flanked by non-etching solutions and the area contacting etching solutions is limited by the surrounding non-etching solutions. Thereby, the direction of etching is mainly vertical to the surface of glass. The SEM images demonstrate the breaking of conventional theoretical limit of aspect ratio (width/height=0.5) and contribute a two-fold improvement (width/height=1).

Several anisotropic wet etchants are available for silicon, all of them hot aqueous caustics.  For instance, [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) displays an etch rate selectivity 400 times higher in &lt;100&gt;  crystal directions than in &lt;111&gt; directions.  EDP (an [[aqueous]] solution of [[ethylene diamine]] and [[pyrocatechol]]), displays a &lt;100&gt;/&lt;111&gt; selectivity of 17X, does not etch silicon dioxide as KOH does, and also displays high selectivity between lightly [[doping (semiconductors)|doped]] and heavily boron-doped (p-type) silicon.  Use of these etchants on wafers that already contain [[CMOS]] [[integrated circuit]]s requires protecting the circuitry.   KOH may introduce mobile [[potassium]] ions into [[silicon dioxide]], and EDP is highly [[corrosive]] and [[cancer causing|carcinogenic]], so care is required in their use.  [[Tetramethylammonium hydroxide]] (TMAH) presents a safer alternative than EDP, with a 37X selectivity between {100} and {111} planes in silicon.

Etching a (100) silicon surface through a rectangular hole in a masking material, for example a hole in a layer of silicon nitride, creates a pit with flat sloping  {111}-oriented sidewalls and a flat (100)-oriented bottom. The {111}-oriented sidewalls have an angle to the surface of the wafer of:

::&lt;math&gt;\arctan\sqrt{2}=54.7^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

If the etching is continued "to completion", i.e. until the flat bottom disappears, the pit becomes a trench with a V-shaped cross section. If the original rectangle was a perfect square, the pit when etched to completion displays a pyramidal shape.

The undercut, ''δ'', under an edge of the masking material is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;\delta = \frac{\sqrt{6} D}{S}=\frac{\sqrt{6} R_{100}T}{R_{100}/R_{111}}=\sqrt{6}TR_{111}&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''R''&lt;sub&gt;xxx&lt;/sub&gt; is the etch rate in the &lt;xxx&gt; direction, ''T'' is the etch time, ''D'' is the etch depth and ''S'' is the anisotropy of the material and etchant.

Different etchants have different anisotropies. Below is a table of common anisotropic etchants for silicon:

=== Plasma etching ===
[[File:Photolithography etching process.svg|thumb|140px|Simplified illustration of dry etching using positive photoresist during a photolithography process in semiconductor microfabrication. Note: Not to scale.]]
Modern [[Very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] processes avoid wet etching, and use ''[[plasma etching]]'' instead.  [[Plasma etcher]]s can operate in several modes by adjusting the parameters of the plasma.  Ordinary plasma etching operates between 0.1 and 5 [[Torr]].  (This unit of pressure, commonly used in vacuum engineering, equals approximately 133.3 [[pascal (unit)|pascal]]s.)  The plasma produces energetic [[free radical]]s, neutrally [[electric charge|charge]]d, that react at the surface of the wafer.  Since neutral particles attack the wafer from all angles, this process is isotropic.

Plasma etching can be isotropic, i.e., exhibiting a lateral undercut rate on a patterned surface approximately the same as its downward etch rate, or can be anisotropic, i.e., exhibiting a smaller lateral undercut rate than its downward etch rate. Such anisotropy is maximized in [[deep reactive ion etching]]. The use of the term anisotropy for plasma etching should not be conflated with the use of the same term when referring to orientation-dependent etching.

The source gas for the plasma usually contains small molecules rich in [[chlorine]] or [[fluorine]].  For instance, [[carbon tetrachloride]] (CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) etches silicon and [[aluminium]], and [[trifluoromethane]] etches [[silicon dioxide]] and [[silicon nitride]].  A plasma containing [[oxygen]] is used to [[oxidize]] ("[[plasma ashing|ash]]") photoresist and facilitate its removal.

''Ion milling'', or ''sputter etching'', uses lower pressures, often as low as 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; Torr (10 mPa).  It bombards the wafer with energetic ions of [[noble gas]]es, often [[argon|Ar]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which knock atoms from the substrate by transferring [[momentum]].  Because the etching is performed by ions, which approach the wafer approximately from one direction, this process is highly anisotropic.  On the other hand, it tends to display poor selectivity.  ''[[Reactive-ion etching]]'' (RIE) operates under conditions intermediate between sputter and plasma etching (between 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Torr).  ''[[Deep reactive-ion etching]]'' (DRIE) modifies the RIE technique to produce deep, narrow features.

'''Flight envelope protection''' is a [[human machine interface]] extension of an [[Aircraft flight control systems|aircraft’s control]] system that prevents the pilot of an aircraft from making control commands that would force the aircraft to exceed its structural and aerodynamic operating limits.&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;Pratt, R. (2000). Flight control systems: practical issues in design and implementation. Institution of Electrical Engineers. {{ISBN|978-0-85296-766-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abzug"&gt;Abzug MJ, Larrabee EE. (2002).

(2001). Controlling Pilot Error: Automation. McGraw-Hill Professional. {{ISBN|978-0-07-137320-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in some form in all modern commercial [[fly-by-wire]] aircraft.&lt;ref name="North"&gt;North, David. (2000) "Finding Common Ground in Envelope Protection Systems". ''Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology'',  Aug 28, pp. 66–68.&lt;/ref&gt; The professed advantage of flight envelope protection systems is that they restrict a pilot's excessive control inputs, whether in surprise reaction to emergencies or otherwise, from translating into excessive [[flight control surface]] movements. Notionally, this allows pilots to react quickly to an emergency while blunting the effect of an excessive control input resulting from "startle," by electronically limiting excessive control surface movements that could over-stress the airframe and endanger the safety of the aircraft.&lt;ref name="Waldrop"&gt;Waldrop MM. (1989). Flying the Electric Skies. Science, 244: 1532-1534. {{JSTOR|1704109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alizart R. Fulford GA. (1989) Electric Airliners. Science, 245: 581-583. {{JSTOR|1704444}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, these limitations have sometimes resulted in unintended [[human factors]] errors and accidents of their own.

==Function==
Aircraft have a [[flight envelope]] that describes its safe performance limits in regard to such things as minimum and maximum operating speeds, and its operating structural strength.&lt;ref name="Pratt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abzug"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Risukhin"/&gt; Flight envelope protection calculates that flight envelope (and adds a margin of safety) and uses this information to stop [[aviator|pilots]] from making control inputs that would put the aircraft outside that flight envelope.&lt;ref name="Waldrop"/&gt; For example, if the pilot uses the rearward [[side-stick]] to [[Roll, pitch, and yaw|pitch]] the aircraft nose up, the control computers creating the flight envelope protection will prevent the pilot pitching the aircraft beyond the [[Stall (flight)|stalling]] [[angle of attack]]. As a result, even if the pilot tried to apply more and more if rearward control, the flight envelope protection would cause the aircraft to ignore this command.&lt;ref name="North"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Waldrop"/&gt; Flight envelope protection can in this way increase aircraft safety by allowing the pilot to apply in an emergency maximum control forces while not at the same time inadvertently putting the aircraft outside the margins of its operational safety.

Examples of where this might stop [[Aviation accidents and incidents|air accidents]] are when it allows a pilot to make a quick evasive maneuver in response to a [[ground proximity warning system]] warning, or in quick response to an approaching aircraft and a potential [[mid air collision]].&lt;ref name="North"/&gt; In this case without a flight envelope protection system, "you would probably hold back from maneuvering as hard as you could for fear of tumbling out of control, or worse. You would have to sneak up on it [2.5 G, the design limit], and when you got there you wouldn't be able to tell, because very few commercial pilots have ever flown 2.5 G. But in the [[Airbus A320 family|A320]], you wouldn't have to hesitate: you could just slam the controller all the way to the side and instantly get out of there as fast as the plane will take you."&lt;ref name="Waldrop"/&gt; Thus the makers of the Airbus argue: "envelope protection doesn't constrain the pilot. It liberates the pilot from uncertainty-and thus enhances safety."&lt;ref name="Waldrop"/&gt;

== Airbus and Boeing==
The [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]] was the first commercial aircraft to incorporate full flight-envelope protection into its flight-control software. This was instigated by former Airbus senior vice president for engineering [[Bernard Ziegler]].  In the Airbus, the flight envelope protection cannot be overridden completely, although the crew can fly beyond flight envelope limits by selecting an alternate "control law".&lt;ref name="North"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Traverse P.

==Incidents==

===China Airlines Flight 006===
{{further|China Airlines Flight 006}}
One objection raised against flight envelope protection is the incident that happened to China Airlines Flight 006, a [[Boeing 747SP|Boeing 747SP-09]], northwest of San Francisco in 1985.&lt;ref name="Waldrop"/&gt; In this flight incident, the crew was forced to overstress (and structurally damage) the horizontal tail surfaces in order to recover from a [[Aerobatic maneuver|roll]] and near-vertical dive. (This had been caused by an automatic disconnect of the [[autopilot]] and incorrect handling of a yaw brought about by an engine flame-out).  The pilot recovered control with about 10,000&amp;nbsp;ft of altitude remaining (from its original high-altitude cruise). But to do that the pilot had to pull the aircraft with an estimated 5.5 G, or more than twice its design limits.&lt;ref name="Waldrop"/&gt; If the aircraft had a flight envelope protection system, this recovery could not have been performed. Against this objection, Airbus has responded that an A320 in the situation of Flight 006 "never would have fallen out of the air
in the first place: the envelope protection would have automatically kept it in level flight in spite of the drag of a stalled engine".&lt;ref name="Waldrop"/&gt;

===FedEx Flight 705===
{{further|FedEx Flight 705}}
FedEx Flight 705, a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]]-30, was a case of a [[FedEx]] Flight Engineer who, facing a dismissal, attempted to hijack the plane and crash it into FedEx Headquarters in order for his family to collect his life insurance policy.  After being attacked and severely injured, the flight crew was able to fight back and land the plane safely. In order to keep the attacker off balance and out of the cockpit the crew had to perform extreme maneuvers, including a [[barrel roll]] and a dive so fast the airplane couldn't measure its speed. Had the crew not been able to exceed the plane's flight envelope, the crew might not have been successful {{citation needed|date=August 2016}}.

===American Airlines Flight 587===
{{further|American Airlines Flight 587}}
American Airlines Flight 587, an [[Airbus A300]], crashed when the vertical stabiliser broke off due to large rudder inputs by the pilot. A flight-envelope protection system could have prevented this crash, though it can still be argued that an override button should be provided for contingencies when the pilots are aware of the need to exceed normal limits.

===US Airways Flight 1549===
{{further|US Airways Flight 1549}}
US Airways Flight 1549, an [[Airbus A320]], experienced a dual engine failure after a bird strike and subsequently landed safely in the Hudson River. The NTSB accident report&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR1003.pdf in particular section 1.6.3 and 2.7.2&lt;/ref&gt; mentions the effect of flight envelope protection: ''"The airplane’s airspeed in the last 150 feet of the descent was low enough to activate the alpha-protection mode of the airplane’s fly-by-wire envelope protection features... Because of these features, the airplane could not reach the maximum AOA attainable in pitch normal law for the airplane weight and configuration; however, the airplane did provide maximum performance for the weight and configuration at that time... The flight envelope protections allowed the captain to pull full aft on the sidestick without the risk of stalling the airplane."''

===Air France Flight 447===
{{further|Air France Flight 447}}
Air France Flight 447, an [[Airbus A330]], entered an aerodynamic stall from which it did not recover and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean killing all aboard.
Temporary inconsistency between measured speeds, likely a result of the obstruction of the pitot tubes by ice crystals, caused autopilot disconnection and reconfiguration to alternate law; 
A second consequence of the reconfiguration into alternate law was that stall protection no longer operated. The crew made inappropriate control inputs that caused the aircraft to stall and did not recognize that the aircraft had stalled.

'''Gate checking''' refers to the practice that allows passengers check in their bags directly at the gate. Gate checking is mostly used on small planes when there isn’t enough space to take on board the cabin bags of all passengers.

Some companies offer different incentives for passengers who volunteer to check their bags at the gate instead of taking them on board. [[Virgin America]] offered free early boarding to its passengers who offer to gate check their carry-ons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nicandrob.com/2013/08/what-is-gate-checking-a-bag/|title= What is gate checking a bag?|publisher=[[nicandrob.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Airline Policies]] do not allow [[strollers]] on board. Passengers travelling with young [[children]] can check in their strollers at the gate, free of charge. For each child, airlines allow passengers to check in a stroller and a car seat. Most companies recommend small umbrella-type strollers that fold and many of them have size and weight limits. Almost all airlines return the strollers to the [[jet bridge]] upon arriving at destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wheretraveler.com/are-strollers-allowed-planes|title= Are Strollers Allowed on Planes? |publisher=[[wheretraveler.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companies, such as [[United Airlines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/travel/specialneeds/infants/default.aspx |title= Traveling With Children  |publisher=[[United Airlines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jet Blue]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://help.jetblue.com/SRVS/CGI-BIN/webisapi.dll?New,Kb=askBlue,case=obj(373795) |title= Baggage Allowance For a Lap Infant |publisher=[[Jet Blue]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Southwest Airlines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.southwest.com/html/customer-service/baggage/carryon-bags-pol.html|title=  Carryon Baggage |publisher=[[Southwest Airlines ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  assume no liability for any damage produced to gate-checked strollers. For this reason, it is recommended that passengers use [[Gate Check Bags]] for strollers and car seats.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10249">The '''Global Harmonization Task Force''' ('''GHTF''') was “a voluntary group of representatives from national [[medical device]] [[regulatory]] authorities (such as the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)) and the members of the [[medical device]] [[industry]]”&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;[http://www.ghtf.org/information/information.htm GHTF General Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027070242/http://www.ghtf.org/information/information.htm |date=2006-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whose goal was the standardization of medical device regulation across the world. The representatives from its five founding members (the [[European Union]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]] and [[Australia]]) were divided into three geographical areas: [[Europe]], [[Asia-Pacific]] and [[North America]], each of which actively regulates medical devices using their own unique regulatory framework. Founded in 1992, the GHTF was created in “an effort to respond to the growing need for international harmonization in the regulation of [[medical device]]s."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghtf.org/index.html GHTF Homepage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006200045/http://www.ghtf.org/index.html |date=2006-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GHTF  disbanded late in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raps.org/focus-online/news/news-article-view/article/2586/ghtf-says-final-goodbyes-shutters-website.aspx GHTF Says Final Goodbyes, Shutters Website]&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission has been taken over by the [[International Medical Device Regulators Forum]] (IMDRF), a successor organization composed of officials from regulatory agencies— not industry — around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdrf.org IMDRF website]&lt;/ref&gt; The GHTF website is no longer operational.

==Mission statement==

As quoted from the GHTF site now (IMDRF), “The purpose of the GHTF is to encourage the convergence in regulatory practices related to ensuring the safety, effectiveness/performance and quality of medical devices, promoting technological innovation and facilitating international trade, and the primary way in which this is accomplished is via the publication and dissemination of harmonized guidance documents on basic regulatory practices. These documents, which are developed by four different GHTF Study Groups, can then be adopted/implemented by member national regulatory authorities.

The GHTF also serves as an information exchange forum through which countries with medical device regulatory systems under development can benefit from the experience of those with existing systems and/or pattern their practices upon those of GHTF Founding Members.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghtf.org/information/information.htm GHTF Summary Statement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027070242/http://www.ghtf.org/information/information.htm |date=2006-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stated succinctly, the organization aims to standardize medical device regulations around the world by exchange of information.

==Membership==

===Founding members===
The founding members consist of regulatory authorities or industry members from the EU, the United States, Japan, Australia and Canada because of their well established and high standards in medical device regulations. Members also participate in the steering committee, which can recommend the inclusion of other participants in Study Groups to be a part of all GHTF activities.&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;[http://www.ghtf.org/information/guiding.pdf GHTF Guidelines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017220449/http://ghtf.org/information/guiding.pdf |date=2006-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Participating members===
Participating members consist of representatives from regulatory agencies or medical device trade associations not a part of the founding members. Participating members are to facilitate the adoption of as much of the GHTF’s policies in their region/agency as possible within legal parameters. Participating members can also take part in Study Groups as well as other expert working groups.&lt;ref name="guide" /&gt;

===Liaison bodies===
Liaison bodies are public health organizations, international standard-setting bodies or other groups who can contribute to or benefit from participation in GHTF. Liaison Bodies are encouraged to promote GHTF guidelines to their members and incorporate them into their work. Liaison bodies are permitted to nominate observers for GHTF Study Groups and other expert working groups.&lt;ref name="guide" /&gt;

===Observers===
Observers must be nominated by members and approved by the Study Group Chair. The level of participation that an Observer is granted is also decided by the Study Group Chair.&lt;ref name="guide" /&gt;

==Operating structure==

===Steering committee===

The purpose of the Steering Committee is to provide policy and direction for the GHTF. It is responsible for the assignment and oversight of new work items, adopt and monitor GHTF guidance documents and the authorization and promotion of GHTF training events.

The Steering Committee members consist of up to 8 members from each of the Founding Members’ regions. Of the 8 members, up to 4 may be from the regulatory sectors and up to 4 from the industry sectors. The Chain and Vice Chair members of the controlling region are not to be included in this number.&lt;ref name="steer"&gt;[http://www.ghtf.org/steering/steering.htm GHTF Steering Committee] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027070342/http://www.ghtf.org/steering/steering.htm |date=2006-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Study groups===

There are five study groups in the GHTF, each with a different focus. The size of each Study Group is to be determined by the Study Group Chair. Recommended members include one participant from each region with founding member status as well as appropriate numbers from [[regulatory authority|regulatory agencies]] and industry technical experts.

====Study Group 1====
Study Group 1 is concerned with the current medical device regulatory systems. From examining the current field, the group isolates the principles suitable for harmonization as well as those that pose a threat to harmonization. The Group also deals with the standardization of pre-market submissions and product labeling.

Examples of documents put out by Study Group 1 include [https://web.archive.org/web/20061027070815/http://www.ghtf.org/sg1/inventorysg1/SG1-N15-2006-Classification-FINAL.pdf Principles of Medical Devices Classification], and [https://web.archive.org/web/20061027070658/http://www.ghtf.org/sg1/inventorysg1/sg1final-n43.pdf Labeling for Medical Devices].

====Study Group 2====
Study Group 2 is concerned with medical device vigilance such as medical device reporting and post market surveillance. The Group is designed to harmonize the data collection and reporting systems of the industry.

Study Group 5 has yet to produce any final documents, but areas of proposed topics include [https://web.archive.org/web/20061006200459/http://www.ghtf.org/sg5/inventorysg5/SG5_PD_N2R7.pdf Clinical Evaluation] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20061006200521/http://www.ghtf.org/sg5/inventorysg5/SG5_PD_N1R7.pdf Clinical Evidence].

===Study Group Chair===

The Study Group Chair member is appointed for a three-year term by the Steering Committee. Upon completion of the term, the Chair is re-evaluated by the Steering Committee based on the needs of the Study Group. The support of a Vice Chair member usually consists of a member from the industry in a different region from the Chair.

=== Gogoro Smartscooter===

The [[Gogoro Smartscooter]] is an [[electric scooter]] designed for urban transportation. It's powered by an electric motor developed by Gogoro, which is marketed as the G1 Aluminum Liquid Cooled Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Byron|title=Gogoro Smartscooter First Look|url=http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/937/20748/Motorcycle-Article/Gogoro-Smartscooter-First-Look.aspx|website=Motorcycle USA|publisher=Motorcycle USA|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of plugging into an outlet to recharge, the Smartscooter runs on swappable [[Panasonic]] [[lithium ion]] 18650 batteries.&lt;ref name="Gogoro Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gogoro® Ignites Smart City Transformation with Launch of World’s First Smartscooter™ and Battery Swapping Infrastructure|url=http://www.gogoro.com/press/releases/2015-01-05-Gogoro-Smartscooter-launch/|website=Gogoro.com|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company states the following figures for the Smartscooter based on internal testing:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smartscooter Spec Sheet|url=http://images.gogoroapp.com/download/PDF/gogoro-smartscooter-spec-sheet-metric-unit.pdf|website=www.gogoro.com|publisher=Gogoro Inc.|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Top speed of 95&amp;nbsp;km/h
* Acceleration of 0 to 50&amp;nbsp;km/h in 4.2 seconds
* Maximum torque of 25 Nm @ 0-2,250 rpm
* Maximum horsepower of 8.3&amp;nbsp;hp @ 4,000 rpm
* Range of &gt;100&amp;nbsp;km when traveling at speeds of 40&amp;nbsp;km/h.

The Smartscooter's sensors collect information such as speed, battery level, consumption rate, system failures, and scooter falls. This information is presented to riders via Gogoro mobile apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nuñez|first1=Michael|title=CES 2015: The Gogoro Smartscooter Is A Tesla On Two Wheels|url=http://www.popsci.com/ces-2015-gogoro-smartscooter-tesla-two-wheels|website=Popular Science|publisher=Popular Science|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gogoro Energy Network===

The [[Gogoro Energy Network]] is a [[modular]] [[battery swapping]] infrastructure designed to be deployed across an urban region.

}}[[Tornadoes]], [[cyclones]], and other storms with strong winds damage or destroy many buildings. However, with proper design and construction, the damage to buildings by these forces can be greatly reduced. A variety of methods can help a building survive strong winds and storm surge.

==Storm surge considerations==

Waves along coastal areas can destroy many buildings. Buildings should preferably be built on high ground in order to avoid waves. If waves can reach the building site, the building ought to be elevated on steel, concrete, or wooden pilings or anchored to solid rock.

==Wind loading considerations==

===The foundation===

[[File:Pensacola Beach, Florida after Hurricane Dennis in 2005.jpg|right|thumb|A [[monolithic dome]] in [[Pensacola Beach, Florida#Novelty houses|Pensacola Beach, Florida]], after [[Hurricane Dennis]] in 2005]]
Wind acting on the roof surfaces of a building can cause negative pressures that create a lifting force sufficient  to lift the roof off the building. Once this occurs, the building is weakened considerably and the rest of the building will likely fail as well. To minimize this vulnerability, the upper structure ought to be anchored through the walls to the foundation.

Several methods can be used to anchor the roof. Typically, roof trusses are "toenailed" into the top of the walls, which provide insufficient force to resist high winds. [[Hurricane tie]]s nail into the wall and wrap over the trusses provide higher force resistance.

====Mobile home tie down to the foundation====
Interlocking metal pan roof systems installed on mobile homes can fail under the pressure differential (lift) created by the high velocity winds passing over the surface plane of the roof. This is compounded by the wind entering the building allowing the building interior to pressurize lifting the underside of the roof panels, resulting in destruction of the building.  One example of pan roof systems can be found in this document from [http://www.structall.com/pdf/guides/RoofOverGuide.pdf Structall Building Systems].

To mitigate this pressure differential, pre-installed aluminum tabular channels can permanently be fastened perpendicularly across the top of the interlocking ribs of the metal roof system without disturbing the flow of rainwater at the eaves, mid-span, and ridge locations of the building.

===Earth-sheltering===
[[Earth sheltering|Earth-sheltered]] construction is generally more resistant to strong winds and tornadoes than standard construction. Cellars and other earth sheltered components of other buildings, can provide safe refuge during tornadoes.

===Dome homes===
{{Main|Geodesic dome|Monolithic dome}}
The physical geometry of a building affects its aerodynamic properties and how well it can withstand a storm. Geodesic dome roofs or buildings have low drag coefficients and can withstand higher wind forces than a square building of the same area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanford.edu/~scheulen/.../StructuralMechanicsFinalReport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ewb-uk.org/system/files/Marek+Kubik+report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Even stronger buildings result from [[monolithic dome]] construction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.monolithic.com/stories/building-survivability-the-strength-of-the-monolithic-dome&lt;/ref&gt;

===Log house===
{{Main|Log house}}
A CAT 5 hurricane-proof [[log house]] is resistant to the winds up to 245 mph. Wall logs in such construction have to be made of&lt;ref&gt;http://eccobauer.com/en/hurricane-proof-log-housef&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glued_laminated_timber&lt;/ref&gt; [[glued laminated timber]] and all other components of the house have to be hurricane-resistant.

==Building components==
Building openings such as garage doors and windows are often weak points susceptible to failure by wind pressure and blowing debris. Once failure occurs, wind pressure builds up inside the building resulting in the roof lifting off the building. [[Hurricane shutters]] can provide protection.

Doors can be blown into the house by wind, causing potential [[structural failure]] (see http://www.floridadisaster.org/hrg/content/openings/openings_index.asp#Hinged_Exterior_Doors).

Windows can be constructed with plastic panes, shatterproof glass, or glass with protective membranes. The panes are often more firmly attached than normal window panes, including using screws or bolts through the edges of larger panes. Tapcons are used to fasten windows with the concrete structure surrounding.

Wood has a relatively high degree of flexibility, which can be beneficial under certain building stresses.

[[Reinforced concrete]] is a strong, dense material that, if used in a building that is designed properly, can withstand the destructive power of very high winds, and high-speed debris.

==Regulation==
After [[Hurricane Andrew]] in 1992 caused $16 billion in insured damage, the state of [[Florida]] established new building standards and enforcement. The state increased performance criteria for wind-load provisions and adopted new wind provisions from the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]. One important addition included with the new code was the requirement of [[Toughened glass|missile-impact resisting glass]], which can withstand high velocity impact from wind-borne debris during a hurricane. Many houses built in South Florida since Hurricane Andrew are [[Concrete masonry unit|cinder block masonry]] construction reinforced with concrete pillars, [[Truss|hurricane-strapped roof trusses]], and codes requirements for [[adhesive]]s and types of roofing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2007/05/18/79827.htm|title=Fla.

[[File:Model XAE IFF.jpg|thumb|Model XAE IFF kit, the first radio recognition IFF system in the U.S.]]

'''Identification, friend or foe''' ('''IFF''') is an identification system designed for [[command and control]]. It enables military and civilian [[air traffic control]] interrogation systems to identify aircraft, vehicles or forces as friendly and to determine their bearing and range from the interrogator. IFF may be used by both military and civilian aircraft. IFF was first developed during the [[Second World War]], with the arrival of [[radar]], and several infamous [[friendly fire]] incidents.

Despite the name, IFF can only positively identify friendly targets, not hostile ones.&lt;ref name=positive_tellumat&gt;{{cite web|title=Combat Identification IFF Systems|url=http://www.tellumat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Combat-Identification.pdf|website=Tellumat|accessdate=13 July 2016}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=positive_lockheed_martin&gt;{{cite web |title=MEADS System Gains Full Certification for Identifying Friend or Foe Aircraft |url=http://www.lockheedmartin.ca/us/news/press-releases/2014/may/mfc-052114-mead-system-gains-full-certification-identifying-friendfoe-aircraft.html |publisher=Lockheed Martin |accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=positive_global_security&gt;{{cite web |title=Identification Friend or Foe |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/systems/iff.htm |website=Global Security |accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=positive_bae_systems&gt;{{cite web |title=Combat Identification (IFF)|url=http://www.baesystems.com/capability/BAES_034933/combat-identification-iff;baeSessionId=lUOsHFthnKZjrNiYOcZp8fOHzSYkBOBmgITLAyZ1n43O4vk89I0w!-1477725154?_afrLoop=1384411860922000&amp;_afrWindowMode=0&amp;_afrWindowId=null#!%40%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26_afrLoop%3D1384411860922000%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3Dy4fuh4igo_4 |publisher=BAE Systems|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an IFF interrogation receives no reply or an invalid reply, the object cannot be identified as friendly, but is not positively identified as foe (it may, for instance, be a friendly aircraft with an inoperative or malfunctioning transponder). There are in addition many reasons that friendly aircraft may not properly reply to IFF.

IFF is a tool within the broader military action of '''Combat Identification''' (CID), "the process of attaining an accurate characterization of detected objects in the operational environment sufficient to support an engagement decision."  The broadest characterization is that of friend, enemy, neutral, or unknown. CID not only can reduce [[friendly fire]] incidents, but also contributes to overall tactical decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Joint Publication (JP) 3-09, Joint Fire Support |url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_09.pdf |publisher=US DoD |accessdate=27 December 2013 |page=III-20 |date=30 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411125036/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_09.pdf |archive-date=2014-04-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

With the successful deployment of radar systems for [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defence]] during [[World War II]], combatants were immediately confronted with the difficulty of distinguishing friendly aircraft from hostile ones; by that time, aircraft were flown at high speed and altitude, making visual identification impossible, and the targets showed up as featureless blips on the radar screen.
This led to incidents such as the "[[Battle of Barking Creek]]", over Britain,&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Yeoman &amp; John Freeborn, ''Tiger Cub – The Story of John Freeborn DFC* A 74 Squadron Fighter Pilot In WWII'', Pen and Sword Aviation, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-84884-023-2}}, p45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cossey"&gt;Bob Cossey, ''A Tiger's Tale: The Story of Battle of Britain Fighter Ace Wg.

====Early concepts====

[[File:Chain home coverage.jpg|thumb|upright|Radar coverage of the [[Chain Home]] system by 1939]]
Already before the deployment of their [[Chain Home| Chain Home radar system]] (CH), the [[RAF]] had considered the problem of IFF. [[Robert Watson-Watt]] had filed patents on such systems in 1935 and 1936. By 1938, researchers at [[Bawdsey Manor]] began experiments with "reflectors" consisting of [[dipole antenna]]s tuned to resonate to the primary frequency of the CH radars. When a pulse from the CH transmitter hit the aircraft, the antennas would resonate for a short time, increasing the amount of energy returned to the CH receiver. The antenna was connected to a motorized switch that periodically shorted it out, preventing it from producing a signal. This caused the return on the CH set to periodically lengthen and shorten as the antenna was turned on and off. In practice, the system was found to be too unreliable to use; the return was highly dependent on the direction the aircraft was moving relative to the CH station, and often returned little or no additional signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.maritime.org/doc/radar/part2.htm |title=General IFF principles |date=1945 |publisher=United States Fleet |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It had been suspected this system would be of little use in practice. When that turned out to be the case, the RAF turned to an entirely different system that was also being planned. This consisted of a set of tracking stations using [[HF/DF]] [[radio direction finder]]s. Their aircraft radios were modified to send out a 1&amp;nbsp;kHz tone for 14 seconds every minute, allowing the stations ample time to measure the aircraft's bearing. Several such stations were assigned to each "sector" of the air defence system, and sent their measurements to a plotting station at sector headquarters, who used [[triangulation]] to determine the aircraft's location. Known as "[[pip-squeak]]", the system worked, but was labour-intensive and did not display its information directly to the radar operators. A system that worked directly with the radar was clearly desirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vectorsite.net/ttwiz_01.html#m5 |title=The British invention of radar |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====IFF Mark II====
{{Main|IFF Mark II}}
The first active IFF [[transponder]] (transmitter/responder) was the IFF Mark I which was used experimentally in 1939. This used a [[regenerative receiver]], which fed a small amount of the amplified output back into the input, strongly amplifying even small signals as long as they were of a single frequency (like Morse code, but unlike voice transmissions). They were turned to the signal from the CH radar (20–30&amp;nbsp;MHz), amplifying it so strongly that it was broadcast back out the aircraft's antenna. Since the signal was received at the same time as the original reflection of the CH signal, the result was a lengthened "blip" on the CH display which was easily identifiable. In testing, it was found that the unit would often overpower the radar or produce too little signal to be seen, and at the same time, new radars were being introduced using new frequencies.

Instead of putting Mark I into production, a new [[IFF Mark II]] was introduced in early 1940. Mark II had a series of separate tuners inside tuned to different radar bands that it stepped through using a motorized switch, while an [[automatic gain control]] solved the problem of it sending out too much signal. Mark II was technically complete as the war began, but a lack of sets meant it was not available in quantity and only a small number of RAF aircraft carried it by the time of the [[Battle of Britain]]. Pip-squeak was kept in operation during this period, but as the Battle ended, IFF Mark II was quickly put into full operation. Pip-squeak was still used for areas over land where CH did not cover, as well as an emergency guidance system.&lt;ref name=story&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lord Bowden |date=1985 |title=The story of IFF (identification friend or foe) |url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4647747&amp;sortType%3Dasc_p_Sequence%26filter%3DAND%28p_IS_Number%3A4647735%29 |journal=Physical Science, Measurement and Instrumentation, Management and Education - Reviews, IEE Proceedings A |volume=132 |issue=6 |accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====IFF Mark III====
{{Main|IFF Mark III}}
Even by 1940 the complex system of Mark II was reaching its limits while new radars were being constantly introduced. By 1941, a number of sub-models were introduced that covered different combinations of radars, common naval ones for instance, or those used by the RAF. But the introduction of radars based on the [[microwave]]-frequency [[cavity magnetron]] rendered this obsolete; there was simply no way to make a responder operating in this band using contemporary electronics.

In 1940, English engineer [[Frederic Calland Williams|Freddie Williams]] had suggested using a single separate frequency for all IFF signals, but at the time there seemed no pressing need to change the existing system. With the introduction of the magnetron, work on this concept began at the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] as the [[IFF Mark III]]. This was to become the standard for the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] for most of the war.

Mark III transponders were designed to respond to specific 'interrogators', rather than replying directly to received radar signals. These interrogators worked on a limited selection of frequencies, no matter what radar they were paired with. The system also allowed limited communication to be made, including the ability to transmit a coded '[[Mayday]]' response. The IFF sets were designed and built by [[Ferranti]] in [[Manchester]] to Williams' specifications. Equivalent sets were manufactured in the US, initially as copies of British sets, so that allied aircraft would be identified upon interrogation by each other's radar.&lt;ref name=story/&gt;

IFF sets were obviously highly classified. Thus, many of them were wired with explosives in the event the aircrew bailed out or crash landed. Jerry Proc reports: 

"Alongside the switch to turn on the unit was the IFF destruct switch to prevent its capture by the enemy. Many a pilot chose the wrong switch and blew up his IFF unit. The thud of a contained explosion and the acrid smell of burning insulation in the cockpit did not deter many pilots from destroying IFF units time and time again. Eventually, the self destruct switch was secured by a thin wire to prevent its accidental use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Proc |first1=Jerry |title=IFF System History |url=http://jproc.ca/sari/sariff.html |website=The Web Pages Of Jerry Proc |publisher=Jerry Proc |accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
[[File:Erstling-geber.jpg|thumb|left|Code generator from German WW II IFF-Radio [[Erstling IFF transceiver|FuG 25a]] ''Erstling'']]

[[Erstling IFF transceiver|FuG 25a ''Erstling'']] (English: Firstborn, Debut) was developed in Germany in 1940. It had two bands tuned to  the low-[[VHF]] band at 125&amp;nbsp;MHz used by the [[Freya radar]] and the low-[[UHF]]-banded 550–580&amp;nbsp;MHz used by [[Würzburg radar|Würzburg]]). Before flight, the transceiver was set up with a selected day code of ten [[bit]]s which was dialled into the unit. To start the identification procedure, the ground operator switched the pulse frequency of his radar from 3,750&amp;nbsp;Hz to 5,000&amp;nbsp;Hz. The airborne receiver decoded that and started to transmit the day code. The radar operator would then see the blip lengthen and shorten in the given code, ensuring it was not being spoofed. The IFF transmitter worked on 168&amp;nbsp;MHz with a power of 400 watts (PEP).

The system included a way for ground controllers to determine whether an aircraft had the right code or not but it did not include a way for the transponder to reject signals from other sources. [[UK|British]] military scientists found a way of exploiting this by building their own IFF transmitter called '''"Perfectos"''', which were designed to trigger a response from any FuG 25a system in the vicinity. When an FuG 25a responded on its 168&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency, the signal was received by the antenna system from an [[AI Mk. IV radar]], which originally operated at 212&amp;nbsp;MHz. By comparing the strength of the signal on different antennas the direction to the target could be determined. Mounted on [[De Havilland Mosquito|Mosquitos]], the "Perfectos" severely limited German use of the FuG 25a.

===Further wartime developments===
====IFF Mark IV and V====
The [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]] had been working on their own IFF system since before the war. It used a single interrogation frequency, like the Mark III and a separate responder frequency. Responding on a different frequency has several practical advantages but requires a transmitter for the responder side of the circuitry, in contrast to the greatly simplified system used in the British designs. This technique is now known as a '''cross-band transponder'''. When the Mark II was revealed in 1941 during the [[Tizard Mission]], it was decided to use it and take the time to further improve their experimental system. The result was what became the Mark IV. The main difference between this and earlier models is that it worked on higher frequencies, around 600&amp;nbsp;MHz, which allowed much smaller antennas. Unfortunately, this also turned out to be close to the frequencies used by the German [[Würzburg radar]] and there were concerns that it would be triggered by that radar and the transponder responses would be picked on its radar display and thereby give away the operational frequencies. This led to a US–British effort to make a further improved model, the Mark V, also known as the United Nations Beacon or UNB. This moved to still higher frequencies around 1&amp;nbsp;GHz but operational testing was not complete when the war ended. By the time testing was finished in 1948, the much improved Mark X was beginning its testing and Mark V was abandoned.

===Postwar systems===
====IFF Mark X====
Mark X started as a purely experimental device operating at frequencies above 1&amp;nbsp;GHz, but as development continued it was decided to introduce an encoding system known as the "Selective Identification Feature", or SIF. SIF allowed the return signal to contain up to 12 pulses, representing four [[octal]] digits of 3 bits each. Depending on the timing of the interrogation signal, SIF would respond in several ways. Mode 1 indicated the type of aircraft or its mission (cargo, for instance) while Mode 2 returned a tail code.

Mark X began to be introduced in the early 1950s. This was during a period of great expansion of the civilian air transport system, and it was decided to use slightly modified Mark X sets for these aircraft as well. These sets included a new Mode 3 which was paired with a civilian Mode A, which operated similar to the original Mode 2 and returned a four-digit identifier. Because Mode 3 and A are identical, they are normally referred to as Mode 3/A. Mode C returned the altitude encoded in a single 12-bit number in [[Gillham code]], which represented the altitude as (that number) x 100 feet - 1200. Mode B and D were specified but never used.

====IFF Mark XII====
The current IFF system is the Mark XII. This works on the same frequencies as Mark X, and supports all of its military and civilian modes.

The main reason for the creation of Mark XII was the addition of the military Mode 4. Before Mark XII, the transponders would respond to any properly formed interrogation signal, broadcasting a reply that could be picked up by any receiver. Using [[triangulation]], an enemy could determine the location of the transponder. The British had already used this during WWII, and it was used by the USAF against [[Vietnam People's Air Force|VPAF]] aircraft during the [[Vietnam War]].

Mode 4 started with an interrogation similar to Mode 3, but then followed that with an encoded pulse chain similar to the one used in Mode 3/A. The receiver side of the transponder checks this code against a known day code, and only responds if the two match. The pulses in the reply are delayed based on the received code. This largely eliminates the ability for the enemy to trigger the transponder.

During the 1980s, a new civilian mode, Mode S, was added that allowed greatly increased amounts of data to be encoded in the returned signal. This was used to encode the location of the aircraft from the navigation system. This is a basic part of the [[traffic collision avoidance system]] (TCAS) system that allows commercial aircraft to know the location of other aircraft in the area and avoid them without the need for ground operators.

The basic concepts from Mode S were then militarized as Mode 5, which is simply a [[Cryptography|cryptographically]] encoded version of the Mode S data.

The IFF of [[World War II]] and Soviet military systems (1946 to 1991) used coded [[radar]] signals (called Cross-Band  Interrogation, or CBI) to automatically trigger the aircraft's transponder in an aircraft illuminated by the radar. Radar-based aircraft identification is also called [[secondary radar]] in both military and civil usage, with primary radar bouncing an RF pulse off of the aircraft to determine position.  George Charrier, working for [[RCA]], filed for a [[patent]] for such an IFF device in 1941. It required the operator to perform several adjustments to the radar receiver to suppress the image of the natural echo on the radar receiver, so that visual examination of the IFF signal would be possible.&lt;ref&gt;George M. Charrier, Recognition System for Pulse Echo Radio Locators, {{US patent|2453970}}, granted Nov. 16, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1943, Donald Barchok filed a patent for a radar system using the acronym IFF in his text with only parenthetic explanation, indicating that this acronym had become an accepted term.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Barchok, Means for Synchronizing Detection and Interrogation Systems, {{US patent|2515178}}, granted July 18, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1945, Emile Labin and Edwin Turner filed patents for radar IFF systems where the outgoing radar signal and the transponder's reply signal could each be independently programmed with a binary codes by setting arrays of toggle switches; this allowed the IFF code to be varied from day to day or even hour to hour.&lt;ref&gt;Emile Labin, Magnetostrictive Time-Delay Device, {{US patent|2495740}}, granted Jan. 31, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwin E. Turner, Coded Impulse Responsive Secret Signalling System, {{US patent|2648060}}, granted Aug. 4, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 21st century systems==

===NATO===
The United States and other NATO countries started using a system called Mark XII in the late twentieth century; Britain had not until then implemented an IFF system compatible with that standard, but then developed a program for a compatible system known as successor IFF (SIFF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2002/October/Pages/Nations_Seek4006.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-12-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408224218/http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2002/October/Pages/Nations_Seek4006.aspx |archive-date=2014-04-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''image scanner'''—often abbreviated to just '''scanner''', although the term is ambiguous out of context ([[Barcode reader|barcode scanner]], [[CT scan|CT scanner]] etc.)—is a device that optically scans images, printed text, [[handwriting]] or an object and converts it to a [[digital image]]. Commonly used in offices are variations of the desktop ''flatbed scanner'' where the document is placed on a glass window for scanning. ''Hand-held scanners'', where the device is moved by hand, have evolved from text scanning "wands" to [[3D scanner]]s used for industrial design, reverse engineering, test and measurement, [[orthotics]], gaming and other applications. Mechanically driven scanners that move the document are typically used for large-format documents, where a flatbed design would be impractical.

Modern scanners typically use a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) or a [[contact image sensor]] (CIS) as the image sensor, whereas ''drum scanners'', developed earlier and still used for the highest possible image quality, use a [[photomultiplier]] tube (PMT) as the image sensor. A ''rotary scanner,'' used for high-speed document scanning, is a type of drum scanner that uses a CCD array instead of a photomultiplier. Non-contact [[planetary scanner]]s essentially photograph delicate books and documents. All these scanners produce two-dimensional images of subjects that are usually flat, but sometimes solid; 3D scanners produce information on the three-dimensional structure of solid objects.

[[Digital camera]]s can be used for the same purposes as dedicated scanners. When compared to a true scanner, a camera image is subject to a degree of distortion, reflections, shadows, low contrast, and blur due to camera shake (reduced in cameras with [[image stabilization]]). Resolution is sufficient for less demanding applications. Digital cameras offer advantages of speed, portability and non-contact digitizing of thick documents without damaging the book spine. {{As of|2010}} scanning technologies were combining 3D scanners with digital cameras to create full-color, photo-realistic 3D models of objects.&lt;ref&gt;Meierhold, N., Spehr, M., Schilling, A., Gumhold, S. and Maas, H.G. (2010). Automatic feature matching between digital images and 2D representations of a 3D laser scanner point cloud, Proceedings of the ISPRS Commission V Mid-Term Symposium Close Range Image Measurement Techniques, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, 2010, pp. 446–451.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the biomedical research area, detection devices for [[DNA microarray|DNA microarrays]] are called scanners as well. These scanners are high-resolution systems (up to 1&amp;nbsp;µm/ pixel), similar to microscopes. The detection is done via CCD or a photomultiplier tube.

Modern scanners are considered the successors of early [[Wirephoto|telephotography]] and [[fax]] input devices.

The '''pantelegraph''' (Italian: ''pantelegrafo''; French: '''pantélégraphe''') was an early form of [[Fax|facsimile machine]] transmitting over normal telegraph lines developed by [[Giovanni Caselli]], used commercially in the 1860s, that was the first such device to enter practical service. It used electromagnets to drive and synchronize movement of pendulums at the source and the distant location, to scan and reproduce images. It could transmit handwriting, signatures, or drawings within an area of up to 150 × 100 mm.

[[Édouard Belin]]'s [[Wirephoto|Belinograph]] of 1913, scanned using a [[Photodetector|photocell]] and transmitted over ordinary phone lines, formed the basis for the AT&amp;T Wirephoto service. In Europe, services similar to a wirephoto were called a '''Belino'''. It was used by news agencies from the 1920s to the mid-1990s, and consisted of a rotating drum with a single photodetector at a standard speed of 60 or 120 rpm (later models up to 240 rpm). They send a linear analog [[Amplitude modulation|AM signal]] through standard telephone voice lines to receptors, which synchronously print the proportional intensity on special paper. Color photos were sent as three separated [[RGB color model|RGB]] filtered images consecutively, but only for special events due to transmission costs.

'''Drum scanners''' capture image information with [[photomultiplier|photomultiplier tubes]] (PMT), rather than the [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) arrays found in flatbed scanners and inexpensive [[film scanner]]s. "Reflective and transmissive originals are mounted on an acrylic cylinder, the scanner drum, which rotates at high speed while it passes the object being scanned in front of precision optics that deliver image information to the PMTs. Modern color drum scanners use three matched PMTs, which read red, blue, and green light, respectively. Light from the original artwork is split into separate red, blue, and green beams in the optical bench of the scanner with dichroic filters."&lt;ref name="Pushkar1"&gt;Pushkar O.I., (2011), Information systems and technologies. Summary of lectures. /O.I. Pushkar, K.S. Sibilyev. – Kharkiv: Publishing House of KhNUE, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; Photomultipliers offer superior dynamic range and for this reason drum scanners can extract more detail from very dark shadow areas of a transparency than flatbed scanners using CCD sensors. The smaller dynamic range of the CCD sensors, versus photomultiplier tubes, can lead to loss of shadow detail, especially when scanning very dense transparency film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dl-c.com/Temp/downloads/Whitepapers/Scan.pdf |title=Scanners and how to use them |author=Sachs, J. |publisher=Digital Light &amp; Color |date=2001-02-01 |accessdate=2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; While mechanics vary by manufacturer, most drum scanners pass light from [[Halogen lamp|halogen lamps]] though a focusing system to illuminate both reflective and transmissive originals.

The drum scanner gets its name from the clear acrylic cylinder, the drum, on which the original artwork is mounted for scanning. Depending on size, it is possible to mount originals up to {{convert|20|×|28|in}}, but maximum size varies by manufacturer. "One of the unique features of drum scanners is the ability to control sample area and aperture size independently. The sample size is the area that the scanner encoder reads to create an individual pixel. The aperture is the actual opening that allows light into the optical bench of the scanner. The ability to control aperture and sample size separately is particularly useful for smoothing film grain when scanning black-and-white and color negative originals."&lt;ref name="Pushkar1"/&gt;

While drum scanners are capable of scanning both reflective and transmissive artwork, a good-quality flatbed scanner can produce good scans from reflective artwork. As a result, drum scanners are rarely used to scan prints now that high-quality, inexpensive flatbed scanners are readily available. Film, however, is where drum scanners continue to be the tool of choice for high-end applications. Because film can be wet-mounted to the scanner drum, which enhances sharpness and masks dust and scratches, and because of the exceptional sensitivity of the PMTs, drum scanners are capable of capturing very subtle details in film originals.

The situation {{As of|2014|lc=on}} was that only a few companies continued to manufacture and service drum scanners. While prices of both new and used units dropped from the start of the 21st century, they were still much more costly than CCD flatbed and film scanners. Image quality produced by flatbed scanners had improved to the degree that the best ones were suitable for many graphic-arts operations, and they replaced drum scanners in many cases as they were less expensive and faster. However, drum scanners with their superior resolution (up to 24,000 [[Pixel density|PPI]]), color gradation, and value structure continued to be used for scanning images to be enlarged, and for museum-quality archiving of photographs and print production of high-quality books and magazine advertisements. As second-hand drum scanners became more plentiful and less costly, many fine-art photographers acquired them.

===Flatbed===&lt;!-- [[Flatbed scanner]] redirects here --&gt;

This type of scanner is sometimes called a reflective scanner because it works by shining white light onto the object to be scanned and reading the intensity and color of light that is reflected from it, usually a line at a time. They are designed for scanning prints or other flat, opaque materials but some have available transparency adapters, which for a number of reasons, in most cases, are not very well suited to scanning film.&lt;ref name="basics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dl-c.com/basics.pdf |title=Digital Image Basics |author=Sachs, J. |publisher=Digital Light &amp; Color |date=2001-02-01 |accessdate=2015-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120202325/http://www.dl-c.com/basics.pdf |archivedate=2015-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====CCD scanner====
"A flatbed scanner is usually composed of a glass pane (or [[platen]]), under which there is a bright light (often [[xenon]], [[Light-emitting diode#Other applications|LED]] or [[Cold cathode|cold cathode fluorescent]]) which illuminates the pane, and a moving optical array in [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] scanning. CCD-type scanners typically contain three rows (arrays) of sensors with red, green, and blue filters."&lt;ref name="Pushkar2"&gt;Pushkar O.I., (2011), Information systems and technologies.

====CIS scanner====
[[File:Overwiew - Scanner unit CIS Canon MP500 5of5.jpg|thumb|Scanner unit with CIS. A: assembled, B: disassembled; 1: housing, 2: light conductor, 3: lenses, 4: chip with two RGB-LEDs, 5: CIS]]
[[Contact image sensor|Contact image sensor (CIS)]] scanning consists of a moving set of red, green and blue [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]s strobed for illumination and a connected monochromatic [[photodiode]] array under a rod lens array for light collection. "Images to be scanned are placed face down on the glass, an opaque cover is lowered over it to exclude ambient light, and the sensor array and light source move across the pane, reading the entire area. An image is therefore visible to the detector only because of the light it reflects. Transparent images do not work in this way, and require special accessories that illuminate them from the upper side. Many scanners offer this as an option."&lt;ref name="Pushkar2"/&gt;

===Film===
{{main article|Film scanner}}
[[File:Coolscan-V.jpg|thumb|DSLR camera and slide scanner]]
This type of scanner is sometimes called a slide or transparency scanner and it works by passing a narrowly focused beam of light through the film and reading the intensity and color of the light that emerges.&lt;ref name="basics"/&gt; "Usually, uncut film strips of up to six frames, or four mounted slides, are inserted in a carrier, which is moved by a [[stepper motor]] across a lens and CCD sensor inside the scanner. Some models are mainly used for same-size scans. Film scanners vary a great deal in price and quality."&lt;ref name="Dubey"&gt;Dubey, N.B. (2009), Office Management: Developing Skills for Smooth Functioning, Global India Publications, 312 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest-cost dedicated film scanners can be had for less than $50 and they might be sufficient for modest needs. From there they inch up in staggered levels of quality and advanced features upward of five figures. "The specifics vary by brand and model and the end results are greatly determined by the level of sophistication of the scanner's optical system and, equally important, the sophistication of the scanning software."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/buying-guide/film-scanners |title=Film Scanners: A Buying Guide |author=Weitz, A. |publisher=Explora - B&amp;H Photo Video |date=2015-11-06 |accessdate=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roller scanner===
Scanners are available that pull a flat sheet over the scanning element between rotating rollers. They can only handle single sheets up to a specified width (typically about 210&amp;nbsp;mm, the width of many printed letters and documents), but can be very compact, just requiring a pair of narrow rollers between which the document is passed. Some are [[Image scanner#Portable|portable]], powered by batteries and with their own storage, eventually transferring stored scans to a computer over a [[USB]] or other interface.

===3D scanner===
{{Main article|3D scanner}}
3D scanners collect data on the [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] shape and appearance of an object.

===Planetary scanner===
{{Main article|Planetary scanner}}
Planetary scanners scan a delicate object without physical contact.

===Hand===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2011}}
[[File:GeniScan GS4500 Hand Scanner (top).jpg|left|thumb|GeniScan GS4500 hand scanner]]
Hand scanners are moved over the subject to be imaged by hand. There are two different types: document and 3D scanners.

====Hand document scanner====
Hand-held document scanners are manual devices that are dragged across the surface of the image to be scanned by hand. Scanning documents in this manner requires a steady hand, as an uneven scanning rate produces distorted images; an indicator light on the scanner indicates if motion is too fast. They typically have a "start" button, which is held by the user for the duration of the scan; some switches to set the [[optical resolution]]; and a roller, which generates a clock pulse for synchronization with the computer. Older hand scanners were [[monochrome]], and produced light from an array of green [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]s to illuminate the image";&lt;ref name="Dubey"/&gt; later ones scan in monochrome or color, as desired. A hand scanner may have a small window through which the document being scanned could be viewed. In the early 1990s many hand scanners had a proprietary interface module specific to a particular type of computer, such as an [[Atari ST]] or Commodore [[Amiga]]. Since the introduction of the USB standard, it is the interface most commonly used. As hand scanners are much narrower than most normal document or book sizes, software (or the end user) needed to combine several narrow "strips" of scanned document to produce the finished article.

Inexpensive [[Image scanner#Portable|portable]] battery-powered "glide-over" hand scanners, typically capable of scanning an area as wide as a normal letter and much longer remain available {{As of|2014|lc=on}}.

====Hand 3D scanner====
Handheld 3D scanners are used in industrial design, reverse engineering, inspection and analysis, digital manufacturing and medical applications. "To compensate for the uneven motion of the human hand, most 3D scanning systems rely on the placement of reference markers, typically adhesive reflective tabs that the scanner uses to align elements and mark positions in space."&lt;ref name="Dubey"/&gt;

===Portable===
Image scanners are usually used in conjunction with a [[computer]] which controls the scanner and stores scans. Small portable scanners, either [[Image scanner#Portable|roller-fed]] or "glide-over" [[Image scanner#Portable|hand]]-operated, operated by batteries and with storage capability, are available for use away from a computer; stored scans can be transferred later. Many can scan both small documents such as business cards and till receipts, and letter-sized documents.

===Smartphone scanner apps===
The higher-resolution cameras fitted to some smartphones can produce reasonable quality document scans by taking a photograph with the phone's camera and post-processing it with a scanning app, a range of which are available for most phone [[operating system]]s, to whiten the background of a page, correct perspective distortion so that the shape of a rectangular document is corrected, convert to black-and-white, etc. Many such apps can scan multiple-page documents with successive camera exposures and output them either as a single file or multiple page files. Some smartphone scanning apps can save documents directly to online storage locations, such as [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]] and [[Evernote]], send via email or fax documents via email-to-fax gateways.

Smartphone scanner apps can be broadly divided into three categories:
# Document scanning apps primarily designed to handle documents and output PDF, and sometimes JPEG, files
# Photo scanning apps that output JPEG files, and have editing functions useful for photo rather than document editing;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pic-scanner-batch-scan-old/id644278663?mt=8|title=Pic Scanner: Scan photos and albums on the App Store|website=App Store|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Barcode-like [[QR code]] scanning apps that then search the internet for information associated with the code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/425907/scan-anything-and-let-your-phone-do-the-rest/|title=Scan Anything and Let Your Phone Do the Rest|work=MIT Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scan quality ==
[[File:Image Scanner.JPG|thumb|A flatbed scanner. Documents or images are placed face-down beneath the cover (shown closed here).]]

Color scanners typically read RGB ([[RGB color model|red-green-blue color]]) data from the array. This data is then processed with some proprietary algorithm to correct for different exposure conditions, and sent to the computer via the device's [[input/output]] interface (usually [[USB]], previous to which was [[SCSI]] or bidirectional [[parallel port]] in older units).

'''[[Color depth]]''' varies depending on the scanning array characteristics, but is usually at least 24 bits. High quality models have 36-48 bits of color depth.

Another qualifying parameter for a scanner is its ''[[Image resolution|resolution]]'', measured in [[Pixel density|pixels per inch]] (ppi), sometimes more accurately referred to as [[Samples per inch]] (spi). Instead of using the scanner's true '''optical resolution''', the only meaningful parameter, manufacturers like to refer to the ''interpolated resolution'', which is much higher thanks to software [[interpolation]]. {{As of|2009}}, a high-end flatbed scanner can scan up to 5400 ppi and drum scanners have an optical resolution of between 3,000 and 24,000 ppi.

"Effective resolution" is the true resolution of a scanner, and is determined by using a resolution test chart.  The effective resolution of most all consumer flatbed scanners is considerably lower than the manufactures' given optical resolution.  Example is the Epson V750 Pro with an optical resolution given by manufacturer as being 4800dpi and 6400dpi (dual lens),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/jsp/Product.do?UseCookie=yes&amp;sku=B11B178061&amp;modeloid=66134&amp;infoType=Overview|title=Epson Perfection V750-M Pro Scanner|work=epson.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924001730/http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/jsp/Product.do?UseCookie=yes&amp;sku=B11B178061&amp;modeloid=66134&amp;infoType=Overview|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but tested "According to this we get a resolution of only about 2300 dpi - that's just 40% of the claimed resolution!"&lt;ref name="filmscanner.info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmscanner.info/en/EpsonPerfectionV750Pro.html|title=Test report film-flatbed-scanner Epson Perfection V750 Pro transparency unit: experiences report; image quality, scanning slides, medium formats|work=filmscanner.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dynamic range is claimed to be 4.0 Dmax, but "Regarding the density range of the Epson Perfection V750 Pro, which is indicated as 4.0, one must say that here it doesn't reach the high-quality [of] film scanners either."&lt;ref name="filmscanner.info"/&gt;

Manufacturers often claim interpolated resolutions as high as 19,200 ppi; but such numbers carry little meaningful value, because the number of possible [[digital zoom|interpolated pixels]] is unlimited and doing so does not increase the level of captured detail.

The size of the file created increases with the square of the resolution; doubling the resolution quadruples the file size. A resolution must be chosen that is within the capabilities of the equipment, preserves sufficient detail, and does not produce a file of excessive size. The file size can be reduced for a given resolution by using "lossy" compression methods such as [[JPEG]], at some cost in quality. If the best possible quality is required lossless compression should be used; reduced-quality files of smaller size can be produced from such an image when required (e.g., image designed to be printed on a full page, and a much smaller file to be displayed as part of a fast-loading web page).

Purity can be diminished by scanner noise, optical flare, poor analog to digital conversion, scratches, dust, [[Newton's rings]], out of focus sensors, improper scanner operation, and poor software. Drum scanners are said to produce the purest digital representations of the film, followed by high end film scanners that use the larger Kodak Tri-Linear sensors.

The third important parameter for a scanner is its '''density range''' (Dynamic Range) or Drange (see [[Densitometry]]). A high density range means that the scanner is able to record shadow details and brightness details in one scan. Density of film is measured on a base 10 log scale and varies between 0.0 (transparent) and 5.0, about 16 stops.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmscanner.info/en/Dichte.html|title=Density Range, Maximum Density, Image Quality Criterion Scanner Explanation, Signification Object Contrast Aperture Stop|work=filmscanner.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Density range is the space taken up in the 0 to 5 scale, and Dmin and Dmax denote where the least dense and most dense measurements on a negative or positive film. The density range of negative film is up to 3.6d,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; while slide film dynamic range is 2.4d.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Color negative density range after processing is 2.0d thanks to compression of the 12 stops into a small density range.  Dmax will be the densest on slide film for shadows, and densest on negative film for highlights.  Some slide films can have a Dmax close to 4.0d with proper exposure, and so can black-and-white negative film.

Consumer-level flatbed photo scanners have a dynamic range in the 2.0–3.0 range, which can be inadequate for scanning all types of [[photographic film]], as Dmax can be and often is between 3.0d and 4.0d with traditional black-and-white film. Color film compresses its 12 stops of a possible 16 stops (film latitude) into just 2.0d of space via the process of dye coupling and removal of all silver from the emulsion.  Kodak Vision 3 has 18 stops.  So, color negative film scans the easiest of all film types on the widest range of scanners. Because traditional black-and-white film retains the image creating silver after processing, density range can be almost twice that of color film.  This makes scanning traditional black-and-white film more difficult and requires a scanner with at least a 3.6d dynamic range, but also a Dmax between 4.0d to 5.0d. High-end (photo lab) flatbed scanners can reach a dynamic range of 3.7, and Dmax around 4.0d. Dedicated [[film scanner]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmscanner.info/FilmscannerRangliste.html|title=Filmscanner-Rangliste Diascanner-Vergleich: Scanner-Tests mit Leistungsdaten, Vorteile, Nachteile, Technischen Daten|work=filmscanner.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a dynamic range between 3.0d–4.0d.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Office document scanners can have a dynamic range of less than 2.0d.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Drum scanners have a dynamic range of 3.6–4.5.

By combining full-color imagery with 3D models, modern hand-held scanners are able to completely reproduce objects electronically. The addition of 3D color printers enables accurate miniaturization of these objects, with applications across many industries and professions.

For scanner apps, the scan quality is highly dependent on the quality of the phone camera and on the framing chosen by the user of the app.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://help.thegrizzlylabs.com/article/94-what-is-the-resolution-in-dpi-of-the-scans|title=What is the DPI of my scans? - The Grizzly Labs|last=Labs|first=The Grizzly|website=help.thegrizzlylabs.com|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer connection ==
[[File:Photoshop goddess version 1.05 (3378276180).jpg|thumb|A film picture being scanned into a computer at the photo desk of the ''[[The Detroit News|Detroit News]]'' in the early 1990s.]]
Scans must virtually always be transferred from the scanner to a computer or information storage system for further processing or storage. There are two basic issues: (1) how the scanner is physically connected to the computer and (2) how the application retrieves the information from the scanner.

=== Direct physical connection to a computer ===
The file size of a scan can be up to  about 100 [[megabyte]]s for a {{nowrap|600 [[Dots per inch|DPI]]}} {{nowrap|23 x 28 cm}} (9"x11") (slightly larger than [[ISO 216|A4 paper]]) uncompressed [[Color depth|24-bit]] image. Scanned files must be transferred and stored. Scanners can generate this volume of data in a matter of seconds, making a fast connection desirable.

Scanners communicate to their host computer using one of the following physical interfaces, listing roughly from slow to fast:
* '''[[Parallel port]]''' - Connecting through a parallel port is the slowest common transfer method. Early scanners had parallel port connections that could not transfer data faster than 70 [[kilobyte]]s/[[second]]. The primary advantage of the parallel port connection was economic and user skill level: it avoided adding an interface card to the computer.
* '''[[IEEE-488|GPIB]]''' - General Purpose Interface Bus. Certain drumscanners like the Howtek D4000 featured both a SCSI and GPIB interface. The latter conforms to the IEEE-488 standard, introduced in the mid 1970s. The GPIB interface has only been used by a few scanner manufacturers, mostly serving the DOS/Windows environment. For Apple Macintosh systems, National Instruments provided a [[NuBus]] GPIB interface card.
* '''[[SCSI|Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)]]''', rarely used since the early 21st century, supported only by computers with a SCSI interface, either on a card or built-in. During the evolution of the SCSI standard, speeds increased. Widely available and easily set up USB and Firewire largely supplanted SCSI.
* '''[[USB|Universal Serial Bus (USB)]]''' scanners can transfer data quickly. The early USB 1.1 standard could transfer data at 1.5 megabytes per second (slower than SCSI), but the later USB 2.0/3.0 standards can transfer at more than 20/60 megabytes per second in practice.
* '''[[IEEE 1394|FireWire]]''', or IEEE-1394, is an interface of comparable speed to USB 2.0. Possible FireWire speeds are 25, 50, and 100, 400 and 800 megabits per second, but devices may not support all speeds.
* '''[[Proprietary hardware|Proprietary]]''' interfaces were used on some early scanners that used a proprietary interface card rather than a standard interface.&lt;!--Mustek?--&gt;

=== Indirect (network) connection to a computer ===
During the early 1990s professional flatbed scanners were available over a [[Local area network|local computer network]]. This proved useful to publishers, print shops, etc. This functionality largely fell out of use as the cost of flatbed scanners reduced enough to make sharing unnecessary.

From 2000 all-in-one multi-purpose devices became available which were suitable for both small offices and consumers, with printing, scanning, copying, and fax capability in a single apparatus which can be made available to all members of a workgroup.

Battery-powered portable scanners store scans on internal memory; they can later be transferred to a computer either by direct connection, typically USB, or in some cases a memory card may be removed from the scanner and plugged into the computer.

=== Applications Programming Interface ===
A paint application such as [[GIMP]] or Adobe Photoshop must communicate with the scanner. There are many different scanners, and many of those scanners use different protocols. In order to simplify applications programming, some [[Applications programming interface]]s ("API") were developed. The API presents a uniform interface to the scanner. This means that the application does not need to know the specific details of the scanner in order to access it directly. For example, Adobe Photoshop supports the [[TWAIN]] standard; therefore in theory Photoshop can acquire an image from any scanner that has a TWAIN driver.&lt;!--GIMP + SANE?--&gt;

In practice, there are often problems with an application communicating with a scanner. Either the application or the scanner manufacturer (or both) may have faults in their implementation of the API.

Typically, the API is implemented as a [[Library (computing)|dynamically linked library]]. Each scanner manufacturer provides software that translates the API procedure calls into primitive commands that are issued to a hardware controller (such as the SCSI, USB, or FireWire controller). The manufacturer's part of the API is commonly called a [[device driver]], but that designation is not strictly accurate: the API does not run in kernel mode and does not directly access the device. Rather the scanner API library translates application requests into hardware requests.

Common scanner software API interfaces:

'''[[Scanner Access Now Easy|SANE]]''' (Scanner Access Now Easy) is a [[Free software|free]]/[[Open-source model|open-source]] API for accessing scanners. Originally developed for [[Unix]] and [[Linux]] operating systems, it has been ported to [[OS/2]], [[macOS|Mac OS X]], and [[Microsoft Windows]]. Unlike TWAIN, SANE does not handle the user interface. This allows batch scans and transparent network access without any special support from the device driver.

'''[[TWAIN]]''' is used by most scanners. Originally used for low-end and home-use equipment, it is now widely used for large-volume scanning.

'''[[Image and Scanner Interface Specification|ISIS]]''' (Image and Scanner Interface Specification) created by Pixel Translations, which still uses SCSI-II for performance reasons, is used by large, departmental-scale, machines.

'''[[Windows Image Acquisition|WIA]]''' (Windows Image Acquisition) is an API provided by Microsoft for use on [[Microsoft Windows]].

=== Bundled applications ===
Although no software beyond a scanning utility is a feature of any scanner, many scanners come bundled with software. Typically, in addition to the scanning utility, some type of image-editing application (such as [[Adobe Photoshop]]), and [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) software are supplied. OCR software converts graphical images of text into standard text that can be edited using common word-processing and text-editing software; accuracy is rarely perfect.

== Output data ==
Some scanners, especially those designed for scanning printed documents, only work in black-and-white but most modern scanners work in color. For the latter, the scanned result is a non-compressed RGB image, which can be transferred to a computer's memory. The color output of different scanners is not the same due to the spectral response of their sensing elements, the nature of their light source and the correction applied by the scanning software. While most image sensors have a linear response, the output values are usually [[Gamma correction|gamma compressed]]. Some scanners compress and clean up the image using embedded [[firmware]]. Once on the computer, the image can be processed with a [[raster graphics]] program (such as [[Adobe Photoshop]] or the [[GIMP]]) and saved on a storage device (such as a [[Hard disk drive|hard disk]]).

Images are usually stored on a [[Hard disk drive|hard disk]]. Pictures are normally stored in image formats such as uncompressed [[Bitmap]], "non-lossy" (lossless) compressed [[TIFF]] and [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], and "lossy" compressed [[JPEG]]. Documents are best stored in TIFF or [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] format; JPEG is particularly unsuitable for text. [[Optical character recognition]] (OCR) software allows a scanned image of text to be converted into editable text with reasonable accuracy, so long as the text is cleanly printed and in a typeface and size that can be read by the software. OCR capability may be integrated into the scanning software, or the scanned image file can be processed with a separate OCR program.

==Document processing==
[[File:Fujitsu ScanSnap fi-5100C tray open.jpeg|right|thumb|Document scanner]]
[[Document imaging]] requirements differ from those of image scanning. These requirements include scanning speed, automated paper feed, and the ability to automatically scan both the front and the back of a document. On the other hand, image scanning typically requires the ability to handle fragile and or three dimensional objects as well as scan at a much higher resolution.

Document scanners have [[Automatic document feeder|document feeders]], usually larger than those sometimes found on copiers or all-purpose scanners. Scans are made at high speed, from 20 up to 280&lt;ref name="pan"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://business.panasonic.com/KV-S8147-CV.html |title=KV-S8147-CV High Volume Production Scanner 140 ppm / 280 ipm with PremierOCR / PremierCOMPRESSION Software Bundle |website=business.panasonic.com |language=en |access-date=2017-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 420&lt;ref name="k5850"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alarisworld.com/en-us/solutions/document-scanners/production/i5850-scanner#Specifications|title=i5850 Scanner information and accessories - Kodak Alaris Information Management|last=Quayle|first=Mike|date=|website=www.alarisworld.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; pages per minute, often in grayscale, although many scanners support color. Many scanners can scan both sides of double-sided originals (duplex operation). Sophisticated document scanners have [[firmware]] or [[software]] that cleans up scans of text as they are produced, eliminating accidental marks and sharpening type; this would be unacceptable for photographic work, where marks cannot reliably be distinguished from desired fine detail. Files created are compressed as they are made.

The resolution used is usually from 150 to 300 [[Dots per inch|dpi]], although the hardware may be capable of 600&lt;ref name="k5850"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or higher resolution; this produces images of text good enough to read and for [[optical character recognition]] (OCR), without the higher demands on storage space required by higher-resolution images.

Document scans are often processed using [[optical character recognition|OCR]] technology to create editable and searchable files. Most scanners use [[Image and Scanner Interface Specification|ISIS]] or [[TWAIN]] device drivers to scan documents into [[TIFF]] format so that the scanned pages can be fed into a [[document management system]] that will handle the archiving and retrieval of the scanned pages. Lossy JPEG compression, which is very efficient for pictures, is undesirable for text documents, as slanted straight edges take on a jagged appearance, and solid black (or other color) text on a light background compresses well with lossless compression formats.

While paper feeding and scanning can be done automatically and quickly, preparation and indexing are necessary and require much work by humans. Preparation involves manually inspecting the papers to be scanned and making sure that they are in order, unfolded, without staples or anything else that might jam the scanner. Additionally, some industries such as legal and medical may require documents to have [[Bates numbering|Bates Numbering]] or some other mark giving a document identification number and date/time of the document scan.

Indexing involves associating relevant keywords to files so that they can be retrieved by content. This process can sometimes be automated to some extent, but it often requires manual labour performed by [[data entry clerk|data-entry clerks]]. One common practice is the use of [[barcode]]-recognition technology: during preparation, barcode sheets with folder names or index information are inserted into the document files, folders, and document groups. Using automatic batch scanning, the documents are saved into appropriate folders, and an index is created for integration into [[document management system|document-management systems]].

A specialized form of document scanning is [[book scanning]]. Technical difficulties arise from the books usually being bound and sometimes fragile and irreplaceable, but some manufacturers have developed specialized machinery to deal with this. Often special [[Robotics|robotic]] mechanisms are used to automate the page turning and scanning process.

==Document camera scanners==
[[File:SilverCreations - model "sceyeX" 10MP Document Scanner 03-2013.jpg|thumbnail|left|sceyeX document camera.]]

Another category of document scanner is the '''document camera'''. Capturing images on document cameras differs from that of flatbed and [[Automatic document feeder]] (ADF) scanners in that there are no moving parts required to scan the object. Conventionally either the illumination/reflector rod inside the scanner must be moved over the document (such as for a flatbed scanner), or the document must be passed over the rod (such as for feeder scanners) in order to produce a scan of a whole image. Document cameras capture the whole document or object in one step, usually instantly. Typically, documents are placed on a flat surface, usually the office desk, underneath the capture area of the document camera. The process of whole-surface-at-once capturing has the benefit of increasing reaction time for the work flow of scanning. After being captured, the images are usually processed through software which may enhance the image and perform such tasks like automatically rotating, cropping and straightening them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=sceye® - an innovative document scanner for the professional desktop.|url=http://graphics.kodak.com/docimaging/GB/en/products/document_scanners/document_cameras/sceyex/index.htm?_requestid=3705|publisher=Kodak|accessdate=6 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518075034/http://graphics.kodak.com/docimaging/GB/en/products/document_scanners/document_cameras/sceyex/index.htm?_requestid=3705|archivedate=18 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not required that the documents or objects being scanned make contact with the document camera, therefore increasing flexibility of the types of documents which are able to be scanned. Objects which have previously been difficult to scan on conventional scanners are now able to be done so with one device. This includes in particular documents which are of varying sizes and shapes, stapled, in folders or bent/crumpled which may get jammed in a feed scanner. Other objects include books, magazines, receipts, letters, tickets etc. No moving parts can also remove the need for maintenance, a consideration in the [[Total cost of ownership]], which includes the continuing operational costs of scanners.

Increased reaction time whilst scanning also has benefits in the realm of context-scanning. ADF scanners, whilst very fast and very good at batch scanning, also require pre- and post- processing of the documents. Document cameras are able to be integrated directly into a [[Workflow]] or process, for example a teller at a bank. The document is scanned directly in the context of the customer, in which it is to be placed or used. Reaction time is an advantage in these situations. Document cameras usually also require a small amount of space and are often portable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why should you choose sceye?|url=http://www.sceye.eu/en/product/why-choose-sceye|publisher=SilverCreations Ag|accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst scanning with document cameras may have a quick reaction time, large amounts of batch scanning of even, unstapled documents is more efficient with an ADF scanner. There are challenges which face this kind of technology regarding external factors (such as lighting) which may have influence on the scan results. The way in which these issues are resolved strongly depends on the sophistication of the product and how it deals with these issues.

== Infrared cleaning ==
{{Main article|Infrared cleaning}}
'''Infrared cleaning''' is a technique used to remove the effects of dust and scratches on images scanned from film; many modern scanners incorporate this feature. It works by scanning the film with infrared light; the dyes in typical color film emulsions are transparent to infrared light, but dust and scratches are not, and block infrared; scanner software can use the visible and infrared information to detect scratches and process the image to greatly reduce their visibility, considering their position, size, shape, and surroundings.

Scanner manufacturers usually have their own name attached to this technique. For example, [[Seiko Epson|Epson]], [[Minolta]], [[Nikon]], [[Konica Minolta]], [[Microtek]], and others use [[Digital ICE]], while [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] uses its own system [[Infrared cleaning|FARE]] (Film Automatic Retouching and Enhancement system).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canon.com/technology/canon_tech/explanation/fare.html |publisher=Canon |accessdate=2007-05-02 |title=Film Automatic Retouching and Enhancement |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023211251/http://www.canon.com/technology/canon_tech/explanation/fare.html |archivedate=2010-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plustek]] uses [[LaserSoft Imaging]] [[iSRD]].  Some independent software developers design infrared cleaning tools.

==Other uses==
Flatbed scanners have been used as [[Digital camera back|digital backs]] for [[Large format|large-format]] [[camera]]s to create high-resolution digital images of static subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://golembewski.awardspace.com/cameras/index.html][http://golembewski.awardspace.com/cameras/index.html] The Scanner Photography Project&lt;/ref&gt; A modified flatbed scanner has been used for documentation and quantification of [[Thin-layer chromatography|thin layer chromatograms]] detected by [[Quenching (fluorescence)|fluorescence quenching]] on [[silica gel]] layers containing an [[ultraviolet]] (UV) indicator.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, A., Chejlava, M.J and Sherma, J.

An '''interstellar ark''' or [[generation ship]] is a conceptual [[spacecraft|space vehicle]] designed for [[interstellar travel]]. Interstellar arks may be the most economically feasible method of traveling such distances. The ark has also been proposed as a potential habitat to preserve civilization and knowledge in the event of a global catastrophe.

Such a ship would have to be large, requiring a large power plant. The [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]] concept of [[nuclear pulse propulsion|propulsion by nuclear pulses]] has been proposed. The largest spacecraft design analyzed in Project Orion had a 400&amp;nbsp;m diameter and weighed approximately 8 million tons. It could be large enough to host a city of 100,000 or more people.

== Thrust concepts ==
Another concern is selection of power sources and mechanisms which would remain viable for the long time spans involved in [[interstellar travel]] through the desert of space. The longest lived space probes are the [[Voyager program]] probes, which use [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s having a useful lifespan of a mere 50 years.

One propulsion method for a crewed spacecraft could be a fusion microexplosion [[nuclear pulse propulsion]] system, like that proposed in [[Project Daedalus]] {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} that may allow it to obtain an interstellar cruising velocity of up to 10% of the [[speed of light]]. However, if the ship is capable of transits requiring hundreds of thousands of years, chemical and [[Gravity assist|gravitational slingshot]] propulsion may be sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;R.W. Moir and W.L. Barr (2005) [http://ralphmoir.com/media/jBIS.pdf "Analysis of Interstellar Spacecraft Cycling between the Sun and the Near Stars"] ''Journal of the British Interplanetary Society'' '''58,''' pp.332–341&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederik Ceyssens, Maarten Driesen, Kristof Wouters, Pieter-Jan Ceyssens, Lianggong Wen (2011) [https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1109/1109.5318.pdf "Organizing and financing interstellar space projects – A bottom-up approach"] (DARPA/NASA, Orlando, Florida: [http://100yss.org/ 100 Year Starship conference])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specific proposals and research projects ==

* The [[Enzmann starship]] proposed in 1964 is a large fusion-powered spacecraft that could function as an interstellar ark, supporting a crew of 200 with extra space for expansion, on multi-year journeys at subluminal speeds to nearby star systems.&lt;ref name=ridpath78&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=REEIAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Enzmann+starship&amp;dq=Enzmann+starship&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=d5LmTOfOGIP_8AbYpLWvDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCQ Ian Ridpath – '''Messages from the stars: communication and contact with extraterrestrial life''' (1978, Harper &amp; Row, 241 pages) = Google Books 2010], Snippet View: "As long ago as 1964, Robert D. Enzmann of the Raytheon Corporation proposed an interstellar ark driven by eight nuclear pulse rockets. The living quarters of the starship, habitable by 200 people but with room for growth ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1955 [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]] considered nuclear propulsion for spacecraft, suitable for deep space voyages.

* In 1973-1978 [[Project Daedalus]] was conducted by the [[British Interplanetary Society]] to study unmanned interstellar spacecraft.

'''Jakob Heusser-Staub''' (3 March 1862 – 23 August 1941 as '''Jakob Heusser''') was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] industrialist and philanthropist. Born and raised in the village of [[Irgenhausen]], Heusser-Staub made [[Uster]] his home.  With the support of his wife, Berta, he founded the ''Heusser-Staub'' foundation.
[[File:Uster - Schloss - Innenansicht - Rittersaal - Berta und Jakob-Heusser-Staub 2015-09-20 15-50-25.JPG|thumb|upright|stained glass window dedicated to Berta and Jakob Heusser-Staub in the [[Uster Castle]]]]

== Early life and education ==
Born in the hamlet of [[Irgenhausen]] in the [[Municipalities of the canton of Zürich|municipality]] of [[Wetzikon]], he was the son of Luise née Schellenberg and Caspar. He attended ''Sekundarschule'' (pre-college level) in Wetzikon and was a citizen of [[Pfäffikon ZH|Pfäffikon]]. From 1877 to 1879, he attended the Industrial School in Zürich. Afterwards he received practical and commercial training at his father's business.&lt;ref name="hds-jakobheusser"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D30921.php|title=Heusser, Jakob|publisher=HDS|author=Markus Bürgi|language=German|date=2007-12-13|accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Caspar Heusser (1836–1910), was a cotton manufacturer who sold his products in [[Kempten ZH|Kempten]] and the surrounding area. 

His professional success enabled him to purchase the ''Spinnerei Stauber'' in Kempten (with 1,200 spindles) in 1869 and to introduce mechanical weaving with 36 machines. In 1883 he bought a cotton mill in Bubikon (6,000 spindles, 80 workers), where he also added a weaving factory. Heusser expanded to Winterthur and St. Gallen, leaving a considerable fortune.&lt;ref name="hds-casparheusser"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D30920.php|title=Heusser, Caspar|publisher=HDS|author=Markus Bürgi|language=German|date=2006-08-30|accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He lived from 1880 to 1882 in Lyon and from 1882 to 1883 in England to gain professional experience. From 1883 to 1897 he served as trade merchant in his father's business in [[Bubikon]], from 1897 independently as his own factory.&lt;ref name="hds-jakobheusser" /&gt;

== Becoming an industrialist ==
In 1900, Jakob Heusser became a textile industrialist in the city of [[Uster]], the industrial centre of the region. He purchased the Boller mill in Uster, and developed it to produce quality yarns. 

In 1910 he inherited the paternal factories and in 1917 bought the spinning factory Huber in Uster, which he modernized in 1928. Beginning in 1919 Heusser held the majority share of the textile factory Schiesser AG, with factories in Radolfzell and Kreuzlingen, and in 1929 he gained control of the cotton spinning and weaving factory, Wettingen, which he also modernized. Moreover, Heusser was involved in the short-lived Swiss car factory [[Turicum (automobile)|Turicum]]. He acquired the majority of shares of the "Fabrik für Electrische Geräte" from Alfred Zellweger, the later [[Zellweger Uster]] AG. 

Heusser was also involved in the "Aluminium Industrie AG" (now [[Alusuisse]]). He was a member of the board from 1924 to 1939, and from 1918 to 1939 he also sat on the board of "Maschinenfabrik Rieter". His involvement in the Terpena AG in the manufacturing of artificial camphor in the early 1930s was a financial fiasco, but in 1938 the activities of the spinning and weaving companies (except of "Spinnerei Wettingen") were summarized in the holding company "Heusser-Staub AG" and all other companies in the "Hesta" (He[usser]-sta[ub]) holding.

During the interwar period Heusser became the most important industrialist of the Zürich Oberland region. In 1900 he employed about 60 workers and produced about ten tons of yarn per year. In 1950 there were 230 workers who produced about 50 to 60 tons of yarn per year.&lt;ref name="hds-jakobheusser" /&gt;

== Philanthropist activities ==

[[File:Uster - Schloss - Plateau 2015-09-20 16-35-32.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Uster Castle]]]]
Berta and Jakob Heusser-Staub supported projects of labour welfare. In 1917 the [[Uster Castle]] was acquired and renovated to house an agricultural and domestic managenment school.&lt;ref name="staatsarchiv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://suche.staatsarchiv.djiktzh.ch/detail.aspx?ID=20672|title=Z 2.1361 HAUSWIRTSCHAFTLICHE SCHULE AUF SCHLOSS USTER, HEUSSER-STAUB STIFTUNG, Uster Haushaltsunterricht für Töchter (1918-1935)|publisher=[[Staatsarchiv des Kantons Zürich]]|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was given to the citizenry of Uster to establish the "Heusser-Staub-Stiftung". In the same year, Heusser and his wife Berta were appointed honorary citizens of Uster.&lt;ref name="hds-uster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D135.php|title=Uster (Gemeinde)|publisher=HDS|author=Bruno Schmid|language=German|date=2014-01-14|accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The premise of the 6-part show was to bring favourite toys of the past into the modern era, by using the toys in real life large scale enterprises. In each episode, he also explores the history of each toy. A few stars of the show include [[Airfix]] model planes, [[plasticine]] modelling material, [[Meccano]] construction toys, [[Scalextric]] cars and [[Lego]].

==Background==
May's interest in technology is known from his presentation of such programmes as ''[[James May's 20th Century]]'' and ''[[James May's Big Ideas]]''. He credits much of the inventiveness of humans to the love of playing with toys and he has credited many technological developments to men playing in sheds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dolling |first=Phil |author2=James May |title=James May's Magnificent Machines: How Men in Sheds Have Changed Our Lives |publisher=Hodder Paperback |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-340-95092-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has shown his passion for toys in programmes he has presented including ''[[James May's Top Toys]]'' and ''[[James May: My Sisters' Top Toys]]'' and he has discussed his desire for children to get away from games consoles and play with real toys preferably with their parents.&lt;ref name = "bbc press office" /&gt; May was quoted as saying:

{{cquote|For too long now we have regarded the great toys as mere playthings. It's time to use them to bring people together and achieve greatness. And I bet it'll be a right laugh as well.&lt;ref name="bbc press office" /&gt;}}

== Episode list ==
Many of the plans involved significant engineering problems, so the programme makers searched for [[architect]]s, [[designer]]s and [[engineer]]s to help them.&lt;ref name = "IofSE" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://istructe.org/news/Pages/BBCneedse.aspx |title=BBC in need of structural engineers |publisher=Institution of Structural Engineers |accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many more volunteers would be required as a labour force, so appeals for volunteers were distributed in local newspapers.

The ambitious - world record-breaking in many cases - projects included:&lt;ref name="bbc press office"/&gt;

James successfully constructed one of Airfix's models of a Spitfire, but to a scale of 1:1, which was done by having the pieces constructed out of fibreglass by Gateguards in Cornwall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gateguardsuk.com/news.html|title=Gateguards News|accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the fibreglass pieces had been made, it became clear, through testing, that they couldn't support their own weight without internal supports, which were added to ensure it would be strong. The model was completed by a group of school children, who had been recruited to work on the model after being introduced to Airfix at their school. They ensured the model was not only made, but painted, and then presented to a crowd of their parents and RAF WWII veterans, before later being put on display at the [[Royal Air Force Museum Cosford]] until November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rafmuseum.org.uk/cosford/news/article.cfm?news_id=262|title=Last Chance To View James May’s Spitfire|publisher=Royal Air Force Museum|accessdate=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010, the Spitfire returned to Cosford's ''Hangar 1''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/cosford/news/article.cfm?headline=James%20May's%20Airfix%20Spitfire:%20Back%20by%20popular%20demand!|title=James May's Airfix Spitfire: Back by popular demand!|publisher=Royal Air Force Museum|accessdate=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bridge consisted of two parts - a [[swing bridge]], and a rolling [[bascule bridge]] - which in total weighed about {{frac|1|2}} tonne. It took a combined total of 20 students and technicians, more than 10 weeks to build, enlisting further help from the University of Liverpool's engineering department to manage the project. The bridge's two sides had 14 sections within the swing side and 22 sections within the bascule side, with each section requiring around 40 hours to build to a sufficient standard. It was situated in the heart of [[Liverpool]]'s newly redeveloped [[Pier Head]]. As the home to Meccano for more than 70 years during the running of the Binns Road 'factory of dreams' until 1979, Liverpool was an appropriate location for the bridge. It was also believed to be a new [[world record]] for the biggest Meccano bridge ever built, with over 100,000 individual parts per side &amp;mdash; including 28,000 bolts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://building.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=3146611 |title=James May walks across Atkins' Meccano bridge in Liverpool |accessdate=4 September 2009 |first=Jane |last=Sheils |date=20 October 2009 |work=Building}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the successful completion of the project the student project managers were invited to the Lego House in Episode 5 for a party as a reward for their efforts.

Both sections of the bridge have remained at the University of Liverpool, with one of the two sections on public display within the engineering department.

The project faced a number of obstacles as James insisted on using the route of the original Brooklands track, most of which has now been demolished and built over. Obstacles including residential housing, commercial buildings, fences, a road, and the most challenging obstacle — a large pond. The track broke the world record for the longest successful Scalextric track, with the previous record measuring {{convert|1.59|mi|km}}.

The race had two teams — volunteers and residents of [[Brooklands]] against "Scalextric Professionals". The race used multiple drivers in a relay, with each 'driver' racing one part of track as a single power unit could not power the whole track and one person would not be able to run the length of the track. The cars briefly stopped due to crashing off the track, the contacts acquiring dirt and flawed changeovers. [[Tiff Needell]] guested as the race reporter. The volunteers raced a maroon [[Aston Martin DB9]] model and the professionals raced a silver [[Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren]].&lt;ref name="Scalextric James Mays Toy Stories"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scalextric.com/shop/james-mays-toy-stories/ |title=Scalextric James Mays Toy Stories |accessdate=23 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aston Martin won the race by a few minutes.&lt;ref&gt;

Overall, the construction project overran by one month.

After the filming of the programme, the programme-makers attempted to sell the house to the [[Legoland]] theme park in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]]. However, the cost of dismantling and reassembling it was estimated at £50,000 which was judged to be too expensive, which led to the deal not going through as a result.&lt;ref name="Lego BBC demolition1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8266896.stm |title=May's Lego house faces demolition |accessdate=21 September 2009 |date=21 September 2009 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having spent one night in the house, May said: "I slept in it on Friday and had the best night's sleep for a long time.

He sarcastically stated on air that he "hated" the volunteer who did this, as it upset the colour and balance of the house.

May, who had previously identified the train set as his "absolute favourite"&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|zZ8IjZ3tUas|James May's Top Toys}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to build the world's longest model railway. The team hoped that a train would run successfully along the length of the track, built on the picturesque [[Tarka Trail]] &amp;ndash; a disused {{convert|37|mi|km|adj=on}} long railway line acquired by the local council in 1990 and which was converted for use as an off-road cycle track.&lt;ref name="TarkaProject"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tarka-country.co.uk/tarkaproject/recinfra.html |title=Recreational Infrastructure: Tarka Trail |accessdate=31 July 2009 |publisher=Tarka Country |work=Tarka Project |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515170916/http://www.tarka-country.co.uk/tarkaproject/recinfra.html |archivedate=15 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; May chose the site because he thought that people wanted to see a line rebuilt there and because of the dramatic scenery. May joined 400 enthusiasts, including students from [[Petroc College|Petroc]], to build the miniature railway stretching {{convert|10|mi|km}} from [[Barnstaple]] to [[Bideford]], in [[North Devon]].&lt;ref name="Railway Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/6088019/Vandals-disrupt-Top-Gear-presenter-James-Mays-model-train-record-bid.html |title=Vandals disrupt Top Gear presenter James May's model train record bid |work=The Telegraph |location=London |date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attempt by James and his team was disrupted by vandals and thieves, however, who interfered with the track; coins were dropped onto the line, causing short circuits, while parts of the track were taken.&lt;ref name="Railway Telegraph" /&gt;
Weather also added problems of blocked lines and damage to the fragile track, leading to several derailments, as was shown in the programme.

Simon Kohler, marketing manager of [[Hornby Railways|Hornby model railways]], said that the train which travels at just {{convert|1|mph|km/h}} failed two miles short of Bideford station; but he also told BBC news "Even though the last locomotive gave up the ghost at Instow, we did link the track."&lt;ref name="Railway Telegraph"/&gt;

As shown in the programme, five trains set off on the track. The first, James' own 1970s-vintage ''[[LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman|Flying Scotsman]]'' model with realistic chuffing sound, failed very early (it had been out of use for many years). Three of the other trains were chosen to reflect the original services on the line: a steam-hauled passenger train (a [[SR West Country and Battle of Britain classes|rebuilt SR 'West Country' class]] locomotive and [[Pullman (car or coach)|Pullman]] coaches), to represent the ''[[Atlantic Coast Express]]''; a diesel-hauled passenger train (a [[British Rail Class 42|BR Class 42 ''Warship'']] with [[British Railways Mark 1|Mark 1 coaches]]), to represent the 'everyday' passenger services; a diesel-hauled goods train ([[DB Cargo UK|EWS]]-liveried [[British Rail Class 37|Class 37]] and hopper wagons), to represent the clay trains that ran to [[Fremington, Devon|Fremington Quay]].  The fifth train used, was the prototype of Hornby's [[British Rail Class 395|Class 395 "Javelin"]] model.&lt;ref name="Railway Telegraph" /&gt;&lt;!--Ref contains a picture showing the five trains--&gt; Passing sections allowed the faster models to overtake the slower ones, however on several occasions slower trains had to be physically lifted out of the way; The "West Country" locomotive had been carried by [[Oz Clarke]] on trains from [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]] to Barnstaple, to replicate the original route of the ''Atlantic Coast Express''. All of the trains eventually came to a stop (the goods train was stopped where it would normally do so), with the Javelin being the last train running but failing to reach the final destination.

After the failure of the first attempt, a new toy train challenge occurred on 16 April 2011, as a redo of the original plan, but with a twist, with the episode aired on 12 June that year.&lt;ref name="BBC_GTR"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Great Train Race |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0120z75 |work=(Programme listing) |publisher=BBC |accessdate=7 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zR5MdVuq?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0120z75 |archivedate=14 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- NB: video clip and some formatting lost during archiving process --&gt; A team composed of Germans from the ''[[Miniatur Wunderland]]'' (including one of its founders), who had assisted in the first toy train attempt, raced against a team from Britain, again between {{stnlnk|Barnstaple}} and {{stnlnk|Bideford}} in [[North Devon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://transmission.blogs.topgear.com/2011/04/11/attention-all-devon-based-may-fans/ |title=Attention all Devon-based May fans |work=Transmission: Top Gear Blog |date=11 April 2011 |accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new challenge was to race three different types of trains from one end of the track and see who could get to the other station first - The Germans from Bideford, the British from Barnstaple - with each team starting at opposite ends. As well as reuniting previous collaborators, including his friend [[Oz Clarke]], May asked for help from the local marines to guard the components; this stopped the theft of batteries and track, as well as short circuits caused by the placing of coins on the track, which occurred on the previous attempt. A different, sturdier type of track was used, as was a new battery system to power it; the length of track was divided into 100 yard insulated sections with two batteries per train; the operators would leapfrog each other as each train progressed from one section to the next. This time, for most of the route, two parallel tracks were laid to avoid the opposing trains meeting head-on. The British model trains (and the track) were made by [[Hornby Railways]], while the German model trains used were made under the [[Rivarossi]] brand, which is also owned by Hornby.

The German Team started at Bideford and the British Team at Barnstaple. The race was a best of three rounds. The first round used steam locomotives, the Germans using a model German [[DR Class 58.30]] and the British using James' own childhood model of [[LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman|LNER Class A3 4472 ''Flying Scotsman'']] – "with realistic chuffing sound", driven by Oz Clarke. Following the last attempt, James had dismantled, cleaned and repaired the whole model piece by piece before reassembly, making it supposedly the finest example of its kind in the country. The second race involved a German [[DB Class 403]] electric train, nicknamed the "[[Donald Duck]]", and a British Rail [[InterCity 125]]. The third round featured modified trains driven by any power source the teams could come up with:

* The German team originally used fermented [[sauerkraut]] to power a small piston engine motor, which started quickly but then fell off the track and exploded. The backup was a standard [[EuroSprinter]] ES 64 P electric locomotive, powered by a bank of lithium-ion cells instead of electricity supplied from the track.
* The British team tried a train based on a [[ducted fan]] propelling a [[British Rail Class 395]], which while extremely fast, proved too unstable and lacked brakes. It quickly derailed, breaking several wheels in the process. The replacement used an electric motor [[fuel cell vehicle|driven by a hydrogen fuel cell]], the workings of which were disguised by an over-scale [[Thomas the Tank Engine]] body (although this was removed for much of the route as it made it top heavy).

The Germans were the first to complete the full journey with the Donald Duck. The British then won the second round with their hydrogen fuel cell train, and the third round was also won by the British with the ''Flying Scotsman'' after the German DR58 steam locomotive had problems. James May, after the crushing disappointment from the first attempt, was emotional that his ''Flying Scotsman'' model had made it to Bideford, and was delighted that the mechanically generated "realistic chuffing sound" was still working.

All six trains eventually arrived at their destination, though during the challenge, several of the engines that finished had problems which were fixed en route. The ''Flying Scotsman'' had to have a new chassis block, while the "Donald Duck" had two breakdowns due to a faulty gearbox, with both within view of their finishing point.  Meanwhile, both experimental trains that finished had reliable power sources but major issues with top-heavy stability, with the EuroSprinter battery powered engine also suffering with gearbox trouble, while the German steam DR58 limped along very slowly with unspecified problems to finish last of all the trains several hours after the others, arriving at Barnstaple by 2:20am.

In August 2012, James May and his team decided to take on a new challenge - to build a model glider to a scale of 1:1, and to fly it across the [[English Channel]], as part of a record-setting achievement. The model kit chosen was of the [[Slingsby Swallow]] which he described as "reminiscent of the Keil-Kraft type of gliders I built as a kid". The original plan was to launch the glider from a balloon from a height of {{convert|8000|ft|m|0}}, at the shortest points between Britain and France. However, due to the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympics]] and French [[Air Traffic Control|air traffic control]], they were unable to fly the glider across the Channel; even when their glider was classified as a drone. Instead it was decided that the glider would be flown from Ilfracombe, in [[Devon]], across the [[Bristol Channel]] to [[South Wales]]. This was the same distance - {{convert|22|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} - as across the English Channel at its narrowest point. The project had support from "Simmy" (Simeon Oakley), an engineer who has appeared in ''[[James May's Man Lab]]'', along with aerospace engineering students from [[Brunel University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/news-items/ne_257498 "Brunel engineering students to star in BBC programme with James May"] 10 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Their plan had further changes made.  Firstly, it was also decided that the launch would be done from a helicopter in order to control it, while the original model design was given new wings to increase its [[glide ratio]]. Due to delays and low cloud it was launched from below {{convert|4000|ft|m|0}} and as such it only flew {{convert|2|mi|km|1|abbr=on}} before landing in the sea. On the following day the weather was clear and a second attempt was made from the same location but from an altitude of more than {{convert|9000|ft|m|0}}. However, due to the wind on the day blowing from the East it was launched towards [[Lundy]], an island in the [[Bristol Channel]], which it reached and landed on, in approximately one hour, achieving what they set out to do.

Following James May's successful attempt to create a bridge out of Meccano in Liverpool back in 2009, a new challenge was made to see if the mechanical toy could be used to create a fully working motorcycle, and then ride it across the [[Isle of Man]].&lt;ref name="Meccano TT BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-23898497 |title=Top Gear's James May laps TT course on Meccano bike |accessdate=3 June 2014 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, for one lap of the island's famous TT Course, in 2013.  The challenge was a daunting one, consisting of many technical and mechanical problems with the bike being made out of Meccano, alongside other issues. The first problem faced was from the island's government, which only gave the go-ahead for the bike to partake in travelling the TT Course, as long as the show promoted the tourism for the area; this led to the bike having to include a sidecar for Oz Clarke, who was brought in to handle the tourism matter. Construction of the bike was slow because of the parts needed, making a chain for the bike, for example, was a time consuming process since they were creating a full-sized functioning bike rather than a small model. Despite being slightly behind schedule, the construction of the bike was completed just a day before the challenge was to be started. As in previous episodes of Toy Stories, the engineering side to the construction was overseen by Sim Oakley.&lt;ref name="Meccano TT MBT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.motorbiketimes.com/news/people/celebrity/the-story-behind-james-may-s-meccano-isle-of-man-motorbike-$21383127.htm |title=The story behind James May's Meccano Isle of Man motorbike | author = Ruchi Srivastava |accessdate=3 June 2014 |publisher=Motorbike Times |date=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while the construction had been problematic, the bulk of the problems faced in the challenge only truly began when the main task was to be started.  The first problem faced came when the bike's brakes were being tested by the team to ensure that they worked, on the night before the challenge would begin; the front ones were found to be too firm for the Meccano pieces, as they crippled the front wheel and ruined the front forks, forcing the team to repair the damage by remaking the parts. Then the bike had to undertake a [[MOT test]] before it could be allowed to perform on the road and the course, which it managed to pass after a worrying amount of time. The next issue came from an unexpected matter; the practice session for the Grand Prix of the main race was cancelled while the group were filming the bike in all its glory, forcing the team to start earlier than had been planned. Despite these initial issues that were faced, the bike was able to function and move on its own power, and began the task in hand, with a police escort protecting it from local traffic as it drove along the course.

However, further problems were soon encountered after it started. The power for the bike was not strong enough as they had hoped for; despite it using several Meccano motors that would be more suited for smaller models, but had been fashioned in a way to work with the bike like a full sized engine, they could not supply the power needed for it to tackle hills or give it good enough speed to cover the length of the course. This led to a motor from a golf buggy (described as Plan B by May), to be used to supply more power, but even this could not get the bike far enough for the pair's liking; only a few miles were covered before May and Clarke had to stop for the night, much to May's disappointment, as they were not allowed to drive the bike at night due to strict rules. The bike had to be carted away for emergency repairs to evaluate the issues.

The following day, the group had to complete much more distance than had been hoped, and continued to have further problems, which began from the back wheel becoming a major issue and needing repairs, and also from the lack of speed, which was needed to cover the remaining miles; the group had to complete the challenge before the TT Race was to be officially started, otherwise they would have to stop and try again another time. Oz was abandoned to tour the island's sights and remove unwanted weight, while May continued on with the challenge, suffering further problems with power, which had origins of a mysterious nature that could not be found. The slowdowns to make repairs to these issues and more, cost time they did not have to spare.

Despite the issues faced, the bike managed to complete the majority of the course into the late hours after gaining special permission to do so, and gaining unexpected power to help it cross the mountains. May and Clarke were reunited just before entering Douglas, where the finish line lay in sight.&lt;ref name="Meccano TT BBC"/&gt;  All of the issues faced could not prevent them from crossing it, and the pair received cheers of celebrations from the waiting crowds for completing the challenge within time, whereupon Clarke performed the traditional racing celebration; spraying champagne over May. James ended the challenge by questioning what could be done next with Meccano, commenting that making a space craft with the toy would be very unlikely.

| ShortSummary    = 2014 Special: James May attempts to rehabilitate one of Britain's most derided toys by seeing if it is possible for Action Man to do what no toy has ever managed - travel faster than the speed of sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Two - James May's Toy Stories, Action Man at the Speed of Sound}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2014, a brand new challenge was devised, involving the [[Action Man]] doll. The idea was simple - to see if a toy (the doll in particular) could break the sound-barrier, and travel faster than the speed of sound (Mach 1) as a result, something that had not been attempted before with any existing toy.  In order to achieve the goal, James and his team, including Sim Oakley, the team's engineer, initially thought of replicating a Eurofighter jet aircraft,  by using an Action Man sized replica model plane for the doll to use, which would be launched by any potential method that could help it achieve the needed speed. But when testing this possibility out with an air cannon (designed to test real aircraft components), the model plane they used broke apart the moment it was launched at high speed. James had been concerned about the use of the model plane, so the sudden event meant the idea was no longer feasible, and was promptly scrapped.

This led to the team looking at notable historical events that involved breaking the sound-barrier including the [[Bell X-1|first manned aircraft to break the sound-barrier]] in 1947, and the freefall jump by [[Felix Baumgartner]] in 2012.  Baumgartner's jump was chosen as the template for the next attempt; a weather balloon, from which a capsule containing Action Man would be dropped at a set height of {{convert|105,000|ft|abbr=on}} with the doll parachuting safely to earth. Recording sensors would determine the speed the toy had achieved. The first try at launching it failed, as while James was being filmed with the idea, a sudden gust of wind caught the balloon's handler, Steve Randall, off guard and forced it out into open air, with the wind causing the capsule to come apart. On their second attempt, despite  passing through a storm and risk of freezing water damage, the Action man successfully dropped. However, the target speed of 672&amp;nbsp;mph had not been met; a maximum of 249.5&amp;nbsp;mph was actually recorded. A test using Britain's only working supersonic air cannon to see how the toy would handle supersonic speeds when free-falling, showed Action Man would have broken up if it had gone supersonic and so further attempts of the idea were scrapped.

Following the failure, the decision was made to look back over their research again, and Chuck Yeager's efforts in the Bell X-1 were this time used as a template; more precisely, the decision was made to use a rocket to achieve the speed needed, detaching the doll from it and parachuting it down to safety.  As phone calls were made to find rocket experts to help out with this next venture, James and Sim tested out their template's theory with a prototype, using a commercial firework in which Action Man was attached to it, with a parachute and a small charge to detach the doll from the rocket; this test went wrong, however, as the charge was more powerful than expected, and the doll was destroyed as a result, nearly hitting the pair.  While they decided to redesign the rocket to something that could be more feasible along with replacing the doll, the group discovered that their calls for help on the challenge had prompted a rival outfit, composed of rocket enthusiasts, to make their own attempt and be the first ones to get a toy to achieve supersonic speed; led by Dr. Russ Strand, a system engineer, they decided to use the doll, [[Sindy]], to rival James' team, and opted to design a rocket with a one-stage fuel cell.  Seeking to beat them, James' team worked hard on creating a two-stage rocket, with boosters, electronic components and cameras to both record the attempt and track down the toy, along with a compartment for Action Man.  The team spent their time working on the components and testing out the bits that were essential to them; while testing out fuels to use, a home-made batch proved so potent and powerful, it knocked the testing rig for the rocket engine, which weighed 180&amp;nbsp;kilos, out of its place, along with the monitoring equipment. The doll's parachute was also tested with a sky-diving group to see if it worked (as it should do, based on a 70s advert about it), and was found to do excellently as a result (though recovering the doll and parachute took awhile), and later during a toy fair, while recruiting more dolls for the attempt, James May found an Action Man space suit from the 60s, and decided to outfit the doll in the clothing for their attempt.

Just before the group were ready to complete their rocket, news came to them that their rivals, aptly named "Team Sindy", had finished their rocket, so seeking to join them, James and Sim watched as Strand and his team launched it in Scotland, achieving their target speed with great success (they had to await confirmation of this), and thus becoming the first people to have a toy break the sound-barrier and achieve supersonic speed.  However, a mission statement for the attempt was that the doll had to be recovered after it landed, but Team Sindy couldn't track it down after it came back to earth, even after three days; the team found the Sindy doll eventually, just three hours after James's team had made their attempt.  With Action Man's rocket completed after their rival's launch, James and Sim returned to their team to watch and see how it fared, although they hadn't tested out the rocket itself before setting up for the launch.  A wide-open testing ground was chosen to launch it, Otterburn Range in Northumberland, as a safety precaution, but despite concerns before the launch, and the failure of the doll's parachute not working afterwards, let alone the doll separating from the descending rocket, the team achieved success; not only did they achieve supersonic speed as well, they had gone faster than Sindy had done, as while it had achieved Mach 1.02, Action Man achieved Mach 1.1 in the team's attempt.

''' Joseph Frederick Engelberger''' (July 26, 1925 – December 1, 2015) was an American physicist,  engineer and entrepreneur. Licensing the original patent awarded to inventor [[George Devol]], Engelberger developed the first [[industrial robot]] in the United States, the [[Unimate]], in the 1950s. Later, he worked as entrepreneur and vocal advocate of robotic technology beyond the manufacturing plant in a variety of fields, including service industries, health care, and space exploration. He has been called "the father of robotics" for his contributions to the field.&lt;ref name="robotics1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robotics.org/joseph-engelberger/about.cfm|publisher=Robotics Industries Association|accessdate=December 1, 2015|title=JOSEPH ENGELBERGER // The Father of Robotics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mmh"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmh.com/article/joseph_f._engelberger_the_father_of_robotics_turns_90|work=Modern Materials Handling|title=Joseph F. Engelberger, the "Father of Robotics," turns 90|date=July 27, 2015|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Engelberger did much for the development of robotics, the honor of  being called "the father of robotics" rightly belongs to George Devol, and should be qualified as "the father of industrial robotics".

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Joseph Frederick Engelberger was born on July 26, 1925, in [[Brooklyn]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Joseph F. Engelberger, pioneer of robotics, dies at 90|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/joseph-f-engelberger-pioneer-of-robotics-dies-at-90/2015/12/04/02f21612-99d0-11e5-b499-76cbec161973_story.html|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2015-12-04|access-date = 2016-01-05|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Emily|last = Langer}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Connecticut]] during the [[Great Depression]], but later returned to New York City for his college education.&lt;ref name="angelo"&gt;''Robotics: A Reference Guide to the New Technology'' (2006) by Joseph A. Angelo {{ISBN|978-1573563376}}, pp. 104-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Engelberger received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in physics in 1946, and [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in Electric Engineering in 1949 from Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;''Robotics, Vision and Control: Fundamental Algorithms in MATLAB'' (2011) by Peter Corke {{ISBN|978-3642201431}}, pp. 3&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as an engineer with [[Manning, Maxwell and Moore]], where he met inventor [[George Devol]] at a [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]] cocktail party in 1956,&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/1997-03-02/invasion-of-the-robots|work=Businessweek|title=Invasion Of The Robots|date=March 2, 1997|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; two years after Devol had designed and patented a rudimentary industrial robotic arm.&lt;ref name="angelo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="botmag"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.botmag.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-unimation-inc-story-of-robotics-innovation-triumph-that-changed-the-world/|title=THE RISE AND FALL OF UNIMATION, INC. – Story of robotics innovation &amp; triumph that changed the world!|date=December 2, 2010|first=George|last=Munson|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="henderson"&gt;''Modern Robotics: Building Versatile Machines'' (2006) by Harry Henderson {{ISBN|978-0816057450}}, pp. 31-4&lt;/ref&gt; However, Manning, Maxwell and Moore was sold and Engelberger's division was closed that year.&lt;ref name="leider"&gt;''Robots: Explore the World of Robots and How They Work for Us'' (2015) by Rick Leider {{ISBN|978-1632204394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unimation===
Finding himself jobless but with a business partner and an idea, Engelberger co-founded [[Unimation]] with Devol, creating the world's first robotics company.&lt;ref name="botmag"/&gt;&lt;ref name="leider"/&gt; In 1957, he also founded Consolidated Controls Corporation.&lt;ref name="henderson"/&gt; As president of Unimation, Engelberger collaborated with Devol to engineer and produce an industrial robot under the brand name [[Unimate]]. The first Unimate robotic arm was installed at a [[General Motors]] Plant in [[Ewing Township, New Jersey]], in 1961.&lt;ref name="razor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.razorrobotics.com/robotics/Unimate|title=Unimate|publisher=Razor Robotics|accessdate=December 1, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208044551/https://www.razorrobotics.com/robotics/Unimate|archivedate=December 8, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/business/george-devol-developer-of-robot-arm-dies-at-99.html?_r=0|title=George C.

The introduction of robotics to the manufacturing process effectively transformed the automotive industry,&lt;ref name="botmag"/&gt;&lt;ref name="move"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://electronicdesign.com/embedded/joseph-engelberger-robotics-move-industry-space-elder-care|title=Joseph Engelberger: Robotics Move From Industry To Space To Elder Care|first=Doris|last=Kilbane|date=December 1, 2008|accessdate=December 1, 2015|work=Electronic Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="robotics"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.robotics.org/content-detail.cfm/Industrial-Robotics-News/Joseph-F-Engelberger-Father-of-Robotics/content_id/5840|title=Joseph F.

In Japan, Engelberger was widely hailed as a key player in the postwar ascendancy of Japanese manufacturing quality and efficiency.&lt;ref name="angelo"/&gt;

In 1966, Engelberger and a Unimate robot appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. In the segment, the robot poured a beer, sank a golf putt, and directed the band.&lt;ref name="angelo"/&gt;

An early proponent of increased investment in robotic systems, Engelberger published articles and gave congressional testimony on the value of using automation in space long before the successes of [[NASA]]'s [[Exploration of Mars#NASA|Mars landers]], ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'', and other unmanned space science missions. He also consulted for NASA on the use of robotics in space exploration.&lt;ref name="move"/&gt;&lt;ref name="robotics"/&gt;

Unimation purchased [[Victor Scheinman]]'s Vicarm Inc. in 1977, and with Scheinman's help, the company created and began producing the [[Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly]], a new model of robotic arm, and using Scheinman's cutting-edge VAL programming language. However, the automotive companies that had been Unimation's earliest and most reliable clients began moving away from the use of hydraulically powered robotic arms in the early 1980s in favor of electric motors, a change that Engelberger vehemently opposed. Sales fell, and the company was acquired by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] in 1982 for [[United States dollar|$]]107 million.&lt;ref name="botmag"/&gt;&lt;ref name="keay"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://robohub.org/industrial-robotics-pioneer-joe-engelberger-turns-90/|agency=Robohub|title=Industrial robotics pioneer Joe Engelberger turns 90|last=Keay|first=Andra|date=July 26, 2015|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engelberger, who had served as Unimation's chief executive since its inception, left the company not long thereafter.&lt;ref name="henderson"/&gt;

===HelpMate===
After observing the help for his aging parents, Engelberger saw the robotics automations could be used in the medical field.&lt;ref&gt;http://electronicdesign.com/embedded/joseph-engelberger-robotics-move-industry-space-elder-care&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Engelberger founded Transitions Research Corporation. He introduced the HelpMate, a [[mobile robot]] hospital courier, as the flagship product of his new company. He hoped to kick-start a new industry for in-home robots, but he started in 1988 by selling his first HelpMate to [[Danbury Hospital]], located in [[Danbury, Connecticut|the same Connecticut city]] where his company was based. The medical robot was successful enough that the hospital ended up purchasing another, and within a decade, well over 100 hospitals worldwide operated HelpMates, whether purchased outright or rented from Engelberger's company, which he renamed HelpMate Robotics Inc.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://spinoff.nasa.gov/spinoff2003/hm_4.html|title=A Robot to Help Make the Rounds|date=2003|accessdate=December 1, 2015|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Engelberger was awarded the [[Japan Prize]] in 1997, Senator [[Joseph Lieberman]] of Connecticut delivered a floor speech in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in praise and recognition of the inventor, calling HelpMate Robotics "an example of the way that a patient federal investment in science and technology can lead to new products that employ Americans and make for a better quality of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://capitolwords.org/date/1997/05/23/S5144-3_joseph-engelberger-and-helpmate-robotics-inc/|title=Joseph Engelberger And Helpmate Robotics, Inc.|date=May 23, 1997|accessdate=December 1, 2015|agency=Capitolwords, a project of the Sunlight Foundation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20151220053201/http://capitolwords.org/date/1997/05/23/S5144-3_joseph-engelberger-and-helpmate-robotics-inc/|archivedate=December 20, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HelpMate was acquired by [[Cardinal Health]] in the late 1990s, a move Engelberger came to regret, complaining that the new owners moved away from his preferred model of renting out robots toward selling off used, depreciated models.&lt;ref name="move"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nocks"&gt;''The Robot: The Life Story of a Technology'' (2008) by Lisa Nocks {{ISBN|978-0801890710}}, pp. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
The 2000 World Automation Congress was dedicated to Engelberger, who delivered the [[keynote]] address.&lt;ref name="henderson"/&gt; Even after his departure from HelpMate and well into his 80s, he remained active in the promotion and development of robots for use in [[elder care]].&lt;ref name="keay"/&gt; He notably discouraged the notion of [[legged robot]]s, arguing that robots should use wheels for locomotion,&lt;ref name="spice"/&gt; although he supported the use of robotic arms to allow the machines to interact with their surroundings.&lt;ref name="move"/&gt;&lt;ref name="robotics"/&gt; He worked on developing a two-armed robot to act as a "servant-companion" to seniors with limited mobility.&lt;ref name="angelo"/&gt;

Engelberger died on December 1, 2015, in [[Newtown, Connecticut]],&lt;ref name="robotics"/&gt; a little more than four months after celebrating his 90th birthday.&lt;ref name="mmh"/&gt;

==Publications==
Engelberger published ''Robotics in Practice'' in 1980. The book became a classic in the field and has been translated into six languages. ''Robotics in Practice'' was followed by ''Robotics in Service'' in 1989.&lt;ref name="robotics"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Robotics in Service'' (1989) by Joseph F. Engelberger {{ISBN|978-0262525664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Engelberger was elected to the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in 1984. He was also honored among "The 1000 Makers of the 20st Century" by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in 1992.&lt;ref name="nocks"/&gt; Additional honors include the Progress Award of the [[Society of Manufacturing Engineers]],&lt;ref name="henderson"/&gt; the 1982 Nyselius Award from the American Die Casting Institution, the 1982 [[ASME Leonardo Da Vinci Award|Leonardo da Vinci Award]] of the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]], the 1982 American Machinist Award, the 1983 Golden Omega Award at the Electrical Electronics Insulation Conference,&lt;ref name="robotics1"/&gt; the 1983 McKechnie Award from the [[University of Liverpool]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=5867485|title=Financial Intranet, Inc.

==Legacy==
The [[Robotics Industries Association]] annually presents the Joseph F. Engelberger Awards to "persons who have contributed outstandingly to the furtherance of the science and practice of robotics." The award was first given in 1977.&lt;ref name="henderson"/&gt;

Engelberger's most famous co-invention, the [[Unimate]] industrial robotic arm, was among the first inductees into the [[Robot Hall of Fame]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="razor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spice"/&gt;

'''KrioRus''' ({{lang-ru|КриоРус}}) — the first Russian [[cryonics]] company, founded in 2005 as a project by a non-governmental organization ''Russian Transhumanist Movement''. KrioRus is the only cryonics company in Europe, that possesses its own cryostorage{{refn|group=note|name=history|{{See below|History}}}}. The company stores bodies (or brains) of its cryopatients — dead people and animals, in [[liquid nitrogen]], in the hope that someday it will be possible to revive them by means of the [[emerging technologies]] of the future{{refn|group=note|name=activities}}. The company offers a service of freezing either the entire patient's body, or just their head. KrioRus cooperates with other cryonics companies of the world, and facilitates placement of patients' bodies in similar storage facilities, situated outside Russia{{refn|group=note|name=activities}}.

Legally, the company has the status of a scientific research organization, engaged in a non-mainstream activity, and its services are not subject to certification. One of the problems with KrioRus activity is considered to be the lack of cryonics-related legislation. The company does not guarantee the revivification of its cryopatient{{refn|group=note|name=legal|{{See below|Legal aspects}}}}.

Criticism of company's activity consists of the criticism of cryonics per se: yet there is little scientific proof that supports the theory of reanimation and most mainstream scientists and doctors express great scepticism about the field. In comparison with foreign cryonics companies, and of the fact that KrioRus, as indeed the other cryonics companies, is not always capable of fulfilling contractual obligations{{refn|group=note|name=legal}}{{refn|group=note|name=activities|{{See below|Activities}}}}{{refn|group=note|name=criticism|{{See below|Criticism}}}}.

== History ==
First attempts at creating a Russian cryocompany were undertaken in the 1990s by physicist Mikhail Solovyev.&lt;ref name=trud /&gt;

Initial motivation of the founding was the desire of its nine founding members to freeze their own bodies as well as the bodies of their loved ones in order to be "resurrected" in future by means of some future medical technologies.&lt;ref name=trud /&gt;&lt;ref name=plus /&gt; Prior to the companys' founding, its prospective staff members have already had some experience in cryopreservation, when in 2003, Igor Artyukhov acted as the chief advisor to a project of preservation of the brain of one deceased biotech scientist.&lt;ref name=rbk /&gt;&lt;ref name=trup&gt;{{cite web|author=Анастасия Давыдкина, Татьяна Филимонова |url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1916405 |title=Упорный труп |publisher=[[Kommersant]] |language=ru |accessdate=2013-08-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230232/http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1916405 |archivedate=2016-03-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has been eventually established in 2005 as a project of an [[NGO]], called ''Russian Transhumanist Movement''. Lydia Fedorenko became the first patient of the company in 2005. However, at that time KrioRus did not yet possess a dedicated cryostorage, and prior to being preserved by the company, her family had for several months kept her brain on dry ice. During the existence of KrioRus, citizens from nine countries have become its patients, including citizens of the [[United States]], [[Netherlands]], [[Japan]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Australia]]. By the same token, cryopreserved relatives of company employees are being kept in cryostorage.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{Cite web|author=Weaver, Courtney |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d634e198-a435-11e5-873f-68411a84f346.html |title=''Inside the weird world of cryonics'' |publisher=[[Financial Times]] |date=2015-12-18 |accessdate=2016-08-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123205909/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d634e198-a435-11e5-873f-68411a84f346.html |archivedate=2016-01-23 |quote=alternative archive https://www.webcitation.org/6kfWp8nKI?url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d634e198-a435-11e5-873f-68411a84f346.html?siteedition%3Dintl |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trud /&gt;&lt;ref name=stat /&gt;&lt;ref name=elements /&gt;&lt;ref name=brain&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/science/2006/05/10_a_635428.shtml |title=Мозги отмороженные |language=ru |author=Алексей Паевский |publisher=[[Gazeta.ru]] |accessdate=2013-08-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914155012/http://www.gazeta.ru/science/2006/05/10_a_635428.shtml |archivedate=2012-09-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ria&gt;{{Cite web|author=Валерий Спиридонов |url=https://ria.ru/authors/20160609/1445170554.html |title=''Уйти в минус и выжить'' |publisher=[[RIA Novosti]] |language=ru |accessdate=2016-08-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820215828/http://ria.ru/authors/20160609/1445170554.html |archivedate=2016-08-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mk.ru/science/interview/2011/01/20/559472-15-rossiyan-otpravilis-v-buduschee.html |title=15 россиян отправились в будущее |language=ru |accessdate=2013-08-27 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Jdf5I3Cp?url=http://www.mk.ru/science/interview/2011/01/20/559472-15-rossiyan-otpravilis-v-buduschee.html |archivedate=2013-09-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that KrioRus has become, during the 2010-s, the third largest cryonics company in the world and now provides competition to companies such as [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation|Alcor]] (which has about 140 people in cryostorage).

Company representatives attitude to the possibility of "resurrection" is described by them as follows (in reply to the question: "Doesn't cryonics give false hope?"): "There is no concrete evidence as to whether the development of cryonics would end in is success or will it fail. But the fact that the concept of cryonics is currently dependent upon a yet unknown science of the future, and that its success cannot be guaranteed, it is not the same as its guaranteed failure ".&lt;ref name=i&gt;{{cite web|url=http://izvestia.ru/news/591553|title=Россияне заморозили рекордное количество кошек и собак|date=2015-09-17|language=ru|publisher=«[[Известия]]»|accessdate=2016-10-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914201952/http://izvestia.ru/news/591553|archivedate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key advantages KrioRus possesses is the cost of its services,&lt;ref name=daily /&gt; primarily for Russian and non-US citizens. Unlike American companies, KrioRus was founded in such a way, that it is not subject to the rules governing medical and funeral activities. As a result, the company does not face regulatory challenges in such fields of activity as acquisition of bodies from hospitals and morgues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Кортни Уивер |url=http://www.inopressa.ru/article/21dec2015/ft/cryonic.html |title=''В загадочном мире крионики'' |publisher=[[NEWSru]].com |language=ru |accessdate=2016-09-20 |date=2015-12-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326094734/http://www.inopressa.ru/article/21dec2015/ft/cryonic.html |archivedate=2016-03-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it matters that KrioRus has a cleaner reputation than Alcor, which has suffered a few scandals. Danila Medvedev describes this situation as follows: "We didn’t have the crisis that they had in the 1970s. People in Russia have no negative impression of cryonics".{{refn|group=note|name=neg|In the early 1980s, in [[California]] a cryocompany was lacking funds, necessary for the upkeep of cryopatients' bodies. There has been initiated a procedure, that involved transfer of patients' bodies from individual storage containers to group ones, a procedure during which two cryocontainers were damaged, and that led to nine bodies succumbing to decay.&lt;ref name=ft /&gt;&lt;ref name=daily&gt;{{Cite web|author=Courtney Weaver |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3384734/Inside-macabre-cold-store-price-pet-FROZEN-come-DEAD.html |title=''Inside the macabre cold store where, for a price you and your pet can be...

In the United States, as in Russia, cryonics companies employ largely the same cryopreservation procedures — after biological and legal death of the patient has been established, blood is evacuated from the body (and is replaced with a special solution, so prepared that its [[crystallization]] during the freezing process would not destroy the cells), the body is cooled down to the temperature of [[dry ice]] (-79&amp;nbsp;°C), transported and then cooled down to ultra low temperature (-196&amp;nbsp;°C) and placed in a long-term storage tank. Choices to preserve only the head occur not only due to financial considerations, but also because of the belief that in the future, technology would allow to restore the lost body, and the identity will be safeguarded in the brain.&lt;ref name=ft /&gt;&lt;ref name=elements /&gt;&lt;ref name=brain /&gt;&lt;ref name="rg" /&gt; One of the problems of cryonics is to provide for a quick patient admission, since the quicker this occurs, the better it is possible to preserve the body. To address this problem, the company has several mobile teams of specialists across the country, who can quickly go and provide patients with necessary primary procedures on the spot. Similarly, KrioRus is cooperating with regional doctors, and provides them with lessons in primary preparative procedures for cryopreservation.&lt;ref name=biz360&gt;{{Cite web|author=Коровина, Ольга |url=https://biz360.ru/materials/kontrakt-na-bessmertie/ |title=''Контракт на бессмертие'' |publisher=biz360.ru |language=ru |accessdate=2016-09-20 |date=2015-10-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920181127/https://biz360.ru/materials/kontrakt-na-bessmertie/ |archivedate=2016-09-20 |quote=alternative archive https://www.webcitation.org/6kfYEfYKc?url=https://biz360.ru/materials/kontrakt-na-bessmertie/ |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an additional service to complement its chief one, KrioRus offers help in safekeeping the lives' archives of their clients (blogs, video recordings), that should help to restore the identity of the person in the future.&lt;ref name=i /&gt;

[[File:Scottgroup.jpg|250px|thumb|18 January 1912. The last photo of Robert Scott's group.]]
One of the directions of company's development is the creation of cryostorage facilities in a neutral country such as Switzerland. This country is one of the primary target countries because it has allowed [[euthanasia]], with the help of which one can create better conditions for cryopreservation.&lt;ref name=bloomberg /&gt; Also, representatives of the company named one of the objectives the improvement of the cryopatient preparation and transportation procedures, which will enable the provision of cryonics services to customers from all over the world, including such countries as [[Ecuador]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name=ft /&gt;&lt;ref name=elements /&gt; Among other potential business activities of the company, was mentioned sperm freezing, as were freezing of embryos and organs, Cryobank creation, tours of cryostorage facilities, visiting relatives provided patients are stored in transparent sarcophagi, introduction of cryonics to the voluntary health insurance, etc.&lt;ref name=trup /&gt; Danila Medvedev calls it the Company's Dream — the opportunity to bring members of [[Robert Falcon Scott|Robert Scott]]'s doomed expedition, who froze to death in the Antarctic in 1912, to the KrioRus lab. According to Danila Medvedev, the temperature on that continent is low enough, and little enough time has passed since then, in order for it to be possible to safeguard the explorers and bring them back to life.&lt;ref name=daily /&gt;

KrioRus conducts its research in two laboratories — in [[Moscow]] and in [[Voronezh]]. This work is focused on improving the process of cryopreservation itself, e.g., to improve vitrification technology, or to develop an apparatus, permitting storage in a gaseous environment with the controlled supply of liquid nitrogen.&lt;ref name=rbk /&gt;&lt;ref name=elements /&gt;&lt;ref name=tanexpo /&gt; A separate scientific field of study is the reversible defrosting of organs.

When clients deal with KrioRus, they sign a contract to carry out scientific experiment on the preservation and revitalization of a human, and at the same time KrioRus demands that the customer acknowledges the fact that the contractor does not provide guarantees to revive the cryopatient.&lt;ref name=rbk /&gt;&lt;ref name=vc&gt;{{Cite web|author=Вадим Смыслов|url=https://vc.ru/p/cryonics|title=Замерзшие из Сергиева Посада: кто крионирует людей в России и в мире и сколько это стоит|publisher=vc.ru|date=2016-10-31|language=ru|accessdate=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement covers safekeeping of the bodies for up to 100 years, with the possibility of extension.&lt;ref name=metro /&gt;

Maria Bast, chairman of the Russian Lawyers Association for Human Rights, have said that the status of KrioRus as a scientific organisation is justified, and the problem stems from the lack of legislation in the field of cryonics.&lt;ref name=rbk /&gt; However, there is a precedent, when in 2005 in [[Novosibirsk]], the relatives of the deceased were keeping his body in a deep freeze and the state prosecutor did not find that it constituted a crime.&lt;ref name=brain /&gt;

According to the lawyer Svetlana Yudina, judging from a legal point of view, the company is involved in non-standard activities, but that does not necessarily mean that its employees are crooks. This is being justified as follows: "Activities, directed towards cryopreservation of people can be considered fraud if an employee makes assurances or promises that the frozen corpse would inevitably come to life under any circumstances, and even specifies the date or the period when such a miracle is to be expected. Similarly, it can be considered fraud if an employee is presenting falsified evidence of successful experiments, photos, videos of re-animated people, and so on. However if the workers simply argue that a revival is possible, but by means of methods that have not yet been invented, no deception is to be found there".&lt;ref name=rbk /&gt;

According to the [[Ministry of Health (Russia)|Health Ministry]] press service, cryonics companies' services are not subject to certification, since research is their chief activity.&lt;ref name=rbk /&gt;

In order for a person's body to be transferred postmortem to KrioRus, it is required that the individual in question would have stated in their will that their body should be handed over to the cryonics company, and in such a case, these works can not be prohibited by law. Otherwise, from a legal point of view one, is required to settle the problem with the client's next of kin.&lt;ref name=rbk /&gt; However, even with contract and with the will both being available one could run into problems (e.g., due to the "hostile wife" phenomenon{{refn|group=note|name=wife|The "marital animosity" or "hostile wife" phenomenon is a situation where hostile-minded spouses or girlfriends limit or end their partners' involvement in cyonics-related activities.&lt;ref name=mwn&gt;{{Cite web|author1=Michael G.

== Criticism ==

The company's activity is seen in the context of criticism of cryonics as such. At present, the question of the possibility of "resurrection" of cryopatient is an open one in scientific community. On one hand, there are no known cases of "resurrection" of cryopatients, and cryonics companies (KrioRus included&lt;ref name=rbk /&gt;) do not guarantee such an outcome. On the other hand, there are experimental arguments in favour of the hypothesis of a successful "resurrection". From theoretical and research perspectives there is a number of arguments both in favour of cryonics supporters and in favour of its opponents.

When comparing KrioRus and Alcor, journalists call the first company [[Lada]] of the world of cryonics, and the second one — [[Mercedes-Benz]]. Alcor cryonics is the largest cryonics company in the world, twice a week it conducts tours of its premises, demonstrating the operating room (where [[vitrification]] and freezing are conducted), as well as long-term cryopatients' storage facilities, where they could just be seen through [[bulletproof glass]]. On the other side, KrioRus does not offer any such services.&lt;ref name=ft /&gt;&lt;ref name=daily /&gt;

There is a known case of the "hostile wife" phenomenon in the practice of the company. In 2012, cancer patient, engineer Mikhail Voronin has signed a contract with the company KrioRus on neuropreservation and paid 300 thousand [[Russian ruble|rubles]]. However, after the death, engineer's body complete with the brain has been cremated, by the widow, who "stole" Mikhails' body from the hospital and did not allow it to come into possession of the company. Thus, the employees' KrioRus were not able to cryopreserve patient, despite the fact that he has stated his will in writing and even recorded a video missive. Later, the court rejected the company's plea.&lt;ref name="rg" /&gt;&lt;ref name=pr /&gt;

A '''line card''' or '''digital line card''' is a modular electronic circuit designed to fit on a separate [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) and interface with a [[telecommunications]] [[access network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/46105/line-card |title=line card Definition from PC Magazine Encyclopedia |publisher=Pcmag.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A line card typically interfaces the [[twisted pair]] cable of a [[plain old telephone service]] (POTS) [[local loop]] to the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN).  [[Telephone line]] cards perform multiple tasks, such as [[analog-to-digital converter|analog-to-digital]] and [[digital-to-analog converter|digital-to-analog]] conversion of voice, [[off-hook]] detection, ring supervision, line integrity tests, and other [[BORSCHT]] functions.  In some [[telephone exchange]] designs, the line cards generate [[ringing (telephony)|ringing]] current and decode [[DTMF]] signals.  The line card in a [[Subscriber Loop Carrier|subscriber loop carrier]] is called a subscriber line interface card (SLIC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cscprinters.com/line-card.html |title=Line Card |publisher=Cscprinters.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techtarget"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchitchannel.techtarget.com/definition/line-card |title=What is line card? - Definition from WhatIs.com |publisher=Searchitchannel.techtarget.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A line card can terminate a line supporting voice [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] service, [[ISDN]] service, [[DSL]] service, or proprietary ones. Some line cards are capable of terminating more than one type of service.&lt;ref name="techtarget" /&gt;

Since an access [[network element]] is usually intended to interface many users (typically a few thousand), some exchanges have multiple line terminations per card. Likewise, one [[network element]] can have  many line cards.

'''Oscar''' is an [[Black cat|all black]] [[cat]] owned by Kate Allan and Mike Nolan who lives on the [[Channel Islands|Channel Island]] of [[Jersey]]. In 2009 Oscar had both hind paws severed by a [[combine harvester]]. Since then he has undergone a pioneering operation to add prosthetic feet. The treatment has since been considered for use with humans. A book about Oscar's story, ''Oscar the Bionic Cat'' was published in 2013. 

==Accident==
In October 2009, at the age of two and a half years, Oscar had both the paws of his hind legs severed by a [[combine harvester]] while in a maize field near his home in Jersey.&lt;ref name="BBC Jersey"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/jersey/hi/people_and_places/nature/newsid_8762000/8762217.stm|title=A cat from Jersey has shot to fame as the 'bionic cat'|last=Morrison|first=Ryan|work=[[BBC Online]]|publisher=BBC Jersey|accessdate=26 June 2010 | date=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iXq2jSNiRynLRPRPoWCDa5w3DPhAD9GIFGMO0|title=Bionic British cat gets faux paws|last=Cheng|first=Maria|work=[[Google Search]]|publisher=The Associated Press|accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legs were cut between the ankle and the foot.&lt;ref name="itimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0625/breaking32.html?via=mr|title=Laois surgeon helps amputee cat|date=June 25, 2010|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oscar was later found by a passing cyclist&lt;ref name="BBC Jersey" /&gt; who then brought Oscar to his owners' home.

==Treatment==

=== Initial treatment===
Peter Haworth, a vet at the New Era Veterinary Hospital in Jersey, dressed Oscar's wounds and administered cat painkillers making him comfortable within minutes.&lt;ref name="BBC Jersey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/cat-prosthetic-legs/story?id=11013333&amp;page=1|title=Oscar the Cat Gets Two Prosthetic Legs|last=Gallego|first=Sonia|work=ABC News|accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haworth then referred Allan and Nolan to the [[Surrey]]-based neuro-orthopaedic surgeon [[Noel Fitzpatrick]].&lt;ref name="BBC Jersey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="itimes" /&gt; There was a lot of communication between the Irish surgeon and the Jersey owners. After looking at [[Radiography|x-ray]]s and pictures Fitzpatrick decided Oscar would be an ideal patient partly due to his young age.&lt;ref name="BBC Jersey" /&gt; Oscar was then flown to the United Kingdom mainland  by air cargo although he had to stay in his box for eight hours during the journey.&lt;ref name="BBC Jersey" /&gt;

===New feet===
Oscar's owners did a lot of "soul-searching" before deciding to go ahead with the operation.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/25/oscar-cat-artifical-paws-pioneering-surgery|title=Paws for thought: pioneering surgery puts cat back on his feet|last=Jones|first=Sam|date=25 June 2010|work=The Guardian|accessdate=26 June 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kate Allan later said that the cause for her uncertainty was that the kind of operation planned had never been done before.&lt;ref name="BBC Jersey" /&gt; Although the operation carried out by Noel Fitzpatrick was a world first, it mimics a natural process, being similar to the way deer grow antler bones, in the manner that the implants grow through the skin.&lt;ref name="BBC Jersey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; The implants were both custom-made to fit into holes drilled into Oscar's ankle bones.&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="YT2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Won5dmGUVkY&amp;feature=related|title= Oscar the 'Bionic Cat' (including an interview with Fitzpatrick)|date=30 June 2010|work=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=2 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are known as intraosseous transcutaneous amputation prosthetics (ITAPs) and were developed by Professor Gordon Blunn and Dr. Catherine Pendegrass of [[University College London]]'s Centre for Biomedical Engineering.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/science_and_environment/10404251.stm|title=Bionic feet for amputee cat|date=25 June 2010|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a honeycomb structure which enables skin to bond with the implant to prevent infection.&lt;ref name="hs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/world/oscar-becomes-worlds-first-bionic-cat-after-farm-accident/story-e6frf7lf-1225884599089|title=Oscar becomes world's first bionic cat after farm accident|date=June 26, 2010|work=Herald Sun|accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implants are placed into the drilled holes which then allow for a "sock" to be fitted over them.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

The ITAP technology is currently being tested on humans and a prosthetic has been made for a woman injured in the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|July 2005 London bombings]].&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Fitzpatrick has said he would welcome a collaborative approach with &lt;!--As opposed to Elephant surgeons who can't hold the scalpel too well? human surgeons --&gt;other surgeons working on human amputations.&lt;ref name="hs" /&gt;

===Snapped prosthesis===
In August 2012, as a result of a reoccurring infection in Oscar's right ankle, the ITAP snapped at the point where the titanium rod exits his stump.  Peter Haworth of New Era Veterinary Hospital, Jersey, once again made Oscar comfortable while possible treatment options were explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Kate|title=Oscar: The Bionic Cat: A heart-warming tale of feline bravery|date=2013|publisher=Summersdale}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oscar returned to [[Noel Fitzpatrick#Fitzpatrick Referrals|Fitzpatrick Referrals]] in 2013 where veterinary surgeon [[Noel Fitzpatrick]] performed a 2-hour operation to implant a Perfits (Percutaneous Fixation to Skeleton) amputation endoprosthesis directly into Oscar's shinbone.  A new exoprosthesis – or foot – needed to be developed for Oscar, as the removal of his ankle meant he could no longer wear a blade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fitzpatrick Referrals|title=Oscar|url=http://www.fitzpatrickreferrals.co.uk/the-supervet/series-1/episode-1/oscar|accessdate=28 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228221030/http://www.fitzpatrickreferrals.co.uk/the-supervet/series-1/episode-1/oscar|archivedate=28 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==

===''The Bionic Vet''===
''[[The Bionic Vet]]'' is a [[BBC]] documentary following the work of Fitzpatrick which aired on BBC1 on 30 June 2010.&lt;ref name="BBC Jersey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hs" /&gt;  The programme showed Oscar walking with prototype feet made for him by engineers at [[Salford University]].  Footage not shown on the programme of Oscar with a later set of better-designed feet was uploaded on to YouTube on 18 June 2010.&lt;ref name="YT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmDqVN7vr8E|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414054523/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmDqVN7vr8E|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 April 2016|title= Oscar the bionic cat|date=18 June 2010|work=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An update video with the vet involved showed Oscar's new feet and explained how they are designed to snap at a break point on the 'blade' rather than within the foot if he gets into difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fitzpatrickreferrals.co.uk/news/oscar-update-video-bionic-cat-gets-new-feet&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Supervet''===
An update on Oscar's progress was given in the [[Channel 4]] television series ''[[The Supervet]]''.  The television series follows the work of veterinary surgeon [[Noel Fitzpatrick]] and his practice Fitzpatrick Referrals.  In Episode 1, broadcast on 7 May 2014, Vet Noel Fitzpatrick was shown fitting Oscar with his new foot following his recent surgery to replace the snapped ITAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=IMDb|title=The Supervet (TV series)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3713822/|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guinness World Records==
Oscar holds two [[Guinness World Records]], one for being the first animal with two bionic leg implants, and the other for being the first animal to receive implants into its moving joints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Warren|first1=Jane|title=Oscar the bionic cat|url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/books/382627/Oscar-the-bionic-cat|accessdate=28 December 2014|agency=Sunday Express|date=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phiwa Nkambule''' (born January 24, 1992) is an [[internet entrepreneur]] best known for co-founding and leading [[Riovic]] as its [[chief executive officer]].&lt;ref name=forbesafrica&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbesafrica.com/30-under-30/2018/06/04/under-30-technology/|title=Under 30 Technology - Forbes Africa|date=4 June 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Phiwa Nkambule was born in [[Manzini, Swaziland|Manzini]] where he also spent his childhood.&lt;ref name=PR20180503&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/swaziland/swazi-observer/20180503/281990378145647|title=Eswatini Born Entrepreneur Develops FinTech Platform|date=3 May 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=observer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.observer.org.sz/details.php?id=5348|title=First Liswati Makes it to Forbes List|website=new.observer.org.sz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, as a 14-year-old, he began fixing and building computers with his uncle in a small township in Swaziland.&lt;ref name=forbesafrica/&gt; Nkambule moved to South Africa in 2007 for academic purposes.&lt;ref name=PR20160709&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/swaziland/observer-on-saturday/20160709/281805693258766|title=Swazi Born Entrepreneur Making Waves in SA Insurance Industry|date=9 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phiwa was a [[law student]] at the [[University of Pretoria]] before quitting to start his first technology company [[Cybatar]] from his garage in 2014.&lt;ref name=themoneyfam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themoneyfam.com/fintech-entrepreneur-peer-investing/|title=Why this 25 Year Old Fintech Entrepreneur Thinks Your Peers are Your Biggest Investments|date=18 May 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at the university where he taught himself web and app development.&lt;ref name=forbesafrica/&gt;

==Entrepreneurship==

Before leaving the [[University of Pretoria]] Phiwa attempted to work with the Swaziland National Library and the Manzini Regional Education Office in 2013 but was rejected.&lt;ref name=PR20180606&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/swaziland/swazi-observer/20180606/281625305995026|title=Forbes listed Liswati rejected by his own country|date=6 June 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After dropping out of university in 2014 Nkambule founded [[Cybatar]], a technology company focused on fuel delivery from his garage in [[Pretoria]], South Africa.&lt;ref name=forbesafrica/&gt;&lt;ref name=itweb1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.itweb.co.za/content/lP3gQ2MG2mw7nRD1|title=SA start-up uses crowdfunding for insurance|first=ITWeb, Paula|last=Gilbert|date=13 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=howwemadeitinafrica&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/swaziland-born-entrepreneur-introduces-crowdfunded-insurance/54932/|title=Swaziland-born entrepreneur introduces crowdfunded insurance|date=1 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an isolated sample, where the macroscopic flow of an electric current is prohibited, the fast carriers (often the electrons) are slowed down and the slow carriers (often the holes) are accelerated by an electric field, called the Dember field.

One of the main applications of the photo–Dember effect is the generation of [[terahertz radiation|terahertz (THz) radiation]] pulses for [[terahertz time-domain spectroscopy]]. This effect is present in most semiconductors but it is particularly strong in [[narrow-gap semiconductor]]s (mainly [[arsenide]]s and [[antimonide]]s) such as [[indium arsenide|InAs]]&lt;ref name=a2/&gt;&lt;ref name=a3/&gt; and [[indium antimonide|InSb]]&lt;ref name=a4/&gt; owing to their high [[electron mobility]]. The photo–Dember terahertz emission should not be confused with the surface [[field emission]], which occurs if the surface [[energy band]]s of a [[semiconductor]] fall between its [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] and [[electrical conduction|conduction]] bands, which produces a phenomenon known as [[Fermi level pinning]], causing, at its time, [[band bending]] and consequently the formation of a [[depletion region|depletion]] or accumulation layer close to the surface which contributes to the [[acceleration]] of [[charge carriers]].&lt;ref name=a2/&gt; These two effects can contribute constructively or destructively for the [[dipole]] formation depending on the direction of the band-bending.

In [[automatic control]], a '''regulator''' is a device which has the function of maintaining a designated characteristic. It performs the activity of managing or maintaining a range of values in a machine. The measurable property of a device is managed closely by specified conditions or an advance set value; or it can be a variable according to a predetermined arrangement scheme. It can be used generally to connote any set of various controls or devices for regulating or controlling items or objects.

Examples are a [[voltage regulator]] (which can be a [[transformer]] whose voltage ratio of transformation can be adjusted, or an [[electronic circuit]] that produces a defined voltage), a [[pressure regulator]], such as a [[diving regulator]], which maintains its output at a fixed pressure lower than its input, and a fuel regulator (which controls the supply of fuel).

Regulators can be designed to control anything from gases or fluids, to light or electricity. Speed can be regulated by electronic, mechanical, or [[Electromechanics|electro-mechanical]] means. Such instances include; 
* Electronic regulators as used in modern railway sets where the voltage is raised or lowered to control the speed of the engine
* Mechanical systems such as [[valves]] as used in fluid control systems. Purely mechanical pre-automotive systems included such designs as the [[Centrifugal governor|Watt centrifugal governor]] whereas modern systems may have electronic fluid speed sensing components directing [[solenoids]] to set the valve to the desired rate.
* Complex electro-mechanical speed control systems used to maintain speeds in modern cars ([[cruise control]]) - often including hydraulic components, 
* An aircraft engine's [[constant speed unit]] changes the propellor pitch to maintain engine speed.

'''Roentgen stereophotogrammetry''' ('''RSA''') is a highly accurate technique for the assessment of three-dimensional migration and micromotion of a [[joint replacement]] prosthesis relative to the bone it is attached to. It was introduced in 1974 by Goran Selvic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Several studies have found implant migration to be predictive of long-term implant survival and, for most devices, measurement over 2 years might therefore provide a surrogate outcome measure with relatively low numbers of subjects, e.g. from 15 to 25 patients in each group in randomized studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Because of this, RSA is an important technique in early [[clinical trials]] for screening new joint replacement prostheses.

==Methodology==
To achieve the high accuracy, the following steps are carried out: Small [[radio opaque]] markers are introduced in the bone and attached to the prosthesis to serve as well-defined artificial landmarks. Two synchronised [[x-ray]] foci are used to obtain a stereo image of the bone and the prosthesis. The positions of the foci are assessed using a calibration object that holds [[tantalum]] markers at accurately known positions. The coordinates of the bone and prosthesis markers are accurately measured and the [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional position]] of the markers is reconstructed using software. The change in the position ([[Translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]) of the prosthesis markers relative to the bone markers is then determined. The reported accuracy of RSA ranges between 0.05 and 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm for translations and between 0.15˚ and 1.15˚ for rotations (95% [[confidence interval]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''SECU-3'''&lt;ref&gt;http://SECU-3.org&lt;/ref&gt; is an internal combustion engine control unit. Open source project (drawings, schematic diagrams, source code etc. are open). Anyone can take part in the project and can access all information without registration.

Device controls the ignition, fuel injection and various other actuators of the internal combustion engine ([[internal combustion engine|ICE]]) and vehicle. In particular, it is capable of controlling the carburetor's choke using a stepper motor (auto choke), thus controlling RPM when engine is warming up. Manages [[Air–fuel ratio|AFR]] on the [[carburetor]] (like AXTEC AFR systems), idle cut off and power valve on carburetor, electric fuel pump, stepper gas valve with oxygen sensor loopback etc. Unique opportunities for reassigning the I/O functions. Smooth speed control of the cooling fan motor. The ability to edit the main settings and maps in real time (when engine is running) and switching between 2 or 4 sets of maps. And other features and functions (see below).

Currently, there are five modifications of the unit:
# SECU-3. The first version of the unit developed in 2007, controls ignition, cooling fan and some other functions. In the latest software releases, support for this unit has stopped. History of the SECU-3 versions with photos is [http://secu-3.org/bolshe-foto here]
# SECU-3T.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Electronic control unit for internal combustion engine SECU-3|author=Shabelnikov, A.A.|publisher=''[[Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute]]''|year=2015|journal=Visnik Nacional'nogo tehnichnogo universitetu «HPI» |volume=156 |pages=90–95 |issue=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can control the ignition and fuel injection. It does not contain built-in power drivers for ignition coils, fuel injectors and idling air control (IAC) valve. It is necessary to use external drivers.
# SECU-3L.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Ignition control system for internal combustion engines SECU-3L (Lite)|author=Shabelnikov, A.A.|publisher=''[[Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute]]''|year=2015|journal=BULLETIN OF THE NATIONAL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY “KHARKIV POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE” Series: "New solutions in modern technologies"|volume=155 |pages=115–121 |issue=46 (1155) 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It designed for ignition control only and it can be viewed as a lightweight version of the SECU-3T unit.

== History ==
The first version of SECU-3 was launched in October 2007 and successfully works on the author's ([https://github.com/ashabelnikov A.Shabelnikov]) vehicle for now.
Since then, the project has received a lot of new features and synchronization methods. First discussing of the project was started in 2007 in one topic on the iXBT conference.&lt;ref&gt;http://forum.ixbt.com/topic.cgi?id=48:5576&lt;/ref&gt; Since Dec. 2010 discussion moved to the forum on diyefi.org.&lt;ref&gt;http://forum.diyefi.org/viewforum.php?f=47&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 own project's forum had been opened.&lt;ref&gt;http://SECU-3.org/forum&lt;/ref&gt;
The system has evolved from the ignition control to the engine management system ([[Electronic Control Unit|ECU]]). The project is supported by author all the time.

== Current status ==
Continue to develop and extend fuel injection features and algorithms (inter alia, full-sequential injection support). Also, author works on software for the SECU-3i unit.

Features of the current firmware related to fuel injection:
* Simultaneous (all injectors open at the same time), central (throttle-body) injection, two banks alternating (two injectors or two banks of injectors fire alternately) and semi-sequential injection (injectors fire by pairs). In the nearest future full-sequential injection support will be added
* Speed-density method of estimating airflow into an engine (MAP and IAT sensors are used)
* Open-loop IAC (closed-loop algorithm ([[PID controller|PID]]) will be implemented in the nearest future)
* Closed loop control of AFR using oxygen sensor. Ability to set voltage threshold, integrator step etc.
* Tables: VE, AFR, inj.open time, warm up enrichment, IAC position on cranking, IAC position vs coolant temperature, inj.time on cranking, inj.timing

The '''Snow White design language''' is an [[design language|industrial design language]] which was developed by [[Hartmut Esslinger]]'s [[Frog Design Inc.|Frog Design]]. Used by [[Apple Computer]] from 1984 to 1990, the scheme has vertical and horizontal [[wikt:stripe|stripe]]s for decoration, [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]], and the [[optical illusion|illusion]] that the computer enclosure is smaller than it actually is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Esslinger|first=Hartmut|title=Keep It Simple|url=http://designmind.frogdesign.com/blog/snow-white-steve-jobs-and-apples-awakening-as-a-global-design-leader.html|work=designmind.frogdesign.com/|accessdate=21 January 2014|date=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bidgoli&gt;{{cite book|last=Bidgoli|first=Hossein|title=The Handbook of Technology Management: Supply Chain Management, Marketing and Advertising, and Global Management|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=[[Hoboken, New Jersey]]|isbn=978-0470249482|page=314|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EKNoKQ1L4CoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+handbook+of+technology+management&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=67veUqyWLsmusATu_YHwAg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20handbook%20of%20technology%20management&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design language boosted Apple’s global reputation, set design trends for the computer industry, and molded the perception of computers in the manufacturing and business world.&lt;ref name=Kahney&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahney|first=Leander|title=Inside Steve's Brain: Business Lessons from Steve Jobs, the Man Who Saved Apple|year=2008|publisher=Atlantic Books Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-1-848-87784-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=390ISyA-CUEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inside+steve%27s+brain&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dLneUs6APbDgsAT_rYD4Dg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=inside%20steve's%20brain&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other design features, Esslinger's presentation of the Apple logo&amp;mdash;a three-dimensional logo inlaid into the product case with the product name printed onto its surface&amp;mdash;was included on nearly every product for several years.

==History==
In 1982, Apple officials looked outside the company and indeed the country for a designer who could help them establish the firm as a world-class company.

Snow White refers to the seven projects code-named after the Seven Dwarves on which the new design language was to be applied. Several designers were courted by Apple under the Snow White project to see what they would come up with for the seven products (of which there were actually eight). The winner ultimately was Esslinger and the resulting style assumed the project’s code name.&lt;ref name="Kunkel"&gt;Kunkel, Paul. AppleDesign: The work of the Apple Industrial Design Group, with photographs by Rick English. New York: Graphis, 1997, p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Apple IIc]] computer, and its peripherals, were the first Snow White design.

Initially, Snow White debuted in a creamy [[Cream (color)|off-white]] color known at Apple as "Fog"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landsnail.com/apple/local/design/apple2c.html History of computer design: Apple IIc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but later other products moved to the warm gray "Platinum" color, lighter than the previous Apple "[[Beige box|Putty]]" color, used throughout the Apple product line from 1987 on. Esslinger favored a bright-white color originally for the IIc, but [[Jerry Manock]] successfully argued that it would attract fingerprints. Nevertheless, Esslinger detested the original Apple beige color and insisted all Snow White-styled products use the same off-white color as the IIc. Until the change to Platinum, no Snow White designs appeared in any other color, except for the [[Hard Disk 20SC]] in order to better match the beige color of the [[Macintosh Plus]] beneath which it was designed to sit.

Beginning in 1990, the [[Apple Industrial Design Group]] gradually altered and phased out the use of the Snow White language.

==Design features==

[[Image:Macintosh IIx.jpg|thumb|Macintosh IIx]]
[[File:Macintosh Portable-IMG 7541.jpg|thumb|Macintosh Portable]]

The distinguishing characteristics originated by the '''Snow White''' design language, in contrast to the original Apple industrial design style, include the following:

*minimal surface texturing
*colored a light off-white (Fog) or light gray (Platinum)
*inlaid three-dimensional Apple logo, diamond cut to the exact shape
*zero-draft enclosures, with no variances in case thickness and perpendicular walls
*recessed international port identification icons
*silk-screened product name badging
*shallow horizontal and vertical lines, 2&amp;nbsp;mm wide, 2&amp;nbsp;mm deep, spaced 10&amp;nbsp;mm apart on center, which run along any and all of the surfaces of the product, some of which act as vents and set back 30&amp;nbsp;mm from the front and 4&amp;nbsp;mm from the back
*Fog products have beige accents and cables, Platinum products have uniform color (no accents) and Smoke gray cables
*3&amp;nbsp;mm radius, rear and 2&amp;nbsp;mm radius, front corners
*simple unadorned ports and slots

Any or all of these features indicate a Snow White Frog Design influence over an otherwise Apple-designed product. In particular the first official implementation, the [[Apple IIc]], does not represent the complete set of design elements, while the [[Macintosh II]] includes all of them. Later, the [[Macintosh LC]] began to phase out some of the design elements.

:'''a:^'''{{note_label|SnowWhite|a|1}} {{note label|SnowWhite|a|2}} {{note label|SnowWhite|a|3}}While the IIc generally gets credit for being the first Apple computer released in the Snow White design language, it was not a “pure” example. Rob Gemmel (who was instrumental in soliciting Esslinger) had designed the IIc a year earlier and unbeknownst to him, Frog Design was working on their own design. In the end it was a compromise of Gemmel’s original design and Frog Design’s modifications. Likewise, the Macintosh SE was essentially Manock and Oyama’s design updated with Snow White details. The IIgs, which introduced Platinum gray, also evidenced the legacy design of the original Apple II case, in particular Manock’s wedge-shape. It wasn’t until the Macintosh II when Frog Design finally had a clean slate on which to design from the ground up, that the first pure example of pure Snow White was realized.

:'''c:^'''{{note_label|Fog|c|1}} {{note label|Fog|c|2}} {{note label|Fog|c|3}}Off-white “Fog” only

:'''d:^'''{{note_label|Beige|d|1}} Introduced simultaneously in both Apple/Macintosh beige and “Platinum” gray to better match the beige [[Macintosh Plus]] for which it was designed to sit beneath as well as conform to the Apple IIgs color scheme released at the same time. This would be the only Snow White product to intentionally use the original beige color for the purpose of matching existing products.

:'''e:^'''{{note_label|Cable|e|1}} All Apple connectors and cables began a transition to beige in 1985, however, certain Macintosh peripheral cables (e.g. mice and disk drives), despite adopting the new connector style, retained their medium-brown appearance until the transition to Platinum in 1987, at which time all cables became a dark gray color Apple called “Smoke.”

:'''f:^'''{{note_label|Accent|f|1}} Though technically beige, like the connectors &amp; cables, the Mouse IIc is considered to be colored as a Fog co-ordinated accent. It is definitely a ''Snow White'' design, which elements form the basis for the subsequent [[Apple Mouse#Apple Desktop Bus Mouse (G5431/A9M0331)|Apple Desktop Bus Mouse]]. It was not produced in Platinum.

Most [[Apple Displays]] introduced between 1984 and 1994 also used Snow White, except those specifically designed to match the [[Apple II]] series.

All [[Apple Keyboard#Apple Desktop Bus Keyboard (A9M0330)|Apple ADB keyboards]] and [[Apple Mouse#Apple Desktop Bus Mouse (G5431/A9M0331)|mice]] introduced between 1986 and 1993 were Snow White designs.

*The [[Apple Lisa|Lisa 2]]/[[Macintosh XL]] (1984) had Snow White stripes added to the front bezel redesign along with the inlaid Apple badging four months before the Apple IIc was introduced, technically making it the first Snow White product.
*The [[Apple Modem 300/1200]] (1985) was updated from Apple beige to Fog and the inlaid Apple badging was added.
*The [[Macintosh Plus]] (1986) was updated by Frog Design, but only added the inlaid Apple badging and recessed connector icons.
*The [[Macintosh External Disk Drive#Macintosh 800K External Drive|Macintosh 800K External Drive]] (1986) only included the inlaid Apple badging and simple floppy disk slot styling as well as the 2 and 3&amp;nbsp;mm radius corners and zero-draft enclosure.
*The [[Macintosh IIcx]] (1989) was designed in-house entirely by Apple and, though drawing upon the Snow White corporate language, departed considerably from the guidelines. This was the beginning of Apple’s efforts to break ties with Frog Design and rebuild the Industrial Design Group.
*The [[Macintosh IIci]] (1989) basically the same case as the IIcx with different internal hardware.

Both the 100- and 200-series PowerBooks and accessories were intended to tie into the rest of the Apple desktop products using the corporate Snow White design language. However, the light colors and decorative recessed lines did not seem appropriate for the scaled-down designs. In addition to adopting the darker grey color scheme which co-ordinated with the official corporate look, they also adopted a raised series of ridges mimicking the indented lines on the desktops. These early PowerBooks would be the last to use the aging Snow White look and the only ones to make such a radical adaptation of it.&lt;ref name="Kunkel"/&gt;

A '''speedometer''' or a speed meter is a [[gauge (instrument)|gauge]] that measures and displays the instantaneous [[speed]] of a vehicle. Now universally fitted to [[motor vehicle]]s, they started to be available as options in the 1900s, and as standard equipment from about 1910 onwards.&lt;ref name="hsw"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/speedometer.htm |title=How Speedometers Work |first=William |last=Harris |date=10 July 2007 |publisher=How stuff works |accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speedometers for other vehicles have specific names and use other means of sensing speed. For a boat, this is a [[pit log]]. For an aircraft, this is an [[airspeed indicator]].

[[Charles Babbage]] is credited with creating an early type of a speedometer, which was usually fitted to [[locomotive]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/newmyths.com/nmwebsite/non_fiction/charles-babbage-and-the-difference-engine|title=Charles Babbage and the Difference Engine - NewMyths.com|work=google.com|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://udini.proquest.com/topic/charles-babbage/|title=Udini → Flow|work=proquest.com|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electric speedometer was invented by the [[Croatia]]n [[Josip Belušić]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sobey |first=Ed |year=2009 |title=A Field Guide to Automotive Technology |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7GMrH4nRhcAC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=speedometer+invented |page=78 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=9781556528125 |accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1888 and was originally called a velocimeter.

== Operation ==

Originally patented by Otto Schultze on October 7, 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://w1.siemens.com/press/en/pp_cc/2005/04_apr/sosep200501_10_(special200504)_1264810.htm |title=Speedometer |publisher=Siemens |date=26 April 2005| accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it uses a rotating [[Flexible shaft|flexible cable]] usually driven by gearing linked to the output of the vehicle's [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]. The early Volkswagen Beetle and many motorcycles, however, use a cable driven from a front wheel.

When the vehicle is in motion, a speedometer gear assembly turns a speedometer cable, which then turns the speedometer mechanism itself. A small permanent magnet affixed to the speedometer cable interacts with a small aluminum cup (called a ''speedcup'') attached to the shaft of the pointer on the analogue speedometer instrument. As the magnet rotates near the cup, the changing magnetic field produces eddy currents in the cup, which themselves produce another magnetic field. The effect is that the magnet exerts a [[torque]] on the cup, "dragging" it, and thus the speedometer pointer, in the direction of its rotation with no mechanical connection between them.&lt;ref name="hsw"/&gt;

The pointer shaft is held toward zero by a fine [[torsion spring]]. The torque on the cup increases with the speed of rotation of the magnet. Thus an increase in the speed of the car will twist the cup and speedometer pointer against the spring. The cup and pointer will turn until the torque of the eddy currents on the cup are balanced by the opposing torque of the spring, and then stop. Given the torque on the cup is proportional to the car's speed, and the spring's deflection is proportional to the torque, the angle of the pointer is also proportional to the speed, so that equally spaced markers on the dial can be used for gaps in speed. At a given speed, the pointer will remain motionless and pointing to the appropriate number on the speedometer's dial.

The return spring is [[calibration|calibrated]] such that a given revolution speed of the cable corresponds to a specific speed indication on the speedometer. This calibration must take into account several factors, including ratios of the tailshaft gears that drive the flexible cable, the final drive ratio in the [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], and the diameter of the driven [[tires]].

One of the key disadvantages of the eddy current speedometer is that it cannot show the vehicle speed when running in reverse gear since the cup would turn in the opposite direction - in this scenario the needle would be driven against its mechanical stop pin on the zero position.

===Electronic===
{{see also|Vehicle speed sensor}}
Many modern speedometers are [[electronics|electronic]]. In designs derived from earlier eddy-current models, a rotation sensor mounted in the transmission delivers a series of electronic pulses whose frequency corresponds to the (average) rotational speed of the [[drive shaft|driveshaft]], and therefore the vehicle's speed, assuming the wheels have full traction. The sensor is typically a set of one or more magnets mounted on the output shaft or (in transaxles) differential crownwheel, or a toothed metal disk positioned between a magnet and a [[Hall effect|magnetic field sensor]]. As the part in question turns, the magnets or teeth pass beneath the sensor, each time producing a pulse in the sensor as they affect the strength of the magnetic field it is measuring.&lt;ref name="hsw"/&gt; Alternatively,particularly in vehicles with multiplex wiring, some manufacturers use the pulses coming from the ABS wheel sensors which communicate to the instrument panel via the [[CAN Bus]].  Most modern electronic speedometers have the additional ability over the eddy current type to show the vehicle speed when moving in reverse gear.

A computer converts the pulses to a speed and displays this speed on an electronically controlled, analog-style needle or a [[digital display]]. Pulse information is also used for a variety of other purposes by the [[Engine Control Unit|ECU]] or full-vehicle control system, e.g. triggering ABS or traction control, calculating average trip speed, or to increment the [[odometer]] in place of it being turned directly by the speedometer cable.

Another early form of electronic speedometer relies upon the interaction between a precision watch mechanism and a mechanical pulsator driven by the car's wheel or transmission. The watch mechanism endeavors to push the speedometer pointer toward zero, while the vehicle-driven pulsator tries to push it toward infinity. The position of the speedometer pointer reflects the relative magnitudes of the outputs of the two mechanisms.

==== Bicycle speedometers ====
{{main|Cyclocomputer}}
Typical [[bicycle]] speedometers measure the time between each wheel revolution, and give a readout on a small, handlebar-mounted digital display. The sensor is mounted on the bike at a fixed location, pulsing when the spoke-mounted magnet passes by. In this way, it is analogous to an electronic car speedometer using pulses from an ABS sensor, but with a much cruder time/distance resolution - typically one pulse/display update per revolution, or as seldom as once every 2–3 seconds at low speed with a 26-inch (2.07m circumference, without tire) wheel. However, this is rarely a critical problem, and the system provides frequent updates at higher road speeds where the information is of more importance. The low pulse frequency also has little impact on measurement accuracy, as these digital devices can be programmed by wheel size, or additionally by wheel or tire circumference in order to make distance measurements more accurate and precise than a typical motor vehicle gauge. However these devices carry some minor disadvantage in requiring power from batteries that must be replaced every so often in the receiver (AND sensor, for wireless models), and, in wired models, the signal being carried by a thin cable that is much less robust than that used for brakes, gears, or cabled speedometers.

Other, usually older bicycle speedometers are cable driven from one or other wheel, as in the motorcycle speedometers described above. These do not require battery power, but can be relatively bulky and heavy, and may be less accurate. The turning force at the wheel may be provided either from a gearing system at the hub (making use of the presence of e.g. a hub brake, cylinder gear or dynamo) as per a typical motorcycle, or with a friction wheel device that pushes against the outer edge of the rim (same position as rim brakes, but on the opposite edge of the fork) or the sidewall of the tyre itself. The former type are quite reliable and low maintenance but need a gauge and hub gearing properly matched to the rim and tyre size, whereas the latter require little or no calibration for a moderately accurate readout (with standard tyres, the "distance" covered in each wheel rotation by a friction wheel set against the rim should scale fairly linearly with wheel size, almost as if it were rolling along the ground itself) but are unsuitable for off-road use, and must be kept properly tensioned and clean of road dirt to avoid slipping or jamming.

== Error ==
Most speedometers have tolerances of some ±10%, mainly due to variations in tire diameter.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Sources of error due to tire diameter variations are wear, temperature, pressure, vehicle load, and nominal tire size. Vehicle manufacturers usually calibrate speedometers to read high by an amount equal to the average error, to ensure that their speedometers never indicate a lower speed than the actual speed of the vehicle, to ensure they are not liable for drivers violating speed limits.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Excessive speedometer error after manufacture can come from several causes but most commonly is due to nonstandard tire diameter, in which case the error is

&lt;math&gt; \mbox {Percentage error} = 100\times(1-\mbox{new diameter} / \mbox{standard diameter}) &lt;/math&gt;

Nearly all tires now have their size shown as "T/A_W" on the side of the tire (See: [[Tire code]]), and the tire's

&lt;math&gt; \mbox {Diameter in millimetres} = 2 \times T \times A / 100 + W \times 25.4 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \mbox {Diameter in inches} = T \times A / 1270 + W &lt;/math&gt;

For example, a standard tire is "185/70R14" with diameter = 2*185*(70/100)+(14*25.4) = 614.6&amp;nbsp;mm (185x70/1270 + 14 = 24.20 in). Another is "195/50R15" with 2*195*(50/100)+(15*25.4) = 576.0&amp;nbsp;mm (195x50/1270 + 15 = 22.68 in). Replacing the first tire (and wheels) with the second (on 15" = 381&amp;nbsp;mm wheels), a speedometer reads 100 * (1-(576/614.6)) = 100 * (1 - 22.68/24.20) = 6.28% higher than the actual speed. At an actual speed of 100&amp;nbsp;km/h (60&amp;nbsp;mph), the speedometer will indicate 100 x 1.0628 = 106.28&amp;nbsp;km/h (60 * 1.0628 = 63.77&amp;nbsp;mph), approximately.

In the case of wear, a new "185/70R14" tyre of 620&amp;nbsp;mm (24.4&amp;nbsp;inch) diameter will have ≈8&amp;nbsp;mm tread depth, at legal limit this reduces to 1.6&amp;nbsp;mm, the difference being 12.8&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter or 0.5&amp;nbsp;inches which is 2% in 620&amp;nbsp;mm (24.4&amp;nbsp;inches).

===International agreements===
In many countries the legislated error in speedometer readings is ultimately governed by the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE) Regulation 39,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.unece.org/trans/main/wp29/wp29regs21-40.html |title=UNECE Transport Division - Vehicle Regulations - Addenda to 1958 agreement - Regulations 21-40 |publisher=UN Economic Commission for Europe |accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which covers those aspects of vehicle type approval that relate to speedometers. The main purpose of the UNECE regulations is to facilitate trade in motor vehicles by agreeing uniform type approval standards rather than requiring a vehicle model to undergo different approval processes in each country where it is sold.

[[European Union]] member states must also grant type approval to vehicles meeting similar EU standards. The ones covering speedometers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2004/39(2)/oj|title=Regulation No 39 of the Economic Commission for Europe of the United Nations (UN/ECE) — Uniform provisions concerning the approval of vehicles with regard to the speedometer equipment including its installation|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=European Commission|accessdate=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31997L0039:EN:NOT | title = Commission Directive 97/39/EC of 24 June 1997 adapting to technical progress Council Directive 75/443/EEC of 26 June 1975 relating to the reverse and speedometer equipment of motor vehicles | work = European Commission | accessdate=2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0007:EN:NOT | title = Directive 2000/7/EC - speedometers for two- or three-wheel motor vehicles | work = European Commission | accessdate=2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; are similar to the UNECE regulation in that they specify that:

* The indicated speed must never be less than the actual speed, i.e. it should not be possible to inadvertently speed because of an incorrect speedometer reading.
* The indicated speed must not be more than 110 percent of the true speed plus 4&amp;nbsp;km/h at specified test speeds. For example, at 80&amp;nbsp;km/h, the indicated speed must be no more than 92&amp;nbsp;km/h.

The standards specify both the limits on accuracy and many of the details of how it should be measured during the approvals process, for example that the test measurements should be made (for most vehicles) at 40, 80 and 120&amp;nbsp;km/h, and at a particular ambient temperature and road surface. There are slight differences between the different standards, for example in the minimum accuracy of the equipment measuring the true speed of the vehicle.

The UNECE regulation relaxes the requirements for vehicles mass-produced following type approval. At Conformity of Production Audits the upper limit on indicated speed is increased to 110 percent plus 6&amp;nbsp;km/h for cars, buses, trucks and similar vehicles, and 110 percent plus 8&amp;nbsp;km/h for two- or three-wheeled vehicles that have a maximum speed above 50&amp;nbsp;km/h (or a cylinder capacity, if powered by a [[heat engine]], of more than 50&amp;nbsp;cm³). European Union Directive 2000/7/EC, which relates to two- and three-wheeled vehicles, provides similar slightly relaxed limits in production.

===Australia===
There were no [[Australian Design Rules]] in place for speedometers in Australia prior to July 1988. They had to be introduced when speed cameras were first used. This means there are no legally accurate speedometers for these older vehicles. All vehicles manufactured on or after 1 July 2007, and all models of vehicle introduced on or after 1 July 2006, must conform to UNECE Regulation 39.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Australian Design Rule 18/03 - Instrumentation | work= Road Vehicle Certification System | url = http://rvcs-prodweb.dot.gov.au/files/ADR%201803.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2008-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The speedometers in vehicles manufactured before these dates but after 1 July 1995 (or 1 January 1995 for forward control passenger vehicles and off-road passenger vehicles) must conform to the previous Australian design rule. This specifies that they need only display the speed to an accuracy of +/- 10% at speeds above 40&amp;nbsp;km/h, and there is no specified accuracy at all for speeds below 40&amp;nbsp;km/h.
All vehicles manufactured in Australia or imported for supply to the Australian market must comply with the Australian Design Rules.

[[Image:Ford Mondeo MK3 ST220 - Speedometer (light).jpg|thumb|A speedometer showing mph and km/h along with an odometer and a separate "trip" odometer (both showing distance traveled in miles).]]
The amended Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 permits the use of speedometers that meet either the requirements of EC Council Directive 75/443 (as amended by Directive 97/39) or UNECE Regulation 39.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

The Motor Vehicles (Approval) Regulations 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2001/20010025.htm#sch3 | title = The Motor Vehicles (Approval) Regulations 2001 : Schedule 3 | work = Office of Public Sector Information | accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; permits single vehicles to be approved. As with the UNECE regulation and the EC Directives, the speedometer must never show an indicated speed less than the actual speed. However it differs slightly from them in specifying that for all actual speeds between 25&amp;nbsp;mph and 70&amp;nbsp;mph (or the vehicles' maximum speed if it is lower than this), the indicated speed must not exceed 110% of the actual speed, plus 6.25&amp;nbsp;mph.

For example, if the vehicle is actually travelling at 50&amp;nbsp;mph, the speedometer must not show more than 61.25&amp;nbsp;mph or less than 50&amp;nbsp;mph.

===United States===
Federal standards in the [[United States]] allow a maximum 5&amp;nbsp;mph error at a speed of 50&amp;nbsp;mph on speedometer readings for commercial vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=98051e4f0cadab4b52ee158a355ccbf6&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=49:5.1.1.2.36.7.12.8&amp;idno=49|title=eCFR — Code of Federal Regulations|work=gpoaccess.gov|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aftermarket modifications, such as different tire and wheel sizes or different differential gearing, can cause speedometer inaccuracy.

{{update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=June 2017}}

== Regulation in the US ==

On September 1, 1979 the [[NHTSA]] required speedometers to have special emphasis on 55&amp;nbsp;mph and display no more than a maximum speed of 85&amp;nbsp;mph.  On March 25, 1982 the NHTSA revoked the rule because no "significant safety benefits" could come from maintaining the standard.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iihs.org/externaldata/srdata/docs/sr1705.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== GPS ==
{{Disputed section|date=September 2015}}
{{Main|Automotive navigation system}}
[[GPS]] devices are positional speedometers, based on how far the receiver has moved since the last measurement. Its speed calculations are not subject to the same sources of error as the vehicle's speedometer (wheel size, transmission/drive ratios). Instead, the GPS's positional accuracy, and therefore the accuracy of its calculated speed, is dependent on the satellite signal quality at the time. Speed calculations will be more accurate at higher speeds, when the ratio of positional error to positional change is lower. The GPS software may also use a [[moving average]] calculation to reduce error. Some GPS devices do not take into account the vertical position of the car so will under report the speed by the road's gradient.

As mentioned in the [[automotive navigation system|satnav]] article, GPS data has been used to overturn a speeding ticket; the GPS logs showed the defendant traveling below the speed limit when they were ticketed. That the data came from a GPS device was likely less important than the fact that it was logged; logs from the vehicle's speedometer could likely have been used instead, had they existed.

Obsolete stock or '''stock obsolescence''' [[calculations]] are done by [[company|companies]] to determine how much of their [[inventory]] (stock) on hand is unlikely to be used in the future.

The financial value of stock obsolescence that is calculated can be entered into a [[general ledger]] system to create a "stock obsolescence provision" which can reduce the [[tax]] [[Liability (financial accounting)|liability]] of a company. For this reason, a systematic and auditable approach to designing a stock obsolescence report should be used. Estimation of stock obsolescence without any traceable calculations will probably not be acceptable to an [[auditor]].

Typically, a stock obsolescence report uses the value of "stock on hand" as a starting point, and then reduces this value based on the potential that stock will be used up in the future. The higher the probability that stock will be used in the future, the more the on-hand [[stock value]] can be reduced. Sometimes a historical usage of the item can also reduce the value, in this case, the more recently the item was used, the more the on-hand value can be reduced.

The formulae that calculate how much the on-hand value can be reduced by may vary from company to company and are normally described in a general way in the [[Generally Accepted Accounting Practices]] (GAAP) for that company or country. For example one formula may be: "If there is any future usage of the item in the next 3 months then reduce the value by 100%, if there is usage in the next 6 months then reduce by 50%, and if it is only going to be used in a year's time then reduce by 10%, if it has been used in the past 6 months then reduce by 70%, if there has been usage in the past year then reduce by 30%."

Some formulae may also take into account the volume used e.g.: reduce the on-hand value by the percentage of product used in the past 6 months.

In [[telecommunications]] a '''link''' is a [[communication channel]] that connects two or more devices. This link may be an actual physical link or it may be a logical link that uses one or more physical links or shares a physical link with other telecommunications links.

A telecommunications link is generally one of several types of information transmission paths such as those provided by [[communication satellite]]s, terrestrial radio communications infrastructure and [[computer networks]] to connect two or more points.

The term ''link'' is widely used in [[computer networking]] to refer to the communications facilities that connect nodes of a network.&lt;ref name="atis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atis.org/glossary/definition.aspx?id=4188|title=network topology|author=ATIS committee PRQC|publisher=[[Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions]]|work=ATIS Telecom Glossary 2007|accessdate=2008-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|Sometimes the communications facilities that provide the communications channel that constitutes a link are also included in the definition of ''link''.}} When the link is a logical link the type of physical link should always be specified (e.g., [[data link]], uplink, downlink, [[fiber optic]] link, [[#Point-to-point|point-to-point link]], etc.)

==Types==
===Point-to-point===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Packet]] --&gt;
{{main|Point-to-point (telecommunications)}}
A point-to-point link is a dedicated link that connects exactly two communication facilities (e.g., two [[Node (networking)|nodes]] of a network, an intercom station at an entryway with a single internal intercom station, a radio path between two points, etc.).

===Broadcast===

Broadcast links connect two or more nodes and support ''broadcast transmission'', where one node can transmit so that all other nodes can receive the same transmission. [[Ethernet]] is an example.

===Multipoint===

Also known as a ''multidrop'' link, a multipoint link is a link that connects ''two or more'' nodes.  Also known as general topology networks, these include [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] and [[Frame Relay]] links, as well as [[X.25]] networks when used as links for a network layer protocol like [[Internet Protocol|IP]].

Unlike broadcast links, there is no mechanism to efficiently send a single message to all other nodes without copying and retransmitting the message.

===Point-to-multipoint===
{{main|Point-to-multipoint communication (telecommunications)}}
A point-to-multipoint link (or simply a ''multipoint'') is a specific type of multipoint link which consists of a central connection endpoint (CE) that is connected to multiple peripheral CEs. Any transmission of data that originates from the central CE is received by all of the peripheral CEs while any transmission of data that originates from any of the peripheral CEs is only received by the central CE.

=== Private and public — accessibility and ownership ===

Links are often referred to by terms which refer to the ownership and / or accessibility of the link.
* A ''private link'' is a link that is either owned by a specific entity or a link that is only accessible by a specific entity.
* A ''public link'' is a link that uses the public switched telephone network or other public utility or entity to provide the link and which may also be accessible by anyone.

== Direction ==
[[File:Uplink y Downlink.jpg|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt; ''Feeder links'', here: ''uplink / downlink'']]
=== Uplink ===
*Pertaining to [[radiocommunication service]], an '''uplink''' (UL or U/L) is the portion of a [[feeder link]] used for the transmission of signals from an [[earth station]] to a [[space radio station]], [[space radio system]] or [[high altitude platform station]].
*Pertaining to [[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] and cellular networks, the radio uplink is the transmission path from the [[mobile station]] (cell phone) to a [[base transceiver station|base station]] (cell site). Traffic and signalling flowing within the [[Base Station Subsystem|BSS]] and [[Network and Switching Subsystem|NSS]] may also be identified as uplink and downlink.
*Pertaining to computer networks, an uplink is a connection from [[data communications equipment]] toward the [[network core]]. This is also known as an [[upstream (networking)|upstream]] connection.

=== Downlink ===
*Pertaining to [[radiocommunication service]], a '''downlink''' (DL or D/L) is the portion of a [[feeder link]] used for the transmission of signals from a [[space radio station]], [[space radio system]] or [[high altitude platform station]] to an [[earth station]].
*In the context of satellite communications, a '''downlink''' (DL) is the link from a satellite to a ground station.
*Pertaining to cellular networks, the radio downlink is the transmission path from a cell site to the cell phone. Traffic and signalling flowing within the [[base station subsystem]] (BSS) and [[network switching subsystem]] (NSS) may also be identified as uplink and downlink.
*Pertaining to computer networks, a downlink is a connection from data communications equipment towards [[data terminal equipment]]. This is also known as a [[downstream (networking)|downstream]] connection.

=== Forward link ===
A '''forward link''' is the link from a fixed location (e.g., a [[base station]]) to a mobile user. If the link includes a [[communications satellite|communications relay satellite]], the forward link will consist of both an [[uplink]] (base station to satellite) and a downlink (satellite to mobile user).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scatmag.com/technical/techarticle-mar05.pdf Basics of C &amp; Ku Band] Scatmag.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reverse link ===
{{See also|Backhaul (telecommunications)|Return channel}}

The '''reverse link''' (sometimes called a ''[[return channel]]'') is the link from a mobile user to a fixed base station.

If the link includes a [[communication satellite|communications relay satellite]], the reverse link will consist of both an [[uplink]] (mobile station to satellite) and a [[downlink]] (satellite to base station) which together constitute a half [[Hop (telecommunications)|hop]].

[[File:Technology and Nursing .jpg|thumb|New telecommunication equipment for nurses and doctors at  Health Sciences North/Horizon Santé-Nord (HSN) in Ontario, Canada.]]
'''Telenursing''' refers to the use of [[telecommunications]] and [[information technology]] in the provision of [[nursing]] services whenever a large physical distance exists between patient and nurse, or between any number of nurses. As a field, it is part of [[telehealth]] and [[telemedicine]], and has many points of contacts with other medical and non-medical applications, such as [[telediagnosis]], teleconsultation, and telemonitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/719335|title=Telehealth, Telenursing, and Advanced Practice Nurses|last=Edmunds|first=Marilyn W.|date=5 April 2010|website=MedScape|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208061343/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/719335|archive-date=2010-12-08|dead-url=yes|access-date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field, however, is still being developed as the information on telenursing isn't comprehensive enough.

Telenursing is achieving a large rate of growth in many countries, due to several factors: the preoccupation in driving down the costs of health care, an increase in the number of [[aging]] and chronically ill population, and the increase in coverage of health care to distant, rural, small or sparsely populated regions. Among its many benefits, telenursing may help solve increasing shortages of nurses; to reduce distances and save travel time, and to keep patients out of hospital. A greater degree of [[job satisfaction]] has been registered among telenurses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-health-insider.com/news/item.cfm?ID=1263 Nurses Happier Using Telecare, Says International Survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618103208/http://www.e-health-insider.com/news/item.cfm?ID=1263 |date=18 June 2006 }}, eHealth Insider website, 15 June 2005, retrieved 4 April 2009;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Telenursing and nursing informatics ==
[[Nursing Informatics|Nursing informatics]], a branch of health informatics, has been defined by Judith Rae Graves and Sheila Corcoran as "a combination of computer science, information science, and nursing science designed to assist in the management and processing of nursing data, information, and knowledge to support the practice of nursing and the delivery of nursing care".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graves|first=J. R.|last2=Corcoran|first2=S.|date=1989|title=The study of nursing informatics|journal=Image--the Journal of Nursing Scholarship|volume=21|issue=4|pages=227–231|issn=0743-5150|pmid=2807330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telenursing is a potential application of nursing informatics and as such, nursing informatics has served as a critical background concept its development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Telenursing|last=Kumar|first=Sajeesh|last2=Snooks|first2=Helen|date=9 July 2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=|isbn=9780857295293|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
{{Globalize|section|date=December 2009}}

=== Home care ===
One of the most distinctive telenursing applications is [[home care]]. For example, patients who are immobilized, or live in remote or difficult to reach places, citizens who have chronic ailments, such as [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[diabetes]], congestive [[heart disease]], or debilitating diseases, such as neural degenerative diseases ([[Parkinson's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]] or [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]]), may stay at home and be "visited" and assisted regularly by a nurse via [[videoconferencing]], internet or [[videophone]]. Other applications of home care are the care of patients in immediate post-surgical situations, the care of wounds, [[ostomy|ostomies]] or  [[Disability|disabled]] individuals. In normal home health care, one nurse is able to visit up to 5-7 patients per day.  Using telenursing, one nurse can “visit” 12-16 patients in the same amount of time.

=== Case management ===
A common application of telenursing is also used by [[call center]]s operated by [[managed care organization]]s, which are staffed by [[registered nurse]]s who act as [[Case management (USA health system)|case managers]] or perform patient [[triage]], information and counseling as a means of regulating patient access and flow and decrease the use of emergency rooms. McKesson is a leading telephone health service provider in the United States of America, as well as in Australia.

=== Telephone triage ===
Telephone triage refers to symptom or clinically-based calls.  Clinicians perform symptom assessment by asking detailed questions about the patient's illness or injury. The clinician's task is to estimate and/or rule out urgent symptoms. They may use pattern recognition and other problem-solving process as well.  Clinicians may utilize guidelines, in paper or electronic format, to determine how urgent the symptoms are. Telephone triage requires clinicians to determine if the symptoms are life-threatening, emergency, urgent, acute or non-acute.  It may involve educating and advising clients, and making safe, effective, and appropriate dispositions—all by telephone. Telephone triage takes place in settings as diverse as emergency rooms, ambulance services, large call centers, physician offices, clinics, student health centers and hospices.

==== Countries using telephone triage ====
An international telenursing survey was completed in 2005, reporting that the 719 responding full-time and part-time registered nurses and advanced practice nurses worked as a telenurse in 36 countries around the world. 68% were reported to be working in the [[United States]], compared to only 0.6% in Finland. Some of these 36 countries include Australia, Canada, Norway, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Iran, Sweden, and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=GRADY|first=JANET L.|last2=SCHLACHTA-FAIRCHILD|first2=LORETTA|title=Report of the 2004-2005 International Telenursing Survey|url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00024665-200709000-00008|journal=Computers, Informatics, Nursing|volume=25|issue=5|pages=266–272|doi=10.1097/01.ncn.0000289163.16122.c2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In Australia ====
In Australia, telephone triages are conducted in Western Australia, Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory, Victoria and Queensland. The first telenursing triage was conducted in Western Australia in 1999, where Triage nurses would estimate patient complexity and refer them to Fremantle Hospital. Due to the remoteness of the Australian landscape it is vital that residents living in rural areas have access to clinical support and care. Telenursing allows nurses to overcome the barriers of distance and gives them the opportunity assist those who are unable to access health care clinics or services due to either the late hour or the distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karabatsos|first=Georgia|last2=Wilson|first2=Andrew|date=June 2008|title=Universal telenursing triage in Australia and New Zealand: A new primary health service|url=https://www.medibankhealth.com.au/files/editor_upload/File/publications/Disposition%20paper%20March%2008_stgeorge.pdf|journal=Australian Family Physician |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=476–9|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal, ethical and regulatory issues ==
Telenursing is fraught with legal, [[ethics|ethical]] and regulatory issues, as it happens with telehealth as a whole. In many countries, interstate and intercountry practice of telenursing is forbidden (the attending nurse must have a license both in their state/country of residence and in the state/country where the patient receiving telecare is located).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hutcherson|first=Carolyn M|date=30 September 2001|title=Legal Considerations for Nurses Practicing in a Telehealth Setting|url=http://www.nursingworld.org/MainMenuCategories/ANAMarketplace/ANAPeriodicals/OJIN/TableofContents/Volume62001/No3Sept01/LegalConsiderations.aspx|journal=Online Journal of Issues in Nursing |volume= 6 |number=3|doi=|pmid=|access-date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nurse Licensure Compact]] helps resolve some of these jurisdiction issues.   Legal issues such as [[accountability]] and [[malpractice]], etc. are also still largely unsolved and difficult to address. Ethical issues include maintaining autonomy, maintaining a patients integrity as well as preventing harm to a patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ihe-online.com/feature-articles/ethical-issues-in-telenursing/|title=Ethical Issues In Telenursing|last=Hoglund|first=A|last2=Holstrom|first2=I|website=International Hospital|publisher=|access-date=12 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604113234/http://www.ihe-online.com/feature-articles/ethical-issues-in-telenursing/|archivedate=4 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there are many considerations related to patient [[confidentiality]] and safety of clinical data.

'''Triconex''' is both the name of a [[Schneider Electric]] brand that supplies products, systems and services for safety, critical control and turbomachinery applications and the name of its hardware devices that utilize its TriStation application software. Triconex products are based on patented [[Triple modular redundancy]] (TMR) industrial safety-shutdown technology. Today, Triconex TMR products operate globally in more than 11,500 installations, making Triconex the largest TMR supplier in the world.

Company History:  The history of Triconex was published in a book called 'The History of a Safer World' by Gary L. Wilkinson.  The company was founded in September, 1983 by Jon Wimer in Santa Ana, California and began operations in March, 1984.  The business plan was written by Wimer and Peter Pitsker, an automation industry veteran and Stanford graduate.  They presented the plan for a TMR (Triple Modular Redundant) based system that would improve the safety and reliability in industrial applications. Among the customers they targeted were the petro-chemical giants, such as Exxon, Shell, Chevron, and BP.

Pitsker and Wimer presented the business plan to Los Angeles based investor Chuck Cole, who was also a professor at USC.  Cole was interested, so he contacted his personal attorney, future two-time Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan.  Riordan agreed to invest $50,000 and Cole's venture capital team matched it, providing the seed money for Triconex.  After two years, however, the company nearly failed due to the expense and complications of testing a new safety system.  In February, 1986, founder Wimer left the company and the board asked a seasoned executive, William K. Barkovitz to become CEO.  Barkovitz ended up leading the company for 9 years.  At the end of his term, Triconex became the leading safety system in a market it largely created, made acquisitions, and completed an IPO. In January, 1994, Triconex was acquired by British based SIEBE for 90 million dollars.

The hardware architect of the Tricon was Gary Hufton, the Software development manager was Glen Alleman. These managers, with Wing Toy (the lead engineering of the fault tolerant ESS telephone switch), led a small successful engineering team that built the first Tricon, sold in June, 1986.  Soon after, Exxon became a customer and automation giant Honeywell agreed to distribute the Tricon.  Among the software engineers who worked for Triconex were Phil Huber and Dennis Morin, who later left the company to found Wonderware, also based in Irvine California which became the world's leading supplier of Human Machine Interface (HMI).  

== System ==
Triconex system is based on the TMR patented technology that supports up to [[Safety Integrity Level|SIL 3]] and is usually used as a safety rather than control system.&lt;ref&gt;Safety Considerations Guide for Tricon v9 Systems, © 2004 Invensys Systems, Document No. 9720097-001&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operating theory===
Fault tolerance in the Tricon is achieved by means of a Triple-Modular Redundant(TMR) architecture. The Tricon provides error-free, uninterrupted control in the presence of either hard failures of components, or transient faults from internal or external sources.
The Tricon is designed with a fully triplicated architecture throughout, from the input modules through the Main Processors to the output modules. Every I/O module houses the circuitry for three independent legs.
Each leg on the input modules reads the process data and passes that
information to its respective Main Processor. The three Main Processors communicate with each other using a proprietary high-speed bus system called the TriBus. Once per scan, the three Main
Processors synchronize and communicate with their two neighbors over
the TriBus. The Tricon votes digital input data, compares output data, and sends copies of analog input data to each Main Processor.
The Main Processors execute the userwritten application and send outputs generated by the application to the output modules. In addition to voting the input data, the TriBus votes the output data. This is done on the output modules as close to the field as possible, in order to detect and compensate for any errors that could occur between the Tricon voting and the final output driven to the field.

=== Hardware===
The Triconex system usually consists of the following typical modules:&lt;ref&gt;Technical Product Guide Tricon Systems, © 2006–2007 by Invensys Systems, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Main Processor modules (triple).
* Communication module(s) .
* Input and output modules: can be analog and/or digital and work singular or in  hot-spare (standby).
* Power supply modules (redundant).
* Backplane(s) (chassis) that can hold the previous modules.
* System cabinet(s): can compact one or more chassis in one cabinet.
* Marshalling cabinets to adapt and standardize interface connections between the field instruments and  the Triconex system cabinets.
* Human machine interface (HMI) to monitor the events.
*  Engineering workstation (EWS) for programming. monitoring, troubleshooting and updating.

===Software===
The Triconex main processors can communicate with the so-called TriStation 1131 application software to download, update and/or monitor programs.&lt;ref&gt;Developer’s Guide-TriStation 1131, Version 4.1© 2004 Invensys Systems, Document No. 9720100-001&lt;/ref&gt; These programs are either written in:
* [[Function Block Diagram]] language,
* [[Ladder logic|Ladder diagram]] language, or
* [[Structured text]] ([[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] like) Language.
* Cause and Effect Matrix Programmable Language (CEMPLE).
Besides, a Sequence of Events (SOE) recorder software and Diagnostic monitor software are implemented.

=== Triton malware ===
In December 2017 it was reported that the safety systems of an unidentified power station, believed to be in [[Saudi Arabia]] were compromised when the Triconex industrial safety technology made by Schneider Electric SE was targeted in what is believed to have been a state sponsored attack. The computer security company [[Symantec]] claimed that the malware, known as "Triton" exploited a vulnerability in computers running the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/15/triton-hackers-malware-attack-safety-systems-energy-plant|title=Triton: hackers take out safety systems in 'watershed' attack on energy plant|last=Gibbs|first=Samuel|date=2017-12-15|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''UnionPay''' ({{zh|s=银联|p=Yínlián}}), also known as '''China UnionPay''' ({{zh|s=中国银联|p=Zhōngguó Yínlián}}) or by its abbreviation, '''CUP''', is a Chinese [[financial services]] corporation headquartered in [[Shanghai]], [[China]].  It provides [[bank card]] services and a major [[card scheme]] in [[mainland China]]. Founded on March 26, 2002, China UnionPay is an association for China's banking card industry, operating under the approval of the [[People's Bank of China]] (PBOC, central bank of China).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unionpayintl.com/en/aboutUs/companyProfile/introductiontoUPI/|title=Introduction - UnionPay International|last=|first=|date=|website=www.unionpayintl.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the only [[interbank network]] in China that links all the [[automatic teller machine]] (ATMs) of all [[bank]]s throughout the country. It is also an [[electronic funds transfer]] at [[point of sale]] ([[EFTPOS]]) network.

==History==
[[File:UnionPay used in Chiba 20160212.jpg|thumb|UnionPay decal on the door of a dining hall.]]
With the approval of the [[People's Bank of China]], China UnionPay was launched on March 26, 2002, in Shanghai by PBOC governor [[Dai Xianglong]], The [[Industrial and Commercial Bank of China]], the [[Agricultural Bank of China]], the [[Bank of China]] and the [[China Construction Bank]] served as its first members.&lt;ref name=UnionPay1&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.pbc.gov.cn/english/130721/2830453/index.html| title=Remarks by Mr. Dai Xianglong, Governor of the PBC at the Opening Ceremony of China Unionpay| publisher=[[People's Bank of China]]| date=26 March 2002| author=Dai Xianglong| accessdate=27 September 2009 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the concept of a unified Chinese bank card network dates back to 1993, with the formation of the "[[Golden Card Project]]" advocated by then-Chinese president [[Jiang Zemin]]. UnionPay is considered its descendant, although attempts at unifying China's various credit card and interbank networks have been in place since the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Links&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pbc.gov.cn/english//detail.asp?col=6400&amp;ID=77 |title=Strong Measures to be Taken to Achieve the Target of Connecting Bank-Card Networks This Year |publisher=[[People's Bank of China]] |date=27 March 2002|accessdate=27 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606051506/http://www.pbc.gov.cn/english/detail.asp?col=6400&amp;ID=77 |archivedate=6 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, UnionPay was reported to have been contributing to [[capital flight]] from China through poorly regulated store front operations in [[Macau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/12/us-china-unionpay-special-report-idUSBREA2B00820140312 |title=Special Report: How China's official bank card is used to smuggle money |last1=Pomfret |first1=James |date=11 March 2014 |website=www.reuters.com |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global alliance===
{{see|Card reciprocal agreements}}
In 2005, UnionPay entered into agreements with other payment networks to increase acceptance around the world. Some major examples include:

* [[Discover Card|Discover]]
* [[RuPay]] in India
* [[JCB Co., Ltd.|JCB]] in Japan
* [[BC Card]] in South Korea

==Logo==
{{Cleanup section|date=November 2018|reason=Citations needed}}

The CUP logo originated in China before the establishment of the CUP network system.  The red, blue, and green color block design represented the integration of cooperation, steady flow, and safety assurance. It is accompanied by the Chinese characters for "UnionPay" in white. The logo was first registered in 1997 and launched in the Shenzhen trial.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

China UnionPay started a limited trial card distribution in March 2001. By January 2002, many banks and financial institutions began a larger trial in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Shenzhen and five other five cities , which gradually extended to the entire country.

On October 18, 2005, China UnionPay announced a new logo. The new card kept the three-colors of the old logo while other elements were adjusted. The new logo also featured increased use of English. At present, both card styles are in circulation, with the old UnionPay cards being gradually replaced.

CUP was initially concerned that overseas merchants might fail to recognise the new logo and refuse to accept new-style UnionPay cards. Therefore, for a period, unified domestic debit and [[renminbi]] (RMB) single currency credit cards used the new logo, while international debit cards and dual currency credit cards used the old logo. From the beginning of 2009, dual-currency credit card banks began to gradually introduce the use of the new UnionPay logo.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

On the introduction of [[EMV]] chips into China UnionPay cards,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emvco.com/about/emvco-members/|title=EMVCo Members|website=EMVCo|language=en-US|access-date=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; banks also introduced QuickPass ({{zh|s=闪付}}), a [[contactless smart card]] feature similar to MasterCard's PayPass or Visa's payWave. QuickPass is accepted in many supermarkets and fast food stores.
Quickpass is also supported by several [[digital wallet]] providers such as [[Samsung Pay]] and [[Apple Pay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2015/12/18Apple-China-UnionPay-to-Bring-Apple-Pay-to-China/|title=Apple &amp; China UnionPay to Bring Apple Pay to China|work=Apple Newsroom|access-date=19 April 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online payments==
UnionPay is China's first financial-level pre-authorization service for secured transactions. The system allows payment for online shopping at any merchant that accepts UnionPay. In 2014, the total amount of cross-bank transactions of CUP card exceeded 41.1 trillion yuan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.centennialcollege.hku.hk/f/upload/2134/UnionPay_15_001C.pdf |title=WILL CHINA UNIONPAY  EXPAND FROM A  DOMESTIC MONOPOLY TO A GLOBAL PLAYER? |last=Yip |first=Amy |website=centennialcollege.hku.hk |pages=5 |access-date=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use abroad==
UnionPay cards can be used in 162 countries and regions around the world, making it the third-largest payment network by value of transactions processed, behind Visa and MasterCard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nilsonreport.com/publication_chart_and_graphs_archive.php?1=1&amp;year=2015 | title=Purchase Transactions Worldwide| publisher=nilsonreport.com| date=1 March 2015| accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some UnionPay credit cards are also affiliated with American Express, [[MasterCard]] or Visa, and they can be used abroad as an American Express, MasterCard or Visa. UnionPay debit cards, however, can only be used in the UnionPay network and other networks that have signed contracts with UnionPay. Since 2006, China UnionPay cards can be used in over 100 countries outside China.&lt;ref name=Foreign&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-02/04/content_4133801.htm |title = China UnionPay extends coverage globally |publisher   = [[Xinhua news agency]] |date= 2 February 2006 |accessdate  = 27 September 2009 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071007170904/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-02/04/content_4133801.htm |archivedate = 7 October 2007 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, [[Discover Network]] announced an alliance with China UnionPay Network. The two companies have signed a long-term agreement that allows acceptance of Discover Network brand cards at UnionPay ATMs and point-of-sale terminals in China and acceptance of China UnionPay cards on the [[Pulse (interbank network)|PULSE]] network in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Discover&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pbc.gov.cn/english//detail.asp?col=6400&amp;ID=617&amp;keyword=discover |title=China UnionPay accepted in U.S. on Discover/Pulse networks  |publisher=[[People's Bank of China]]  |date=6 December 2005 |accessdate=27 September 2009 |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316163534/http://www.pbc.gov.cn/english//detail.asp?col=6400&amp;ID=617&amp;keyword=discover |archivedate=16 March 2007 |df=

[[File:Parabolic-antenna-SHF-updown.jpg|thumb|A 2.5 m [[Parabolic antenna|parabolic]] [[Satellite dish|dish]] antenna for bidirectional [[satellite Internet access]] ]]

A '''very small aperture terminal''' ('''VSAT''') is a two-way [[satellite]] [[ground station]] with a [[satellite dish|dish antenna]] that is smaller than 3.8 meters. The majority of VSAT antennas range from 75&amp;nbsp;cm to 1.2 m. [[Data rate units|Data rates]], in most cases, range from 4 kbit/s up to 16 Mbit/s. VSATs access satellites in [[geosynchronous orbit]] or [[geostationary orbit]] to relay data from small remote Earth stations (terminals) to other terminals (in [[mesh networking|mesh]] [[Network topology|topology]]) or master Earth station "hubs" (in [[Star network|star topology]]).

VSATs are used to transmit [[narrowband]] data (e.g., [[point of sale|point-of-sale]] transactions using credit cards, polling or [[Radio Frequency Identification|RFID]] data, or [[SCADA]]), or [[broadband]] data (for the provision of [[satellite Internet access]] to remote locations, [[VoIP]] or video). VSATs are also used for transportable, on-the-move (utilising [[phased array]] antennas) or mobile [[ocean|maritime]] communications.

==History==
The concept of the [[geostationary orbit]] was originated by Russian theorist [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]], who wrote articles on [[space exploration|space travel]] around the beginning of the 20th century. In the 1920s, [[Hermann Oberth]] and [[Herman Potocnik]], also known as Herman Noordung, described an orbit at an altitude of {{convert|35,900|km|miles}} whose [[Orbital period|period]] exactly matched the Earth's rotational period, making it appear to hover over a fixed point on the Earth's [[equator]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://celestrak.com/columns/v04n07/ CelesTrak: "Basics of the Geostationary Orbit"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur C. Clarke|Arthur C. Clarke's]] October 1945 ''[[Electronics World|Wireless World]]'' article (called "Extra-Terrestrial Relays: Can Rocket Stations Give World-wide Radio Coverage?") discussed the necessary [[Orbital elements|orbital characteristics]] for a geostationary orbit and the frequencies and power needed for communication.

Live satellite communication was developed in the 1960s by [[NASA]], which called it [[Syncom]] 1-3.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_388.html NASA - The First Geosynchronous Satellite&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It transmitted live coverage of the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Olympics]] in [[Japan]] to viewers in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. On April 6, 1965, the first commercial satellite was launched into space, [[Intelsat I]], nicknamed Early Bird.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/appel/ask-academy/issues/ask-oce/AO_1-7_SF_history.html Academy of Program/Project and Engineering Leadership (APPEL) | NASA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629025241/http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/appel/ask-academy/issues/ask-oce/AO_1-7_SF_history.html |date=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercial VSATs were C band (6&amp;nbsp;GHz) receive-only systems by Equatorial Communications using [[spread spectrum]] technology. More than 30,000 60&amp;nbsp;cm antenna systems were sold in the early 1980s. Equatorial later developed a C band (4/6&amp;nbsp;GHz) two-way system using 1 m x 0.5 m antennas and sold about 10,000 units in 1984–85.

In the early 80s, LINKABIT (the predecessor to Qualcomm and ViaSat) developed the world's first Ku-band (12–14&amp;nbsp;GHz) VSAT for Schlumberger to provide network connectivity for oil field [[Oil platform|drilling]] and exploration units. LINKABIT which had become part of M/A-COM went on to develop {{Ku band}} VSATs for enterprise customers such as [[Walmart]], [[Holiday Inn]], [[Chrysler]], and [[General Motors]]. These enterprise terminals made up the vast majority of sites for the next 20 years for two-way data or telephony applications. A large VSAT network, with more than 12,000 sites, was deployed by [[Spacenet]] and MCI for the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]] in the 1980s. Today, the largest VSAT Ku-band network containing over 100,000 VSATs was deployed by and is operated by [[Hughes Communications]] for [[lottery]] applications.

In 2005, WildBlue (now ViaSat) started deploying VSAT networks deploying Ka-band. ViaSat launched the highest capacity satellite ever, ViaSat-1, in 2011 to expand the WildBlue base under its Exede brand. In 2007, [[Hughes Communications]] started deploying {{Ka band}} VSAT sites for consumers under its HughesNet brand on the Spaceway 3 satellite and later in 2012 on its [[EchoStar XXVII]]/Jupiter 1 satellite. By September 2014, Hughes became the first Satellite Internet Provider to surpass one million active terminals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hughes.com/resources/hughes-becomes-first-satellite-internet-provider-to-surpass-one-million-active-users-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Configurations==

Most VSAT networks are configured in one of these [[network topology|topologies]]:
* A [[star topology]], using a central uplink site, such as a [[network operations center]] (NOC), to transport data back and forth to each VSAT via satellite,
* A [[mesh topology]], where each VSAT relays data via satellite to another terminal by acting as a hub, minimizing the need for a centralized uplink site,
* A combination of both star and mesh topologies. Some VSAT networks are configured by having several centralized uplink sites (and VSAT stemming from it) connected in a multi-star topology with each star (and each terminal in each star) connected to each other in a mesh topology. Others configured in only a single-star topology sometimes will have each terminal connected to each other as well, resulting in each terminal acting as a central hub. These configurations are utilized to minimize the overall cost of the network, and to alleviate the amount of data that has to be relayed through a central uplink site (or sites) of a star or multi-star network.

==Future applications==

Advances in technology have dramatically improved the [[price–performance ratio]] of [[Fixed Service Satellite|fixed satellite service]] (FSS) over the past five years. New VSAT systems are coming online using {{Ka band}} technology that promise higher data rates for lower costs.

FSS systems currently in orbit have a huge capacity with a relatively low price structure. FSS systems provide various applications for subscribers, including: [[telephony]], [[fax]], [[television]], high-speed [[data communication]] services, Internet access, [[satellite news gathering]] (SNG), [[Digital Audio Broadcasting]] (DAB) and others. These systems provide high-quality service because they create efficient communication systems for both residential and business users.

==Constituent parts of a VSAT configuration==

* [[Antenna (radio)|Antenna]]
* [[Block upconverter]] (BUC)
* [[Low-noise block downconverter]] (LNB)
* [[Orthomode transducer]] (OMT)
* Interfacility link cable (IFL)
* [[Indoor unit]] (IDU)

All the outdoor parts on the dish are collectively called the ODU (Outdoor Unit), i.e., OMT to split signal between BUC and LNB. The IDU is effectively a modem, usually with ethernet port and 2 x F-connectors for the coax to BUC (Transmit) and from LNB (Receive). The Astra2Connect has an all-in-one OMT/BUC/LNA that looks like a Quad LNB in shape and size which mounts on a regular TV satellite mount. As a consequence it is only 500&amp;nbsp;mW compared with the normal 2W, thus is poorer in rain. Skylogic's [[Tooway]] system also uses an integrated OMT/BUC/LNB assembly called a [[transmit and receive integrated assembly]] (TRIA), which is 3W.

== Maritime VSAT ==

A maritime VSAT has features that allow it to be operated on a ship at sea. A ship that is underway is in continuous motion in all axes. The antenna part of a marine VSAT system must be stabilized with respect to the horizon and [[true north]] as the ship moves beneath it. Motors and sensors are used to keep the antenna pointed accurately at the satellite. This enables it to transmit to and receive from the satellite whilst minimising losses and interference with adjacent satellites. New technology is emerging which allows a solid state device (flat panel) to electronically steer the antenna without moving parts, this new technology is in its infancy but will be a major game changer for the industry.

=== Technology ===

Initially, stabilized satellite antennas were used on ships for reception of television signals. One of the first companies to manufacture stabilized VSAT antennas was SeaTel of [[Concord, California|Concord]], [[California]], which launched its first stabilized antenna in 1978. SeaTel dominates the supply of two-way VSAT stabilised antenna systems to the marine industry with almost 72% of the market in 2007 compared to Orbit's 17.6%.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.comsys.co.uk/vm1e_mn.htm The Comsys Maritime VSAT Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523033524/http://www.comsys.co.uk/vm1e_mn.htm |date=May 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, maritime VSAT was using [[single channel per carrier]] technology, which suited large-volume users like oil drilling rigs and [[oil platforms]] and large fleets of ships from one shipowner sailing within one or few [[Footprint (satellite)|satellite footprints]]. This changed when the company [[iDirect]] launched its IP-based [[time-division multiple access]] technology that dynamically allocated bandwidth to each ship for shared bandwidth, lowering the entry-level cost for getting maritime VSAT installed, which turned out to be of key importance to small to mid-sized fleets, and thus to the market acceptance of VSAT.

===Market===

According to the Maritime VSAT report issued by the Comsys Group, the market for stabilised maritime VSAT services (not including oil and gas rigs) reached more than $400 million in 2007.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In 2010, [[Comsys|COMSYS]] released its "2nd Maritime VSAT Report", where the market estimate had increased to $590 million in 2009 with predictions for 2010 at $850 million. The estimated size of the market in terms of vessels eligible to get VSAT was in this report set to in excess of 42.000 with just over 34.000 to go. The major companies market share in terms of number of vessels in service were in 2009 (2007 in parenthesis) according to these reports: Vizada: 17.6% (26.0%), Ship Equip: 11.0% (10.7%), Cap Rock 2.8% (2.9%), MTN 7.5% (6.4%), Stratos - % (3.6%), KVH 5.4% (- %) Elektrikom 4.9% (3.2%), Intelsat 3.4% (- %), Eutelsat 3.1%, NSSL 3.1%, Radio Holland 3.0%, Telemar 3.0%, DTS 2.6% and others accounted for 32.6% (27.7%). Many of the major providers have branded their maritime VSAT offerings such that [[Vizada]] offers its service through the Marlink division and the SeaLink and WaveCall products, OmniAccess, through their BroadBEAM&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satnews.com/story.php?number=205261551 iDirect... Evolution Makes Its Way To OmniAccess (SATCOM)] / Sat Magazine, January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; products and Ship Equip calls its offering [[Sevsat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satmagazine.com/story.php?number=606155997 The Maritime Market: VSAT Rules] / Sat Magazine, December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
Modern VSAT systems are a prime example of convergence, and hence require skills from both the [[Radio frequency|RF]] and [[Internet Protocol|IP]] domains. VSAT-specific training includes:

* [[ITC Global Career Certifications|ITC Global VSAT Career Certifications]]
* Global VSAT Forum VSAT Installer Certification
* Global VSAT provider

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8209">The [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratory's]] '''Voder''' (from ''Voice Operating Demonstrator'') was the first attempt to electronically [[Speech synthesis|synthesize human speech]] by breaking it down into its acoustic components. It was invented by [[Homer Dudley]] in 1937–1938 and developed on his earlier work on the [[vocoder]].  The quality of the speech was limited; however, it demonstrated the synthesis of the human voice, which became one component of the vocoder used in voice communications for security and to save bandwidth.&lt;ref name=Gold11&gt;Ben Gold, Nelson Morgan, Dan Ellis, ''Speech and Audio Signal Processing: Processing and Perception of Speech and Music''.

&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
The Voder synthesized human speech by imitating the effects of the human [[vocal tract]]. The operator could select one of two basic sounds by using a wrist bar. A buzz tone generated by a [[relaxation oscillator]] produced the voiced vowels and nasal sounds, with the pitch controlled by a foot pedal. A hissing noise produced by a white noise tube created the sibilants (voiceless [[Fricative consonant|fricative sounds]]).  These initial sounds were passed through a bank of 10 [[band pass filter]]s that were selected by keys; their outputs were combined, amplified and fed to a loudspeaker.  The filters were controlled by a set of keys and a foot pedal to convert the hisses and tones into vowels, consonants, and inflections.  Additional special keys were provided to make the [[plosive]] sounds such as "p" or "d", and the [[Affricate consonant|affrictive sounds]] of the "j" in "jaw" and the "ch" in "cheese". This was a complex machine to operate. After months of practice, a trained operator could produce recognizable speech.&lt;ref name=Gold11/&gt;

}}

Performances on the Voder were featured at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] and in [[Golden Gate International Exposition|San Francisco]].  Twenty operators were trained by Mrs. Helen Harper, particularly noted for her skill with the machine. The machine said the words "Good afternoon, radio audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Guernsey |first=Lisa |date=August 9, 2001 |title=The Desktop That Does Elvis |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/09/technology/the-desktop-that-does-elvis.html |work=The New York Times |location= |access-date=January 21, 2018 |quote=At the 1939 World's Fair in New York City, AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, a forerunner of AT&amp;T Labs, unveiled a speech machine called the Voder. Six women were trained to operate the contraption, which was played like a pipe organ. When the machine said, "Good afternoon, radio audience," it sounded like an alien speaking under water. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Voder was developed from research into compression schemes for transmission of voice on copper wires and for voice encryption. In 1948, [[Werner Meyer-Eppler]]&lt;ref name="meyer-eppler"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognized the capability of the Voder machine to generate electronic music, as described in Dudley's patent.

Whereas the [[vocoder]] analyzes speech, transforms it into electronically transmitted information, and recreates it, the voder generates synthesized speech by means of a console with fifteen touch-sensitive keys and a pedal.  It basically consists of the "second half" of the vocoder, but with manual filter controls, and requires a highly trained operator.&lt;ref name="wendycarlosQA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Wendy Carlos Vocoder Q&amp;A |url=http://www.wendycarlos.com/vocoders.html |publisher=Wendy Carlos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="120years-HomerDudley"&gt;{{cite web |title=Homer Dudley's Speech Synthesisers, "The Vocoder" (1940) &amp; "Voder"(1939) |work=Electronic Musical Instrument 1870–1990 |url=http://120years.net/machines/vocoder/ |publisher=120 Years of Electronic Music (120years.net)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1301">'''Whistle mix''' is a general term to refer to any [[pyrotechnic]] composition that emits a whistling sound when pressed into a tube and ignited.  It is used as a [[rocket propellant]], particularly in small [[bottle rocket]]s. Whistle mix tends to be fast burning and [[Brisance|brisant]]; therefore it is also used as [[burst charge]] in shells.

A typical whistle mix is made from 70% [[potassium perchlorate]] and 30% [[sodium benzoate]], measured by weight. The fuel in most whistle compositions is a salt of an organic acid. Compositions with [[chlorate]]s and [[gallic acid salt|gallate]]s were used historically, but have now been abandoned as prone to accidental ignition.   These mixtures however, are less sensitive than the formerly used ones, which often contained mixtures with [[picric acid]] and [[potassium picrate]]. 

Whistle compositions tend to be particularly sensitive. To achieve the whistling behavior, the composition must be in a tube and be formed into a solid grain; it otherwise burns too rapidly and just [[explosion|explodes]]. The composition is typically compressed using an arbor or [[hydraulic press]]. Ramming with a [[mallet]] (which is acceptable for many other compositions) may result in an explosion.

A '''yaw-rate sensor''' is a [[gyroscopic]] device that measures a vehicle’s [[angular velocity]] around its vertical axis.  The angle between the vehicle's heading and vehicle actual movement direction is called [[slip angle]], which is related to the [[yaw rate]].

==Types==

There are basically two types of Yaw rate sensors: [[piezoelectric]] type and [[Micromechanics|micromechanical]] type.

In the piezoelectric type, the sensor is a "[[tuning fork]]"-shaped structure with four [[Piezoelectricity|piezo]] elements (two on top and two below).  During straight ahead driving, the upper ones produce no voltage as no [[Coriolis force]] acts. But in cornering, the rotational movement causes the upper part of the tuning fork to leave the oscillatory plane creating an [[alternating current]] [[voltage]] which is proportional to the yaw rate and oscillatory speed. The output signal's sign depends on the direction (left or right).

In the micromechanical type, the Coriolis acceleration is measured by a micro-mechanical capacitive acceleration sensor placed on an oscillating element. This acceleration is proportional to the product of yaw rate and the oscillatory velocity, which is maintained electronically at a constant value.

A yaw-sensor is needed for [[Electronic stability control]].

==Applications==

Yaw rate sensors are used in aircraft and in the [[electronic stability control]] systems of cars.
