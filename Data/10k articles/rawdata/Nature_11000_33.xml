In [[Hinduism]], '''Aranyani''' is a goddess of the [[forest]]s and the [[animal]]s that dwell within them.

Aranyani has the distinction of having one of the most descriptive hymns in the ''[[Rigveda]]'' dedicated to her, in which she is described as being elusive, fond of quiet glades in the jungle, and fearless of remote places. In the hymn, the supplicant entreats her to explain how she wanders so far from the fringe of civilization without becoming afraid or lonely. She wears anklets with bells, and though seldom seen, she can be heard by the tinkling of her anklets.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hymns of the Rigveda'', [[Ralph T. H. Griffith]], 1973. Hymn CXLVI, Page 640&lt;/ref&gt; She is also described as a dancer. Her ability to feed both man and animals though she 'tills no lands' is what the supplicant finds most marvellous. The hymn is repeated in [[Taittiriya Brahmana]] and interpreted by the commentator of that work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Muir|first=John|title=Original Sanskrit Texts on the Origin and History of the People of India|year=1870|publisher=Trubner and Co|location=London|pages=422|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ymLZAAAAMAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aranyani bears resemblance to later day forest deities like [[Bonobibi]] in Bengal, [[Vanadevata]] in [[Goa]] and [[Konkan]], [[Wanadurga|Vanadurga]] in parts of [[South India]]. Her worship has declined in modern-day Hinduism, and it is rare to find a temple dedicated to Aranyani. However, there is a temple dedicated to her in [[Arrah]], [[Bihar]] known as the Aranya Devi Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dalal|first=Roshen|title=The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths|year=2010|publisher=Penguin Books India|location=India|pages=28|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=pNmfdAKFpkQC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=The+Religions+of+India:+A+Concise+Guide+to+Nine+Major+Faiths+page+28&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FNS-hIv6bb&amp;sig=2_PWD4lKjib89EwiTE8ovoaZNl4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQ0s2kuYDTAhVGuI8KHd1OB2EQ6AEILjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Religions%20of%20India%3A%20A%20Concise%20Guide%20to%20Nine%20Major%20Faiths%20page%2028&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The destination habitat may have either historically held the species or it may not have hosted the species, but the habitat provides the [[Bioclimatology|bioclimatic]] requirements to support it. Assisted colonization may also supplement an existing population in a site where their numbers are dwindling.&lt;ref name=McLachlanH&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McLachlan | first1 = J.

=== Climate change and species range shifts ===
[[Climate change]] is expected to drive many species out of parts of their current [[species distribution|ranges]] while creating new suitable habitats elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature02121 |pmid=14712274 |last1=Thomas |first1=C.

=== Assisted colonization vs. species introduction ===
Assisted colonization is a specific type of [[introduced species|species introduction]]. An introduction is any act of establishing a species in a habitat it does not currently occupy. It often refers to a long-distance relocation, such as the accidental introduction of an [[invasive species]] from one continent to another, or the intentional relocation of a species in decline to a habitat where it can persist. By contrast, assisted colonization acknowledges that the natural [[biological dispersal|dispersal]] rate of many species may be too slow to naturally respond to rapid human-caused environmental change and asks, “if this species could disperse fast enough to keep pace with the changing environment, where would it establish?” Assisted colonization practitioners consider helping the species disperse into such sites, which are often immediately adjacent to the species’ historical range.&lt;ref name=Hunter&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hunter | first1 = M. L. | title = Climate Change and Moving Species: Furthering the Debate on Assisted Colonization | doi = 10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00780.x | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 1356–1358 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17883502| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assisted colonization thus represents a small artificial boost to an otherwise natural process, acknowledging that the threat—rapid human-caused environmental change—was produced by humans in the first place. Confusion of assisted colonization with species introduction in general—often much larger in scale and with greater risk of adverse impacts—may be the principal reason why some are reluctant to consider assisted colonization (see [[#Controversy|Controversy]], below).&lt;ref name=Mueller&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mueller | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Hellmann | first2 = J.

=== Terminology ===
When first proposed, the idea was referred to as “assisted migration”.&lt;ref name=McLachlanH/&gt; The terminology was later criticized for being reminiscent of natural, cyclic animal migrations in response to changing seasons.&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt; It was renamed “assisted colonization,” as colonization more accurately describes the natural phenomenon that management would seek to assist. Others have sought to further distinguish this idea from any natural process by referring to it as “managed relocation.”&lt;ref name=Sax&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sax | first1 = D.

=== Acclimatization and adaptation as alternatives to colonization ===
Even under rapid climate change, dispersal into new areas may not be necessary for some species to persist. Instead of tracking climate shifts through space, some species may be able to survive in their present locations by developing tolerance to new conditions through [[acclimatization]] and/or [[adaptation]].&lt;ref name=Rice&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rice|first1=Kevin J.|last2=Emery|first2=Nancy C.|year=2003|title=Managing microevolution: Restoration in the face of global change|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|volume=1|issue=9|pages=469–478|doi=10.2307/3868114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skelly"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Skelly | first1 = D.

One study determined that evolution of higher temperature tolerance in some species of amphibians and reptiles will likely occur fast enough to allow these species to survive a 3&amp;nbsp;°C temperature increase over 100 years, consistent with low- to mid-range projections of global warming.&lt;ref name=Skelly/&gt; By contrast, many species, such as most [[temperate]] trees, have longer generation times and therefore may adapt more slowly; they may take thousands of years to evolve a similar increase in temperature tolerance.&lt;ref name=Rice/&gt;&lt;ref name=Skelly/&gt; Adaptation this slow would be insufficient for keeping up with expected future global warming if colonization of new habitats is not an option.

== Types ==
Generally speaking, there are three accepted ways that assisted colonization can take place, each one of them with specific benefits and situations in which it applies. They can be defined as reintroduction, introduction and augmentation processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Weeks|first = Andrew R|last2 = Sgro|first2 = Carla M|last3 = Young|first3 = Andrew G|last4 = Frankham|first4 = Richard|last5 = Mitchell|first5 = Nicki J|last6 = Miller|first6 = Kim A|last7 = Byrne|first7 = Margaret|last8 = Coates|first8 = David J|last9 = Eldridge|first9 = Mark D B|date = 2011-11-01|title = Assessing the benefits and risks of translocations in changing environments: a genetic perspective|journal = Evolutionary Applications|volume = 4|issue = 6|pages = 709–725|doi = 10.1111/j.1752-4571.2011.00192.x|issn = 1752-4571|pmc = 3265713|pmid = 22287981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Augmentation ===
In augmentation, a population is identified with a small number of mating individuals. This can lead to many problems, including inbreeding depression, and often leads to a dwindling number of individuals. Further complicating matters, with such a small population and consistent inbreeding depression, genetic drift is of worry as well, leading to high levels of homozygosity. To combat these problems, individuals are reintroduced to the population. This can be done via ''ex situ'' breeding of individuals or by physically relocating a separate population to join the identified, problematic population.

=== Introduction ===
In introduction, a species is brought to a habitat in which it has never before existed. This can be done for a number of reasons, ranging from climate change associated habitat loss to the introduction of predator species that cannot be controlled. Generally speaking, this is the type of assisted colonization that contains the most potential for harmful effects, like those described elsewhere in this article. Currently, a number of introductions of endangered populations from Australia have been made with varying degrees of success to small islands near the mainland where the only reason that the population had not dispersed before was due to the physical waterway.

=== Reintroduction ===
Reintroductions involve restoring a species to its native range. The species may no longer be found there due to any number of reasons, though most common is often the introduction of predators or habitat loss due to either climate change or other human factors. This is generally done to broaden the range of threatened populations and to reconnect fragmented populations.

==Controversy==
Significant controversy has developed around the idea of assisted colonization since it was first put forth in the scientific literature in 2007.&lt;ref name=McLachlanH/&gt; The two sides can be separated roughly as follows. Supports generally believe that the expected benefits of assisted colonization, including saving and strengthening species, outweighs the potential harm of any project. Detractors generally believe that other conservation techniques which do not include the high risk of invasive species are not only better suited but are also more likely to succeed. This debate continues throughout the literature generally due to a lack of real-world applications and follow-ups. Though these conservation efforts are becoming increasingly common, few long term looks at their success have been conducted.&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt;

===Invasive species risk===
Perhaps the principal concern scientists have expressed over assisted colonization is the potential for relocated species to be invasive in their new habitats, driving out native species.&lt;ref name=Simberloff&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ricciardi | first1 = A. | last2 = Simberloff | first2 = D. | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2008.12.006 | title = Assisted colonization is not a viable conservation strategy | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 248 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fear that assisted colonization will facilitate invasions stems mostly from observations of the vast numbers of species that have become invasive outside their native ranges by (often inadvertent) introduction by humans. Although most agree that assisted colonization efforts, unlike accidental introductions, should involve detailed planning and risk assessment, for some, any threat of introducing invasive species, no matter how small, disqualifies assisted colonization as a viable management response to climate change.&lt;ref name=Simberloff/&gt;

Those who wish to keep assisted colonization on the table often note that the vast majority of historical species invasions have resulted from continent-to-continent or continent-to-island transportation of species and that very few invasions have resulted from the comparatively short-distance, within-continent movement of species proposed for assisted colonization.&lt;ref name=Mueller/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sax/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoegh&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hoegh-Guldberg | first1 = O. | last2 = Hughes | first2 = L. | last3 = McIntyre | first3 = S. | last4 = Lindenmayer | first4 = D.

Terrestrial species that became invasive on the same continent where they originated were often transported across large biogeographic barriers, such as mountain ranges. These long-distance, within-continent translocations are unlike expected uses of assisted colonization, which generally involve helping species colonize habitats immediately adjacent to their current ranges.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;

===Uncertainty in the planning process===
To identify populations at risk and locate new potential habitats, conservationists often use [[Environmental niche modelling|Niche models]]. These models predict the suitability of habitats in the future based on how closely their climates resemble the climate currently inhabited by the species. Though useful for describing broad trends, these models make a number of unrealistic assumptions that restrict the usefulness of their predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dawson | first1 = T.

The uncertainties in predictions of future suitable habitat limits confidence in assisted colonization decisions and has led some to reject assisted colonization entirely.&lt;ref name=Simberloff/&gt;

Despite the uncertainty inherent in predictions of future suitable habitat, some studies have demonstrated that predictions can be quite accurate. A study of Hesperia comma butterflies in Britain identified unoccupied habitat sites that were likely to support the species under a warmer climate based on their similarity to occupied sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lawson | first1 = C.

The data suggested that the suitable, uncolonized sites could be good targets for assisted colonization. The results suggested that if investigators can demonstrate their model makes reliable predictions with real-world data, models might be trusted for informing assisted colonization decisions.

===Weighing the risks and benefits===

The science is clear that climate change will drive many species extinct, and a traditional, land-preservation ethic will not prevent extinctions.&lt;ref name=McLachlanH/&gt; Those wary of moving species instead suggest expanding networks of [[habitat corridor]]s, allowing species to naturally migrate into newly suitable areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Krosby | first1 = M. | last2 = Tewksbury | first2 = J. | last3 = Haddad | first3 = N.

Evidence suggests that slowly evolving and slowly dispersing species (including species that are dispersal-limited due to [[habitat fragmentation]]) will decline or go extinct in the absence of assisted colonization programs.&lt;ref name=Hoegh/&gt;

In their rejection of assisted colonization, Ricciardi and Simberloff cite the precautionary principle, stating that any unknown risk, no matter how small, of assisted colonization resulting in the creation of new invasive species is enough to require that it not be undertaken.&lt;ref name=Simberloff/&gt; Many scientists reject this position, however, noting that in many cases where extinctions due to climate change are likely, the risks of extinction from not facilitating colonization are probably far worse than the risks of facilitating colonization.&lt;ref name=Sax/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schwartz/&gt; They argue that the precautionary principle cuts both ways, and the risks of inaction must be compared against the risks of action. Others note that the ethics of assisting colonization will depend on the values of the stakeholders involved in a specific decision rather than the position of scientists on assisted colonization in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schlaepfer | first1 = M.

Many therefore believe we should strive to maintain biodiversity and functioning ecosystems in the face of climate change, even if it means actively moving species beyond their native ranges.&lt;ref name=Thomas2/&gt; In the absence of assisted colonization, climate change is already causing many highly mobile species, such as butterflies, to colonize areas they have not previously inhabited.&lt;ref name=Thomas2/&gt; Through assisted colonization, managers could help rare or less-mobile species keep pace, possibly preventing future extinctions due to a their inability to colonize new areas fast enough. Though some argue that nature often responds to challenges more effectively in the absence of human intervention, others note that current climate change, itself, is a human intervention.&lt;ref name=Thomas2/&gt; Many species that would have been effective dispersers under slower, natural climate change may be left behind by more mobile species under current rates of human-caused climate change. Thus, through changing the climate, humans may already be artificially segregating species even without actively relocating them.&lt;ref name=Thomas2/&gt;

Critics may also have major concerns about different genetic issues when considering assisted colonization such as maladaptation to novel environmental conditions and hybridization with similar species. These often depend on the genetic structure and level of genetic variation in the source populations. The environmental conditions in which these populations are being introduced must also be taken into account. In order to enhance genetic variation, and thus adaptive potential, material could be sourced from multiple populations. This is known as composite provenancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Broadhurst|first1=Linda|title=Seed supply for broadscale restoration: maximizing evolutionary potential|journal=Evolutionary Applications|date=4 September 2008|volume=1|issue=4|pages=587–597|doi=10.1111/j.1752-4571.2008.00045.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the environmental gradient is well known, such as predictable changes in elevation or aridity, source populations should be ‘genetically matched’ to recipient sites as best as possible to ensure that the translocated individuals ae not maladapted. This strategy of moving species beyond their current range has been suggested for those that are severely threatened or endangered. By moving them outside their native range, hopefully the immediate threats of predation, disease, and habitat loss can be avoided. However, these species are usually already suffering from some sort of genetic issue resulting from low effective population size such as inbreeding depression, loss in genetic diversity, or maladaptation. Therefore, caution must be taken with what few individuals remain and rapid population growth must be the primary goal. In the case of some species, this can be accomplished with a captive breeding program &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weeks|first1=Andrew|last2=Sgro|first2=Carla|last3=Young|first3=Andrew|last4=Frankham|first4=Richard|last5=Mitchell|first5=Nicki|last6=Byrne|first6=Margaret|last7=Coates|first7=David|last8=Eldridge|first8=Mark|last9=Sunnucks|first9=Paul|last10=Breed|first10=Martin|last11=James|first11=Elizabeth|last12=Hoffmann|first12=Ary|title=Assessing the benefits and risks of translocations in changing environments: a genetic perspective|journal=Evolutionary Applications|date=18 June 2011|volume=4|issue=6|pages=709–725|doi=10.1111/j.1752-4571.2011.00192.x|pmid=22287981|pmc=3265713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Forestry in Canada===
The British Columbia Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations has acknowledged that climate change will likely threaten the health of the millions of trees that are planted in the province every year, with potential environmental and economic consequences:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Approximately 300 million tree seedlings are planted in the western USA, British Columbia (BC) and Yukon each year. Many climatologists are predicting that the climate could be 3–4°C warmer when those trees are harvested 60-80 years after planting. These changes to climate will expose trees to increased stress and health risks, compromising the many goods and services from our forests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hre/forgen/interior/AMAT.htm British Columbia Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations--Assisted Migration Adaptation Trial]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response to this threat, the Ministry has initiated a large-scale study to determine the long-term health of seedlings of 16 tree species planted beyond their native ranges, into areas expected to become suitable due to changes in climate this century.&lt;ref name=Marris&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Marris | first1 = E. | title = Forestry: Planting the forest of the future | doi = 10.1038/459906a | journal = Nature | volume = 459 | issue = 7249 | pages = 906–908 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19536238| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results from the study will be used to develop guidelines for when and how assisted colonization of trees should be conducted.

In 2009, British Columbia also altered guidelines for selecting seeds for replanting forests after a timber harvest. Previously, foresters were required to use seeds from within 200 meters downhill and 300 meters uphill, but the new policy allows foresters to obtain seeds from up to 500 meters downhill, taking advantage of the fact that populations in warmer habitats downhill may be better adapted to the future climate of the restoration site.&lt;ref name=Marris/&gt;

Bird atlases vary in methodology but they always involve spatial (locations) and temporal (time) components. A typical bird atlas project collates data on bird presence or abundance with mapping of this information over a significant geographical region over a well-defined period of time. Data gathered in other efforts, such as [[breeding bird survey]]s and [[eBird]], may also contribute to atlas projects.&lt;ref name=dunwes/&gt;

==History==

The earliest published mapping of biodiversity in the form of an atlas was completed for the flora of Britain - Atlas of the British Flora (1962)&lt;ref&gt;Perring, F.H. &amp; Walters, S.M. (1962) Atlas of the British Flora. Botanical Society of the British Isles
&amp; T. Nelson, London.&lt;/ref&gt; The first bird atlas, the ''Atlas of breeding birds of the West Midlands'', covered Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire (England) and was published by [[HarperCollins|Collins]] for the [[West Midland Bird Club]], in 1970.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The West Midlands atlas influenced and was followed by the 1976 ''Atlas of Breeding Birds in Britain and Ireland''.&lt;ref&gt;Sharrock, J.T.R.

Kibbe (eds.). 1985. ''The atlas of breeding birds of Vermont''. Vermont Inst. of Natural Science, Woodstock,VT. 456 p.&lt;/ref&gt; In the decades that followed a number of atlases have been made all over the world and by 2008 atlases had summarised as many as 27.9 million records of birds gathered by at least 108000 contributors, over an area covering roughly 31.4% of the world's land.&lt;ref name="dunwes" /&gt; While early atlases focused on merely the presence or absence of species and evidence of their breeding, there is an increasing trend towards those that indicate abundance or relative abundance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00063650709461492|title=Mapping avian distributions: The evolution of bird atlases|journal=Bird Study|volume=54|issue=3|pages=324|year=2010|last1=Gibbons|first1=David W|last2=Donald|first2=Paul F|last3=Bauer|first3=Hans-Günther|last4=Fornasari|first4=Lorenzo|last5=Dawson|first5=Ian K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
In the oldest and most popular sampling approach, the region to be covered is gridded and volunteers are expected to visit representative locations within each grid cell and gather data that is subsequently collated. The method of collecting data, time and season in which to obtain the sample information are pre-decided as part of a protocol. In some cases the numbers and species of birds that are found to be breeding are recorded, others may use timed point sampling or transects within the grid cells to obtain quantitative estimates of abundance.&lt;ref name=dunwes/&gt; In some countries the grid cells follow the latitudes and longitudes - cell intervals of 1 degree, 30 and 15 minutes are often chosen for convenience. In higher latitudes where such an approaches leads to grid cells with large differences in area, sizes are more often fixed using grid distances of 1, 2, 5, 10 or even 50&amp;nbsp;km grid intervals.&lt;ref name=norpai&gt;Norris, Ken; Deborah J. Pain (2002) Conserving Bird Biodiversity: General Principles and Their Application. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-78949-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Oregon Breeding Bird Atlas addressed this by using hexagonal survey units, which cover a spherical surface such as the earth without changing size &lt;ref&gt;Adamus, P.R., K. Larsen, G. Gillson, and C. Miller. 2001. Oregon Breeding Bird Atlas. Oregon Field Ornithologists, Eugene, OR. CD-ROM. {{ISBN|1-877693-30-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The hexagons, each with an area of 435 square kilometers, also contained a survey unit of 25 square kilometers. A disadvantage with grids of any type is that boundaries rarely match those of habitats, making them unsuitable for ecological studies.&lt;ref name=donful/&gt; Another problem is that the data collected in one project cannot be readily reused with new grid alignments that may be needed for instance when combining information with other projects. Repeat atlases made after a decade or two have helped in identifying long term range changes.&lt;ref name=underhill&gt;{{cite book|author1=Underhill, Les |author2= D. Gibbons |year=2002|chapter=Mapping and monitoring bird populations: their conservation uses|title=Conserving Bird Biodiversity: General Principles and Their Application|editor1=Norris, Ken|editor2=Pain, Deborah J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The North American Ornithological Atlas Committee (NORAC) published English and Spanish versions of a "Handbook for Atlasing North American Breeding Birds." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bsc-eoc.org/norac/index.jsp?targetpg=atlascont|title=Handbook for Atlasing North American Breeding Birds|last=Smith|first=Charles|date=1991|website=North American Ornithological Atlas Committee|access-date=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach that does not need pre-defined grids makes use of the coordinates of individual points. Coordinates may be determined from maps or using [[GPS]] devices, and the point densities can be interpolated to generate grid or contour maps. The Summer Atlas of North American Birds (1995) is one such example that makes use of such point data (not using grids) collected by the North American Breeding Bird Surveys.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Price, Sam Droege, &amp; Amy Price (1995) The Summer Atlas of North American Birds. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-12-564660-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as the EPOQ atlas for Quebec in Canada use 'trip lists', lists of birds seen at a place on a trip.&lt;ref&gt;Cyr, Andre &amp; J Larivée (1995) L'Atlas saisonnier des oiseaux du Québec.&lt;/ref&gt; A problem in atlas projects is the unequal distribution of available observers resulting in some grid cells having too few visits. Sometimes it is possible to make corrections for the differences in the sampling effort. Reporting rates are often used as a simple quantitative indicator.&lt;ref name=norpai/&gt;

==Applications==
[[Image:CanadaGooseTrend19662003.png|thumb|Changes in abundance of [[Canada goose]] between 1966 and 2003 identified using data from the North American Breeding Bird Surveys]]
Some authors note the distinction between the published "atlas" (usually a book but sometimes are web based systems or CD-ROM as was the case for Oregon) and the actual atlas data. The data itself cannot be recovered back from published atlases for alternate applications unless made separately available as an electronic database. Depending on the methodology used, there can be multiple applications for atlas data.&lt;ref name=donful/&gt;

Atlases at a minimum, have an educational and recreational value. They provide information on the current distributions of birds and may be used by [[birdwatching|birdwatchers]] to assess the importance of their own observation records, learn more about species, or to plan trips. Distribution maps in atlases are usually far more accurate and detailed than those in field guides.&lt;ref name=donful/&gt;

Atlases document distributions and populations for conservation and research. Species distribution ranges are important in assessing conservation criteria. Patterns of sympatry and allopatry are better observed when measures of relative abundance are also collected.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, J.A. (1989). Atlassing as a tool in conservation, with special reference to the Southern African Bird Atlas Project. In: Biotic Diversity in Southern Africa: Concepts and Conservation (ed. B.J. Huntley), pp. 157-169. Oxford University Press, Cape Town.&lt;/ref&gt; When atlas projects are repeated over time it is possible to note changes in distribution. Reasons for change may be sought to identify causes when these changes are significant. Ecological niche models may be built to identify factors that are significant in influencing the occurrence of species. Many studies have examined the distributions of rare species and have noted that they often do not occur in species-rich areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/365335a0|title=Rare species, the coincidence of diversity hotspots and conservation strategies|journal=Nature|volume=365|issue=6444|pages=335|year=1993|last1=Prendergast|first1=J. R|last2=Quinn|first2=R. M|last3=Lawton|first3=J. H|last4=Eversham|first4=B. C|last5=Gibbons|first5=D. W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies using atlas data have helped in identifying key sites for conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1996.10010155.x|title=A Comparison of Richness Hotspots, Rarity Hotspots, and Complementary Areas for Conserving Diversity of British Birds|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=10|pages=155–174|year=1996|last1=Williams|first1=Paul|last2=Gibbons|first2=David|last3=Margules|first3=Chris|last4=Rebelo|first4=Anthony|last5=Humphries|first5=Chris|last6=Pressey|first6=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlas data has also been used to identify biogeographic zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2261420 |jstor=2261420 |title=An Environmentally Defined Biogeographical Zonation of Scotland Designed to Reflect Species Distributions |journal=The Journal of Ecology |volume=83 |issue=5 |pages=833 |year=1995 |last1=Carey |first1=P. D |last2=Preston |first2=C. D |last3=Hill |first3=M. O |last4=Usher |first4=M. B |last5=Wright |first5=S. M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atlases have helped in resolving taxonomic problems. DNA studies had shown that the two 'subspecies' of ''[[Eupodotis afra]]'' were distinct. The southern African atlas was able to demonstrate that these two 'subspecies' were disjunct in distribution except for a small area of overlap. The earlier distribution maps (made using what has been termed the 'shade-the-triangle' method) were totally misleading.&lt;ref name=underhill/&gt;

Atlas projects can involve several countries. The [[Southern African Bird Atlas Project]] (SABAP) was started in 1986 with data gathered from six countries: [[Botswana]], [[Lesotho]], [[Namibia]], [[South Africa]], [[Swaziland]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. This resulted in a published book form atlas in 1997 &lt;ref&gt;Harrison, J.A., Allan, D.G., Underhill, L.G., Herremans, M., Tree, A.J., Parker, V. &amp; Brown, C.J. (eds) 1997. The Atlas of Southern African birds. Vol. 1: Non-passerines. Vol. 2: Passerines. Johannesburg: BirdLife South Africa&lt;/ref&gt; and the database held seven million distribution records. It has been used by planners, conservationists, researchers and for ecotourism apart from being used in over fifty research papers and eight academic dissertations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Harrison, J.A.|author2= Underhill, L.G. |author3= Barnard, P. |year=2008|title= The seminal legacy of the Southern African Bird Atlas Project|journal= South African Journal of Science |volume=104|pages=82–84|url=http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S0038-23532008000200003&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bird atlases can also serve as a guide for more detailed research. Atlas data can be used to develop sampling and survey designs for intensive studies.&lt;ref name=donful/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17472">'''Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy''', also called Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering spectroscopy ('''CARS'''), is a form of [[spectroscopy]] used primarily in [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and related fields. It is sensitive to the same vibrational signatures of molecules as seen in [[Raman spectroscopy]], typically the nuclear vibrations of chemical bonds. Unlike Raman spectroscopy, CARS employs multiple photons to address the molecular vibrations, and produces a [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] signal. As a result, CARS is orders of magnitude stronger than spontaneous Raman emission. CARS is a third-order [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical]] process involving three [[laser]] beams: a pump beam of frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, a [[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]] beam of frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; and a probe beam at frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;pr&lt;/sub&gt;. These beams interact with the sample and generate a coherent optical signal at the [[Stokes line|anti-Stokes]] frequency (ω&lt;sub&gt;pr&lt;/sub&gt;+ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-ω&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;). The latter is resonantly enhanced when the frequency difference between the pump and the Stokes beams (ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-ω&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;) coincides with the frequency of a [[Raman resonance]], which is the basis of the technique's intrinsic [[vibrational contrast mechanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tolles |first=W.M. |last2=Nibler |first2=J.W. |last3=McDonald |first3=J.R.3 |last4=Harvey |first4=A.B. |title=A Review of the Theory and Application of Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS) |journal=Applied Spectroscopy |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=253–271 |date=1977 |doi=10.1366/000370277774463625 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/sas/sas/1977/00000031/00000004/art00001|bibcode = 1977ApSpe..31..253T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zheltikov00&gt;{{cite journal |first=A.M. |last=Zheltikov |title=Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering: from proof-of-the-principle experiments to femtosecond CARS and higher order wave-mixing generalizations |journal=Journal of Raman Spectroscopy |volume=31 |issue=8-9 |pages=653–667 |date=August–September 2000 |doi=10.1002/1097-4555(200008/09)31:8/9&lt;653::AID-JRS597&gt;3.0.CO;2-W |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/73500427/ABSTRACT|bibcode = 2000JRSp...31..653Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coherent Stokes Raman spectroscopy''' ('''CSRS''' pronounced as "scissors") is closely related to Raman spectroscopy and lasing processes. It is very similar to CARS except it uses an anti-Stokes frequency stimulation beam and a Stokes frequency beam is observed (the opposite of CARS).

==History==
In 1965, a paper was published by two researchers of the Scientific Laboratory at the [[Ford Motor Company]], P. D. Maker and R. W. Terhune, in which the CARS phenomenon was reported for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=P.D. |last=Maker |first2=R.W. |last2=Terhune |title=Study of Optical Effects Due to an Induced Polarization Third Order in the Electric Field Strength |journal=Physical Review |volume=137 |issue=3A |pages=801–818 |year=1965 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.137.A801 |url=http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v137/i3A/pA801_1|bibcode = 1965PhRv..137..801M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maker and Terhune used a pulsed ruby laser to investigate the third order response of several materials. They first passed the ruby beam of frequency ω through a [[Raman shifter]] to create a second beam at ω-ω&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, and then directed the two beams simultaneously onto the sample. When the pulses from both beams overlapped in space and time, the Ford researchers observed a signal at ω+ω&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the blue-shifted CARS signal. They also demonstrated that the signal increases significantly when the difference frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; between the incident beams matches a Raman frequency of the sample. Maker and Terhune called their technique simply 'three wave mixing experiments'. The name coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy was assigned almost ten years later, by Begley et al. at Stanford University in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=R.F. |last=Begley |first2=A.B. |last2=Harvey |first3=R.L. |last3=Byer |title=Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy |journal=Applied Physics Letters |volume=25 |issue=7 |pages=387–390 |year=1974 |doi=10.1063/1.1655519 |url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/apl/25/7/10.1063/1.1655519|bibcode = 1974ApPhL..25..387B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, this vibrationally sensitive nonlinear optical technique has been commonly known as CARS.

==Principle==
[[Image:CARS diagram.png|thumb|right|250 px|CARS energy diagram]]
The CARS process can be physically explained by using either a classical oscillator model or by using a [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] model that incorporates the energy levels of the molecule. Classically, the Raman active vibrator is modeled as a (damped) [[harmonic oscillator]] with a characteristic frequency of ω&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;. In CARS, this oscillator is not driven by a single optical wave, but by the difference frequency (ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-ω&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;) between the pump and the Stokes beams instead. This driving mechanism is similar to hearing the low combination tone when striking two different high tone piano keys: your ear is sensitive to the difference frequency of the high tones. Similarly, the Raman oscillator is susceptible to the difference frequency of two optical waves. When the difference frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-ω&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; approaches ω&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, the oscillator is driven very efficiently. On a molecular level, this implies that the electron cloud surrounding the chemical bond is vigorously oscillating with the frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-ω&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;. These electron motions alter the optical properties of the sample, i.e. there is a periodic modulation of the [[refractive index]] of the material. This periodic modulation can be probed by a third laser beam, the probe beam. When the probe beam is propagating through the periodically altered medium, it acquires the same modulation. Part of the probe, originally at ω&lt;sub&gt;pr&lt;/sub&gt; will now get modified to ω&lt;sub&gt;pr&lt;/sub&gt;+ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-ω&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the observed anti-Stokes emission. Under certain beam geometries, the anti-Stokes emission may diffract away from the probe beam, and can be detected in a separate direction.

While intuitive, this classical picture does not take into account the quantum mechanical energy levels of the molecule. Quantum mechanically, the CARS process can be  understood as follows. Our molecule is initially in the [[Stationary state|ground state]], the lowest energy state of the molecule. The pump beam excites the molecule to a virtual state. A virtual state is not an [[eigenstate]] of the molecule and it can not be occupied but it does allow for transitions between otherwise unoccupied real states. If a Stokes beam is simultaneously present along with the pump, the [[Virtual State (physics)|virtual state]] can be used as an instantaneous gateway to address a vibrational eigenstate of the molecule. The joint action of the pump and the Stokes has effectively established a coupling between the ground state and the vibrationally excited state of the molecule. The molecule is now in two states at the same time: it resides in a coherent [[Superposition principle|superposition]] of states. This coherence between the states can be probed by the probe beam, which promotes the system to a virtual state. Again, the molecule cannot stay in the virtual state and will fall back instantaneously to the ground state under the emission of a photon at the anti-Stokes frequency. The molecule is no longer in a superposition, as it resides again in one state, the ground state. In the quantum mechanical model, no energy is deposited in the molecule during the CARS process. Instead, the molecule acts like a medium for converting the frequencies of the three incoming waves into a CARS signal (a parametric process). There are, however, related coherent Raman processes that occur simultaneously which do deposit energy into the molecule.

==Comparison to Raman spectroscopy==
CARS is often compared to Raman spectroscopy as both techniques probe the same Raman active modes. Raman can be done using a single continuous wave (CW) laser whereas CARS requires (generally) two pulsed laser sources. The Raman signal is detected on the red side of the incoming radiation where it might have to compete with other fluorescent processes. The CARS signal is detected on the blue side, which is free from fluorescence, but it comes with a non-resonant contribution. 
The differences between the signals from Raman and CARS (there are many variants of both techniques) stems largely from the fact that Raman relies on a spontaneous transition whereas CARS relies on a coherently driven transition. The total Raman signal collected from a sample is the incoherent addition of the signal from individual molecules. It is therefore linear in the concentration of those molecules and the signal is emitted in all directions. The total CARS signal comes from a coherent addition of the signal from individual molecules. For the coherent addition to be additive, phase-matching must be fulfilled. For tight focusing conditions this is generally not a restriction. Once phase-matching is fulfilled the signal amplitude grows linearly with distance so that the power grows quadratically. This signal forms a collimated beam that is therefore easily collected. The fact that the CARS signal is quadratic in the distance makes it quadratic with respect to the concentration and therefore especially sensitive to the majority constituent. The total CARS signal also contains an inherent non-resonant background. This non-resonant signal can be considered as the result of (several) far off-resonance transitions that also add coherently. The resonant amplitude contains a phase shift of π radians over the resonance whereas the non-resonant part does not. The [[spectroscopic line shape]] of the CARS intensity therefore resembles a [[Fano resonance|Fano profile]] which is shifted with respect to the Raman signal. To compare the spectra from multi-component compounds, the (resonant) CARS spectral amplitude should be compared to the Raman spectral intensity. [[File:CARS spectrum.png|thumb|Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectrum of microscopy oil. &lt;br&gt; Pump beam: 800 nm; &lt;br&gt; Stokes beam: broadband from 1000 nm to 1100 nm;&lt;br&gt;anti-Stokes emission: centered  to -1250 cm{{sup|-1}} (CH{{sub|2}} groups symmetric vibration).]]

Theoretically Raman spectroscopy and CARS spectroscopy are equally sensitive as they use the same molecular transitions. However, given the limits on input power (damage threshold) and detector noise (integration time), the signal from a single transition can be collected much faster in practical situations (a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) using CARS. Imaging of known substances (known spectra) is therefore often done using CARS. 
Given the fact that CARS is a higher order nonlinear process, the CARS signal from a single molecule is larger than the Raman signal from a single molecule for a sufficiently high driving intensity. However, at very low concentrations, the advantages of the coherent addition for the CARS signal are reduced and the presence of the incoherent background becomes an increasing problem.

Since CARS is such a nonlinear process there are not really any 'typical' experimental numbers. One example is given below under the explicit warning that just changing the pulse duration by one order of magnitude changes the CARS signal by three orders of magnitude. The comparison should only be used as an indication of the order of magnitude of the signals. 200&amp;nbsp;mW average power input (CW for the Raman), in a 0.9NA objective with a center wavelength around 800&amp;nbsp;nm, constitutes a power density of 26 MW/cm,&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (focus length = 1.5 micrometre, focus volume = 1.16 micrometre&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, photon energy = 2.31×10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt; J or 1.44 eV). The Raman cross section for the vibration of the aromatic ring in Toluene around 1000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−29&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/molecule·steradian. Therefore, the Raman signal is around 26×10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; W/molecule·steradian or 3.3×10&lt;sup&gt;−21&lt;/sup&gt; W/molecule (over 4π steradians). That is 0.014 photon/sec·molecule. The density of Toluene = 0.8668×10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, Molecular mass = 92.14×10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; kg/mol. Therefore, the focal volume (~1 cubic micrometre) contains 6×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; molecules. Those molecules together generate a Raman signal in the order of 2×10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; W (20 pW) or roughly one hundred million photons/sec (over 4π steradians). A CARS experiment with similar parameters (150&amp;nbsp;mW at 1064&amp;nbsp;nm, 200&amp;nbsp;mW at 803.5&amp;nbsp;nm, 15ps pulses at 80&amp;nbsp;MHz repetition frequency, same objective lens) yields roughly 17.5×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; W (on the 3000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; line, which has 1/3 of the strength and roughly 3 times the width). This CARS power is roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; higher than the Raman but since there are 6×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; molecules, the signal per molecule from CARS is only 4×10&lt;sup&gt;−25&lt;/sup&gt; W/molecule·s or 1.7×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; photons/molecule·s. If we allow two factors of three (line strength and line width) then the spontaneous Raman signal per molecule still exceeds the CARS per molecule by more than two orders of magnitude. The coherent addition of the CARS signal from the molecules however yields a total signal that is much higher than the Raman.

The sensitivity in many CARS experiments is not limited by the detection of CARS photons but rather by the distinction between the resonant and non-resonant part of the CARS signal.

==Coherent Stokes Raman spectroscopy==
Coherent Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CSRS pronounced as "scissors") is a form of [[spectroscopy]] used primarily in [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and related fields. It is closely related to [[Raman spectroscopy]] and [[laser|lasing]] processes. It is very similar to [[Raman spectroscopy]] but involves a lasing process that dramatically improves the signal.

It is very similar to the more common CARS except it uses an anti-Stokes frequency stimulation beam and a Stokes frequency beam is observed (the opposite of CARS).&lt;ref name=Zheltikov00/&gt; This is disadvantageous because anti-stokes processes must start in a less populated excited state.

==Applications==
CARS is used for species selective microscopy and combustion diagnostics. The first exploits the selectivity of vibrational spectroscopy whereas the latter is aimed at temperature measurements; the CARS signal is temperature dependent. The strength of the signal scales (non-linearly) with the difference in the ground state population and the vibrationally excited state population. Since the population of states follows the temperature dependent [[Boltzmann Distribution]], the CARS signal carries an intrinsic temperature dependence as well. This temperature dependence makes CARS a popular technique for monitoring the temperature of hot gases and flames.  More recently, CARS has been utilized as a method for non-invasive imaging of lipids in biological samples, both ''in vivo'' and ''in vitro''. Moreover, [[Rotating-Polarization Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy|RP-CARS]], a particular implementation of the Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy microscopy, is used to study  [[myelin]] and [[myelopathy|myelopathies]].
Finally, CARS-based detectors for [[improvised explosive device|roadside bomb]]s are under development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shaped Femtosecond Pulses for Remote Chemical Detection |author1=Ori Katz |author2=Adi Natan |author3=Salman Rosenwaks |author4=Yaron Silberberg |date=December 2008 |work=OPN |publisher= |url=http://www.weizmann.ac.il/home/feyaron/PDFfiles/Standoff_OPN.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928035318/http://www.weizmann.ac.il/home/feyaron/PDFfiles/Standoff_OPN.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Laser beam 'kicks' molecules to detect roadside bombs |newspaper=[[BBC]] |date=2011-09-19 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14973447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''desert climate''' (in the [[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh'' and ''BWk'', sometimes also ''BWn''), also known as an '''arid climate''', is a climate  in which there is a excess of [[evaporation]] over [[precipitation]]. The often bald, rocky or sandy surfaces of arid climates evaporate the scanty precipitation, so that water is too low to sustain little, if any vegetation at all. 

No part of Earth is known for certain to be absolutely rainless, although in [[Arica]] in northern Chile, the average annual rainfall over a period of 17 years was only 5 mm (0.2 in.). Some locations in the [[Sahara Desert]] such as Kufra, [[Libya]] record only .86 mm (0.03 inches) of rainfall annually. The official weather station in [[Death Valley]], [[United States]] reports only 60 mm (2.3 inches) annually, and in one period between 1931 and 1934 (40 months) only 16 mm (0.64 inches) of rainfall was measured. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVO4DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT45&amp;lpg=PT45&amp;dq=arid+climate,+is+a+climate+in+which+precipitation+is+too+low+to+sustain+any+vegetation+at+all,+or+at+most+a+very+scanty+shrub,+and+does+not+meet+the+criteria+to+be+classified+as+a+polar+climate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EW3iFiCilG&amp;sig=I_h7qJ9x-8VFKkrzxWZoEKL78Us&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj9meC_hqTdAhUnsFQKHdAfD1IQ6AEwF3oECAsQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=arid%20climate&amp;f=false|title=Introduction to Geography: Earth sciences, Physical geography|last=Reviews|first=C.

Most desert and arid climates receive between 25 and 200 mm (1 to 8 inches) of rainfall annually. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Deserts and Desert Environments |first=Julie J. |last=Laity |location= |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2009 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wtAbzLLTcwcC&amp;pg=PR5 |isbn=978-1444300741 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some years experience no precipitation at all. 

There are three variations of a [[desert]] climate: a hot desert climate (''BWh''), a cold desert climate (''BWk'') and, sometimes, a mild desert climate (''BWh/BWn''). Furthermore, to delineate "hot desert climates" from "cold desert climates", there are three widely used [[Isotherm (contour line)|isotherms]]: either a mean annual temperature of 18&amp;nbsp;°C (which is the most accurate{{cn|date=May 2018}} and most commonly used), or a mean temperature of 0&amp;nbsp;°C or −3&amp;nbsp;°C in the coldest month, so that a location with a "BW" type climate with the appropriate temperature above whichever isotherm is being used is classified as "hot arid" (BWh), and a location with the appropriate temperature below the given isotherm is classified as "cold arid".

A location has an [[arid]] climate, the precipitation threshold is determined. The precipitation threshold (in millimetres) involves first multiplying the average annual temperature in °C by 20, then adding 280 if 70% or more of the total precipitation is in the high-sun half of the year (April through September in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], or October through March in the Southern), or 140 if 30–70% of the total precipitation is received during the applicable period, or 0 if less than 30% of the total precipitation is so received. If the area's annual precipitation is less than half the threshold, it is classified as a ''BW'' (desert climate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/1633/2007/hess-11-1633-2007.pdf |title=Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification |first=M.

[[File:Koppen World Map BWh.png|thumb|left|Regions with hot desert climates]]
Hot desert climates (''BWh'') are typically found under the [[subtropical ridge]] in the lower middle latitudes often between 20 and 33 north and south latitude. In these locations, stable descending air and high pressure aloft, create hot, arid, conditions with intense sunshine. Hot desert climates are generally hot, sunny and dry year-round. Hot desert climates are found across vast areas of [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], interior [[Australia]],  and smaller areas of the [[Southwestern United States]], and [[Chile]]. 

At the time of high sun (summer), scorching, desiccating heat prevails. Hot-month average temperatures are normally between 29 and 35 C (85 to 95 F), and midday readings of 43 - 46 C (110-115 F) are common.  The world absolute heat records, over 50&amp;nbsp;°C (122&amp;nbsp;°F), are generally in the hot deserts, where the heat potential is the highest on the planet. Some official records for highest surface temperatures ever recorded in hot deserts include 134 F (57 C) in [[Death Valley]], California and 136.4 F (58 C) in [[Libya]]. Some desert locations consistently experience very high temperatures all year long, even during wintertime. These locations feature some of the highest annual average temperatures recorded on Earth, averages which can exceed 30&amp;nbsp;°C (86&amp;nbsp;°F). This last feature is seen in sections of [[Africa]] and [[Arabia]]. During colder periods of the year, night-time temperatures can drop to freezing or below due to the exceptional radiation loss under the clear skies. However, very rarely do temperatures drop far below freezing.

Hot desert climates can be found in the deserts of [[North Africa]] such as the wide [[Sahara Desert]], the [[Libyan Desert]] or the [[Nubian Desert]]; deserts of the [[Horn of Africa]] such as the [[Danakil Desert]] or the [[Grand Bara|Grand Bara Desert]]; deserts of [[Southern Africa]] such as the [[Namib Desert]] or the [[Kalahari Desert]]; deserts of the [[Middle East]] such as the [[Arabian Desert]], the [[Syrian Desert]] or the [[Lut Desert]]; deserts of [[South Asia]] such as [[Dasht-e Kavir]], [[Dasht-e Loot]], or the [[Thar Desert]] of India and Pakistan; deserts of the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]] such as the [[Mojave Desert]], the [[Sonoran Desert]] or the [[Chihuahuan Desert]]; deserts of [[Australia]] such as the [[Simpson Desert]] or the [[Great Victoria Desert]] and many other regions. &lt;ref name=spainclimate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aemet.es/documentos/es/conocermas/recursos_en_linea/publicaciones_y_estudios/publicaciones/Atlas-climatologico/Atlas.pdf |title=Atlas.pdf |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hot deserts are lands of extremes: most of them are the hottest, the driest and the sunniest places on Earth because of nearly constant high pressure; the nearly permanent removal of low pressure systems, dynamic fronts and atmospheric disturbances; sinking air motion; dry atmosphere near the surface and aloft; the exacerbated exposure to the sun where solar angles are always high.

[[File:Koppen World Map BWk.png|thumb|left|Regions with cold desert climates]]
Cold desert climates (''BWk'') usually feature hot (or warm in a few instances), dry summers, though summers are not typically as hot as hot desert climates. Unlike hot desert climates, cold desert climates tend to feature cold, dry winters. Snow tends to be rare in regions with this climate. The [[Gobi Desert]] in Mongolia is a classic example for cold deserts. Though hot in the summer, it shares the very cold winters of the rest of Central Asia. Cold desert climates are typically found at higher altitudes than hot desert climates and are usually drier than hot desert climates.

Cold desert climates are typically located in temperate zones, usually in the [[rain shadow]] of high mountains, which restrict precipitation from the westerly winds. An example of this is the [[Patagonian Desert]] in Argentina bounded by the Andes to its west. In the case of Central Asia, mountains restrict precipitation from the [[monsoon]].  The [[Kyzyl Kum]], [[Taklamakan Desert|Taklamakan]] and [[Cold Desert, Skardu|Katpana Desert]] deserts of [[Central Asia]] and the drier portions of the [[Great Basin Desert]] of the western [[United States]] are other major examples of '''BWk''' climates. The [[Ladakh]] region, and [[Leh]] city in the [[Great Himalayas]] in [[India]], also has a cold desert climate. This is also found in Europe, primarily in [[Bardenas Reales]] near [[Tudela, Navarre]] and high altitude parts of the [[Tabernas Desert]] in [[Almería]], [[Spain]].

Arctic and Antarctic regions also receive very little precipitation during the year, owing to the exceptionally cold dry air; however, both of them are generally classified as having [[polar climate]]s because they have average summer temperatures below {{convert|10|°C|0}}.

In South America, this climate is found adjacent to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in sections of the [[Atacama Desert]], especially along the central and southern coast of [[Peru]]; [[Lima]], its capital, has a mild desert climate that makes it one of the driest capital cities in the world. In North America, this type of climate can be found along the Pacific coast of the [[Baja California Peninsula]]. In Africa, this climate is found along parts of coastal [[Namibia]], [[Western Sahara]] and [[Mauritania]]. In [[Asia]], this type of climate can be found along the coast of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and in [[Australia]], along the north-western coast coast of [[Western Australia]].

Mild desert climates are characterised by more moderate temperatures than encountered elsewhere at comparable latitudes (usually due to the nearby presence of cold ocean currents) and, in the case of coastal mild deserts, frequent [[Fog desert|fog]] and low clouds, despite the fact that these places can rank among the driest on Earth in terms of actual precipitation received. Temperatures are mild throughout the year, usually not subject to any of the temperature extremes typically found in desert climates. Some publications do not have a "mild desert" category; in these documents mild desert climates are sorted into either the hot desert or cold desert classifications.

'''Dispersive mass transfer''', in [[fluid dynamics]], is the spreading of mass from highly concentrated areas to less concentrated areas. It is one form of [[mass transfer]].

Dispersive mass flux is analogous to [[diffusion]], and it can also be described using [[Fick's law|Fick's first law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;J = -E \frac{dc}{dx}, &lt;/math&gt;

where c is mass concentration of the species being dispersed, E is the dispersion coefficient, and x is the position in the direction of the concentration gradient.  Dispersion can be differentiated from diffusion in that it is caused by non-ideal flow patterns (i.e. deviations from [[plug flow]]) and is a macroscopic phenomenon, whereas diffusion is caused by random molecular motions (i.e. [[Brownian motion]]) and is a microscopic phenomenon.  Dispersion is often more significant than diffusion in [[convection]]-diffusion problems.  The dispersion coefficient is frequently modeled as the product of the fluid velocity, ''U'', and some characteristic length scale, ''α'':

:&lt;math&gt;E = \alpha U.&lt;/math&gt;

The emissions decline 7.7% in 2008–2009 was at least partly influenced by the European economic recession of 2008–2009 and not only by the sustainable changes in energy consumption. From 2008 to 2009 the change in the [[Climate change in the United States|US]] was a 7.0% decline and in [[Climate change in Canada|Canada]] was a 9.6% decline.&lt;ref name=Guardianlist&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jan/31/world-carbon-dioxide-emissions-country-data-co2 World carbon dioxide emissions data by country: China speeds ahead of the rest], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 31 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A report was published in 2011 by the [[World Energy Council]] in association with [[Oliver Wyman]], entitled ''Policies for the Future: 2011 Assessment of Country Energy and Climate Policies'', which ranks country performance according to an energy sustainability index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldenergy.org/publications/3800.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120023843/http://www.worldenergy.org/publications/3800.asp |archivedate=2011-11-20 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; The best performers were Switzerland, Sweden and France.

Buildings and the residential sector currently account for 40 percent of Sweden's energy consumption. Buildings have a long life-span. Thus energy efficiency is important for houses being built. Better energy efficiency for existing buildings is the biggest challenge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energimyndigheten.se/en/About-us/Press-/News/Energy-efficiency-in-the-built-environment--new-research-and-innovation-program-initiated/ Energy efficiency in the built environment – new research and innovation program initiated], Swedish Energy Agency, 2013-02-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewable energy ==
Within the context of the European Union's 2009 [[Renewables Directive]], Sweden was working towards reaching a 49% share of renewable energy in gross final consumption of energy - electricity, heating/cooling, and transportation - by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/legislation/countries/sweden/|title= Sweden|publisher= Grantham Institute - Climate Change and Environment|date= 2015-10-30 |accessdate= 2016-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Eurostat]] reported that Sweden had already exceeded the Directive's 2020 target in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.eiu.com/industry/article/1054043489/eu-renewables-usage-shows-steady-increase/2016-03-23|title= EU renewables usage shows steady increase|publisher= Economist Intelligence Unit|date= 2016-03-16 |accessdate= 2016-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching 52.6% of total final energy consumption provided by renewables (it was just 38.7% in 2004).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
This makes Sweden the leading country within the EU-28 group in terms of renewable energy use by share, followed by [[Renewable energy in Finland|Finland]] and Latvia at 38.7%, Austria at 33.1% and [[Renewable energy in Denmark|Denmark]] on 29.2%.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7155577/8-10022016-AP-EN.pdf/38bf822f-8adf-4e54-b9c6-87b342ead339|title=Eurostat, news release, Feb 2016.|last=|first=|date=|website=Ec.europa.eu|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The two other signatories of the directive, [[Renewable energy in Iceland|Iceland]] and [[Renewable energy in Norway|Norway]], remain ahead of Sweden at 77.1% and 69.2% respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 2014 52.6% overall share of final energy consumption in Sweden breaks down as renewable energy providing the following shares to each sector: 68.1% of the heating and cooling sector, 63.3% of the electricity sector and 19.2% of the transport sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/renewable-energy/progress-reports|title=European Commission, Energy, 2015 Progress Reports, Sweden.|last=|first=|date=|website=Ec.europa.eu|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The share of renewable electricity use is high in Sweden. Hydro, wind, and solar power together accounted for 49.8% of the electricity produced in the country in 2014 (when measured against national electricity ''consumption'', however, this amount rises to 55.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scb.se/en_/Finding-statistics/Statistics-by-subject-area/Energy/Energy-supply-and-use/Annual-energy-statistics-electricity-gas-and-district-heating/Aktuell-Pong/6321/24270/|title=Electricity supply and use 2001–2014 (GWh)|date=2015-11-30|publisher=Statistics Sweden|author=Swedish Energy Agency|accessdate=2016-04-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316074708/http://www.scb.se/en_/Finding-statistics/Statistics-by-subject-area/Energy/Energy-supply-and-use/Annual-energy-statistics-electricity-gas-and-district-heating/Aktuell-Pong/6321/24270/|archivedate=2016-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2003, Sweden has supported renewable energy in the electricity sector with a "green electricity certificate" obligation for retail power suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sweden.se/society/energy-use-in-sweden/|title=Energy use in Sweden|date=2016-01-22|publisher=Swedish Institute|accessdate=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iea.org/policiesandmeasures/pams/sweden/name-21727-en.php|title=Sweden - The Electricity Certificate System|date=2014-03-11|publisher=International Energy Agency|accessdate=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current plan of the certificate system is to support 25 TWh of new renewable electricity generation by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.energimyndigheten.se/en/sustainability/the-electricity-certificate-system/|title=The Electricity Certificate System|date=2015-10-20|publisher=Swedish Energy Agency|accessdate=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, the Swedish [[Löfven Cabinet|center-left minority coalition government]] reached a cross-party energy deal with three opposition parties (the [[Moderate Party]], [[Centre Party (Sweden)]], and [[Christian Democrats (Sweden)]]), with the agreement targeting 100% renewable electricity production by 2040.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=6451006|title= Support for renewables, concessions for nuclear in energy deal|publisher= SR International – Radio Sweden|date= 2016-06-10 |accessdate= 2017-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.rechargenews.com/wind/1183427/analysis-mixed-picture-for-wind-as-sweden-plots-all-renewable-route|title= ANALYSIS: Mixed picture for wind as Sweden plots all-renewable route |author = William Steel|publisher= RECHARGE|date= 2016-06-16 |accessdate= 2017-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 renewable energy investment was more than US$1 billion in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf|title=Renewables 2014 Global Status Report, page 70|website=Ren21.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wave power ===
Sweden has a [[wave power]] station outside [[Lysekil]] run by [[Uppsala University]]. The wave energy research group at Uppsala University study and develop all different aspects of wave energy, ranging from power systems and generators, to hydrodynamical modelling, and environmental impact of [[Wave farm|wave energy parks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teknik.uu.se/electricity/research-areas/wave-power/|title=Wave Power - Department of Engineering Science|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydroelectric power ===
[[Hydroelectric power in Sweden]] accounts for more than half of energy production. More than 1900 power stations operate all over the country. Forty-five produce 100 MW and over, 17 produce 200 MW and over, and 6 produce 400 MW and over. The largest station, which is located on the upper [[Lule River]], has a maximum production capacity of 977 MW. The [[Lule River]] is also the most productive river, with almost 18% of the Swedish installed effect. Almost all of the medium to large plants are located in northern Sweden.

=== Solar power ===
While installations have historically been minimal, solar power has recently been growing quickly in Sweden with the country's cumulative [[photovoltaics|PV]] capacity nearly doubling in 2014 to 79 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://renewables.seenews.com/news/sweden-doubles-solar-power-capacity-to-79-4-mw-in-2014-470088|title=Sweden doubles solar power capacity to 79.4 MW in 2014|author=Ivan Shumkov|publisher=SeeNews|date=2015-03-26|accessdate=2015-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capacity rose further to 205 MW at the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/index.php?id=93&amp;eID=dam_frontend_push&amp;docID=4075|title=National Survey Report of PV Power Applications in Sweden - 2016|author=Johan Lindahl|publisher=International Energy Agency - Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme|page=8|date=2017-10-10|accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar power accounts for roughly 0.2% of the nation's total electricity consumption as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.iea-pvps.org/index.php?id=93&amp;eID=dam_frontend_push&amp;docID=4497 |title= National Survey Report of PV Power Applications in Sweden 2017|page= 16/70|publisher= International Energy Agency - Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme|date= 2018-10-15 |accessdate= 2018-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biofuels ===
{{See|Biofuel in Sweden}}
Sweden aims for a fossil fuel free vehicle fleet by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf|title=Renewables 2014 Global Status Report, page 29|website=Ren21.net|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden published the sustainability criteria for biofuels (2011) which consider the areas with high biological values to be protected in respect to fuels production. The feedstock origin used for production of bioliquids in Sweden during 2011 was Sweden 49% The Netherlands 17% United States 17% Finland 6% Belgium 3% and other 8% (Brazil, Malaysia and Russia). [[Palm oil]] is often pointed out as a dirty feed-stock for biofuels. None of the Swedish companies used palm oil in 2011. The largest share of feedstock for bioliquids comes from the forest industry in the form of [[tall oil pitch]], [[tall oil]] and [[methanol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webbshop.cm.se/System/TemplateView.aspx?p=Energimyndigheten&amp;view=default&amp;id=d65a3a4ad33e41149788fbe65756471b|title=Sustainable bioliquids 2011|website=Webbshop.cm.se|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the bus fleets in more than a dozen cities relied entirely on biomethane, local plants produced more than 60% of
the total biomethane used in Swedish natural gas vehicles, and more filling stations were opened in 2012 and 2013. Goteborg Energi (Gothenburg Energy) has a 20 MW facility that gasifies forest residues and then converts the synthesis gases—hydrogen and carbon monoxide—into biomethane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf|title=Renewables 2014 Global Status Report, page 35+37|website=Ren21.net|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thermal and nuclear ==
Nuclear is dominating in this sector. The other operational plant is, in almost all cases, fueled with renewable fuels. Oil plants are few, and are either decommissioned or used as a reserve,

=== Nuclear power ===
{{main|Nuclear power in Sweden}}

More than 35% of the Swedish electricity is produced by 10 [[nuclear reactor]]s, spread out on three power stations:
* [[Ringhals Nuclear Power Plant]] - 3 [[Pressurized water reactor|Pressurized Water Reactor]], 1 [[BWR|Boiling Water Reactor]], ~4,2 [[Watt|GW]]
* [[Oskarshamn Nuclear Power Plant]] - 3 BWRs (One of them is also world's largest BWR), ~2,6 GW
* [[Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant]] - 3 BWRs, ~3,2 GW

Before 2005, there were 12 reactors, but the two BWR reactors (~1,2 GW) at the [[Barsebäck nuclear power plant]] were decommissioned in 1999 and 2005.

== Global warming ==
{{Main|Climate change in Sweden}}
According to Energy Information Administration the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from energy consumption of Sweden were in 2009 54.77 Mt, slightly below [[Energy in Finland|Finland]] 54.86 Mt, despite the difference in population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jan/31/world-carbon-dioxide-emissions-country-data-co2  World carbon dioxide emissions data by country: China speeds ahead of the rest], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 31 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The emissions per capita were in Sweden 5.58 and in Finland 9.93 tonnes per capita in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jan/31/world-carbon-dioxide-emissions-country-data-co2 world carbon dioxide emissions country data co2], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 31 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ficus religiosa''''' or '''sacred fig''' is a species of [[Ficus|fig]] native to the [[Indian subcontinent]]&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Peepul|volume=21|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Indochina]]&lt;ref name="GRIN"&gt;{{GRIN | name = ''Ficus religiosa'' | accessdate = 29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that belongs to ''[[Moraceae]]'', the fig or mulberry family. It is also known as the '''bodhi tree''',&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, 1971, p. 1014&lt;/ref&gt; '''pippala tree''', '''peepul tree''',&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; '''peepal tree''' or '''ashwattha tree''' (in India and Nepal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Peepal.html|title=Ficus religiosa&amp;nbsp;— Peepal|publisher=Flowers of India|accessdate=November 3, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214150730/http://www.flowersofindia.in/catalog/slides/Peepal.html|archivedate=February 14, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sacred fig is considered to have a religious significance in three major religions that originated on the Indian subcontinent, [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]]. It is the type of tree that [[Gautama Buddha]] is believed to have attained enlightenment under, and Hindu and Jain ascetics also consider the tree to be sacred and often meditate under them. 

==Description==
''Ficus religiosa'' is a large [[dry season]]-[[deciduous]] or semi-[[evergreen]] tree up to {{convert|30|m|ft}} tall and with a [[tree trunk|trunk]] diameter of up to {{convert|3|m|ft}}. The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[Wiktionary:cordate|cordate]] in shape with a distinctive extended [[Glossary of botanical terms#D|drip tip]]; they are {{convert|10|-|17|cm}} long and {{convert|8|–|12|cm}} broad, with a {{convert|6|–|10|cm}} [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]]. The [[fruit]]s are small figs {{convert|1|–|1.5|cm}} in diameter, green ripening to purple. 

''F.&amp;nbsp;religiosa'' is a tree having a very long [[lifespan]], with an average life ranging between 900–1,500 years. At some of its [[Native species|native]] [[habitat]]s, it has been reportedly found living for over 3,000 years.&lt;ref name=CABI&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/24168 |title=''Ficus religiosa'' (sacred fig tree) |website=[[Invasive Species Compendium]] |publisher=[[Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International|CABI]] |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some trees have been reported to be more than 2,000 years old, like the '''Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi''', a peepul tree in the ancient city of [[Anuradhapura]] in [[Sri Lanka]] which is estimated to be more than 2,250 years old and is regarded as the "Oldest historical tree in the world with religious importance".&lt;ref name=Medium&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/@StephenJForbes/the-oldest-historical-tree-in-the-world-566fcee32605 |title=The oldest historical tree in the world |website=medium.com |publisher=Medium |author=Stephen Forbes |date=25 December 2016 |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
''Ficus religiosa'' is native to [[Tropical Asia|tropical Asia]], but it has now been [[Introduced species|introduced]], [[Species distribution|spread]] and [[Horticulture|cultivated]] around much of the world, and in some cases it has become [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] where its specialist [[pollinator]] wasp ([[Fig wasp|Blastophaga quadriceps]]) has also been introduced.

===Asia===

[[File:Ficus Religiosa In Delhi.jpg|thumb|A mature tree at a roadside in Delhi, India]]

''Ficus religiosa'' is a [[Indigenous (ecology)|species native]] to the Indian subcontinent and South-East Asian countries such as [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[China]] ([[Yunnan|Yunnan province]]), [[India]] (all states except [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]), [[Laos]] , [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]], [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]]. It was initially introduced to [[Sri Lanka]] in 288 BCE and later to other neighbouring [[Asia]]n countries like [[Philippines]] and [[Singapore]]. In Philippines, it was introduced at an early date and now has become widespread throughout the country. Sacred Fig was unintentionally introduced to [[Israel]] because of [[horticulture]] practices and its associated pollinator wasp was also present in the country by the 1960s, which led to its [[Species distribution|widespread distribution]].&lt;ref name=CABI/&gt;

===Africa===
In [[Africa]], ''F.&amp;nbsp;religiosa'' is a native species of [[Chad]].&lt;ref name=CABI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Agroforestry&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldagroforestry.org/treedb/AFTPDFS/Ficus_religiosa.PDF |title=''Ficus religiosa'' |website=worldagroforestry.org |publisher=[[World Agroforestry Centre]] |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distributed in [[Egypt]] and [[Madagascar]] where it is cultivated, and [[Libya]] where it was introduced and now cultivated.&lt;ref name=CABI/&gt;

===North America===
In [[North America]], ''F.&amp;nbsp;religiosa'' is distributed only in [[Mexico]] and 3 states of the [[United States]] where it is cultivated. [[California]], [[Florida]] and [[Hawaii]] are the only [[List of states and territories of the United States|states]] to have a known distribution of the species.&lt;ref name=CABI/&gt;

===Central America and Caribbean===
In Central America and Caribbean, the species is distributed in [[Costa Rica]], [[Cuba]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Haiti]], [[Jamaica]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], [[Puerto Rico]]. It was most probably brought to these countries from Indian subcontinent in late [[19th century|19th]] or early [[20th century]] during the [[British Empire]]. In Nicaragua and Panama, it is only found in cultivation.&lt;ref name=CABI/&gt;

===South America===
In [[South America]], the species is distributed in [[Colombia]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Venezuela]]. In Colombia, it is only found in cultivation while in Paraguay, it is cultivated as well as also occurring in forests at lower altitudes.&lt;ref name=CABI/&gt;

===Oceania===
In [[Oceania]], the species is distributed in the [[Australia]]n state of [[New South Wales]] where it has been naturalised after regional distribution, [[Fiji]] where it is cultivated, [[Mariana Islands]] (Guam), [[Northern Mariana Islands]] (Tinian Is.) and [[New Caledonia]].&lt;ref name=CABI/&gt;

==Ecology==
''Ficus religiosa'' suitably grows at [[Altitude|altitudes]] ranging from {{convert|10|m|ft}} up to {{convert|1520|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=Agroforestry/&gt; Due to the [[Climate|climatic conditions]] which are prevalent throughout different heat zones, it can grow at [[Latitude|latitudes]] ranging from 30°N to 5°S. It can tolerate [[temperature|air temperatures]] ranging between {{convert|0|°C|°F}} to {{convert|35|°C|°F}}, beyond this upper limit its growth diminishes.  It grows on a wide [[Soil type|variety of soils]] but preferably needs deep, [[Alluvium|alluvial]] [[sand]]y [[loam]] with good [[drainage]]. It is also found on shallow soils including rock crevices.&lt;ref name=Agroforestry/&gt;

===Association===
''Ficus religiosa'' is associated with [[Fig wasp|Blastophaga quadriceps]], an [[Agaonidae|agaonid wasp]] which acts as its [[pollinator]] as this wasp lays its [[egg]]s only on trees of this species.

===Environment===
''Ficus religiosa'' is tolerant to various climate zones ([[Köppen climate classification]] categories of [[Tropical rainforest climate|Af]], [[Tropical monsoon climate|Am]], [[Tropical savanna climate|Aw/As]], [[Humid subtropical climate|Cfa]], [[Humid subtropical climate|Cwa]] and [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate|Csa]]) and various types of soils. In Paraguay the tree species occurs in forests at lower elevations, and in China the species has been reported growing at altitudes ranging from {{convert|400|m|ft}} to {{convert|700|m|ft}}. In India, being a [[Indigenous (ecology)|native species]], it occurs both naturally in wild as well as cultivated up to altitudes of {{convert|1520|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=CABI/&gt;

===Climate===
''Ficus religiosa'' is tolerant to widely varying climatic conditions such as [[Tropical rainforest climate]] where the region receives more than {{convert|60|mm|cm}} of [[precipitation]] per month, [[Tropical monsoon climate]] where average precipitation ranges from {{convert|60|mm|cm}} in the driest month to {{convert|100|mm|cm}}, [[Tropical savanna climate|Tropical savanna climate with dry summer]] where average precipitation ranges from {{convert|60|mm|cm}} per month in [[summer]]s to {{convert|100|mm|cm}} per month in [[winter]]s, [[Temperate climate|Warm temperate climate, wet all year]] where average temperature ranges from {{convert|0|°C|°F}} to {{convert|10|°C|°F}} and it is wet all year, as well as [[Temperate climate|Warm temperate climate with dry summer]] where average temperature ranges from {{convert|0|°C|°F}} to {{convert|10|°C|°F}} and summers are dry.

[[File:Peepul Tree In Wall.jpg|thumb|170px| A young tree growing on a [[concrete]] wall in [[Delhi]]. It is tolerant to wide variety of soils, and hence it even thrives on concrete walls having little moisture.]]

===Invasiveness===

''Ficus religiosa'' has been listed as an "[[Weed|environmental weed]]" or "naturalised weed" by the Global Compendium of Weeds (Randall, 2012). It has been assigned an invasiveness high risk score of 7 in a risk assessment prepared for the species' invasiveness in [[Hawaii]] by PIER. Such a high score predicts it will become a major pest in suitable climate zones. The major reasons for its invasive behaviour are its fast-growing nature, tolerance to various climate zones and soil types, reported [[lifespan]] of over 3,000 years, and its suffocating growth habit as it often begins life as an [[Epiphyte|epiphyte]].&lt;ref name=Medium/&gt;

==In religion==
The ''Ficus religiosa'' tree is considered sacred by the followers of [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]].  In the [[Bhagavad Gita]], Krishna says, "I am the Peepul tree among the trees, Narada among the sages, Chitraaratha among the [[Gandharvas]], And sage [[Kapila]] among the Siddhas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santosha.com/philosophy/gita-chapter10.html|title=The Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 10 - The Yoga of Manifestation|work=santosha.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Bodhi tree}}
[[File:Maha_Bodhi_tree_2.jpg|thumb|The [[Bodhi Tree]] at the [[Mahabodhi Temple]]. Propagated from the Sri Maha Bodhi, which in turn is propagated from the original Bodhi Tree at this location.]]
[[Gautama Buddha]] attained [[bodhi|enlightenment]] (''bodhi'') while meditating underneath a ''Ficus religiosa''. The site is in present-day [[Bodh Gaya]] in Bihar, [[India]]. The original tree was destroyed, and has been replaced several times.  A branch of the original tree was rooted in [[Anuradhapura]], [[Sri Lanka]] in 288 BCE and is known as [[Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi]]; it is the oldest [[flowering plant]] (angiosperm) in the world.&lt;ref name="RMTRR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmtrr.org/oldlist.htm|title=Rocky Mountain Tree-Ring Research, OLDLIST|accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Theravada Buddhist]] [[Southeast Asia]], the tree's massive trunk is often the site of Buddhist or [[animist]] shrines. Not all ''Ficus religiosa'' can be called a ''Bodhi Tree''. A Bodhi Tree must be able to trace its parent to another Bodhi Tree and the line goes on until the first Bodhi Tree under which [[Gautama]] is said to have gained enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Bo-Tree |volume=4 |page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
[[File:ആൽമരം 01.JPG|thumb|Typical example of aerial roots]] 
[[File:Ficus religiosa (Peepal tree) grow on a bare wall.jpg|thumb|Growing on a bare wall]]
[[Sadhu]]s ([[Hindu]] ascetics) still meditate beneath sacred fig trees, and Hindus do [[pradakshina]] (circumambulation, or meditative pacing) around the sacred fig tree as a mark of worship. Usually seven pradakshinas are done around the tree in the morning time chanting "''vriksha rajaya namah''", meaning "salutation to the king of trees." It claimed that the 27 stars (constellations) constituting 12 houses (''rasis'') and 9 planets are specifically represented precisely by 27 trees—one for each star. The Bodhi Tree is said to represent [[Pushya]] (Western star name γ, δ and θ Cancri in the Cancer constellation).{{clear|left}}

''Plaksa'' is a possible Sanskrit term for ''Ficus religiosa''. However, according to [[Arthur Anthony Macdonell|Macdonell]] and [[Arthur Berriedale Keith|Keith]] (1912), it denotes the wavy-leaved fig tree (''[[Ficus infectoria]]'') instead. In Hindu texts, the Plaksa tree is associated with the source of the [[Sarasvati River]]. The ''[[Skanda Purana]]'' states that the Sarasvati originates from the water pot of [[Brahma]]  flows from Plaksa on the [[Himalayas]]. According to [[Vamana Purana]] 32.1-4, the Sarasvati was rising from the Plaksa tree (Pipal tree).&lt;ref&gt;D.S. Chauhan in Radhakrishna, B.P. and Merh, S.S. (editors): Vedic Sarasvati, 1999, p. 35–44&lt;/ref&gt; ''Plaksa Pra-sravana'' denotes the place where the Sarasvati appears.&lt;ref&gt;Pancavimsa Brahmana, Jaiminiya Upanisad Brahmana, Katyayana Srauta Sutra, Latyayana Srauta; Macdonell and Keith 1912&lt;/ref&gt; In the Rigveda Sutras, Plaksa Pra-sravana refers to the source of the Sarasvati.&lt;ref&gt;Asvalayana Srauta Sutra, Sankhayana Srauta Sutra; Macdonell and Keith 1912, II:55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==
''Ficus religiosa'' is grown by  specialty tree [[plant nursery|plant nurseries]] for use as an [[ornamental tree]], in [[garden]]s and [[park]]s in tropical and [[subtropical climate]]s. Peepul trees are native to Indian subcontinent and thrive in hot, [[Humidity|humid]] weather. They prefer full [[Sunlight|sunlight]] and can grow in most [[Soil type|soil types]], though [[Loam|loam]] is the best. When planting, use soil with a [[pH]] of 7 or below. While it is possible for the plant to grow indoors in a pot, it grows best outside. Young peepul needs [[Plant nutrition|proper nourishment]]. It requires full sunlight and proper watering. Sacred fig occurs naturally in [[Montane ecosystems|submontane forest regions]]. 

In the [[Middle East]], it is preferably planted as an [[Avenue (landscape)|avenue]] or [[Road verge|road verge]] tree. In the [[Philippines]] and in [[Nicaragua]] the species is cultivated in [[Park|parks]] and along roadsides and [[Sidewalk|pavements]], while in [[Paraguay]] it occurs in [[Forest|forests]] at lower [[Elevation|elevations]].&lt;ref name=CABI/&gt;

==Uses==
''Ficus religiosa'' is used in [[traditional medicine]]  for about 50 types of disorders including asthma, diabetes, diarrhea, epilepsy, gastric problems, inflammatory disorders, infectious and sexual disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T8D-523CDP7-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=04%2F12%2F2011&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=gateway&amp;_origin=gateway&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=b28956819f4c2a37db22414cbf670516&amp;searchtype=a|title=Journal of Ethnopharmacology : Traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology of Ficus religiosa: A review|author=Damanpreet Singh|author2=Bikram Singh|author3=Rajesh Kumar Goela|journal=[[Journal of Ethnopharmacology]]|publisher=ScienceDirect|volume=134|issue=3|pages=565–583|date=April 12, 2011|doi=10.1016/j.jep.2011.01.046|pmid=21296646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[igneous petrology]], '''flux melting''' occurs when water and other volatile components are added to hot solid rock. In engineering and metallurgy, [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]] is a substance, such as salt, that produces a low melting point mixture with a metal oxide. In the same way, the addition of water and other volatile compounds to rocks composed of [[silicate minerals]] lowers the melting temperature of those rocks.

In subduction zones, the [[ultramafic rock]] of the [[upper mantle]] is melted by the addition of [[Volatiles#Igneous petrology|volatiles]] from the down-going plate. The subducting slab of [[oceanic crust]] carries water and other volatiles into the mantle, where these volatiles are released by metamorphic dewatering into the overlying [[mantle wedge]]. The partial melting triggered by the incorporation of volatiles produces [[mafic]] [[magma]] which rises and [[igneous differentiation|differentiates]] forming the [[Igneous rock|igneous]] and [[volcanic rock]]s of the overlying [[volcanic arc]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Paul J., ''Volatiles in subduction zone magmas: concentrations and fluxes based on melt inclusion and volcanic gas data,'' Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research 140 (2005) pp. 217– 240 &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''global spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza''' in [[bird]]s is considered a significant [[Influenza pandemic|pandemic]] threat.

While other [[H5N1]] influenza &lt;ref&gt;http://www.yangtse.com/epaper/yzwb/2007-06/28/content_9354072.htm&lt;/ref&gt; strains are known, they are significantly different from a current, highly pathogenic H5N1 strain on a genetic level, making the global spread of this new strain unprecedented. The H5N1 strain is a [[Mutation|fast-mutating]], highly [[pathogen]]ic [[avian influenza]] virus (HPAI) found in multiple bird species. It is both epizootic (an epidemic in non-humans) and panzootic (a disease affecting animals of many species especially over a wide area). Unless otherwise indicated, "H5N1" in this [[timeline]] refers to the recent highly pathogenic strain of H5N1.

"Since 1997, studies of H5N1 influenza indicate that these viruses continue to evolve, with changes in antigenicity and internal [[gene]] constellations; an expanded host range in avian species and the ability to infect [[Felidae|felids]]; enhanced pathogenicity in experimentally infected [[mouse|mice]] and ferrets, in which they cause systemic infections; and increased environmental stability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{H5N1 case graph}}
Tens of millions of birds have died of [[H5N1]] influenza and hundreds of millions of birds have been slaughtered and disposed of, to limit the spread of H5N1. Countries that have reported one or more major highly pathogenic H5N1 outbreaks in birds (causing at least thousands but in some cases millions of dead birds) are (in order of first outbreak occurrence): [[South Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[Japan]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Indonesia]], [[China]], [[Malaysia]], [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Turkey]], [[Romania]], [[Croatia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Cyprus]], [[Iraq]], [[Nigeria]], [[Egypt]], [[India]], [[France]], [[Niger]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Albania]], [[Cameroon]], [[Myanmar]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Israel]], [[Pakistan]], [[Jordan]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Germany]], [[Sudan]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Djibouti]], [[Hungary]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Ghana]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Togo]], [[Nepal]], and [[Bhutan]].

{{H5N1}}
Highly pathogenic H5N1 has been found in birds in the wild in numerous other countries: [[Austria]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Denmark]], [[Greece]], [[Iran]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]], [[Serbia and Montenegro]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], and [[Switzerland]]. Surveillance of [[H5N1]] in humans, poultry, wild birds, cats and other animals remains very weak in many parts of Asia and Africa. Much remains unknown about the exact extent of its spread.

H5N1 has low pathogenic varieties [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in [[bird]]s in North America. H5N1 has a highly pathogenic variety that is endemic in dozens of species of birds throughout south [[Asia]] and parts of [[Africa]]. So far, it is very difficult for [[human]]s to become infected with H5N1. The presence of highly pathogenic (deadly) H5N1 around the world in both birds in the wild ([[swan]]s, [[magpie]]s, [[duck]]s, [[geese]], [[pigeon]]s, [[eagle]]s, etc.) and in [[chicken]]s and [[turkey (bird)|turkeys]] on farms has been demonstrated in millions of cases with the [[virus]] isolate actually [[Sequencing|sequenced]] in hundreds of cases yielding definitive proof of the [[evolution]] of this strain of this subtype of the species [[Influenzavirus A]] (bird flu virus).

According to [[Robert G. Webster]]:
{{quote|The epicenters of both the [[H2N2#Asian flu|Asian influenza pandemic]] of 1957 and the [[H3N2#Hong Kong Flu|Hong Kong influenza pandemic]] of 1968 were in Southeast Asia, and it is in this region that multiple clades of H5N1 influenza virus have already emerged. The Asian H5N1 virus was first detected in [[Guangdong Province]], China, in 1996, when it killed some geese, but it received little attention until it spread through live-poultry markets in Hong Kong to humans in May 1997, killing 6 of 18 infected people. [...] From 1997 to May 2005, H5N1 viruses were largely confined to Southeast Asia, but after they had infected wild birds in Qinghai Lake, China, they rapidly spread westward. [...] The intermittent spread to humans will continue, and the virus will continue to evolve.[http://content.nejm.org/content/vol355/issue21/images/large/03f1.jpeg Map]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

As of the July 25, 2008 [[FAO]] Avian Influenza Disease Emergency Situation Update, H5N1 [[pathogenicity]] is continuing to gradually rise in endemic areas but the avian influenza disease situation in farmed birds is being held in check by vaccination. Eleven outbreaks of H5N1 were reported worldwide in June 2008 in five countries (China, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam) compared to 65 outbreaks in June 2006 and 55 in June 2007.

* A highly pathogenic strain of [[H5N1]] caused [[flu]] outbreaks with significant spread to numerous farms, resulting in great economic losses in 1959 in [[Scotland]] in [[chicken]]s and in 1991 in [[England]] in [[turkey (bird)|turkey]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These strains were somewhat similar to the current pathogenic strain of H5N1 in two of its ten genes, the gene that causes it to be type H5 and the gene that causes it to be N1. The other genes can and have been [[reassortment|reassorted]] from other subtypes of the bird flu species (their ease at exchanging genes is part of what makes them all one species). [[Evolution]] by reassortment of H5N1 from 1999 to 2002 created the Z genotype which became the dominant strain of highly pathogenic H5N1 in 2004 and is now spreading across the entire world in both wild and domestic birds.

===2004===
{{main|Global spread of H5N1 in 2004}}

In January 2004 a major new outbreak of [[H5N1]] surfaced in [[Vietnam]] and [[Thailand]]'s [[poultry]] industry, and within weeks spread to ten countries and regions in [[Asia]], including [[Indonesia]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[China]]. In October 2004 researchers discovered [[H5N1]] is far more dangerous than previously believed because [[waterfowl]], especially [[duck]]s, were directly spreading the highly pathogenic strain of [[H5N1]] to [[chicken]]s, [[crow]]s, [[pigeon]]s, and other birds and that it was increasing its ability to infect mammals as well. From this point on, [[avian influenza]] experts increasingly refer to containment as a strategy that can delay but not prevent a future avian flu pandemic.

===2005===
[[Image:Avian influenza spread map.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The spread of avian influenza in the eastern hemisphere.]]
{{main|Global spread of H5N1 in 2005}}

In January 2005 an outbreak of avian influenza affected thirty three out of sixty four cities and provinces in [[Vietnam]], leading to the forced killing of nearly 1.2 million poultry. Up to 140 million birds are believed to have died or been killed because of the outbreak. In April 2005 there begins an unprecedented die-off of over 6,000 migratory birds at [[Qinghai Lake]] in central [[China]] over three months. This strain of H5N1 is the same strain as is spread west by migratory birds over at least the next ten months. In August 2005 H5N1 spread to [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Russia]]. On September 29, 2005, [[David Nabarro]], the newly appointed Senior United Nations System Coordinator for Avian and Human Influenza, warned the world that an outbreak of avian influenza could kill 5 to 150 million people. David Nabarro later stated that as the virus had spread to migratory birds, an outbreak could start in [[Africa]] or the [[Middle East]]. Later in 2005 H5N1 spread to [[Turkey]], [[Romania]], [[Croatia]] and [[Kuwait]].

===2006===
{{main|Global spread of H5N1 in 2006}}
* In the first two months of 2006 H5N1 spread to other [[Asia]]n countries (such as [[Bird flu in India|India]]), north [[Africa]], and [[Europe]] in wild bird populations possibly signaling the beginning of [[H5N1]] being endemic in wild migratory bird populations on multiple continents for decades, permanently changing the way [[poultry]] are [[farm]]ed.
* By April 2006 scientists had concluded that containment had failed due to the role of wild [[bird]]s in transmitting the virus and were now emphasizing far more comprehensive risk mitigation and management measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In June 2006 [[WHO]] predicted an upsurge in human deaths due to H5N1 during late 2006 or early 2007 following a summer/fall lull in most countries, as H5N1 appears to be somewhat seasonal in nature. In July and August 2006 significantly increased numbers of bird deaths due to H5N1 were recorded in [[Cambodia]], [[China]], [[Laos]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Thailand]] while continuing unabated a rate unparalleled in [[Indonesia]].
* In June, there was a human outbreak in Indonesia when 8 members of a family in [[Sumatra]] became infected and 7 died. The WHO reported that this may have been the first recorded instance of human-to-human transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - Protecting Poultry Workers from Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) (2008-128)|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2008-128/|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In September, [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] joined the list of nations seeing a resurgence of bird deaths due to H5N1.
* In November and December, [[South Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] joined the list of nations seeing a resurgence of bird deaths due to H5N1.

===2007===
{{main|Global spread of H5N1 in 2007}}
In January, [[Japan]], [[Hungary]], [[Russia]], and the [[United Kingdom]] joined the list of nations seeing a resurgence of bird deaths due to H5N1. In February, [[Pakistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Myanmar]] joined the list and [[Kuwait]] saw its first major outbreak of [[H5N1]] [[avian influenza]].

In March [[Bangladesh]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] each saw their first major outbreak of [[H5N1]] [[avian influenza]] and [[Ghana]] in May.

As H5N1 continued killing many birds and a few people throughout the spring in countries where it is now endemic, in June [[Malaysia]] and [[Germany]] saw a resurgence of bird deaths due to H5N1, while the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Togo]] experienced their first major outbreak of [[H5N1]] [[avian influenza]].

In July [[France]] and [[India]] also saw a resurgence of bird deaths due to H5N1.

As of the July 25, 2008 [[FAO]] Avian Influenza Disease Emergency Situation Update, H5N1 [[pathogenicity]] is continuing to gradually rise in wild birds in endemic areas but the avian influenza disease situation in farmed birds is being held in check by vaccination. Eleven outbreaks of H5N1 were reported worldwide in June 2008 in five countries (China, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam) compared to 65 outbreaks in June 2006 and 55 in June 2007. The "global HPAI situation can be said to have

Over 150 chickens died in the Indian border town, 35&amp;nbsp;km southwest of Kankarbhitta. The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives declared the area surrounding Sharanamati a "bird-flu affected area" and increased surveillance along the border. A Rapid Response Team (RRT) was dispatched to control the virus. The government also banned the transportation of poultry products throughout the country. The first outbreak was confirmed in Kankarbhitta on January 16. 28,000 chickens were killed in the area to control the virus. Earlier, Agriculture Minister Jayprakash Gupta asked the international community and donor agencies to provide help to Nepal fight the disease.

Avian influenza virus [[H3N2]] is endemic in [[pig]]s ("[[swine flu]]") in [[China]] and has been detected in pigs in Vietnam, increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. Health experts say pigs can carry human [[influenza]] viruses, which can combine (i.e. exchange homologous genome sub-units by genetic [[reassortment]]) with [[H5N1]], passing [[gene]]s and mutating into a form which can pass easily among humans. [[H3N2]] evolved from [[H2N2]] by [[antigenic shift]] and caused the [[Hong Kong Flu]] pandemic of 1968 and 1969 that killed up to 750,000 humans. The dominant strain of annual [[flu]] in humans in January 2006 is [[H3N2]]. Measured resistance to the standard antiviral drugs [[amantadine]] and [[rimantadine]] in H3N2 in humans has increased to 91% in 2005. A combination of these two subtypes of the species known as the [[avian influenza]] virus in a country like [[China]] is a worst-case scenario. In August 2004, researchers in [[China]] found [[H5N1]] in pigs.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;

In 2005, it was discovered that [[H5N1]] "could be infecting up to half of the pig population in some areas of [[Indonesia]], but without causing symptoms [...] Chairul Nidom, a virologist at [[Airlangga University]]'s tropical disease center in [[Surabaya]], Java, was conducting independent research earlier this year. He tested the blood of 10 apparently healthy pigs housed near poultry farms in western Java where avian flu had broken out, ''Nature'' reported. Five of the pig samples contained the H5N1 virus. The Indonesian government has since found similar results in the same region, Nature reported. Additional tests of 150 pigs outside the area were negative."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/news/may2705avflu.html CIDRAP] article ''Indonesian pigs have avian flu virus; bird cases double in China'' published May 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Felidae'' (cats)==
[[Image:Cat03.jpg|thumb|right|Domestic cats can get H5N1 from eating birds, and can transmit it to other cats and possibly to people.]]

"In Bangkok, [[Thailand]], all the cats in one household are known to have died of [[H5N1]] in 2004. [[Tiger]]s and [[leopard]]s in Thai [[zoo]]s also died, while in 2007 two cats near an outbreak in poultry and people in [[Iraq]] were confirmed to have died of H5N1, as were three [[Germany|German]] cats that ate wild birds. In [[Austria]], cats were infected but remained healthy". Cats in [[Indonesia]] were also found to have been infected with H5N1.&lt;ref name="Chairul Nidom"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19325883.800-deadly-h5n1-may-be-brewing-in-cats.html New Scientist] article ''Deadly H5N1 may be brewing in cats'' published January 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread to more and more types and populations of birds and the ability of [[felidae]] (cats) to catch [[H5N1]] from eating this natural prey means the creation of a reservoir for H5N1 in cats where the virus can adapt to mammals is one of the many possible pathways to a [[pandemic]].

===August 2006===
It was announced in the August 2006 CDC EID journal that while literature describing HPAI H5N1 infection in cats had been limited to a subset of clade I viruses; a Qinghai-like virus (they are genetically distinct from other clade II viruses) killed up to five cats and 51 chickens from February 3 to 5, 2006 in Grd Jotyar (~10&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Arbil|Erbil City]], Iraq). Two of the cats were available for examination.

:"An influenza A H5 virus was present in multiple organs in all species from the outbreak site in Grd Jotyar (Table). cDNA for sequencing was amplified directly from RNA extracts from pathologic materials without virus isolation. On the basis of sequence analysis of the full HA1 gene and 219 amino acids of the HA2 gene, the viruses from the goose and 1 cat from Grd Jotyar and from the person who died from Sarcapcarn (sequence derived from PCR amplification from first-passage egg material) are &gt;99% identical at the nucleotide and amino acid levels (GenBank nos. DQ435200–02). Thus, no indication of virus adaptation to cats was found. The viruses from Iraq are most closely related to currently circulating Qinghai-like viruses, but when compared with A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/65/2005 (H5N1) (GenBank no. DQ095622), they share only 97.4% identity at the nucleic acid level with 3 amino acid substitutions of unknown significance. On the other hand, the virus from the cat is only 93.4% identical to A/tiger/Thailand/CU-T4/2004(H5N1) (GenBank no. AY972539). These results are not surprising, given that these strains are representative of different clades (8,9). Sequencing of 1,349 bp of the N gene from cat 1 and the goose (to be submitted to GenBank) show identity at the amino acid level, and that the N genes of viruses infecting the cat and goose are &gt;99% identical to that of A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/65/2005(H5N1). These findings support the notion that cats may be broadly susceptible to circulating H5N1 viruses and thus may play a role in reassortment, antigenic drift, and transmission."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

"Chairul Anwar Nidom of [[Airlangga University]] in Surabaya, [[Indonesia]], told journalists last week that he had taken blood samples from 500 stray cats near poultry markets in four areas of [[Java]], including the capital, [[Jakarta]], and one area in [[Sumatra]], all of which have recently had outbreaks of [[H5N1]] in [[poultry]] and people. Of these cats, 20% carried [[antibodies]] to H5N1. This does not mean that they were still carrying the virus, only that they had been infected - probably through eating birds that had H5N1. Many other cats that were infected are likely to have died from the resulting illness, so many more than 20% of the original cat populations may have acquired H5N1."&lt;ref name="Chairul Nidom"/&gt;

==Mammals in general==
[[Image:marten.jpg|thumb|right|[[Martens]] and an unknown number of other mammals can catch H5N1, illustrating the unprecedented ability of H5N1 to survive and spread.]]

[[H5N1]] has been transmitted in laboratories to many species including [[mouse|mice]] and [[ferret]]s to study its effects. A purposely mutated strain &lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; in ferrets&lt;ref name="cidrap.umn.edu"/&gt; has engendered a notable international policy debate regarding the openness of scientific research, the mandates of public health, and the potential for bioterrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Declan|title=UPDATED: Avian flu controversy comes to roost at WHO|url=http://www.nature.com/news/updated-avian-flu-controversy-comes-to-roost-at-who-1.10055|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/nature.2012.10055|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People living in areas where the A(H5N1) virus has infected birds are advised to keep their cats indoors. "Cats can be infected through the respiratory tract. Cats can also be infected when they ingest the virus, which is a novel route for influenza transmission in mammals. But cats excrete only one-thousandth the amount of virus that chickens do [...] The concern is that if large numbers of felines and other carnivores become infected, the virus might mutate in a series of events that could lead to an epidemic among humans. Dogs, foxes, seals, and other carnivores may be vulnerable to A(H5N1) virus infection, Dr. Osterhaus said. Tests in Thailand have shown that the virus has infected dogs without causing apparent symptoms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

H5N1 has the potential to infect [[cattle]]. Asymptomatic shedding of H5N1 by infected calves and subsequent seroconversion is possible. Bird-to-calf transmission resulting in seroconversion is probable. While the incidence of clinical infections of cattle with H5N1 in H5N1 endemic regions should be low, "serum from [[bovine]] species would be a valuable source of additional information about transmission events, especially in regions like Asia and Egypt, where HPAIV (H5N1) is endemic and probability of contact between poultry and cattle is high."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/14/7/1132.htm Emerg Infect Dis] article ''Experimental Infection of Cattle with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus (H5N1)'' published  July 2008 - Suggested Citation for this Article: "Kalthoff D, Hoffmann B, Harder T, Durban M, Beer M.

==Biography==

Writing about her childhood for ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2018, Macdonald said, &lt;blockquote&gt;"I grew up in [[Camberley]], a Victorian town on the A30 in Surrey. It was made of pine forests, golf courses, elderly army officers with parade ground voices, Conservative clubs and tea dances. In 1975 my parents had bought a little white house in [[Tekels Park]], a private estate near the town centre. It was owned by the [[Theosophical Society]]. My parents were journalists and knew nothing of theosophy, but they loved the Park, and I did too. No place has so indelibly shaped my writing life".&lt;ref name="Guardian 18 June 2018"&gt;{{cite news | title= Helen Macdonald on Camberley, Surrey: ‘No place has so indelibly shaped my writing life’|url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/18/helen-macdonald-made-in-camberley| last= Macdonald| first= Helen| date=18 June 2018 | work= [[The Guardian]] |publisher= [[Guardian Media Group]]| accessdate= 22 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Hyaloclastite''' is a volcaniclastic accumulation or breccia consisting of glass (from the Greek ''hyalus'') fragments (clasts) formed by quench fragmentation of lava flow surfaces during submarine extrusion. It occurs as thin margins on the lava flow surfaces and between pillow lavas as well as in thicker deposits, more commonly associated with explosive, volatile-rich eruptions as well as steeper topography. Hyaloclastites form during volcanic eruptions [[submarine eruption|under water]], [[subglacial eruption|under ice]] or where subaerial flows reach the sea or other bodies of water. It commonly has the appearance of angular flat fragments sized between a millimeter to few centimeters. The fragmentation occurs by the force of the volcanic explosion, or by thermal shock and spallation during rapid cooling.

Several minerals are found in hyaloclastite masses. [[Sideromelane]] is a [[basalt]] glass rapidly quenched in water. It is transparent and pure, lacking the [[iron oxide]] [[crystals]] dispersed in the more commonly occurring [[tachylite]]. Fragments of these glasses are usually surrounded by a yellow waxy layer of [[palagonite]], formed by reaction of sideromelane with water.

Hyaloclastite ridges, formed by [[subglacial eruption]]s during the [[last glacial period]], are a prominent landscape feature of [[Iceland]] and the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]]. Hyaloclastite is usually found at [[subglacial volcano]]es, such as [[tuya]]s, which is type of distinctive, flat-topped, steep-sided volcano formed when lava erupts through a thick glacier or ice sheet.

'''Hyalopilitic''' is a [[Texture (geology)|textural]] term used in [[petrographic]] classification of [[volcanic rock]]s.  Specifically, hyalopilitic refers to a volcanic rock [[Matrix (geology)|groundmass]], which is visible only under magnification with a [[petrographic microscope]], that contains a mixture of very fine-grained mineral crystals either mixed with natural [[volcanic glass]], or surrounded by thin bands of volcanic glass.

[[File:International Maritime Law Institute logo.jpg|thumb|200px|Logo of the International Maritime Law Institute]]
The IMO International Maritime Law Institute ('''IMLI''') was established in 1988 under the auspices of the [[International Maritime Organization]], a specialised agency of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo.org/OurWork/TechnicalCooperation/ITCP/Pages/Achievements.aspx |title=Achievements |publisher=IMO |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission is to training of specialists in maritime law The Institute is currently headquartered in [[Malta]], on the campus of the [[University of Malta]].

==History==
IMLI was established in 1988 under an Agreement concluded between [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]] and the [[Government of Malta]]. It commenced its first academic year in October 1989. Its campus is at the [[University of Malta]].

==Programmes==

===Overview===
The Institute offers academic course designed to cover the whole spectrum of international [[maritime law]], including [[international law]], [[law of the sea]], [[shipping law]], [[marine environmental law]], and legislation drafting. Training at the Institute concentrates on three areas:

# The development of expertise to advise on and develop national maritime legislation;
# The development of legislative drafting skills to ensure that States have the necessary expertise to incorporate international rules into domestic legislation; and
# The preparation of lawyers to participate in, and contribute to, the deliberations of the international maritime fora.

The duration of the course is one academic year and successful students are awarded a master's degree ([[LLM]]) in International Maritime Law.

More recently the Institute offers other Programmes of Study, ranging from the Doctor of Philosophy in International Maritime Law to an Advanced Diploma for non-lawyers who wish to understand the major features of international maritime law.

===Details===
IMLI offers three programmes – LL.M., Ph.D. and Advanced Diploma – and a wide number of short, modular courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edumaritime.com/europe/southern-europe/malta/imo-international-maritime-law-institute IMI Shipping &amp; Law Programmes]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MASTER OF LAWS (LL.M.) IN INTERNATIONAL MARITIME LAW'''

The [[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.) Programme in International Maritime Law is held over one academic year, beginning in September and running until May of the following year. It covers all areas of shipping law, the law of the sea, marine environmental law, maritime security law as well as legislative drafting. Participants are given special training in the techniques of implementation of international maritime conventions and regulations into domestic legislation. 
The Programme is delivered entirely in English. Since the setting up of the Institute 20 years ago, 464 lawyers from 112 States have graduated from the Institute’s LL.M. Programme. Graduates are instrumental in advising their Governments on the need for new or revised laws and regulations in maritime affairs and on their implementation. A high number of IMLI’s alumni occupy senior positions in Governments and shipping companies.

'''DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY (Ph.D.) IN INTERNATIONAL MARITIME LAW'''

The [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) programme is exclusively research-based and involves the writing and defence of a 100,000-word [[thesis]] in an area of international maritime law. A prestigious list of world-renowned experts in maritime law acts as supervisors. This is an external degree which must be completed within three to five years and may be undertaken almost entirely from abroad. A Master’s degree and university education in law are considered as pre-requisites.

'''ADVANCED DIPLOMA IN INTERNATIONAL MARITIME LAW'''

The Advanced Diploma Programme in International Maritime Law is designed to benefit professionals (including those in the most senior levels) who are involved in maritime practice both in the private and in the public sectors and who, because of their careers, are unable to be away from their jobs for any length of time in excess of a few weeks per year. The Programme is structured on a credit system. Candidates must earn a sufficient number of credits after following and successfully completing courses on distinct subject areas to allow him/her the award of an Advanced Diploma. The Programme is open to non-lawyers. Candidates are required to possess a degree from a recognized University or other academic institution, or must possess qualifications of comparable standards, including relevant professional or practical experience, or both, recognized for this purpose by the Institute.

'''SHORT COURSES'''

Modular, short-term courses are offered throughout the academic year on selected topics of maritime law. These courses are open to non-lawyers. On request, IMLI also provides tailor-made, intensive training courses and seminars to corporate and international organisations.

==Student Body==
In order to qualify, students – who primarily should come from developing States – are required to have a first law degree. At IMLI, 50% of the places on the course each year are reserved for women candidates. Candidates are generally nominated and supported by their Governments, but seats are also allocated to independent candidates.

==Officials==
Chairman of the Governing Board: [[Efthimios Mitropoulos]] 
Director: [[Professor David Attard]] (1992–present)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11592">{{short description|State of gravitational equilibrium between Earth's crust and mantle}}
'''Isostasy''' (Greek [[wikt:ἴσος|''ísos'']] "equal", [[wikt:στάσις|''stásis'']] "standstill") is the state of [[gravity|gravitational]] equilibrium between [[Earth]]'s [[crust (geology)|crust]] and [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] such that the [[crust (geology)|crust]] "floats" at an elevation that depends on its thickness and density.

This concept is invoked to explain how different topographic heights can exist at Earth's surface. When a certain area of Earth's crust reaches the state of isostasy, it is said to be in ''isostatic equilibrium''. Isostasy does not upset equilibrium but instead restores it (a negative feedback). It is generally accepted &lt;ref&gt;A.B. Watts, Isostasy and flexure of the lithosphere,Cambridge Univ. Press., 2001&lt;/ref&gt; that Earth is a dynamic system that responds to loads in many different ways. However, isostasy provides an important 'view' of the processes that are happening in areas that are experiencing vertical movement. Certain areas (such as the [[Himalayas]]) are not in isostatic equilibrium, which has forced researchers to identify other reasons to explain their topographic heights (in the case of the Himalayas, which are still rising, by proposing that their elevation is being supported by the force of the impacting [[Indian Plate]]; the [[Basin and Range Province]] of the Western US is another example of a region not in isostatic equilibrium.)

Although originally defined in terms of [[continental crust]] and mantle, it has subsequently been interpreted in terms of [[lithosphere]] and [[asthenosphere]], particularly with respect to oceanic island [[volcano]]es such as the [[Hawaiian Islands]].

In the simplest example, isostasy is the principle of [[buoyancy]] wherein an object immersed in a [[fluid]] is buoyed with a force equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. On a geological scale, isostasy can be observed where Earth's strong crust or lithosphere exerts stress on the weaker mantle or asthenosphere, which, over [[geologic timescale|geological time]], flows laterally such that the load is accommodated by height adjustments.

The general term 'isostasy' was coined in the year 1889 by the American geologist [[Clarence Dutton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://books.nap.edu/html/biomems/cdutton.pdf | title=Clarence Edward Dutton | date=1958 | accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Isostatic models ==
Three principal models of isostasy are used:
# The [[George Airy|Airy]]–[[Veikko Aleksanteri Heiskanen|Heiskanen]] model – where different topographic heights are accommodated by changes in [[Crust (geology)|crustal]] thickness, in which the crust has a constant density
# The [[John Henry Pratt|Pratt]]–[[John Fillmore Hayford|Hayford]] model – where different topographic heights are accommodated by lateral changes in [[Rock (geology)|rock]] [[density]].
# The [[Vening Meinesz]], or [[flexural isostasy]] model – where the [[lithosphere]] acts as an [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] plate and its inherent rigidity distributes local topographic loads over a broad region by bending.

Airy and Pratt isostasy are statements of buoyancy, whereas flexural isostasy is a statement of buoyancy when deflecting a sheet of finite elastic strength.

=== Airy ===
[[File:Airy Isostasy.jpg|thumb|right|Airy isostasy, in which a constant-density crust floats on a higher-density mantle, and topography is determined by the thickness of the crust.]]
[[File:Backstripping and eustasy correction.jpg|thumb|Airy isostasy applied to a real-case basin scenario, where the total load on the mantle is composed by a crustal basement, lower-density sediments and overlying marine water]]

The basis of the model is [[Pascal's law]], and particularly its consequence that, within a fluid in static equilibrium, the hydrostatic pressure is the same on every point at the same elevation (surface of hydrostatic compensation). In other words:

h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;⋅ρ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;⋅ρ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = h&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;⋅ρ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ... h&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;⋅ρ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;

For the simplified picture shown the depth of the mountain belt roots (b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) are:

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt; (h_1+c+b_1)\rho_c = (c\rho_c)+(b_1\rho_m) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt; {b_1(\rho_m-\rho_c)} = h_1\rho_c &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt; b_1 = \frac{h_1\rho_c}{\rho_m-\rho_c} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \rho_m &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the mantle (ca. 3,300&amp;nbsp;kg m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) and &lt;math&gt; \rho_c &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the crust (ca. 2,750&amp;nbsp;kg m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus, we may generally consider:

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≅ 5⋅h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

In the case of negative topography (i.e., a marine basin), the balancing of lithospheric columns gives:

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt; c\rho_c = (h_2\rho_w)+(b_2\rho_m)+[(c-h_2-b_2)\rho_c] &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt; {b_2(\rho_m-\rho_c)} = {h_2(\rho_c-\rho_w)} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt; b_2 = (\frac{\rho_c-\rho_w}{\rho_m-\rho_c}){h_2} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \rho_m &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the mantle (ca. 3,300&amp;nbsp;kg m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;), &lt;math&gt; \rho_c &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the crust (ca. 2,750&amp;nbsp;kg m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) and &lt;math&gt; \rho_w &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the water (ca. 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus, we may generally consider:

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≅ 3.2⋅h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

=== Pratt ===

For the simplified model shown the new density is given by: &lt;math&gt; \rho_1 = \rho_c \frac{c}{h_1+c} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;h_1&lt;/math&gt; is the height of the mountain and c the thickness of the crust.

=== Vening Meinesz / flexural ===

[[File:Local-regional isostasy - flexure, elastic thickness.jpg|thumb|Cartoon showing the isostatic vertical motions of the lithosphere (grey) in response to a vertical load (in green)]]
This hypothesis was suggested to explain how large topographic loads such as [[seamounts]] (e.g. [[Hawaiian Islands]]) could be compensated by regional rather than local displacement of the lithosphere. This is the more general solution for [[lithospheric flexure]], as it approaches the locally compensated models above as the load becomes much larger than a flexural wavelength or the flexural rigidity of the lithosphere approaches zero.

==Isostatic effects of deposition and erosion==

When large amounts of sediment are deposited on a particular region, the immense weight of the new sediment may cause the crust below to sink. Similarly, when large amounts of material are eroded away from a region, the land may rise to compensate. Therefore, as a mountain range is eroded, the (reduced) range rebounds upwards (to a certain extent) to be eroded further. Some of the rock strata now visible at the ground surface may have spent much of their history at great depths below the surface buried under other strata, to be eventually exposed as those other strata eroded away and the lower layers rebounded upwards.

An analogy may be made with an [[iceberg]]—it always floats with a certain proportion of its mass below the surface of the water. If more ice is added to the top of the iceberg, the iceberg will sink lower in the water. If a layer of ice is somehow sliced off the top of the iceberg, the remaining iceberg will rise. Similarly, Earth's lithosphere "floats" in the asthenosphere.

==Isostatic effects of plate tectonics==

When continents collide, the continental crust may thicken at their edges in the collision. If this happens, much of the thickened crust may move ''downwards'' rather than up as with the iceberg analogy. The idea of continental collisions building mountains "up" is therefore rather a simplification. Instead, the crust ''thickens'' and ''the upper part of the thickened crust'' may become a mountain range.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

However, some continental collisions are far more complex than this, and the region may not be in isostatic equilibrium, so this subject has to be treated with caution for better understanding .{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Isostatic effects of ice sheets==
{{Main|Post-glacial rebound}}
The formation of [[ice sheets]] can cause Earth's surface to sink. Conversely, isostatic post-glacial rebound is observed in areas once covered by ice sheets that have now melted, such as around the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Hudson Bay]].  As the ice retreats, the load on the [[lithosphere]] and [[asthenosphere]] is reduced and they ''rebound'' back towards their equilibrium levels.  In this way, it is possible to find former [[sea cliff]]s and associated [[wave-cut platform]]s hundreds of metres above present-day [[sea level]]. The rebound movements are so slow that the uplift caused by the ending of the last [[glacial period]] is still continuing.

In addition to the vertical movement of the land and sea, isostatic adjustment of the Earth also involves horizontal movements. It can cause changes in Earth's [[Earth's gravity|gravitational field]] and [[Rotation of Earth|rotation rate]], [[polar wander]], and [[earthquake]]s.

== Eustasy and relative sea level change ==
{{Main|Eustasy}}
Eustasy is another cause of relative [[sea level change]] quite different from isostatic causes.  The term ''eustasy'' or ''eustatic'' refers to changes in the volume of water in the oceans, usually due to [[global climate change]]. When Earth's climate cools, a greater proportion of water is stored on land masses in the form of glaciers, snow, etc. This results in falling global sea levels (relative to a stable land mass). The refilling of ocean basins by [[glacial meltwater]] at the end of ice ages is an example of eustatic [[sea level rise]].

A second significant cause of eustatic sea level rise is thermal expansion of sea water when Earth's mean temperature increases. Current estimates of global eustatic rise from tide gauge records and [[satellite altimetry]] is about +3&amp;nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]]/[[annum|a]] (see 2007 IPCC report).  Global sea level is also affected by vertical crustal movements, changes in Earth's rotation rate, large-scale changes in [[continental margin]]s and changes in the spreading rate of the [[ocean floor]].

When the term ''relative'' is used in context with ''sea level change'', the implication is that both eustasy and isostasy are at work, or that the author does not know which cause to invoke.

Post-glacial rebound can also be a cause of rising sea levels. When the sea floor rises, which it continues to do in parts of the northern hemisphere, water is displaced and has to go elsewhere.

==Newt Gingrich book==
Hayhoe wrote a chapter of a book by [[Newt Gingrich]] about climate change in 2009, and, in 2011, was told by Gingrich's co-author, Terry Maple, that it had been accepted.&lt;ref name=Grist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grist.org/climate-change/chatting-with-newts-dissed-evangelical-climate-expert|title=Chatting with the climate scientist Newt dissed|work=[[Grist (magazine)|Grist]]|date=January 17, 2012|accessdate=January 31, 2014|author=Roberts, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gingrich announced in late 2011 that this chapter was dropped on his request, saying "We didn't know that they were doing that, and we told them to kill it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2012/01/newt-dumps-leading-climate-scientist|title=Newt Dumps Christian Climate Scientist|work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|date=January 6, 2012|accessdate=September 8, 2013|author=Sheppard, Kate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon finding out that her chapter had been dropped, Hayhoe stated, "I had not heard that" and tweeted that she had spent over 100 unpaid hours working on the chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57350372-503544/gingrich-kills-chapter-on-climate-change-in-upcoming-book|title=Gingrich kills chapter on climate change in upcoming book|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=December 30, 2011|accessdate=September 8, 2013|author=Huisenga, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have speculated that Gingrich dropped her chapter because [[Marc Morano]], who is not a scientist, wrote many articles on his website, ''Climate Depot'', attacking her findings.&lt;ref name=Grist/&gt; This, as well as her appearing on [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]]'s TV show, led to her receiving nearly 200 hate-mail messages the following day.&lt;ref name=TheGlobeandMail/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://texasclimatenews.org/wp/?p=4153 | title=Texas Tech Scientist Sees Intimidation Effort Behind Barrage of Hate Mail | work=Texas Climate News | publisher=Huston Advanced Research Center | date=January 30, 2012 | accessdate=September 8, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830122148/http://texasclimatenews.org/wp/?p=4153 | archivedate=August 30, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, the conservative PAC [[American Tradition Partnership|American Tradition Institute]] filed a request under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] for Hayhoe's public university employer to  release her notes and emails related to the writing of the unpublished chapter for the Gingrich book.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Clynes, [http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-06/battle-over-climate-change "The Battle Over Climate Science"], ''Popular Science'', June 21. 2012, Retrieved September 11, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Orthographic projection centred over Kerguelen Island.png|thumb|Location of the plateau – the white spot is Kerguelen Island]]

The '''Kerguelen Plateau''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˈ|k|ɜr|ɡ|əl|ən}}, {{IPAc-en|k|ər|ˈ|ɡ|eɪ|l|ən}})&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[oceanic plateau]] and a [[large igneous province]] (LIP) located on the [[Antarctic Plate]], in the southern [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|UT Austin 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a [[microcontinent]] and [[submerged continent]]. It is about {{cvt|3000|km}} to the southwest of [[Australia]] and is nearly three times the size of [[Japan]]. The [[plateau]] extends for more than {{cvt|2200|km}} in a northwest–southeast direction and lies in deep water.

The plateau was produced by the [[Kerguelen hotspot]], starting with or following the breakup of [[Gondwana]] about 130&amp;nbsp;million years ago. A small portion of the plateau breaks [[sea level]], forming the [[Kerguelen Islands]] (a [[France|French]] territory) plus the [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands|Heard and McDonald Islands]] (an Australian territory). Intermittent [[volcanism]] continues on the Heard and McDonald Islands.

==Geographical extent==
Symmetrically across the Indian Ocean ridge and due west of Australia is the [[Broken Ridge Plateau|Broken Ridge]] underwater [[volcanic plateau]], which at one time was contiguous with the Kerguelen Plateau before rifting by the [[mid-ocean ridge]].

To the north of Broken Ridge is the linear [[Ninety East Ridge]] which continues almost due north into the [[Bay of Bengal]] and is considered to be a [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] track.

One of the largest [[Large igneous province|igneous provinces]] (LIPs) in the world, the Kerguelen Plateau covers an area of {{cvt|1250000|km2}} and rises {{cvt|2000|m}} above the surrounding oceanic basins.&lt;ref name="Bénard-etal-2010-intro"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bénard|Callot|Vially|Schmitz|2010|loc=Introduction, pp. 1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located on the [[Antarctic Plate]], the Kerguelen Plateau is separated from Australia by the [[Southeast Indian Ridge]] (SEIR) and from Africa by the [[Southwest Indian Ridge]] (SWIR). These two ridges meet at the [[Rodrigues Triple Point|Rodriguez Triple Junction]]. It is separated from Antarctica by [[Princess Elizabeth Trough]] and the [[Cooperation Sea]]. The eastern margin north of the William Ridge is steep and formed during the breakup between the Kerguelen Plateau and the Broken Ridge. The southern part of the margin is separated from the Australian–Antarctic Basin by the deep [[Labuan Basin]].&lt;ref name="Bénard-etal-2010-setting"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bénard|Callot|Vially|Schmitz|2010|loc=Geological and plate boundary setting, p. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geological history==
From the initial opening of the Indian Ocean until present, the Kerguelen hotspot has produced several now widely dispersed large-scale structures. The Southern Kerguelen Plateau (SKP) formed 119–110&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}}; the Elan Bank 108–107&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}}, named by Dennis E. Hayes of Lamont Doherty Easth Observatory}; the Central Kerguelen Plateau (CKP) 101–100&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}}; the [[Broken Ridge]] (connected to CKP before the Eocene breakup) formed 95–94&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}}; the Skiff Bank (east of Kerguelen archipelago) 69–68&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}}; Northern Kerguelen Plateau (NKP) 35–34&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}}; [[Ninety East Ridge]] formed 82–38&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}} north to south; the [[Bunbury Basalt]] (western Australia) formed at 137-130.5 {{abbr|Ma|million years ago}} &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-04-15|title=Bunbury Basalt: Gondwana breakup products or earliest vestiges of the Kerguelen mantle plume?|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X1630019X|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|language=en|volume=440|pages=20–32|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2016.02.008|issn=0012-821X}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the [[Naturaliste Plateau]] (offshore western Australia) formed 132-128 Ma &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Direen|first=N.|date=2017|title=Naturaliste Plateau: constraints on the timing and evolution of the Kerguelen Large Igneous Province and its role in Gondwana breakup|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08120099.2017.1367326|journal=Australian Journal of Earth Sciences|volume=64|pages=851–869|doi=10.1080/08120099.2017.1367326|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the [[Rajmahal Traps]] in northeast India 118–117&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}}; and finally [[lamprophyre]]s in India and Antarctica 115–114&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frey|Coffin|Wallace|Weis|2003|loc=Geochronology, p. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India–Australia breakup===
The oldest volcanism that can be attributed to the Kerguelen plume are the Bunbury Basalt (137-130.5 {{abbr|Ma|million years ago}} &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) and Naturaliste Plateau (132-128 Ma &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) in southwestern Australia, and the [[Rajmahal Traps]] in eastern India (118&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}}). The formation of the oldest portion of the Kerguelen LIP and these continental basalts are linked to the opening of the eastern Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ingle|Scoates|Weis|Brügmann|2004|loc=Introduction, p. 84}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Bunbury Basalt is not of flood basalt dimension which suggest that the mantle underlying the newly formed Kerguelen hotspot was neither significantly hot, wet, or voluminous. In contrast, the magmatism that produced the Australia–India breakup 136–158&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}} created the [[Wallaby Plateau]], but no known hotspot has been linked to this event.&lt;ref name="Frey-etal-2003-p5-6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frey|Coffin|Wallace|Weis|2003|loc=The Kerguelen Hotspot and Indian Ocean Plate Reconstructions, pp. 5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India–Antarctica breakup===
The output from the Kerguelen hotspot peaked 120–95&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}}, 12–70&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}} after the India–Antarctica breakup. No ridges or hotspot tracks such as [[Walvis Ridge|Walvis]]–[[Rio Grande Rise|Rio Grande]], [[Chagos-Laccadive Ridge|Chagos–Laccadive]], [[Greenland-Scotland Ridge|Greenland–Scotland]] have been found in the [[Princess Elizabeth Trough]] between SKP and Antarctica or along India's conjugate eastern continental margin. The relation between the Kerguelen hotspot and these continental breakup and volcanic margins is instead similar to that between the [[Réunion hotspot]] and the [[Deccan Traps]] and the breakup between western India and the [[Seychelles]].&lt;ref name="Frey-etal-2003-p5-6" /&gt;

The peak output of the Kerguelen hotspot coincides with one or several microcontinent formations, such as the Elan Bank.&lt;ref name="Frey-etal-2003-p5-6" /&gt; Since the Indian Ocean began to open about 130&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}}, the Kerguelen hotspot has moved 3–10° southward and, consequently, the spreading ridge between India and Antarctica has jumped northward one or several times. Parts of the Kerguelen Plateau, the Elan Bank and the SKP, were originally attached to India and are composed of continental lithosphere. One or several ridge jumps transformed the Elan Bank into a microcontinent and dispersed continental fragments in the SKP, and these structures were eventually left behind as India moved northward.&lt;ref name="Frey-etal-2003-p5-6" /&gt; The ridge jump that made the Elan Bank a microcontinent occurred after 124&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}}.&lt;ref name="Bénard-etal-2010-intro" /&gt;
The development of the Southern Kerguelen Plateau (SKP) 118–119&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}} contributed to the [[Aptian extinction|oceanic anoxic event 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wallace|Frey|Weis|Coffin|2002|loc=1105–1106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 83.5&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}} sea floor spreading between India and Antarctica was asymmetric in the Kerguelen Plateau region with two-thirds of the sea floor created being added to the Antarctic Plate. A ridge jump eventually transferred parts of the Kerguelen Plateau from the Indian Plate to the Antarctic Plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller|Gaina|Clark|2000|loc=C34 Late Cretaceous (Santonian) 83.5&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}}, p. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cenozoic volcanism===
The Kerguelen hotspot produced the {{cvt|5000|km}} long Ninety East Ridge 82–38&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}}, and geochemical evidence suggests that this occurred at or near a spreading ridge. The lack of a conjugate structure on the Antarctic Plate, however, makes it unlikely that the hotspot was located at a spreading ridge during this long period. As the Antarctic Plate then moved over the Kerguelen hotspot the NKP formed over relatively old oceanic crust. Flood basalts in the Kerguelen archipelago formed 30–24&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}} and less voluminous and more recent volcanism occurred until 1&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}}. During the last 21&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}} volcanic structures have formed on the CKP, including Heard Island, and both Heard and McDonald Islands have had recent eruptions.&lt;ref name="Frey-etal-2003-p5-6" /&gt;

65&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}}, the CKP–Broken Ridge LIP was located near the Kerguelen plume and the plate boundaries of the Indian Ocean. The LIP was the product of 25&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}} of relatively high magmatic activity followed by a 40&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|Ma|million years ago}} period of lower activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Whittaker|Williams|Müller|2013|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Microcontinent==
{{Harvnb|Schlich|Delteil|Moulin|Patriat|1971}} described tilted basement blocks near the Kerguelen archipelago and was the first to identify the Kerguelen Plateau as of continental origin, in contrast to other LIPs.&lt;ref name="Bénard-etal-2010-intro" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schlich|Delteil|Moulin|Patriat|1971|loc=p. 2062}}: Toutes ces caractéristiques, épaisse série sédimentaire plus ou moins structurée avec l'ensemble inférieur lié à une tectonique de socle, importance des accidents tectonique limitant le bassin sédimentaire, sont en faveur d'une origine contintentale du plateau de Kerguelen-Heard.&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of soil layers in the basalt which included [[charcoal]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] fragments of [[gneiss]] indicate that much of the plateau was above sea level as what is termed a [[microcontinent]] for three periods between 100&amp;nbsp;million years ago and 20&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The charcoal was made by [[wildfire]]s started by lightning or lava flows.) 
Large parts of the now submarine Southern (SKP) and Central Kerguelen Plateaus (CKP) were [[subaerial]] during the formation of the LIP. The SKP probably formed an island of {{cvt|500000|km2}} with major peaks reaching {{cvt|1000|-|2000|m}} above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frey|Coffin|Wallace|Weis|2003|loc=Subsidence of the Kerguelen Plateau, pp. 16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kerguelen microcontinent may have been covered by dense conifer forest in the mid-[[Cretaceous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mohr|Wähnert|Lazarus|2002|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It finally sank 20&amp;nbsp;million years ago and is now {{cvt|1000|-|2000|m}} below sea level.

==Biodiversity==
During the austral summer there is a high density of migratory whales including [[sperm whale|sperm]], [[minke whale|minke]], and [[humpback whale|humpback]] whales along the southern end of the Kerguelen Plateau and the northern part of the adjacent Princess Elizabeth Trough. These whales choose this location for foraging because the Southern Front of the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] is steered off by the plateau&amp;nbsp;— resulting in a poleward extent for the Southern Front only found near the Kerguelen Plateau. This brings shoaled, nutrient-rich Upper Circumpolar Deep Water to the surface which brings macronutrients to the surface. Ice is additionally advected north along the eastern side of the plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tynan|1997|loc=Introduction, p. 2793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Linguistics}}
'''Language development''' is a process starting early in human life. Infants start without knowing a language, yet by 10 months, babies can distinguish speech sounds and engage in [[babbling]]. Some research has shown that the earliest learning begins in utero when the [[fetus]] starts to recognize the sounds and speech patterns of its [[mother's voice]] and differentiate them from other sounds after birth.&lt;ref name="Graven, 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graven|first=Stanley N.|last2=MD|last3=Browne|first3=Joy V.|date=December 2008|title=Auditory development in the fetus and infant|url=|journal=Newborn and Infant Nursing Reviews|volume=8|issue=4|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, children develop receptive language abilities before their verbal or expressive language develops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guess|first=D|date=1969|title=A functional analysis of receptive language and productive speech: acquisition of the plural morpheme|url=|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=2 |issue=1|pages=55–64|via=|pmid=16795203|pmc=1311037}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Receptive language]] is the internal processing and understanding of language. As receptive language continues to increase, [[expressive language]] begins to slowly develop.

Usually, productive language is considered to begin with a stage of pre-verbal communication in which infants use gestures and vocalizations to make their intents known to others. According to a general principle of development, new forms then take over old functions, so that children learn words to express the same communicative functions they had already expressed by proverbial means.&lt;ref name="Kennison, 2013"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kennison, S. M. |title=Introduction to language development |publisher=Sage |location= Los Angeles, CA |year=2013 |isbn=9781412996068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical frameworks==
{{main|Language acquisition}}

Language development is thought to proceed by ordinary processes of learning in which children acquire the forms, meanings, and uses of words and utterances from the linguistic input.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Children often begin reproducing the words that they are repetitively exposed to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cameron-Faulkner|first=Thea|last2=Lieven|first2=Elena|last3=Tomasello|first3=Michael|date=2003-11-01|title=A construction based analysis of child directed speech|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1207/s15516709cog2706_2|journal=Cognitive Science|language=en|volume=27|issue=6|pages=843–873|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2706_2|issn=1551-6709}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The method in which we develop language skills is universal; however, the major debate is how the rules of [[syntax]] are acquired.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} There are two major approaches to syntactic development, an empiricist account by which children learn all syntactic rules from the linguistic input, and a [[Innatism|nativist]] approach by which some principles of syntax are innate and are transmitted through the human genome.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The '''[[Psychological nativism|nativist theory]]''', proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]], argues that language is a unique human accomplishment, and can be attributed to either "millions of years of evolution" or to "principles of neural organization that may be even more deeply grounded in physical law".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aspects of the Theory of Syntax|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|publisher=MIT Press|year=1965|isbn=|location=|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky says that all children have what is called an innate [[language acquisition device]] (LAD). Theoretically, the LAD is an area of the brain that has a set of universal syntactic rules for all languages. This device provides children with the ability to make sense of knowledge and construct novel sentences with minimal external input and little experience. Chomsky's claim is based upon the view that what children hear—their linguistic input—is insufficient to explain how they come to learn language.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  He argues that linguistic input from the environment is limited and full of errors. Therefore, nativists assume that it is impossible for children to learn linguistic information solely from their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davies|first1=Alan|title=Nativism|journal=The Encyclopedia of Applied Linguistics|date=November 2012|doi=10.1002/9781405198431.wbeal0856|isbn=9781405194730}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because children possess this LAD, they are in fact, able to learn language despite incomplete information from their environment. Their capacity to learn language is also attributed to the theory of universal grammar (UG), which posits that a certain set of structural rules are innate to humans, independent of sensory experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last1=Flevaris|first1=Taki|title=Nativism in Linguistics: Empirical and Theoretical Issues|date=2015|accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has dominated linguistic theory for over fifty years and remains highly influential, as witnessed by the number of articles in journals and books.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The ''' [[empiricist|empiricist theory]]''' suggests, contra Chomsky, that there is enough information in the linguistic input children receive and therefore, there is no need to assume an innate language acquisition device exists (see above). Rather than a LAD evolved specifically for language, empiricists believe that general brain processes are sufficient enough for language acquisition. During this process, it is necessary for the child to actively engage with their environment. For a child to learn language, the parent or caregiver adopts a particular way of appropriately communicating with the child; this is known as child-directed speech (CDS).{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} CDS is used so that children are given the necessary linguistic information needed for their language. Empiricism is a general approach and sometimes goes along with the interactionist approach. '''[[Statistical language acquisition]]''', which falls under empiricist theory, suggests that infants acquire language by means of pattern perception.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Other researchers embrace an '''[[interactionist|interactionist perspective]]''', consisting of '''social-interactionist theories''' of language development. In such approaches, children learn language in the interactive and communicative context, learning language forms for meaningful moves of communication. These theories focus mainly on the caregiver's attitudes and attentiveness to their children in order to promote productive language habits.&lt;ref name="Poll 2011"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Poll| first1=G. H.|title=Increasing the Odds: Applying Emergentist Theory in Language Intervention|journal=Language, Speech, and Hearing Services in Schools| volume=42| issue=4| year=2011| pages=580–591|doi=10.1044/0161-1461(2011/10-0041)| pmid=21616988|pmc=3164388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An older empiricist theory, the '''[[behaviorist theory]]''' proposed by [[B. F. Skinner]]  suggested that language is learned through operant conditioning, namely, by imitation of stimuli and by reinforcement of correct responses. This perspective has not been widely accepted at any time, but by some accounts, is experiencing a resurgence. New studies use this theory now to treat individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders. Additionally, Relational Frame Theory is growing from the behaviorist theory, which is important for Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.&lt;ref name="Roediger"&gt;Roediger, R. (2004) "[http://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/getArticle.cfm?id=1540 What happened to Behaviorism]." American Psychological Society.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[empiricist|empiricist theory]] accounts today use behaviorist models.&lt;ref name="Ramscar, 2007a"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramscar M, Yarlett D |title=Linguistic self-correction in the absence of feedback: a new approach to the logical problem of language acquisition |journal=Cogn Sci |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=927–60 |date=November 2007 |pmid=21635323 |doi=10.1080/03640210701703576 |url=http://psych.stanford.edu/~michael/papers/ramscar-and-yarlett-lwof.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other relevant theories about language development include [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]], which considers the development of language as a continuation of general cognitive development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clibbens|first=John|title=From theory to practice in child language development|journal=Down Syndrome Research and Practice|date=October 1993|volume=1|issue=3|pages=101–106|url=http://www.down-syndrome.org/reviews/20/reviews-20.pdf|accessdate=2012-11-20|doi=10.3104/reviews.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vygotsky's social theories that attribute the development of language to an individual's social interactions and growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schneider|first=Phyllis|author2=Watkins, Ruth |title=Applying Vygotskian Developmental Theory to Language Intervention|journal=Language, Speech &amp; Hearing Services in Schools|date=April 1996|volume=27|issue=2|pages=157–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological preconditions==
[[Evolutionary biologists]] are skeptical of the claim that syntactic knowledge is transmitted in the human genome. However, many researchers claim that the ability to acquire such a complicated system is unique to the human species. Non-biologists also tend to believe that our ability to learn spoken language may have been developed through the [[evolution]]ary process and that the foundation for language may be passed down genetically. The ability to speak and understand human language requires [[speech production]] skills and abilities as well as [[multisensory integration]] of [[sensory processing]] abilities.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

One hotly debated issue is whether the biological contribution includes capacities specific to language acquisition, often referred to as universal grammar. For fifty years, linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] has argued for the hypothesis that children have innate, language-specific abilities that facilitate and constrain language learning.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  In particular, he has proposed that humans are biologically prewired to learn language at a certain time and in a certain way, arguing that children are born with a language acquisition device (LAD).&lt;ref name="Santrock, 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Santrock, John W. |title=A Topical Approach to Lifespan Development |publisher=McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages |location= |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=978-0-07-338264-7 |oclc=171151508 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since he developed the [[minimalist program]], his latest version of theory of syntactic structure, Chomsky has reduced the elements of universal grammar, which he believes are prewired in humans to just the principle of recursion, thus voiding most of the nativist endeavor.&lt;ref name="Hauser, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hauser MD, Chomsky N, Fitch WT |title=The faculty of language: what is it, who has it, and how did it evolve? |journal=Science |volume=298 |issue=5598 |pages=1569–79 |date=November 2002 |pmid=12446899 |doi=10.1126/science.298.5598.1569 |url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228122250/http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers who believe that grammar is learned rather than innate, have hypothesized that language learning results from general cognitive abilities and the interaction between learners and their human interactants.  It has also recently been suggested that the relatively slow development of the [[prefrontal cortex]] in humans may be one reason that humans are able to learn language, whereas other species are not.&lt;ref name="Thompson-Schill 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thompson-Schill SL, Ramscar M, Chrysikou EG |title=Cognition without control: When a little frontal lobe goes a long way |journal=Curr Dir Psychol Sci |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=259–263 |year=2009 |pmid=20401341 |pmc=2855545 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01648.x |url=http://psych.stanford.edu/~michael/papers/Ramscar_control.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramscar, 2007b"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramscar M, Gitcho N |title=Developmental change and the nature of learning in childhood |journal=Trends Cogn.

{{see also|Gestures in language acquisition}}
Language development and processing begins before birth. Evidence has shown that there is language development occurring antepartum. DeCasper and Spence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=DeCasper A. |author2=Lecanuet J. |author3=Bunsel M. |author4=Granier-Deferre C. |author5=Maugeais R. | year = 1994 | title = Fetal Reactions to Recurrent Maternal Speech | url = http://www.psych.yorku.ca/adler/courses/4010/Articles/DeCasper%20et%20al%201994.pdf | journal = Infant Behavior and Development | volume = 17 |issue=2 | pages = 159–164 | doi=10.1016/0163-6383(94)90051-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed a study in 1986 by having mothers read aloud during the last few weeks of pregnancy. When the infants were born, they were then tested. They were read aloud a story while sucking on a pacifier; the story was either the story read by the mother when the infant was in utero or a new story. The pacifier used was able to determine the rate of sucking that the infant was performing. When the story that the mother had read before was heard, the sucking of the pacifier was modified. This did not occur during the story that the infant had not heard before. The results for this experiment had shown that the infants were able to recognize what they had heard in utero, providing insight that language development had been occurring in the last six weeks of pregnancy.

Throughout the first year of life, infants are unable to communicate with language. Instead, infants communicate with [[gesture]]s. This phenomenon is known as prelinguistic gestures, which are nonverbal ways that infants communicate that also had a plan backed with the gesture. Examples of these could be pointing at an object, tugging on the shirt of a parent to get the parent's attention, etc. Harding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Harding C. |  year = 1983 | title = An Investigation Of Developmental Mechanisms In The Development Of Intentional Communication | url = http://storage.rockarch.org/0db54f4c-8a3d-4394-b3f3-0bf52b46804a-FCD001_103_00113.pdf | journal = Foundation for Child Development | pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1983, devised the major criteria that come along with the behavior of prelinguistic gestures and their intent to communicate. There are three major criteria that go along with a prelinguistic gesture: waiting, persistence, and ultimately, development of alternative plans. This process usually occurs around 8 months of age, where an appropriate scenario may be of a child tugging on the shirt of a parent to wait for the attention of the parent who would then notice the infant, which causes the infant to point to something they desire. This would describe the first two criteria. The development of alternative plans may arise if the parent does not acknowledge what the infant wants, the infant may entertain itself to satisfy the previous desire.

When children reach about 15–18 months of age, language acquisition flourishes. There is a surge in word production resulting from the growth of the cortex. Infants begin to learn the words that form a sentence and within the sentence, the word endings can be interpreted. Elissa Newport and colleagues (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Saffran J. |author2=Aslin R. |author3=Newport E. | year = 1994 | title = Statistical learning by 8-month-old infants | url = http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/newport/saffran1996.pdf | doi = 10.1126/science.274.5294.1926 | journal = Science | volume = 274 | issue = 5294 | pages = 1926–1928 | pmid=8943209}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that humans learn first about the sounds of a language, and then move on to how to speak the language. This shows how infants learn the end of a word and know that a new word is being spoken. From this step, infants are then able to determine the structure of a language and word.

It appears that during the early years of language development females exhibit an advantage over males of the same age. When infants between the age of 16 to 22 months were observed interacting with their mothers, a female advantage was obvious. The females in this age range showed more spontaneous speech production than the males and this finding was not due to mothers speaking more with daughters than sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Huttenlocher J. |author2=Haight W. |author3=Bryk A. |author4=Seltzer M. |author5=Lyons T. | year = 1991 | title = Early vocabulary growth: Relation to language input and gender | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1991-20903-001 | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 236–248 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.27.2.236}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, boys between 2 and 6 years as a group did not show higher performance in language development over their girl counterparts on experimental assessments.  In studies using adult populations, 18 and over, it seems that the female advantage may be task dependent. Depending on the task provided, a female advantage may or may not be present.&lt;ref name="Bornstein2004"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Bornstein| first1=M. H.|title=Specific and general language performance across early childhood: Stability and gender considerations|journal=First Language|volume=24| issue=3| year=2004| pages=267–304| doi=10.1177/0142723704045681}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, one study found that out of the 5.5% of American children with language impairments, 7.2% are male, and 3.8% are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Danger|first=S|date=2005|title=Child-Centered Group Play Therapy with Children with Speech Difficulties.|url=|journal=International Journal of Play Therapy|volume=14 |issue=1|pages=1–97|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different suggested explanations for this gender gap in language impairment prevalence.

===Lateralization effect on language===
It is currently believed that in regards to [[Lateralization of brain function|brain lateralization]] males are left-lateralized, while females are bilateralized. Studies on patients with unilateral [[lesion]]s have provided evidence that females are in fact more bilateralized with their verbal abilities. It seems that when a female has experienced a [[lesion]] to the [[Lateralization of brain function|left hemisphere]], she is better able to compensate for this damage than a male can. If a male has a lesion in the left hemisphere, his verbal abilities are greatly impaired in comparison to a control male of the same age without that damage.&lt;ref name="Frith Vargha-Khadem 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frith|first1=Uta|last2=Vargha-Khadem| first2=Faraneh|title=Are there sex differences in the brain basis of literacy related skills?

=== Fine motor development rate ===
Shriberg, Tomblin, and McSweeny (1999) suggest that the fine motor skills necessary for correct speech may develop more slowly in males.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shriberg|first=Lawrence D.|last2=Tomblin|first2=J. Bruce|last3=McSweeny|first3=Jane L.|date=1999-12-01|title=Prevalence of Speech Delay in 6-Year-Old Children and Comorbidity With Language Impairment|url=https://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1781216|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|language=en|volume=42|issue=6|pages=1461–1481|doi=10.1044/jslhr.4206.1461|issn=1092-4388}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could explain why some of the language impairments in young males seems to spontaneously improve over time.

=== Over diagnosis ===
It is also suggested that the gender gap in language impairment prevalence could also be explained by the clinical over diagnosis of males. Males tend to be clinically over diagnosed with a variety of disorders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Visibility ===
The study by Shriber et al. (1999) further explains that this gap in the prevalence of language impairment could be because males tend to be more visible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These researchers reveal that male children tend to act out behaviorally when they have any sort of disorder, while female children tend to turn inward and develop emotional disorders as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, the high ratio of males with language impairments may be connected with the fact that males are more visible, and thus more often diagnosed.

==Writing development==

Research in writing development has been limited in psychology.&lt;ref name="Christie, F. 2010"&gt;Christie, F., &amp; Derewianka, B. (2010). School discourse: Learning to write across the years of schooling. Bloomsbury Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In the research that has been conducted, focus has generally centred on the development of written and spoken language and their connection. Spoken and written skills could be considered linked. Researchers believe that children's spoken language influences their written language.&lt;ref name="Kroll, B. M. 1981"&gt;Kroll, B. M. (1981) Developmental relationships between speaking and writing. In Kroll &amp; Vaan (eds) (1981), 32–54&lt;/ref&gt; When a child learns to write they need to master letter formation, spelling, punctuation and they also have to gain an understanding of the structure and the organisational patterns involved in written language.&lt;ref name="Perera, K. 1984"&gt;Perera, K. (1984). Children's writing and reading: Analysing classroom language. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kroll's theory is one of the most significant on children's writing development. He proposed that children's writing development is split into 4 phases. Kroll explicitly states that these phases are 'artificial' in the sense that the boundaries between the phases are imprecise and he recognises that each child is different, thus their development is unique.&lt;ref name="Kroll, B. M. 1981"/&gt; The phases of writing development have been highlighted to give the reader a broad outline of what phases a child goes through during writing development; however when studying an individual's development in depth, the phases may be disregarded to an extent.

The first of Kroll's phases is the preparation for writing phase. In this phase the child is believed to grasp the technical skills needed for writing, allowing them to create the letters needed to write the words the children say. In this initial phase children experience many opportunities to extend their spoken language skills. Speaking and writing are considered fairly separate processes here, as children's writing is less well developed at this stage, whereas their spoken language is becoming more skilled.&lt;ref name="Kroll, B. M. 1981"/&gt;

Kroll considers the second phase in writing development to be consolidation. Here, children begin to consolidate spoken and written language. In this phase children's writing skills rely heavily on their spoken language skills, and their written and spoken language becoming integrated.&lt;ref name="Kroll, B. M. 1981"/&gt; Children's written language skills become stronger as they use their spoken language skills to improve their writing.  Then in turn, when a development in children's written language skills is seen, their spoken language skills have also improved. A child's written language in this phase mirrors their spoken language.&lt;ref name="Kroll, B. M. 1981"/&gt;

In the third phase, differentiation, children begin to learn that written language regularly differs in structure and style from spoken language. The growth from consolidation to differentiation can be challenging for some children to grasp.&lt;ref name="Kroll, B. M. 1981"/&gt; Children can 'struggle with the transformation from the basically overt language of speech to the essentially covert activity of writing'.&lt;ref&gt;Petty 1978 Petty, W. T. The writing of young children. In C. R. Cooper &amp; L. Odell (Eds.), Research on composing: Points of departure. Urbana, Il.: NCTE, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; In this phase, the child learns that writing is generally considered more formal than spoken language, which is thought to be casual and conversational. Here, it is believed that children begin to understand that writing serves a purpose.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kroll, B. M. (1981) Developmental relationships between speaking and writing. In Kroll &amp; Vaan (eds) (1981), 32–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kroll considers the last phase to be the systematic integration phase. A differentiation and integration between the child's speaking and writing can be seen in this phase. This means that speaking and writing have 'well-articulated forms and functions';&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; however, they are also integrated in the sense that they use the same system. As a result of the individual being aware of the audience, context and reason they are communicating, both written and spoken language are able to overlap and take several forms at this stage.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Kroll used the four phases to give an explanation and generalise about the development of these two aspects of language. The highest significance is placed on the second and third phase, consolidation and differentiation respectively.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It could be concluded that children's written and spoken language, in certain respects, become more similar to age, maturation, and experience; however, they are also increasingly different in other respects. The content of the skills are more similar, but the approach used for both writing and speaking are different.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; When writing and speaking development is looked at more closely it can be seen that certain elements of written and spoken language are differentiating and other elements are integrating, all in the same phase.

Perera conducted a survey and her view mirrors that of Kroll to the extent that she used Kroll's four phases.&lt;ref name="Perera, K. 1984"/&gt; When a child undergoes initial learning of the written language, they have not yet fully mastered the oral language.&lt;ref name="Perera, K. 1984"/&gt; It is clear that their written language development is aided by their spoken language; it can also be said that their spoken language development is aided by the development of their written language skills.  Kantor and Rubin believe that not all individuals successfully move into the final stage of integration.&lt;ref&gt;Kantor, K. J. &amp; Rubin, D. L. (1981) Between speaking and writing: processes of differentiation. In Kroll &amp; Vaan (eds) (1981), 55–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Perera is also aware that it is hard to assign chronological ages to each phase of writing development, because each child is an individual, and also the phases are 'artificial'.

Other than Kroll's theory, there are four principles on early patterns in writing development discussed by Marie Clay in her book ''What Did I Write?''. The four principles are recurring principle, the generative principle, the sign principle, and the inventory principle. The recurring principle involves patterns and shapes in English writing that develop throughout writing development. The generative principle incorporates the idea that a writer can create new meanings by organizing units of writing and letters of the alphabet. The sign principle is understanding that the word print also involves paper arrangement and word boundaries. And lastly, the inventory principle is the fact that children have the urge to list and name items that they are familiar with, and because of this they can practice their own writing skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sulzby|first=Elizabeth|last2=Teale|first2=William H.|date=1985|title=Writing Development in Early Childhood|jstor=42925853|journal=Educational Horizons|volume=64|issue=1|pages=8–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research has also explored writing development. Myhill concentrated on the development of written language skills in adolescents aged 13 to 15.&lt;ref name="Myhill, D. 2008"&gt;Myhill, D. (2008). Towards a linguistic model of sentence development in writing. Language and Education, 22(5), 271–288.&lt;/ref&gt; Myhill discovered that the more mature writer was aware of the shaping of text, and used non-finite clauses, which mirrored Perera's results (1984).&lt;ref name="Myhill, D. 2008"/&gt; Other researchers focused on writing development up until late adolescence, as there has been a limited research in this area.&lt;ref name="Christie, F. 2010"/&gt; Chrisite and Derewianke recognize that the survey conducted by Perera (1984) is still one of the most significant research studies in the writing development field and believe Perera's study is similar to theirs. Chrisite and Derewianke (2010) again propose four phases of writing development. The researchers believe that the process of writing development does not stop when an individual leaves formal education, and again, the researchers highlight that these phases are flexible in their onset. The first phase focuses on spoken language as the main aid for writing development, and the development then takes its course reaching the fourth phase, which continues beyond formal education.&lt;ref name="Christie, F. 2010"/&gt;

==Environmental influences==
The environment a child develops in has influences on language development. The environment provides language input for the child to process. Speech by adults to children help provide the child with correct language usage repetitively.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paul|first=Rhea|last2=Elwood|first2=Terril J.|date=1991-10-01|title=Maternal Linguistic Input to Toddlers With Slow Expressive Language Development|url=https://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1779056|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|language=en|volume=34|issue=5|pages=982–988|doi=10.1044/jshr.3405.982|issn=1092-4388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental influences on language development are explored in the tradition of [[social interactionist theory]] by such researchers as [[Jerome Bruner]], [[Alison Gopnik]], [[Andrew Meltzoff]], [[Anat Ninio]], [[Roy Pea]], [[Catherine E. Snow|Catherine Snow]], Ernest Moerk and [[Michael Tomasello]]. [[Jerome Bruner]] who laid the foundations of this approach in the 1970s, emphasized that adult "[[scaffolding]]" of the child's attempts to master linguistic communication is an important factor in the developmental process.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

One component of the young child's linguistic environment is [[child-directed speech]] (also known as baby talk or motherese), which is language spoken in a higher pitch than normal with simple words and sentences. Although the importance of its role in developing language has been debated, many linguists think that it may aid in capturing the infant's attention and maintaining communication.&lt;ref name="Mani, Plunkett, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mani|first1=Nivedita|last2=Plunkett|first2=Kim|title=Twelve-Month-Olds Know Their Cups From Their Keps and Tups |journal=Infancy|volume=15 |issue=5|year=2010 |pages=445–470|issn=1525-0008 |doi=10.1111/j.1532-7078.2009.00027.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; When children begin to communicate with adults, this motherese speech allows the child the ability to discern the patterns in language and to experiment with language.

Throughout existing research, it is concluded that children exposed to extensive vocabulary and complex grammatical structures more quickly develop language and also have a more accurate syntax than children raised in environments without complex grammar exposed to them.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HOFF|first=E|title=How social contexts support and shape language development☆|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0273229705000316|journal=Developmental Review|volume=26|issue=1|pages=55–88|doi=10.1016/j.dr.2005.11.002|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; With motherese, the mother talks to the child and responds back to the child, whether it be a babble the child made or a short sentence. While doing this, the adult prompts the child to continue communicating, which may help a child develop language sooner than children raised in environments where communication is not fostered.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nathanson|first=Amy I.|last2=Rasmussen|first2=Eric E.|date=2011-10-01|title=TV Viewing Compared to Book Reading and Toy Playing Reduces Responsive Maternal Communication with Toddlers and Preschoolers|url=https://academic.oup.com/hcr/article/37/4/465-487/4107512|journal=Human Communication Research|language=en|volume=37|issue=4|pages=465–487|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2011.01413.x|issn=0360-3989}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[Baby talk|Child-directed speech]] concentrates on small core vocabulary, here and now topics, exaggerated facial expressions and gestures, frequent questioning, para-linguistic changes, and verbal rituals.&lt;ref name="Owens 2012"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Owens | first1 = Robert E. | title = Language development : an introduction | date = 2012 | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston | isbn = 978-0-13-258252-0 | oclc = 682896734 | pages = 130–135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An infant is least likely to produce vocalizations when changed, fed, or rocked. The infant is more likely to produce vocalizations in response to a nonverbal behavior such as touching or smiling.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Child-directed speech also catches the child's attention, and in situations where words for new objects are being expressed to the child, this form of speech may help the child recognize the speech cues and the new information provided.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Data shows that children raised in highly verbal families had higher language scores than those children raised in low verbal families{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}. Continuously hearing complicated sentences throughout language development increases the child's ability to understand these sentences and then to use complicated sentences as they develop. Studies have shown that students enrolled in high language classrooms have two times the growth in complex sentences usage than students in classrooms where teachers do not frequently use complex sentences.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Adults use strategies other than child-directed speech like recasting, expanding, and labeling:
* '''Recasting''' is rephrasing something the child has said, perhaps turning it into a question or restating the child's immature utterance in the form of a fully grammatical sentence. For example, a child saying "cookie now" a parent may respond with "Would you like a cookie now?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicholas|first=Howard|last2=Lightbown|first2=Patsy M.|last3=Spada|first3=Nina|date=2001-12-01|title=Recasts as Feedback to Language Learners|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0023-8333.00172/abstract|journal=Language Learning|language=en|volume=51|issue=4|pages=719–758|doi=10.1111/0023-8333.00172|issn=1467-9922}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Expanding''' is restating, in a linguistically sophisticated form, what a child has said. For example, a child may say "car move road" and the parent may respond "A car drives on the road."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} 
* '''Labeling''' is identifying the names of objects.&lt;ref name="Santrock, 2007" /&gt; If a child points to an object such as a couch the mother may say "couch" in response. Labeling can also be characterized as referencing.&lt;ref name="Owens 2012" /&gt;
Some language development experts have characterized child directed speech in stages. Primarily, the parents use repetition and also variation to maintain the infant's attention. Secondly, the parent simplifies speech to help in language learning. Third, any speech modifications maintain the responsiveness of the child. These modifications develop into a conversation that provides context for the development.&lt;ref name="Owens 2012" /&gt;

===Cultural and socioeconomic effects===
While most children throughout the world develop language at similar rates and without difficulty, cultural and socioeconomic differences have been shown to influence development.  An example of cultural differences in language development can be seen when comparing the interactions of mothers in the United States with their infants with mothers in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tamis-LeMonda|first=Catherine S.|last2=Bornstein|first2=Marc H.|last3=Cyphers|first3=Lisa|last4=Toda|first4=Sueko|last5=Ogino|first5=Misako|date=2016-06-30|title=Language and Play at One Year: A Comparison of Toddlers and Mothers in the United States and Japan|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Development|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=19–42|doi=10.1177/016502549201500102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mothers in the United States use more questions, are more information-oriented, and use more grammatically correct utterances with their 3-month-olds.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  Mothers in Japan, on the other hand, use more physical contact with their infants, and more emotion-oriented, nonsense, and environmental sounds, as well as baby talk, with their infants.  These differences in interaction techniques reflect differences in "each society's assumptions about infants and adult-to-adult cultural styles of talking."&lt;ref name="Owens 2012"/&gt;

Specifically in North American culture, maternal race, education, and socioeconomic class influence parent-child interactions in the early linguistic environment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  When speaking to their infants, mothers from middle class "incorporate language goals more frequently in their play with their infants," and in turn, their infants produce twice as many vocalizations as lower class infants.&lt;ref name="Owens 2012"/&gt; Mothers from higher social classes who are better educated also tend to be more verbal, and have more time to spend engaging with their infants in language.  Additionally, lower class infants may receive more language input from their siblings and peers than from their mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burchinal|first=Margaret R.|last2=Roberts|first2=Joanne E.|last3=Nabors|first3=Laura A.|last4=Bryant|first4=Donna M.|date=1996|title=Quality of Center Child Care and Infant Cognitive and Language Development|jstor=1131835|journal=Child Development|volume=67|issue=2|pages=606–620|doi=10.2307/1131835}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Social preconditions==
It is crucial that children are allowed to socially interact with other people who can vocalize and respond to questions. For language acquisition to develop successfully, children must be in an environment that allows them to communicate socially in that language. Children who have learnt sound, meaning and grammatical system of language that can produce clear sentence may still not have the ability to use language effectively in various social circumstance. Social interaction is the footing stone of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michnik Golinkoff&amp;Hirsh-Pasek|first=Roberta&amp;Kathy|title=How Babies Talk|year=2000|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a few different theories as to why and how children develop language. The most popular—and yet heavily debated—explanation is that language is acquired through imitation. This theory has been challenged by Lester Butler, who argues that children do not use the grammar that an adult would use. Furthermore, "children's language is highly resistant to alteration by adult intervention", meaning that children do not use the corrections given to them by an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butler|first1=Lester G.|title=Language Acquisition of Young Children: Major Theories and Sequences|journal=Elementary English|date=1947|volume=51|issue=8|pages=1120–1123, 1137|jstor=41388312}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most accepted theories in language development are [[psychological]] and [[Functional theories of grammar|functional]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Psychological explanations focus on the mental processes involved in childhood language learning. Functional explanations look at the social processes involved in learning the first language.

==Different aspects==
*'''[[Phonology]]''' involves the rules about the structure and sequence of speech sounds.
*'''[[Semantics]]''' consists of [[vocabulary]] and how concepts are expressed through words.
*'''[[Grammar]]''' involves two parts.
:* The first, '''[[syntax]]''', is the rules in which words are arranged into sentences. 
:* The second, '''[[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]''', is the use of grammatical markers (indicating tense, active or passive voice etc.). 
*'''[[Pragmatics]]''' involves the rules for appropriate and effective communication. Pragmatics involves three skills:
**using language for greeting, demanding etc.,
**changing language for talking differently depending on who it is you are talking to;
**following rules such as turn taking, staying on topic.

Each component has its own appropriate developmental periods.

===Phonological development===
Babies can recognize their mother's voice from as early as few weeks old. It seems like they have a unique system that is designed to recognize speech sound. Furthermore, they can differentiate between certain speech sounds.   A significant first milestone in phonetic development is the babbling stage (around the age of six months). This is the baby's way of practicing his control over that apparatus. Babbling is independent from the language.  Deaf children for instance, babble the same way as hearing ones.
As the baby grows older, the babbling increases in frequency and starts to sound more like words (around the age of twelve months). Although every child is an individual with different pace of mastering speech, there is a tendency to an order of which speech sounds are mastered:
*Vowels before consonants
*Stop sounds before any other consonant sounds (for example: 'p','t','b')
*Place of articulation – labials, alveolar, velars, alveopalatals, and interdentals in that order by the age of 4.  That means that there is some order to the development of the physical system in young children.

==== Early phonetic processes====
As the children's ability to produce sound develops, their ability to perceive the phonetic contrast of their language develops. The better they get in mastering the sound, the more sensitive they become to the changes in those sounds in their language once they get exposed to it. They learn to isolate individual phenomes while speaking which also serves as the basis of reading.

Some processes that occur in early age:

*Syllable deletion – stressed syllables are emphasis that may be given to certain syllables in a word. They are more likely to be retained in children's pronunciation than unstressed syllables (less emphasis on the sound) because they are more salient to children in an early language acquisition process. So children may say ''helikat'' instead of ''helicopter'' or ''fowe'' instead of ''telephone''. That way, they don't pronounce the more emphasized sound in the word.
*Syllable simplification – another process that happens in order to simplify syllable structure, children delete certain sounds systematically. For example, children might say 'tap' instead of "stop" and completely drop the 's' sound in that word. That is a common process in children's speech development.
*Substitution – systematic replacement of one sound by an alternative, easier one to articulate (substitution process – stopping, fronting, gliding). It means that the young toddler may use sounds that are easier to produce instead of the proper sound in a word. We may see that the child replace the 'r' sound with 'l' or 'w', the 'n' with 'd' and so on.
* Assimilation – modification of segments of the word influenced by neighboring sounds, due to ease of articulation. In order for the young speaker to produce sounds easier, he or she may replace the sound in a specific word to a different one, which is somewhat similar. For example, the word "pig" may sound as "big" – 'p' and 'b' are close in their sound. (Lightbown, Spada, Ranta &amp; Rand, 2006).

From shortly after birth to around one year, the baby starts to make speech sounds. 
At around two months, the baby engages in cooing, which mostly consists of vowel sounds. At around four to six months, cooing turns into [[babbling]], which is the repetitive [[consonant]]-[[vowel]] combinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.speechclinic.com.au/speech-language-milestones/|title=Speech &amp; Language Milestones – Speech Clinic™|website=Speech Clinic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babies understand more than they are able to say. In this '''0–8 months''' range, the child is engaged in vocal play of vegetative sounds, laughing, and cooing.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Once the child hits the '''8–12 month''', range the child engages in canonical babbling, i.e. dada as well as variegated babbling. This jargon babbling with intonational contours the language being learned.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

From '''12–24 months''', babies can recognize the correct pronunciation of familiar words. Babies also use phonological strategies to simplify word pronunciation. Some strategies include repeating the first consonant-vowel in a multisyllable word ('TV' → 'didi') or deleting unstressed syllables in a multisyllable word ('banana' → 'nana'). Within this first year, two word utterances and two syllable words emerge. This period is often called the '''holophrastic''' stage of development, because one word conveys as much meaning as an entire phrase.  For instance, the simple word "milk" can imply that the child is requesting milk, noting spilled milk, sees a cat drinking milk, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fernandez|first=Eva|title=Fundamentals of Psycholinguistics|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=West Sussex|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that children at this age were capable of comprehending 2-word sentences, producing 2–3 word sentences, and naming basic colors.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luinge|first=Margreet R.|last2=Post|first2=Wendy J.|last3=Wit|first3=Hero P.|last4=Goorhuis-Brouwer|first4=Sieneke M.|date=2006-10-01|title=The Ordering of Milestones in Language Development for Children From 1 to 6 Years of Age|url=https://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1767648|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|language=en|volume=49|issue=5|pages=923–940|doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2006/067)|pmid=17077206|issn=1092-4388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By '''24–30 months''' awareness of rhyme emerges as well as rising intonation.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} One study concludes that children between the ages of 24–30 months typically can produce 3–4 word sentence, create a story when prompted by pictures, and at least 50% of their speech is intelligible.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

By '''36–60 months''', phonological awareness continues to improve as well as pronunciation.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} At this age, children have a considerable experience with language and are able to form simple sentences that are 3 words in length.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They use basic prepositions, pronouns, and plurals. They become immensely creative in their language use and learn to categorize items such as recognizing that a shoe is not a fruit. At this age, children also learn to ask questions and negate sentences to develop these questions. Over time, their syntax gets more and more unique and complex. A study reveals that at this age, a child's speech should be at least 75% intelligible.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

By '''6–10 years''', children can master syllable stress patterns, which helps distinguish slight differences between similar words.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Semantic development===
The average child masters about fifty words by the age of eighteen months.  These might include words such as, milk, water, juice and apple (noun-like words). Afterwards they acquire 12 to 16 words a day. By the age of six, they master about 13 to 14 thousand words.

The most frequent words include adjective-like expressions for displeasure and rejection such as 'no'. They also include social interaction words, such as "please" and "bye".

There are three stages for learning the meaning of new words:

# Whole object assumption: &lt;br/&gt; A new word refers to a whole object. For example, when an eighteen-months old child sees a sheep and his mother points at it and says the word 'sheep', the child infers that the word 'sheep' describes the whole animal and not parts of it (such as color, shape, etc.).
# Type assumption: &lt;br/&gt; A new word refers to a type of thing, not just to a particular thing. For example, when the child hears the word 'sheep' he infers that it is used for the animal type and not only for that particular sheep that he saw.
# Basic level assumption: &lt;br/&gt; A new word refers to objects that are alike in basic ways (appearance, behavior, etc.).

In other words, when the child hears the word "sheep" he overgeneralizes it to other animals that look like sheep by the external appearance, such as white, wooly and four-legged animal.

Contextual clues are a major factor in the child's vocabulary development.

*

The child uses contextual clues to draw inferences about the category and meaning of new words. By doing so, the child distinguishes between names and ordinary nouns.

For example, when an object is presented to the child with the determiner "a" (a cat, a dog, a bottle) he perceives it as an ordinary noun.

However, when the child hears a noun without the determiner, he perceives it as a name, for instance "this is Mary".

Children usually make correct meaning associations with the words that the adults say. However, sometimes they make semantic errors.

There are a few types of semantic errors:

Overextension: When a child says or hears a word, they might associate what they see or hear as more generalized concept than the real meaning of the word. For example, if they say "cat", they might overextend it to other animals with same features.

Underextension: It involves the use of lexical items in an overly restrictive fashion. In other words, the child focuses on core members of a certain category. For example: 'cat' may only refer to the family cat and no other cat, or 'dog' may refer to certain kinds of dogs that the child is exposed to.

Verb meaning: when a pre-school child hears the verb 'fill', he understands it as the action 'pour' rather than the result, which is 'make full'.

Dimensional terms: the first dimensional adjectives acquired are big and small because they belong to the size category. The size category is the most general one. Later children acquire the single dimension adjectives, such as, tall-short, long-short, high-low. Eventually they acquire the adjectives that describe the secondary dimension, such as thick-thin, wide-narrow and deep-shallow.

From birth to one year, comprehension (the language we understand) develops before production (the language we use). There is about a 5-month lag in between the two. Babies have an innate preference to listen to their mother's voice. Babies can recognize familiar words and use preverbal gestures.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Within the first '''12–18 months''' semantic roles are expressed in one word speech including agent, object, location, possession, nonexistence and denial. Words are understood outside of routine games but the child still needs contextual support for lexical comprehension.&lt;ref name="Brandone 2006"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Brandone | first1 = Amanda C | last2 = Salkind | first2 = Sara J. | last3 = Golinkoff | first3 = Roberta Michnick | last4 = Hirsh-Pasek | first4 = Kathy | title = Language Development | editors = George G Bear; Kathleen M Minke | work = Children's needs III : development, prevention, and intervention | publisher = National Association of School Psychologists | year = 2006 | location = Bethesda, Md | accessdate = 2013-12-09 | isbn = 9780932955791 | oclc = 70691810| url=http://udel.edu/~roberta/pdfs/Bear%20chaptBrandone.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''18–24 months''' Prevalent relations are expressed such as agent-action, agent-object, action-location.&lt;ref name="Brandone 2006"/&gt;
Also, there is a vocabulary spurt between 18–24 months, which includes fast mapping. Fast mapping is the babies' ability to learn a lot of new things quickly. The majority of the babies' new vocabulary consists of object words (nouns) and action words (verbs).

'''30–36 months''' The child is able to use and understand why question and basic spatial terms such as in, on or under.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

'''36–42 months''' There is an understanding of basic color words and kinship terms. Also, the child has an understanding of the semantic relationship between adjacent and conjoined sentences, including casual and contrastive.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

'''42–48 months''' When and how questions are comprehended as well as basic shape words such as circle, square and triangle.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

'''48–60 months''' Knowledge of letter names and sounds emerges, as well as numbers.

By '''3–5 years''', children usually have difficulty using words correctly. Children experience many problems such as underextensions, taking a general word and applying it specifically (for example, 'cartoons' specifically for 'Mickey Mouse') and overextensions, taking a specific word and applying it too generally (example, 'ant' for any insect). However, children coin words to fill in for words not yet learned (for example, someone is a cooker rather than a chef because a child may not know what a chef is). Children can also understand metaphors.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

From '''6–10 years''', children can understand meanings of words based on their definitions. They also are able to appreciate the multiple meanings of words and use words precisely through metaphors and puns. Fast mapping continues.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
Within these years, children are now able to acquire new information from written texts and can explain relationships between multiple meaning words. Common idioms are also understood.

=== Syntactic development ===
The development of syntactic structures follows a particular pattern and reveals much on the nature of language acquisition, which has several stages. According to O'Grady and Cho (2011), the first stage, occurring between the ages of 12–18 months, is called "one-word stage." In this stage, children cannot form syntactic sentences and therefore use one-word utterances called "holophrases" that express an entire sentence. In addition, children's comprehension is more advanced than their production abilities. For example, a child who wants candy may say "candy" instead of expressing a full sentence.

The following stage is the "two-word stage" in which children begin to produce "mini-sentences" that are composed of two words, such as "doggy bark" and "Ken water" (O'Grady &amp; Cho, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;346). At this stage, it is unclear whether children have an understanding of underlying rules of the language such as syntactic categories, since their "mini-sentences" often lack distinction between the categories. However, children do exhibit sensitivity to sentence structures and they frequently use appropriate word order.

After several months of speech that is restricted to short utterances, children enter the "telegraphic stage" and begin to produce longer and more complex grammatical structures (O'Grady &amp; Cho, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;347). This stage is characterized by production of complex structures as children begin to form phrases consisting of a subject and a complement in addition to use of modifiers and composition of full sentences. Children use mostly content words and their sentences lack function words. For example, a child may say "fill cup water," instead of saying, "Fill my cup with water." Subsequently, language acquisition continues to develop rapidly and children begin to acquire complex grammar that shows understanding of intricate linguistic features, such as the ability to switch the position of words in sentences.

Throughout the process of syntactic development, children acquire and develop question structures. According to O'Grady and Cho (2011), at the early stages of language acquisition, children ask yes-no questions by rising intonation alone as they develop awareness to auxiliary verbs only at a later stage. When auxiliary verbs make their appearance, it takes children a few months before they are able to use inversion in yes-no questions. The development of WH- questions occurs between the ages of two and four, when children acquire auxiliary verbs that then leads to the ability to use inversion in questions. However, some children find inversion easier in yes-no questions than in WH- questions, since the position of the WH- word and the auxiliary verb both must changed (e.g., "You are going where?" instead of "Where are you going?").

=== Morphological development ===
Morphological structures development occurs over a period of several years. Before language is acquired, children lack any use of morphological structures.

The morphological structures that children acquire during their childhood, and even up to the early school years, are: determiners (a, the), -ing inflection, plural –s, auxiliary be, possessive –s, third person singular –s, past tense –ed).

When children start using them they tend to overgeneralize the rules and project them upon all the words in the language, including irregulars. For example: if a child knows the –ed (past tense) there is a possibility that they'll say "I eated"( Man-mans cat-cats). These errors result from overgeneralization of rules.

This overgeneralization is very noticeable, in fact, children do that in less than 25 percent of the time at any point before reducing that percentage. Then they improve their mastery, which can be tested in various ways, such as the "wug test" (Berko, 1958).

Children often figure out quickly frequent irregular verbs, such as go and buy rather than less common ones, such as win. This suggests that children must hear the word several hundred times before they are able to use it correctly.

This development of bound morphemes is similar in order among children, for example: -''ing'' is acquired before the article ''the''. The interesting part though is that parents tend to use a different order while speaking to their kids, for example, parents use the article 'the' more frequently than -ing. Meaning, other factors determine the order of acquisition, such as:

# Morphemes that come at the end of an utterance are remembered better.
# Children seem to remember morphemes such as –ing better because they contain their own syllables rather than single consonant morpheme, such as plural –s.
# Affixes with more than one meaning are more difficult to acquire, e.g., –s functions both as plural noun and singular third.

As it comes to word formation processes such as derivation and compounding, the earliest derivational suffixes to show up in children's speech are those they hear adults use most frequently. (-er as the *'doer' of the action such as walker.) When it comes to compounds, children first make up names for agents and instruments that they don't know by a pattern (N-N), though some of them do not follow the pattern (*cutter grass for grass cutter). Then, they might have the right structure but the words are inappropriate since English already has words with the intended meaning such as car-smoke = exhaust. This process points to a preference for building words from other words, thus place less demand on memory than learning an entirely new word for each concept.

===Grammatical development===
Grammar describes the way sentences of a language are constructed, which includes both [[syntax]] and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/grammar|title = Grammar|date = |access-date = |website = Dictionary.com|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syntactic development and morphological development====

Syntactic development involves the ways that various morphemes are ordered or combined in sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = the definition of syntactic|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/syntactic|website = Dictionary.com|access-date = 2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Morpheme]]s, which are basic units of meaning in language, get added as children learn to produce simple sentences and become more precise speakers. Morphemes can be whole words (like "happy") or parts of words that change meaning of words ("&lt;u&gt;un"&lt;/u&gt;happy). Brown&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; proposed a stage model that describes the various types of [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] structures that are developed in English and the age range within which they are normally acquired.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.speech-language-therapy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=33:brown&amp;catid=2:uncategorised&amp;Itemid=117|title = Brown's Stages of Syntactic Development|date = 1998|access-date = |website = speech language therapy dot com|publisher = |last = Bowen|first = C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage I:''' From '''15–30 months''', children start using telegraphic speech, which are two word combinations, for example 'wet diaper'. Brown (1973)&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, R. (1973). A first language: The early stages. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; observed that 75% of children's two-word utterances could be summarized in the existence of 11 [[semantic]] relations:&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
*Attributive: 'Big house'
*Agent-action: 'Daddy hit'
*Action-object: 'Hit ball'
*Agent-object: 'Daddy ball'
*Nominative: 'That ball'
*Demonstrative: 'There ball'
*Recurrence: 'More ball'
*Non-existence: 'All-gone ball'
*Possessive: 'Daddy chair'
*Entity + Locative: 'book table'
*Action + Locative: 'go store'
{{div col end}}

'''Stage II:''' At around '''28–36 months''', children begin to engage in the production of simple sentences, usually 3 word sentences. These simple sentences follow syntactic rules and are refined gradually as development&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; continues. The morphological developments seen in this age range include use of present progressive (&lt;u&gt;-ing&lt;/u&gt; endings), the prepositions "in" and "on", and regular plurals (&lt;u&gt;-s&lt;/u&gt; endings).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Stage III:''' Around '''36–42 months''', children continue to add morphemes and gradually produce complex grammatical structures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The morphemes that are added at this age include irregular past tense, possessive ('s), and use of the verb 'to be' (It &lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt;, I &lt;u&gt;am&lt;/u&gt;, etc.).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Stage IV:'''Around '''40–46 months''' children continue to add to their morphological knowledge. This range is associated with use of articles (&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt; or &lt;u&gt;the&lt;/u&gt;), regular past tense (&lt;u&gt;-ed&lt;/u&gt; endings), and regular third person speech (&lt;u&gt;He likes&lt;/u&gt; it).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Stage V:''' Around '''42-52+ months''' children refine the complex grammatical structures and increase their use of morphemes to convey more complex ideas. Children in this stage use irregular third-person speech, the verb 'to be' as an auxiliary verb (She &lt;u&gt;was not&lt;/u&gt; laughing), and in its contraction forms (It&lt;u&gt;'s&lt;/u&gt;, She&lt;u&gt;'s&lt;/u&gt;, etc.).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Pragmatics development===
From birth to one year, babies can engage in [[joint attention]] (sharing the attention of something with someone else). Infants also can engage in turn taking activities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rochat|first=Philippe|last2=Querido|first2=Jane G.|last3=Striano|first3=Tricia|date=1999|title=Emerging sensitivity to the timing and structure of protoconversation in early infancy.|journal=Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=950–957|doi=10.1037//0012-1649.35.4.950|issn=0012-1649}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of their sensitivity to reactive contingency, which can elicit social responses in the babies from very early on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=John S.|date=1972|title=SMILING, COOING, AND "THE GAME"|jstor=23084026|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly of Behavior and Development|volume=18|issue=4|pages=323–339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*By '''1–2 years''', they can engage in conversational turn taking and topic maintenance {{citation needed|date=December 2013}} and understand that turn taking interaction of others can convey relevant, communicative information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tauzin|first=Tibor|last2=Gergely|first2=György|date=2018-06-22|title=Communicative mind-reading in preverbal infants|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27804-4|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|pages=9534|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27804-4|issn=2045-2322|pmc=6015048|pmid=29934630}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*By '''age 3–5''', children can master illocutionary intent, knowing what you meant to say even though you might not have said it and turnabout, which is turning the conversation over to another person.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
*By '''age 6–10''', shading occurs, which is changing the conversation topic gradually. Children are able to communicate effectively in demanding settings, such as on the telephone.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Effect of bilingualism===

There is a large debate regarding whether or not [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]] is truly beneficial to children. Parents of children often view learning a second language throughout elementary and high school education beneficial to the child.&lt;ref name="Bialystok 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Bialystok | first1 = E. | last2 = Craik | first2 = FI. | last3 = Luk | first3 = G. | title = Bilingualism: consequences for mind and brain | journal = Trends Cogn Sci | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 240–50 |date=Apr 2012 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2012.03.001 | pmid = 22464592 | pmc = 3322418 | url = http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:10587326 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another perspective dictates that the second language just confuses the child and prevents them from mastering their primary language.&lt;ref name="Blumenfeld 2009 10"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blumenfeld|first=H|author2=Faroqi-Shah, Y |title=Bilingualism: Consequences for language, cognition, development, and the brain|journal=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|year=2009|volume=14|issue=13|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that American bilingual children have greater [[cognitive flexibility]], better perceptual skills and tend to be divergent thinkers than [[Monolingualism|monolingual]] children between the ages of five to ten.&lt;ref name="Bialystok 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blumenfeld 2009 10"/&gt;  Better executive functioning skills are likely because bilingual children have to choose one language to speak while actively suppressing the other. This builds stronger selective attention and cognitive flexibility because these skills are being exercised more.&lt;ref name = "Poulin-Dubois 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Poulin-Dubois | first1 = D. | last2 = Blayne | first2 = A. | last3 = Coutya |first3= J. | last4 = Bialystok | first4 = E. | title = The effects of bilingualism on todders' executive functioning | journal =  Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 108 | issue =  3 | pages = 567–579 | date = Mar 2011 | doi = 10.1016/j.jcep2010.10.009 | doi-broken-date = 2018-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, bilingual children have a better understanding of universal language concepts, such as grammar, because these concepts are applied in multiple languages.&lt;ref name = "Katsos 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Katsos | first1 = N. | last2 = Ezeisabarrena | first2 = MJ. | last3 = Gavarró | first3 = A. | last4 = Kraljević | first4 = JK. | last5 = Hrzica | first5 = G. | last6 = Noveck | first6 = I. | title = The acquisition of quantification across languages: some predictions. | journal = Cascadilla Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies comparing Swedish-Finnish bilingual children and Swedish monolingual children between the ages of five to seven have also shown that the bilingual children have a smaller vocabulary than monolingual children.&lt;ref name="Korkman 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Korkman | first1 = M. | last2 = Stenroos | first2 = M. | last3 = Mickos | first3 = A. | last4 = Westman | first4 = M. | last5 = Ekholm | first5 = P. | last6 = Byring | first6 = R. | title = Does simultaneous bilingualism aggravate children's specific language problems? | journal = Acta Paediatr | volume = 101 | issue = 9 | pages = 946–52 |date=Sep 2012 | doi = 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2012.02733.x | pmid = 22591054 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study throughout America, elementary school English-monolingual children performed better in mathematics and reading activities than their non-English-dominant bilingual and non-English monolingual peers from kindergarten to grade five.&lt;ref name="Han 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Han | first1 = WJ. | title = Bilingualism and academic achievement. | journal = Child Dev | volume = 83 | issue = 1 | pages = 300–21 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01686.x | pmid = 22098584 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning two languages simultaneously can be beneficial or a hindrance to a child's language and intellectual development.  Further research is necessary to continue to shed light on this debate.

In addition to the study of bilingualism in children, similar research is being conducted in adults. Research findings show that although bilingual benefits are muted in middle adulthood,&lt;ref name="Bialystok 2012" /&gt; they are more profound in older age when those who develop dementia experience onset about 4.5 years later in bilingual subjects.&lt;ref name = "Alladi 2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alladi | first1 = S. | last2 = Bak | first2 = TH. | last3 = Duggirala | first3 = V. | last4 = Surampudi | first4 = B. | last5 = Shailaja | first5 = M. | last6 = Shukla | first6 = AK. | last7 = Kaul | first7 = S. | title = Bilingualism delays age at onset of dementia, independent of education and immigration status | journal = Neurology | volume = 18 | issue = 20 | pages = 1938–1944 | date = Nov 2013 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000436620.33155a4 | doi-broken-date = 2018-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased attentional control, inhibition, and conflict resolution developed from bilingualism may be accountable for the later onset of dementia.&lt;ref name="Bialystok 2012" /&gt;

==== Misdiagnoses as a language impairment ====
There is some research that demonstrates that bilingualism may often be misdiagnosed as a language impairment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kohnert|first=K|date=2010|title=Bilingual children with primary language impairment: Issues, evidence, and implications for clinical actions|url=|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|volume=15 |issue=1|pages=20–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subtopic of bilingualism in the literature is nonstandard varieties of English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stockman|first=Ida J.|date=2010-01-01|title=A Review of Developmental and Applied Language Research on African American Children: From a Deficit to Difference Perspective on Dialect Differences|url=https://lshss.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1782696|journal=Language, Speech, and Hearing Services in Schools|language=en|volume=41|issue=1|pages=23–38|doi=10.1044/0161-1461(2009/08-0086)|pmid=20051577|issn=0161-1461}}&lt;/ref&gt; While bilingualism and nonstandard varieties of English cannot be considered a true language impairment, they are misrepresented in the population of those receiving language interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dockrell|first=Julie E.|last2=Marshall|first2=Chloë R.|date=2015-05-01|title=Measurement Issues: Assessing language skills in young children|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/camh.12072|journal=Child and Adolescent Mental Health|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=116–125|doi=10.1111/camh.12072|issn=1475-3588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language disorders ==
A '''[[language disorder]]''' is the impaired comprehension and or use of a spoken, written, and/or other symbol system. A disorder may involve problems in the following areas: 
#The form of language i.e. [[phonology]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], or [[syntax]] {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
#The content i.e. semantics{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
#The function of language in communication i.e. pragmatics {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Olswang and colleagues have identified a series of behaviors in children in the '''18–36 month''' range that are predictors for the need of language intervention.&lt;ref name="Olswang 1998"&gt;{{Cite web  | last1=Olswang| first1 = Lesley B |last2 = Rodriguez| first2=Barbara| last3=Timler| first3=Geralyn| title = Recommending Intervention for Toddlers With Specific Language Learning Difficulties | url =http://courses.washington.edu/sop/RecInterventionToddlers.pdf  | publisher = American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology| volume= 7 | pages= 23–32 | date = 1998| accessdate = 9 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These predictors include: 
* A smaller than average vocabulary 
* A language comprehension delay of 6 months or a comprehension deficit with a large comprehension production gap 
* Phonological problems such as restricted [[babbling]] or limited vocalizations 
* Few spontaneous vocal imitations and reliance on direct modeling in imitation tasks 
* Little combinatorial or symbolic play 
* Few communicative or symbolic gestures 
* Behavior problems&lt;ref name="Olswang 1998"/&gt;

Some of the many conditions that cause language development problems include:

The '''Lara-Falcón dry forests''' (NT0219) is an ecoregion that extends inland from the [[Caribbean]] coast of northwestern Venezuela.
To the east and west the dry forests of the hilly region transition into xeric shrublands.
There are several endemic bird species including the vulnerable [[yellow-shouldered amazon]], in demand as a pet.
There are few protected areas.
Despite the relatively infertile soils, a large part of the ecoregion has been converted to farmland or pasturage.

==Geography==

===Location===
{{location map|Venezuela|relief=yes|lat_deg=10.879 |lon_deg=-69.152 |caption=Location in Venezuela|width=220px}}
The Lara-Falcón dry forests ecoregion is in parts of the states of [[Lara (state)|Lara]] and [[Falcón]].{{sfn|Locklin}}
It has an area of {{convert|1,683,492|ha}}.
It is south of the [[Paraguaná Peninsula]] and north of the [[Venezuelan Andes]] to the east of [[Lake Maracaibo]].
It extends from just south of [[Coro, Venezuela|Coro]], Falcón state, to just north of [[Barquisimeto]], Lara state.{{sfn|Lara-Falcón dry forests – Myers|loc=WWF Abstract}}
The ecoregion extends to the Caribbean sea in the northeast, with patches of [[Amazon-Orinoco-Southern Caribbean mangroves]] along some sections of the shore.
To the southeast it transitions into the [[La Costa xeric shrublands]] and a section of the [[Cordillera de la Costa montane forests]].
To the south, west and northwest it gives way to [[Paraguana xeric scrub]].{{sfn|WildFinder – WWF}}

===Terrain===

The Lara-Falcón dry forests ecoregion contains the Sierra de San Luis, the most eastern part of the [[Sierra de Falcón]].
In the south it reaches the [[Sierra de Aroa]].
The mountains, valleys and plains have elevations of {{convert|100-1300|m}} above sea level.
There are varied microclimates at different elevations.
Soils are relatively infertile [[ultisol]]s and [[oxisol]]s.
Major rivers include the [[Hueque River|Hueque]], [[Tocuyo River|Tocuyo]] and [[Aroa River (Venezuela)|Aroa]].{{sfn|Locklin}}

===Climate===

Mean temperatures is {{convert|27-28|C}}.
Annual rainfall is {{convert|300-1000|mm}}.{{sfn|Locklin}}
At a sample location at coordinates {{coord|10.75|-69.25}} the [[Köppen climate classification]] is "Aw": equatorial, winter dry.{{sfn|Lara-Falcón dry forests – Myers|loc=Climate Data}}
Mean temperatures at this location range from {{convert|24.5|C}} in January to {{convert|26.8|C}} in September.
Total annual rainfall varies considerably from one year to another, but averages about {{convert|850|mm}}.
Monthly rainfall varies from {{convert|8.9|mm}} in February to {{convert|129.3|mm}} in July.{{sfn|Lara-Falcón dry forests – Myers|loc=Climate Data}}

==Ecology==

The Lara-Falcón dry forests ecoregion is in the [[Neotropical realm|neotropical]] realm, in the [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests]] biome.{{sfn|Lara-Falcón dry forests – Myers|loc=WWF Abstract}}
At a global level, tropical dry forests are the third most critically endangered biome. 48.5 % of the biome has been cleared and only 7.6 % is protected.{{sfn|Oatham|Boodram|2006|p=272}}

===Flora===
[[File:Parque Nacional Cueva de la Quebrada del Toro.jpg|thumb|Cueva de la Quebrada del Toro National Park]]
The vegetation is adapted to the dry climate and includes dense deciduous dry forest and thorn forest with [[cactus|cacti]], [[mesquite]] trees and spiny shrubs.
Small patches of seasonal evergreen woodland are found along rivers and on hilltops.{{sfn|Lara-Falcón dry forests – Myers|loc=WWF Abstract}}
The varied microclimates support a variety of types of vegetation including seasonal evergreen lowland forest in the southeast, similar to that found in the [[Cordillera de la Costa montane forests]], dry deciduous lowland forest and submontane forest.{{sfn|Locklin}}
The upper slopes and summits of the Sierra San Luis contain dense, medium height cloud forests, with two strata of trees and a dense understory.{{sfn|Kunkel|Linden|Beudels|Elst|1996|p=265}}
The dry deciduous forests of the Lara–Falcon hills are fairly open, {{convert|8-15|m}} high, and have dense undergrowth.
The main flora are  ''[[Handroanthus billbergii]]'', ''[[Roseodendron chryseum]]'' (araguán), ''[[Bulnesia arborea]]'' (Maracaibo lignum vitae), ''[[Bourreria cumanensis]]'', ''[[Caesalpinia coriaria]]'' (divi-divi), ''[[Pereskia guamacho]]'' (leafy cactus) and ''[[Prosopis juliflora]]'' (mesquite).{{sfn|Kunkel|Linden|Beudels|Elst|1996|p=285}}

===Fauna===

The only endemic mammal is the [[Guajira mouse opossum]] (''Marmosa xerophila''), found in this and other dry forest ecoregions in the north of Venezuela and Colombia.
It is mostly found in the deciduous forest.
There are many endemic birds in the arid lowland area including the [[yellow-shouldered amazon]] (''Amazona barbadensis''), [[Maracaibo tody-flycatcher]] (''Todirostrum viridanum''), [[pygmy palm swift]] (''Tachornis furcata''), [[buffy hummingbird]] (''Leucippus fallax''), [[chestnut piculet]] (''Picumnus cinnamomeus''), [[white-whiskered spinetail]] (''Synallaxis candei''), [[black-backed antshrike]] (''Thamnophilus melanonotus''), [[slender-billed inezia]] (''Inezia tenuirostris''), [[Tocuyo sparrow]] (''Arremonops tocuyensis'') and [[vermilion cardinal]] (''Cardinalis phoeniceus'').{{sfn|Locklin}}
Endangered birds include the [[plain-flanked rail]] (''Rallus wetmorei'') and the [[red siskin]] (''Spinus cucullatus'').{{sfn|Lara-Falcón dry forests – Myers|loc=All Endangered}}

==Status==

The [[World Wildlife Fund]] gives the ecoregion the status of "Critical/Endangered".
The habitat has badly damaged by farming and grazing, particularly the north and center of the region.
The vulnerable yellow-shouldered amazon is illegally collected for sale as a pet.{{sfn|Locklin}}
As of 2002 of the {{convert|17447.4|km2}} in the ecoregion, {{convert|6074.1|km2}} or 34.8% had natural cover or extractive land use, while the remainder had been converted to agricultural land, including pasturage.{{sfn|De Ferranti|2005|p=91}}
A 2006 book stated that of the {{convert|17563.25|km2}} of the ecoregion, 64.6% of the habitat had been transformed by human activity.
Only 8.1% or {{convert|1427.3|km2}} was protected.{{sfn|Zimmerer|2006|p=220}}
The {{convert|8500|ha}} [[Cueva de la Quebrada del Toro National Park]] protects the portion of the ecoregion in the Sierra de Falcón, including a dramatic cave.{{sfn|Locklin}}
The [[Juan Crisóstomo Falcón National Park]] also protects part of the region.{{sfn|Lara-Falcón dry forests – Myers|loc=WWF Abstract}}

Present day [[Bangladesh]], due to its unique geographic location, suffers from devastating [[tropical cyclone]]s frequently. The funnel-shaped northern portion of the [[Bay of Bengal]] amplifies the [[storm surge]] of landfalling tropical cyclones, affecting thousands of people. Some of the most devastating natural disasters in recorded history with high casualties were tropical cyclones that hit the region now comprising present-day Bangladesh. Among them, the [[1970 Bhola cyclone]] alone claimed approximately 300,000 to 500,000 lives, making it the deadliest tropical cyclone on record.

==Storm preparedness==
Bangladesh lacks any satellites of its own. The three satellite ground stations, in Betbunia, Talibabad, and [[Mohakhali]], are used to receive feeds from other satellites. Bangladesh Space Research and Remote Sensing Organisation (SPARRSO), a government agency under the Ministry of Defence&lt;ref name="sparrso"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chowdhury |first=Masud Hasan |year=2012 |chapter=SPARRSO |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=SPARRSO |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides storm predictions and early warnings using feeds from [[NASA]] and [[NOAA]]'s satellites. The warnings are usually given in a scale of 10, with 10 being used for the deadliest storms.

A detailed program for storm prevention was outlined by the government following the cyclone of 1991. A Comprehensive Cyclone Preparedness Programme (CPP) is jointly planned, operated, and managed by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief and the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society; a volunteer force of more than 32,000 are trained to help in warning and evacuation in the coastal areas.&lt;ref name="bpd"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chowdhury |first=Masud Hasan |year=2012 |chapter=Cyclone |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Cyclone |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2,500 cyclone shelters have been constructed in the coastal regions. The shelters are built on elevated platforms and serve the dual role of schools or community centers during normal weather. In [[Patenga]], [[Chittagong]], the coast has been heavily protected with concrete levees. Also, afforestation has been initiated in the coastal regions to create a green belt.

{{IUCN Chromista chart}}
{{As of|July 2016}}, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) has evaluated the conservation status of 15 species within [[Chromista]].&lt;ref name=IUCNDATA&gt;{{cite web|title=IUCN Red List version 2016.1 |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/ |website=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species |publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) |accessdate=4 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627000000/http://www.iucnredlist.org/ |archivedate=27 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The IUCN has not evaluated any [[protist]] species other than those in Chromista. No Chromista subspecies or subpopulations have been evaluated.  No evaluated Chromista species are confirmed to be [[Extinction|extinct]], but four are tagged as possibly extinct.

{{As of|2005}} the [[New Zealand Threat Classification System]] has evaluated 38 species of [[macroalgae]] as Threatened and 23 as Data Deficient.&lt;ref name="NZTCS05"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hitchmough|first1=Rod|last2=Bull|first2=Leigh|last3=Cromarty|first3=Pam|title=New Zealand Threat Classification System lists 2005|date=January 2007|publisher=Science &amp; Technical Publishing Department of Conservation|location=Wellington, NZ|isbn=978-0478141283|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/Documents/science-and-technical/sap236.pdf|accessdate=2 February 2018|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these species are only of concern nationally.&lt;ref name="NZTCS05"/&gt;

This is a '''list of the [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs) in [[Humberside]]''', England. In England the body responsible for designating SSSIs is [[Natural England]], which chooses a site because of its [[fauna]], [[plant|flora]], [[geology|geological]] or physiographical features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Notification of SSSIs | work=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/special/sssi/notification.cfm | accessdate=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the county of Humberside no longer exists, Natural England uses its former borders to mark an [[Area of Search]].&lt;ref&gt;Nature Conservancy Council (1989) Guidelines for selection of biological SSSIs {{ISBN|0-86139-544-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2012}}, there are 72 sites designated in this Area of Search, of which 51 have been designated due to their biological interest, 17 due to their geological interest, and 4 for both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SSSIs in Humberside | work=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/special/sssi/searchresults.cfm?sssi_name=&amp;frmcounty=1022 | accessdate=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural England took over the role of designating and managing SSSIs from [[English Nature]] in October 2006 when it was formed from the amalgamation of English Nature, parts of the [[Countryside Agency]] and the [[Rural Development Service]]. Natural England, like its predecessor, uses the [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|1974&amp;ndash;1996 county system]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=County search of SSSIs | work=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/Special/sssi/search.cfm | accessdate=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such the same approach is followed here. There are four unitary authorities in the Humberside Area of Search: [[Kingston upon Hull]] and [[East Riding of Yorkshire]] cover North Humberside, and [[North Lincolnshire]] and [[North East Lincolnshire]] cover South Humberside. The SSSI list for [[List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Lincolnshire|Lincolnshire]] does not include the sites on this list.

The data in the table is taken from Natural England in the form of citation sheets for each SSSI, and the County Background Datasheet for Humberside.&lt;ref name="data"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/reportAction.cfm?Report=sdrt07&amp;Category=CF&amp;Reference=1022 |title=Natural England County Background datasheet for Humberside SSSIs|accessdate= 30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For other counties, see [[List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest by Area of Search]].

This '''list of carnivorous plants''' is a comprehensive listing of all known [[carnivorous plant]] species, of which more than 750 are currently recognised.&lt;ref&gt;Lowrie, A. (2013). Preface. In: ''[[Carnivorous Plants of Australia|Carnivorous Plants of Australia Magnum Opus - Volume One]]''. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. pp.&amp;nbsp;xi–xiii. {{ISBN|978-1-908787-11-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unless otherwise stated it is based on [[Jan Schlauer]]'s [http://www.omnisterra.com/bot/cp_home.cgi Carnivorous Plant Database]. Extinct [[taxon|taxa]] are denoted with a [[Dagger (typography)|dagger]] (†).

Some of the species on this list may not satisfy certain strict definitions of plant carnivory, and could alternatively be characterised as merely [[Protocarnivorous plant|''paracarnivorous'' or ''protocarnivorous'']].

==Extinct species==
===''[[Aldrovanda]]''===
Numerous extinct species of ''Aldrovanda'' have been described, all of which are known only from fossil [[pollen]] and seeds (with the exception of ''A.&amp;nbsp;inopinata'', which is also known from fossilised laminae).

===†''Archaeamphora''===
[[Image:Archaeamphora longicervia.png|thumb|Artist's restoration of ''[[Archaeamphora longicervia]]''.]]
This genus contains a single extinct species, described from fossilised leaf material. The identification of ''Archaeamphora'' as a pitcher plant (and therefore carnivorous plant) has been questioned by a number of authors.&lt;ref name=McPherson2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=eggs&gt;Heřmanová, Z. &amp; J.

'''Marineland of New Zealand''' was a [[marine mammal park]] in [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]], New Zealand. The park opened in 1965 and closed to the public in 2008. It has had several species of native marine wildlife, including the [[common dolphin]], the New Zealand [[fur seal]], little blue penguin and [[gannet]]s.  Marineland also has California sea lions, a sulphur crested [[cockatoo]], [[otter]]s and more.

==History==

===1960s===
[[Image:Main Tank Marineland.jpg|thumb|left|The main tank at Marineland which was completed in January 1965]]
The history of Marineland began in 1964 when an Auckland architectural firm was commissioned by [[Napier City, New Zealand|Napier City]] under mayor [[Peter Tait (mayor)|Peter Tait]] to design an aquarium and dolphin pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Marineland celebrates its 40th anniversary |url=http://www.insidetourism.co.nz/images/IT530.pdf |publisher=Inside Tourism |accessdate=6 November 2010 |format=PDF |date=21 January 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526092125/http://insidetourism.co.nz/images/IT530.pdf |archivedate=26 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late January 1965 Marineland caught its first [[common dolphin]], Daphne, and the facility opened two days later. In 1969 two dolphins died when vandals broke in and fed them nails.

By the end of the 1960s the site had exhibited dusky dolphins, [[California sea lion]]s, [[leopard seal]]s and [[New Zealand fur seal]]s.

===1970s===
The year 1970 saw [[bottlenose dolphin]]s and [[weddell seal]]s welcomed to the site. In 1976 four small clawed [[otter]]s arrived from [[Melbourne Zoo]]. A year later the current general manager, Gary Macdonald was appointed.

===1980s===
A new grandstand was built and Marineland saw yellow-eyed penguins and little blue penguins lay eggs for the first time including some successful hatchings.

===1990s===
A [[New Zealand Lotteries Commission]] grant was given for a new Marine Education Centre in 1991 and one year later a "Swim With Dolphins" programme began. In 1996 vandals broke into the site for a second time. Redevelopments of many areas and accommodations for animals at the site took place.

===2000s===
Closes to the public in September 2008 when Kelly the last remaining dolphin dies.&lt;ref name="Marineland of New Zealand"&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Release 10 December 2010|url=http://www.marineland.co.nz/|work=Marineland of New Zealand|accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
Marineland is transferred to [[National Aquarium of New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="Marineland of New Zealand"/&gt;

In September 2013, Napier City Council announced that Marineland was to be demolished and replaced with a Skatepark.

*Sulphur crested cockatoo: Called Bobby. Bobby came to Marineland when the park first did the pirate shows in 1988.

==Manager==

The final manager of Napier's Marineland, Gary Macdonald, resigned on 18 November 2009 after 32 years at Marineland after investigations found he falsified documentation to keep wild animals illegally.&lt;ref name="tvnz.co.nz"&gt;http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/marineland-boss-quits-after-falsifying-documents-3165325/video&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/hawkes-bay-today/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503462&amp;objectid=10989122&lt;/ref&gt;

"What I did was totally wrong &amp; I should've been informing DOC of exactly what I was doing," said Mr Macdonald in live statements after the investigation.&lt;ref name="stuff.co.nz"&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/3080564/Marineland-manager-quits-over-false-seal-reports&lt;/ref&gt;
Investigations into the council-owned tourist attraction were started by The Department of Conservation about the false paperwork on 11 November 2009.

Napier City Council chief executive of the time Neil Taylor explained the investigations showed three or more wild seal pups were documented as being born in Marineland, enabling the facility to keep them rather than release the animals back to the wild.

The council probe revealed false declarations were filed in 1996, 2006, and 2007, stating in all cases that the pups had arrived malnourished, harassed, or at risk for treatment.

Marineland has been closed since April 2008 while the council decides the future of the facility.

DOC completed an investigation but decided against prosecution of Marineland, satisfied with Mr Macdonald's resignation.

The '''Medicina Radio Observatory''' is an astronomical observatory located 30&amp;nbsp;km from [[Bologna, Italy]]. It is operated by the Institute for Radio Astronomy of the [[INAF|National Institute for Astrophysics]] (INAF) of the government of Italy.

The site includes:
* 32-metre diameter [[parabolic antenna]] for observing between 1.4 and 23 [[GHz]]. The 32-m antenna is used as a single-dish instrument for [[astrophysical]] observations (such as water and [[methanol]] [[maser]] [[spectroscopy]]), [[SETI]] experiments and radar monitoring of [[Near Earth Objects]]. In  [[interferometric]] mode it functions as a [[VLBI]] station, part of the [[European VLBI Network]] (EVN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.ira.inaf.it/index_EN.htm|title=Home page|accessdate=2015-04-30|publisher=Medicina Radio Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern Cross Radio Telescope==
The '''Northern Cross Radio Telescope''' ('''Croce del Nord''' in Italian) is one of the largest transit radio telescopes in the world. Observations are focused around 408&amp;nbsp;MHz ([[Ultra high frequency|UHF band]]), corresponding to 73.5&amp;nbsp;cm wavelength. The older receivers of the telescope function with a 2.5&amp;nbsp;MHz wide frequency band, while the upgraded parts have a 16&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]].&lt;ref name=cross-debris&gt;{{cite news|journal = International Astronautical Congress, IAC 2014|title = Orbit determination of space debris using a bi-static radar configuration with a multiple-beam receiver|author = A.

* E/W (East-West) arm - Single reflector 560 m x 35 m (1536 [[Dipole antenna|dipoles]])
* N/S (North-South) arm - Array of 64 reflectors 640 m x 23.5 m (4096 dipoles)

The telescope can provide 22880 possible theoretical independent beams and has a [[field of view]] of 55.47 degrees (East-West) by 1.8 degrees (North-South).&lt;ref name=cross-debris /&gt; The resolution is around 4-5 [[Minute of arc|arcminutes]] in the North-South direction, and 4 arcminutes in the East-West direction. While less than the resolution of large [[optical telescopes]], the amount of radiation which can be gathered with the Northern Cross is much greater, proportional to the mirror surface of approximately 27400 square meters.  Northern Cross represents the largest UHF-band antenna in the [[Northern hemisphere]], with an [[Antenna aperture|aperture efficiency]] of 60%, making it second in the world, after the [[Arecibo radio telescope]].&lt;ref name=cross-debris /&gt; This allows the Northern Cross to identify and measure extremely faint sources, making the telescope is particularly suitable to [[Extragalactic astronomy|extragalactic researches]].&lt;ref name=description /&gt;

There are plans upgrade of the East-West arm telescope to a [[LOFAR]] SuperStation, due to the good performances of a cylindrical-parabolic antenna in the 100-700&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency range. Since LOFAR operates in the 120-240&amp;nbsp;MHz range, some of the sensors on the Northern Cross Radio Telescope, optimized for 408&amp;nbsp;MHz, will have to be replaced with broadband antennas. This installation will have an effective area much larger than any other remote LOFAR station. If extended to the whole 22000 square meters area of the East-West arm, this single element effective area of 20 standard remote LOFAR stations. The resulting system will provide signification improvement in observation sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.ira.inaf.it/Lofar_page8EN.htm|title=LOFAR SuperStation|accessdate=2015-05-02|publisher=Medicina Radio Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astron.nl/other/workshop/MCCT/MondayVirone.pdf|title=Electromagnetic development of broadband antenna feeding arrays for the Northern Cross Radio Telescope|accessdate=2015-04-30|publisher=IEIIT-CNR}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Square Kilometre Array pathfinder==
[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico - BEIC 6339200.jpg|thumb|Photo by [[Paolo Monti]]]]

The Cross is currently used as a pathfinder for the [[Square Kilometre Array]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ira.inaf.it/Medicinaweb/Nc/SKA%20ACTIVITIES.htm|title=SKA Activities|accessdate=2015-04-30|publisher=Medicina Radio Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is focused on studying the amplification and filtering of signals between the LNA (Low Noise Amplifier) output and the [[Analog-to-Digital Converter]] input for the SKA. The Medicina Radio Observatory is studying all problems related to "antenna array implementation" through a prototype installation called MAD (Medicina Array Demonstrator).&lt;ref name=technology&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.ira.inaf.it/tecnologie.html|title=Technology Developments|accessdate=2015-05-02|publisher=IRA-INAF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The observatory staff have also built new receiver demonstrators for the SKA called ''BEST'' (Basic Element for SKA Training), part of the [[European Union|EU]]-funded SKADS (SKA Design Studies) programme.&lt;ref name=best-x&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.med.ira.inaf.it/BEST/index_en.htm| title=BEST-X Project|accessdate=2015-05-22|publisher=IRA-INAF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project started in 2005 and finished in 2009. It involved the installation of the new receivers on some reflectors of the North-South section (and later East-West section) of the Northern Cross telescope, along with new analog [[fiber-optic]] and [[coaxial]] digital finks from the front-end receiver boxes to the back-ends.&lt;ref name=receivers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.ira.inaf.it/ricevitori.html|title=Receiver Design and Development|accessdate=2015-05-02|publisher=IRA-INAF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite proceedings|author = Montebugnoli, S. and Bianchi, G. and Monari, J. and Naldi, G. and Perini, F. and Schiaffino, M.|title=BEST: Basic Element for SKA Training|journal = Wide Field Astronomy &amp; Technology for the Square Kilometre Array|year = 2009|pages = 331-336|url = http://pos.sissa.it/archive/conferences/132/058/SKADS%202009_058.pdf|conference=SKADS Conference 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BEST project was divided in three parts:&lt;ref name=best-x /&gt;

[[Log periodic antenna]]s optimized for 120-240&amp;nbsp;MHz, along with 18 receivers were installed on part of the East-West arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.med.ira.inaf.it/BEST/BEST-3_en.htm| title=BEST-3lo|accessdate=2015-05-22|publisher=IRA-INAF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Space debris tracking==
There is an ongoing effort to use the 32 meter dish as a receiver for radar-based tracking system [[artificial satellites]] and [[space debris]] in [[Earth orbit]]. The system functions as a [[bistatic radar]], where an emitter located in a different location sends a signal, which bounces off objects in orbit and the echo is picked up by a receiver. The 32 meter dish acts as receiver, while usually the [[Yevpatoria RT-70 radio telescope|Yevpatoria 70 meter]] located in [[Crimea]], functions as a transmitter. The systems can either actively track debris to determine their orbit more precisely or utilize a technique called [[beam park]], where the transmitting and receiving antennas are kept fixed at a given position and the debris pass in and out of the observed area. The measurements obtain through such a system can be used to determine object [[radar cross-section]], time of peak occurrence, [[polarization (antenna)|polarization]] ratio, bistatic [[doppler shift]] and target rotation. In one of the carried-out tests, Yevpatoria-Medicina system was able to detect an object with an estimated radar cross section of 0.0002 square meter, which was created by the [[2009 satellite collision|Iridium 33 and Kosmos-2251 satellite collision]]. The system can also function as a [[multistatic radar]] using the 32 meter receivers at Medicina, the [[Noto Radio Observatory]] in Italy and the [[Ventspils Starptautiskais Radioastronomijas Centrs]] in [[Latvia]].&lt;ref name=debris&gt;{{cite news |

The Northern Cross radio telescope has also been part of space debris tracking studies, utilized as a multiple-beam receiver for a bistatic radar system. The first tested configuration is a quasi-monostatic radar system, with a 3 m dish as transmitter, located in [[Bagnara]] - 20&amp;nbsp;km from the receiver. The second configuration was a simulation of a true bistatic radar system with 7 m dish as transmitter located at the site of the [[Sardinia Radio Telescope]] (SRT). The system has a maximum field-of-view of about 100 square degrees and collecting area of approximately 27400 square meter and is capable of providing up to 22880 beams, each 4 by 4 arcminutes wide. Tracking the sequence of beams that are illuminated, makes possible for the system to track with higher level of detail, with respect to the single-beam systems, the [[ground track]] of a transiting object.&lt;ref name=cross-debris /&gt; The Northern Cross radio telescope in a bistatic radar configuration is also part of the Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) segment of the [[ESA]] [[Space Situational Awareness Programme]] (SSA).&lt;ref name=sst-radars&gt;{{cite web|url = https://sst.ssa.esa.int/cwbi/general/radar_sens.xhtml|title=Europe’s Radar Space Surveillance and Tracking Sensors|access-date=2015-05-04|publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources of the Republic of Armenia''' ({{lang-hy|ՀՀ Էներգետիկ ենթակառուցվածքների և բնական պաշարների նախարարություն}}) is the ministry responsible for the management of the energy systems, and control of the exploitation of natural resources in Armenia. It elaborates and implements the policies of the Republic of Armenia Government in the energy sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gov.am/en/structure/7/ |title=Government - Structure - The Government of the Republic of Armenia |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=27 December 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.minenergy.am/page/375 |title= Historical overview - Ministry - www.minenergy.am|date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=27 December 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its history can be traced to the time that Armenia was still in the Soviet Union. Since that time, many ministers have changed, as well the official name of the ministry, while maintaining the word 'energy' in its name. As of 2016, it is one of the 18 ministries in Armenia, and plays an important role in regulating the laws and policies regarding the energy and natural resource spheres.

== History ==
[[File:Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources of the Republic of Armenia.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Building of Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources]]
The Armenian energy system has a 100-year history, during which time the ArmEnergo department played an important role. ArmEnergo was formed in November 1936 with the decision of the [[Soviet Union]] with the aim of managing and controlling the exploitation and development of electric stations and networks. The two hydropower plants of Yerevan, the [[Gyumri HPP]], [[Dzora HPP]] and other technical services were part of ArmEnergo. Later on ArmEnergo became the official body eligible to control the whole energy system of Armenia.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Armenian economic reforms, and dawn of [[Armenian energy crisis of 1990s|an energy crisis]] required new control mechanisms. In order to overcome this, in 1992 the '''Ministry of Energy and Fuel of the Republic of Armenia''' was created. The ministry was renamed as the '''Ministry of Energy of The Republic of Armenia''' on August 4, 1995 by a decision of the Armenian government. Once more, the ministry was renamed as '''Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources of The Republic of Armenia''' by a decree of the Armenian president on 18 April 2008, which was renamed as the '''Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources of The Republic of Armenia''' on September 30, 2016. Today, the main aim of the ministry is to develop and maintain the governance policy of the Republic of Armenia in the sphere of energy infrastructures and natural resources.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

== Natural resources ==
The mining sector is a very important part or Armenia’s national economy. Ore concentrates and metals are the main goods exported from Armenia at about half of all exported goods. About 670 mines are officially registered, of which more than half (around 400 mines) are exploited.
 
The ministry reports that there is an abundance of iron, copper, molybdenum, lead, zinc, gold, silver, antimony, aluminum, and also other types of minerals and metals in the Republic of Armenia. Metal mineral mines include 7 copper-molybdenum mines, 4 copper mines, 14 gold and gold-polymetallic mines, 2 polymetallic mine, 2 iron ore mines, and 1 aluminum mine.

Also, as a result of volcanic processes, mountainous rocks were formed. Notable ones are light rocks (tufa, perlite, pumice-stone, zeolite, scoria). In addition, different types of basalts, granites, nephelite syenite, and marble make up a large percent of resources in Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minenergy.am/en/page/472|title=General Information - Mining Resources - www.minenergy.am|last=|first=|date=|website=www.minenergy.am|publisher=Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources of The Republic of Armenia|access-date=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy sources ==
{{main article|Energy in Armenia}}
While being surrounded by countries that have significant hydrocarbon reserves, Armenia does not have enough fossil fuels and coal to be able to use them for producing energy. As such, Armenia is totally dependent on fuel that is imported from abroad as a fuel source for transportation, generating energy, and producing heat. Research shows that Armenia has some fossil fuel reserves which are mostly located near Gyumri and Spitak, but they are located so deep that it is not economically feasible to extract them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Overview of Armenia|url=http://www.geni.org/globalenergy/library/national_energy_grid/armenia/EnergyOverviewofArmenia.shtml|website=www.geni.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, during the energy crisis, Armenia succeeded in constructing a large energy system. However, compared with 1988, when the energy generated capacity was more than 3.5 gigawatts, in 2010 it was just 1.2 gigawatts, which can be explained by the Armenian Government's decision to close some of the thermal power plants and one of the 2 reactors of the Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant. As a result, Armenia started utilizing renewable energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2013/07/armenia-prepares-renewable-roadmap-amid-energy-crisis.html|title=Armenia Prepares Renewable Roadmap Amid Energy Crisis|last=Gharabegian|first=Areg|date=3 July 2013|website=www.renewableenergyworld.com|publisher=RenewableEnergyWorld.com|access-date=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy security ==
The concept of [[Energy security]] of [[Armenia]] is aimed at ensuring the [[energy security]] of [[Armenia]] in conformity with the provisions of the [[National Security Strategy (Armenia)|National Security Strategy]] of [[Armenia]]. [[Energy security]] is a system of [[political]], [[economic]], [[legal]], [[organizational]], [[methodological]], and other activities that provide affordable [[prices]] to meet the daily needs of high-quality and [[Reliability engineering|reliable]] [[power supply]], as well as in emergency situations, and during [[war]].

[[Armenia]] has adopted a sustainable [[development policy]] which implies the development of the [[energy sector]] as the most important area. This sector's aim is to ensure the kind of progress that will create preconditions for the harmonization and balance of [[environmental issues]] for sustainable development of the next generation, while reducing [[energy loss]]. Because of Armenia's limited [[hydrocarbon]] resources, [[energy security]] has become imperative for the presence of [[energy resources]], including the balance of [[renewable energy sources]] ([[renewable energy]]), and the extensive use of full inclusion.

Since there are no [[fossil fuel]] resources in Armenia, the function of Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources of [[Armenia]] and natural in the framework of the energy security's concept is to increase [[energy conservation|energy efficiency]] in the [[economy]], develop [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]], and efficiently use [[renewable energy]] resources.

The adoption of the concept of [[energy security]] is due to:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minenergy.am/page/492|title=Հայեցակարգեր - Ծրագրեր - www.minenergy.am|last=|first=|date=|website=www.minenergy.am|publisher=Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources of The Republic of Armenia|language=Armenian|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;(August 2005).

# The [[regional]] and the world's political and [[socio-economic]] rapid development, [[global recession|global economic crisis]], as well as [[Armenia's energy independence]], security of emergency, and [[war]].
# Proper engagement of Armenia in regional programs that are implemented in the region by the [[European Union]], [[Russia]], the [[United States]] and other [[international organizations]].
# The importance of creating a long-term strategic reserve of [[fuel]] and [[energy resources]].

== Strategic plans ==
Strategic plans of the ministry are based on a three-level diversification policy:
# Generation of energy ([[hydropower plant|HPPs]], [[nuclear power plant|NPPs]], [[thermal power plant|TPPs]], and other power plants)
# [[Energy supply]] (fuel supply), such as [[natural gas]], [[oil]] and other fuels
# [[Fuel]] and [[energy]] [[transportation]]: [[natural gas]] delivery by pipelines, oil product delivery and other related transportation

The three-level diversification policy's aim is to provide a sufficient level of [[energy security]], to have [[electricity]] and [[gas]] consumption reserves in both emergency and force majeure situations. In the framework of this policy there are programs to neutralize internal and external threats, for life-time extension of the [[Armenian Nuclear Power Plant]], and for construction of new cost-effective electricity generating facilities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Galstyan, Areg (2014).

== Achievements of the ministry ==
===Construction of new generating capacities===
* ''[[Yerevan Combined Cycle Gas Power Plant]]'': This project was completed in 2013. Through this project, Iranian and Armenian economic efficiency increased.
* ''Hrazdan N5 [[Combined Cycle Gas Turbine]]'', with an installed capacity of 440 MW: This project was accomplished in December, 2013, which was implemented within the framework of agreement between the [[Government of Armenia]] and [[Gazprom]] OJSC.

===Regional integration===
* Armenia and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] signed the ''Parallel Operation Agreement'', in which [[Armenia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] agree to provide power to each other during emergency situations.
* Armenia and Georgia accepted the investigation of interconnection transmission lines with establishment of a substation with a back-to-back converter at an overall power of 1,050 MW, and marked Amendment N2 to the New Transmission Line Construction Agreement on April 16, 2014.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

== Investment Projects ==
The Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources of Armenia has continuous goals to contribute to the development of the energy sector in the Republic of Armenia. Thus, every year, it starts to accomplish new projects in the field of renewable energy in conjunction with various international companies and investors.

[[File:Glencoul Thrust Fault Zone in Scotland 2014.jpg|thumb|right|The Glencoul Thrust, part of the Moine Thrust Belt, dipping downwards from left to right, where Precambrian [[Lewisian complex|Lewisian gneiss]] has been pushed along the thrust fault and now lies above younger well-bedded Cambrian quartzite, which itself lies unconformably above Lewisian gneiss]]
The '''Moine Thrust Belt''' or '''Moine Thrust Zone''' is a linear [[tectonics|tectonic]] feature in the [[Scottish Highlands]] which runs from [[Loch Eriboll]] on the north coast {{convert|190|km}} south-west to the  Sleat peninsula  on the [[Isle of Skye]]. The thrust belt consists of a series of [[thrust fault]]s that branch off the Moine Thrust itself. [[Topography|Topographically]], the belt marks a change from rugged, terraced mountains with steep sides sculptured from weathered [[igneous rock|igneous]], [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] rocks in the west to an extensive landscape of rolling hills over a metamorphic rock base to the east. Mountains within the belt display complexly folded and faulted layers and the width of the main part of the zone varies up to {{convert|10|km}}, although it is significantly wider on Skye.

== Discovery ==
The presence of metamorphic [[gneiss]]es and [[schist]]s lying apparently stratigraphically above sedimentary rocks of lower [[Paleozoic]] age in the Northwest Highlands had been known since the early 19th century, convincing [[Roderick Murchison]] that the change was a purely metamorphic effect and that the upper gneiss was younger than the sediments beneath. Initially he was supported in this interpretation by [[Archibald Geikie]] and [[James Nicol]]. After further fieldwork, Nicol changed his mind and advocated instead that the contact at the base of the upper gneisses was tectonic, starting what was known as the [[Knockan Crag National Nature Reserve#Highlands Controversy|Highlands Controversy]]. A tectonic interpretation was supported by, amongst others, [[Charles Lapworth]] who had corresponded with [[Albert Heim]] on similar structures in the Alps. In 1883 and 1884 the [[British Geological Survey|survey]] geologists [[Ben Peach]] and [[John Horne]] were sent into the area by the survey's director Archibald Geikie to carry out detailed mapping. The results of the mapping proved conclusively to Peach and Horne that the contact was tectonic and they were eventually able to persuade Geikie when he visited them briefly in the field in October 1884. In November that year Peach and Horne's preliminary results were published and Geikie published a paper in the same issue of [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] in which he coined the term "thrust-plane" for these low-angle faults, although the term was probably already in use before then.&lt;ref name="White_2010"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Continental Tectonics and Mountain Building: The Legacy of Peach and Horne|last=White S.H. |year=2010 |isbn=9781862393004 |editor-last=Law R.D. |series=Geological Society, London, Special Publications |volume=335 |publication-date=2010 |pages=505–542 |chapter=Mylonites: lessons from Eriboll |editor-last2=Butler R.W.H. |editor-last3=Holdsworth R.E. |editor-last4=Krabbendam M. |editor-last5=Strachan R.A. |chapter-url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/335/1/505#ref-130}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1888 the term "Moine Thrust" was being used for the tectonic break at the base of Moine schists (what is now called the [[Moine Supergroup]]). The recognition of the Moine Thrust Belt in the early 1880s was a milestone in the history of [[geology]] as it was one of the first thrust belts discovered and where the importance of large scale horizontal rather than vertical movements became apparent. Detailed mapping of the Moine Thrust Belt by the survey continued for another two decades, culminating in the classic survey memoir ''The Geological Structure of the Northwest Highlands of Scotland'', published in 1907.&lt;ref name="1907_Memoir"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://pubs.bgs.ac.uk/publications.html?pubID=B01955 |title=The geological structure of the North-West Highlands of Scotland (with petrological chapters and notes by JJH Teall) |last= Peach B. N., Horne J., Gunn W., Clough C. T., Hinxman L. &amp; Teall J.J.H. |publisher=British Geological Survey |year=1907 |series=Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Great Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Caledonian structure==
{{main|Caledonian Orogeny}}
The Moine Thrust Belt was formed during the late stages of the Caledonian Orogeny as part of the [[continental collision|collision]] between [[Laurentia]] and [[Baltica]]. It is the most westerly Caledonian structure in Scotland apart from the [[Outer Isles Fault]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]], which is developed within the [[Hebridean Terrane]]. The Moine Thrust Belt defines the boundary between the Hebridean Terrane to its northwest and the [[Northern Highlands Terrane]] to its southeast.&lt;ref&gt;British Geological Survey 1996 Tectonic map of Britain, Ireland &amp; adjacent areas, Pharoah et al&lt;/ref&gt; The thrust carried metamorphic material over 200&amp;nbsp;km across Scotland entirely masking the geology of the previous terrane. However, small windows, such as the [[Assynt]] window and the Glen Achall imbricated thrust system, allow [[geologists]] to estimate what the geology of Scotland was like before the Caledonian Orogeny.

The relationship between the Moine Thrust Belt and other Scandian age structures in Scandinavia and East Greenland remains unclear, due to uncertainties associated with the [[Great Glen Fault]] zone. This major sinistral (left-lateral) [[Fault (geology)#Strike-slip faults|strike-slip fault]] was also active during the late stages of the orogeny, but continued to move during the early Devonian and appears to truncate the southern end of the thrust belt. The total late Caledonian displacement on the Great Glen Fault is poorly constrained, making reconstruction of the southern part of the orogenic belt difficult.&lt;ref name="JNCC_2009"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-2746 |title=Lewisian, Torridonian and Moine Rocks of Scotland |last=Mendum, J.R., Barber A.J., Butler R.W.H., Flinn D., Goodenough K.M., Krabbendam M., Park R.G &amp; Stewart A.D. |year=2008 |series=Geological Conservation Review, '''34''' |publisher= Joint Nature Conservation Committee |pages=3–20 |isbn=978 1 86107 566 6  |access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Involved rock units ==
The stratigraphic sequence of the footwall of the Moine Thrust is the full sequence characteristic of the Hebridean Terrane.

=== Lewisian complex ===
The [[Lewisian complex]] consists of mainly granitic gneisses that are of [[Archean|Archaean]] and [[Paleoproterozoic]] age. They form the basement to both the [[Torridonian|Torridonian Supergroup]] and the Moine Supergroup of the Northern Highlands Terrane, in the hanging wall of the Moine Thrust.

=== Torridonian ===
The Torridonian Supergroup is of Neoproterozoic age and consists mainly of sandstone with a maximum preserved thickness of over 8 km. It is divided into three groups, the Stoer, Sleat and Torridon groups. The unconformity at the base of this unit is highly irregular, showing that it was deposited on an eroded land surface.

=== Lower Palaeozoic ===
The Cambrian to lower Ordovician rocks consist of two groups, the [[Ardvreck Group]] and the [[Durness Group]]. The Ardvreck Group lies above an angular unconformity over various parts of the Torridon Group and locally over the Lewisian. It is a sequence of mainly quartz arenites. The lowermost part of the Eriboll Formation, the Basal Quartzite Member, is often pebbly at its base. The overlying Pipe Rock Member is a distinctive quartz arenite with many white weathering ''[[skolithos]]'' [[trace fossil]]s that act as strain markers in areas of more ductile deformation. The uppermost two parts of the Ardvreck Group form the An t-Sron Formation, with the dolomitic Fucoid Beds Member being overlain by the quartz arenites of the Salterella Grit Member. The succeeding Durness Group consists mainly of dolostones, with some limestone and chert.

The distinctive character of this sequence enabled detailed mapping, even in areas of relatively poor exposure and allowed sections repeated by thrusting to be recognised.

=== Moine Supergroup ===
The Moine Supergroup, like the Torridonian, is of Neoproterozoic age and possibly a lateral equivalent of that unit. Near the Moine Thrust all of the Moine rocks form part of the Morar Group, which forms the lowest [[tectonostratigraphy|tectonostratigraphic]] unit of the Moine.

== Individual thrusts ==
[[File:The Moine Thrust at Knockan Crag - geograph.org.uk - 916017.jpg|thumb|The Moine Thrust at [[Knockan Crag]], in the central section of the thrust belt. Neoproterozoic Moine schists are thrust over Cambrian–Ordovician [[Durness Group]] [[dolostone]]s]] 
In addition to the Sole Thrust at the base of the northern section of the structure and the Moine Thrust at the top of the belt, many other thrust faults are developed, some of which are large enough to be named and mapped more regionally. The thrust sheet carried by each thrust is named after the thrust beneath it, although the term "[[nappe]]" is also used.

=== Moine Thrust ===
The Moine Thrust in the strict sense is the uppermost thrust in the belt and the one that carries the most displacement. In all cases it carries rocks of the Moine Supergroup over rocks of the Hebridean Terrane. Unlike the other thrusts, there is a broad zone (up to 600 m in thickness) of the Moine in the hanging-wall that is intensely deformed into mylonite, indicating that it originated at a significantly deeper crustal level. Total displacement on this one structure has been estimated as several 10s of kilometres based on the change in crustal level and the thickness of mylonites developed.&lt;ref name="Holdsworth_etal_2007"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/G_Alsop/publication/249551773_Tectonic_stratigraphy_and_structural_continuity_of_the_northernmost_Moine_Thrust_Zone_and_Moine_Nappe_Scottish_Caledonides/links/0f317536f6c00c25ad000000/Tectonic-stratigraphy-and-structural-continuity-of-the-northernmost-Moine-Thrust-Zone-and-Moine-Nappe-Scottish-Caledonides.pdf |title=Tectonic stratigraphy and structural continuity of the northernmost Moine Thrust Zone and Moine Nappe, Scottish Caledonides  |last=Holdsworth R.E. |last2=Alsop G.I. |last3=Strachan R.A. |work=Deformation of the Continental Crust: The Legacy of Mike Coward |publisher=Geological Society |year=2007 |isbn=9781862392151 |editor-last=Ries A.C. |series=Special Publications |volume=272 |publication-place=London |page=121–142 |doi=10.1144/GSL.SP.2007.272.01.08 |editor-last2=Butler R.W.H. |editor-last3=Graham R.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its central section, south of the Assynt Window, it becomes the sole thrust structure, before the Kinlochewe Thrust branches off to the south.

=== Sole Thrust ===
This thrust forms the base of the belt from Eriboll to the southern end of the Assynt Window where it merges with the Moine Thrust itself. It is thought to be the youngest formed thrust structure in the belt, which is consistent with a foreland propagating thrust sequence. Along strike the footwall of the Sole Thrust changes from Lewisian in the south to Cambrian in the north.

=== Arnaboll Thrust ===
In the Eriboll section this thrust carries Lewisian gneiss over the Pipe Rock. Its outcrop is complicated by the effects of later thrusting that both folds and offsets the Arnaboll Thrust. The exposures on the flank of Ben Arnaboll have particular importance as it was here that Lapworth first described the highly deformed rock type [[mylonite]] and also where Geikie coined the term "thrust plane".&lt;ref name="Wibberley_&amp;_Butler_2010"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/335/1/321 |title=Structure and internal deformation of the Arnaboll Thrust Sheet, NW Scotland: implications for strain localization in thrust belts |last=Wibberley C.A.J. |last2=Butler R.W.H. |work=Continental Tectonics and Mountain Building: The Legacy of Peach and Horne |publisher=Geological Society |year=2010 |isbn=9781862393004 |editor-last=Law R.D. |series=Special Publications |volume=335 |location=London |pages=321–333 |editor-last2=Butler R.W.H. |editor-last3=Holdsworth R.E. |editor-last4=Krabbendam M. |editor-last5=Strachan R.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ben More Thrust ===
The Ben More Thrust is the largest and most continuous of the thrust faults developed between the Moine and Sole Thrusts within the Assynt Window.

=== Glencoul Thrust ===
This thrust is developed within the lower part of the belt in the Assynt Window.

=== Kinlochewe Thrust ===
The Kinlochewe Thrust branches off the Moine Thrust's central section and runs southwards past [[Kinlochewe]] to the Achnashellach Culmination, where it is truncated by the SW–NE trending Strathcarron Fault. It may originally have been continuous with the Kishorn Thrust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/272/1/103.short |title=Structural evolution of the Achnashellach Culmination, southern Moine Thrust Belt: testing the duplex model |last=Butler R.W.H. |last2=Matthews S.J. |last3=Morgan R.K. |work=Deformation of the Continental Crust: The Legacy of Mike Coward |year=2007 |isbn=9781862392151 |editor-last=Ries A.C.  |series=Special Publications Geological Society, London |volume=272 |page = 103–120|publication-date= |doi=10.1144/GSL.SP.2007.272.01.07 |editor-last2=Butler R.W.H. |editor-last3=Graham R.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kishorn Thrust ===
The Kishorn Thrust extends from the Achnashellach Culmination, just north of [[Loch Carron]], where it is truncated by the Strathcarron Fault. It continues southwestwards to [[Loch Kishorn]], becoming the basal thrust. On the [[Isle of Skye]], the Kishorn Thrust also marks the base of the Moine Thrust Belt bringing mainly Torridonian sandstones over foreland Cambrian-Ordovician limestones and quartzites. Locally on the [[Sleat peninsula]] the Kishorn thrust sheet is eroded to form the Ord window in which the foreland rocks once more appear.

=== Tarskavaig Thrust ===
At the southwestern end of the Sleat peninsula, the Tarskavaig Thrust carries Moine Supergroup metasediments over the Torridonian of the underlying Kishorn thrust sheet.&lt;ref name="Law_&amp;_Potts_1987"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Law R.D. |last2=Potts G.J. |year=1987 |title=The Tarskavaig  Nappe  of  Skye, northwest  Scotland:  a re-examination  of  the  fabrics  and  their  kinematic  significance |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Law2/publication/231849014_The_Tarskavaig_Nappe_of_Skye_northwest_Scotland_a_re-examination_of_the_fabrics_and_their_kinematic_significance/links/543c194a0cf204cab1db8593.pdf |journal=Geological Magazine |volume=124 |issue=3 |pages=231–248 |doi=10.1017/S0016756800016265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Northward continuation ==
When the MOIST (Moine and Outer Isles Seismic Traverse) deep seismic profile was acquired north of the Scottish mainland by the [[BIRPS]] group in 1981 a series of east-dipping fault zones were imaged, two of which were interpreted as potential continuations of the Moine Thrust. The presence of [[graben#Half-graben|half graben]] basin in the hanging walls of these faults was interpreted to represent Devonian and Mesozoic extensional reactivation of the Caledonian thrust structures. Further deep profiles acquired in the same area, the DRUM and GRID lines confirmed these features. Onshore on [[Shetland Isles|Shetland]] the Wester Keolka Shear was proposed to represent the Moine Thrust,&lt;ref name="McBride&amp;England_1994"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McBride J.H. |last2=England R.W. |year=1994 |title=Deep seismic reflection structure of the Caledonian orogenic front west of Shetland |url=http://jgs.lyellcollection.org/content/151/1/9.short |journal=Journal of the Geological Society |volume=151 |issue=1 |pages=9–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; although more recent [[radiometric dating]] results suggest that this is unlikely to be the case.&lt;ref name="Walker_etal_2016"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Walker S. |last2=Thirwall M.F. |last3=Strachan R.A. |last4=Bird A.F. |title=Evidence from Rb–Sr mineral ages for multiple orogenic events  in the Caledonides of Shetland, Scotland |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Steph_Walker/publication/288021029_Evidence_from_Rb-Sr_mineral_ages_for_multiple_orogenic_events_in_the_Caledonides_of_Shetland_Scotland/links/568a46bc08ae051f9afa3bf2.pdf |journal=Journal of the Geological Society |volume=173 |issue=3 |year = 2016 |pages=489–503 |doi=10.1144/jgs2015-034}}&lt;/ref&gt; The link between the structures imaged offshore and those onshore remains unclear.

== Southwestward continuation ==
Southwest of Skye the course of the Moine Thrust Belt becomes uncertain. It is assumed that it must pass to the southeast of the mainly Lewisian islands of [[Coll]] and [[Tiree]]. It is often shown passing through the [[Sound of Iona]] west of [[Mull]], although no thrusts are actually exposed. It is presumed to be truncated by the Great Glen Fault zone somewhere southwest of Mull.

== Timing ==
Movement on the Moine Thrust Belt has been dated partly on its relationship with a series of igneous intrusions in the Assynt Window and partly from the results of [[radiometric dating]] of deformed rocks from the footwall or hanging-wall of the thrusts. The intrusions near [[Loch Borralan]] and [[Loch Ailsh]] have similar chemistry, both being forms of [[syenite]], and have been dated at 430±4 Ma and 430.6±0.3 Ma respectively suggesting that they were intruded at about the same time. The Loch Ailsh intrusion outcrops within the Ben More thrust sheet and predates movement on that structure. The Loch Borralan intrusion lies beneath the Ben More Thrust. Locally the intrusion has been said to cut across the Ben More Thrust, but a lack of the metamorphic effects found elsewhere along the margin of the intrusion suggest that this contact is tectonic rather than intrusive. In the upper part of the Borralan intrusion, there is evidence of deformation of the syenite while it was still hot, suggesting that thrusting started soon after it was intruded.&lt;ref name="Searle_etal_2010"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Continental Tectonics and Mountain Building: The Legacy of Peach and Horne |last=Searle M.P. |last2=Law R.D. |last3=Dewey J.F. |last4=Streule M.J. |year=2010 |isbn=9781862393004 |editor-last=Law R.D. |series=Geological Society, London, Special Publications |volume=335 |chapter=Relationships between the Loch Ailsh and Borralan alkaline intrusions and thrusting in the Moine Thrust zone, southern Assynt culmination, NW Scotland |editor-last2=Butler R.W.H. |editor-last3=Holdsworth R.E. |editor-last4=Krabbendam M. |editor-link5=Strachan R.A. |chapter-url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/335/1/383|page = 383–404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1031">The '''Pincoy''' is a  male "water spirit" of the seas, belonging to the [[Chilote mythology]] of [[Chiloé]], [[Chile]]. 

It looks equivalent to a [[merman]] creature, his body would be like a large [[South American sea lion|sea lion]], colour bright golden, with handsome and manly human face and long golden hair, being magically attractive to the women. He is the son of [[Millalobo]] (mythical king of the seas of Chiloé) and the human [[Huenchula]]; his sisters, are the [[Sirena chilota]] and the [[Pincoya]] (which also is his wife). With his sisters he carries the dead from the sea unto the [[Caleuche]]. In addition, he is responsible of singing a beautiful and strange song, so that the Pincoya start her magical dance, for fertility of the sea.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2387">In strong-field [[laser physics]], '''ponderomotive energy''' is the cycle-averaged quiver energy of a free electron in an [[electromagnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;''Highly Excited Atoms''. By J. P. Connerade. p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Equation ==
The ponderomotive energy is given by
:&lt;math&gt;U_p = {e^2 E_a^2 \over 4m \omega_0^2}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron charge]], &lt;math&gt;E_a&lt;/math&gt; is the linearly [[Polarization (waves)|polarised]] electric field amplitude, &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; is the laser [[carrier frequency]] and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron mass]].

In terms of the laser [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]] &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, using &lt;math&gt;I=c\epsilon_0 E_a^2/2&lt;/math&gt;, it reads less simply:
:&lt;math&gt;U_p={e^2 I \over 2 c \epsilon_0 m \omega_0^2}={2e^2 \over c \epsilon_0 m} \times {I \over 4\omega_0^2}&lt;/math&gt;,

where  &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the vacuum permittivity.

===Atomic units===
In [[atomic units]], &lt;math&gt;e=m=1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0=1/4\pi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha c=1&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\alpha \approx 1/137&lt;/math&gt;. If one uses the [[Atomic units|atomic unit of electric field]],&lt;ref&gt;CODATA Value: [http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?auefld atomic unit of electric field] &lt;/ref&gt; then the ponderomotive energy is just
:&lt;math&gt;U_p = \frac{E_a^2}{4\omega_0^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivation==
The formula for the ponderomotive energy can be easily derived. A free particle of charge
&lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; interacts with an electric field &lt;math&gt;E \, \exp(-i\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;. The force on the charged particle is 
:&lt;math&gt;F = qE \, \exp(-i\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;. 

The acceleration of the particle is 
:&lt;math&gt;a_{m} = {F \over m} = {q E \over m} \exp(-i\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;. 

Because the electron executes harmonic motion, the particle's position is 
:&lt;math&gt;x = {-a \over \omega^2}= -\frac{qE}{m\omega^2} \, \exp(-i\omega t) = -\frac{q}{m\omega^2} \sqrt{\frac{2I_0}{c\epsilon_0}} \, \exp(-i\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;. 

For a particle experiencing harmonic motion, the time-averaged energy is 
:&lt;math&gt;U = \textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}m\omega^2 \langle x^2\rangle = {q^2 E^2 \over 4 m \omega^2}&lt;/math&gt;. 

In laser physics, this is called the ponderomotive energy &lt;math&gt;U_p&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Power Tower''' is the first high-rise office tower to attempt to meet the strict [[Passive House]] energy efficiency building standard.  It was built to house the corporate headquarters of the Austrian utility company [[Energie AG]] in [[Linz]], Austria.

In accordance with the Passive House standard the building has no connection to the local [[district heating]] system, and requires no fossil fuel inputs to maintain a comfortable interior climate, resulting in much lower carbon dioxide emissions than comparable buildings.  

== History ==
In 2004 [[Energie AG]] decided to replace its corporate headquarters, built in the 1930s, with a much more efficient building.  After an architectural competition the Zürich firm Weber/Hofer was chosen to lead the design effort.  In the spring of 2006 construction began on the 3,750 m^2 lot.  The site houses a parking garage, a two story building, and the 19-story office tower.  Construction was completed in the late summer of 2008, and the building now provides offices for 600 employees of 13 different companies.

== Building Energy Systems ==
The Power Tower minimizes its external energy consumption via several integrated systems. 

=== Advanced Building Envelope ===
The building envelope was specially engineered to allow maximum [[daylighting]] while minimizing [[solar gain]], which would normally be excessive and require a great deal of active cooling, given that two thirds of the facade is composed of glazing. 

=== Geothermal Heating and Cooling ===
Beneath the building, 46 geothermal wells, each 150 m deep were drilled prior to construction.

'''''Saraca asoca''''' (the '''ashoka tree'''; lit., "sorrow-less") is a plant belonging to the [[Caesalpinioideae]] subfamily of the [[Fabaceae|legume]] family. It is an important tree in the cultural traditions of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and adjacent areas. It is sometimes incorrectly known as ''[[Saraca indica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Zuijderhoudt, G.F.P. |year=1968 |title=A revision of the genus ''Saraca'' L. — (Legum. Caes.) |journal=Blumea |volume=15 |pages=413–425 |url=http://www.repository.naturalis.nl/document/565670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:Sita-Ashok (Saraca asoca) leaves &amp; flowers in Kolkata W IMG 4175.jpg|thumb| Leaves and flowers in [[Kolkata]], [[West Bengal]], India]]
The ashoka is a [[rain-forest]] tree. Its original distribution was in the central areas of the [[Deccan plateau]], as well as the middle section of the [[Western Ghats]] in the western coastal zone of the Indian subcontinent.

The ashoka is prized for its beautiful foliage and fragrant [[flower]]s. It is a handsome, small, erect [[evergreen]] tree, with deep green leaves growing in dense clusters.

Its flowering season is around February to April. The ashoka flowers come in heavy, lush bunches. They are bright orange-yellow in color, turning red before wilting.

Biologically, some of the flower's characteristics are very dry and abundant. This means that the flower is coated with a chemical on the outside.

As a wild tree, the ashoka is a [[vulnerable species]]. It is becoming rarer in its natural habitat, but isolated wild ashoka trees are still to be found in the foothills of the central and eastern [[Himalayas]], in scattered locations of the northern plains of India as well as on the west coast of the subcontinent near [[Mumbai]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

There are a few varieties of the ashoka tree. One variety is larger and highly spreading. The columnar varieties are common in cultivation.

==Mythology and tradition==
[[Image:CunninghamBharhut.jpg|thumb|left|Yakshi under a stylized ashoka tree. Railing figure at [[Bharhut]] Stupa, 2nd century BC, India]]
[[File:Birth of Buddha at Lumbini.jpg|thumb|left|Queen Māyā giving birth to the Buddha]]
The ashoka tree is considered sacred throughout the Indian subcontinent, especially in [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. This tree has many [[Folklore of India|folklorical]], religious and literary associations in the region. Highly valued as well for its handsome appearance and the color and abundance of its [[flower]]s, the ashoka tree is often found in royal palace compounds and gardens as well as close to temples throughout India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tamilnadu.com/herbs/ashoka.html |title=Herbs - Ashoka |publisher=Tamilnadu.com |date=25 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814044945/http://tamilnadu.com/herbs/ashoka.html |archivedate=August 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed [[Shakyamuni Buddha]] was born under an ashoka tree in [[Lumbini Garden]].

The ashoka tree is closely associated with the [[yakshi]] mythological beings. One of the recurring elements in [[Indian art]], often found at gates of Buddhist and Hindu temples, is the sculpture of a yakshini with her foot on the trunk and her hands holding the branch of a flowering ashoka tree. As an artistic element, often the tree and the yakshi are subject to heavy [[Indian art|stylization]]. Some authors hold that the young girl at the foot of this tree is based on an ancient [[tree deity]] related to [[fertility]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Zimmer, ''Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization.'' (1946)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Yakshis under the ashoka tree were also important in early Buddhist monuments as a decorative element and are found in many ancient Buddhist archaeological sites. With the passing of the centuries the yakshi under the ashoka tree became a standard decorative element of Hindu [[Sculpture in India|Indian sculpture]] and was integrated into [[Architecture of India|Indian temple architecture]] as [[salabhanjika]], because there is often a confusion between the ashoka tree and the [[Shorea robusta|sal]] tree (''Shorea robusta'') in the ancient literature of the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref&gt;Buddhistische Bilderwelt: Hans Wolfgang Schumann, ''Ein ikonographisches Handbuch des Mahayana- und Tantrayana-Buddhismus.'' Eugen Diederichs Verlag. Cologne. {{ISBN|978-3-424-00897-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ASHOKa.jpg|thumb|ashoka blossom]]

In [[Hinduism]] the ashoka is considered a sacred tree. Not counting a multitude of local traditions connected to it, the ashoka tree is worshipped in [[Chaitra]],&lt;ref name=her&gt;[http://www.herbsnspicesinfo.com/medicinal-herbs/ashoka-tree.aspx Ashoka Tree]&lt;/ref&gt; a month of the [[Hindu calendar]].&lt;ref name=her/&gt; It is also associated with [[Kamadeva]], the Hindu god of love, who included an ashoka blossom among the five flowers in his quiver, where ashoka represent seductive hypnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Flowering Trees and Shrubs in India, Sixth Edition |last=Cowen |first=D. V. |year=1984 |publisher=THACKER and Co. Ltd. |location=[[Bombay]] |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the ashoka tree is often mentioned in classical [[Sanskrit literature|Indian religious and amorous poetry]], having at least 16 different names in [[Sanskrit]] referring to the tree or its flowers.&lt;ref&gt;Eckard Schleberger, ''Die indische Götterwelt. Gestalt, Ausdruck und Sinnbild'' Eugen Diederich Verlag. Cologne. {{ISBN|3-424-00898-2}}, {{ISBN|978-3-424-00898-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Mahākāvya'', or [[Indian epic poetry]], the ashoka tree is mentioned in the ''[[Ramayana]]'' in reference to the ''[[Ashoka Vatika]]'' (garden of ashoka trees) where [[Hanuman]] first meets [[Sita]].

==Other trees called 'ashoka tree' ==
[[File:Polyalthia longifolia.jpg|thumb|right|False ashoka]]
A popular tree known as "false ashoka tree" or even as "ashoka tree", ''[[Polyalthia longifolia]]'', is cultivated to resemble the growth pattern of erect ''pillar-like'' Mediterranean [[Cupressus sempervirens|cypress]] trees. It is a popular park and garden plant, much used in landscaping on the Indian subcontinent, known also as ''Devadaar'' or ''Debdaru''. This tree can easily be distinguished by its compound leaves and very different flowers.  Ashoka flowers are red (initially orange in color) while False Ashoka flowers are apple green in color.  Ashoka fruits look like broad beans containing multiple seeds while false ashoka fruits are small, spherical and contain only one seed.  Ashoka trees are small in height, while false ashoka is taller.

==Other names==
This tree has a multitude of names in [[Indian literature]]. Some names for the ashoka tree and its flowers include: 
*In [[Sanskrit]]: ashoka, Sita-ashoka, anganapriya, ashopalava, ashoka, asupala, apashaka, hemapushpa, kankeli, madhupushpa, pindapushpa, pindipushpa, vanjula, vishoka and vichitra.
*Other languages: thawgabo, thawka ([[Burmese language|Burmese]]), vand ichitrah, sita ashoka ([[Hindi]]), ashok ([[Assamese language|Assamese]]), oshok ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]), (piNTi) ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]), asokam ([[Malayalam]]), asokamu, vanjulamu ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]), aasopalav ([[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]), sokanam [[Thai language|Thai]], diyaratmal, diyeratembela ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]), nikabilissa ([[Dhivehi language|Divehi]]), achenge, akshth, ashanke, kenkalimara ([[Kannada]]),({{lang-mr|सीता अशोक}}) gapis, tengalan ([[Malay language|Malay]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botanical.com/site/column_poudhia/91_sita.html Sita Ashok (Saraca indica) as medicinal herb in Chhattisgarh, India: Natural Occurrence, Traditional Medicinal knowledge and Trade] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218113850/http://www.botanical.com/site/column_poudhia/91_sita.html |date=February 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses of Ashoka Tree ==
The bark of the Ashoka plant is used to prepare cosmetics that help to improve skin complexion. It helps to prevent the condition of scanty and difficult for urination and even acts as an antidote to scorpion bite. Even its dried flowers are advantageous for diabetic patients.

'''Tianlian I''' ([[Simplified Chinese]]: 天链一号, [[Traditional Chinese]]: 天鏈一號, English: ''Sky Chain''), also known as '''Tian Lian 1''', '''TL-1''', and '''CTDRS-1''' is a [[China|Chinese]] data tracking and relay [[communications satellite]] series.
