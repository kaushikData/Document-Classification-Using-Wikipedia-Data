The '''A606''' is an [[A roads in Great Britain|A road]] in [[England]] that starts in [[West Bridgford]] {{nowrap|({{coord|52.9274|-1.1299|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A606 road (northern end)}})}} and heads southeastwards through [[Leicestershire]] and the towns of [[Melton Mowbray]] and [[Oakham]], terminating at [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]] {{nowrap|({{coord|52.6528|-0.4836|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A606 road (southern end)}}),}} on the former Great North Road.

==History==
The route in earlier times was a far more important route than it is today. It was the main road from Nottingham to London. The turnpike went from Nottingham via Melton and Oakham to [[Kettering]] (to join today's [[A6 road (England)|A6]]), and then on to London, run by the Nottingham, Melton and Kettering Turnpike Trust from 1758. The turnpike trusts were abolished in 1880, the year that the railway line to Melton opened. The trains would run until 1968.

==Route==
===Nottingham to Melton===
[[File:Edwalton - Melton Road - geograph.org.uk - 1215929.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Melton Road in [[Edwalton, Nottinghamshire|Edwalton]] ]]
The road begins a few hundred yards south of Nottinghamshire County Hall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2397196 |title=Nottinghamshire County Hall:: OS grid SK5837 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; (built in 1937), in [[West Bridgford]] in the district of [[Rushcliffe]], at the traffic lights junction of the [[A60 road|A60]] (for Loughborough) and the B679 (for [[Wilford]]). The section to Melton follows the former railway from Nottingham to Melton, now the [[Old Dalby Test Track]], and to the [[A46 road|A46]] junction is only a few hundred metres apart. The line then continued from Melton to Oakham, then on to Corby and Kettering, and was the fastest route to [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]] by train from [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras]]. It followed the exact line of the former [[Turnpike trust|turnpike]].

It begins as ''Melton Road'', and passes two churches then crosses the former railway line to Melton, and the [[BP]] ''Melton Road Filling Station''. There is traffic lights at a crossroad for ''Valley Road'', to the left, and ''Boundary Road'', to the right (for Rushcliffe Leisure Centre and [[Rushcliffe School]]). In [[Edwalton, Nottinghamshire|Edwalton]], the road then crosses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/983158 |title=Melton Road near Edwalton:: OS grid SK5934 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the former railway, where a few hundred metres further south it is still accessible by train. To the right is Wheatcrofts garden centre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/983166 |title=Wheatcrofts Garden Centre:: OS grid SK5934 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; (started by [[Harry Wheatcroft]]) and the road meets the A52 at a busy roundabout,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/983162 |title=Approach to the Ring Road roundabout:: OS grid SK5934 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the road exits to the east as a [[trunk road]].

[[File:A606 at Tollerton - geograph.org.uk - 1614764.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Entering [[Tollerton, Nottinghamshire|Tollerton]] from the low bridge]]
There is a 14&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;in low bridge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1614753 |title=Only high vehicles allowed:: OS grid SK6034 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the former railway), so there is a turning point&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1614762 |title=High vehicle turnback (1):: OS grid SK5934 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; for high vehicles. For the next mile the road&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1614764 |title=A606 at Tollerton:: OS grid SK6034 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the parish boundary between [[Tollerton, Nottinghamshire|Tollerton]] to the left, and [[Plumtree, Nottinghamshire|Plumtree]], to the right. It passes Tollerton post office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=more nearby |url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2152046 |title=Tollerton Post Office:: OS grid SK6033 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date=2010-11-09 |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is traffic lights for ''Tollerton Lane'' (for [[Nottingham Airport]]), where there is the [[Total S.A.|TOTAL]] ''Lane End Garage''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/186205 |title=Tollerton Lane, near Nottingham:: OS grid SK6033 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The road becomes the parish boundary between Plumtree and [[Normanton-on-the-Wolds]], to the left. The former A606 used to go through both villages before 1930. At the end of the joint bypass, there is a right turn for the [[British Geological Survey]]. It passes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/185849 |title=A607, Nottingham to Melton Mowbray road:: OS grid SK6331 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[Stanton-on-the-Wolds]]. At the junction for [[Keyworth]], there is the [[Murco Petroleum Ltd|Murco]] ''Wolds Service Station''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/159626 |title=Petrol station at Stanton-on-the-Wolds:: OS grid SK6430 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a crossroads, there is access to [[Widmerpool]], to the right, and the former [[Widmerpool railway station]]. The road meets the dual-carriageway [[A46 road|A46]] at an interchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/102589 |title=Bridge Over A46(T):: OS grid SK6528 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date=2006-01-07 |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point is the southern end of the A46 Newark to Widmerpool Improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4403.aspx |title=Newark to Widmerpool |publisher=Highways.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A606 on Broughton Hill - geograph.org.uk - 134450.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Broughton Hill]]
At Hickling Pastures, it passes Turnpike Farm, and there is a left turn for [[Hickling, Nottinghamshire|Hickling]]. The road becomes more hilly, and it passes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/908313 |title=A606 Melton Road near Upper Broughton:: OS grid SK6826 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[Upper Broughton]] and its ''Golden Fleece''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diningpubs.co.uk/pub_details.asp?id=704 |title=East Midlands |publisher=Dining Pubs |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325110133/http://www.diningpubs.co.uk/pub_details.asp?id=704 |archivedate=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crossing the Dalby Brook, the road enters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/908355 |title=A606 Melton Road enters Leicestershire:: OS grid SK6926 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leicestershire]] and the district of [[Melton (borough)|Melton]]. In [[Broughton and Old Dalby]], it passes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/908352 |title=A606 Main Road in Nether Broughton:: OS grid SK6925 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[Nether Broughton]], and its ''Anchor Inn''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diningpubs.co.uk/pub_details.asp?id=702 |title=East Midlands |publisher=Dining Pubs |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325110140/http://www.diningpubs.co.uk/pub_details.asp?id=702 |archivedate=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Red House''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-redhouse.co.uk |title=pub, hotel &amp; restaurant |publisher=The Red House |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The road is crossed by a pylon line,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/908361 |title=A606 Nottingham Road:: OS grid SK7025 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ascends Broughton Hill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/908365 |title=A606 Nottingham Road towards Broughton Hill:: OS grid SK7024 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the road rises 80 metres in 0.5&amp;nbsp;km.

[[File:Ab Kettleby, The Sugar Loaf.jpg|thumb|140px|left|''Sugar Loaf'' in [[Ab Kettleby]] ]]
On the top of the hill, there are crossroads, which is highest point of the road at 171 metres, for a former Roman road (''Six Hills Lane'') that follows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/909350 |title=Road near Ab Kettleby:: OS grid SK7223 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the northern ridge of the wolds, where the right turn is for [[Wartnaby]]. The road descends down a hill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/909439 |title=The Sugar Loaf, Ab Kettleby:: OS grid SK7223 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; into [[Ab Kettleby]], the former home of [[Desert Orchid]], passing the ''Sugar Loaf'' on the left. The road descends down the side of a valley and up onto Potter Hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/142752 |title=Potter Hill near Melton Mowbray:: OS grid SK7322 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date=2006-03-26 |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point the road enters the parish of [[Melton Mowbray]] as ''Nottingham Road''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/68442 |title=Nottingham Road, Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire:: OS grid SK7420 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It passes the [[Esso]] ''Brookside Service Station'' and the headquarters of [[East Midlands Councils]], and Melton Borough Council on the right. It meets the [[A607 road|A607]] and A6006 at traffic lights and crossroads. Previously the road went straight through the town centre, which is now pedestrianised as ''Nottingham Street''. The southbound road now follows the A607 to the east on ''Norman Way'', then follows ''Thorpe End'' and ''Sherrard Street'' to the west, in a convoluted route through the town centre. The northbound route follows ''Leicester Street'' then ''Wilton Road''. Both meet at an awkward junction at the ''Anne of Cleves'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.everards.co.uk/pubs/anne_of_cleves_6/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927083039/http://www.everards.co.uk/pubs/anne_of_cleves_6/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-09-27 |title=The Anne of Cleves, Melton Mowbray |publisher=Everards |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; onto ''[[Burton Lazars|Burton]] Road''.

===Melton to Stamford===
[[File:Potter Hill near Melton Mowbray - geograph.org.uk - 142752.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Potter Hill, north-west of [[Melton Mowbray]] ]]
The road passes [[Melton Mowbray railway station]], and crosses the [[Birmingham to Peterborough Line]] and the [[River Eye, Leicestershire|River Eye]]. The road climbs the side of the River Eye's valley out of Melton, passing the former [[King Edward VII School (Melton Mowbray)|King Edward VII School]]. In [[Burton and Dalby]] it passes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/779527 |title=A606 Burton Road towards Melton Mowbray:: OS grid SK7617 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[Burton Lazars]], and St James church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1353983 |title=St James Church Burton Lazars:: OS grid SK7616 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date=2009-06-14 |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is crossed by the [[Jubilee Way]].

The road climbs to the top of a hill, where it becomes the boundary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/772990 |title=A606 Oakham Road enters Leicestershire:: OS grid SK8013 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date=2008-04-21 |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; between Rutland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/772987 |title=A606 Oakham Road enters Rutland:: OS grid SK8013 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date=2008-04-21 |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; (to the left) and [[Leicestershire]] (to the right), reaching 160 metres at Green's Lodge. Rutland became independent in April 1997. Leaving the Rutland boundary, the road descends to reach Whissendine Brook, and there is a left turn for Whissendine, and a right turn for [[Cold Overton]] and Northfield Farm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northfieldfarm.com |title=Northfield Farm Shop and Restaurant - Home |publisher=Northfieldfarm.com |date=2011-11-19 |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; (both in Leicestershire).

In [[Langham, Rutland|Langham]] it ascends the side of Ranksborough Hill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/149019 |title=Ranksborough Hill near Langham:: OS grid SK8211 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date=2006-04-09 |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; (at 191 metres, the second highest in Rutland), to reach 166 metres. Descending down the hill, it passes a right turn for Ranksborough Hall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ranksboroughhall.com |title=Park Homes, Leisure Homes &amp;#124; Ranksborough Hall Rutland |publisher=Ranksboroughhall.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; an activity centre.

In [[mathematics]], '''abuse of notation''' occurs when an author uses a [[mathematical notation]] in a way that is not formally correct but that seems likely to simplify the exposition or suggest the correct [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] (while being unlikely to introduce errors or cause confusion). However, the concept of formal correctness depends on time and on the context. Therefore, many notations in mathematics are qualified as abuse of notation in some context and are formally correct in other contexts; as many notations were introduced a long time before any formalization of the theory in which they are used, the qualification of abuse of notation is strongly time dependent. Moreover, many abuses of notation may be made formally correct by improving the theory.  ''Abuse of notation'' should be contrasted with ''misuse'' of notation, which should be avoided.

{{anchor|Abuse of language}} A related concept is '''abuse of language''' or '''abuse of terminology,''' when not notation but a ''term'' is misused. Abuse of language is an almost synonymous expression that is usually used for non-notational abuses. For example, while the word [[group representation|''representation'']] properly designates a [[group homomorphism]] from a [[Group theory|group]] ''G'' to [[General linear group|GL(''V'')]], where ''V'' is a [[vector space]], it is common to call ''V'' "a representation of ''G''". A common abuse of language consists in identifying two mathematical objects that are different but [[canonical isomorphism|canonically isomorphic]]. Examples include identifying a [[constant function]] and its value or identifying to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^3&lt;/math&gt; the [[Euclidean space]] of dimension three equipped with a [[Cartesian coordinate system]].

==Examples==
===Structured mathematical objects===
Many [[mathematical object]]s consist of a [[set (mathematics)|set]], often called the underlying set, equipped with some additional structure, typically a [[mathematical operation]] or a [[topological space|topology]]. It is a common abuse of notation to use the same notation for the underlying set and the structured object. For example, &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z&lt;/math&gt; may denote the set of the [[integer]]s, the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of integers together with [[addition]], or the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of integers with addition and [[multiplication]]. In general, there is no problem with this, and avoiding such an abuse of notation would make mathematical texts pedantic and difficult to read. When this abuse of notation may be confusing, one may distinguish between these structures by  denoting &lt;math&gt;(\Bbb Z, +)&lt;/math&gt; the group of integers with addition, and &lt;math&gt;(\Bbb Z, +, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt; the ring of integers.

Similarly, a [[topological space]] consists of a set {{math|''X''}} (the underlying set) and a topology &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T},&lt;/math&gt; which is characterized by a set of [[subset]]s of {{math|''X''}} (the [[open set]]s). Most frequently, one considers only one topology on {{math|''X''}}, and there is no problem to denote by {{math|''X''}} both the underlying set, and the pair consisting of {{math|''X''}} and its topology &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T},&lt;/math&gt; although they are different mathematical objects. Nevertheless, it occurs sometimes that two different topologies are considered simultaneously on the same set; for distinguishing the corresponding topological spaces, one must use notation such as &lt;math&gt;(X, \mathcal{T})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(X, \mathcal{T}').&lt;/math&gt;

===Functional notation===

One encounters, in many textbooks, sentences such as "Let {{math|''f''(''x'')}} be a function ...". This is an abuse of notation, as the name of the function is {{mvar|f}}, and {{math|''f''(''x'')}} denotes normally the value of the function {{mvar|f}} for the element {{mvar|x}} of its domain. The correct phrase would be "Let {{mvar|f}} be a function of the variable {{mvar|x}} ..." or "Let {{math|''x'' ↦ ''f''(''x'')}} be a function ..."  This abuse of notation is widely used, as it simplifies the formulation, and the systematic use of a correct notation quickly becomes pedantic.

A similar abuse of notation occurs in sentences such as "Let us consider the function {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x'' + 1}}..." In fact {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x'' + 1}} is not a function. The function is the operation that associates {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x'' + 1}} to {{mvar|''x''}}, often denoted as {{math|''x'' ↦ ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x'' + 1}}. Nevertheless, this abuse of notation is widely used since it is generally not confusing.

===Equality vs. isomorphism===

Many mathematical structures are defined through a characterizing property (often a [[universal property]]). Once this desired property is defined, there may be various ways to construct the structure, and the corresponding results are formally different objects, but which have exactly the same properties – they are [[isomorphic]]. As there is no way to distinguish these isomorphic objects through their properties, it is standard to consider them as equal, even if this is formally wrong.

One example of this the [[Cartesian product]], which is often seen as associative:
:&lt;math&gt;(E \times F) \times G = E \times (F \times G) = E \times F \times G&lt;/math&gt;.

But this is not strictly true: if &lt;math&gt;x \in E&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y \in F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z \in G&lt;/math&gt;, the identity &lt;math&gt;((x, y), z) = (x, (y, z))&lt;/math&gt; would imply that &lt;math&gt;(x, y) = x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z = (y, z)&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;((x, y), z) = (x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt; would mean nothing.

This notion can be made rigorous in [[category theory]], using the idea of a [[natural isomorphism]].

Another example occurs in such statements as "there are two non-Abelian groups of order 8", which more strictly stated means "there are two isomorphism classes of non-Abelian groups of order 8".

===Equivalence classes===
Referring to an [[equivalence class]] of an [[equivalence relation]] by ''x'' instead of [''x''] is an abuse of notation. Formally, if a set ''X'' is [[partition of a set|partition]]ed by an equivalence relation ~, then for each ''x'' ∈ ''X'', the equivalence class {''y'' ∈ ''X'' | ''y'' ~ ''x''} is denoted [''x'']. But in practice, if the remainder of the discussion is focused on equivalence classes rather than individual elements of the underlying set, it is common to drop the square brackets in the discussion.

For example, in [[modular arithmetic]], a [[finite group]] of [[order (group theory)|order]] ''n'' can be formed by partitioning the integers via the equivalence relation ''x'' ~ ''y'' if and only if ''x'' &amp;equiv; ''y'' (mod ''n''). The elements of that group would then be [0], [1], &amp;hellip;, [''n'' − 1], but in practice they are usually just denoted 0, 1, &amp;hellip;, ''n'' − 1.

Another example is the space of (classes of) measurable functions over a [[measure space]], or classes of [[Lebesgue integral|Lebesgue integrable]] functions, where the equivalence relation is equality "[[almost everywhere]]".

==Subjectivity==
The terms "abuse of language" and "abuse of notation" depend on context. Writing "''f'': ''A'' → ''B''" for a [[partial function]] from ''A'' to ''B'' is almost always an abuse of notation, but not in a [[category (mathematics)|category theoretic]] context, where ''f'' can be seen as a [[morphism]] in the category of sets and partial functions.

'''Academy Glacier''' ({{coord|84|15|S|061|00|W|type:glacier_region:AQ|display=inline}}) is a major [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] [[glacier]] in the [[Pensacola Mountains]], draining northwestward between the [[Patuxent Range|Patuxent]] and [[Neptune Range|Neptune]] [[mountain range|ranges]] to enter [[Foundation Ice Stream]].

It was mapped by the [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] from surveys and US Navy air photos in 1956-66, and was named by the [[Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names|US-ACAN]] for the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] which played an important role in the planning of the U.S. program in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://geographic.org/geographic_names/antname.php?uni=36&amp;fid=antgeo_101|title=Academy Glacier, Antarctica|website=Geographical Names|publisher=|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1478">'''Auroral kilometric radiation''' ('''AKR''') is the intense radio [[radiation]] emitted in the acceleration zone (at a height of three times the radius of the Earth) of the polar lights. The radiation mainly comes from [[cyclotron radiation]] from [[electrons]] orbiting around the [[magnetic field]] lines of the Earth. The radiation has a [[frequency]] of between 50 and 500&amp;nbsp;kHz and a total [[Power (physics)|power]] of between about 1 million and 10 million [[watt]]s. The radiation is absorbed by the [[ionosphere]] and therefore can only be measured by [[satellites]] positioned at vast heights, such as the [[Fast Auroral Snapshot Explorer (FAST)]]. According to the data of the [[Cluster mission]], it is beamed out in the cosmos in a narrow plane tangent to the magnetic field at the source.  The sound produced by playing AKR over an audio device has been described as "whistles", "chirps", and even "screams"{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}.

As some other planets emit cyclotron radiation too, AKR could be used to learn more about [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]], and to detect [[extrasolar planet]]s.

{{For|an organization that contributes money to an associated club or sports team|Booster club}}

'''Boosterism''' is the act of promoting ("boosting") a town, city, or organization, with the goal of improving public perception of it. Boosting can be as simple as talking up the entity at a party or as elaborate as establishing a visitors' bureau. It has been somewhat associated with American small [[town]]s.  Boosting is also done in political settings, especially in regard to disputed policies or controversial events.

==History==
During the expansion of the American and [[Canada|Canadian]] West, boosterism became epidemic as the leaders and owners of small towns made extravagant predictions for their settlement, in the hope of attracting more residents and, not coincidentally, inflating the prices of local [[real estate]].

The 1871 humorous speech ''The Untold Delights of [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]'', delivered by Democratic U.S. Representative [[J. Proctor Knott]], lampooned boosterism.  Boosterism is also a major theme of two [[novel]]s by [[Sinclair Lewis]]&amp;mdash;''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'' (published 1920) and ''[[Babbitt (novel)|Babbitt]]'' (1922). As indicated by an editorial that Lewis wrote in 1908 entitled "The Needful Knocker", boosting was the opposite of knocking. The editorial explained:

{{quote|The booster's enthusiasm is the motive force which builds up our American cities. Granted. But the hated knocker's jibes are the check necessary to guide that force. In summary then, we do not wish to knock the booster, but we certainly do wish to boost the knocker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/columnists/fionola-meredith/dont-let-punks-become-pr-men-just-to-reel-in-tourists-28757381.html|title=Don’t let punks become PR men just to reel in tourists|publisher=|author=Fionola Meredith|date=June 7, 2012|work=Belfast Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Schorer, M.: ''Sinclair Lewis: An American Life'', page 142.  McGraw-Hill, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Carey mask1.jpg|thumb|250px|Carey mask]]
A '''Carey mask''' (named after the inventor, George Carey) is a [[focusing screen|focusing aid]] for [[telescopes|astronomical telescopes]]. The mask is in the form of a thin card or sheet that is placed over the front [[aperture]] of the telescope. There are four series of slits in the mask which form a [[diffraction]] pattern in the image plane.

In this example the two sets of slits on the left are angled at 12 degrees to each other. Those on the right are angled at 10 degrees to each other. Different telescope and imaging combinations may require slightly different angles.

The diffraction pattern caused by the left hand slits will be in the form of an 'X'.
The right hand slits will also form an 'X' shape, but the lines forming the 'X' will cross at a narrower angle.
When perfect focus is achieved the two 'X's will be superimposed and be perfectly symmetrical.
Any slight error in focus will cause the 'X's to be offset, and this is very noticeable to the naked eye.

In the example images below, [[focus error]] is obvious in the first two images. The third image is very close to perfect focus as shown by the equal spacing between the elongated spikes on the left and the right.

[[File:Focussing.jpg|400px]]

A negative image can sometimes show the [[diffraction]] spikes more clearly.

[[File:Focussing neg.jpg|200px]]

The enlarged view below shows the left hand spikes to be slightly further apart than those on the right. This is an indication that the focus knob needs to be rotated slightly '''anti-clockwise'''. If the right hand spikes were further apart, a '''clockwise''' rotation would be needed. The mask should always be placed over the aperture with the same [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]]. If the mask was rotated 180 degrees, then the focus knob directions would be reversed. The operator soon becomes familiar with the rotation directions needed for a given setup.

[[File:Detail of focus.jpg|200px]]

This indication of the direction of focus change needed removes much of the trial and error that can often be encountered when attempting [[astrophotography]].

The '''European Spatial Development Perspective''' (ESDP) is a document approved by the Informal Council of Ministers of Spatial Planning of [[European Commission]] in [[Potsdam]] in 1999. It is a legally non-binding document forming a policy framework with 60 policy options for all tiers of [[Administration (business)|administration]] with a planning responsibility. The [[strategic]] aim is to achieve a balanced and [[sustainable]] [[spatial development]] strategy.

== Key concepts ==
With the aim to provide an [[Regional integration|integrated]], multi-sectoral and indicative [[strategy]] for the [[spatial development]], the key ideas of ESDP are: 
* an integrated approach - Not just to look at specific sectors of development activity (e.g. environment, economic development, or transport), but to recognise that they all affect each other; 
* spatial development - a much wider view of the development, vital for integrative approach; 
* strategic aspects - interlinked actions to achieve balanced and sustainable territorial development; 
* indicative views - the responsibility lies with the developed regions and territories to implement the development principals.

== Spatial policy guidelines ==
# Development of a [[wikt:polycentric|polycentric]] and balanced urban system, and strengthening of the partnership between urban and rural areas, so as to create a new urban-rural relationship.
# Promotion of integrated transport and communication concepts, which support the polycentric development of the EU territory, so that there is gradual progress towards parity of access to infrastructure and knowledge. 
# Wise management of the natural and cultural heritage, which will help conserve regional identities and cultural diversity in the face of globalisation.

Casey|date=1986-01-01|publisher=Geological Society of America|isbn=9780813711669|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fissility is differentiated from scaly fabric in hand sample by the parting surfaces’ continuously parallel orientations to each other and to stratification. Fissility is distinguished from scaly fabric in thin section by the well-developed orientation of platy minerals such as [[mica]]. Fissility is the result of sedimentary or metamorphic processes.

Planes of weakness are developed in sedimentary rocks such as [[shale]] or [[mudstone]] by clay particles aligning during [[Compaction (geology)|compaction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ju0DAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=fissility&amp;f=false|title=Sedimentary Petrology: An Introduction to the Origin of Sedimentary Rocks|last=Tucker|first=Maurice E.|date=2013-05-22|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=1118698908|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A rock’s fissility can be degraded in numerous ways during the geologic process, including clay particles [[Flocculation|flocculating]] into a random fabric before compaction, [[bioturbation]] during compaction, and [[weathering]] during and after uplift. The effect of bioturbation has been documented well in shale cores sampled: past variable critical depths where burrowing organisms can no longer survive, shale fissility will become more pervasive and better defined.

Fissility is used by some geologists as the defining characteristic which separates mudstone (no fissility) from shale (fissile)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gcgp5oLFrZMC&amp;dq=fissility&amp;q=fissility#v=snippet&amp;q=fissility&amp;f=false|title=Sedimentology and Stratigraphy|last=Nichols|first=Gary|date=2013-04-30|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118687772|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope''' ('''FAST'''; {{zh|s=五百米口径球面射电望远镜}}), nicknamed '''Tianyan''' ({{lang|zh-Hans|天眼}}, lit.

==Overview==
FAST has a fixed primary reflector located in a natural [[sinkhole]] in the landscape ([[karst]]), focusing radio waves on a receiving antenna in a "feed cabin" suspended {{cvt|140|m}} above it.  The reflector is made of perforated aluminium panels supported by a mesh of steel cables hanging from the rim.

FAST's surface is made of 4450{{r|Xinhua complete}} triangular panels, {{cvt|11|m}} on a side,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=China assembles world's largest telescope in Guizhou |date=24 July 2015 |url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/2015-07/24/content_36136455.htm |publisher=Xinhua |via=China.org.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of a [[geodesic dome]]. 2225 winches located underneath&lt;ref name=Normile&gt;{{cite news |title=World’s largest radio telescope will search for dark matter, listen for aliens |first=Dennis |last=Normile |date=26 September 2016 |journal=Science News |url=http://www.sciencepubs.com/news/2016/09/world-s-largest-radio-telescope-will-search-dark-matter-listen-aliens |doi=10.1126/science.aah7346}}&lt;/ref&gt; make it an [[Active optics|active surface]], pulling on joints between panels, deforming the flexible steel cable support into a [[parabolic antenna]] aligned with the desired sky direction.&lt;ref name=ohio&gt;{{Cite report |first=R.L.

It describes in some detail (at the end of p. 4) the fact that FAST's dish is actually 519.6&amp;nbsp;m in diameter; papers published by the project scientists, who would presumably know, are explicit that the dish extends "up to a girder ring of exactly 500&amp;nbsp;m diameter".&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the reflector diameter is {{convert|500|m}}, only a circle of 300&amp;nbsp;m diameter is used (held in the correct parabolic shape and "illuminated" by the receiver) at any one time.{{r|arxiv|p=13}}  Thus, the name is a misnomer: the [[aperture]] is not 500&amp;nbsp;m, nor is it spherical.&lt;!-- Pretty sure this is a historical accident: it was planned to be more Arecibo-like, but the larger size made the heavy aberration-compensating receiver impractical to suspend. --&gt;&lt;!-- Actually, probably not; it appears to be derived from the earlier KARST proposal for the SKA, which already had the deformable primary.  And Arecibo doesn't have a full-aperture primary, either!--&gt;

It could be improved slightly, but the size of the triangular segments limits the shortest wavelength which can be received.

The FAST telescope joined the [[Breakthrough Listen]] [[SETI]] project in October 2016 to search for intelligent extraterrestrial communications in the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://astrobiology.com/2016/10/national-astronomical-observatories-of-china-breakthrough-initiatives-launch-global-collaboration-in.html |title=National Astronomical Observatories of China, Breakthrough Initiatives Launch Global Collaboration in Search for Intelligent life in the Universe |publisher=Breakthrough Initiatives |via=Astrobiology Web |date=12 October 2016 |accessdate=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staffing==

The primary driving force behind the project{{r|Normile}} was [[Nan Rendong]] ({{lang|zh-Hans|南仁东}}), a researcher with the [[Chinese National Astronomical Observatory]], part of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]].  He held the positions of chief scientist{{r|CNN 2015}} and chief engineer{{r|Normile}} of the project. He passed away on 15 September 2017 in Boston due to lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chinanews.com/m/gn/2017/09-16/8332735.shtml |title=&lt;span lang="zh-Hans"&gt;中国天眼"首席科学家南仁东病逝 享年72岁&lt;/span&gt; |journal=China News Service |date=16 September 2017 |language=zh-Hans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy has been having difficulty finding staff for the telescope.&lt;ref name=wanted&gt;{{cite news |title=Wanted: Researchers for China’s mega telescope to interpret signals from across the universe |date=31 October 2018 |first=Alice |last=Shen |journal=[[South China Morning Post]] |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/2171002/wanted-researchers-chinas-mega-telescope-interpret-signals-across}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=helpwanted&gt;{{cite news |title=China still having trouble staffing up its mega-telescope |first=Eric |last=Berger |date=5 November 2018 |journal=[[Ars Technica]] |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/11/china-still-having-trouble-staffing-up-its-mega-telescope/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its size requires a large staff, but they are having difficulty attracting astronomers to its remote location, making it unlikely that the telescope will operate at full capacity for some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://m.china.caixin.com/m/2016-09-25/100991650.html |date=25 September 2016 |title=&lt;span lang="zh-Hans"&gt;院士：建世界最大射电望远镜不是为了发展旅游&lt;/span&gt; |language=zh |journal=[[Caixin]] Online}} There is an [http://english.caixin.com/2016-09-26/100992047.html English-language version of the article], but that does not mention this issue，which is only described in the much longer and more detailed Chinese version.&lt;/ref&gt;  As China has few radio astronomers, they are soliciting staff internationally, but the pay offered is low, and many are worried about heavy-handed management for this high-profile project.{{r|wanted|helpwanted}}

The Academy has likewise been searching for a qualified director of scientific operations for FAST since May 2017, but has not been able to fill the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=China is offering over a million dollars for a foreigner to run the world’s largest telescope, so why is nobody applying? |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2105278/china-offering-over-million-dollars-foreigner-run-worlds-largest |journal=[[South China Morning Post]] |date=3 August 2017 |first=Stephen |last=Chen}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|wanted|helpwanted}}  Although an offer of {{US$|1.2 million}} is widely quoted, this is primarily a one-time research grant, not salary or ongoing support.{{r|helpwanted}}

==Comparison with Arecibo Observatory==
[[File:Comparison FAST Arecibo Observatory profiles.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Comparison of the [[Arecibo Observatory]] (top) and FAST (bottom) dishes at the same scale]]

The basic design of FAST is similar to the [[Arecibo Observatory]] radio telescope.  Both are fixed primary reflectors installed in natural hollows, made of perforated aluminum panels with a movable receiver suspended above.  And both have an effective aperture smaller than the physical size of the primary.  There are, however, five significant differences in addition to the size.{{r|ohio}}&lt;ref name=optics&gt;{{Cite conference |title=The optics of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope |conference=International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation |location=Nanjing |date=23 October 2013 |first1=Chengjin |last1=Jin |first2=Kai |last2=Zhu |first3=Jin |last3=Fan  |first4=Hongfei |last4=Liu |first5=Yan |last5=Zhu |first6=Hengqian |last6=Gan |first7=Jinglong |last7=Yu |first8=Zhisheng |last8=Gao |first9=Yang |last9=Cao |first10=Yang |last10=Wu |institution=National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences |url=http://ap-s.ei.tuat.ac.jp/isapx/2013/pdf/339_2_0.pdf |conference-url=http://ap-s.ei.tuat.ac.jp/isapx/2013/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Qiu11&gt;{{cite journal |title=A novel design for a giant Arecibo-type spherical radio telescope with an active main reflector |first=Yuhai H. |last=Qiu |institution=Beijing Astronomical Observatory, The Chinese Academy of Sciences |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=301 |issue=3 |pages=827–830 |date=11 December 1998 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-8711.1998.02067.x |url=http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/301/3/827.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, Arecibo's dish is fixed in a spherical shape.  Although it is also suspended from steel cables with supports underneath for fine-tuning the shape, they are manually operated and adjusted only for maintenance.{{r|ohio}}  It has a fixed spherical shape and two additional reflectors suspended above to correct for the resultant [[spherical aberration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |title=AOPAF: Arecibo Observatory Phased Array Feed |first=Germán |last=Cortés-Medellín |date=13 September 2010 |institution=National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center, Cornell University |url=https://www.naic.edu/~phil/hardware/byuPhasedAr/logs/Cortes%20AOPAF_short%20report%20Sept%202010-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, Arecibo's receiver platform is fixed in place.  To support the greater weight of the additional reflectors, the primary support cables are static, with the only motorised portion being three hold-down winches which compensate for [[thermal expansion]].{{r|ohio|p=3}}  The antennas are mounted on a rotating arm below the platform.{{r|ohio|p=4}}  This smaller range of motion limits it to viewing objects within 19.7° of the zenith.&lt;ref name=Arecibo&gt;{{Cite web |title=Arecibo: General Statistical Information on Antenna |url=https://www.naic.edu/~astro/general_info/basic.shtml |date=3 January 2005 |website=National Astronomy and Ionospheric Center |accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, Arecibo can receive higher frequencies.  The finite size of the triangular panels making up FAST's primary reflector limits the accuracy with which it can approximate a parabola, and thus the shortest wavelength it can focus.  Arecibo's more rigid design allows it to maintain sharp focus down to 3&amp;nbsp;cm wavelength (10&amp;nbsp;GHz); FAST is limited to 10&amp;nbsp;cm (3&amp;nbsp;GHz).  Improvements in position control of the secondary might be able to push that to 6&amp;nbsp;cm (5&amp;nbsp;GHz), but then the primary reflector becomes a hard limit.

Fourth, the FAST dish is significantly deeper, contributing to a wider field of view.  Although {{#expr:100*(500 / {{convert|1000|ft|m|5|disp=number}} - 1) round 0}}% larger in diameter, FAST's radius of curvature is {{cvt|300|m}},{{r|arxiv|p=3}} barely larger than Arecibo's {{cvt|870|ft|order=flip}},{{r|Arecibo}} so it forms a {{#expr:360/pi*asin(500/2/300) round 0}}° arc{{r|arxiv|p=4}} (vs. {{#expr:360/pi*asin(1000/2/870) round 0}}° for Arecibo).  Although Arecibo's full aperture of {{cvt|1000|ft|m|0|order=flip}} can be used when observing objects at the [[zenith]], the effective aperture for more typical inclined observations is {{cvt|725|ft|m|order=flip}}.{{r|ohio|p=4}} (This is partially compensated for by Arecibo's location closer to the equator, so the Earth's rotation scans a larger fraction of the sky.  Arecibo is located at 18.35°&amp;nbsp;N latitude, while FAST is sited about 7.5° farther north, at about 25.80°&amp;nbsp;N.)

Fifth, Arecibo's larger secondary platform also houses several ''transmitters'', making it one of only two instruments in the world capable of [[radar astronomy]].  The NASA-funded Planetary Radar System allows Arecibo to study solid objects from Mercury to Saturn, and to perform very accurate [[orbit determination]] on [[near-earth object]]s, particularly [[potentially hazardous object]]s.  Arecibo also includes several NSF funded radars for ionospheric studies.  These powerful transmitters are too large and heavy for FAST's small receiver cabin, so it will not be able to participate in [[planetary defense]].

[[File:Fort Mandan.JPG|thumb|right|300 px|Winter view of reconstructed Fort Mandan, North Dakota]]'''Fort Mandan''' was the name of the encampment which the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] built for wintering over in 1804-1805.  The encampment was located on the [[Missouri River]] approximately twelve miles from the site of present-day [[Washburn, North Dakota]], which developed later. The precise location is not known for certain and is believed now to be under the water of the river. A replica of the fort has been constructed near the original site.&lt;ref name="fortmandan"/&gt;

==Construction and conditions==
[[File:001 Fort Mandan Interior.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Interior yard of the replica of Fort Mandan, North Dakota]]
The fort was built of [[Populus sect. Aegiros|cottonwood]] lumber cut from the riverbanks.  It was triangular in shape, with high walls on all sides, an interior open space between structures, and a gate facing the Missouri River, by which the party would normally travel. Storage rooms provided a safe place to keep supplies. Lewis and Clark shared a room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/read/?_xmlsrc=1804-11-03&amp;_xslsrc=LCstyles.xsl Gary Moulton, ed., ''Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition Online'', 3 November 1804], University of Nebraska Press&lt;/ref&gt; The men of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Corps of Discovery]] started the fort on November 2, 1804. They wintered there until April 6, 1805. According to the journals, they built the fort slightly downriver from the [[Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site|five villages]] of the [[Mandan]] and [[Hidatsa]] nations.

The winter was very cold, with temperatures sometimes dipping to minus 45 degrees Fahrenheit (-43°C),&lt;ref&gt;Gary E. Moulton, ed, ''The Definitive Journals of Lewis &amp; Clark,'' Vol. 3: ''Up the Missouri to Fort Mandan'' (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1987), p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; but the fort provided some protection from the elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/read/?_xmlsrc=1804-11-05&amp;_xslsrc=LCstyles.xsl Moulton, ''Journals Online'', 5 November 1804], University of Nebraska, Lincoln&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the men of the expedition suffered [[frostbite]] due to the severely cold conditions, which affected them even with brief exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Moulton (1987), Vol. 3, ''Up the Missouri,'' pp. 254-255.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomacy==
[[File:Captains' Room at Fort Mandan.JPG|thumb|right|300 px|Lewis and Clark's room at the reconstructed fort]]In addition to seeking protection during the winter, Captains [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] spent much of this period on diplomatic efforts with the several [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes who lived near the fort. As the expedition established the first official contact between the [[United States]] and these nations, President [[Thomas Jefferson]] had directed the captains to pursue diplomatic goals. They were to try to establish friendly relationships with as many tribes as possible, and to prepare them for the arrival of United States traders to the region.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Jackson, ed., ''Letters of the Lewis and Clark Expedition with Related Documents,'' 2nd ed., vol. 1 (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1978.), 64.&lt;/ref&gt; They were also to claim United States territorial [[sovereignty]] over the land, which had been occupied by Native Americans for thousands of years.&lt;ref name="rhonda81-83"/&gt; The historic tribes had differing conceptions of property use than did the European Americans.

The [[Lakota people|Teton]] people had already shown resistance to the expedition. Lewis and Clark gradually adjusted their goals, working to form alliances with the [[Arikara]], [[Hidatsa people|Hidatsa]], and [[Mandan]] against the Teton.&lt;ref name="rhonda81-83"&gt;James P. Rhonda, ''Lewis and Clark among the Indians'' (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1984), 81-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mandan were cautiously favorable toward such an alliance. When the Expedition returned to the area in 1806 while traveling east, the Mandan sent one of their chiefs, ''[[Sheheke]],'' on the trip to [[Washington, D.C.]] to meet with Thomas Jefferson.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Potter, ''Sheheke: Mandan Indian Diplomat'' (Farcountry Press, 2003), 104 and 115.&lt;/ref&gt; But the Mandan did not commit to trading with the United States at the expense of their previous partnership with Great Britain through Canadian traders.&lt;ref&gt;Rhonda (1984), ''Lewis and Clark among the Indians'', p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hidatsa strongly resisted the American diplomatic efforts, often avoiding meeting with Lewis and Clark.&lt;ref&gt;Rhonda (1984), ''Lewis and Clark among the Indians'', pp. 90-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparations for spring travel==
The Corps spent much time during the winter to prepare for their travel in the spring, repairing equipment, making clothing, processing dried meats, etc. In addition, on the way to their winter site, they had used maps made by previous explorers. From that point on in their westward journey, they would enter territory unfamiliar to Europeans according to known documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Clay S. Jenkinson, ''The Character of Meriwether Lewis: Explorer in the Wilderness'' (Dakota Institute Press, 2011), 13 and 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Clark noted that he gathered information from chief [[Sheheke]] about the route to the west in order to make a preliminary map.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/read/?_xmlsrc=1805-01-07&amp;_xslsrc=LCstyles.xsl ''Lewis and Clark Journals'', 7 January 1805], University of Nebraska Lincoln&lt;/ref&gt;

Not knowing if they would survive the journey, Lewis and Clark used the winter to compile their descriptions of [[tributaries]] of the Missouri River, their observations about the Native nations encountered, and their descriptions of plant and mineral specimens which they had collected; all were compiled into a manuscript which they called the ''Mandan Miscellany''. In the spring the captains sent a copy of the manuscript to government officials in St. Louis via their large [[keelboat]].&lt;ref name="jenkinson"&gt;Clay S. Jenkinson, ed, ''A Vast and Open Plain: The Writings of the Lewis and Clark Expedition in North Dakota, 1804-1806 (Bismarck: State Historical Society of North Dakota, 2003), pp. 437-439&lt;/ref&gt;  The boat would return before their expected arrival at the Mandan area in 1806.

==Sacagawea==
Lewis and Clark appear to have first met [[Sacagawea]] at Fort Mandan.&lt;ref name="jenkinson"/&gt; Her husband [[Toussaint Charbonneau]] served as a Hidatsa interpreter for the expedition, and the journals imply that she lived at the fort with him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/read/?_xmlsrc=1805-02-07&amp;_xslsrc=LCstyles.xsl ''Lewis and Clark Journals'', 7 February 1805], University of Nebraska Lincoln&lt;/ref&gt; Their son [[Jean Baptiste Charbonneau]], whom she kept with her throughout the expedition, was born on February 11, possibly at the fort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/read/?_xmlsrc=1805-02-11&amp;_xslsrc=LCstyles.xsl ''Lewis and Clark Journals'', 11 February 1805], University of Nebraska Lincoln&lt;/ref&gt;

==1806 and after==
When the Corps passed back through the area in August 1806 on their return journey to the East, they found the fort had burnt to the ground. The cause is unknown. Since that time, the [[Missouri River]] has slowly eroded the bank and shifted course to the east, putting the former site of the fort underwater.&lt;ref name="fortmandan"/&gt;

The Lewis and Clark Fort Mandan Foundation built a replica of the fort along the river, 2.5 miles from the intersection of ND 200A and [[US 83]]. Made according to materials and design as described in the expedition's journals, it is located near the [[North Dakota Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center]]. The fort replica holds reproduction items, such as "Meriwether Lewis' field desk, William Clark's map-making tools, bunks the men slept in, equipment they carried in the field, clothes they wore, and the blacksmith's forge."&lt;ref name="fortmandan"/&gt; In addition, the site has personnel for tours and interpretive programs about the Lewis and Clark Expedition and its significance in United States, state and regional history. Walking trails go along the property and the river.&lt;ref name="fortmandan"&gt;[http://www.fortmandan.com/plan/ Lewis and Clark Fort Mandan Foundation], official website&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7385">In [[mathematics]], the '''Gauss circle problem''' is the problem of determining how many [[integer lattice]] points there are in a [[circle]] centered at the origin and with [[radius]] ''r''.  This number is approximated by the area of the circle, so the real problem is to accurately bound the [[error term]] describing how the number of points differs from the area.
The first progress on a solution was made by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], hence its name.

==The problem==

Consider a circle in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with center at the origin and radius ''r''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0.  Gauss' circle problem asks how many points there are inside this circle of the form (''m'',''n'') where ''m'' and ''n'' are both integers.  Since the [[equation]] of this circle is given in [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] by ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;, the question is equivalently asking how many pairs of integers ''m'' and ''n'' there are such that
:&lt;math&gt;m^2+n^2\leq r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

If the answer for a given ''r'' is denoted by ''N''(''r'') then the following list shows the first few values of ''N''(''r'') for ''r'' an integer between 0 and 12 followed by the list of values &lt;math&gt; \pi r^2 &lt;/math&gt; rounded to the nearest integer:
:1, 5, 13, 29, 49, 81, 113, 149, 197, 253, 317, 377, 441 {{OEIS|id=A000328}} 
:0, 3, 13, 28, 50, 79, 113, 154, 201, 254, 314, 380, 452 {{OEIS|id=A075726}}

==Bounds on a solution and conjecture==
N(r) is roughly π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[Area of a disk|area inside a circle]] of radius ''r''. This is because on average, each unit square contains one lattice point. Thus, the actual number of lattice points in the circle is approximately equal to its area, π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  So it should be expected that
:&lt;math&gt;N(r)=\pi r^2 +E(r)\,&lt;/math&gt;
for some error term ''E''(''r'') of relatively small absolute value.   Finding a correct upper bound for |''E''(''r'')| is thus the form the problem has taken. Note that ''r'' need not be an integer. After  &lt;math&gt;N(4)=49 &lt;/math&gt;   one has &lt;math&gt;N(\sqrt{17})=57 ,N(\sqrt{18})=61, N(\sqrt{20})=69, N(5)=81 .&lt;/math&gt; At these places &lt;math&gt; E(r)&lt;/math&gt; increases by &lt;math&gt;8,4,8,12&lt;/math&gt; after which it decreases (at a rate of &lt;math&gt; 2 \pi r &lt;/math&gt;) until the next time it increases.

Gauss managed to prove&lt;ref name="Hardy"&gt;G.H. Hardy, ''Ramanujan: Twelve Lectures on Subjects Suggested by His Life and Work, 3rd ed.'' New York: Chelsea, (1999), p.67.&lt;/ref&gt; that
:&lt;math&gt;| E(r) |\leq 2\sqrt{2}\pi r.&lt;/math&gt;
[[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]]&lt;ref&gt;G.H. Hardy, ''On the Expression of a Number as the Sum of Two Squares'', Quart. J. Math. '''46''', (1915), pp.263&amp;ndash;283.&lt;/ref&gt; and, independently, [[Edmund Landau|Landau]] found a lower bound by showing that
:&lt;math&gt;| E(r) |\neq o\left(r^{1/2}(\log r)^{1/4}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
using the [[Big O notation#Little-o notation|little o-notation]].  It is conjectured&lt;ref name="Guy"&gt;R.K. Guy, ''Unsolved problems in number theory, Third edition'', Springer, (2004), pp.365&amp;ndash;366.&lt;/ref&gt; that the correct bound is
:&lt;math&gt;| E(r) |=O\left(r^{1/2+\varepsilon}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Writing |''E''(''r'')|&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''Cr''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;, the current bounds on ''t'' are
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt; t\leq\frac{131}{208}=0.6298\ldots,&lt;/math&gt;
with the lower bound from Hardy and Landau in 1915, and the upper bound proved by [[Martin Huxley|Huxley]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;M.N. Huxley, ''Integer points, exponential sums and the Riemann zeta function'', Number theory for the millennium, II (Urbana, IL, 2000) pp.275&amp;ndash;290, A K Peters, Natick, MA, 2002, {{MR|1956254}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exact forms==

The value of ''N''(''r'') can be given by several series.  In terms of a sum involving the [[floor function]] it can be expressed as:&lt;ref&gt;D. Hilbert and S. Cohn-Vossen, ''Geometry and the Imagination'', New York: Chelsea, (1999), pp.37&amp;ndash;38.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;N(r)=1+4\sum_{i=0}^\infty \left(\left\lfloor\frac{r^2}{4i+1}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{r^2}{4i+3}\right\rfloor\right).&lt;/math&gt;

This is a consequence of Jacobi's two-square theorem, which follows almost immediately from the [[Jacobi triple product]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hirschhorn|first=Michael D.|date=2000|title=Partial Fractions and Four Classical Theorems of Number Theory|jstor=2589321|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|volume=107|issue=3|pages=260–264|doi=10.2307/2589321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A much simpler sum appears if the [[sum of squares function]] ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') is defined as the number of ways of writing the number ''n'' as the sum of two squares.  Then&lt;ref name="Hardy" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;N(r)=\sum_{n=0}^{r^2} r_2(n).&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalisations==

Although the original problem asks for integer lattice points in a circle, there is no reason not to consider other shapes, for example [[conics]]; indeed [[Dirichlet's divisor problem#Dirichlet's divisor problem|Dirichlet's divisor problem]] is the equivalent problem where the circle is replaced by the rectangular [[hyperbola]].&lt;ref name="Guy"/&gt;  Similarly one could extend the question from two dimensions to higher dimensions, and ask for integer points within a [[N-sphere|sphere]] or other objects. There is an extensive literature on these problems. If one ignores the geometry and merely considers the problem an algebraic one of [[Diophantine approximation|Diophantine inequalities]] then there one could increase the exponents appearing in the problem from squares to cubes, or higher.

===The primitive circle problem===

Another generalisation is to calculate the number of [[coprime]] integer solutions ''m'', ''n'' to the inequality
:&lt;math&gt;m^2+n^2\leq r^2.\,&lt;/math&gt;
This problem is known as the '''primitive circle problem''', as it involves searching for primitive solutions to the original circle problem.&lt;ref name="jw02"&gt;J. Wu, ''On the primitive circle problem'', Monatsh. Math. '''135''' (2002), pp.69&amp;ndash;81.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be intuitively understood as the question of how many trees within a distance of r are visible in the [[Euclid's orchard]], standing in the origin. If the number of such solutions is denoted ''V''(''r'') then the values of ''V''(''r'') for ''r'' taking small integer values are 
:0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 48, 72, 88, 120, 152, 192 … {{OEIS|A175341}}.
Using the same ideas as the usual Gauss circle problem and the fact that the [[Coprime#Probabilities|probability that two integers are coprime]] is 6/''π''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it is relatively straightforward to show that
:&lt;math&gt;V(r)=\frac{6}{\pi}r^2+O(r^{1+\varepsilon}).&lt;/math&gt;
As with the usual circle problem, the problematic part of the primitive circle problem is reducing the exponent in the error term. At present the best known exponent is 221/304&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ε'' if one assumes the [[Riemann hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="jw02" /&gt; Without assuming the Riemann hypothesis, the best known upper bound is
:&lt;math&gt;V(r)=\frac{6}{\pi}r^2+O(r\exp(-c(\log r)^{3/5}(\log\log r^2)^{-1/5}))&lt;/math&gt;
for a positive constant ''c''.&lt;ref name="jw02" /&gt; In particular, no bound on the error term of the form 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''ε'' for any ''ε''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 is currently known that does not assume the Riemann Hypothesis.

'''Georg Heinrich Patrick Baron von Tiesenhausen''' (May 18, 1914&amp;nbsp;– June 4, 2018)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2018/06/dr_georg_von_tiesenhausen_last.html Dr. Georg von Tiesenhausen, last of German rocket team, dies in Alabama], al.com; accessed June 10, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[United States]]-based [[German people|German]] [[Aerospace engineering|rocket scientist]]. &lt;!--any evidence he became US citizen? --&gt;

After being brought to the United States in 1953 as part of [[Operation Paperclip]], he was part of [[Wernher von Braun]]'s team at the [[United States Army]], and later, [[NASA]]. He is credited with the first complete design of the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] and made a variety of other contributions to the space program. He was a member of [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] noble family of [[Tiesenhausen]].

==Early years==
Tiesenhausen was born in [[Riga|Riga, Latvia]], in the [[Russian Empire]]&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;[http://obits.al.com/obituaries/huntsville/obituary.aspx?n=georg-h-p-baron-von-tiesenhausen&amp;pid=189241030&amp;fhid=23833 Georg H. P. Baron von Tiesenhausen], al.com; accessed June 19, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; to a Baltic German family from his father's side, while his mother was of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] ancestry. He studied engineering in [[Hamburg]], but was conscripted to the [[Luftwaffe]] in 1939 and sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. He was allowed to continue his studies and in 1943 and graduated from [[University of Hamburg]]. After his graduation he was sent to the [[Peenemünde Army Research Center]].&lt;ref name="ushmm"&gt;[https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn48105 Oral history interview with Georg von Tiesenhausen]  December 16, 1988.

==Career==
Tiesenhausen worked with [[Wernher von Braun]] developing V-2 rockets in Germany during World War II. He came to America in 1953 as part of [[Operation Paperclip]], where he again worked with von Braun on guided missiles such as the [[Redstone (rocket family)|Redstone]], this time for the United States Army at [[Redstone Arsenal]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. He was later transferred to NASA, where he worked on various spaceflight programs, including the [[Apollo program]], which landed men on the [[Moon]].&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/19881129_georg_von_tiesenhausen.pdf MSFC History Project Georg Von Tiesenhausen conducted by A.

He continued to work for NASA well into the [[Space Shuttle|Shuttle]] era.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2018/06/05/georg-von-tiesenhausen-rocket-scientist-obituary Georg von Tiesenhausen, rocket scientist – obituary], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', June 5, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="video"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwrAl0gLuaI George von Tiesenhausen], Youtube.com interview by Dr. Donald Tarter on January 1, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Later he worked on [[space tether missions]].&lt;ref name="nasa"/&gt;

==After NASA==
Between 1987 and 2010, von Tiesenhausen frequently volunteered at the [[U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], lecturing to students in [[United States Space Camp|Space Camp]] programs about the future of space exploration and other topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rzbt.haw-hamburg.de/dankert/Absolventen/Absolventen-Jahrgang_1943/Georg_von_Tiesenhausen/georg_von_tiesenhausen.html]|title=Georg von Tiesenhausen|accessdate=June 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;u=http://www.haw-hamburg.de/rzbt/dankert/Absolventen/Absolventen-Jahrgang_1943/Georg_von_Tiesenhausen/georg_von_tiesenhausen.html&amp;ei=fS3ZScviL5KeMq_k_eoO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search?q=%2522georg+von+tiesenhausen%2522&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;start=10|title=Google Translate|website=Translate.google.com|accessdate=June 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HMS ''Protector''''' is a Royal Navy ice patrol ship built in Norway in 2001. As '''MV ''Polarbjørn''''' (Norwegian: ''[[polar bear]]'') she operated under charter as a polar research [[icebreaker]] and a subsea support vessel. In 2011, she was chartered as a temporary replacement for the ice patrol ship {{HMS|Endurance|A171|6}} and was purchased outright by the British [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] in September 2013.

==Service history (Norway)==
An earlier icebreaker ''Polarbjørn'' was bought by [[Greenpeace]] in 1995 and renamed {{MV|Arctic Sunrise}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://philateliemarine.chez.com/phil_mar_e/TAAF_e.htm| title=Ships of the French Southern and Antarctic Territories| publisher=Philateliemarine| accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Polarbjørn'' was designed and built for long Antarctic expeditions and for supporting subsea work.&lt;ref name="rieber"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rieber-shipping.no/?page=69&amp;show=364| title=Polarbjørn| publisher=GC Rieber Shipping| accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Polarbjørn'' was equipped to [[dynamic positioning|DP2 class]]&lt;ref name="rieber"/&gt; and had accommodation for 100. Large cargo holds and open deck areas provide storage capacity for [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROVs]] and related equipment. A 50-ton knuckle-boom crane and the 25-ton stern A-frame allow equipment to be deployed over the side and over the stern.

''Polarbjørn'' worked in the "spot" market, on short-term charter. During 2009, the vessel was chartered for [[Exploration geophysics|electromagnetic survey]] work in the [[North Sea]], [[Norwegian Sea]] and [[Barents Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.scandoil.com/moxie-bm2/news/spot_news/gc-rieber-subsea-ship-orders-mark-acceptance.shtml| title=GC Rieber subsea ship orders mark "acceptance"| date=16 January 2009| publisher=Scandinavian Oil-Gas Online| accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.discoverpetroleum.com/int/news-archive/petromarker-electromagnetic-em-campaign| title=PetroMarker electromagnetic (EM) campaign| date=20 July 2009| publisher=Discover Petroleum| accessdate=27 February 2011| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710132604/http://www.discoverpetroleum.com/int/news-archive/petromarker-electromagnetic-em-campaign| archivedate=10 July 2011| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was exposed to a downturn in business during 2010, with only a 33% utilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://presentator.s3.amazonaws.com/gcrieber/6386fe00838a4fe99b66a581fd9b26a1/view.html| title=Fourth Quarter 2010 Presentation| format=webcast| publisher=GC Rieber Shipping ASA| accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the Royal Navy charter, she underwent a ten-day refit in [[Odense]], Denmark. The [[helicopter deck]], originally above her bridge, was repositioned over the stern and a [[multibeam echosounder]] for survey work was installed. Her engines and gearboxes were overhauled and she was modified to allow the carriage of the ancillary vessels and vehicles (survey boats, all-terrain vehicles) used in support of the [[British Antarctic Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thinkdefence.co.uk/2011/05/hms-protector-ready/| title=HMS ''Protector'' ready| publisher=Think Defence| date=26 May 2011| accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, after receiving a distress call from [[Comandante Ferraz Antarctic Station]] on [[King George Island (South Shetland Islands)|King George Island]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]], ''Protector'' sailed to provide assistance to the [[Brazil]]ian research station after a large fire had broken out there. 23 of her sailors were put ashore with fire-fighting equipment to tackle the blaze.

[[File:HMS Protector in Antarctica.jpg|thumb|left|On her first Antarctic deployment, March 2012]]
During March and April 2012, the ship operated in the vicinity of [[Rothera Research Station]]. During a major visit, she delivered around 170 cubic metres of aviation fuel. At 67° 34&amp;prime; S, this was the most southerly visit of her career up to that date, nearly {{convert|800|mi}} from [[Cape Horn]], the southernmost tip of the South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/defenceimages/7136065341| title=The Ship's Company of HMS Protector at Rothera, Antarctica| publisher=Flickr| author=[https://www.flickr.com/photos/defenceimages/ UK Ministry of Defence]| accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew competed in a 'winter Olympics' with scientists from the [[British Antarctic Survey]].

On the way to her second Antarctic deployment, in October 2012 ''Protector'' surveyed the wreck of the [[Dale-class oiler]] [[RFA Darkdale|RFA ''Darkdale]] in James Bay, [[Saint Helena]], as part of an assessment of its possible threat to the island's environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.maritimejournal.com/news101/industry-news/hms-protector-surveys-wartime-wreck |title=HMS Protector surveys wartime wreck |date=22 October 2012 |work=Maritime Journal |accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On arriving in Antarctica in December, her designated Antarctic Treaty Observers supported an international team carrying out inspections of research stations to ensure compliance with the Antarctic Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.shippingtimes.co.uk/item_10401.html |title=HMS Protector Arrives in the Antarctic |date=16 December 2012 |work=Shipping Times |accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship left for her third Antarctic deployment in October 2013.

In November 2017, following a request for assistance from the [[Argentine government]], ''Protector'' was redeployed to aid international efforts to locate the missing submarine {{ship|ARA|San Juan|S-42|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2017/november/19/171118-protector-assists-submarine-search|title=HMS Protector arrives in South Atlantic to join search efforts for missing Argentine submarine |publisher=Royal Navy |date=19 November 2017 |accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embarked equipment==
''Protector'' operates several small boats, including the [[survey motor boat]] ''James Caird IV'', the ramped work boat ''Terra Nova'' and two Pacific 22 [[RHIB|RIB]]s ''Nimrod'' and ''Aurora''. She also embarks three [[Bandvagn 206|BV206]] all-terrain vehicles and a number of quad-bikes and trailers for activities on Antarctica, such as moving stores and equipment.&lt;ref name="Steve Bush 2014"/&gt;

''James Caird IV'' is a {{convert|10.5|m|adj=on}}, ice-capable survey motor boat built by Mustang Marine in [[Pembroke Dockyard]], based on a design of existing British Antarctic Survey boats.

The term '''halothermal circulation''' refers to the part of the large-scale ocean circulation that is driven by global [[density gradient]]s created by surface heat and evaporation.

The adjective halothermal derives from ''[[salinity|halo-]]'' referring to salt content and ''[[wikt:thermo-|-thermal]]'' referring to temperature, factors which together determine the [[Water (molecule)#Density of saltwater and ice|density of sea water]]. Halothermal circulation is driven primarily by salinity changes and secondarily by temperature changes (as opposed to the [[Thermohaline circulation|thermohaline]] mode in modern oceans). The generation of high salinity surface waters at low latitudes, which were therefore of higher density and thus sank, is thought to have been the dominant ocean circulation driver during [[Greenhouse and icehouse Earth|greenhouse climate]]s such as the [[Cretaceous]]. Similar dynamics operate today in the [[Mediterranean]].

The formation of bottom waters by halothermal dynamics is considered to be one to two orders of magnitude weaker than in thermohaline systems.

The '''history of anthropometry''' includes the use of [[anthropometry]] as an early tool of [[biological anthropology|physical anthropology]], use for identification, use for the purposes of understanding human physical [[Human genetic variation|variation]], in [[paleoanthropology]], and in various attempts to correlate physical with racial and psychological traits. At various points in history, certain anthropometrics have been cited by advocates of [[discrimination]] and [[eugenics]], often as part of novel [[social movement]]s or based upon [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific claims]].

==Craniometry and paleoanthropology==
{{Further information|Paleoanthropology|biological anthropology}}
[[File:Primate skull series with legend cropped.png|right|250px|thumb|Selection of [[Primate]] skulls.]]
In 1716 [[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton]], who wrote many essays on [[comparative anatomy]] for the [[Académie française]], published his ''Memoir on the Different Positions of the [[Foramina of the skull#List of foramina|Occipital Foramen]] in Man and Animals'' (''Mémoire sur les différences de la situation du grand trou occipital dans l’homme et dans les animaux''). Six years later [[Pieter Camper]] (1722–1789), distinguished both as an artist and as an anatomist, published some lectures that laid the foundation of much work. Camper invented the "[[facial angle]]," a measure meant to determine [[animal intelligence|intelligence]] among various species. According to this technique, a "facial angle" was formed by drawing two lines: one horizontally from the [[nostril]] to the [[ear]]; and the other perpendicularly from the advancing part of the upper [[Human jawbone|jawbone]] to the most prominent part of the [[forehead]]. Camper's measurements of facial angle were first made to compare the skulls of men with those of other animals. Camper claimed that antique statues presented an angle of 90°, Europeans of 80°, Central Africans of 70° and the orangutan of 58°.

Swedish professor of anatomy [[Anders Retzius]] (1796–1860) first used the [[cephalic index]] in [[physical anthropology]] to classify ancient human remains found in Europe. He classed skulls in three main categories; "dolichocephalic" (from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''kephalê'', head, and ''dolikhos'', long and thin), "brachycephalic" (short and broad) and "mesocephalic" (intermediate length and width).  Scientific research was continued by [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] (1772–1844) and [[Paul Broca]] (1824–1880), founder of the Anthropological Society in France in 1859. Paleoanthropologists still rely upon craniofacial anthropometry to identify species in the study of fossilized hominid bones. Specimens of ''Homo erectus'' and athletic specimens of ''Homo sapiens'', for example, are virtually identical from the neck down but their skulls can easily be told apart.
[[File:Huxley - Mans Place in Nature.jpg|thumb|left|280px|''Pithecometra'': In the frontispiece from his 1863 ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]'', [[Thomas Huxley]] compared skeletons of apes to humans.]]
[[Samuel George Morton]] (1799–1851), whose two major monographs were the ''Crania Americana'' (1839), ''An Inquiry into the Distinctive Characteristics of the Aboriginal Race of America'' and ''Crania Aegyptiaca'' (1844) concluded that the [[ancient Egyptians]] were not Negroid but Caucasoid and that Caucasians and Negroes were already distinct three thousand years ago. Since ''The Bible'' indicated that [[Noah's Ark]] had washed up on [[Mount Ararat]] only a thousand years before this Noah's sons could not account for every race on earth. According to Morton's theory of [[polygenism]] the races had been separate from the start.&lt;ref name="David Hurst Thomas 2001, pp. 38 - 41"&gt;[[David Hurst Thomas]], ''Skull Wars: Kennewick Man, Archaeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity'', 2001, pp. 38–41&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josiah C. Nott]] and [[George Gliddon]] carried Morton's ideas further.&lt;ref&gt;Josiah C. Nott and George Gliddon, ''Types of Mankind'' (1854)&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Darwin, who thought the [[single-origin hypothesis]] essential to [[evolutionary theory]], opposed Nott and Gliddon in his 1871 ''[[The Descent of Man]]'', arguing for [[monogenism]].

In 1856, workers found in a limestone quarry the skull of a [[Neanderthal]] hominid male, thinking it to be the remains of a bear. They gave the material to amateur naturalist [[Johann Karl Fuhlrott]] who turned the fossils over to anatomist [[Hermann Schaaffhausen]]. The discovery was jointly announced in 1857, giving rise to the discipline of [[paleoanthropology]]. By comparing skeletons of apes to man, [[T. H. Huxley]] (1825–1895) backed up [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]], first expressed in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859). He also developed the "[[Pithecometra principle]]," which stated that man and ape were descended from a common ancestor.

[[Eugène Dubois]]' (1858–1940) discovery in 1891 in Indonesia of the "[[Java Man]]", the first specimen of [[Homo erectus]] to be discovered, demonstrated mankind's deep ancestry outside Europe. [[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834–1919) became famous for his "[[recapitulation theory]]", according to which each individual mirrors the evolution of the whole species during his life.

[[Samuel George Morton]] (1799–1851) collected hundreds of human skulls from all over the world and started trying to find a way to classify them according to some logical criterion. Morton claimed that he could judge intellectual capacity by [[cranial capacity]]. A large skull meant a large [[Human brain|brain]] and high intellectual capacity, a small skull indicated a small brain and decreased intellectual capacity. Modern science has since confirmed that there is a correlation between cranium size (measured in various ways) and intelligence as measured by IQ tests, although it is a weak correlation at about 0.2. Today, brain volume as measured with MRI scanners also find a correlation between brain size and intelligence at about 0.4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rushton|first=J. Philippe|author2=Ankney, C. Davison|title=Whole Brain Size and General Mental Ability: A Review|journal=International Journal of Neuroscience|date=1 January 2009|volume=119|issue=5|pages=692–732|doi=10.1080/00207450802325843|pmid=19283594|pmc=2668913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Craniometry]] was also used in [[phrenology]], which purported to determine character, personality traits, and criminality on the basis of the shape of the head. At the turn of the 19th century, [[Franz Joseph Gall]] (1758–1822) developed "cranioscopy" (Ancient Greek ''kranion'' - "skull", ''scopos'' - "vision"), a method to determine the personality and development of mental and moral faculties on the basis of the external shape of the skull. Cranioscopy was later renamed phrenology (''phrenos'': mind, ''logos'': study) by his student [[Johann Spurzheim]] (1776–1832), who wrote extensively on "Drs. Gall and Spurzheim's [[physiognomy|physiognomical]] System." These all claimed the ability to predict traits or intelligence and were intensively practised in the 19th and the first part of the 20th century.

During the 1940s anthropometry was used by [[William Herbert Sheldon|William Sheldon]] when evaluating his [[somatotype and constitutional psychology|somatotype]]s, according to which characteristics of the body can be translated into characteristics of the mind. Inspired by [[Cesare Lombroso]]'s [[criminal anthropology]], he also believed that [[criminality]] could be predicted according to the body type.  A basically anthropometric division of [[constitution type|body type]]s into the categories [[endomorphism|endomorphic]], [[ectomorphic]] and [[mesomorphic]] derived from Sheldon's [[somatotype and constitutional psychology|somatotype]] theories is today popular among people doing [[weight training]].

==Forensic anthropometry==

===Bertillon, Galton and criminology===
[[File:The speaking portrait.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Illustration from "The Speaking Portrait" (Pearson's Magazine, Vol XI, January to June 1901) demonstrating the principles of Bertillon's anthropometry.]]
In 1883, Frenchman [[Alphonse Bertillon]] introduced a system of [[Body identification|identification]] that was named after him.  The "Bertillonage" system was based on the finding that several measures of physical features, such as the dimensions of bony structures in the body, that remain fairly constant throughout adult life. Bertillon concluded that when these measurements were made and recorded systematically, every individual would be distinguishable.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Anthropometry|volume=2|pages=119-120}} This cites as authorities:

* ''Report of Home Office Committee on the Best Means of Identifying Habitual Criminals'' (1893–1894)&lt;/ref&gt; Bertillon's goal was a way of identifying [[recidivism|recidivists]] ("repeat offenders"). Previously police could only record general descriptions. Photography of criminals had become commonplace, but there was no easy way to sort the many thousands of photographs except by name. Bertillon's hope was that, through the use of measurements, a set of identifying numbers could be entered into a filing system installed in a single cabinet.
[[File:Galton at Bertillon's (1893).jpg|left|thumb|180px|A Bertillon record for [[Francis Galton]], from a visit to Bertillon's laboratory in 1893.]]
The system involved 10 measurements; ''height'', ''stretch'' (distance from left [[shoulder]] to [[middle finger]] of raised right  arm), ''bust'' ([[torso]] from head to seat when seated), ''head length'' (crown to forehead) and ''head width'' temple to temple) ''width'' of [[cheeks]], and "lengths" of the ''right [[ear]]'', the ''left [[foot]], [[middle finger]]'', and ''[[cubit]]'' (elbow to tip of middle finger). It was possible, by exhaustion, to sort the cards on which these details were recorded (together with a photograph) until a small number produced the measurements of the individual sought, independently of name.
[[File:Bertillon - Signalement Anthropometrique.png|thumb|right|250px|A chart from Bertillon's ''Identification anthropométrique'' (1893), demonstrating how to take measurements for his identification system.]]
The system was soon adapted to police methods: it prevented impersonation and could demonstrate wrongdoing.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Bertillonage was before long represented in Paris by a collection of some 100,000 cards and became popular in several other countries' justice systems. England followed suit when in 1894, a committee sent to Paris to investigate the methods and its results reported favorably on the use of measurements for primary classification and recommended also the partial adoption of the system of [[finger print]]s suggested by [[Francis Galton]], then in use in [[Bengal]], where measurements were abandoned in 1897 after the fingerprint system was adopted throughout British India. Three years later England followed suit, and, as the result of a fresh inquiry ordered by the Home Office, relied upon fingerprints alone.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Bertillonage exhibited certain defects and was gradually supplanted by the system of [[fingerprint]]s and, latterly, [[genetics]]. Bertillon originally measured variables he thought were independent - such as forearm length and leg length - but Galton had realized that both were the result of a single causal variable (in this case, stature) and  developed the statistical concept of [[correlation]].

Other complications were: it was difficult to tell whether or not individuals arrested were first-time offenders; instruments employed were costly and liable to break down; skilled measurers were needed; errors were frequent and all but irremediable; and it was necessary to repeat measurements three times to arrive at a mean result.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===Physiognomy===
{{Main article|Physiognomy}}
Physiognomy claimed a correlation between physical features (especially facial features) and character traits. It was made famous by [[Cesare Lombroso]] (1835–1909), the founder of [[anthropological criminology]], who claimed to be able to scientifically identify links between the nature of a crime and the personality or physical appearance of the offender. The originator of the concept of a "[[born criminal]]" and arguing in favor of [[biological determinism]], Lombroso tried to recognize criminals by measurements of their bodies. He concluded that skull and facial features were clues to genetic criminality and that these features could be measured with craniometers and calipers with the results developed into quantitative research. A few of the 14 identified traits of a criminal included large [[jaw]]s, forward projection of jaw, low sloping forehead; high [[cheekbone]]s, flattened or upturned nose; handle-shaped [[ear]]s; hawk-like [[Human nose|nose]]s or fleshy [[lip]]s; hard shifty eyes; scanty beard or baldness; insensitivity to pain; long arms, and so on.

{{Main article|Phylogeography}}
[[File:Anthropometry exhibit.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Anthropometry demonstrated in an exhibit from a 1921 [[eugenics]] conference.]]
Phylogeography is the science of identifying and tracking major [[human migrations]], especially in prehistoric times. Linguistics can follow the movement of languages and archaeology can follow the movement of artefact styles but neither can tell whether a culture's spread was due to a source population's physically migrating or to a destination population's simply copying the technology and learning the language. Anthropometry was used extensively by anthropologists studying human and racial origins: some attempted racial differentiation and [[Race (classification of human beings)|classification]], often seeking ways in which certain races were inferior to others.&lt;ref&gt;"From Savage to Negro" (1998) Lee D. Baker p.14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Mismeasure of Man" Stephen Jay Gould (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; Nott translated [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853–1855), a founding work of racial segregationism that made three main divisions between races, based not on colour but on climatic conditions and geographic location, and privileged the "Aryan" race.   Science has tested many theories aligning race and personality, which have been current since [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]] (1658–1722)  contrasted the ''[[French people|Français]]'' (French people), alleged descendants of the Nordic [[Franks]], and members of the [[aristocracy]], to the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]], considered to be indigenous [[Gallo-Roman]] people subordinated by [[right of conquest]].

[[François Bernier]], [[Carl Linnaeus]] and Blumenbach had examined multiple observable human characteristics in search of a typology. Bernier based his racial classification on physical type which included hair shape, nose shape and skin color. Linnaeus based a similar racial classification scheme. As anthropologists gained access to methods of skull measure they developed racial classification based on skull shape.

Theories of [[scientific racism]] became popular, one prominent figure being [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] (1854–1936), who in ''L'Aryen et son rôle social'' (1899 - "The [[Aryan]] and his social role") divided [[human race|humanity]] into various, hierarchized, different " [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]]", spanning from the "[[Aryan]] white race, dolichocephalic" to the "brachycephalic" (short and broad-headed) race. Between these Vacher de Lapouge identified the "''[[Nordic theory|Homo europaeus]]'' (Teutonic, Protestant, etc.), the "''[[Homo alpinus]]''" ([[Auvergne (province)|Auvergnat]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], etc.) and the "''[[Homo mediterraneus]]''" ([[Naples|Napolitano]], [[Andalusia|Andalus]], etc.). "Homo africanus" (Congo, Florida) was excluded from discussion. His racial classification ("Teutonic", "Alpine" and "Mediterranean") was also used by [[William Z. Ripley]] (1867–1941) who, in ''[[The Races of Europe (Ripley)|The Races of Europe]]'' (1899), made a map of [[Europe]] according to the cephalic index of its inhabitants.

Vacher de Lapouge became one of the leading inspirations of [[Nazi]] [[anti-semitism]] and [[Nazi policies|Nazi ideology]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Pierre-André Taguieff]], ''La couleur et le sang - Doctrines racistes à la française'' ("Colour and Blood - doctrines ''à la française''"), Paris, [[Mille et une nuits]], 2002, 203 pages, and ''La Force du préjugé - Essai sur le racisme et ses doubles'', Tel [[Gallimard]], La Découverte, 1987, 644 pages&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nazi Germany]] relied on anthropometric measurements to distinguish [[Aryan]]s from [[Jew]]s and many forms of anthropometry were used for the advocacy of [[eugenics]]. During the 1920s and 1930s, though, members of the school of [[cultural anthropology]] of [[Franz Boas]] began to use anthropometric approaches to discredit the concept of fixed biological race.  Boas used the cephalic index to show the influence of environmental factors. Researches on skulls and skeletons eventually helped liberate 19th century European science from its [[ethnocentric]] bias.&lt;ref name=HuxAI&gt;"Cultural Biases Reflected in the Hominid Fossil Record" (history), by Joshua Barbach and Craig Byron, 2005, ''ArchaeologyInfo.com'' webpage: [http://www.archaeologyinfo.com/perspectives003.htm ArchaeologyInfo-003].&lt;/ref&gt; This school of physical anthropology generally went into decline during the 1940s.

===Race and brain size===
Several studies have demonstrated correlations between race and brain size, with varying results. In some studies, Caucasians were reported to have larger brains than other racial groups, whereas in recent studies and reanalysis of previous studies, East Asians were reported as having larger brains and skulls. More common among the studies was the report that Africans had smaller skulls than either Caucasians or East Asians. Criticisms have been raised against a number of these studies regarding questionable methods.

[[File:Morton drawing.png|right|thumb|200px|An 1839 drawing by [[Samuel George Morton]] of "a Negro head… a Caucasian skull… a Mongol head."]]
In ''Crania Americana'' Morton claimed that Caucasians had the biggest brains, averaging 87 cubic inches, Indians were in the middle with an average of 82 cubic inches and Negroes had the smallest brains with an average of 78 cubic inches.&lt;ref name="David Hurst Thomas 2001, pp. 38 - 41"/&gt; In 1873 [[Paul Broca]] (1824–1880) found the same pattern described by Samuel Morton's ''Crania Americana'' by weighing brains at [[autopsy]]. Other historical studies alleging a Black-White difference in brain size include Bean (1906), Mall, (1909), Pearl, (1934) and Vint (1934). But in Germany [[Rudolf Virchow]]'s study led him to denounce "[[Nordic theory|Nordic mysticism]]" in the 1885 Anthropology Congress in [[Karlsruhe]]. [[Josef Kollmann]], a collaborator of Virchow, stated in the same congress that the people of Europe, be them German, Italian, English or French, belonged to a "mixture of various races," furthermore declaring that the "results of craniology" led to "struggle against any theory concerning the superiority of this or that European race".&lt;ref name=Orsucci&gt;Andrea Orsucci, "[http://www.unifi.it/riviste/cromohs/3_98/orsucci.html Ariani, indogermani, stirpi mediterranee: aspetti del dibattito sulle razze europee (1870-1914)] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121218231754/http://www.unifi.it/riviste/cromohs/3_98/orsucci.html |date=2012-12-18 }}, ''[[Cromohs]]'', 1998 {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virchow later rejected measure of skulls as legitimate means of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]. [[Paul Kretschmer]] quoted an 1892 discussion with him concerning these criticisms, also citing [[Aurel von Törok]]'s 1895 work, who basically proclaimed the failure of craniometry.&lt;ref name=Orsucci/&gt;

Stephen Jay Gould (1941–2002) claimed Samuel Morton had fudged data and "overpacked" the skulls.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Jay Gould, ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'', (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent study by John Michael concluded that "[c]ontrary to Gould's interpretation...

They identified and remeasured half of the skulls used in Morton’s reports, finding that in only 2% of cases did Morton’s measurements differ significantly from their own and that these errors either were random or gave a larger than accurate volume to African skulls, the reverse of the bias that Dr. Gould imputed to Morton.&lt;ref name="jelewis"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lewis Jason E. |author2=DeGusta D. |author3=Meyer M.R. |author4=Monge J.M. |author5=Mann A.E. | year = 2011 | title = The Mismeasure of Science: Stephen Jay Gould versus Samuel George Morton on Skulls and Bias | journal = PLoS Biol | volume = 9 | issue = 6| page = e1001071 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001071 |display-authors=etal | pmid=21666803 | pmc=3110184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Difference in brain size, however, does not necessarily imply differences in intelligence: women tend to have smaller brains than men yet have more neural complexity and loading in certain areas of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baylor.edu/content/services/document.php/104508.pdf Insider – The Female Brain, By Ivory E.

Similar claims were previously made by Ho et al. (1980), who measured 1,261 brains at autopsy, and Beals et al. (1984), who measured approximately 20,000 skulls, finding the same [[East Asian]] → [[Europe]]an → [[Africa]]n pattern but warning against using the findings as indicative of racial traits, "If one merely lists such means by geographical region or race, causes of similarity by genogroup and ecotype are hopelessly confounded".&lt;ref name="beals"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Beals Kenneth L.

Z. Cernovsky that people from different climates tend to have minor differences in brain size.

===Race, identity and cranio-facial description===
[[File:Plaster face casts of Nias islanders by J.P. Kleiweg de Zwaan circa1910.jpg|thumb|Plaster face casts of [[Nias]] islanders collected by J.P. Kleiweg de Zwaan, circa 1910]]
Observable craniofacial differences included: head shape (mesocephalic, brachycephalic, dolichocephalic) breadth of nasal aperture, nasal root height, sagittal crest appearance, jaw thickness, brow ridge size and forehead slope. Using this skull-based categorization, anthropologists{{who|date=October 2011}} identified three or four racial groups, based upon terminology created by German philosopher Christoph Meiners in his The Outline of History of Mankind (1785);

*[[Caucasian race|Caucasoid]] characterized by a tall dolichocephalic skull, receded zygomas, large brow ridge and projecting-narrow nasal apertures.
*[[Negroid]] characterized by a short dolichocephalic skull, receded zygomas and wide nasal apertures.
*[[Mongoloid]] characterized by a medium brachycephalic skull, projecting zygomas, small brow ridge and small nasal apertures.

Ripley's ''The Races of Europe'' was rewritten in 1939 by Harvard physical anthropologist [[Carleton S. Coon]]. [[Carleton S. Coon]], a 20th-century craniofacial anthropometrist, used the technique for his ''The Origin of Races'' (New York: Knopf, 1962). Because of the inconsistencies in the old three-part system (Caucasoid, Mongoloid, Negroid), Coon adopted a five-part scheme. He defined "Caucasoid" as a pattern of skull measurements and other phenotypical characteristics typical of populations in [[Europe]], [[Central Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[West Asia]], [[North Africa]], and Northeast Africa ([[Ethiopia]], and [[Somalia]]). He discarded the term "Negroid" as misleading since it implies skin-tone, which is found at low latitudes around the globe and is a product of adaptation, and defined skulls typical of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] as "Congoid" and those of [[Southern Africa]] as "Capoid". Finally, he split "Australoid" from "Mongoloid" along a line roughly similar to the modern distinction between sinodonts in the north and sundadonts in the south. He argued that these races had developed independently of each other over the past half-million years, developing into Homo Sapiens at different periods of time, resulting in different levels of civilization. This raised considerable controversy and led the [[American Anthropological Association]] to reject his approach without mentioning him by name.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, Jonathan ''What it means to be 98% Chimpanzee'' University of California Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-520-24064-3}} pp. 76-77 [https://books.google.com/books?id=HUBe0wjowLMC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=coon+%22origin+of+races%22&amp;ei=GqDKSLzvDZX4iQGF4KX3Cw&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U1EeYDoitthqhZ9pvsJmzVAqFLQMA#PPA76,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Races of Europe (Coon)|The Races of Europe]]'' (1939) Coon classified Caucasoids into racial sub-groups named after regions or archaeological sites such as Brünn, Borreby, Alpine, Ladogan, East Baltic, Neo-Danubian, Lappish, Mediterranean, Atlanto-Mediterranean, Irano-Afghan, Nordic, Hallstatt, Keltic, Tronder, Dinaric, Noric and Armenoid. This typological view of race, however, was starting to be seen as out-of-date at the time of publication. Coon eventually resigned from the [[American Association of Physical Anthropologists]], while some of his other works were discounted because he would not agree with the evidence brought forward by [[Franz Boas]], [[Stephen Jay Gould]], [[Richard Lewontin]], [[Leonard Lieberman]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssc.uwo.ca/psychology/faculty/rushtonpdfs/Lieberman2001CA.pdf How Caucasoids Got Such Big Crania and How They Shrank] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902203425/http://www.ssc.uwo.ca/psychology/faculty/rushtonpdfs/Lieberman2001CA.pdf |date=2009-09-02 }}, by Leonard Lieberman&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ice Warrior Project''' is an organisation founded in 2001 by the explorer [[Jim McNeill]]. Its remit is to develop people from all walks of life and echelons of society into modern-day explorers; to discover change in the world’s most remote regions under the guidance of partner leading scientific authorities; and deliver these discoveries in an engaging, human manner to audiences around the globe.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.ice-warrior.com/about Ice Warrior &gt; About]&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation provides raw, scientific data for others to go on and interpret. Its rationale for doing so is that if we do not monitor these regions, which were described by Nobel peace prize nominee&lt;ref name="nobel"&gt;[[Sheila Watt-Cloutier#Awards and honors|Sheila Watt-Cloutier Awards and Honours]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheila Watt-Cloutier]] as "clearly one of the most important regions when it comes to climate change.",&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;[http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/ja08/insidestory.asp Canadian Geographic]&lt;/ref&gt; then how will we know that any action to mitigate the human impact on our Earth is actually working?

The project's founder [[Jim McNeill]] maintains that without such knowledge how can we be true guardians of the planet on which we live? And if we are not, then this ultimately affects our chances of survival as a species. 

As an organisation it has an altruistic project side which relies on corporate sponsorship and involves charitable work and also an underpinning commercial side.

'''Ionized bracelets''', or '''ionic bracelets''', are a type of metal [[bracelet]] [[jewelry]] purported to affect the [[qi|chi]] of the wearer.  No claims of effectiveness made by manufacturers have ever been substantiated by independent sources, and the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) has found the bracelets are "part of a scheme devised to defraud".&lt;ref name="FTC06"&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2006/09/qray.shtm Court rules in FTC's favor in Q-Ray bracelet case] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825181525/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2006/09/qray.shtm |date=August 25, 2009 }} [[U.S. Federal Trade Commission]] (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/copper-and-magnetic-healing-bracelets-are-pseudoscience Quackwear: Big Pseudoscience Wants to Sell You Wearable Metal to Improve Your Health; Alternet; January 10, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Q-Ray, Balance, Bio-Ray, IRenew, Rayma, and Rico's Bio-Energy brand bracelets are considered to be of the "ionized" family.&lt;ref name="ionic-health"&gt;[http://www.ionic-health.com/q-ray_balance-bracelet.asp QRay Ionized Bracelets] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509065803/http://www.ionic-health.com/q-ray_balance-bracelet.asp |date=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[alternative medicine|alternative health]] bracelets, such as [[magnet therapy|magnetic]] or [[copper]] therapy bracelets, are considered a different type of product.

==History==
In October 1973, corporate websites claim,{{clarify|date=November 2013}} Manuel L. Polo began investigating the effects of different metals on humans, believing that some metals offered a benefit when worn.  This led directly to his creation of the Bio-Ray (Biomagnetic Regulator), the first ionized bracelet.&lt;ref name=bioray&gt;[http://www.bio-ray.org/ Bio Ray]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2016|reason=not supported by given website|talk=Save this article}}

In 1994, Andrew Park bought a Bio-Ray bracelet while visiting [[Barcelona, Spain]]. Believing that it had reduced his lower back pain, he was inspired to found [[QT Inc.]], which began manufacturing and selling Q-Ray bracelets in the [[United States]] by 1996.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt;

===Marketing claims===
Western interest in the Q-Ray Ionized Bracelet rose as a result of an [[infomercial]] campaign by [[QT Inc.]] which ran from August 2000 through June 11, 2003.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/2007/11/14/a_qray_timeline/ A Q-Ray timeline] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116132724/http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/2007/11/14/a_qray_timeline/ |date=November 16, 2007 }} ''CBC Marketplace'' 14 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time many [[marketing claim]]s were made regarding the product's alleged effectiveness, most notably regarding relief from pain and arthritis due to manipulation of a body's [[qi|chi]].

In a [[Marketplace (Canadian TV program)|Marketplace]] interview, Charles Park, president of Q-Ray Canada, explains that the term "ionized" does not mean the bracelets themselves are [[ionization|ionized]], but rather that the term comes from their secret "ionization process" which, he asserts, affects the bracelets in undisclosed ways.&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/2007/11/14/buying_belief/ Meet the little bracelet that raises big questions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117230307/http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/2007/11/14/buying_belief/ |date=November 17, 2007 }} ''CBC Marketplace'' 14 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===FTC action===
These claims were the topic of a 2003 injunction by the [[Federal Trade Commission]]&lt;ref name="FTC03"&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2003/06/qtinc.htm FTC halts deceptive pain relief claims]. [[U.S. Federal Trade Commission]] (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and later a high-profile court ruling in 2006.&lt;ref name="FTC06" /&gt;  The court was unable to find any basis for QT Inc.'s claims related to [[traditional Chinese medicine]], concluding that it was "part of a scheme devised by QT Inc to defraud its consumers".&lt;ref name="FTC06" /&gt;

==Research==
A [[placebo-controlled study|placebo controlled]] [[randomized trial]] study published in the journal ''[[Mayo Clinic Proceedings]]'' compared the effect of ionized bracelet produced by Q-ray to an identically appearing placebo bracelet.  The study found no difference between the ionized bracelet and control with respect to musculoskeletal pain, suggesting the effects of Q-ray bracelet was due to the [[placebo effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bratton|first1=RL|last2=Montero|first2=DP|last3=Adams|first3=KS|last4=Novas|first4=MA|last5=McKay|first5=TC|last6=Hall|first6=LJ|last7=Foust|first7=JG|last8=Mueller|first8=MB|last9=O'Brien|first9=PC|last10=Atkinson|first10=EJ|last11=Maurer|first11=MS|title=Effect of "ionized" wrist bracelets on musculoskeletal pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.|journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings|date=Nov 2002|volume=77|issue=11|pages=1164–8|pmid=12440551|doi=10.4065/77.11.1164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Davis''' or '''Davys'''  (c. 1550{{spaced ndash}}29 December 1605) (b. 1543?) was one of the chief English navigators of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. He led several voyages to discover the [[Northwest Passage]] and served as pilot and captain on both Dutch and English voyages to the [[East Indies]]. He discovered the [[Falkland Islands]] (today a [[British Overseas Territory]]) in August 1592.

It is important that Captain John Davis of Sandridge should not be confused with a contemporary, Captain John Davis of Limehouse. Both served in the fleet of Captain [[James Lancaster]] during the first voyage of the [[East India Company]] to the East Indies.

==Life and career==
Davis was born in the parish of [[Stoke Gabriel]] in [[Devon]] circa 1550, and spent his childhood in Sandridge Barton nearby. It has been suggested{{by whom?|date=September 2017}} that he learned much of his seamanship as a child while plying boats along the river Dart, and went to sea at an early age. His childhood neighbours included Adrian Gilbert and [[Humphrey Gilbert]] and their half-brother [[Walter Raleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Markham|first1= Albert Hastings| author-link1 = Albert Hastings Markham |title= Voyages and Works of John Davis|year= 1880|publisher= The Hakluyt Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From early on, he also became friends with [[John Dee]].&lt;ref name="Cancan"/&gt;

He began pitching a voyage in search of the [[Northwest Passage]] to the queen's secretary [[Francis Walsingham]] in 1583.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; Two years later, in 1585, the secretary relented and funded the expedition, which traced [[Martin Frobisher|Frobisher]]'s route to [[Greenland]]'s east coast, around [[Kap Farvel|Cape Farewell]], and west towards [[Baffin Island]].&lt;ref name="Cancan"/&gt; In 1586 he returned to the Arctic with four ships, two of which were sent to Greenland's iceberg-calving eastern shore; the other two penetrated [[Davis Strait|the strait which came to bear his name]] as far as [[67th parallel north|67°N]] before being blocked by the [[Arctic ice cap]]. ''Sunshine'' attempted (and failed) to circumnavigate the island from the east.&lt;ref name="gosh"&gt;Gosch, C.C.A. ''[https://archive.org/details/danisharcticexp00unkngoog Danish Arctic Expeditions, 1605 to 1620. Book I.—The Danish Expeditions to Greenland in 1605, 1606, and 1607; to which is added Captain James Hall's Voyage to Greenland in 1612.]'' Hakluyt Society (London), 1897.&lt;/ref&gt; The initially amiable approach Davis adopted to the [[Inuit people|Inuit]] {{ndash}} bringing musicians and having the crew dance and play with them&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; {{ndash}} changed after they stole one of his anchors; they were likely irate at having been interrupted during one of their religious ceremonies. Inuit also attacked his ships in [[Hamilton Inlet]] (Labrador).&lt;ref name="Cancan"/&gt; A third expedition in 1587 reached [[72nd parallel north|72°12'N]] and [[Disko Island]] before unfavorable winds forced it back. On his return, Davis charted the [[Davis Inlet]] in the coast of [[Labrador]]. The log of this trip remained a textbook model for later captains for centuries.&lt;ref name="Cancan"/&gt;

In 1588 he seems to have commanded ''Black Dog'' against the [[Spanish Armada]].&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/152794/John-Davis|title= John Davis at the Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate= 9 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1589 he joined the [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland|Earl of Cumberland]] as part of the [[Azores Voyage of 1589]]. In 1591 he accompanied [[Thomas Cavendish]] on Cavendish's last voyage, which sought to discover the [[Northwest Passage]] "upon the back parts of America" (i.e., from the western entrance). After the rest of Cavendish's expedition returned unsuccessful, Davis continued to attempt on his own account the passage of the [[Strait of Magellan]]; though defeated by foul weather, he probably discovered the [[Falkland Islands]] in August 1592 aboard ''[[Desire (ship)|Desire]]''. His crew was forced to kill hundreds of penguins for food on the islands, but the stored meat spoiled in the tropics and only fourteen of his 76 men made it home alive.

From 1596 to 1597 Davis seems to have sailed with [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] to [[Cádiz]] and the Azores as master of Raleigh's ship; from 1598 to 1600 he accompanied a [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] expedition to the [[East Indies]] as pilot, sailing from Flushing and returning to Middleburg, while carefully charting and recording geographical details. He narrowly escaped destruction from treachery at [[Aceh|Achin]] on [[Sumatra]].

From 1601 to 1603 he accompanied Sir [[James Lancaster]] as Pilot-Major on the first voyage of the English [[East India Company]]. For his part Davis was to receive £500 (around £1.5 million at 2015 values&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Relative Value of a U.K. Pound|url= https://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php?year_source=1600&amp;amount=500&amp;year_result=2016|publisher= MeasuringWorth.com|accessdate= 2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) if the voyage doubled its original investment, £1,000 if three times, £1,500 if four times and £2,000 if five times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Sir Clements Robert|last= Markham|author-link= Clements Markham|title= The Voyages of Sir James Lancaster, Kt., to the East Indies: With Abstracts of Journals of Voyages to the East Indies During the Seventeenth Century, Preserved in the India Office : and the Voyage of Captain John Knight (1606), to Seek the North-west Passage|url= https://archive.org/details/voyagesofsirjame00markrich|year= 1877|publisher= [[Hakluyt Society]]|page= v}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before departure, Davis had told London merchants that pepper could be obtained in [[Aceh]] at a price of four [[Spanish dollar|reals of eight]] per [[hundredweight]] - whereas it actually cost 20.

In the centuries after his death, the importance of Dutch [[whaling|whalers]] actually led the settlements along [[Greenland]]'s western coast to be called "Straat Davis" after their name for the Strait, while the name "Greenland" was used to refer to the eastern shore, erroneously presumed to be the site of the [[Norse colonization of Greenland|Norse]] [[Eastern Settlement]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Publications==
Davis's explorations in the Arctic were published by [[Richard Hakluyt]] and appeared on his world map. Davis himself published a valuable treatise on practical navigation called ''The Seaman's Secrets''&lt;!--EB is in error.--&gt; in 1594 and a more theoretical work called ''The World's Hydrographical Description'' in 1595. The account of Davis's last voyage was written by Michelborne on his return to England in 1606.

==Inventions==
His invention of the [[backstaff]] and double quadrant (called the [[Davis quadrant|Davis Quadrant]] after him) remained popular among English seamen until long after [[Octant (instrument)|Hadley's reflecting quadrant]] had been introduced.&lt;ref name="Cancan"&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=John Davis: Master Navigator | date=19 March 2004 | publisher= | url =http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/206/301/lac-bac/explorers/www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/explorers/h24-1350-e.html| work =Collections Canada | pages = | accessdate = 9 June 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judith Massare''' is a paleontologist specializing in [[Mesozoic]] [[marine reptile]] research. In [[1987 in paleontology|1987]],  Massare published an analysis of plesiosaur feeding habits. She concluded that the long-necked [[plesiosauroids]] ate soft prey. ''[[Liopleurodon]]'' and its relatives, on the other hand, had teeth resembling those of [[killer whales]] and probably ate larger, bonier prey.&lt;ref name="ellis-pliosaurs-184" /&gt; The next year, Massare analyzed Mesozoic marine reptile swimming abilities and found that long-necked plesiosaurs would have been significantly slower than pliosaurs due to excess drag incurred from their large round bodies.&lt;ref name="ellis-plesiosaurs-152" /&gt;

'''''Les Aventures électriques de Zeltron''''' is an educational children's television series broadcast in [[Antenne 2]]'s [[Récré A2]] program in France and [[TVJQ]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Télé-Câble|url=http://collections.banq.qc.ca:81/lapresse/src/cahiers/1983/06/01/07/82812_1983060107.pdf|accessdate=15 December 2016|work=La Presse|date=1 June 1983|location=Montreal, Quebec|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Quebec. The show was sponsored by [[Électricité de France]] (EDF) and was produced from 1979 to 1982.&lt;ref name="Bouvier"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bouvier|first1=Yves|title=Patrimoine en poche : Électricité de France et l’objet publicitaire|journal=Flux|publisher=Metropolis||date=April 2010|issue=82|url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-flux-2010-4-page-24.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329230539/http://www.cairn.info/revue-flux-2010-4-page-24.htm|archive-date=2016-03-29|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The companies D-3-mil and CIP Vidéo worked on the show and the staff included Marcel Dupuoy.&lt;ref name="Carletti"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carletti|first1=Sébastien|title=Nos années Récré A2, 1978-1988|date=2013-09-28|publisher=Flammarion|isbn=978-2081301559|page=55|url=https://www.facebook.com/nosanneesrecreA2/photos/a.119567641551556.1073741829.119491531559167/119909928183994/?type=3&amp;theater|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show features an extraterrestrial named Zeltron (Michel Elias), who resembles a small blue [[Insulator (electricity)|insulator]] with orange limbs and a bolt on top, who teaches electricity-related subjects and history. Some episodes include his interactions with a boy and girl living in Earth. Episodes end with a question the viewer can answer through postcard. Another character is the robot Voltix.&lt;ref name="Carletti" /&gt;

In the show's production, Zeltron and Voltix are marionettes with different colors from their appearance in the show. A process was used to achieve animation-like visuals for the two characters. Early in the show's run, the backgrounds were illustrated before switching to reel footage.&lt;ref name="Carletti" /&gt;

The character Zeltron was created by François Castan and made an earlier appearance in Salon de l'enfance. Zeltron was promoted to children through merchandise such as plastic figures, comics published by GP, [[Panini Group|Panini]] figurines, and a key ring with Zeltron with movable eyes. According to Yves Bouvier of the [[University of Savoy]], Zeltron was the most successful EDF effort to teach the concepts of electricity and to promote its brand towards children.&lt;ref name="Bouvier" /&gt;

Announced on 4 October 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Mail &amp; Guardian Online, "Biggest diamond of the century found in Lesotho", [[Mail &amp; Guardian]], http://www.mg.co.za/articlepage.aspx?area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__business/&amp;articleid=285786 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001005425/http://www.mg.co.za/articlepage.aspx?area=%2Fbreaking_news%2Fbreaking_news__business%2F&amp;articleid=285786 |date=2007-10-01 }} (accessed 2006-10-10)&lt;/ref&gt; it was the largest reported find this century and the 15th largest diamond ever found. The stone is [[Diamond color|rated 'D']], the top colour band for diamonds.

The diamond was sold at an [[auction]] on 9 October 2006 in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]], for [[United States dollar|US$]]12.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News Online, "Massive diamond bought for $12m", [[BBC]], http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034429.stm (accessed 2006-10-09)&lt;/ref&gt; The buyer, The South African Diamond Corporation [http://www.safdico.com (SAFDICO)], expected to sell the diamond for more than US $20 million after cutting.

In July 2007 the finished stones were unveiled. The largest gem cut from the crystal is a {{convert|75|carat|g}} pear-shaped diamond, and the smallest is a {{convert|0.55|carat|g}} round brilliant. In all, twenty-six stones were fashioned from the rough gem, figuring as seven pear shapes, four emerald cuts, thirteen round brilliants and one heart shape. The finished gems total {{convert|224|carat|g}}.

The [[Lesotho Brown]] (usually simply called the Lesotho) at 601 carats (120 g) was the largest diamond previously found at the mine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9323">This is a '''list of building materials'''.  Many types of [[building material]]s are used in the [[construction]] industry to create [[:Category:Buildings and structures|buildings and structures]].

These categories of materials and products are used by [[architect]]s and construction [[project manager]]s to specify the materials and methods used for [[Construction|building projects]].

Some building materials like cold rolled steel framing are considered modern methods of construction, over the traditionally slower methods like blockwork and timber.  Many building materials have a variety of uses, therefore it is always a good idea to consult the manufacturer to check if a product is best suited to your requirements.

==Catalogs==
Catalogs distributed by architectural product suppliers are typically organized into these groups.

This is the '''list of [[countries]] that border only one other country''', with only [[land border]]s being counted. Some of these countries have several neighbours "across the sea". As an example Denmark "borders" Sweden and Norway by sea, and Canada has sea boundaries with [[Denmark]] (between [[Baffin Island]] and [[Greenland]]) and [[France]] (between the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and the territory of [[St. Pierre and Miquelon]]). Other countries, such as Sri Lanka, border only one other country by sea.

There are generally three possible arrangements by which a country can have a single border. The first is with a divided island such a [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]], or [[Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. The second is a peninsular relationship, where the first country borders the second and is otherwise surrounded by sea, while the second country borders other countries, as with [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], [[Denmark]] and [[Germany]], or [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. The third is the circumstance where the first country is a small country that is landlocked and completely surrounded by the second, larger country, as with [[Vatican City|The Vatican]] and [[Italy]], or [[Lesotho]] and [[South Africa]].

Territory leased or ceded by one country to another for perpetual use, but not in sovereignty, such as [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] in [[Cuba]], or memorials, such as the [[Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial|American Cemetery]] in France, do not constitute true territorial borders, because the land occupied remains a formal part of the host country.

This list is based on the [[Correlates of War]] Direct Contiguity data set, with causeways and bridges not being counted. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Direct Contiguity Data, 1816-2016. Version 3.2|url=http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/direct-contiguity|publisher=Correlates of War Project|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causeways, bridges, and tunnels ==
[[File:Manama bahrain.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Passport Island, site of the land border between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, is seen at the far left. Each nation has a border checkpoint on the island on opposite sides of the border.]]
Borders relevant to this list may include short borders in the middle of man-made constructions.
;Has a land border, and a second artificial border
* {{flag|Denmark}}: in addition to its border with [[Germany]], technically also has an extremely short border with [[Sweden]] across the [[Øresund Bridge]].
* {{flag|United Kingdom}}: in addition to its border with [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], has a border with [[France]] in the [[Channel Tunnel]].
;Has no land border, but an artificial border
* {{flag|Bahrain}}: although an island nation with no natural land borders, it is connected to [[Saudi Arabia]] by the [[King Fahd Causeway]] at [[Passport Island]].
* {{flag|Singapore}}: although an island nation with no natural land borders, is connected to [[Malaysia]] by the  [[Johor Causeway]] and the [[Malaysia–Singapore Second Link]].

== Dependent territories ==
In some cases, a [[dependent territory]] of one nation borders another nation.

* {{flag|Akrotiri and Dhekelia}}: British sovereign base areas, border the [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]]. Dhekelia also borders the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]], but the latter is recognised only by Turkey.
* {{flag|French Southern and Antarctic Lands}}: [[Adélie Land]], [[France]]'s (largely unrecognised) claim in [[Antarctica]] borders only the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]]. (It also touches other claims at the [[South Pole]].)
* {{flag|Gibraltar}}: a [[British overseas territory]], occupies a small [[peninsula]] and has a {{Convert|1.2|km||abbr=on}} land border with [[Spain]].
* {{flag|Greenland}}: a constituent country of the Kingdom of Denmark, has a border dispute with Canada on the border near or on [[Hans Island]]. The island is located in the centre of the [[Kennedy Channel]] of [[Nares Strait]] (between Canada's [[Ellesmere Island]] and northern Greenland). Both countries claim Hans Island and the border is not defined. 
* {{flag|Hong Kong}}: comprising a continental portion and more than 200 islands in the [[South China Sea]], was formerly ceded and leased by [[Qing China]] to the [[British Empire|United Kingdom]]. It was returned to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1997, but has since then operated with its own judicial system under the policy of "[[One Country, Two Systems]]". The land border and coastline, although no longer one between two states, are still controlled as though Hong Kong were an international exclave.
* {{flag|Macau}}: comprises a peninsula and one island in the [[South China Sea]], {{Convert|60|km||abbr=on}} west of Hong Kong, and like Hong Kong was formerly administered by a colonial power (in this case, [[Portugal]]) but returned to the People's Republic of China in 1999. It too has its own judicial system and retains border and coastal controls similar to those of an exclave. 
* {{flagicon|New Zealand}} [[Ross Dependency]]: [[New Zealand]]'s (largely unrecognised) territorial claim in Antarctica borders only the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]] and the unclaimed [[Marie Byrd Land]]. (It also touches other claims at the [[South Pole]].)
* {{flagicon|France}}/[[Image:Flag_of_Sint_Maarten.svg|border|22px]] [[Saint Martin]]: The island is split between two island territories: the northern half, [[Saint Martin (France)|Saint-Martin]], is a [[France|French]] [[overseas collectivity]]; the southern half, [[Sint Maarten]], is a constituent country of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]].

== Historical ==
There were many countries that historically had only one neighbour. Some no longer exist while others now have either no land borders or borders with more than one nation due to border changes.

* [[Korea]] bordered only [[China]] for several hundred years before 1860, after which a second international border with [[Russia]] appeared (approx. {{Convert|17|km||abbr=on}} long), according to the [[Convention of Peking]]. Following the division of Korea in 1945 only [[North Korea]] now shares this border.
* [[Ciskei]], one of the [[South Africa]]n [[homeland (South Africa)|"independent" homelands]], reincorporated on April 27, 1994.
* [[Venda]], one of the [[South Africa]]n [[homeland (South Africa)|"independent" homelands]], was a true enclave bordering only South Africa and separated narrowly from Zimbabwe by the Madimbo corridor to the north; reincorporated on April 27, 1994.
* [[Dominion of Newfoundland]], with [[Canada]], until March 31, 1949 when it became the Canadian province of Newfoundland (now named [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]).
* The [[Kingdom of Scotland]] and the [[Kingdom of England]] bordered each other until 1707 when Scotland and England were united by the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]], see [[Anglo-Scottish border]].
* [[Japan]] bordered [[Russia]] on the island of [[Sakhalin]] from 1905 until 1910, when a second border with [[Manchuria]] (China) and the [[Russian Far East]] appeared upon Japan's annexation of Korea. Both Sakhalin and Korea were relinquished in 1945. (See [[Karafuto Prefecture]] and [[Empire of Japan]]).
* [[Weihaiwei under British rule|Weihaiwei]], 1898–1930, British colony on a leased territory from Manchu Qing Empire. Transferred to the Republic of China in 1930.
* The [[Colony of Tasmania]] bordered only by the [[Colony of Victoria]] (on [[Boundary Islet]]), until the creation of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901.

Eponymous [[Surgery|surgical procedures]] are generally named after the [[surgeon]] or surgeons who performed or reported them first. In some instances they are named after the surgeon who popularised them or refined existing procedures, and occasionally are named after the patient who first underwent the procedure.

A '''[[glacier]]''' ({{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|ɡ|l|eɪ|ʃ|ər}} {{respell|GLAY|shər}}) or ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|ɡ|l|æ|s|i|ə}}) is a persistent body of dense [[ice]] that is constantly moving under its own weight; it forms where the accumulation of [[snow]] exceeds its [[ablation]] (melting and [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]) over many years, often [[centuries]]. Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating [[crevasse]]s, [[serac]]s, and other distinguishing features. Because glacial mass is affected by long-term [[climate]] changes, e.g., [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[temperature|mean temperature]], and [[cloud cover]], [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacial mass change]]s are considered among the most sensitive indicators of [[climate change]].

===Antarctica===
[[File:Fryxellsee Opt.jpg|right|thumb|[[Canada Glacier]] in Antarctica]]
{{main|List of glaciers in the Antarctic}}

There are many glaciers in the Antarctic. This set of lists does not include [[ice sheet]]s, [[ice cap]]s or [[ice field]]s, such as the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], but includes [[Glacier|glacial]] features that are defined by their flow, rather than general bodies of ice. The lists include [[Glacier morphology#Outlet glaciers|outlet glaciers]], [[Glacier morphology#Valley glaciers|valley glaciers]], [[Glacier morphology#Cirque glaciers|cirque glaciers]], [[Glacier#Types of glaciers|tidewater glaciers]] and [[ice stream]]s. Ice streams are a type of glacier&lt;ref name="NSIDC" /&gt; and many of them have "glacier" in their name, e.g. [[Pine Island Glacier]]. [[Ice shelf|Ice shelves]] are listed separately in the [[List of Antarctic ice shelves]]. For the purposes of these lists, the [[Antarctic]] is defined as any [[latitude]] further south than 60° (the continental limit according to the [[Antarctic Treaty System]]).&lt;ref name="nbTreatyText" /&gt;

There are also glaciers in the subantarctic. This includes one [[snow field]] ([[Murray Snowfield]]). Snow fields are not glaciers in the strict sense of the word, but they are commonly found at the [[accumulation zone]] or head of a glacier.&lt;ref name=nsidc&gt;{{cite web

{{main|List of glaciers in Europe}}

The majority of Europe's glaciers are found in the Alps, Caucasus and the Scandinavian Mountains (mostly Norway) as well as in Iceland. Iceland has the largest glacier in Europe, [[Vatnajökull]] glacier, that covers between 8,100-8,300&amp;nbsp;km² in area and 3,100&amp;nbsp;km³ in volume. Norway alone has more than 2500 glaciers (including very small ones) covering an estimated 1% of mainland Norway's surface area. Several of mainland Europe's biggest glaciers are found here including; [[Jostedal Glacier|Jostedalsbreen]](the largest in mainland Europe at 487&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), [[Svartisen|Vestre Svartisen]](221&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), [[Søndre Folgefonna]](168&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[Svartisen|Østre Svartisen]](148&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

{{maincat|Glaciers of North America}}
There are a number of glaciers existing in North America, currently or in recent centuries. In the United States, these [[glacier]]s are located in nine states, all in the Rocky Mountains or further west. The southernmost named glacier among them is the [[Lilliput Glacier]] in [[Tulare County, California|Tulare County]], east of the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] of California.

[[Mexico]] has about two dozen glaciers, all of which are located on [[Pico de Orizaba]] (Citlaltépetl), [[Popocatépetl]] and [[Iztaccíhuatl]], the three tallest mountains in the country.&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=Sidney E.|title=Glaciers of Mexico|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/p1386j/mexico/mexico-lores.pdf|work=Glaciers of North America|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=July 8, 2012|format=pdf|date=2001|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017213832/http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/p1386j/mexico/mexico-lores.pdf|archivedate=October 17, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
{{main|List of glaciers in South America}}
[[File:Chimborazo.jpg|thumb|[[Chimborazo]]]]
Glaciers in South America develop exclusively on the [[Andes]] and are subject of the Andes various climatic regimes namely the [[Tropical Andes]], [[Dry Andes]] and the [[Wet Andes]]. Apart from this there is a wide range of latitudes on which glaciers develop from 5000 m in the [[Altiplano]] [[mountains]] and [[volcanoes]] to reaching sealevel as tidewater glaciers from [[San Rafael Lagoon]] (45° S) and southwards. South America hosts two large [[ice field]]s, the [[Northern Patagonian Ice Field|Northern]] and [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field]]s, of which the second is the largest contiguous body of glaciers in extrapolar regions.

The '''glaciers of Chile''' cover 2.7% (20,188&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conama.cl/portal/1301/articles-43721_recurso_1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923210108/http://www.conama.cl/portal/1301/articles-43721_recurso_1.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) of the land area of the country, excluding [[Antártica Chilena]], and have a considerable impact on its landscape and water supply. By surface 80% of South America’s glaciers lie in Chile. Glaciers develop in the [[Andes]] of Chile from 27˚S southwards and in a very few places north of 18°30'S in the extreme north of the country:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geography.osu.edu/faculty/bmark/2008%20ESR%20Vuille_etal.pdf Climate change and tropical Andean glaciers: Past, present and future] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106032056/http://www.geography.osu.edu/faculty/bmark/2008%20ESR%20Vuille_etal.pdf |date=2012-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in between they are absent because of extreme aridity, though [[rock glacier]]s formed from [[permafrost]] are common. The largest glaciers of Chile are the [[Northern Patagonian Ice Field|Northern]] and [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field]]s. From a latitude of 47° S and south some glaciers reach sea level.

Apart from height and latitude, the settings of Chilean glaciers depend on precipitation patterns; in this sense two different regions exist: the [[Dry Andes]] and the [[Wet Andes]].

[[File:Puncak Jaya glaciers 1850-2003 evolution map-fr.gif|thumb|right|Animated map of the extent of the glaciers of the [[Carstensz Glacier|Carstens Range]] from 1850 to 2003]]
No glaciers remain on the [[Australia]] mainland or [[Tasmania]]. A few, like the [[Heard Island glaciers]] are located in the territory of [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]] in the southern [[Indian Ocean]].

[[New Guinea]] has the  [[Puncak Jaya#Glaciers|Puncak Jaya]] glacier.

[[New Zealand]] contains many [[glaciers]], mostly located near the Main Divide of the [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]] in the [[South Island]]. They are classed as mid-latitude mountain glaciers. There are eighteen small glaciers in the [[North Island]] on [[Mount Ruapehu]].&lt;ref&gt;Chinn, Trevor J.H., (1988),[http://pubs.usgs.gov/prof/p1386h/nzealand/nzealand.html Glaciers of New Zealand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706135734/http://pubs.usgs.gov/prof/p1386h/nzealand/nzealand.html |date=2008-07-06 }}, in ''Satellite image atlas of glaciers of the world'', U.S. Geological Survey professional paper; 1386, {{ISBN|0-607-71457-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An inventory of South Island glaciers compiled in the 1980s indicated there were about 3,155 glaciers with an area of at least one hectare (2.5 acres).&lt;ref&gt;Chinn, Trevor J.H., (1988), [http://pubs.usgs.gov/prof/p1386h/nzealand/nzealand.html Glaciers of New Zealand], in ''Satellite image atlas of glaciers of the world'', U.S. Geological Survey professional paper; 1386, {{ISBN|0-607-71457-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately one sixth of these glaciers covered more than 10 hectares. These include:
*[[Fox Glacier]]
*[[Franz Josef Glacier]]
*[[Hooker Glacier (New Zealand)|Hooker Glacier]]
*[[Mueller Glacier]]
*[[Murchison Glacier]]

The '''Marcel Benoist Prize''', offered by the '''Marcel Benoist Foundation''', is a monetary prize that has been offered annually since 1920 to a [[scientist]] of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] nationality or residency who has made the most useful scientific discovery.  Emphasis is placed on those discoveries affecting human life. Since 1997, candidates in the [[humanities]] have also been eligible for the prize.

The Marcel Benoist Foundation was established by the will of the French lawyer Marcel Benoist, a wartime resident of [[Lausanne]], who died in 1918. It is managed by a group of trustees comprising the Swiss interior minister and heads of the main [[List of universities in Switzerland|Swiss universities]]. It is often dubbed the "Swiss Nobel Prize." &lt;ref&gt;Fabien Goubet, Et la lumière fut téléportée, Le Temps, 28 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The current laureate is [[Lars-Erik Cederman]].&lt;ref name=snf&gt;{{cite web |author=Swiss National Science Foundation |title=Marcel Benoist Swiss Science Prize is awarded to Lars-Erik Cederman |url=http://www.snf.ch/en/researchinFocus/newsroom/pages/news-180903-lars-eric-cederman-receives-the-benoist-prize.aspx |accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The first award was given to [[immunologist]] [[Nicolas Maurice Arthus|Maurice Arthus]] (1862–1945) at the [[University of Lausanne]].  Other winners have included [[computer scientist]] [[Niklaus Wirth]], [[astronomer]] [[Michel Mayor]], and cardiologist [[Max Holzmann]]. {{As of|2003}}, nine Marcel Benoist winners have later also won the [[Nobel Prize]]: Paul Karrer, Walter R. Hess, Leopold Ruzicka, Tadeus Reichstein, Vladimir Prelog, Niels Kaj Jerne, Richard R. Ernst, Johannes G. Bednorz &amp; Karl Alexander Müller, and Kurt Wüthrich.

In 2009, [[Françoise Gisou van der Goot]] ([[École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne]]) was the first woman to win the Marcel Benoist Prize.

[[File:Naval Architecture Course of Study.png|alt=Curriculum of Naval Architecture |thumb|256x256px|General Course of Study leading to Naval Architecture degree]]
'''Naval architecture''', or '''naval engineering''', along with [[automotive engineering]] and [[aerospace engineering]], is an [[engineering]] discipline branch of [[vehicle engineering]], incorporating elements of mechanical, electrical, electronic, software and safety engineering as applied to the [[engineering design process]], [[shipbuilding]], maintenance, and operation of [[watercraft|marine vessels]] and structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rina.org.uk/careers_in_naval_architecture.html RINA – Careers in Naval Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biran, Adrian; (2003). Ship hydrostatics and stability (1st Ed.) – [[Butterworth-Heinemann]]. {{ISBN|0-7506-4988-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naval architecture involves basic and applied research, design, development, design evaluation and calculations during all stages of the life of a marine vehicle. Preliminary design of the vessel, its detailed design, [[Shipbuilding|construction]], [[Sea trial|trials]], operation and maintenance, launching and [[dry-docking]] are the main activities involved. Ship design calculations are also required for ships being [[Ship#Repair and conversion|modified]] (by means of conversion, rebuilding, modernization, or [[ship repair|repair]]). Naval architecture also involves formulation of safety regulations and damage-control rules and the approval and certification of ship designs to meet [[statutory]] and non-statutory requirements.

==Main subjects==
The word "vessel" includes every description of [[watercraft]], including non-displacement craft, [[Ground effect vehicle|WIG craft]] and [[seaplane]]s, used or capable of being used as a means of [[Water transport|transportation on water]].&lt;ref&gt;Convention On The [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]], 1972,As Amended; [[International Maritime Organization]]; {{ISBN|92-801-4167-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal elements of naval architecture are:&lt;ref&gt;Lewis V, Edward (Ed.); (June 1989). Principles of Naval Architecture (2nd Rev.) Vol. 1 – [[Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers]]. {{ISBN|0-939773-00-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrostatics===
[[Image:Lines plan en.svg|thumb|right|200px|Body plan of a ship showing the hull form]]
[[Hydrostatics]] concerns the conditions to which the vessel is subjected while at rest in water and to its ability to remain afloat. This involves computing [[buoyancy]], [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]], and other hydrostatic properties such as [[Sailing ballast|trim]] (the measure of the longitudinal inclination of the vessel) and [[Ship stability|stability]] (the ability of a vessel to restore itself to an upright position after being inclined by wind, sea, or loading conditions).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usna.edu/NAOE/academics/en342.php www.usna.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrodynamics===
[[Hydrodynamics]] concerns the flow of water around the ship's [[hull (watercraft)|hull]], [[Bow (ship)|bow]], and [[stern]], and over bodies such as [[Boat Propeller|propeller]] blades or [[rudder]], or through thruster tunnels. 
[[Ship resistance and propulsion|Resistance]] – resistance towards motion in water primarily caused due to flow of water around the hull. Powering calculation is done based on this.
[[Marine propulsion|Propulsion]] – to move the vessel through water using [[propellers]], thrusters, [[Pump-jet|water jets]], [[sail]]s etc. Engine types are mainly [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]]. Some vessels are electrically powered using [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear]] or [[solar energy]].
[[Ship motions]] – involves motions of the vessel in seaway and its responses in waves and wind.
Controllability (maneuvering) – involves controlling and maintaining position and direction of the vessel.

=== Flotation and stability ===
While atop a liquid surface a floating body has 6 degrees of freedom in its movements, these are categorized in either rotation or translation.
* Fore and aft translation is termed surge.
* Transverse translation is termed sway.
* Vertical translation is termed heave.
* Rotation about a transverse axis is termed trim or pitch.
* Rotation about a fore and aft axis is termed heel or roll.
* Rotation about a vertical axis is termed yaw.

Longitudinal stability for longitudinal inclinations, the stability depends upon the distance between the center of gravity and the longitudinal meta-center. In other words, the basis in which the ship maintains its center of gravity is its distance set equally apart from both the aft and forward section of the ship.

While a body floats on a liquid surface it still encounters the force of gravity pushing down on it. In order to stay afloat and avoid sinking there is an opposed force acting against the body known as the hydrostatic pressures. The forces acting on the body must be of the same magnitude and same line of motion in order to maintain the body at equilibrium. This description of equilibrium is only present when a freely floating body is in still water, when other conditions are present the magnitude of which these forces shifts drastically creating the swaying motion of the body.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Naval Architecture|last=Tupper|first=Eric|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=1996|isbn=|location=Oxford, England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buoyancy force is equal to the weight of the body, in other words, the mass of the body is equal to the mass of the water displaced by the body. This adds an upward force to the body by the amount of surface area times the area displaced in order to create an equilibrium between the surface of the body and the surface of the water.

The stability of a ship under most conditions is able to overcome any form or restriction or resistance encountered in rough seas; however, ships have undesirable roll characteristics when the balance of oscillations in roll is two times that of oscillations in heave, thus causing the ship to capsize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neves|first=M. A. S.|date=2016|title=Dynamic stability of ships in regular and irregular seas - An Overview|url=|journal=Ocean Engineering|volume=120|pages=362–370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Oil tanker deck.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Deck of an oil tanker, looking aft]]

===Structures===
[[Structural engineering|Structures]] involves selection of material of construction, [[structural analysis]] of global and local strength of the vessel, vibration of the structural components and structural responses of the vessel during [[Seakeeping|motions in seaway]]. Depending on the type of ship, the structure and design will vary in what material to use as well as how much of it. Some ships are made from glass reinforced plastics but the vast majority are steel with possibly some aluminium in the superstructure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The complete structure of the ship is designed with panels shaped in a rectangular form consisting of steel plating supported on four edges. Combined in a large surface area the Grillages create the hull of the ship''',''' deck, and bulkheads while still providing mutual support of the frames. Though the structure of the ship is sturdy enough to hold itself together the main force it has to overcome is longitudinal bending creating a strain against its hull, its structure must be designed so that the material is disposed as much forward and aft as possible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The principal longitudinal elements are the deck, shell plating, inner bottom all of which are in the form of grillages, and additional longitudinal stretching to these. The dimensions of the ship are in order to create enough spacing between the stiffeners in prevention of buckling. Warships have used a longitudinal system of stiffening that many modern commercial vessels have adopted. This system was widely used in early merchant ships such as the [[SS Great Eastern]], but later shifted to transversely framed structure another concept in ship hull design that proved more practical. This system was later implemented on modern vessels such as tankers because of its popularity and was then named the Isherwood system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The arrangement of the Isherwood system consists of stiffening decks both side and bottom by longitudinal members, they are separated enough so they have the same distance between them as the frames and beams. This system works by spacing out the transverse members that support the longitudinal by about 3 or 4 meters, with the wide spacing this causes the traverse strength needed by displacing the amount of force the bulkheads provide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Arrangements===
Arrangements involves [[concept design]], layout and access, [[fire protection]], allocation of spaces, [[ergonomics]] and [[Tonnage|capacity]].

===Construction===
[[Shipbuilding|Construction]] depends on the material used. When steel or aluminium is used this involves welding of the plates and profiles after [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling]], marking, [[Machining|cutting]] and [[Bending (metalworking)|bending]] as per the [[structural design]] drawings or models, followed by erection and [[Ship launching|launching]]. [[Adhesive bonding|Other joining techniques]] are used for other materials like [[fibre reinforced plastic]] and [[glass-reinforced plastic]].The process of construction is thought-out cautiously while considering all factors like safety, strength of structure, hydrodynamics, and ship arrangement. Each factor considered presents a new option for materials to consider as well as ship orientation. When the strength of the structure is considered the acts of ship collision are considered in the way that the ships structure is altered. Therefore, the properties of materials are considered carefully as applied material on the struck ship has elastic properties, the energy absorbed by the ship being struck is then deflected in the opposite direction, so both ships go through the process of rebounding to prevent further damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prabowo|first=A. R.|date=2017|title=Effects of the rebounding of a striking ship on structural crashworthiness during ship-ship collision|url=|journal=Thin-Walled Structures|volume=115|pages=225–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science and craft==
Traditionally, naval architecture has been more craft than science.  The suitability of a vessel's shape was judged by looking at a half-model of a vessel or a prototype.  Ungainly shapes or abrupt transitions were frowned on as being flawed.  This included rigging, deck arrangements, and even fixtures.  Subjective descriptors such as ungainly, full, and fine were used as a substitute for the [[Hull (watercraft)|more precise terms]] used today.  A vessel was, and still is described as having a ‘fair’ shape.  The term ‘fair’ is meant to denote not only a smooth transition from fore to aft but also a shape that was ‘right.’  Determining what is ‘right’ in a particular situation in the absence of definitive supporting analysis encompasses the art of naval architecture to this day.

Modern low-cost digital [[computers]] and dedicated [[software]], combined with extensive research to correlate full-scale, [[towing tank]] and computational data, have enabled naval architects to more accurately predict the performance of a marine vehicle. These tools are used for [[Stability conditions (watercraft)|static stability]] (intact and damaged), dynamic stability, resistance, powering, hull development, [[structural analysis]], green water modelling, and slamming analysis. Data are regularly shared in international conferences sponsored by [[Royal Institution of Naval Architects|RINA]], [[Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers|Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers (SNAME)]] and others. [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] is being applied to predict the response of a floating body in a random sea.

==The naval architect==
[[File:Naval Architect at Work.JPG|thumb|Naval architect at work]]
Due to the complexity associated with operating in a marine environment, naval architecture is a co-operative effort between groups of technically skilled individuals who are specialists in particular fields, often coordinated by a lead naval architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navalengineers.org/About/Brochure/naval_engineering.html American Society of Naval Engineers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226035256/http://www.navalengineers.org/About/Brochure/naval_engineering.html |date=December 26, 2008 }}. Naval engineering brochure.&lt;/ref&gt; This inherent complexity also means that the analytical tools available are much less evolved than those for designing aircraft, cars and even spacecraft.  This is due primarily to the paucity of data on the environment the marine vehicle is required to work in and the complexity of the interaction of waves and wind on a marine structure.

A naval architect is an [[engineer]] who is responsible for the design, construction, and/or repair of ships, boats, other marine vessels, and offshore structures, both commercial and military, including:

:* [[Merchant ship]]s – [[oil tanker]]s, [[LNG carrier|gas tankers]], [[cargo ship]]s, [[bulk carrier]]s, [[container ships]]
:* [[Ferry|Passenger/vehicle ferries]], [[cruise ship]]s
:* [[Warship]]s – [[frigate]]s, [[destroyer]]s, [[aircraft carrier]]s, amphibious ships
:* [[Submarine]]s and underwater vehicles
:* [[Icebreaker]]s
:* [[High speed craft]] – [[hovercraft]], [[catamaran|multi-hull ships]], [[hydrofoil]] craft
:* Workboats – [[barge]]s, [[fishing boat]]s, [[anchor handling tug supply vessel]]s, [[platform supply vessel]]s, [[tug boat]]s, pilot vessels, rescue craft
:* [[Yacht]]s, power boats, and other recreational watercraft
:* [[Offshore platform]]s and [[Subsea#Oil and gas|subsea]] developments
[[File:Model of Veteran Class MT46 Tanker, Florida .jpg|thumb|1/100 scale model of Veteran Class MT46 Tanker. Florida]]
Some of these vessels are amongst the largest (such as [[supertankers]]), most complex (such as [[Aircraft carriers]]), and highly valued movable structures produced by mankind. They are typically the most efficient method of transporting the world's raw materials and products. Modern engineering on this scale is essentially a team activity conducted by specialists in their respective fields and disciplines. 
Naval architects integrate these activities. This demanding leadership role requires managerial qualities and the ability to bring together the often-conflicting demands of the various design constraints to produce a product which is fit for the purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Job Family Standard for Professional Work in the Engineering and Architecture Group, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, pp. 43–45 |url=http://www.opm.gov/fedclass/gs0800P.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512122916/https://www.opm.gov/fedclass/gs0800P.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this leadership role, a naval architect also has a specialist function in ensuring that a safe, economic, environmentally sound and [[seaworthy]] design is produced. To undertake all these tasks, a naval architect must have an understanding of many branches of engineering and must be in the forefront of high technology areas. He or she must be able to effectively utilize the services provided by scientists, lawyers, accountants, and business people of many kinds.

Naval architects typically work for [[shipyard]]s, ship owners, design firms and consultancies, equipment manufacturers, [[Classification society|Classification societies]], regulatory bodies ([[Admiralty law]]), [[Navy|navies]], and governments.

The '''Newcomb Cleveland Prize''' of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) is annually awarded to author(s) of outstanding [[scientific paper]] published in the Research Articles or Reports sections of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.  Established in 1923, funded by [[Newcomb Cleveland]] who remained anonymous until his death in 1951, and for this period it was known as the '''AAAS Thousand Dollar Prize'''. "The prize was inspired by Mr. Cleveland's belief that it was the scientist who counted and who needed the encouragement an unexpected monetary award could give."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1951/08/15/archives/million-left-to-mt-holyoke-college-by-retired-advertising-executive.html|title=Million Left to Mt.

'''Niklaus Gerber''' (8 June 1850 – 9 February 1914) was a Swiss dairy chemist and industrialist. He was born in 1850 in [[Thun]], [[Switzerland]]. He attended the [[University of Bern]] and [[University of Zurich]], studied chemistry in Paris and Munich and spent 2 years at the Swiss-American Milk Co. in [[Little Falls (town), New York|Little Falls, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gerber-instruments.ch/en/geschichte.htm |title=Gerber Instruments History |accessdate=2008-08-28  |publisher=Gerber Instruments AG |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080314152713/http://www.gerber-instruments.ch/en/geschichte.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
In 1887,   Gerber founded United Dairies of Zurich. At this time, the quality of raw milk was poor due to lack of hygiene.  Further, dishonest dairymen would dilute raw milk with water and no means existed to effectively test the milk.  In 1892, Dr. Gerber developed a method of analyzing fat content in milk in a relatively fast, simple and reliable manner for the time.  Niklaus obtained a patent on this "Acid-Butyrometry," which came to be known as the "[[Gerber Method]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.db-alp.admin.ch/en/ueberuns/projekt_det.php?id=18 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20071221000142/http://www.db-alp.admin.ch/en/ueberuns/projekt_det.php?id=18 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-12-21 |title=National Reference Laboratory 2004-2005 |accessdate=2008-08-28 |author=Thomas Berger |work=Annual report 2004 |publisher=Agroscope Liebefeld-Posieux Research Station}} &lt;/ref&gt;  Although the method was originally developed for use only by United Dairies, Dr. Gerber began to sell the equipment to milk processors globally and created a separate company to commercialise the Gerber Method.

In 1904, Gerber founded the "Dr. N. Gerber's Acid-Butyrometry Ltd., Leipzig", which later merged with another entity to create "Dr. N. Gerber's m.b.H Zurich and Leipzig" to produce and develop the Gerber instruments.

Gerber died in 1914.

The Gerber method remains in wide use throughout much of the world.  The [[Babcock test]] is similar and is more widely used in the United States.

'''''Nina and the Neurons''''' is a programme shown on the [[CBeebies]] channel aimed at four to six-year-olds to help them understand basic [[science]]. Nina is a neuroscientist&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/09_september/06/scotland_kr.shtml BBC Scotland Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt; who enlists the help of five Neurons (animated characters representing the [[senses]]) in her brain to answer a scientific question.

The show is produced by Lucille McLaughlin, who has also produced the children's programmes [[Balamory]], [[Me Too! (UK TV series)|Me Too!]] and [[Bits and Bobs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|id=2662854|name=Lucille McLaughlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series is commissioned by [[CBeebies]] Controller, [[Michael Carrington (television executive)|Michael Carrington]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}.

==Synopsis==
Most of the show is based at [[Glasgow Science Centre]], with a small part taking place outdoors. At the start of the show, Nina conducts experiments in front of an unseen audience of children. At one point of the show, Nina is 'contacted' by  (usually two or three, but rarely four) children, who appears on a computer screen asking a science-related question (e.g., ‘What makes rainbows appear and disappear?’) Nina then chooses one (or more) of the five Neurons inside her brain based upon which of the [[senses]] is most appropriate to answer the question. Once the Neuron has been selected, the children (called the 'experimenters') then  visit Nina, using fun experiments and games.

Afterwards, Nina takes the children out to find out more about the answer to the question, sometimes with the help of their friends and family. After they have found out the answer to the question, they travel back to the Glasgow Science Centre to do another experiment. Then, the ‘experimenters’ leave.

At the end of each show, a song is sung, which changes from series to series depending on the theme of the series. Then, the Neurons discuss what they have done and the individual role they have played. The show ends with Nina and the Neurons bidding farewell to the viewers.

==Characters and cast==
The main character of Nina is played by Scottish actress [[Katrina Bryan]]. She is a scientist who works in the lab. Nina wears either a white [[lab coat]] with brightly coloured cuffs and lapels in her lab, or one of a bright yellow coat or blue jacket when outside. In the programme, Nina drives either a pale blue 1970s [[Volkswagen Type 2]] (Transporter) minibus or a [[Mini (marque)|New MINI]], both bearing numberplates reading 'NINA', or rides a bicycle in the Go ECO! version.

The Neurons are computer animated characters (stylised with human facial features and body, but no legs) who live inside Nina’s brain, with no legs, and are named to reflect the five [[senses]] which they represent:

'''Felix''', voiced by [[James Dreyfus]] in the first series but subsequently by [[Lewis MacLeod (actor)|Lewis MacLeod]] represents [[Somatosensory system|touch]]. He is green and speaks in a posh accent and is particular about his appearance.

'''Belle''', voiced by [[Kelly Harrison]] represents [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. She is red but also loud and can be bossy. She also the group vice leader.

'''Luke''', voiced by Patrice Naiambana, represents [[Visual perception|sight]] is yellow and is also the group leader. His character is laid back and relaxed.

'''Ollie''', voiced by [[Siobhan Redmond]] represents [[Olfaction|smell]]. She is purple and described as 'sweet, self-assured and a bit of a goth.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/grownups/about/programmes/ninaandtheneurons_02.shtml Cbbeebies Grownups] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202083731/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/grownups/about/programmes/ninaandtheneurons_02.shtml |date=2 December 2009 }} at the [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt; She is the elder sister of Bud.

'''Bud''', voiced by [[Sharon Small]] represents the [[taste]] neuron. He is blue and also the youngest Neuron and can be enthusiastic and easily excited. He is the younger brother of Ollie.

'''Bud''' and '''Ollie''' are often chosen together by Nina due to the way taste and smell work together.

'''Felix''' and '''Luke''' got chosen together by Nina due to the way touch and sight work together.

'''Belle''' and '''Luke''' got chosen together by Nina due to the way hearing and sight work together.

'''Felix''' and '''Belle''' got chosen together by Nina due to the way touch and hearing work together.

==Episodes==
The first series began on 26 February 2007 and ended on 30 March 2007. The 2nd series began airing on Cbeebies on 31 March 2008 and ended on 2 May 2008. It was followed by a third, this time called Nina and the Neurons: Go Eco!, on 13 June 2008 as part of CBeebies' year-long green initiative called EcoBeebies, which ended on 15 August 2008. A fourth series called Nina and the Neurons: Go Inventing started on 18 May 2009, where Nina invites several young inventors to her lab to discover how things work by inventing their own versions. It ended on 19 June 2009. The fifth series, Nina and the Neurons: In The Lab, was broadcast from 27 September 2010 to 10 December 2010. In the show, Nina and the experimenters discover changes and reaction.

A sixth series, called Nina and the Neurons: Brilliant Bodies, premiered on 5 September 2011. The show focuses on the parts of the human body. The seventh series, Nina and the Neurons: Go Engineering, is another series about inventions. It started in 2013. Series 8 is called Nina and the Neurons: Earth Explorers, explores the Earth, the sea and beyond. The series also started in 2013. The last three series, Get Sporty (2014), Go Digital (2015) and Get Building (2016) focus on sport, gadgets and building respectively.

'''Orgel diagrams''' are [[Correlation diagram (disambiguation)|correlation diagram]]s which show the relative energies of [[term symbol|electronic terms]] in [[transition metal]] [[coordination complex|complexes]], much like [[Tanabe–Sugano diagram]]s. They are named after their creator, [[Leslie Orgel]].  Orgel diagrams are restricted to only show weak field (i.e. [[spin states (d electrons)|high spin]]) cases, and offer no information about strong field (low spin) cases.  Because Orgel diagrams are [[qualitative data|qualitative]], no energy calculations can be performed from these diagrams; also, Orgel diagrams only show the symmetry states of the highest [[spin multiplicity]] instead of all possible terms, unlike a Tanabe–Sugano diagram.&lt;ref&gt;Housecroft, C. E.; Sharpe, A. G. (2008). Inorganic Chemistry (3rd ed.). Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|978-0-13-175553-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Orgel diagrams will, however, show the number of spin allowed transitions, along with their respective symmetry designations. In an Orgel diagram, the parent term (P, D, or F) in the presence of no ligand field  is located in the center of the diagram, with the terms due to that electronic configuration in a ligand field at each side.  There are two Orgel diagrams, one for d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, d&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, and d&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; configurations and the other with d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, d&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, and d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; configurations.

In an Orgel diagram lines with the same Russell – Saunders terms will diverge due to the [[Avoided crossing|non-crossing rule]], but all other lines will be linear.  Also, for the D Orgel diagram, the left side contains d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and d&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedral and d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and d&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; octahedral complexes.  The right side contains d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and d&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedral and d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and d&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; octahedral complexes. For the F Orgel diagram, the left side contains d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and d&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedral and d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; octahedral complexes.  The right side contains d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedral and d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and high spin d&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; octahedral complexes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26241">The '''particle-in-cell''' ('''PIC''') method refers to a technique used to solve a certain class of [[partial differential equations]].  In this method, individual particles (or fluid elements) in a [[Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates|Lagrangian]] frame are tracked in continuous [[phase space]], whereas moments of the distribution such as densities and currents are computed simultaneously on Eulerian (stationary) [[Mesh (mathematics)|mesh]] points.

PIC methods were already in use as early as 1955,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
even before the first [[Fortran]] compilers were available. The method gained popularity for plasma simulation in the late 1950s and early 1960s by [[Oscar Buneman|Buneman]], [[John M. Dawson|Dawson]], Hockney, Birdsall, Morse and others. In [[Plasma (physics)|plasma physics]] applications, the method amounts to following the trajectories of charged particles in self-consistent electromagnetic (or electrostatic) fields computed on a fixed mesh. 
&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical aspects ==

For many types of problems, the classical PIC method invented by Buneman, Dawson, Hockney, Birdsall, Morse and others is relatively intuitive and straightforward to implement.  This probably accounts for much of its success, particularly for plasma simulation, for which the method typically includes the following procedures:
* Integration of the equations of motion.
* Interpolation of charge and current source terms to the field mesh.
* Computation of the fields on mesh points.
* Interpolation of the fields from the mesh to the particle locations.

Models which include interactions of particles only through the average fields are called '''PM''' (particle-mesh). Those which include direct binary interactions are '''PP''' (particle-particle). Models with both types of interactions are called '''PP-PM''' or '''P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;M'''.

Since the early days, it has been recognized that the PIC method is susceptible to error from so-called ''discrete particle noise''.
&lt;ref&gt;

|doi=10.1016/0021-9991(72)90048-4|bibcode = 1972JCoPh..10..475O }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
This error is statistical in nature, and today it remains less-well understood than for traditional fixed-grid methods, such as [[Numerical partial differential equations|Eulerian]] or [[semi-Lagrangian scheme|semi-Lagrangian]] schemes.

Modern geometric PIC algorithms are based on a very different theoretical framework. These algorithms use tools of discrete manifold, interpolating differential forms, and canonical or non-canonical symplectic integrators to guarantee gauge invariant and conservation of charge, energy-momentum, and more importantly the infinitely dimensional symplectic structure of the particle-field system.

These desired features are attributed to the fact that geometric PIC algorithms are built on the more fundamental field-theoretical framework and are directly linked to the perfect form, i.e., the variational principle of physics.

== Basics of the PIC plasma simulation technique ==

Inside the plasma research community, systems of different species (electrons, ions, neutrals, molecules, dust particles, etc.) are investigated. The set of equations associated with PIC codes are therefore the [[Lorentz force]] as the equation of motion, solved in the so-called ''pusher'' or ''particle mover'' of the code, and [[Maxwell's equations]] determining the [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic]] fields, calculated in the ''(field) solver''.

=== Super-particles ===

The real systems studied are often extremely large in terms of the number of particles they contain. In order to make simulations efficient or at all possible, so-called ''super-particles'' are used. A super-particle (or ''macroparticle'') is a computational particle that represents many real particles; it may be millions of electrons or ions in the case of a plasma simulation, or, for instance, a vortex element in a fluid simulation. It is allowed to rescale the number of particles, because the [[Lorentz force]] depends only on the charge-to-mass ratio, so a super-particle will follow the same trajectory as a real particle would.

The number of real particles corresponding to a super-particle must be chosen such that sufficient statistics can be collected on the particle motion. If there is a significant difference between the density of different species in the system (between ions and neutrals, for instance), separate real to super-particle ratios can be used for them.

=== The particle mover ===

Even with super-particles, the number of simulated particles is usually very large (&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;), and often the particle mover is the most time consuming part of PIC, since it has to be done for each particle separately. Thus, the pusher is required to be of high accuracy and speed and much effort is spent on optimizing the different schemes.

The schemes used for the particle mover can be split into two categories, implicit and explicit solvers. While implicit solvers(e.g. implicit Euler scheme) calculate the particle velocity from the already updated fields, explicit solvers use only the old force from the previous time step, and are therefore simpler and faster, but require a smaller time step. Two frequently used schemes are the [[leapfrog method]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; which are explicit solvers.

For plasma applications, the [[leapfrog method]] takes the following form:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbf{x}_{k+1} - \mathbf{x}_{k}}{\Delta t} = \mathbf{v}_{k+1/2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbf{v}_{k+1/2} - \mathbf{v}_{k-1/2}}{\Delta t} = \frac{q}{m} \left( \mathbf{E}_k + \frac{\mathbf{v}_{k+1/2} + \mathbf{v}_{k-1/2}}{2} \times \mathbf{B}_{k} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; refers to "old" quantities from the previous time step, &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt; to updated quantities from the next time step (i.e. &lt;math&gt;t_{k+1} = t_k + \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;), and velocities are calculated in-between the usual time steps &lt;math&gt;t_k&lt;/math&gt;.

In comparison, the equations of the Boris scheme are:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_{k} + {\Delta t} \mathbf{v}_{k+1/2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_{k+1/2} = \mathbf{u}' + q' \mathbf{E}_k,&lt;/math&gt;

with 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}' = \mathbf{u} + (\mathbf{u} + (\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{h})) \times \mathbf{s},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{v}_{k-1/2} + q' \mathbf{E}_k,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h} = q' \mathbf{B}_k,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s} = 2 \mathbf{h}/(1 + h^2)&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;q' = \Delta t \times (q/2m)&lt;/math&gt;.

Because of its excellent long term accuracy, the Boris algorithm is the de facto standard for advancing a charged particle.  It was realized that the excellent long term accuracy of nonrelativistic Boris algorithm is due to the fact it conserves phase space volume, even though it is not symplectic. The global bound on energy error typically associated with symplectic algorithms still holds for the Boris algorithm, making it an effective algorithm for the multi-scale dynamics of plasmas.  It has also been shown

that one can improve on the relativistic Boris push to make it both volume preserving and have a constant-velocity solution in crossed E and B fields.

=== The field solver ===

The most commonly used methods for solving Maxwell's equations (or more generally, [[partial differential equation]]s (PDE)) belong to one of the following three categories:
* [[Finite difference method]]s (FDM)
* [[Finite element method]]s (FEM)
* [[Spectral method]]s

With the FDM, the continuous domain is replaced with a discrete grid of points, on which the [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic]] fields are calculated. Derivatives are then approximated with differences between neighboring grid-point values and thus PDEs are turned into algebraic equations.

Using FEM, the continuous domain is divided into a discrete mesh of elements. The PDEs are treated as an [[eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|eigenvalue problem]] and initially a trial solution is calculated using [[basis function]]s that are localized in each element. The final solution is then obtained by optimization until the required accuracy is reached.

Also spectral methods, such as the [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT), transform the PDEs into an eigenvalue problem, but this time the basis functions are high order and defined globally over the whole domain. The domain itself is not discretized in this case, it remains continuous. Again, a trial solution is found by inserting the basis functions into the eigenvalue equation and then optimized to determine the best values of the initial trial parameters.

=== Particle and field weighting ===

The name "particle-in-cell" originates in the way that plasma macro-quantities ([[number density]], [[current density]], etc.) are assigned to simulation particles (i.e., the ''particle weighting''). Particles can be situated anywhere on the continuous domain, but macro-quantities are calculated only on the mesh points, just as the fields are. To obtain the macro-quantities, one assumes that the particles have a given "shape" determined by the shape function
:&lt;math&gt;S(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{X}),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the coordinate of the particle and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; the observation point. Perhaps the easiest and most used choice for the shape function is the so-called ''cloud-in-cell'' (CIC) scheme, which is a first order (linear) weighting scheme. Whatever the scheme is, the shape function has to satisfy the following conditions:
&lt;ref name=Fehske&gt;{{cite book

| chapter = Chapter 6: The Particle-in-Cell Method
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
space isotropy, charge conservation, and increasing accuracy (convergence) for higher-order terms.

The fields obtained from the field solver are determined only on the grid points and can't be used directly in the particle mover to calculate the force acting on particles, but have to be interpolated via the ''field weighting'':
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i}\mathbf{E}_i S(\mathbf{x}_i-\mathbf{x}),&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; labels the grid point. To ensure that the forces acting on particles are self-consistently obtained, the way of calculating macro-quantities from particle positions on the grid points and interpolating fields from grid points to particle positions has to be consistent, too, since they both appear in [[Maxwell's equations]]. Above all, the field interpolation scheme should conserve [[momentum]]. This can be achieved by choosing the same weighting scheme for particles and fields and by ensuring the appropriate space symmetry (i.e. no self-force and fulfilling the [[Newton's laws of motion|action-reaction law]]) of the field solver at the same time&lt;ref name="Fehske"/&gt;

=== Collisions ===

As the field solver is required to be free of self-forces, inside a cell the field generated by a particle must decrease with decreasing distance from the particle, and hence inter-particle forces inside the cells are underestimated. This can be balanced with the aid of [[Coulomb collision]]s between charged particles. Simulating the interaction for every pair of a big system would be computationally too expensive, so several [[Monte Carlo method]]s have been developed instead. A widely used method is the ''binary collision model'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In a real plasma, many other reactions may play a role, ranging from elastic collisions, such as collisions between charged and neutral particles, over inelastic collisions, such as electron-neutral ionization collision, to chemical reactions; each of them requiring separate treatment. Most of the collision models handling charged-neutral collisions use either the ''direct Monte-Carlo'' scheme, in which all particles carry information about their collision probability, or the ''null-collision'' scheme,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Accuracy and stability conditions ===

As in every simulation method, also in PIC, the time step and the grid size must be well chosen, so that the time and length scale phenomena of interest are properly resolved in the problem. In addition, time step and grid size affect the speed and accuracy of the code.

For an electrostatic plasma simulation using an explicit time integration scheme (e.g. leapfrog, which is most commonly used), two important conditions regarding the grid size &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; and the time step &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; should be fulfilled in order to ensure the stability of the solution:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta x &lt; 3.4 \lambda_D,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t \leq 2 \omega_{pe}^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;

which can be derived considering the harmonic oscillations of a one-dimensional unmagnetized plasma. The latter conditions is strictly required but practical considerations related to energy conservation suggest to use a much stricter constraint where the factor 2 is replaced by a number one order of magnitude smaller. The use of &lt;math&gt;\Delta t \leq 0.1 \omega_{pe}^{-1},&lt;/math&gt; is typical.&lt;ref name=Fehske/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

For an explicit electromagnetic plasma simulation, the time step must also satisfy the [[Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition|CFL condition]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t &lt; \Delta x / c ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta x \sim \lambda_D&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light.

== Applications ==

Within plasma physics, PIC simulation has been used successfully to study laser-plasma interactions, electron acceleration and ion heating in the auroral [[ionosphere]], [[magnetohydrodynamics]], [[magnetic reconnection]], as well as ion-temperature-gradient and other microinstabilities in [[tokamak]]s, furthermore [[vacuum arc|vacuum discharges]], and [[dusty plasma]]s.

Hybrid models may use the PIC method for the kinetic treatment of some species, while other species (that are [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]]) are simulated with a fluid model.

PIC simulations have also been applied outside of plasma physics to problems in [[solid mechanics|solid]] and [[fluid mechanics]].

'''Spatial contextual awareness''' consociates contextual information such as an individual's or sensor's location, activity, the time of day, and proximity to other people or objects and devices.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;Chen, Guanling, and David Kotz. 2000. A Survey of Context-Aware Mobile Computing Research. Dartmouth Computer Science Technical Report TR2000-381.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also defined as the relationship between and synthesis of information garnered from the spatial environment&lt;ref&gt; Hemakumara,  GPTS.  and  Rainis,  R.  2018.

Available from: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327864214_Spatial_Behaviour_Modelling_of_Unauthorised_Housing_in_Colombo_Sri_Lanka [accessed Sep 27 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;, a cognitive agent, and a cartographic map.  The spatial environment is the physical space in which the orientation or wayfinding task is to be conducted; the cognitive agent is the person or entity charged with completing a task; and the map is the representation of the environment which is used as a tool to complete the task.&lt;ref name="Freska"&gt;Freksa, Christian, Alexander Klippel, and Stephan Winter. 2005. A Cognitive Perspective on Spatial Context. Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings 05491.&lt;/ref&gt;

An incomplete view of spatial contextual awareness would render it as simply a contributor to or an element of contextual awareness – that which specifies a point location on the earth.  This narrow definition omits the individual cognitive and computational functions involved in a complex geographic system.  Rather than defining the myriad of potential factors contributing to context, spatial contextual awareness defined in terms of cognitive processes permits a unique, user-centered perspective in which "conceptualizations imbue spatial structures with meaning."&lt;ref name="Freska"/&gt;

[[Context awareness]], geographic awareness, and ubiquitous cartography or Ubiquitous Geographic Information (UBGI) all contribute to the understanding of spatial contextual awareness.  They are also key elements in a map-based, [[location-based service]], or LBS.  In cases in which the user interface for the LBS is a map, cartographic design challenges must be addressed in order to effectively communicate the spatial context to the user.

Spatial contextual awareness can describe present context – the environment of the user at the present time and location, or that of a future context – where the user wants to go and what may be of interest to them in the approaching spatial environment.  Some location-based services are proactive systems which can anticipate future context.&lt;ref&gt;Mayrhofer, Rene, Harald Radi, and Alois Ferscha. 2003. Recognizing and Predicting Context by Learning from User Behavior. In ''The International Conference On Advances in Mobile Multimedia (MoMM2003)'', ed. W. Schreiner, G. Kotsis, A. Ferscha, and K. Ibrahim, volume 171, pages 25–35. Austrian Computer Society (OCG), September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Augmented reality is an application which guides a user through present and into future context by displaying spatial contextual information in their visual system as they traverse through real space.&lt;ref name="Gartner 2007a"&gt;Gartner, Georg. 2007a. Development of Multimedia – Mobile and Ubiquitous. In ''Multimedia Cartography'', ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 51-62. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous examples of LBS applications exist which require the ability to leverage spatial contextual awareness.  These applications are in demand by the general public and are examples of how maps are being used by individuals to help better understand the world and make daily decisions.&lt;ref name="Peterson 2007a"&gt;Peterson, Michael P. 2007a. Elements of Multimedia Cartography. In ''Multimedia Cartography'', ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 63-73. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context awareness==
[[Context awareness]] originated as a term from [[ubiquitous computing]] or as so-called pervasive computing which sought to deal with linking changes in the environment with computer systems, which are otherwise static.

Context is defined in multiple ways, most often with location as the cornerstone.  One source defines it as "location and the identity of nearby people and objects."   Another describes it as "location, identity, environment and time".&lt;ref name="Jiang"&gt;Jiang, Bin, and Xiaobai Yao. 2007. Location Based Services and GIS in Perspective.  In ''Location Based Services and TeleCartography'', ed. Georg Gartner, William Cartwright, and Michael P. Peterson, 27-45. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet some definitions recognize context awareness as being more inclusive than location.

Dey&lt;ref name="Dey"&gt;Dey, Anind K. 2001. Understanding and Using Context. ''Personal and Ubiquitous Computing'', Volume 5, 4-7. Springer London.&lt;/ref&gt; took this broader approach: "context is any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity, where entity means a person, place, or object, which is relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and the applications themselves."
The same author defined a system "to be context-aware if it uses context to provide relevant information and/or services to the user, in which the relevancy depends on the user's task".&lt;ref name="Dey"/&gt;

[[Image:Contextual Awareness Fig 1.png|thumb|upright=1.40|alt=Contextual Awareness Diagram|Figure 1:&lt;ref name="Li"/&gt; Contextual Awareness (Diagram after Li 2007)]]
The concept of relevancy is described in the following definition of context awareness: "the set of environmental states and settings that either determines an application's behavior or in which an application event occurs and is interesting to the user".&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt;  Different levels of context, in terms of low and high level have also been outlined.  Low-level contexts consist of time, location, network bandwidth and orientation.  A high-level context consists of the user's current activity and social context.&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt;

A three-level model of context awareness (Figure 1) includes the changeable nature of the environment by differentiating between the contributions of static, dynamic, and internal context:&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;Li, Ki-Joune. 2007. Ubiquitous GIS, Part I: Basic Concepts of Ubiquitous GIS, Lecture Slides, Pusan National University.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Static context – stored digital geographic information which could impact the user's environment
* Dynamic context – information on the changeable aspects of the user's environment obtained by sensors/info services and provided in real time (e.g. weather forecasts, traffic reports)
* Internal context  – user information, to include personal preferences, location, speed, and orientation

Static content is driven by stored information while dynamic content is provided and updated by sensors.

Context categories for mobile maps have been identified through pilot user tests.  The categories in Table 1 were deemed useful for mobile map services:&lt;ref name="Nivala"/&gt;

==Geographic awareness==
[[Image:Spatial Contextual Awareness Fig 2.png|thumb|upright=1.40|alt=Spatial Contextual Awareness Diagram|Figure 2:&lt;ref name="Li"/&gt; Spatial Contextual (or Geographic) Awareness (Diagram after Li 2007)]]
Geographic awareness, another term for spatial contextual awareness, clarifies the spatial and geographic aspects of context.  Being more than simply present location, it must also include other dimensions and their interdependencies.  Figure 2 shows Li's&lt;ref name="Li"/&gt; components of context awareness and overlays them on multiple geographic reference systems.  To be effective, an LBS application must be able to operate in a heterogeneous space which includes different reference systems.  A user of a LBS must be able to seamlessly convert from a Euclidean space (Cartesian Reference Space), to a Linear Reference Space (LRS), to indoor space (to include perhaps the floor, wing, hallway, and room number).&lt;ref name="Hong"&gt;Hong, Sang-Ki, 2008. Ubiquitous Geographic Information (UBGI) and address standards. ISO Workshop on address standards: Considering the issues related to an international address standard. 25 May 2008. Copenhagen, Denmark.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ubiquitous geographic information (UBGI)/Ubiquitous cartography==
Ubiquitous geographic information (UBGI) is geographic information which is provided at any time and any place to users or systems through communication devices.  Critical to the understanding of UBGI is that the information provided is based on the context of the user.  UBGI is more than data.  It includes a set of concepts, practices and standards for spatial and geographic information and processing for applications accessible for use by the general public.&lt;ref name="Hong"/&gt;

UBGI must also take into account the situation and goals of the user, or cognitive agent.  For that purpose, ubiquitous computing concepts employ sensors to collect data on the user's location as well as environmental parameters.&lt;ref name="Freska"/&gt;

[[Image:GI Evolution Fig 3.png|thumb|upright=1.40|alt=Evolution of Geographic Information Diagram|Figure 3:&lt;ref name="Hong"/&gt; The Evolution of Geographic Information (Diagram after Hong 2008)]]
Ubiquitous cartography is "the ability for users to create and use maps in any place and at any time to resolve geospatial problems".&lt;ref name="Gartner 2007b"&gt;Gartner, Georg. 2007b. LBS and TeleCartography: About the book.  In ''Location Based Services and TeleCartography'', ed. Georg Gartner, William Cartwright, and Michael P. Peterson, 1-11. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;  The users and creators of these maps are more than just highly trained geographers and cartographers, but include the average citizen.  In contrast to the accused elitism of the [[GIS]] community in the early 80's when many advocated for separate technology because geospatial information was different and unattainable to common users or systems, today's goal of ubiquity is to make the user experience with GIS-enabled devices intuitive and simple to use.&lt;ref name="Herring"&gt;Herring, John R. n.d. Ubiquitous Geographic Information: Releasing GI from Its Ivory Tower, Oracle Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt;  These devices and other multimedia cartography tools are playing a major role in the effort to get "maps out" to the general public and end the inexcusable practice of perfecting maps as a visualization form only for expert map users operating highly specialized [[Geographic Information Systems]].&lt;ref name="Peterson 2007a"/&gt;

The "ease-of-use" objective of ubiquitous cartography can be seen as the fourth generation in the evolution of geographic information.  UBGI was preceded by easily accessible of internet maps and the addition of contextual information of LBS and mobile mapping.  Digital geographic information was an essential precursor to accessible and mobile maps and these advancements are all an outgrowth of the first generation of paper maps and the effort to better represent and visualize the world (Fig. 3).&lt;ref name="Hong"/&gt;

==Location-based services (LBS)==
A [[location-based service]] (LBS) is an information and entertainment service, accessible with [[mobile devices]] through the [[mobile network]] and utilizing the ability to make use of the geographical position of the mobile device.

LBS services can be used in a variety of contexts, such as health, work, personal life, etc.  LBS services include services to identify a location of a person or object, such as discovering the nearest banking cash machine or the whereabouts of a friend or employee.  LBS services include parcel tracking and [[vehicle tracking]] services.  LBS can include [[mobile commerce]] when taking the form of coupons or advertising directed at customers based on their current location.  They include personalized weather services and even location-based games.  They are an example of [[telecommunication convergence]].

Location Based Services have the ability to exploit knowledge about the location of a user or an information device.  Whether the output of the device is a simple text message or an interactive graphic map, the user and the user's location are in some way incorporated into the overall system.&lt;ref name="Gartner 2007b"/&gt;

Other distinguishing characteristics of LBS include:&lt;ref name="Jiang"/&gt;
*Usually provide personalized services for a user on-the-move
*Based on diverse hardware and software platforms which utilize the internet, GIS, and location-aware devices and telecommunication services
*Receive data from various sources, sensors and systems
*Must integrate and process data in real-time
*Pose unique challenges for visualization due to the fact that the user's location could be constantly changing

LBS can be used to answer user questions which can be placed into four general categories: location, proximity, navigation, and events.  Examples include:&lt;ref name="Reichenbacher"&gt;Reichenbacher, Tumasch. 2001. The World in Your Pocket – Towards a Mobile Cartography. In Proceedings of the 20th International Cartographic Conference, August 6–10, Beijing, China, 4: 2514–2521.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Where am I?  Where is my destination?  [location]
*Where is the nearest bus stop or fast food restaurant?  [proximity]
*What is the best route to my destination?  [navigation]
*Is the latest movie showing at the local theater?  [events]

Another category is "measurement" to answer the question, how far away is my destination?&lt;ref name="Nivala"&gt;Nivala, Annu-Maaria, and L. Tiina Sarjakoski. 2003. Need for Context-Aware Topographic Maps in Mobile Devices, In ScanGIS'2003 -Proceedings of the 9th Scandinavian Research Conference on Geographical Information Science, June 4–6, Espoo, Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a routine function of personal automobile navigation devices.

New, innovative ideas continue to add to the types of questions in which LBS can answer for a user.  For example, computer vision and object based indexing can be used to both identify an object and assist a user in navigating from the location.  Spatial contextual awareness plays a key role in this process as it provides an initial geo-reference of the location while simplifying the object recognition process to a manageable degree.&lt;ref name="Luley"&gt;Luley, Patrick, Lucas Paletta, Alexander Almer, Mathias Schardt, Josef Ringert, 2007. Geo-Services and Computer Vision for Object Awareness in Mobile System Applications. In ''Location Based Services and TeleCartography'', ed. Georg Gartner, William Cartwright, and Michael P. Peterson, 291-300. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;  This category of LBS use can be called "identification" and answers the question "What is it?"

==Cartographic challenges==
Applications which require the use of spatial contextual awareness in LBS are confronted with a multitude of cartographic challenges and decisions.  Some of these challenges are due to the small displays of the typical PDA user interface and method of use.&lt;ref name="Peterson 2007b"&gt;Peterson, Michael P. 2007b. The Internet and Multimedia Cartography. In ''Multimedia Cartography'', ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 35-50. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other problems result from the large volume of potentially relevant contextual data as difficult choices need to be made on the most important content to display.&lt;ref name="Reichenbacher 2007b"&gt;Reichenbacher, Tumasch. 2007b. The concept of relevance in mobile maps. In Location Based Services and TeleCartography, ed. Georg Gartner, William Cartwright, and Michael P. Peterson, 231-246. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

A sampling of some of these challenges are:

*Mobility – A map on a mobile platform is changing quickly to keep up with context changes; limited time to view map information before a change in scene may be required.&lt;ref name="Reichenbacher 2007a"&gt;Reichenbacher, Tumasch. 2007a. Adaptation in mobile and ubiquitous cartography.  In Multimedia Cartography, ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 383-397. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Adaptation – Refers to "the ability of flexible systems to be changed by the user or the system in order to meet specific requirements."  Users must be able to personalize the display to present content adaptable to their sophistication and familiarity of the environment&lt;ref name="Reichenbacher 2007a"/&gt;
*Accessibility – "the matching of people's information and service needs with their needs and preferences in terms of intellectual and sensory engagement with that information or service, and control of it".&lt;ref name="Nevile"&gt;Nevile, Liddy, and Martin Ford. 2007. Location and Access: Issues Enabling Accessibility of Information.  In ''Multimedia Cartography'', ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 471-485. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;  A service need could include a driver who cannot take their eyes off the road to study a map display; or a visitor in a foreign country who cannot understand the language of the audible cues of a LBS provider.
*Generalization – "Due to the very small display area of mobile devices mobile maps need to be extremely generalized."  The design should simple, concise and self-evident as possible and should be instantly usable.  "This means to lower the information density following the primacy of relevance over completeness"&lt;ref name="Reichenbacher 2007a"/&gt;
*Scaling – Map display is typically very small, requiring scaling functions to show enough area and information to be useful, but at a large enough scale to adequately show detail
*Relevance – "Presenting as much info as needed and as little as required".&lt;ref name="Reichenbacher 2007b"/&gt;  The information which is "needed" is the content which is effective for the particular spatial context of the user.
*Presentation Form – Multimedia maps provide several display medium options.  The option selected should be the one which best generates the user's mental map.  Besides the visual medium of a graphic map with representative symbols, textual and vocal presentations are options to consider.&lt;ref name="Gartner and Radoczy 2007"&gt;Gartner, Georg. and Verena Radoczky. 2007c.  Maps and LBS – Supporting wayfinding by cartographic means. In Multimedia Cartography, ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 369-382. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Visual Variables – Color is an appropriate primary graphic element when portraying different type or classes of qualitative features.&lt;ref name="Robinson et al 1995"&gt;Robinson, Arthur H., Joel L. Morrison, Phillip C. Muehrcke, A. Jon Kimerling, and Stephen C. Guptill. 1995. ''Elements of Cartography'', 381. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  Color can contribute enormously to the usability of products as it assists in differentiating between different screen elements.&lt;ref&gt;Furey, Scott, and Kirk Mitchell. 2007. A Real-World implementation of Multimedia Cartography in LBS: The Whereis Mobile Application Suite. In Multimedia Cartography, ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 399-414. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;  High contrast, harmoniously matched colors need to be considered for quick perception and to reduce eye fatigue resulting from the radiant screen display&lt;ref&gt;Wintges, Theodor. 2005. Geodata Communication on Personal Digital Assistants (PDA). In ''Maps and the Internet'', ed. Michael P. Peterson, 397-402. Elsevier Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Metadata – Good metadata provides information to the user on the sources and quality of data being referenced to include reliability, accuracy, and authenticity.  More useful and higher quality metadata for multimedia applications is an omnipresent challenge.  International standards have been developed for geographic information, however, these "need to be extended and linked to information object metadata standards for photographs, videos, imagery, text, and other elements used by multimedia cartography".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, D.R. Fraser, and Tracey P. Lauriault. 2007. Future Directions for Multimedia Cartography. In ''Multimedia Cartography'', ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 505-522. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Navigation Views – The determination on best map views to aid user navigation.  Considerations include: overview maps available at various scales; automatic zoom to larger scale when user is in motion; maintain egocentric map position with north always marked.&lt;ref&gt;Radoczky, Verena. 2007. How to design a pedestrian navigation system for indoor and outdoor environments. In Location Based Services and TeleCartography, ed. Georg Gartner, William Cartwright, and Michael P. Peterson, 301-316. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

* Streamspin: Mobile services platform for delivery and receipt of information and services based on subscriber context and metadata.
* Local Location Assistant (Lol@): Prototype of a location-based multimedia service for a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System in which a foreign tourist can take a self-guided tour along a route based on user input and preferences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6708">In [[biology]], a '''tunica''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|uː|n|ᵻ|k|ə}}) (plural '''tunicae''') is a layer, coat, sheath, or similar covering. The word came to English from the [[New Latin]] of science and medicine. Its literal [[word sense|sense]] is about the same as that of the word ''[[tunic]]'', with which it is [[cognate]]. In biology one of its senses used to be the [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] name of a [[genus]] of plants, but the nomenclature has been revised and those plants are now included in the genus ''[[Petrorhagia]]''. 

In modern biology in general, ''tunica'' occurs as a technical or anatomical term mainly in [[botany]] and [[zoology]]. It usually refers to membranous structures that line or cover particular organs. In many such contexts ''tunica'' is used interchangeably with ''tunic'' according to preference. An [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] or [[organism]] that has a tunic(a) may be said to be ''tunicate'', as in a ''tunicate bulb''. This adjective ''tunicate'' is not to be confused with the noun ''[[tunicate]]'', which refers to a member of the sub[[phylum]] ''[[Tunicate|Tunicata]]''.

==Botanical and related usages==
In botany there are several contexts for the term.
*As a general, but not comprehensive, descriptive term in botanical anatomy [[John Lindley]] in the 19th century defined tunica as "any loose membranous skin not formed from epidermis".&lt;ref&gt;Lindley, John. The Treasury of Botany. Pub. William Wood 1872. May be downloaded from: [https://archive.org/details/treasurybotanya01moorgoog]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "BotGloss"&gt;Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent; Published by Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, 4th ed 1928&lt;/ref&gt;
*The apical [[meristem]], in particular in [[Angiosperm]]s, has an outer layer of cells called the tunica; its role in growth and development differs from that of the inner meristem, or ''corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;Mishra, S.R. Understanding Plant Anatomy. Publisher: Discovery  2009. {{ISBN|978-8183564571}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bulbs]] and [[corm]]s often have protective outer coverings of dead material. Particularly in fields such as horticulture and taxonomic description, such bulbs and corms are said to be "[[Wiktionary:tunicate|tunicate]]" &amp;mdash; having tunics. Usually such a tunic is derived from the bases of sacrificial dead leaves, often [[cataphyll]]s specialised for the purpose and dying in place. Such tunics may be delicate, brittle membranes such as those around the bulbs of onions, but the many variations reflect a wide range of adaptations in various species. Many of the larger Amaryllidaceae in particular, for example ''[[Boophone]]'' species, accumulate thick layers of rot-resistant leaf-base material around their bulbs. Again, corms of [[Iridaceae|Iridaceous]] species, such as some [[Watsonia (plant)|Watsonias]] and the larger species of [[Gladiolus]], accumulate thick, reticulated, fibrous or woody defences.
*More generally than in describing tunics of bulbs etc., any leaf-sheath or protective bract remaining attached to the plant after the leaf has died may be called a tunica or tunic.&lt;ref name= "BotGloss"/&gt;
*The [[Seed|testa]] or [[Wiktionary:spermoderm|spermoderm]] of a seed is sometimes called the tunic, especially in older books.&lt;ref name= "BotGloss"/&gt;
*In fungi the [[peridium]] may be referred to as the tunica.&lt;ref name= "BotGloss"/&gt;

==Zoological usages==
As an anatomical or [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] reference in zoology, ''tunica'' has a range of applications to membranous structures in anatomy, including human anatomy. Such structures are generally coverings or capsules of organs, but also may be linings of cavities. In some cases, such as the walls of macroscopic blood vessels, layers of the tissue of the walls, whether inner, intermediate, or outer, are called ''tunica'' of one kind or another. Examples follow, but neither the list nor the discussions are exhaustive.   
*In arteries and veins the inner wall is the ''[[tunica intima]]'', the outer wall is the ''[[tunica adventitia]]'', and they are separated by the ''[[tunica media]]''. More generally, the ''tunica adventitia'' or simply the "adventitia" is the outermost connective tissue covering round any internal organ.&lt;ref name= "Histol1"&gt;Junqueira, L. Carlos; Carneiro, Jose; Kelly, Robert O. Basic Histology, Publisher: Prentice Hall 1995 {{ISBN|0-8385-0590-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Tunica albuginea (disambiguation)|Tunica albuginea]]'' is a general term for a tunic of whitish connective tissue. In human anatomy it generally is applied in three contexts: the fibrous sheath of the ''[[Tunica albuginea (penis)|corpora cavernosa penis]]'', the [[Tunica albuginea of testis|fibrous tunic of the testis]], and the [[Tunica albuginea (ovaries)|connective tissue tunic]] around the ovaries.&lt;ref name= "Histol1"/&gt;
*''[[Dartos|Tunica dartos]]'' is a muscular tunic beneath the skin of the scrotum. It is one of the mechanisms for retraction of the testes, largely for temperature control.&lt;ref name= "PSHH"&gt;Amenta, Peter S. Histology: From Normal Microanatomy to Pathology. Publisher: Piccin Nuova Libraria 1997 {{ISBN|978-8829911950}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Fibrous tunic of eyeball|Tunica fibrosa oculi]]'', is the [[Fibrous tunic of eyeball|fibrous tunic of the eyeball]], the outer layer that includes both the cornea and sclera.&lt;ref name= "Histol1"/&gt;
*''[[Tunica mucosa]]'' is the predominant Latin rendering of "[[mucous membrane]]" in English-speaking countries, though ''membrana mucosa'' also is acceptable and in some European languages is preferred. The name may be qualified in referring to particular regions of the body, such as ''[[oral mucosa|tunica mucosa oris]]'' for the [[oral mucosa]], and ''[[Endometrium|tunica mucosa uteri]]'' for the [[endometrium]].&lt;ref name= "PSHH"/&gt;
*''[[Tunica muscularis]]'' refers to muscular layers in the walls of hollow organs such as the gut, where they are required for peristalsis, and sometimes for [[sphincter]]s.&lt;ref name= "PSHH"/&gt;
*''[[Tunica serosa]]'' is the [[serous membrane]]&lt;ref name= "PSHH"/&gt;
*'' [[Tunica vaginalis]]'' is the serous covering of the testis within the scrotum.&lt;ref name= "Histol1"/&gt;
*''Tunica vasculosa'' could refer to any tunic rich in blood vessels. In human anatomy it generally refers either to ''[[Tunica vasculosa lentis]]''&lt;ref&gt;Barishak, Y. Robert. Embryology of the Eye and Its Adnexae. Publisher: S Karger 2001 {{ISBN|978-3805571791}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to ''[[Tunica vasculosa testis]]''&lt;ref&gt;Shu-Xin Zhang. An Atlas of Histology. Publisher: Springer 1999 {{ISBN|978-0387949543}}&lt;/ref&gt;
