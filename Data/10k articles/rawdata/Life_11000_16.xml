      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12584">[[Image:3dultrasound 20 weeks.jpg|thumb|A 3D ultrasound of a human fetus aged 20 weeks]]
'''3D ultrasound''' is a [[medical ultrasound]] technique, often used in fetal, cardiac, trans-rectal and intra-vascular applications. 3D ultrasound refers specifically to the volume rendering of ultrasound data and is also referred to as 4D (3-spatial dimensions plus 1-time dimension) when it involves a series of 3D volumes collected over time.

When generating a 3D volume the ultrasound data can be collected in 4 common ways. Freehand, which involves tilting the probe and capturing a series of ultrasound images and recording the transducer orientation for each slice. Mechanically, where the internal linear probe tilt is handled by a motor inside the probe. Using an endoprobe, which generates the volume by inserting a probe and then removing the transducer in a controlled manner. The fourth technology is the matrix array transducer that uses beamsteering to sample points throughout a pyramid shaped volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoskins|first1=Peter|last2=Martin|first2=Kevin|last3=Thrush|first3=Abigail|title=Diagnostic ultrasound : physics and equipment|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-75710-2|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risks ==

The [[Medical ultrasound#Risks and side-effects|general risks of ultrasound]] also apply to 3D Ultrasound. Essentially ultrasound is considered safe. While other imaging modalities use radioactive dye or ionizing radiation, for example, ultrasound transducers send pulses of high frequency sound into the body and then listen for the echo.

In summary, the primary risks associated with ultrasound would be the potential heating of tissue or [[cavitation]]. The mechanisms by which tissue heating and cavitation are measured are through the standards called thermal index (TI) and mechanical index (MI). Even though the FDA outlines very safe values for maximum TI and MI it is still recommended to avoid unnecessary ultrasound imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Health|first1=Center for Devices and Radiological|title=Medical Imaging  - Ultrasound Imaging|url=https://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/RadiationEmittingProductsandProcedures/MedicalImaging/ucm115357.htm#benefitsrisks|website=www.fda.gov|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
=== Obstetrics ===
The progress of growing babies in the womb is difficult to examine as the fetuses are always in motion with rapid rate of heartbeat. So while scanning a womb, the patients need to keep their breath still so the real picture can be captured. With 3D US, the doctors can now detect the movement of fetuses in a flash of second and also take necessary step immediately. In addition to examining the position of the fetus, the problems and any abnormal behaviors in the womb can be detected like accumulation of fluid or any spine curvature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1148/radiology.211.2.r99mr02441 |pmid=10228526 |title=Fetal Abnormalities: Evaluation with Real-time-Processible Three-dimensional US—Preliminary Report |journal=Radiology |volume=211 |issue=2 |pages=441–446 |year=1999 |last1=Baba |first1=Kazunori |last2=Okai |first2=Takashi |last3=Kozuma |first3=Shiro |last4=Taketani |first4=Yuji }}&lt;/ref&gt; With 3D US and 3D surfacing the heartbeat of the fetus can also be traced enabling the doctor to outline the growth of the baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.acvd.2013.10.003 |pmid=24364911 |title=Real-time three-dimensional foetal echocardiography using a new transabdominal xMATRIX array transducer |journal=Archives of Cardiovascular Diseases |volume=107 |issue=1 |pages=4–9 |year=2014 |last1=Acar |first1=Philippe |last2=Battle |first2=Laia |last3=Dulac |first3=Yves |last4=Peyre |first4=Marianne |last5=Dubourdieu |first5=Hélène |last6=Hascoet |first6=Sébastien |last7=Groussolles |first7=Marion |last8=Vayssière |first8=Christophe }}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Cardiology ===
The application of three-dimension ultrasound in cardiac treatments has done outstanding progress in scanning and treating the heart  issues. When the 3D ultrasound technology is used to visualize the cardiac state of an individual, it is called as 3D Echocardiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1155/2017/6027029 |pmid=28459067 |pmc=5385255 |title=A Review on Real-Time 3D Ultrasound Imaging Technology |journal=BioMed Research International |volume=2017 |pages=1–20 |year=2017 |last1=Huang |first1=Qinghua |last2=Zeng |first2=Zhaozheng }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the integration of other technologies with the Ultrasound, it is now possible to track the quantitative measures like the chamber volume that occurs during the cardiac cycle. Also, it provides other useful information like tracking the blood flow, speed of contractions and expansions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=26548305 |url=http://www.eurekaselect.com/136745/article |year=2016 |last1=Pedrosa |first1=J. |title=Cardiac Chamber Volumetric Assessment Using 3D Ultrasound - A Review |journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=105–21 |last2=Barbosa |first2=D. |last3=Almeida |first3=N. |last4=Bernard |first4=O. |last5=Bosch |first5=J. |last6=d'Hooge |first6=J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the 3D Echocardiography method doctors now can easily detect the artery diseases and can finely examine the various defects. The echo applications helps to give a real-time image of the cardiac structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/eurheartj/eht350 |pmid=24126880 |title=Stress echo applications beyond coronary artery disease |journal=European Heart Journal |volume=35 |issue=16 |pages=1033–1040 |year=2013 |last1=Picano |first1=E. |last2=Pellikka |first2=P. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Surgical Guidance ===
Traditionally, with the 2D US the specific position of organs and tissues useful in surgeries could not be located especially in the oblique plane. However, with the advent of 3D US, the imaging technique has evolved manifolds enabling the surgeons to get a real-time picture of the tissues and organs and visualize the complete scan more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1118/1.4956176 |title=SU-F-T-41: 3D MTP-TRUS for Prostate Implant |journal=Medical Physics |volume=43 |issue=6Part13 |pages=3470–3471 |year=2016 |last1=Yan |first1=P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, 3D US provides surgical guidance in terms of treating transplant and cancer with its technique of rotational visualizing while scanning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1118/1.1538231 |pmid=12607840 |title=Automatic needle segmentation in three-dimensional ultrasound images using two orthogonal two-dimensional image projections |journal=Medical Physics |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=222–234 |year=2003 |last1=Ding |first1=Mingyue |last2=Cardinal |first2=H. Neale |last3=Fenster |first3=Aaron }}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology has evolved various methods like rotational scanning, slice projection, use of integrated array transducer that helps the surgeons to handle the traumatic cancer patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.wneu.2016.05.007 |pmid=27178235 |title=Intraoperative Ultrasound-Guided Resection of Gliomas: A Meta-Analysis and Review of the Literature |journal=World Neurosurgery |volume=92 |pages=255–263 |year=2016 |last1=Mahboob |first1=Syed |last2=McPhillips |first2=Rachael |last3=Qiu |first3=Zhen |last4=Jiang |first4=Yun |last5=Meggs |first5=Carl |last6=Schiavone |first6=Giuseppe |last7=Button |first7=Tim |last8=Desmulliez |first8=Marc |last9=Demore |first9=Christine |last10=Cochran |first10=Sandy |last11=Eljamel |first11=Sam }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, with the 3D US doctors can now treat various kind of tumors as every tissue can be easily diagnosed and introspected to study the defects and cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3171/2015.12.FOCUS15529 |pmid=26926063 |title=Direct navigated 3D ultrasound for resection of brain tumors: A useful tool for intraoperative image guidance |journal=Neurosurgical Focus |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=E5 |year=2016 |last1=Moiyadi |first1=Aliasgar V. |last2=Shetty |first2=Prakash }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, we see that the ultimate scanning and visualization done by 3D US has developed better ways of treating the patients with problems like cancer, tumors and transplants. 
=== Vascular Imaging ===
Blood vessels and arteries movements are not easy to track because of their distribution due to which capturing a real-time picture becomes difficult. Diagnosis is widely used in every kind of treatment and with the 3D US, it is now possible to track dynamic movement of blood cells, veins and arteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1109/ULTSYM.2014.0472 |chapter=The spatio-temporal variation of rat carotid artery bifurcation by ultrasound imaging |title=2014 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium |pages=1900–1903 |year=2014 |last1=Jin |first1=Chang-zhu |last2=Nam |first2=Kweon-Ho |last3=Paeng |first3=Dong-Guk |isbn=978-1-4799-7049-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, various types of diagnosis like measuring the diameter, diagnosing the wall between the arteries can be detected with a magnetic tracker integrated with 3D US that helps in accurate positioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3233/CH-152012 |pmid=26484714 |title=Standardized 2D ultrasound versus 3D/4D ultrasound and image fusion for measurement of aortic aneurysm diameter in follow-up after EVAR |journal=Clinical Hemorheology and Microcirculation |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=249–260 |year=2016 |last1=Pfister |first1=Karin |last2=Schierling |first2=Wilma |last3=Jung |first3=Ernst Michael |last4=Apfelbeck |first4=Hanna |last5=Hennersperger |first5=Christoph |last6=Kasprzak |first6=Piotr M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; So the technology gives imaging assistance and also has a sensor that helps in tracking the position of vessels in operations. 
=== Regional anesthesia ===
Real-time three-dimensional ultrasound is used during peripheral nerve blockade procedures to identify relevant anatomy and monitor the spread of local anesthetic around the nerve.  Peripheral nerve blockades prevent the transmission of pain signals from the site of injury to the brain without deep sedation, which makes them particularly useful for outpatient orthopedic procedures.  Real-time 3D ultrasound allows muscles, nerves and vessels to be clearly identified while a needle or catheter is advanced under the skin.  3D ultrasound is able to view the needle regardless of the plane of the image, which is a substantial improvement over 2D ultrasound.  Additionally, the image can be rotated or cropped in real time to reveal anatomical structures within a volume of tissue.  Physicians at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville have been developing techniques using real time 3D ultrasound to guide peripheral nerve blocks for shoulder, knee, and ankle surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Real-Time 3-D Ultrasound Speeds Patient Recovery |publisher=Mayo Clinic |date=July 13, 2007 |url=http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/531514/ |accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1213/01.ane.0000265439.02497.a7 |pmid=17578987 |title=Real-Time Three-Dimensional Ultrasound for Continuous Popliteal Blockade: A Case Report and Image Description |journal=Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=272–274 |year=2007 |last1=Feinglass |first1=Neil G. |last2=Clendenen |first2=Steven R. |last3=Torp |first3=Klaus D. |last4=Wang |first4=R Doris |last5=Castello |first5=Ramon |last6=Greengrass |first6=Roy A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AIBO''' (''stylized aibo, Artificial Intelligence Robot'', homonymous with {{Nihongo||[[wikt:相棒|相棒]]|aibō}}, "pal" or "partner" in Japanese) is a series of [[robotic pet]]s designed and manufactured by [[Sony]]. Sony announced a prototype Aibo in mid-1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press_Archive/199806/98-052/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sony.net%2FSonyInfo%2FNews%2FPress_Archive%2F199806%2F98-052%2F&amp;date=2013-01-14 |archivedate=2013-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first consumer model was introduced on May 11, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press_Archive/199905/99-046/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sony.net%2FSonyInfo%2FNews%2FPress_Archive%2F199905%2F99-046%2Findex.html&amp;date=2013-01-14 |archivedate=2013-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; New models were released every year until 2006. Although most models were dog-like, other inspirations included lion-cubs and space explorer, and only the ERS-7 version and ERS-1000 versions was explicitly a "robotic dog".&lt;ref name="pcmag.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ulanoff |first=Lance |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1240970,00.asp |title=Surprise!

In 2006, AIBO was added into the [[Carnegie Mellon University]] [[Robot Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robothalloffame.org/inductees/06inductees/aibo.html|title=2006 Inductees|date=|publisher=The Robot Hall of Fame|accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 26, 2006 Sony announced that it would discontinue AIBO and several other products in an effort to make the company more profitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/info/presen/05q3/qfhh7c000008adfe.html |title=Sony Global - Q3 FY2005 Sony Group Earnings Announcement |publisher=Sony.net |date=2006-01-26 |accessdate=2013-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516161052/http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/info/presen/05q3/qfhh7c000008adfe.html |archivedate=2013-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony's AIBO customer support was withdrawn gradually, with support for the final ERS-7M3 ending in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonydigital-link.com/AIBO/4_0_support_breakdown.asp |title=Sony AIBO Europe - Official Website - Model-by-model breakdown |publisher=Sonydigital-link.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In July 2014, Sony stopped providing repairs for AIBO products and did not provide customer support or repair for AIBO robots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zasshi.news.yahoo.co.jp/article?a=20140728-00000008-sasahi-sci |title=ＡＩＢＯ、君を死なせない 修理サポート終了「飼い主」の悲しみ〈ＡＥＲＡ〉 （dot.） |publisher=Yahoo!ニュース |date= |accessdate=2014-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729043600/http://zasshi.news.yahoo.co.jp/article?a=20140728-00000008-sasahi-sci |archivedate=2014-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

AIBO grew out of Sony's Computer Science Laboratory (CSL). Founded in 1990, CSL was set up to emulate the famed innovation center at [[PARC (company)|Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)]]. CSL's first product was the Aperios operating system, later to form the base software some AIBO models used. When [[Nobuyuki Idei]] became president of Sony in 1995, he sought to adopt a digital agenda, reflected in the new motto he gave the company, “Digital Dream Kids,” and the prominence he gave to CSL.&lt;ref name="technologyreview.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnstone |first=Bob |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/400610/california-dreamin-sony-style/ |title=California Dreamin' Sony Style &amp;#124; MIT Technology Review |publisher=Technologyreview.com |date=2000-01-01 |accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Two AIBO Prototypes and transparent ERS-7.jpg|thumb|Two AIBO Prototypes and transparent ERS-7]]
Famed engineer Dr. [[Toshitada Doi]] is credited as AIBO’s original progenitor: in 1994 he had started work on robots with artificial intelligence expert Masahiro Fujita within CSL. Fujita would write that the robot's behaviors will need to “be sufficiently complex or unexpected so that people keep an interest in watching or taking care of it”.&lt;ref&gt;[Fujita, M. &amp; Kitano, H. (1998). Development of an autonomous quadruped robot for robot entertainment. Autonomous Robots, 5, 7-20.]&lt;/ref&gt; Fujita argued that entertainment robots might be viable as "A robot for entertainment can be effectively designed using various state-of-the-art technologies, such as speech recognition and vision, even though these technologies may not be mature enough for applications where they perform a critical function. While there exists special and difficult requirements in entertainment applications themselves, limited capabilities in the speech and vision systems may turn out to be an interesting and attractive feature for appropriately designed entertainment robots." His early monkey-like prototype "MUTANT" included behaviors that would become part of AIBOs including tracking a yellow ball, shaking hands, karate strikes and sleeping. Fujita would later receive the IEEE Inaba Technical Award for Innovation Leading to Production for "AIBO, the world's first mass-market consumer robot for entertainment applications".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieee-ras.org/awards-recognition/society-awards/69-awards-recognition/society-awards/59-ieee-inaba-technical-award-for-innovation-leading-to-production |title=IEEE Inaba Technical Award for Innovation Leading to Production - IEEE Robotics and Automation Society |publisher=Ieee-ras.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A friend of Doi's, the artist [[Hajime Sorayama]], was enlisted to create the initial designs for the AIBO's body.&lt;ref name="This Cute Little Pet Is a Robot" /&gt;  Those designs are now part of the permanent collections of [[Museum of Modern Art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=82163|title=The Collection &amp;#124; Hajime Sorayama and Sony Corporation, company design.

In 1997 Doi received backing from Idei to form Sony’s Digital Creatures Lab.&lt;ref name="This Cute Little Pet Is a Robot"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/1999-05-23/this-cute-little-pet-is-a-robot |title=This Cute Little Pet Is a Robot |newspaper=Business Week |date=24 May 1999 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Dn8AJpol?url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/1999-05-23/this-cute-little-pet-is-a-robot |archivedate=19 January 2013 |accessdate=19 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that robots would be commonplace in households by 2010, but aware of the shortcomings of available technology for functional uses, he decided to focus on robots for entertainment. The AIBO responded to over 100 voice commands and talked in a tonal language. Two of the first generation AIBOs exported into the USA came to New York, NY and one remains in the archives and display at Artspace Company Y LLC.

Later models of AIBOs were designed jointly with prestigious Japanese designers, and continued to gain design awards. The ERS-210 design was inspired by lion cubs.  The bodies of the "ERS-3x" series (Latte and Macaron, the round-headed AIBOs released in 2001) were designed by visual artist Katsura Moshino winning the "Good Design Award"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g-mark.org/award/describe/27471?token=IaLMoVwUvZ|title=エンタテインメントロボット AIBO [ERS-300シリーズ"ラッテ＆マカロン"&amp;#93; &amp;#124; 受賞対象一覧 &amp;#124; Good Design Award|date=|publisher=G-mark.org|language=ja|accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sleek and futuristic, space-exploration inspired body of the "ERS-220" was designed by [[Shoji Kawamori]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plasticpals.com/?p=7957|title=• AIBO ERS-220|date=2013-01-24|publisher=Plasticpals.com|accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; winning the "Good Design Award"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g-mark.org/award/describe/27470?token=IaLMoVwUvZ|title=エンタテインメントロボット AIBO [ERS-220&amp;#93; &amp;#124; 受賞対象一覧 &amp;#124; Good Design Award|date=|publisher=G-mark.org|language=ja|accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "Design for Asia" award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfaaward.com/2012/page/kr/winners/2003.php|title=Design for Asia Award 2012|date=|publisher=Dfaaward.com|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130215195018/http://www.dfaaward.com/2012/page/kr/winners/2003.php|archive-date=2013-02-15|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ERS-7 Also won a "Good Design Award".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g-mark.org/award/describe/28437?token=IaLMoVwUvZ|title=エンターテインメントロボット [AIBO ERS-7&amp;#93; &amp;#124; 受賞対象一覧 &amp;#124; Good Design Award|date=|publisher=G-mark.org|language=ja|accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost ten years later, Idei's successor, [[Howard Stringer]] closed down AIBO and other robotic projects. Doi then staged a mock funeral, attended by more than 100 colleagues from Sony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Shea, Michael |url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/tech/features/whokilledaibo |title=Who Killed AIBO the Robotic Dog? |date=27 July 2015 |publisher=[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]] |accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the funeral, Doi said that the Aibo was a symbol of a risk-taking spirit at Sony that was now dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117285593145024927 |title=Caught between two worlds, the Sony chief tightens his management grip.

In November 2017, Sony Corporation announced that AIBO would return with a new model that would be capable of forming an emotional bond with users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201711/17-105E/index.html|title=Entertainment Robot "aibo" Announced|website=Sony Global - Sony Global Headquarters|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==

===Prototypes===
Several prototypes have been displayed by Sony. Early models were insect-like with six legs. The specifications and design of the 1998 prototype, described in a Sony press release, closely match those of the first generation AIBOs. Differences include the use of PC-Cards for memory (rather than MemoryStick media), the use of two batteries, and the option to use a 2-wheeled "rolling module" in place of legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press_Archive/199806/98-052/|title=WebCite query result|website=www.webcitation.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-15|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press_Archive/199806/98-052/&amp;date=2013-01-14|archivedate=2013-01-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Requires an always-on internet connection to function fully and comes with an LTE SIM card and monthly subscription service to support interaction and learning in the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aibo.sony.jp/feature/basic.html?s_pid=jp_aibo_/store/_basic_detail|title=aiboベーシックプラン {{!}} aibo|website=aibo.sony.jp|language=ja|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===QRIO===
[[File:QRIO watch AIBOs at Robocup.jpg|thumb|QRIOs watch AIBOs at a Robocup event]]

The humanoid [[QRIO]] robot was designed as the successor to AIBO, and runs the same base R-CODE and Aperios operating system.

==Hardware==
The initial ERS-110 AIBO's hardware includes a 64-bit RISC processor, 16 megabytes of RAM, sensors (touch, camera, range-finder, microphone, acceleration, angular velocity), a speaker and actuators (legs, neck, mouth, tail).&lt;ref name="sony.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press_Archive/199905/99-046/index.html |title=Sony Global - Press Release - Sony Launches Four-Legged Entertainment Robot "AIBO" Creates a New Market for Robot-Based Entertainment |publisher=Sony.net |date=1999-05-11 |accessdate=2013-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sony.net%2FSonyInfo%2FNews%2FPress_Archive%2F199905%2F99-046%2Findex.html&amp;date=2013-01-14 |archivedate=2013-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the series developed, more sensors and actuators were added. Wi-Fi was available as an add on for some second-generation AIBOs. The third and final family of AIBOs, the ERS-7s, have multiple head and body sensors, clicking ear actuators, a chest-mounted proximity sensor, expressive "Illume-Face" and Wi-Fi.

All AIBOs were bundled with accessories including a charging station and pink ball toy. Late model ERS7's were bundled with a pink AIBone bone-shaped toy, playing cards and a charging station with pole and marker mat for autonomous docking.

==Software==
All AIBOs are bundled with AIBOLife software giving the robot a personality, the ability to walk, "see" its environment via camera and recognize spoken commands (English and Spanish, or Japanese). AIBO's sounds were programmed by Japanese DJ/avant-garde composer [[Nobukazu Takemura]], fusing mechanic and organic concepts.&lt;ref name=WP&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/100935792.html?dids=100935792:100935792&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+20%2C+2002&amp;author=Joshua+Klein&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=Nobukazu+Takemura%2C+Synthesizing+Things+Up&amp;pqatl=google Nobukazu Takemura, Synthesizing Things Up] ''[[Washington Post]]'', January 20, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  The sounds in ERS-7 Mind and custom data were composed by [[Masaya Matsuura]], a Japanese musician and game designer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonydigital-link.com/AIBO/2_0_interview.asp |title=Sony AIBO Europe - Official Website - AIBO News |publisher=Sonydigital-link.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aperios and Open-R===
Aperios is Sony's Proprietary Real-Time Operating system, used in all AIBOs, QRIO and some other consumer devices. Aperios OS was intended to be widely deployed using revolutionary real-time capabilities to handle multiple audio and visual data streams concurrently&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.11/sony_pr.html |title=Wired 7.11: Sony's Plan for World Recreation |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operating system was not widely adopted, and by 2003 Sony had stopped active development with COO Kunitake Ando commenting "Aperios was an operating system of a pre-Internet age and we decided that it isn't adequate for the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eetimes.com/electronics-news/4137118/Linux-and-TV-called-key-to-broadband-tsunami |title=Linux and TV called key to broadband tsunami |publisher=Eetimes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OPEN-R architecture is specific to entertainment robots. The architecture involves the use of modular hardware components, such as appendages that can be easily removed and replaced to change the shape and function of the robots, and modular software components that can be interchanged to change their behavior and movement patterns.  AIBO's creator, Doi, called OPEN-R the ''masterpiece'' of the AIBO development project, arguing it would minimize the need for programming individual movements or responses, and its "open" nature would encourage a global community of robot specialists and programmers to add capability.&lt;ref name="This Cute Little Pet Is a Robot"/&gt;

===AIBOware===
First and second generation models of AIBO can load different software packages sold by Sony. AIBOware (a trademark of Sony corporation) is the title given to the [[software]] the AIBO runs on its pink [[Memory Stick]].  The ''Life'' AIBOware allows the [[robot]] to be raised from pup to fully grown adult while going through various stages of development as its owner interacts with it. The ''Explorer'' AIBOware allows the owner to interact with a fully mature robot able to understand (though not necessarily willing to obey) 100 voice commands. Without AIBOware, AIBOs run in "clinic mode" and can only perform basic actions.

Third generation ERS-7 models have a sole "Mind" software that includes capabilities of AIBOLife and other AIBOware packages. Mind software also includes a docking process, allowing ERS-7's to recharge autonomously. Upgrades in Mind2 included the AIBO Entertainment Player, a Wi-Fi based connection to a PC. Upgrades in Mind3 included speech, blogging and autonomous room mapping.

AIBO's complete vision system uses the [[Scale-invariant feature transform|SIFT]] algorithm, to recognise its charging station.  The vision system is an implementation of [[Evolution Robotics]] ERVision.

===AIBO Software Development Environment===

Initially, access to programming capabilities was limited to Sony and organizations participating in Robocup. By reverse-engineering AIBO, users developed their own software that operated together with AIBOware such as "DiscoAibo" which made the robotic canine dance to music.

In a significant copyright milestone, Sony invoked the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] in October 2001, and sent a cease-and-desist notice demanding that "Aibopet" stop distributing code that was retrieved by bypassing the [[copy protection]] mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chillingeffects.org/anticircumvention/notice.cgi?NoticeID=24 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091014133659/http://www.chillingeffects.org/anticircumvention/notice.cgi?NoticeID=24 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-10-14 |title=No New Tricks for Robot Dog - Chilling Effects Clearinghouse |publisher=Classic-web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harmon |first=Amy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/05/technology/05AIBO.html |title=Sony Tightens Leash on Its Robotic Dog |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=2001-11-05 |accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.eff.org/wp/unintended-consequences-under-dmca |title=Unintended Consequences: Twelve Years under the DMCA &amp;#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date=2010-03-03 |accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the face of complaints by many outraged AIBO owners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Farhad Manjoo |url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2001/11/48088 |title=Aibo Owners Biting Mad at Sony |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony backed down and subsequently released a programmer's kit for "non-commercial" use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sony Corporation|title=OPEN-R Architecture Specifications To Be Made Public|url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/200205/02-017E/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kit was eventually expanded into three distinct tools:  R-CODE, the OPEN-R SDK and the AIBO Remote Framework (ERS-7 only). These three tools are combined under the name AIBO Software Development Environment.  All of these tools were free to download and could be used for commercial or non-commercial use (Except for the OPEN-R SDK, which is specifically for non-commercial use).

====OPEN-R SDK====
The OPEN-R SDK is a C++ based programming SDK, based on open-source tools (like gcc and newlib), that allows you to make software that executes on your AIBO. This SDK is considered low-level and allows you to control everything from the gain values of AIBO's actuators to retrieving AIBO's camera data and doing computer vision computations. No pre-built "standard" AIBO functionality is provided, such as it is with R-Code and AIBO Remote Framework. It is an excellent choice for researchers doing low-level robotic research.

====R-CODE and R-CODE plus====
R-Code is a high-level scripting language for AIBO. R-Code allows you to very easily create simple programs for AIBO to execute. While it does not allow the low-level control that the OPEN-R SDK has, what it lacks in power it makes up for in simplicity. Remoting is possible via a simple terminal socket connection via WiFi. Commercial usage is allowed, and the license fee is free.

R-CodePlus is a derivative of R-Code by AiboPet with several added functionalities. R-CodePlus is a superset of R-Code in terms of language, so everything written in standard R-Code will work on a R-CodePlus memorystick (for the same Model AIBO). R-CodePlus exposes some new "basic" AIBO functions such as simple face recognition, name registration, and camera adjustment settings. In addition to the standard R-Code terminal socket for remoting, R-CodePlus supplies a "Telemety" socket for several binary data transfers such as AIBO's camera image and sending/receiving sound. R-CODE has been extended to R-CODE plus by Aibopet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aibohack.com/rcode/rcp_overview.htm |title=[AiboHack&amp;#93; AiboPet R-CODE Extensions |publisher=Aibohack.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aibnet offers a development environment for R-Code programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=DogsBody |url=http://www.dogsbodynet.com/aibnet.html |title=Aibnet Telnet Console |publisher=Dogsbodynet.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simplified drag-and-drop customizing of behavior is available via the user-created YART ("Yet Another RCode Tool ")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aibohack.com/rcode/yart.htm |title=[AiboHack&amp;#93; YART = Yet Another R-Code Tool |publisher=Aibohack.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== AIBO Remote Framework ====

Remotely access capabilities of AIBO MIND including behaviors and pattern recognition from a Windows PC. Same functionality used in the Aibo Entertainment Player. The AIBO Remote Framework is a Windows PC API based on Visual C++. The Framework can be used to write code that can remotely control an AIBO running MIND2 or MIND3 Aiboware via a wireless LAN. Commercial usage is allowed, and the license fee is free.

===Other Development Environments===
Several robot software development frameworks have been developed that support AIBOs, including [[URBI]], Tekkotsu,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tekkotsu.org/about.html|title=About Tekkotsu|last=|first=|date=2010|website=www.tekkotsu.org|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Python Robotics|Pyro]].

===Current Projects===

AiBO+ is a replacement personality for Sony ERS-7. The project provides an AEP-like application (AiBO+ Client) to connect to the robot under Ubuntu Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, iOS and Android. The owner can control the dog, play a game and see the robot state.&lt;ref name="aiboplus.sourceforge.net"/&gt;

AIBO Control allows Android users to control AIBO ERS-7's running URBI.&lt;ref name="play.google.com"/&gt;

The Open-R and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] based [[toolchain]] has been updated by the community to use GCC 5.4, [[GNU Binutils|Binutils]] 2.24 and [[Newlib]] 1.15. This improvement brings the latest C++11/C++14 features and modern software to program the robot. The packaged version of the old and updated AIBO toolchain is available for [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] in a [[Personal Package Archive|PPA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://launchpad.net/~csaba-kertesz/+archive/aiboplus |title=Ubuntu PPA with Aibo toolchain |publisher=Launchpad.net |date= |accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AIBOs in Education and Academia==
[[File:Robocup 2005 Aibos.jpg|thumb|Penalty shootout]]
AIBO's were used extensively in education. For example, Carnegie Mellon offered an AIBO-centred robotics course covering models of perception, cognition, and action for solving problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/15-491/ |title=15-491 Fall 2008 |publisher=Classic-web.archive.org |date=2010-07-25 |accessdate=2013-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725050329/http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/15-491/ |archivedate=July 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robotbenchmark&lt;ref name="robotbenchmark"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://robotbenchmark.net | title=robotbenchmark | accessdate=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; also features an online simulation challenge based on an Aibo ERS-7 model called "Visual Tracking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://robotbenchmark.net/benchmark/visual_tracking/ | title=robotbenchmark visual tracking | accessdate=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RoboCup Four-Legged League===
[[File:Aibos playing football at Robocup 2005.jpg|thumb|250px|AIBO robots playing in the 9th RoboCup in Osaka (2005)]]
The AIBO has seen much use as an inexpensive platform for [[artificial intelligence]] education and research, because it integrates a computer, [[Computer vision|vision system]], and articulators in a package vastly cheaper than conventional research robots. One focal point for that development has been the Robocup Leagues.

The Four-Legged League was the initial name for the [[RoboCup Standard Platform League]], a robot soccer league in which all teams compete with identical robots. The robots operate fully autonomously, with no external control by humans nor computers.  The specific AIBO version changed over time: ERS-110s (1999,2000), ERS-210 (2001-2002),  ERS-210A SuperCore (2003), ERS-7 (2004-2008).  The replacement and current standard platform is the humanoid [[Nao (robot)|NAO]] by Aldebaran Robotics.

Sony provided AIBOs, support and sponsorship to universities around the world to participate in the [[RoboCup]] autonomous [[soccer]] [[:Category:Robotics competitions|competition]]  Four-Legged Robot Soccer League. Competing teams would [[Computer program|program]] a team of AIBO robots to play games of autonomous robot soccer against other competing teams.  The Four-Legged League ran from 1999 to 2008, although in the final year, many big-name universities did not compete as they had moved to the new [[Nao (robot)|NAO]] platform.  The University of New South Wales&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~robocup/2010site/ |title=rUNSWift 2010 |publisher=Cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the most successful team in the League, making the final six times and winning three times.

==International AIBO Convention==
The International AIBO Convention takes place every year at Sony Robotics Tower in the Shinjuku prefecture. The first convention took place in 1999, on May 15. It was then set to May 2 to May 4. The 2009 convention, being in its tenth year, set attendance records. The convention usually features AIBO advertisements, free posters, free accessories, freeware/open-source downloads and "AIBO Shows".

==Anime==
The AIBO anime {{Nihongo|''Piroppo''|ピロッポ}} was based around AIBO ERS-300s, Latte, and Macaroon. The anime triggered sounds and actions from viewer's ERS-300s.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ja:AIBO]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 23-episode series was broadcast on Fuji TV on Thursdays from 22:54 to 23:00 from October 11, 2001, to March 21, 2002.

==In popular culture==
When AIBO was introduced, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' published a cartoon by [[Jack Ziegler]] showing AIBO "urinating" nuts and bolts on a fire hydrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=retailerId0cfb7871 view productId8543509 |url=https://condenaststore.com/featured/new-yorker-may-31st-1999-jack-ziegler.html |title=Sony-type robot mechanical dog urinates nuts and bolts on fire hydrant. - New Yorker Cartoon Poster Print by Jack Ziegler at the Condé Nast Collection |publisher=Condenaststore.com |date=1999-05-31 |accessdate=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIBO ERS-210 was used in [[Janet Jackson]]'s "[[Doesn't Really Matter]]" music video, and received increased market demand and commercial success after being featured with Jackson in the clip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2001/01/03/business/let-aibo-tell-you-about-brand-image/|title=Let Aibo tell you about brand image - The Japan Times|work=Japan Times|publisher=Gilhooly, Rob|date=2007|accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an episode of ''[[Frasier]]'', Frasier gives his dad an AIBO ERS-210 to keep him company while he is visiting Roz in Wisconsin. There is a scene with Eddie interacting with the AIBO, while Martin Crane complains to Sony about not being able to get it to work.

In the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Red Sleigh Down]]", Cartman spends nearly the entire episode trying to get on Santa's nice list, so that he can receive a HAIBO robot doll for Christmas, in reference to the robot dog craze of the early 2000s started by AIBO. At the episode's conclusion, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman all receive their own HAIBO dog.

When [[Siri]] on an [[iOS]] device is asked "Do you have a pet?", one of the responses is "I used to have an AIBO. But it turned on me."

In the film ''[[CJ7]]'', the robotic toy ''CJ1'', is probably based on the design of AIBO.

In the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[Jurassic Bark]]", Bender is seen with a robotic dog resembling an AIBO named Robo-Puppy.

A pair of robotic dogs similar in appearance to AIBO appear in ''[[Tokyo Jungle]]'', a video game published by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]].

An AIBO ERS-210 can be seen in the title sequence of the 2017 TV adaptation of [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[American Gods]]''.

'''Amplitude integrated electroencephalography (aEEG)''' or '''cerebral function monitoring (CFM)''' is a technique for monitoring brain function in [[intensive care]] settings over longer periods of time than the traditional [[electroencephalogram|electroencephalogram (EEG)]], typically hours to days. By placing electrodes on the [[scalp]] of the patient, a trace of electrical activity is produced which is then displayed on a [[semilogarithmic]] graph of peak-to-peak [[amplitude]] over time; amplitude is [[logarithm]]ic and time is linear. In this way, trends in electrical activity in the [[cerebral cortex]] can be interpreted to inform on events such as [[seizures]] or suppressed brain activity.&lt;ref name="prior"&gt;Maynard D, Prior P, Scott D. Device for continuous monitoring of cerebral activity in resuscitated patients. ''Br Med J''. 1969 Nov 29;4(5682):545-6. {{PMID|5354856}} [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1630343/]&lt;/ref&gt; aEEG is useful especially in [[neonatology]] where it can be used to aid in diagnosis of [[neonatal encephalopathy|hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)]], and to monitor and diagnose seizure activity.

==Interpretation of the aEEG==

The CFM readout offers an integrated trace in one pane and a non-integrated trace in another pane (see image). Modern machines give a readout for each [[cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] corresponding to the positions of electrodes placed on the patient's head. The characteristics of the CFM include the 'baseline' which should be more than 5 µV, the upper limit of the trace which should be more than 10 µV, and the presence of '[[sleep wake cycle|sleep wake cycling]]' whereby the trace is expected to narrow and broaden over time. Seizures appear on the trace as regions of high activity with a raised and compacted trace in the aEEG pane; this would correspond to high-amplitude, repetitive waveforms in the non-integrated pane. A low-amplitude or 'suppressed' trace is prognostically concerning as it indicates abnormally low brain activity. A further possible pattern is a '[[burst suppression]]' trace which consists of a low-amplitude signal interspersed with periods of high activity on the aEEG readout. This also carries a poor prognosis.&lt;ref name="TOBY"&gt;Azzopardi D. TOBY Cerebral Function Monitoring: Addition to CFM handbook for users of the Olympic CFM 6000. Imperial College London, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], under her leadership, the [[nun]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of the monastery sheltered 17 young Jewish activists from [[Vilnius Ghetto]] and helped the [[Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye|Jewish Partisan Organization (FPO)]] by smuggling weapons. In recognition of this, in 1984 she was awarded the title of [[Polish Righteous among the Nations|Righteous among the Nations]] by [[Yad Vashem]].

==Hiding Jews==
[[Image:Lucianarni.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Patron Saint of [[Dominican Sisters]], [[Lucia Brocadelli of Narni|Blessed Lucy]], in Dominican [[religious habit|habit]]]]

Vilnius (Vilna) was taken over by the Germans on 24 June 1941, in [[Operation Barbarossa]], and the killing of the Jews began almost immediately. Mother Betranda first inquired about saving Jews following the start of the [[Ponary massacre]] in July 1941. She initially sought to gain the support of the Wilno Catholic leadership, but they rebuffed her efforts out of fear that the [[Nazi German]] occupation forces would destroy church property and kill any Christians found to be aiding Jews.&lt;ref name="DCG"&gt;{{cite book|first=David C.|last=Gross|title=The Jewish People's Almanac|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nUgkCz73jPkC&amp;q=Borkowska|place=Garden City, New York|publisher=''Doubleday &amp; Company''|year=1981|pages=465–66|isbn=0385156529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acting on her own initiative, Mother Betranda then took in 17 members of [[Hashomer Hatzair]], a local [[Zionist]] group, and hid them within the grounds of her monastery. The activists included [[Abba Kovner]], the movement's leader, [[Abraham Sutzkever]], Arie Wilner and Edek Boraks. They helped the nuns with working their fields, while Kovner, realizing the goals of Hitler's [[Final Solution]], worked on organizing a political resistance to the occupation and writing his manifesto for the later uprising.&lt;ref name="YV"/&gt; When several of her nuns objected, Mother Bertranda reportedly threatened them with expulsion from the monastery and excommunication from the faith. Some of the Hashomer Hatzair members later decided to leave their monastery hideout and to return to the Jewish Ghetto in Vilnius, where they organized an underground resistance movement, the ''[[Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye]]'' (FPO).&lt;ref name="DCG"/&gt;

==Helping Jewish resistance==
Soon after that, Mother Bertranda left the monastery and went to the Ghetto to volunteer her services.&lt;ref name="YV"/&gt; She was dissuaded from this by Kovner, who asked that she organize the procurement of supplies instead. She and the other Dominican nuns then took it upon themselves to help the Jewish resistance by smuggling in arms and ammunition. The other nuns of the community included Sister Bernadeta (Julia Michrowska), Sister Cecylia (Maria Roszek), Sister Diana (Helena Frackiewicz), Sister Imelda (Maria Neugebauer), Sister Jordana (Maria Ostrejko), Sister Małgorzata (Irena Adamek) and Sister Stefania (Stanisława Bednarska). In this they became among the first to supply hand grenades and other weapons to the [[Vilnius Ghetto]] underground.&lt;ref name="MP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kpk-toronto.org/archives/clergy_rescue_saving_jews.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820181501/http://www.kpk-toronto.org/archives/clergy_rescue_saving_jews.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 August 2013 |last=Paul |first=Mark |title=Wartime Rescue of Jews by the Polish Catholic Clergy: The Testimony of Survivors |publisher=''Polish Educational Foundation in North America'' |year=2009 |accessdate=25 November 2012 |format=PDF file, direct download 1.21 MB }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between August and September 1943, the ghetto was liquidated and some 12,000 men, women and children were deported to camps in [[Estonia]]. The uprising, organized by FPO on 1 September 1943 was crushed. The final Nazi destruction of whatever remained of the Ghetto followed.

In September 1943, Mother Bertranda was arrested by the Nazi German occupation authorities and sent to a labor camp at Perwejniszki near Kovno ({{lang-pl|Kowno}}, now Pravieniškės near [[Kaunas]], Lithuania).&lt;ref name=Kovno group=nb/&gt; The monastery was closed and the community of nuns was forced to disperse. After the war, Mother Bertranda asked for a [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] from her vows and left the monastery, where she adopted the name Anna Borkowska.&lt;ref name="spraw" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Porat"&gt;{{cite book|author=Porat, Dina|translator=Elizabeth Yuval|title=The Fall of a Sparrow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HYOUnwFEHd8C&amp;q=Borkowska#v=snippet&amp;q=Borkowska&amp;f=false|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2010|page=51|isbn=0804762481|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reportedly remained a faithful Catholic, nonetheless.&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt;

==Recognition==
In 1984, Borkowska, now living alone in a small apartment in [[Warsaw]], was awarded the title of [[Righteous among the Nations]] by [[Yad Vashem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1553">'''Antonio Alberti''' was an [[Italy|Italian]] painter, active mainly in the 15th century in his native city of  [[Ferrara]], as well as [[Bologna]] and [[Urbino]].

==Biography==
He painted portraits and sacred subjects. For the sacristy of the church of San Bernardino, outside [[Urbino]], he painted a ''Madonna and Child enthroned'' (1439). He painted frescoes in the Bolognini chapel at [[San Petronio Basilica]] in Bologna, consisting of incidents from the ''Passion'', ''Paradise'', and ''Inferno'' . He painted frescoes of the ''Virgin and child between saints Benedict and Sebastian'' (1433) for the inner choir of Sant' Antonio Abate in Ferrara. He had a son of the same name, who was also an artist, living in 1550. [[Onofrio Gabrieli]] and [[Fra Carnovale]] were his pupils. His grandson was [[Timoteo della Vite]].

The '''United States National Academy of Sciences' Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy''' (STEP) is a board of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]].

The mandate of the Board is to integrate understanding of scientific, technological, and economic elements in the formulation of national policies affecting the economic well-being of the United States. The program’s focus is on the dynamics of the macroeconomic and microeconomic variables, their relationship to the industrial structure of the economy, effect on high-technology manufacturing and service sectors, and influence on U.S. scientific and technological advancement through examination of trade, human resources, fiscal, research and development, intellectual property and other policies. Policymakers responsible for these areas in the executive branch and Congress are the audience for the STEP Board’s work in the form of consensus reports, conferences, and workshops. The current Executive Director is Stephen A. Merrill, Ph.D. and the Board Chair is Paul Joskow, president of the Sloan Foundation.

== History and evolution ==

===Establishment===
The Academies began to address issues of U.S. competitiveness and innovation in the late 1970s and early 1980s through a series of industry studies by the NAE and broad policy studies by the [[Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy]] (COSEPUP).

A leading NAS economist, [[Dale Jorgenson]], and NAE industrialists [[Ralph Landau]] and [[George Hatsopoulos]] were concerned that this work, and national innovation policy more broadly, did not sufficiently reflect the contributions economics could make to understanding of trends and policy prescriptions to improve outcomes. They proposed to the National Research Council (NRC) Governing Board of Directors of the NAS to create a new standing committee as a forum for dialogue among economists, technologists, and industrial managers to those ends. The Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy (STEP) was established in 1991, originally as an independent board with funding from the NRC and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. Subsequently, it was combined with COSEPUP and Government-University-Industry Research Roundtable (GUIRR) in the Policy Division, at which time the Academy and Institute presidents were made ex-officio members to make the three units more similar in structure.

===Composition===
In composing the first slate of members, the Academies added a fourth category of expertise and experience – finance and investment – and took care to ensure that among the members were people with high-level public policy experience. Over the past 16 years the membership has included leading industrialists (Rube Mettler, Don Peterson, Bill Spencer), three Nobel Laureates (Mike Spence, Joe Stiglitz, and Jim Heckman) among many leading microeconomists, prominent venture capitalists (Burton McMurtry, Kathy Behrens, and [[David Morgenthaler]]), scientists and engineers from the Academies (George Whitesides and Vint Cerf), former policymakers (James Lynn, Mary Good, and Alan Wolff), and people whose careers have bridged the corporate and nonprofit sectors (Edward Penhoet) or industry and elective politics (Amo Houghton, Jr.). In STEP’s first decade the majority of industrialists represented heavy manufacturing and information technology. In recent years there has been an effort to recruit more senior managers from life science-based industries and services.

===Policy environment and focus===
Not coincidentally, concern about Japanese competition and fear of a progressive decline in the U.S. manufacturing base was peaking at the time STEP was created. Indeed, the perception that Japan enjoyed a broad and enduring competitive advantage from a substantially lower cost of capital was a motivating factor in establishing the Board and became the subject of its first conference and report. In the late 1990s, of course, pessimism gave way to extreme confidence in the economy, lasting until the [[dot-com collapse]]. The contemporary policy environment is again one of concern if not alarm about U.S. economic performance, although vis-à-vis different sources of competition.

In this fluctuating environment, STEP’s focus has not shifted away from the U.S. position in the global economy. Investing for Productivity and Prosperity was followed by a series of projects examining development of international technical standards and testing certification, technology policy as a source of trade friction among the industrialized countries, tax policy affecting the location of foreign direct investment and R&amp;D performance, evaluation of U.S. and foreign government interventions in support of commercial technology development, and the effects of foreign government conditions on aerospace sales and investment. A major focus since the late 1990s has been on the reasons for the improved competitiveness of many U.S. industries and the resurgence in productivity growth, the extent to which these are accurately measured and reflected in the national economic accounts, and how they can be sustained.

Nevertheless, the STEP portfolio has become more diversified, with projects on the economics of [[K-12 education]] reform, impact of technology on jobs and wages, supply of IT workers, quality of innovation-related statistics, functioning of the patent system, impact of intellectual property on research, shifts in the federal research portfolio by field, financing of entrepreneurship, prizes as a tool of innovation policy, and aeronautics R&amp;D at [[NASA]]. This diversification has been a key to STEP’s success and endurance, but the board is mindful that global competition and its effects on Americans’ employment and welfare remain the principal driver of its agenda. When, as now, public and political concern is ascendant, other institutions and others in the Academy are quickly drawn into this policy arena to compete for many of the same sources of financial support. Within the past 3 or 4 years alone nominally similar programs have been launched at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], [[Brookings Institution]], [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], and [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] and spun off from the [[Progressive Policy Institute]].

Since nearly all of STEP’s work is [[microeconomic]], other ways to parse STEP’s portfolio are by industrial sector and by microeconomic policy. On the first dimension, STEP has focused intensively on semiconductors, software, computing (and its component technologies), and biotechnology and given considerable attention also to aviation, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, telecommunications, metal fabrication, and finance. At the same time, STEP has done significant although by no means exhaustive work on the following microeconomic policies – tax, trade, standards, K-12 and graduate education, workforce training, intellectual property, economic statistics, and, of course, direct and indirect research and development support.

Areas that have received little attention to date are agriculture, energy and power, and environmental regulation. Although these are the domains of other standing NRC units that, of course, does not preclude STEP from undertaking projects in those areas tailored to its strengths nor does it preclude collaborations. Discussions have in fact occurred with each of those units (BANR, BEES, and BEST) and led to formal collaborative proposals, but unfortunately those proposals have not attracted sponsors.

== Accomplishments ==

===Dialogue===
Encouraging cross-disciplinary, cross-sector dialogue on issues of competitiveness and innovation was a major theme of the NRC discussions leading to the creation of STEP. The Board itself has sustained this dialogue across many changes in membership notably including the departure recently of the last original member, Dale Jorgenson. Meetings are well attended and members frequently remark on the high caliber of discussion and learning across disciplines and sectors.

STEP has extended this form of dialogue to the many ad hoc committees under its oversight. Normally, STEP study committees include 2 or 3 STEP members – a testament to the fact that many (perhaps most) projects are conceived in board discussions and members become committed to helping carry them through to fruition. In addition, an effort is made to ensure that study committee rosters recommended to the Division Chair and the President include a mix of expertise and experience similar to that on the board itself – industrial technologists, economists, financial executives, academic scientists, and former policymakers

STEP has also contributed to dialogue within the NRC. Staff are frequently asked to suggest committee members and other resources for studies in other units. Formal collaborations have involved the Science, Technology, and Law Committee, Committee on National Statistics, Computer Science and Telecommunications Board, Board on Higher Education and the Workforce, Board on Testing and Assessment, National Cancer Policy Board, and Board on Health Care Services (of the National Academies).

===Contributions to research===
STEP has benefited from and exploited the microeconomic field of technology and productivity analysis that is the fairly recent legacy of Griliches, Jorgenson, Solow, Mansfield, and others as well as the work of international trade economists. But the fact is that in many of the specific policy areas of STEP work – intellectual property, standards, program evaluation, etc. – there is a serious deficit of empirical research. Rather than rely on anecdote and judgment, the Board has when possible taken the step – unusual for the Academy – of supporting small-scale original research projects, often surveys. This was done in studies of the patent system, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, Advanced Technology Program (ATP), and biomedical researchers’ experience with intellectual property. In all of these cases, the research results strongly influenced study committees’ findings and recommendations. That, in turn, has encouraged more research. In the case of the patent study, the Board in 2002 issued an RFP, received 80-odd proposals, and selected 9 projects for full or co-funding. This undoubtedly contributed to the subsequent flowering of empirical research on intellectual property systems and policies.

More typical of the Academy, STEP work has helped shape the agendas of investigators and research sponsors. A prime example is the 2001 workshop, Using Human Resource Data to Track Innovation, whose premise was that studying the qualifications, career paths, and activities of industrial scientists, engineers, and other professionals could reveal a great deal about innovation processes, especially those beyond the R&amp;D stage. The workshop has shaped the subsequent work of Paula Stephan, who was commissioned to write the principal paper for the meeting, and led directly to a series of NSF workshops, other research initiatives, and efforts to improve the utility of data from the NSF surveys of PhD-holders. A community of investigators is exploring ways to match publication and patent data with NSF human resource data. Stephan attributes all of this activity directly to the seminal STEP workshop.

== Domestic policy impact ==
STEP reports have had a demonstrable impact on public policy discussions and outcomes. Examples include:

''A Patent System for the 21st Century'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Richard C. and Mark B. Myers. (2004). A Patent System for the 21st Century. Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2004 a STEP committee chaired by Yale President Richard Levin and former Xerox CTO Mark Myers issued a final report of a broad study of how well the U.S. patent system is fulfilling its purpose of encouraging research, innovation, and the dissemination of knowledge and how it is adapting to rapid technological and economic changes. It found that while the system has shown admirable flexibility in accommodating new technologies, there is reason to be concerned about the quality of issued patents, the resources available to the US Patent and Trademark Office to keep up with the pace of technological change and volume of applications, features of U.S. law that inhibit the dissemination of information contained in patents and that raise the cost and uncertainty of litigation over patent validity and infringement, access to patented research technologies for basic non-commercial research, and redundancies and inconsistencies among national patent systems that raise the cost of global intellectual property protection.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. and Mark B. Myers. (2004). A Patent System for the 21st Century. Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press&lt;/ref&gt; With dedicated dissemination funds provided by the NRC, a private foundation, and several companies and law firms, a very extensive outreach effort, involving public meetings across the country, was undertaken. The committee co-chairs were lead-off witnesses in Senate and House patent reform hearings in the spring of 2005 and again in 2007. Five of the report’s seven recommendations are core provisions of legislation introduced by the committee chairs in the 109th Congress and expected to be re-introduced in the 110th.

* ''Trends in Federal Support of Research and Graduate Education'' (2001). Using data collected by NSF annually from federal agencies but rarely analyzed, this report documented in detail significant shifts in the allocation of public research spending and graduate student support in the 1990s and related these to state, foundation, and industry funding patterns. It found a substantial real decline in federal investment in most of the physical sciences and engineering fields and corresponding declines in the number of federally supported graduate students in those fields.&lt;ref&gt;The National Research Council of The National Academies. Committee on Trends in Federal Spending on Scientific and Engineering Research. (2001). Trends in Federal Support of Research and Graduate Education. Washington, D. C. The National Academies Press&lt;/ref&gt; The report was cited by the Senate Appropriations Committee, OSTP Director Jack Marburger, then NSF Director Rita Colwell, and the Semiconductor Industry Association. It contributed to the recommendations of the President’s committee of Advisers on Science and Technology (PCAST), Council on Competitiveness, and COSEPUP Augustine panel, the President’s 2007 budget, and bipartisan congressional majorities for significant increases in the federal funding of physical science and engineering research.
* ''The Advanced Technology Program: Assessing Outcomes'' (2001). This report represented a comprehensive review of the operations of the Advanced Technology Program (ATP), administered by the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to accelerate development of high-risk technologies with promising economic benefits through cost-shared funding. The study committee concluded that the program has shown considerable success attributable in part to appropriate selection criteria, rigorous peer review of technical feasibility and commercial potential, and careful evaluation of outcomes. The report was the subject of a hearing before the House Science Committee and was cited by the Senate Appropriations Committee in justifying an increase in ATP’s funding. STEP’s evaluation is undoubtedly a factor in ATP’s survival despite repeated administration proposals and House of Representative votes to terminate the program. NIST recently issued a solicitation for new ATP proposals.

===International reputation===
In part through the Board’s outreach efforts and in part because of interest abroad in the contributions of federal and state government policy to U.S. economic performance, there is a growing international audience for STEP’s work, evidenced by the high volume of visits to the website and invitations for presentations to international organizations (e.g., various committees of the OECD, parts of the European Commission, World Intellectual Property Organization, and European Patent Office), and national government officials and international academic gatherings too numerous to list. Originally confined to the industrial countries this interest has extended to the governments of and academics in the emerging economies – China, India, Brazil, Vietnam, and the former Soviet republics.

STEP has received project support from the [[OECD]], [[European Commission]], [[Industry Canada]], and Embassy of the United Kingdom. A formal collaboration with two of the German economic research institutes yielded two reports, and in 1995 STEP was asked to host an international conference on technology and jobs preparatory to the G-7 Summit meeting.

Congress is a principal consumer of STEP work, and the Board has conducted or is conducting three congressionally mandated projects. A fourth mandate – the ongoing evaluation of 5 agencies’ SBIR programs – followed STEP work on SBIR but has been carried out under separate oversight. Discussion is underway with members of Congress of a major study of the role of intangible assets (R&amp;D, intellectual property, software, worker training, and organizational competence) in economic growth. Nevertheless, what will appear in final legislation or bill report language is always highly uncertain; and agency compliance with congressional study mandates is not assured. STEP has twice negotiated language with congressional sponsors for studies that were eventually included in enacted legislation and developed proposals to the executive agencies directed to contract with the Academies, but the mandates were not executed.

The '''''brit milah''''' ({{lang-he-n|בְּרִית מִילָה}}, {{IPA-he|bʁit miˈla|pron}}; [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]] pronunciation: {{IPA-he|bʁis ˈmilə|}}, "covenant of [[circumcision]]"; [[Yiddish]] pronunciation: ''bris'' {{IPA-yi|bʀɪs|}}) is a Jewish religious male [[Religious male circumcision|circumcision ceremony]] performed by a [[mohel]] ("circumciser") on the eighth day of the infant's life. The ''brit milah'' is followed by a celebratory meal (''[[seudat mitzvah]]'').

==Biblical references==
{{main|Religious male circumcision}}
{{see also|Covenant (biblical)#Abrahamic covenant}}
[[File:Isaac's circumcision, Regensburg c1300.jpg|thumb|left|"Isaac's Circumcision", Regensburg Pentateuch, c1300]]
According to the [[Hebrew Bible]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|17:10–14|HE}}) [[Names of God in Judaism|God]] commanded the Biblical patriarch [[Abraham]] to be circumcised, an act to be followed by his descendants:
{{quote|10 This is My covenant, which ye shall keep, between Me and you and thy seed after thee: every male among you shall be circumcised. 11 And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt Me and you. 12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any foreigner, that is not of thy seed. 13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised; and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 14 And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken My covenant.}}

Also, {{bibleverse||Leviticus|12:3|HE}} provides: "And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised."

According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], it was "a reproach" for an [[Israelite]] to be uncircumcised ([[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 5:9.)  The term ''arelim'' ("uncircumcised" [plural]) is used opprobriously, denoting the [[Philistines]] and other non-Israelites ([[Books of Samuel|I Samuel]] 14:6, 31:4; II Samuel 1:20) and used in conjunction with ''tameh'' (unpure) for heathen ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 52:1). The word ''arel'' ("uncircumcised" [singular]) is also employed for "impermeable" ([[Leviticus]] 26:41, "their uncircumcised hearts"; compare [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 9:25; [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 44:7, 9); it is also applied to the first three years' fruit of a tree, which is forbidden ([[Leviticus]] 19:23).

However, the Israelites born in the wilderness after the [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] from Egypt were not circumcised. [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 5:2–9, explains, "all the people that came out" of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] were circumcised, but those "born in the wilderness" were not. Therefore, Joshua, before the celebration of the [[Passover]], had them circumcised at [[Gilgal]] specifically before they entered Canaan. Abraham, too, was circumcised when he moved into Canaan.

The prophetic tradition emphasizes that God expects people to be good as well as pious, and that non-Jews will be judged based on their ethical behavior, see [[Noahide Law]]. Thus, Jeremiah 9:25–26 says that circumcised and uncircumcised will be punished alike by the Lord; for "all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart."

The penalty of non-observance is ''[[kareth]]'' (spiritual excision from the Jewish nation), as noted in {{bibleverse||Genesis|17:1–14|HE}}. [[Conversion to Judaism]] for non-Israelites in Biblical times necessitated circumcision, otherwise one could not partake in the [[Passover]] offering ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:48|HE}}). Today, as in the time of Abraham, it is required of converts in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism]]. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|34:14–16|HE}}).

As found in Genesis 17:1–14, ''brit milah'' is considered to be so important that should the eighth day fall on [[Shabbat|the Sabbath]], actions that would normally be forbidden because of the sanctity of the day are permitted in order to fulfill the requirement to circumcise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Talmud/shabbat19.html Tractate Shabbat: Chapter 19, Regulations ordained by R. Eliezer concerning circumcision on the Sabbath] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425221632/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Talmud/shabbat19.html |date=2016-04-25 }}, accessed on 23 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Talmud]], when discussing the importance of Milah, compares it to being equal to all other mitzvot (commandments) based on the [[gematria]] for ''brit'' of 612 (Tractate [[Nedarim (tractate)|Nedarim]] 32a).

Covenants in ancient times were sometimes sealed by severing an animal, with the implication that the party who breaks the covenant will suffer a similar fate. In Hebrew, the verb meaning "to seal a covenant" translates literally as "to cut". It is presumed by Jewish scholars that the removal of the foreskin symbolically represents such a sealing of the covenant.&lt;ref&gt;"Circumcision." Mark Popovsky. Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion. Ed. David A. Leeming, Kathryn Madden and Stanton Marlan. New York: Springer, 2010. pp. 153–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament===
{{see also|Feast of the Circumcision of Christ}}
Due to [[Jesus]] having [[Circumcision of Jesus|undertaken]] this ceremony as a Jewish child, memory of this tradition has been preserved in traditional Christian churches according to the [[Gospel of Luke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref|Luke|2:21}} (King James Version): "And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the northern European calculation, which abstracts from the day from which the count begins, the interval was of seven days.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Feast of the Circumcision of Christ]] is kept as a feast eight days after [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] in a number of churches including the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Catholic Church]], [[Lutheran]] and some [[Anglican Communion]] churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Significantly, the tradition of [[baptism]] universally replaced circumcision among Christians as the primary [[rite of passage]] as found in [[Paul the Apostle|Paul's]] [[Epistle to the Colossians]] and in [[Acts of the Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref|Colossians|2:11–12}}{{Bibleref|Acts|15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{secondary source needed|date=May 2017}}

===Mohel===
A [[mohel]] is a Jew trained in the practice of ''brit milah'', the "covenant of circumcision." According to traditional Jewish law, in the absence of a grown free Jewish male expert, anyone who has the required skills is also authorized to perform the circumcision, provided that they are Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Avodah Zarah 26b; Menachot 42a; Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, Milah, ii. 1; [[Shulkhan Arukh]], Yoreh De'ah, l.c.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most streams of non-Orthodox Judaism allow female mohels, called ''mohalot'' ({{lang-he|מוֹהֲלוֹת}}, plural of {{lang|he|מוֹהֶלֶת}} ''mohelet'', feminine of ''mohel''), without restriction. In 1984, Deborah Cohen became the first certified Reform mohelet; she was certified by the Berit Mila program of Reform Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131007073323/http://beritmila.org/ Berit Mila Program of Reform Judaism] Retrieved 2 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time and place===
[[File:Fauteuil de circoncision ("Fauteuil d'Elie").jpg|thumb|''Chair of Elijah'' used during the ''brit milah'' ceremony – [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme]]]]
It is customary for the brit to be held in a synagogue, but it can also be held at home or any other suitable location. The brit is performed on the eighth day from the baby's birth, taking into consideration that according to the Jewish calendar, the day begins at the sunset of the day before. If the baby is born on Sunday before sunset, the Brit will be held the following Sunday. However, if the baby is born on Sunday night after sunset, the Brit is on the following Monday. The brit takes place on the eighth day following birth even if that day is Shabbat or a holiday. A brit is traditionally performed in the morning, but it may be performed any time during daylight hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Talmud explicitly instructs that a boy must not be circumcised if he had two brothers who died due to complications arising from their circumcisions,&lt;ref name="JewEncMor"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=Morbidity|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=763&amp;letter=M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maimonides]] says that this excluded paternal half-brothers.

If the child is born [[premature baby|prematurely]] or has other serious medical problems, the brit milah will be postponed until the doctors and mohel deem the child strong enough.

====Adult circumcision====
In recent years, the circumcision of adult Jews who were not circumcised as infants has become more common than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 24 August 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, the brit milah will be done at the earliest date that can be arranged. The actual circumcision will be private, and other elements of the ceremony (e.g., the celebratory meal) may be modified to accommodate the desires of the one being circumcised.

===Anesthetic===
Most prominent ''[[acharonim]]'' rule that the ''[[mitzvah]]'' of brit milah lies in the pain it causes, and anesthetic, sedation, or ointment should generally not be used.&lt;ref name="Rabbi Yaakov Montrose, 2011, pp. 29-32"&gt;Rabbi Yaakov Montrose. ''Halachic World – Volume 3: Contemporary [[Halakha|Halachic]] topics based on the [[Parshah]]''. "Lech Lecha – No Pain, No Bris?" Feldham Publishers 2011, pp. 29–32&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is traditionally common to feed the infant a drop of wine or other sweet liquid to soothe him.&lt;ref name="Judaism 101 Brit Milah: Circumcision"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rich|first1=Tracey|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/birth.htm#Brit|title=Judaism 101 – Birth and the First month of Life|publisher=jewfaq.org|accessdate=22 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601180905/http://www.jewfaq.org/birth.htm#Brit|archivedate=1 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Patricia|title=Study confirms that wine drops soothe boys during circumcision|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/11033/study-confirms-that-wine-drops-soothe-boys-during-circumcision/|accessdate=22 June 2016|agency=J.|publisher=jweekly.com|date=June 11, 1999|ref=wine drops soothe|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813013454/http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/11033/study-confirms-that-wine-drops-soothe-boys-during-circumcision/|archivedate=13 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eliezer Waldenberg]], [[Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg]], [[Shmuel Wosner]], [[Moshe Feinstein]] and others agree that the child should not be sedated, although pain relieving ointment may be used under certain conditions; [[Shmuel Wosner]] particularly asserts that the act ought to be painful, per [[Psalms]] 44:23.&lt;ref name="Rabbi Yaakov Montrose, 2011, pp. 29-32"/&gt;

Regarding an adult circumcision, pain is ideal, but not mandatory.

In a letter to the editor published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on January 3, 1998, [[Moshe David Tendler|Rabbi Moshe David Tendler]] disagrees with the above and writes, "It is a biblical prohibition to cause anyone unnecessary pain". Rabbi Tendler recommends the use of an [[analgesic|analgesic cream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Kvater===
The title of ''[[wikt:קוואַטער|kvater]]'' among [[Ashkenazi Jews]] is for the person who carries the baby from the mother to the father, who in turn carries him to the ''[[mohel]].'' This honor is usually given to a couple without children, as a merit or ''[[Segula (Kabbalah)|segula]]'' (efficacious remedy) that they should have children of their own. The origin of the term is [[Middle High German]] ''gevater(e)'' ("godfather").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beider|first=Alexander|title=Origins of Yiddish Dialects|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seudat mitzvah===
After the ceremony, a [[Seudat mitzvah|celebratory meal]] takes place. At the ''[[birkat hamazon]]'', additional introductory lines, known as ''Nodeh Leshimcha'', are added. These lines praise God and request the permission of God, the [[Torah]], [[Kohen|Kohanim]] and distinguished people present to proceed with the grace. When the four main blessings are concluded, special ''ha-Rachaman'' prayers are recited. They request various blessings by God that include:
# the parents of the baby, to help them raise him wisely;
# the ''[[sandek]]'' (companion of child);
# the baby boy to have strength and grow up to trust in God and perceive Him [[Three pilgrim festivals|three times a year]];
# the ''mohel'' for unhesitatingly performing the ritual;
# to send the [[Messiah in Judaism]] speedily in the merit of this ''[[mitzvah]]'';
# to send [[Elijah (prophet)|Elijah]] the prophet, known as "The Righteous Kohen", so that God's covenant can be fulfilled with the re-establishment of the throne of King [[David]].

However, on ritual circumcisions performed by a mohel, the epithelium is most commonly peeled off only after the foreskin has been amputated. This procedure is called ''priah'' ({{lang-he|פריעה}}), which means: 'uncovering'. The main goal of "priah" (also known as "bris periah"), is to remove as much of the inner layer of the foreskin as possible and prevent the movement of the shaft skin, what creates the look and function of what is known as a "low and tight" circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 'priah' has been performed as part of the Jewish circumcision since the [[Israelites]] first inhabited the [[Land of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud Bavli]] Tractate Yebamoth 71b: Rabbah b. Isaac stated in the name of Rab: The commandment of uncovering the corona at circumcision was not given to Abraham; for it is said, At that time the Lord said unto Joshua: 'Make thee knives of flint etc.' But is it not possible [that this applied to] those who were not previously circumcised; for it is written, For all the people that came out were circumcised, but all the people that were born etc.? — If so, why the expression. 'Again!' Consequently it must apply to the uncovering of the corona.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the ''Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion'', states that many Hellenistic Jews attempted to restore their foreskins, and that similar action was taken during the Hadrianic persecution, a period in which a prohibition against circumcision was issued. Thus, the writers of the dictionary hypothesize that the more severe method practiced today was probably begun in order to prevent the possibility of restoring the foreskin after circumcision, and therefore the rabbis added the requirement of cutting the foreskin in periah.&lt;ref&gt;Werblowsky, R.J. Zwi &amp; Wigoder, Geoffrey (1997) The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion.

===''{{transl|he|Metzitzah}}''===
The guard (top center) is slid over the foreskin as close to the [[glans]] as possible to allow for maximum removal of the former without any injury to the latter.  The [[scalpel]] is used to detach the foreskin, and the underlying blue bag is a [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]] pouch for the metal tools.  The tube (center left) was used for ''metzitzah''
In addition to ''{{transl|he|milah}}'' (the actual circumcision) and ''{{transl|he|p'riah}}'', mentioned above, the [[Talmud]] ([[Mishnah]] Shabbat 19:2) mentions a third step, ''{{transl|he|metzitzah}}'', translated as suction, as one of the steps involved in the circumcision rite. The Talmud writes that a "[[Mohel]] (Circumciser) who does not suck creates a danger, and should be dismissed from practice".&lt;ref&gt;Tractate Shabbos 133b&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rambam – Maimonides in his "book of laws" Laws of Milah Chapter 2, paragraph 2: "...and afterwards he sucks the circumcision until blood comes out from far places, in order not to come to danger, and anyone who does not suck, we remove him from practice."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rashi]] on that Talmudic passage explains that this step is in order to draw some blood from deep inside the wound to prevent danger to the baby.&lt;ref&gt;Rashi and others on Tractate Shabbos 173a and 173b&lt;/ref&gt;
There are other modern antiseptic and antibiotic techniques—all used as part of the ''brit milah'' today—which many say accomplish the intended purpose of ''metzitzah'', however, since ''metzitzah'' is one of the four steps to fulfill Mitzvah, it continues to be practiced by many Orthodox and Hassidic Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The practice has become a controversy in both secular and [[Jewish medical ethics]]. The ritual of ''metzitzah'' is found in [[Mishnah]] Shabbat 19:2, which lists it as one of the four steps involved in the circumcision rite. Rabbi [[Moses Sofer]] (1762–1839) observed that the Talmud states that the rationale for this part of the ritual was hygienic — i.e., to protect the health of the child.  The Chasam Sofer issued a leniency (Heter) that some consider to have been conditional to perform ''metzitzah'' with a sponge to be used instead of oral suction in a letter to his student, Rabbi [[Lazar Horowitz]] of Vienna. This letter was never published among Rabbi Sofer's responsa but rather in the secular journal ''Kochvei Yitzchok.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moshe Schick]] (1807–1879), a student of Moses Sofer, states in his book of Responsa, ''She’eilos u’teshuvos Maharam Schick'' (Orach Chaim 152,) that Moses Sofer gave the ruling in that specific instance only because the mohel refused to step down and had secular Government connections that prevented his removal in favor of another mohel and the Heter may not be applied elsewhere. He also states (''Yoreh Deah'' 244) that the practice is possibly a Sinaitic tradition, i.e., [[Halacha l'Moshe m'Sinai]]. Other sources contradict this claim, with copies of Moses Sofer's responsa making no mention of the legal case or of his ruling applying in only one situation. Rather, that responsa makes quite clear that "metzizah" was a health measure and should never be employed where there is a health risk to the infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://onthemainline.blogspot.com/2012/04/chasam-sofers-ruling-on-metzitzah-be.html |website=onthemainline.blogspot.com |title=The Chasam Sofer's ruling on Metzitzah Be-peh |date=April 16, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402175402/http://onthemainline.blogspot.com/2012/04/chasam-sofers-ruling-on-metzitzah-be.html |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chaim Hezekiah Medini]], after corresponding with the greatest Jewish sages of the generation, concluded the practice to be [[Halacha l'Moshe m'Sinai]] and elaborates on what prompted Moses Sofer to give the above ruling.&lt;ref&gt;Sdei Chemed vol. 8 p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; He tells the story that a student of Moses Sofer, [[Lazar Horowitz]], [[Chief Rabbi of Vienna]] at the time and author of the responsa ''Yad Elazer'', needed the ruling because of a governmental attempt to ban circumcision completely if it included ''metztitzah b'peh.'' He therefore asked Sofer to give him permission to do ''brit milah'' without ''metzitzah b’peh.'' When he presented the defense in secular court, his testimony was erroneously recorded to mean that Sofer stated it as a general ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| quote = The mohel brings the baby’s organ into his mouth immediately after the excision of the foreskin and sucks blood from it vigorously. This action lowers the internal pressure in the tissues of the organ, in the blood vessels of the head of the organ and in the exposed ends of the arterioles that have just been cut. Thus, the difference between the pressure in the blood vessels in the base of the organ and the pressure in the blood vessels at its tip is increased. This requirement has deep religious significance as well as medical benefits....Immediately after incising or injuring an artery, the arterial walls contract and obstruct, or at least reduce, the flow of blood. Since the arterioles of the orlah, or the foreskin, branch off from the dorsal arteries (the arteries of the upper side of the organ), cutting away the foreskin can result in a temporary obstruction in these dorsal arteries. This temporary obstruction, caused by arterial muscle contraction, continues to develop into a more enduring blockage as the stationary blood begins to clot. The tragic result can be severe hypoxia (deprivation of the supply of blood and oxygen) of the glans penis.28 If the arterial obstruction becomes more permanent, gangrene follows; the baby may lose his glans, and it may even become a life-threatening situation. Such cases have been known to occur. Only by immediately clearing the blockage can one prevent such clotting from happening. Performing metzitzah immediately after circumcision lowers the internal pressure within the tissues and blood vessels of the glans, thus raising the pressure gradient between the blood vessels at the base of the organ and the blood vessels at its distal end—the glans as well as the excised arterioles of the foreskin, which branch off of the dorsal arteries. This increase in pressure gradient (by a factor of four to six!) can resolve an acute temporary blockage and restore blood flow to the glans, thus significantly reducing both the danger of immediate, acute hypoxia and the danger of developing a permanent obstruction by means of coagulation. How do we know when a temporary blockage has successfully been averted? When the “blood in the further reaches [i.e., the proximal dorsal artery] is extracted,” as Rambam has stated.}}

Because of the risk of infection, some rabbinical authorities have ruled that the traditional practice of direct contact should be replaced by using a sterile tube between the wound and the [[mohel]]'s mouth, so there is no direct oral contact. The [[Rabbinical Council of America]], the largest group of [[Modern Orthodox]] rabbis, endorses this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The “informed consent” regulation was challenged in court. In January 2013 the U.S. District court ruled that the law did not specifically target religion and therefore must not pass [[strict scrutiny]].

The ruling was appealed to the Court of Appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.becketlaw.org/case/central-rabbinical-congress-v-new-york-city-department-health-mental-hygiene/|title=Central Rabbinical Congress v.

On August 15, 2014 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision by the lower court, and ruled that the regulation does have to be reviewed under [[strict scrutiny]] to determine whether it infringes on Orthodox Jews' freedom of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/15/us-usa-newyork-circumcision-idUSKBN0GF1LZ20140815 |title=U.S. Court revives challenge to New York City circumcision law |accessdate=2017-06-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930150149/http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/15/us-usa-newyork-circumcision-idUSKBN0GF1LZ20140815 |archivedate=2015-09-30 |df= |newspaper=Reuters |date=2014-08-15 }}

===Hatafat dam brit===
A brit milah is more than circumcision, it is a sacred ritual in Judaism, as distinguished from its non-ritual requirement in [[Islam]]. One ramification is that the brit is not considered complete unless a drop of blood is actually drawn. The standard medical methods of [[circumcision]] through constriction do not meet the requirements of the [[halakhah]] for brit milah, because they cause [[hemostasis]], ''i.e.'', they stop the flow of blood. Moreover, circumcision alone, in the absence of the brit milah ceremony, does not fulfill the requirements of the mitzvah. Therefore, in cases where a Jew who was circumcised outside of a brit milah, an already-circumcised convert, or an [[Aposthia|aposthetic]] (born without a foreskin) individual, the mohel draws a symbolic drop of blood ({{lang-he|הטפת דם}}, {{transl|he|''hatafat-dam''}}) from the penis at the point where the foreskin would have been or was attached.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shulchan Aruch]], [[Yoreh De'ah]], 263:4&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Milah l'shem giur''==
[[File:Göttingen-Beschneidungswerkzeuge.02.JPG|thumb|right|Set of brit milah implements, [[Göttingen]] city museum]]
A ''Milah L'shem giur'' is a "Circumcision for the purpose of conversion". In [[Orthodox Judaism]], this procedure is usually done by adoptive parents for adopted boys who are being converted as part of the adoption or by families with young children converting together. It is also required for adult converts who were not previously circumcised, e.g. those born in countries where circumcision at birth is not common. The conversion of a minor is valid in both [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism]] until a child reaches the age of majority (13 for a boy, 12 for a girl); at that time the child has the option of renouncing his conversion and Judaism, and the conversion will then be considered retroactively invalid. He must be informed of his right to renounce his conversion if he wishes. If he does not make such a statement, it is accepted that the boy is halakhically Jewish. [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbis will generally not convert a non-Jewish child raised by a mother who has not converted to Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Paysach J. Krohn, ''Bris Milah'' [[Artscroll|Mesorah Publications Ltd]], 1985, pp.103-105&lt;/ref&gt;

The laws of conversion and conversion-related circumcision in [[Orthodox Judaism]] have numerous complications, and authorities recommend that a rabbi be consulted well in advance.

In [[Conservative Judaism]], the Milah l'Shem giur procedure is also performed for a boy whose mother has not converted, but with the intention that the child be raised Jewish.  This conversion of a child to Judaism without the conversion of the mother is allowed by [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] interpretations of [[halakha]]. Conservative Rabbis will authorize it only under the condition that the child be raised as a Jew in a single-faith household. Should the mother convert, and if the boy has not yet reached his third birthday, the child may be immersed in the [[mikveh]] with the mother, after the mother has already immersed, to become Jewish.  If the mother does not convert, the child may be immersed in a mikveh, or body of natural waters, to complete the child's conversion to Judaism. This can be done before the child is even one year old. If the child did not immerse in the [[mikveh]], or the boy was too old, then the child may choose of their own accord to become Jewish at age 13 as a [[Bar Mitzvah]], and complete the conversion then.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19861990/reisner_conversion.pdf Rabbi Avram Israel Reisner, On the conversion of adoptive and patrilineal children] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127135422/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19861990/reisner_conversion.pdf |date=2010-11-27 }}, Rabbinical Assembly [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]], 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ceremony, when performed l'Shem giur, does not have to be performed on a particular day, and does not override [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish Holidays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* In Orthodox Judaism, there is a split of authorities on whether the child receives a [[Hebrew name]] at the Brit ceremony or upon immersion in the [[Mikvah]]. According to ''Zichron Brit LeRishonim'', naming occurs at the Brit with a different formula than the standard Brit Milah. The more common practice among [[Ashkenazic]] Jews follows Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], with naming occurring at immersion.

Where the procedure was performed but not followed by immersion or other requirements of the conversion procedure (e.g., in [[Conservative Judaism]], where the mother has not converted), if the boy chooses to complete the conversion at [[Bar Mitzvah]], a ''Milah l'shem giur'' performed when the boy was an infant removes the obligation to undergo either a full brit milah or ''hatafat dam brit''.

==Reasons for circumcision==

Nowadays it is generally assumed that Judaism adopted the practice of circumcision from neighboring cultures; their reasons for performing the act remain to be studied.

In ''Of the Special Laws, Book 1'', the Jewish philosopher [[Philo]] (20 BCE – CE 50) gives six reasons for the practice of circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  He attributes four of the reasons to "men of divine spirit and wisdom."  These include the idea that circumcision:
# protects against disease,
# secures cleanliness "in a way that is suited to the people consecrated to God,"
# causes the circumcised portion of the penis to resemble a heart, thereby representing a physical connection between the "breath contained within the heart [that] is generative of thoughts, and the generative organ itself [that] is productive of living beings," and
# promotes prolificness by removing impediments to the flow of semen.

To these, Philo added two of his own reasons, including the idea that circumcision
# &lt;li value="5"&gt;"signified figuratively the excision of all superfluous and excessive pleasure," and&lt;/li&gt;
# "is a symbol of a man's knowing himself."

[[Saadia Gaon|Rabbi Saadia Gaon]] considers something to be "complete," if it lacks nothing, but also has nothing that is unneeded. He regards the foreskin an unneeded organ that God created in man, and so by amputating it, the man is completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[Maimonides]] (Moses ben Maimon "Rambam", CE 1135–1204), who apart from being a great Torah scholar was also a physician and philosopher, argued that circumcision serves as a common bodily sign to members of the same faith. He also asserted that the main purpose of the act is to repress sexual pleasure, with the strongest reason being that it is difficult for a woman to separate from an uncircumcised man with whom she has had sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The author of [[Sefer ha-Chinuch]]&lt;ref&gt;2nd commandment&lt;/ref&gt; provides three reasons for the practice of circumcision:
# To complete the form of man, by removing what he claims to be a redundant organ;
# To mark the chosen people, so that their bodies will be different as their souls are. The organ chosen for the mark is the one responsible for the sustenance of the species.
# The completion effected by circumcision is not congenital, but left to the man. This implies that as he completes the form of his body, so can he complete the form of his soul.

Talmud professor [[Daniel Boyarin]] offered two explanations for circumcision. One is that it is a literal inscription on the Jewish body of the name of God in the form of the letter "[[yodh|yud]]" (from "yesod"). The second is that the act of bleeding represents a feminization of Jewish men, significant in the sense that the covenant represents a marriage between Jews and (a symbolically male) God.&lt;ref&gt;Boyarin, Daniel. {{"'}}This We Know to Be the Carnal Israel': Circumcision and the Erotic Life of God and Israel", Critical Inquiry. (Spring, 1992), 474-506.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reform Judaism==
The Reform societies established in Frankfurt and Berlin regarded circumcision as barbaric and wished to abolish it. However, while prominent rabbis such as [[Abraham Geiger]] believed the ritual to be barbaric and outdated, they refrained from instituting any change in this matter. In 1843, when a father in Frankfurt refused to circumcise his son, rabbis of all shades in Germany stated it was mandated by Jewish law; even [[Samuel Holdheim]] affirmed this.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;Judith Bleich, "The Circumcision Controversy in Classical Reform in Historical Context", KTAV Publishing House, 2007. pp. 1–28.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1871, Reform rabbinic leadership in Germany reasserted "the supreme importance of circumcision in Judaism", while affirming the traditional viewpoint that non-circumcised are Jews nonetheless. Although the issue of circumcision of converts continues to be debated, the necessity of Brit Milah for Jewish infant boys has been stressed in every subsequent Reform rabbis manual or guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The connection of the Reform movement to an anti-circumcision, pro-symbolic stance is a historical one.&lt;ref name="Yivo"&gt;{{quote|In the first half of the nineteenth century, various European governments considered regulating, if not banning, ''berit milah'' on the grounds that it posed potential medical dangers. In the 1840s, radical Jewish reformers in [[Frankfurt]] asserted that circumcision should no longer be compulsory. This controversy reached [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in the 1880s. Russian Jewish physicians expressed concern over two central issues: the competence of those carrying out the procedure and the method used for ''metsitsah''. Many Jewish physicians supported the idea of procedural and hygienic reforms in the practice, and they debated the question of physician supervision during the ceremony. Most significantly, many advocated carrying out ''metsitsah'' by pipette, not by mouth. In 1889, a committee on circumcision convened by the Russian Society for the Protection of Health, which included leading Jewish figures, recommended educating the Jewish public about the concerns connected with circumcision, in particular, the possible transmission of diseases such as [[tuberculosis]] and [[syphilis]] through the custom of ''metsitsah'' by mouth.

Veniamin Portugalov, who—alone among Russian Jewish physicians—called for the abolition of circumcision, set off these discussions. Portugalov not only denied all medical claims regarding the sanitary advantages of circumcision but disparaged the practice as barbaric, likening it to pagan ritual mutilation. Ritual circumcision, he claimed, stood as a self-imposed obstacle to the Jews’ [[Jewish emancipation|attainment of true equality with the other peoples of Europe]].|author=Epstein, Lisa|source=[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Circumcision "Circumcision"], ''[[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]]'', [[Yale University Press]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the early days of the movement in [[Germany]] and [[Eastern Europe]],&lt;ref name="Yivo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gollaher|first=David|author-link=David Gollaher|title=Circumcision: A History Of The World's Most Controversial Surgery |chapter=1, ''The Jewish Tradition'' |pages=1–30 |date=February 2001 |publisher=Basic Books|location=New York City|isbn=978-0465026531 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usEzSffvPBMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; some classical Reformers hoped to replace ritual circumcision "with a symbolic act, as has been done for other bloody practices, such as the sacrifices".&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jacob (1998), ''Divine Law in Human Hands: Case Studies in Halakhic Flexibility''. [[Jerusalem]]: [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]], {{ISBN|978-9652239808}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, an official Reform resolution in 1893 announced converts are no longer mandated to undergo the ritual,&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Michael. "''Berit Mila'' within the History of the Reform Movement" in Barth, Lewis (1990), ''Berit Mila in the Reform Context''. New York: Berit Milah Board of reform Judaism.&lt;/ref&gt; and this ambivalence towards the practice has carried over to classical-minded Reform Jews today. In Elyse Wechterman's essay ''A Plea for Inclusion'', she argues that, even in the absence of circumcision, committed Jews should never be turned away, especially by a movement "where no other ritual observance is mandated". She goes on to advocate an alternate covenant ceremony, ''brit atifah'', for both boys and girls as a welcoming ritual into Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Mark, Elizabeth Wyner (2003) ''The Covenant of Circumcision''. Lebanon, New Hampshire: Brandeis {{ISBN|1584653078}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a continuing negativity towards circumcision still present within a minority of modern-day Reform, Judaic scholar Jon Levenson has warned that if they "continue to judge ''brit milah'' to be not only medically unnecessary but also brutalizing and mutilating ... the abhorrence of it expressed by some early Reform leaders will return with a vengeance", proclaiming that circumcision will be "the latest front in the battle over the Jewish future in America".&lt;ref&gt;Levenson, Jon (March 2000). "The New Enemies of Circumcision", ''Commentary''&lt;/ref&gt;

Many European Jewish fathers during the nineteenth century chose not to circumcise their sons, including [[Theodor Herzl]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Desmond (1974), ''Theodor Herzl''. New York: Doubleday, {{ISBN|978-0385088961}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldman 1997" /&gt; However, unlike many other forms of religious observance, it remained one of the last rituals Jewish communities could enforce. In most of Europe, both the government and the unlearned Jewish masses believed circumcision to be a rite akin to baptism, and the law allowed communities not to register uncircumcised children as Jewish. This legal maneuver spurred several debates addressing the advisibility of its use, since many parents later chose to convert to Christianity. In early 20th-century Russia, [[Chaim Soloveitchik]] advised his colleagues to reject this measure, stating that uncircumcised Jewish males are no less Jewish than Jews who violate other commandments.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

[[Capital punishment]] is a legal and often-used form of [[punishment]] in [[North Korea]] for many offences, such as [[grand theft]], [[murder]], [[rape]], [[drug smuggling]], [[treason]], [[espionage]], [[political dissident|political dissidence]], [[defection]], [[piracy]], consumption of [[censorship|media not approved]] by the government and [[proselyte|proselytizing]] religious beliefs that contradict practiced ''[[Juche]]'' ideology.&lt;ref name="United Nations Human Rights Council 2014"/&gt; Current working knowledge of the topic depends heavily on the accounts of [[North Korean defectors|defectors]] (both relatives of victims, and former members of the government).&lt;ref name="United Nations Human Rights Council 2014"/&gt; [[Execution]]s are mostly carried out by [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]], [[hanging]] or [[decapitation]] in public, making North Korea one of the last four countries to still perform [[public executions]], the other three being [[Public executions in Iran|Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Somalia]].&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

On November 3, 2013, according to a [[JoongAng Ilbo]] report, at least 80 people were publicly executed for minor offenses. The executions were said to be carried out simultaneously in [[Wonsan]], [[Chongjin]], [[Sariwon]], [[Pyongsong]] and three other North Korean cities for crimes such as watching South Korean movies, distributing [[pornography]] or possessing a Bible. According to a witness from Wonsan, 10,000 residents were forced to watch when eight people were machine-gunned to death at the local Shinpoong stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Public executions seen in 7 North Korea cities | work='Korea JoongAng Daily | url= http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2980240| accessdate=December 3, 2013 | first= Young-Jong | last= Lee | date=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] created a [[Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea|Commission of inquiry on human rights in the DPRK]], investigating and documenting many instances of executions carried out with or without trial, publicly or secretly, in response to political and other crimes that are often not among the most serious.

==Public executions==
North Korea resumed public executions in October 2007 after they had declined in the years following 2000 amidst international criticism. Prominent executed criminals include officials convicted of drug trafficking and embezzlement. Common criminals convicted of crimes such as murder, robbery, rape, drug dealing, smuggling, piracy, vandalism, etc. have also been reported to be executed, mostly by firing squad. The country does not publicly release national crime statistics or reports on the levels of crimes.&lt;ref name=USDOS-HRR2012&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2012&amp;dlid=204210 "Korea, Democratic People's Republic of"], ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State.

In October 2007, a South Pyongan province factory chief convicted of making international phone calls from 13 phones he installed in his factory basement was executed by firing squad in front of a crowd of 150,000 people in a stadium, according to a report from a South Korean aid agency called Good Friends.&lt;ref name=foreignpolicy-20110922/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,313226,00.html "150,000 Witness North Korea Execution of Factory Boss Whose Crime Was Making International Phone Calls"], ''Fox News'', November 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Good Friends also reported that six were killed in the rush as spectators left. In another instance, 15 people were publicly executed for crossing the border into China.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/10245/  Public executions by North Korea is another injustice] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129235623/http://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/10245# |date=2009-01-29 }}, ''Amnesty International'', March 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A U.N. General Assembly committee has adopted a draft resolution, co-sponsored by more than 50 countries, expressing "very serious concern" at reports of widespread human rights violations in North Korea, including public executions. North Korea has condemned the draft, saying it is inaccurate and biased, but it was still sent to the then 192-member General Assembly for a final vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Chandra Mohan Sharma''' (born 1976) is an Indian social activist, who used the [[Right to Information]] (RTI) act to fight against illegal encroachments of government land. He was known for his campaign against the [[land mafia]] in [[NOIDA]] and Delhi region. In 2014, he was arrested, after he killed a homeless man and faked his own death. He was one of the early members of the [[Anna Hazare]]-led [[2011 Indian anti-corruption movement|2011 anti-corruption movement]], and later the [[Aam Aadmi Party]] (AAP).&lt;ref name=toi/&gt;

== Killing and staged death ==
Sharma lived with his wife Savita and had an unhappy married life{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} &lt;sup&gt;[Check Grammar]&lt;/sup&gt;. In 2014, he decided to fake his own death so that he could start a new life with his 25-year-old girlfriend Preeti Nagar, who lived in the same neighbourhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/Chandra-Mohans-girlfriend-held-for-suppressing-facts/articleshow/41314844.cms |title=Chandra Mohan's girlfriend held for suppressing facts |date=31 August 2014 |newspaper=The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt; He convinced his brother-in-law Videsh to help him by suggesting that Savita would get money from insurance policies after his staged death. His employer Honda was obliged to pay his family {{INR}} 3,600,000 in case of his death; he had another [[life insurance policy]] worth {{INR}} 300,000.&lt;ref name="HT_admits"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rti-activist-thought-to-be-dead-arrested/article1-1257665.aspx |title=RTI activist and AAP member back from dead, admits he killed homeless man |date=29 August 2014 |newspaper=Hindustan Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, Sharma filed an RTI case against the alleged illegal encroachments on a temple land in Kasna village in Greater Noida. He claimed that he received threats to his life due to this, and filed a [[First Information Report]] (FIR) on 29 April, naming several persons for the threats.&lt;ref name=daily/&gt;&lt;ref name=ndtv/&gt; He became friendly with a mentally unstable [[homeless]] who used to roam around in the area of his residence. On 1 May 2014, Sharma [[manual strangulation|strangled]] the homeless man using a belt, with Videsh's help. The two put the dead body on the driver's seat of Sharma's [[Chevrolet Aveo]], poured three litres of petrol on it, and set the car on fire on a desolate stretch near Eldeco Crossing in Greater Noida. By the time the [[firefighter]]s arrived, the car had been badly burnt and the dead body had been charred beyond recognition.&lt;ref name="HT_admits"/&gt;&lt;ref name=toi&gt;{{cite web | title = Chandra Mohan Sharma: His RTIs 'did not please everyone' | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/City/Delhi/Chandra-Mohan-Sharma-His-RTIs-did-not-please-everyone/articleshow/34554861.cms |date=3 May 2014| accessdate = 3 May 2014 | publisher = The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt; The car windows and doors were locked, and had to be broken open.&lt;ref name=daily/&gt;

Meanwhile, Sharma's family tried to call him, but his mobile phone was unreachable. In the morning, Sharma's relatives identified the body as his, through the car's license plate. The police initially suspected that Sharma's car had caught fire, and he couldn't open the door due to a malfunction of the vehicle's [[central locking]].&lt;ref name="HT_took"&gt;{{cite web | title = RTI activist who took on Noida land mafia dies|newspaper=Hindustan Times| url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/noida/rti-activist-who-took-on-noida-land-mafia-dies-family-calls-it-murder/article1-1215024.aspx |date=3 May 2014| accessdate = 3 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sharma's relatives alleged that he was murdered for fighting against the land mafia, and accused the police of not acting on the FIR he had filed before his death.&lt;ref name=ndtv&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/cities/rti-activist-chandra-mohan-sharma-found-dead-in-his-car-in-noida-517434?curl=1399045662 |title=RTI Activist Chandra Mohan Sharma Found Dead in His Car in Noida |publisher=NDTV |date=2 May 2014 |accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PTI |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/rti-activist-chandra-mohan-sharma-found-dead-in-noida/article5969997.ece |title=RTI activist Chandra Mohan Sharma found dead in Noida |publisher=The Hindu |date=2 May 2014 |accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On complaint of a family member, the police lodged a murder case against five people at the Kasna police station.&lt;ref name="HT_took"/&gt;

== Investigation and arrest ==

Immediately after staging his own death, Sharma travelled to [[Bangalore]] by train. Subsequently, he assumed a new identity as "Nitin Sharma" and shaved his head. He managed to get a job at the Honda plant in Narsapur ([[Kolar district]], Karnataka), with help of forged [[marksheet]]s and past work experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/rti-activist-who-faked-his-death-arrested-for-murder/article6362725.ece?homepage=true |title=RTI activist, who faked his death, arrested for murder |author=Damini Nath |newspaper=The Hindu |date=29 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Honda paid {{INR}} 2,000,000 to Sharma's family.&lt;ref name="HT_admits"/&gt;

On 6 June, around a month after the incident, Sharma's girlfriend Preeti came to Kolar to live with him. Her family filed a [[missing person]] report. The police didn't know about the relationship between the two at this time, but while investigating the case, they found that the [[Subscriber identity module|SIM]] card of her mobile was registered in Sharma's name. By August 2014, Sharma had started finding his new life with Preeti financially taxing. He, therefore, made anonymous calls to her family, telling them about her location and asking them to take her back. The police traced the three calls made between 9 and 13 August to a [[Public call office|PCO]] in Bangalore, which is located at a distance of 50&amp;nbsp;km from the Honda plant in Narsapur. The investigators were told that a man in Honda uniform had made the calls. Using the [[CCTV]] footage and the Honda plant's employee records, they identified the caller as Chandra Mohan Sharma. When confronted, Sharma claimed that his name was Nitin and he was a native of [[Hisar (city)|Hisar]], Haryana. However, his real identity was confirmed by a tattoo on his hand with the names of his wife and children.&lt;ref name="HT_admits"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ToI_charged"/&gt;

Sharma was arrested on 27 August, in Bangalore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/dead-aap-activist-chandra-mohan-sharma-caught-alive-in-bangalore_1460856.html 'Dead' AAP activist Chandra Mohan Sharma caught alive in Bangalore]&lt;/ref&gt; The police also found Preeti, and the two were brought to Noida.&lt;ref name="ToI_charged"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/City/Noida/Murdered-RTI-activist-and-AAP-member-charged-with-murder/articleshow/41132551.cms |title='Murdered' RTI activist and AAP member charged with murder |author=Vandana Keelor |date=29 August 2014 |newspaper=The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt; He admitted that he had murdered a homeless man to stage his own death.&lt;ref name="HT_admits"/&gt;

'''Damage (Jaime Ortiz)''' is a [[fictional]] [[Character (arts)|character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is an enemy of the [[Punisher]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].

==Publication history==
Created by [[Carl Potts]] and [[Jim Lee]], the character made his first appearance in ''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' Vol. 1, #8 (September 1989),

Damage's first appearance was as a gang leader in ''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' Vol. 1, #8. After nearly dying in that issue, the character was rebuilt into a [[cyborg]] in a [[story arc]] that lasted from ''The Punisher War Journal'' Vol. 1, #17-20 to ''Wolverine and The Punisher: Damaging Evidence'' Vol. 1, #1-3.

Damage received a profile in ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe#Marvel Encyclopedias|Marvel Encyclopedia]]'' #5, which revealed his real name is Jaime Ortiz.

==Fictional character biography==
The head of a [[Manhattan]] street gang known as the Bunsen Burners, Damage became aware that the [[Punisher]] was after him, so he decided to make a preemptive strike against the vigilante by hijacking or destroying his Battle Van. While his underlings were killed by the Battle Van's automated defenses, Damage made it into the vehicle, where he was ensnared and crippled by its mechanical tentacles and coils. The trapped Damage was later found by the Punisher, who dropped him off at a hospital, having concluded that letting Damage live out the rest of his life in the mangled state he was in was punishment enough for him.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Carl Potts|penciller = Jim Lee|inker = Jim Lee|colorist = Gregory Wright|letterer = Jim Novak|editor = Don Daley|story = Damage|title = The Punisher War Journal|volume = 1|issue = #8|date = September 1989|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The Arranger, having been given the assignment of finding and recruiting new assassins for the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], discovered Damage through a newspaper article, and arranged for him to be moved to a private clinic, where surgeons set about reconstructing him into a [[cyborg]]. When Damage began to die on the operating table, the Arranger inspired him to continue fighting for survival by reminding him of his hatred for the Punisher.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Carl Potts|penciller = Jim Lee|inker = Don Hudson and Al Milgrom|colorist = Gregory Wright|letterer = Rich Parker|editor = Don Daley|story = Tropical Trouble|title = The Punisher War Journal|volume = 1|issue = #17|date = April 1990|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Carl Potts|penciller = Jim Lee|inker = Don Hudson and Al Milgrom|colorist = Gregory Wright|letterer = Rich Parker|editor = Don Daley|story = Kahuna|title = The Punisher War Journal|volume = 1|issue = #18|date = May 1990|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Carl Potts|penciller = Jim Lee|inker = Don Hudson and Al Milgrom|colorist = Gregory Wright|letterer = Rich Parker|editor = Don Daley|story = Trauma in Paradise|title = The Punisher War Journal|volume = 1|issue = #19|date = June 1990|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Carl Potts|penciller = Tod Smith|inker = Al Milgrom|colorist = Gregory Wright|letterer = Jim Novak|editor = Don Daley|story = The Debt|title = The Punisher War Journal|volume = 1|issue = #20|date = July 1990|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;

When Damage's transformation was completed, he was further augmented by [[Reavers (comics)|technology]] supplied by [[Donald Pierce]], and made to resemble the Punisher, in order to frame him for a series of murders. The killings drew the attention of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], who tracked Damage down to a chemical plant, where the two fought. Damage had the upper hand until the Punisher, who was preoccupied with the [[Sniper (comics)|Sniper]], appeared, and destroyed Damage by setting him ablaze, and knocking him into a vat, which exploded. The Kingpin had Damage's remains recovered, and sent them to Pierce, along with fifty million dollars to pay for his reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Carl Potts|penciller = Gary Erskine|inker = Gary Erskine|colorist = Marie Javins|letterer = John Gaushell and Richard Starkings|editor = Rob Tokar and Greg Wright|story = Part One|title = Wolverine and The Punisher: Damaging Evidence|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = October 1993|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Carl Potts|penciller = Gary Erskine|inker = Gary Erskine||colorist = Marie Javins|letterer = John Gaushell and Richard Starkings|editor = Rob Tokar and Greg Wrightstory|story = Part Two|title = Wolverine and The Punisher: Damaging Evidence|volume = 1|issue = #2|date = November 1993|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Carl Potts|penciller = Gary Erskine|inker = Gary Erskine|colorist = Garrahy, Javins, and Matthys|letterer = John Gaushell and Richard Starkings|editor = Rob Tokar and Greg Wright|story = Part Three|title = Wolverine and The Punisher: Damaging Evidence|volume = 1|issue = #3|date = December 1993|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
As a cyborg, Damage possessed superhuman strength and durability, as well as numerous retractable weapons such as a [[grenade launcher]], a [[flamethrower]], and a [[minigun]]. He also had [[infrared]] vision, and could electrocute others by touching them.

{{Garrison JFK investigation}}
'''David William Ferrie''' (March 28, 1918 – February 22, 1967) was an American [[aviator|pilot]] who was alleged by [[New Orleans]] [[District attorney|District Attorney]] [[Jim Garrison]] to have been involved in a [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy to assassinate President John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name="HSCv10"/&gt; Garrison also alleged that Ferrie knew [[Lee Harvey Oswald]]. Ferrie denied any involvement in a conspiracy and said he never knew Oswald.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=10477&amp;relPageId=288 FBI Interview of David Ferrie], November 25, 1963, Warren Commission Document 75, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; Decades later, photos emerged establishing that Ferrie had been in the same [[Civil Air Patrol]] unit as Oswald in the 1950s, but critics have argued this does not prove that either Ferrie or Oswald was involved in an assassination plot.&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"/&gt;

==Early life==
Ferrie was born in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. A [[Roman Catholic]], Ferrie attended [[Saint Ignatius High School (Cleveland, Ohio)|St. Ignatius High School]], [[John Carroll University]], St. Mary's Seminary, where he studied for the [[priesthood]], and [[Baldwin-Wallace College]]. He next spent three years at the [[St. Charles Seminary]] in [[Carthagena, Ohio]]. He suffered from [[alopecia areata]], a rare skin condition, which results in the loss of body hair and whose severity increases with age. Later in life, to compensate for his hair loss, Ferrie wore a reddish homemade wig and fake eyebrows.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0055b.htm David Ferrie], House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944 Ferrie left St. Charles because of "emotional instability."&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; He obtained a pilot's license and began teaching [[aeronautics]] at Cleveland's [[Benedictine High School (Ohio)|Benedictine High School]]. He was fired from the school for several infractions, including taking boys to a house of [[prostitution]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0056a.htm David Ferrie], House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; He then became an insurance inspector and, in 1951, moved to [[New Orleans]] where he worked as a pilot for [[Eastern Air Lines]], until losing his job in August 1961, after being arrested twice on morals charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0056a.htm David Ferrie], House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, pp. 107–108, 108–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferrie was involved with the [[Civil Air Patrol]] in several ways: He started as a Senior Member (an adult member) with the Fifth Cleveland Squadron at Hopkins Airport in 1947.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0056b.htm David Ferrie], House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; When he moved to [[New Orleans]], he transferred to the New Orleans Cadet Squadron at [[New Orleans Lakefront Airport|Lakefront Airport]]. There he served as an instructor, and later as the Commander.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; After a Ferrie-trained cadet pilot perished in a December 1954 crash, Ferrie's annual re-appointment was declined. He was asked to be a guest aerospace education instructor at a smaller squadron at [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport|Moisant Airport]], and lectured there from June to September 1955. On July 27, 1955, 15-year-old [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] joined this squadron.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol9/pdf/HSCA_Vol9_4_Oswald.pdf Oswald, David Ferrie and the Civil Air Patrol], House Select Committee on Assassinations, Volume 9, 4, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1958, a former cadet-turned-commander invited Ferrie back to the New Orleans Cadet Squadron. Ferrie served unofficially for a time and was reinstated as Executive Officer in September 1959. Ferrie quit the squadron in June 1960 after a disagreement during a [[Military camp|bivouac]]. In September 1960, he started his own unofficial squadron, called the [[Metairie]] Falcon Cadet Squadron.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0056b.htm David Ferrie], House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; An offshoot of this group was the Internal Mobile Security Unit, a group formed for the fight against [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="jfk-online.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfk-online.com/dbdfcapfile.html|title='David Blackburst Archive: David Ferrie: Civil Air Patrol File'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, he used both his official and unofficial squadrons to develop improper relations with boys ranging in age from 14 to 18, and his August 1961 arrests caused the Falcons to fold.&lt;ref name="jfk-online.com"/&gt;

Ferrie described himself as a [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] on [[civil rights]] issues, but he was "rabidly [[anti-Communist]]", often accusing previous U.S. Presidential administrations of "sell-outs" to [[communism]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt; Ferrie initially supported [[Fidel Castro]]'s campaign against [[Fulgencio Batista]] in Cuba, but by mid-1959 became convinced that Castro was a communist. According to the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]], Ferrie "...found an outlet for his political fanaticism in the [[anti-Castro]] movement." By early 1961, Ferrie was working with [[right-wing]] [[Cuban exile]] Sergio Arcacha Smith, head of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]-backed [[Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front]] in New Orleans. Ferrie soon became Arcacha Smith's "eager partner in [[counterrevolutionary]] activities." Both were involved in a raid in late 1961 on a munitions depot in [[Houma, Louisiana]], "...in which various weapons, grenades and ammunition were stolen."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0057a.htm David Ferrie], House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0066a.htm 544 Camp Street and Related Events], House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 13, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferrie often spoke to business and civic groups on political issues. In July 1961, Ferrie gave an anti-[[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] speech before the New Orleans chapter of the Military Order of World Wars, in which "his topic was the Presidential administration and the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] fiasco."&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt; In his speech, Ferrie attacked President Kennedy for refusing to provide air support to the Bay of Pigs invasion force of Cuban exiles.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=10477&amp;relPageId=201 FBI interview of David Ferrie], November 27, 1963, Warren Commission Document 75, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrie's tirade against Kennedy was so offensive that he was asked to leave the podium.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt; Ferrie admitted to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], after the assassination, that when speaking about Kennedy, he might have used the expression: "He ought to be shot." Ferrie insisted, however, that these words were just "an off-hand or colloquial expression."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

In the early 1960s, Ferrie became involved with [[Guy Banister]], former [[Special Agent In Charge]] (SAC) of the Chicago office of the FBI, [[right-wing]] political activist, [[segregationist]], and [[private investigator]]. Banister also worked with Ferrie's associate, Sergio Arcacha Smith. In early 1962, both Banister and Arcacha Smith maintained offices in the Newman Building at the corner address of 544 Camp Street / 531 Lafayette Street, New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0057b.htm David Ferrie], House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1962, Banister assisted Ferrie in his dispute with Eastern Airlines regarding "...charges brought [against Ferrie] by the airline and local New Orleans police of [[crime against nature|crimes against nature]] and [[extortion]]."&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"/&gt; During this period, Ferrie was often seen at Banister's office.&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0058a.htm David Ferrie], House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Banister testified to Ferrie's "good character" at an airline pilot's grievance board hearing in the summer of 1963.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated14" /&gt;

According to several witnesses, Ferrie and Banister also worked together in the fall of 1963 for lawyer [[G. Wray Gill]], on behalf of Gill's client, [[New Orleans Mafia]] boss [[Carlos Marcello]], in an attempt to block Marcello's deportation to [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated8" /&gt; On a related matter, the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] stated that "An unconfirmed Border Patrol report of February 1962 alleges that Ferrie was the pilot who flew Carlos Marcello back into the United States from Guatemala after he had been deported in April 1961 as part of the [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[Robert Kennedy]]'s crackdown on organized crime."&lt;ref name="autogenerated12"&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0058b.htm David Ferrie], House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Another report, this one by the FBI, "...indicated Marcello offered [Ferrie associate Sergio] Arcacha Smith a deal whereby Marcello would make a substantial donation to the [anti-Castro] movement in return for concessions in Cuba after Castro's overthrow."&lt;ref name="autogenerated12" /&gt;

==Allegations of involvement in the Kennedy assassination==
On the afternoon of November 22, 1963 – the day [[John F. Kennedy]] was assassinated and the day Carlos Marcello was acquitted in his deportation case – New Orleans private investigator [[Guy Banister]] and one of his employees, [[Jack Martin (investigator)|Jack Martin]], were drinking together at a local bar. On their return to Banister's office, the two men got into a heated argument. According to Martin, Banister said something to which Martin replied, "What are you going to do – kill me like you all did Kennedy?" Banister drew his .357 magnum revolver and [[pistol whip|pistol-whipped]] Martin several times. Martin, badly injured, went by ambulance to [[Charity Hospital (New Orleans)|Charity Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0067b.htm 544 Camp Street and Related Events], House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 13, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ensuing days, Jack Martin told reporters and authorities that David Ferrie might have been involved in the assassination. Martin told the New Orleans police that Ferrie "was supposed to have been the getaway pilot in the assassination."&lt;ref name="HSCv10"&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0058b.htm David Ferrie], House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; He said that Ferrie had threatened Kennedy's life, even outlining plans to kill him, and that Ferrie might have taught Oswald how to use a rifle with a telescopic sight. Martin also claimed that Ferrie had known Oswald from their days in the New Orleans Civil Air Patrol, and that he had seen a photograph, at Ferrie's home, of Oswald in a Civil Air Patrol group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=10477&amp;relPageId=219 FBI Interview of Jack S. Martin], November 25, 1963 &amp; November 27, 1963, Warren Commission Document 75, pp. 217–218, 309–311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin's accusations soon got back to Ferrie, who contacted several of his former Civil Air Patrol associates. Former cadet Roy McCoy told the FBI that "Ferrie had come by looking for photographs of the cadets to see if Oswald was pictured in any photos of Ferrie's squadron."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0059b.htm David Ferrie], House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Martin also told [[bail bondsman]] Hardy Davis that he had heard on television that Ferrie's New Orleans library card had been found in Oswald's possession when he was arrested in [[Dallas]]. Davis reported this to Ferrie's employer, the lawyer [[G. Wray Gill]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=10477&amp;relPageId=218 FBI interview of W. Hardy Davis], November 27, 1963, Warren Commission Document 75, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; (In fact, no such library card was found among Oswald's possessions.)&lt;ref&gt;Warren Report, Appendix 11: Reports Relating to the Interrogation of Lee Harvey Oswald at the Dallas Police Department, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wr/html/WCReport_0320a.htm Reports of Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation].

Martin also claimed that Ferrie had driven from New Orleans to [[Texas]] on the night of the assassination. When questioned by the FBI, Ferrie stated that he and two friends drove {{convert|350|mi|km}} to the Winterland Skating Rink in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], about {{convert|240|mi|km}} from [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], that evening. Ferrie said that "...he had been considering for some time the feasibility and possibility of opening an ice skating rink in New Orleans" and wanted to gather information on the ice rink business. "He stated that he introduced himself to [rink manager] Chuck Rolland and spoke with him at length concerning the cost of installation and operation of the rink."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=10477&amp;relPageId=290 FBI Interview of David Ferrie], November 25, 1963, Warren Commission Document 75, pp. 288–289.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rolland said that he never spoke to Ferrie about running an ice rink. Rolland said that Ferrie had spent his time at the rink's pay phone, making and receiving calls.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Summers|Summers, Anthony]]. ''Not in Your Lifetime'', (New York: Marlowe &amp; Company, 1998), p. 351. {{ISBN|1-56924-739-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 25, Martin was contacted by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]. Martin told the [[FBI]] that Ferrie might have [[hypnosis|hypnotized]] Oswald into assassinating Kennedy. The FBI considered Martin's evidence unreliable. Nevertheless, FBI agents interviewed Ferrie twice about Martin's allegations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=10477&amp;relPageId=287 FBI Interview of David Ferrie], November 25, 1963 &amp; November 27, 1963, Warren Commission Document 75, pp. 285–297, 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrie claimed that in June 1963, he had been involved in an altercation with Martin, in which he had thrown Martin out of the office of lawyer G. Wray Gill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=10477&amp;relPageId=295 FBI DeBrueys Report of 02 Dec 1963 re: Oswald/Russia], November 25, 1963, Warren Commission Document 75, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI also interviewed about twenty other people in connection with Martin's allegations. The FBI said that it was unable to develop a substantial case against Ferrie. An inquiry by the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]], conducted a decade and a half later, concluded that the FBI's "...overall investigation of the 544 Camp Street issue at the time of the assassination was not thorough."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0065b.htm 544 Camp Street and Related Events], House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 13, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Ciravolo.jpg|thumb|right|David Ferrie (second from left) and a teenaged Lee Harvey Oswald (far right) in a group photo of the New Orleans Civil Air Patrol in 1955 (click to enlarge)]]

Some of this information reached [[Jim Garrison]], the district attorney of New Orleans, who had become increasingly interested in the assassination after a chance meeting with [[Louisiana]] Senator [[Russell Long]] in late 1966. Garrison said that Long told him: "Those fellows on the Warren Commission were dead wrong. There's no way in the world that one man could have shot up Jack Kennedy that way."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Talbot|Talbot, David]]. ''Brothers: The Hidden History of the Kennedy Years'', (London: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2007), p. 319. {{ISBN|978-0-7432-6918-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Garrison|Garrison, Jim]]. ''[[On the Trail of the Assassins]]'', (New York: Sheridan Square Press, 1988), p. 13. {{ISBN|0-941781-02-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1966, Garrison interviewed Jack Martin. Martin claimed that during the summer of 1963, David Ferrie, [[Guy Banister]], Lee Harvey Oswald, and a group of anti-Castro Cuban exiles were involved in operations against Castro's Cuba that included gun running activities and burglarizing armories.&lt;ref name="Garrison 1988 p. 40"&gt;Garrison 1988 p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Garrison would later write: "The Banister apparatus ... was part of a supply line that ran along the Dallas–New Orleans–Miami corridor. These supplies consisted of arms and explosives for use against Castro's Cuba."&lt;ref name="Garrison 1988 p. 40"/&gt;

According to testimony by Banister's personal secretary, Delphine Roberts, Ferrie and Oswald were frequent visitors to Banister's office in 1963. She remembered Ferrie as "one of the agents." "Many times when he came into the office he used the private office behind Banister's, and I was told he was doing private work. I believed his work was somehow connected with the [[CIA]] rather than the FBI..."&lt;ref name="Summers 1998 p. 233"&gt;Summers 1998 p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; The [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] investigated Roberts' claims and said that "because of contradictions in Roberts' statements to the committee and lack of independent corroboration of many of her statements, the reliability of her statements could not be determined."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0067a.htm 544 Camp Street and Related Events], House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 8, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Garrison continued his investigation, he became convinced that a group of right-wing extremists, including Ferrie, Banister, and [[Clay Shaw]], were involved in a [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] with elements of the CIA to kill John F. Kennedy. Garrison would later claim that the motive for the assassination was anger over Kennedy's attempts to obtain a peace settlement in both Cuba and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="Jim Garrison Interview"&gt;[http://www.jfklancer.com/Garrison2.html Jim Garrison Interview], ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, Eric Norden, October 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrison 1988 pp. 12–13, 43, 176–178, 277, 293&lt;/ref&gt; Garrison also believed that Shaw, Banister, and Ferrie had conspired to set up Oswald as a patsy in the JFK assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Garrison 1988 pp. 26–27, 62, 70, 106–110, 250, 278, 289&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:3330LAAveParkwayNOLAJune2009.JPG|right|thumb|Ferrie lived in the upstairs of this two story house located on Louisiana Avenue Parkway in the [[Broadmoor, New Orleans|Broadmoor section]] of New Orleans.]]

On February 22, 1967, less than a week after the ''New Orleans States-Item'' broke the story of Jim Garrison's investigation, Ferrie was found dead in his apartment.&lt;ref name="The Gadsen Times; February 23, 1967"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Ferrie, JFK Probe Data Linked |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&amp;dat=19670221&amp;id=EKsfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BtcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1070,2870290 |newspaper=The Gadsen Times |location=Gadsen, Alabama |publisher= |agency=UPI |pages=1–2 |date=February 23, 1967 |accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two unsigned, undated typed letters were found at Ferrie's apartment: The first, found in a pile of papers, was a screed about the justice system, beginning with "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect."&lt;ref name=bugliosi&gt;Bugliosi 2007 p.1401&lt;/ref&gt; The second note was written to Al Beauboeuf, Ferrie's friend to whom he bequeathed all his possessions.&lt;ref name=bugliosi/&gt; Garrison said he considered Ferrie's death a suicide, but added "I am not ruling out murder."&lt;ref name="The Gadsen Times; February 23, 1967"/&gt; Garrison's aide, Lou Ivon, stated that Ferrie telephoned him the day after the story of Garrison's investigation broke and told him, "You know what this news story does to me, don't you. I'm a dead man. From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man...."&lt;ref&gt;Garrison 1988 p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferrie's autopsy was performed by [[Orleans Parish]] [[coroner]] Nicholas Chetta and [[pathologist]] Ronald A.

==Allegations regarding a relationship between Ferrie and Lee Harvey Oswald==
In 1979, the [[HSCA|House Select Committee on Assassinations]] stated in its Final Report that Oswald – who had been living in New Orleans in the summer of 1963 – had established contact with anti-Castro Cubans&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0082b.htm HSCA Final Assassinations Report], House Select Committee on Assassinations, pp. 134–147.&lt;/ref&gt; and "apparently" with American anti-Castro activist, David Ferrie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0089a.htm HSCA Final Assassinations Report], House Select Committee on Assassinations, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee also found "credible and significant" the testimony of six witnesses who placed Oswald and Ferrie in [[Clinton, Louisiana|Clinton]], Louisiana, in September 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0086b.htm HSCA Final Assassinations Report], House Select Committee on Assassinations, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the witnesses was [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE) chairman Corrie Collins. Collins identified a photograph of David Ferrie at the [[trial of Clay Shaw]], saying, "...but the most outstanding thing about him [Ferrie] was his eyebrows and his hair. They didn't seem real, in other words, they were unnatural, didn't seem as if they were real hair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfk-online.com/collins.html |title=John F.

In 1993, the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] television program ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' obtained a group photograph, taken eight years before the assassination, that showed Oswald and Ferrie at a cookout with other Civil Air Patrol cadets.&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/glimpse/ferrie.html PBS ''Frontline'' "Who Was Lee Harvey Oswald"], broadcast on PBS stations, November 1993 (various dates).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Frontline'' executive producer Michael Sullivan said, "one should be cautious in ascribing its meaning. The photograph does give much support to the eyewitnesses who say they saw Ferrie and Oswald together in the C.A.P., and it makes Ferrie's denials that he ever knew Oswald less credible. But it does not prove that the two men were with each other in 1963, nor that they were involved in a conspiracy to kill the president."&lt;ref name="autogenerated11" /&gt; Author [[John C. McAdams]] wrote: "The photo doesn't prove that they ever met or talked to each other, but only that they were in the organization at the same time."&lt;ref name=McAdams&gt;{{cite book|last=McAdams|first=John|authorlink=John C.

'''Debby''' (1966 &amp;ndash; November 17, 2008) was a female [[polar bear]], considered by scholars as the world's oldest. She lived in the [[Assiniboine Park Zoo]] in [[Winnipeg]]. In August 2008, the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' certified her as not only the oldest polar bear, but one of the three oldest individuals ever recorded of all eight bear species.

Debby was born in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Arctic]] in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/tributes-pour-in-after-oldest-polar-bear-dies-in-winnipeg-1.724601 Tributes pour in after oldest polar bear dies in Winnipeg] from [[CBC.ca]]; published November 18, 2008; retrieved September 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently orphaned; she arrived in Winnipeg when she was a year old.

While in captivity, she had six cubs with her mate Skipper.&lt;ref name=Oldest&gt; https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2008/11/18/oldest_polar_bear_in_captivity_dies.html Oldest polar bear in captivity dies], by Chinta Puxley, in the ''[[Toronto Star]]''; published November 18, 2008; retrieved August 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, she was found to have [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome]], and was subsequently [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]]. She was 42 years old.

Dark green religion: Nature spirituality and the planetary future. Univ of California Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents may come from a range of faiths including: [[Islam]]; [[Jainism]]; [[Christianity]] ([[Catholicism]], [[Evangelicalism]] and [[Orthodox Christianity]]); [[Judaism]]; [[Buddhism]] and Indigenous traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ritz|first=Janet|title=Thoughts on Eco-Spirituality|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/janet-ritz/thoughts-on-ecospirituali_b_63595.html|accessdate=7 January 2014|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=8 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although many of their practices and beliefs may differ, a central claim is that there is "a spiritual dimension to our present ecological crisis."&lt;ref name=Vaughan2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Vaughan-Lee|first=Llewellyn|title=Eco-spirituality: towards a values-based economic structure|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/eco-spirituality-values-based-economic-structure|accessdate=7 January 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the environmentalist Sister Virginia Jones, "Eco-spirituality is about helping people experience 'the holy' in the natural world and to recognize their relationship as human beings to all creation.&lt;ref name=Bonfiglio /&gt;

Ecospirituality has been influenced by the ideas of [[deep ecology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aburrow|first=Yvonne|title=Eco-spirituality and theology|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/sermonsfromthemound/2013/01/eco-spirituality-and-theology/|work=Sermons from the Mound|publisher=Pantheos|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eco-spirituality|url=http://www.acton.org/public-policy/environmental-stewardship/eco-spirituality|publisher=Acton Institute|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is characterized by "recognition of the inherent value of all living beings and the use of this view in shaping environmental policies" &lt;ref&gt;Drengson, Alan. 2012. "Some Thought on the Deep Ecology Movement." Foundation for Deep Ecology. http://www.deepecology.org/deepecology.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to [[ecopsychology]], it refers to the connections between the science of ecology and the study of psychology.  'Earth-based' spirituality is another term related to ecospirituality; it is associated with pagan religious traditions and the work of prominent ecofeminist, [[Starhawk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blumberg|first=Antonia|title=Celebrate The Winter Solstice With Los Angeles' Own Eco-Pagans|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/11/starhawk-los-angeles-ritual_n_4390396.html|accessdate=7 January 2014|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecospirituality refers to the intertwining of intuition and bodily awareness pertaining to a relational view between human beings and the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals2.scholarsportal.info/pdf/08980101/v18i0003/227_e.xml|publisher = American Holistic Nurses' Association|last = Lincoln|first = Valerie|page = 227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Ecospirituality finds its history in the relationship between spirituality and the environment. Some scholars say it "flows from an understanding of cosmology or the story of the origin of the universe."  &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Delaney|first1 = Colleen|title = Ecospirituality: The Experience of Environmental Meditation in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease|journal = Holistic Nursing Practice|volume = 23|issue=6|pages = 362}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple origin stories about how the spiritual relationship with people and the environment began. In [[Indigenous American philosophy|Native America philosophy]], there are many unique stories of how spirituality came to be. A common theme in a number of them is the discussion of a Great Spirit that lives within the universe and the earth represents its presence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Ecospirituality has also sprung from a reaction to the Western world's materialism and consumerism, characterized by ecotheologian [[Thomas Berry]] as a "crisis of cosmology."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Scholars have argued that "the modern perspective is based on science and focused on the human self with everything else being outside, resulting in the demise of the metaphysical world and the disenchantment with the cosmos." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Therefore, ecospirituality originates as a rebuttal to the emphasis on the material as well as Western separation from the environment, where the environment is regarded as a set of material resources with primarily instrumental value.

== Ecological crisis ==
Ecospirituality became popularized due to a need for a reconceptualization of the human relationship with the environment. Terms such as environmental crisis, ecological crisis, climate change, global warming all refer to an ongoing global issue that needs to be addressed. Generally the ecological crisis is referring to the destruction of the earth’s ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ecological Crisis|url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199680856.001.0001/acref-9780199680856-e-999|doi = 10.1093/acref/9780199680856.001.0001/acref-9780199680856-e-999|last = Mayhew|first = Susan|date = 2015|journal = A Dictionary of Geography|publisher = Oxford Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt; What this encompasses is a highly controversial debate in scientific and political spheres.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Climate Change?|url = http://www.davidsuzuki.org/issues/climate-change/science/climate-change-basics/climate-change-101-1/|website = David Suzuki Foundation|accessdate = 2015-12-07|date = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally we are faced with pollution of our basic needs (air, and water) as well as the depletion of important resources, most notably food resources.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Annette Van Schalkwyk refers to the environmental crisis as “man-made”.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It is arguably the result of a “mechanistic and capitalistic world view”.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Whether it is man-made, or as some argue, a natural occurrence, humans are not helping. Pollution and depletion of resources play a major role in the ecological crisis.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Bringing religion into the ecological crisis is controversial due to the divide between religion and science. Ecospirituality is prepared to acknowledge science, and work in tandem with religion to frame the environment as a sacred entity in need of protection.

Mary Evelyn Tucker notes the importance of religion and ecology connecting with sustainability. Due to the environmental crisis, perceptions of [[sustainability]] are changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = World Religions, the Earth Charter, and Sustainability|url = http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/156853508x359930;jsessionid=c0hosllagal8n.x-brill-live-02|journal = Worldviews: Global Religions, Culture, and Ecology|date = 2008-11-01|issn = 1568-5357|pages = 115–128|volume = 12|issue = 2|doi = 10.1163/156853508X359930|first = Mary Evelyn|last = Tucker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion and ecology, and the way people experience ecospirituality, could contribute to this changing definition of sustainability.

== Research on ecospirituality ==

Ecospirituality has been studied by academics in order to understand a clearer definition of what individuals label as ecospirituality and the framework in which they create this definition. One study focused on [[Holistic nursing|holistic nurses]], who themselves characterize their profession as having a fundamentally spiritual nature and a sense of the importance of the environment.&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"&gt;Lincoln, Valerie (September 2000).  American Holistic Nurses' Association. p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers performed a phenomenological study where they assessed the nurses' ecospiritual consciousness. For the purpose of their study, they defined ecospiritual consciousness as "accessing a deep awareness of one's ecospiritual relationship."&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"/&gt; They then narrowed down their findings to the five principles of ecospiritual consciousness, which are: tending, dwelling, reverence, connectedness, and sentience.&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"/&gt;
# Tending was defined as "being awake and conscious," with "deep, inner self-reflection."&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"/&gt;
# Dwelling was defined as "a process of being with the seen and the unseen."&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"/&gt;
# Reverence was defined as "rediscovering the mystery present present in all creation and is embodied sense of the sacred," focusing on the earth.&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"/&gt;
# Connectedness was defined as an "organic relationship with the universe." &lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"/&gt;
# Sentience was defined as "a sense of knowing."&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"/&gt;
Another study looked at medical effects of ecospirituality by having patients with cardiovascular disease practice "environmental meditation" and log regular journal entries about their experiences.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Delaney, Colleen. "Ecospirituality: The Experience of Environmental Meditation in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease". Holistic Nursing Practice. 23(6): 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers started out with the research question of, ''"What is the essence of the experience of ecospirituality meditation in patients with CVD?"'' CVD is an acronym for [[Cardiovascular Disease|cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; From analyzing journal entries of participants, researchers abstracted four major themes of ecospirituality meditation: entering a new time zone, environmental reawakening, finding a new rhythm, and the creation of a healing environment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;
# Entering a new time zone was described by researchers as "the expansion of time during meditation."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Delaney, Colleen. "Ecospirituality: The Experience of Environmental Meditation in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease". Holistic Nursing Practice. 23(6): 366.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Environmental Reawakening was described by researchers as "opened participants’ eyes to vistas not previously noticed"&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
# Finding a new rhythm was described by the researchers as "enhanced relationships with their family, friends, coworkers, and even their pets."&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Delaney, Colleen. "Ecospirituality: The Experience of Environmental Meditation in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease". Holistic Nursing Practice. 23(6): 367.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The creation of a healing environment was described by the researchers as "With raised consciousnesses, they became aware of the choices they had regarding what types of intentions and energy that wanted to put out in their environment"&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
This research was driven by the goal of raising awareness among healthcare professionals about ecospirituality and the medical importance of both self and environmental consciousness. Anecdotal evidence showed a decrease in [[blood pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;Delaney, Colleen. "Ecospirituality: The Experience of Environmental Meditation in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease". Holistic Nursing Practice. 23(6): 368.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the psychological benefits of environmental meditation were the main focus for the researchers.

==Dark Green Religion==

Dark Green Religion is one way in which people, both secular and religious, connect with nature on a spiritual level.  [[Bron Taylor]] defines Dark Green Religion as "religion that considers nature to be sacred, imbued by intrinsic value, and worthy of reverent care" in his book ''Dark Green Religion: Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future.'' &lt;ref name="Taylor, Bron 2009"&gt;Taylor, Bron. "Dark green religion." Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future. UC Berkeley (2009). xi.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Nature religion]] is an overarching term of which Dark Green Religion is a part of. A key part of Dark Green Religion is the "depth of its consideration of nature." &lt;ref name="Taylor, Bron 2009"/&gt;
Dark Green Religion differs from Green Religion. Green Religion claims that it is a religious obligation for humans to be environmental stewards, while Dark Green Religion is a movement that simply holds nature as valuable and sacred.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Bron. "Dark green religion." Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future. UC Berkeley (2009). 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
Spiritual types of Dark Green Religion include [[Spiritual naturalism|Naturalistic]] and [[Supernatural]]istic forms of [[Animism]] and of [[Gaianism]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Taylor, Bron. "Dark green religion." Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future. UC Berkeley (2009). 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The diverse views within Dark Green Religion are not without the idea that the earth is sacred and worthy of care. The perceptions of Dark Green Religion are global and flexible. Taylor's use of the word 'Dark' gestures toward these negative possibilities. According to Taylor, Dark Green Religion has the possibility to "inspire the emergence of a global, civic, earth religion."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Bron. "Dark green religion." Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future. UC Berkeley (2009). x.&lt;/ref&gt; Dark Green, Green and Nature Religions are arguably all a part of ecospirituality. The term ecospirituality is versatile and overarching.

==Ecofeminism and spirituality==
The umbrella term "ecospirituality" covers the feminist theology called [[Ecofeminism]].&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"&gt;Elizabeth A Johnson on Ecofeminism (Burke Lecture: An Ecological Inquiry – Jesus and the Cosmos) University of California Television, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ecofeminism was first coined by the French writer Françoise D'Eaubonne in her book, ''Le Féminisme ou la Mort'' in order to name the connection between the patriarchal subjugation of women and the destruction of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, Anne. ''Introducing Feminist Theology''. Marknoll: Orbis Books: 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, she argues that women have different ways of seeing and relating to the world than men.&lt;ref name="Annie L. Booth 1999"&gt;Does the Spirit Move You? Environmental Spirituality – Annie L. Booth, Faculty of Natural Resources and Environmental Studies University of Northern British Columbia, Environmental Values Vol. 8, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; These differences can give rise alternative insights on interactions between humans and the natural world when women's perspectives are considered.&lt;ref name="Annie L. Booth 1999"/&gt; The suppression and control of woman and the natural world are connected.&lt;ref name="Annie L. Booth 1999"/&gt; On the ecofeminist view, women are controlled because they are thought to be closer to primitive nature.&lt;ref name="Annie L. Booth 1999"/&gt; By understanding the connection between femininity and nature and by exploring feminine ways of seeing and relating, ecofeminism asserts that humans can realize positive ways of interacting with the natural world and with each other.&lt;ref name="Annie L. Booth 1999"/&gt;

=== Ecofeminism and Christianity on the ecological crisis ===
A significant figure in Christian ecofeminism is [[Rosemary Radford Ruether]]. Ruether argues that feminism and ecology share a common vision, even though they use different languages.&lt;ref name="Ruether, Rosemary Radford 1992"&gt;Ruether, Rosemary Radford. ''Gaia and God: An Ecofeminist Theology of Earth Healing.'' San Francisco: HarperCollins, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; In her work, ''Gaia and God: An Ecofeminist Theology of Earth Healing'' Ruether provides three recommendations on ways to move forward with repairing and "healing" the ecological crisis.&lt;ref name="Ruether, Rosemary Radford 1992"/&gt; The first recommendation is that "the ecological crisis needs to be seen not just as a crisis in the health of nonhuman ecosystems, polluted water, contaminated skies, threatened climate change, deforestation, extinction of species, important as all these realities are. Rather one needs to see the interconnections between the impoverishment of the earth and the impoverishment of human groups, even as others are enriching themselves to excess."&lt;ref name="Ruether, Rosemary Radford 1992"/&gt; The second recommendation is that "a healed ecosystem – humans, animals, land, air, and water together – needs to be understood as requiring a new way of life, not just a few adjustments here and there."&lt;ref name="Ruether, Rosemary Radford 1992"/&gt; The third and final recommendation is that the need for a new vision is necessary: "one needs to nurture the emergence of a new planetary vision and communal ethic that can knit together people across religions and cultures. There is rightly much dismay at the role that religions are playing in right-wing politics and even internecine violence today. But we need also to recognize the emergence of new configurations of inter-religious relations."&lt;ref name="Ruether, Rosemary Radford 1992"/&gt;

===Ecofeminism and Christianity in liberation theology ===
According to [[Ivone Gebara]], in Latin America, particularly in Christian Churches in Brazil, it is difficult to be a feminist, but more difficult to be an ecofeminist.&lt;ref name="Gebara, Ivone 2003"&gt;Gebara, Ivone. “Ecofeminism: A Latin American Perspective.” Crosscurrents, Spring 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Gebara explains ecology as one of the "deepest concerns of feminism and ecology as having a deep resonance or a political and anthropolocial consequence from a feminist perspective."&lt;ref name="Gebara, Ivone 2003"/&gt; Gebara believes that it is the task of different groups of Latin American women to "provide a new order of meaning including marginalized people."&lt;ref name="Gebara, Ivone 2003"/&gt; This task is both challenging and political. Gebara says: "We can choose the life of the planet and the respect of all living beings or we choose to die by our own bad decisions."&lt;ref name="Gebara, Ivone 2003"/&gt;

Paganism is a nature-based religion that exists in a multitude of forms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Introduction to Pagan Studies|last = Davy|first = Barbara Jane|publisher = |year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no official doctrine or sacred text that structures its practice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to its lack of structure, many Pagans believe that it should be used as a tool to combat the current ecological crisis because it is flexible and can adapt to the environment's needs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thegreenfuse.org/harris/sacredeco.htm|title = Sacred Ecology|date = |accessdate = |website = The Green Fuse|publisher = |last = Collins|first = Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecospirituality advocates contend that an ecology-based religion that focuses on the nurturing and healing of the earth is necessary in modernity.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sacredness and Sustainability: Searching for a Practical Eco-Spirituality|last = Van Schalkwyk|first = Annalet|date = 2011|journal = Religion and Theology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As paganism is already based in nature worship, many believe it would be a useful starting point for ecospirituality.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ecopagan.com/|title = A Pagan Community Statement on the Environment|date = |accessdate = |website = Ecopagan|publisher = |last = Halstead|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, [[Modern Paganism|neopagan]] revivals have seen the emergence of pagan communities that are more earth-focused. They may build their rituals around advocacy for a sustainable lifestyle and emphasize complete interconnectedness with the earth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Paganism understands divine figures to exist not as transcendent beings, but as immanent beings in the present realm,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; meaning that their divine figures exist within each of us, and within nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many pagans believe in ''interconnectedness'' among all living beings, which allows them to foster moments of self-reflection before acting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These pagan ideals coincide with ecospirituality because pagans understand the environment to be part of the divine realm and part of their inner self. Therefore, in their view, harming the environment directly affects their wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cicministry.org/scholarly/sch012.htm|title = Neo-paganism and Environmental Ethics|date = 1995|accessdate = |website = Critical Issues Commentary Scholarly|publisher = |last = DeWaay|first = Bob}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pagans have already recognized the importance of incorporating environmental ideologies with their own religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.religionandnature.com/ern/sample/Harris--Dragon.pdf|title = Dragon Environmental Network|date = 2005|accessdate = |website = Religion and Nature|publisher = London &amp; New York: Continuum|last = Taylor|first = Bron}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dragon Environmental Network is a pagan community based in the UK. They are committed to practicing "eco-magic" with the intention of recognizing the earth as sacred and divine.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Their four goals are as follows:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
# Increase general awareness of the sacredness of the Earth.
# Encourage pagans to become involved in conservation work.
# Encourage pagans to become involved in environmental campaigns.
# Develop the principles and practice of magical and spiritual action for the environment.  
Paganism combines religion with environmental activism. Pagans organize protests, campaigns, and petitions with the environment in mind while staying true to their religious beliefs.  [[Bron Taylor]], argues that their core Pagan beliefs greatly improves their environmental activism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally, the Pagan community has recently released a statement on the ecological crisis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It explains that Pagans lead lives that foster “harmony with the rhythms of our great Earth" and that they view the Earth as their equal in stating “we are neither above nor separate from the rest of nature”. It states that we are part of a web of life, and are fully interconnected with the biosphere. This connection to all living beings is seen as spiritual and sacred. And in turn it provides a framework that Pagans can use to combine their religious beliefs with environmental activism. It calls for a return to ancient understandings of the earth by listening to ancient wisdom. It asks Pagans to practice their religion in all aspects of their lives in order to give the Earth room to heal. The statement concludes by stating “building a truly sustainable culture means transforming the systems of domination and exploitation that threaten our future into systems of symbiotic partnership that support our ecosystems”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Ecospirituality and Christianity ===
Most Christian theology has centered on the doctrine of creation.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt; According to [[Elizabeth Johnson (theologian)|Elizabeth Johnson]], in recent years, this has led to growing ecological awareness among Christians.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt; The logic of this stance is rooted in the theological idea that since God created the world freely, it has an intrinsic value and is worthy of our respect and care.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt; In 1990, [[Pope John Paul II]] wrote a letter on ecological issues.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt; He concluded the letter with a discussion of Christian belief and how it should lead to ethical care of the earth.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt; He ended the letter with the principle "respect for life and the dignity of human person must extend also to the rest of creation."&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt;

The doctrines of Christ that Christians follow also have the potential for ecological spirituality for they support interpretations that are consistent with ecospirituality.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt; According to Elizabeth Johnson, Jesus' view of the Kingdom of God included earthly wellbeing.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt;  According to [[Thomas Berry]], Christians recognize a need for an Earth Ethic.&lt;ref name="Berry, Thomas 2009"&gt;Berry, Thomas. ''The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth.'' Orbis Books: New York, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, leader of the Greek Orthodox Church, has organized major religion and science symposia on water issues across Europe, the Amazon River and Greenland.&lt;ref name="Berry, Thomas 2009"/&gt; He has issued statements – including a joint statement with John Paul II in 2002 – calling destruction of the environment "ecological sin."&lt;ref name="Berry, Thomas 2009"/&gt;  Bishop Malone, president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops has said: "The Church stands in need of a new symbolic and affective system through which to proclaim the Gospel to the modern world."&lt;ref name="Thomas Berry 1985, page 26"&gt;Thomas Berry, "Christian Cosmology." ''The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth'', 1985, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ecotheology of the late [[Thomas Berry]], he argues that Christians often fail to realize that both their social and religious wellbeing depend on the wellbeing of Earth.&lt;ref name="Thomas Berry 1985, page 26"/&gt; Earth provides sustenance for physical, imaginative and emotions, and religious wellbeing.&lt;ref name="Thomas Berry 1985, page 26"/&gt; In Thomas Berry's view, the Christian future will depend on the ability of Christians to assume their responsibility for Earth's fate.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Berry, "The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth," ''The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth'', 1989, page 35.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such responsibility-taking can be seen in the founding of an association called "Sisters of Earth," which is made up of nuns and laywomen.&lt;ref name="Thomas Berry 1994, page 78"&gt;Thomas Berry, "Women Religious: Voices of Earth," ''The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth'', 1994, page 78.&lt;/ref&gt; This network of women from diverse religious communities is significant, both for the movement of general concern for the natural world and for the religious life in Christian contexts.&lt;ref name="Thomas Berry 1994, page 78"/&gt;

=== Ecospirituality and Hinduism  ===

Many teachings in [[Hinduism]] are intertwined with the ethics of ecospirituality in their stress on environmental wellbeing. The Hindu text called the ''[[Taittiriya Upanishad|Taittariya Upanishad]]'' refers to creation as offspring of the Supreme Power, ''[[paramatman]]''. Thus, the environment is related to something that is divine and therefore deserves respect.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb, Roger S. 2006"/&gt; Since the late 1980s when the negative effects of mass industrialization were becoming popularized, India instituted administrative policies to deal with environmental conservation. These policies were rooted in the ways that the Hindu religion is tied to the land.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb, Roger S. 2006"/&gt;

In the Hindu text ''Vajur Veda'' (32.10), God is described as being present in all living things, further reinforcing the need to show respect for creation.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb, Roger S. 2006"/&gt; Passages such as this lead some Hindus to become [[vegetarians|vegetarian]] and to affirm a broader type of ecospiritual connection to the Earth. ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' 3.8.15. states that, "God, Kesava, is pleased with a person who does not harm or destroy other non-speaking creatures or animals." &lt;ref name="Gottlieb, Roger S. 2006"/&gt; This notion is tied in with the Hindu concept of [[Karma in Hinduism|karma]]. Karma means that the pain caused to other living things will come back to you through the process of [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb, Roger S. 2006"/&gt;

Ecospirituality can also be seen in the ''Prithivi Sukta'' which is a "Hymn to Mother Earth."&lt;ref name="Gottlieb, Roger S. 2006"/&gt; In this text, the Earth is humanized into a spiritual being to which humans have familial ties. Through ecospirituality, the notion of praising and viewing the Earth in this way brings about its strong connections to Hinduism.

===Ecospirituality and Jainism===

Contemporary [[Jainism|Jaina faith]] is “inherently ecofriendly.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Key Chapple|first1=Christopher|editor1-last=Gottlieb|editor1-first=Roger S.|title=Jainism and Ecology|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-974762-7|pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of the ecological crisis, Jains are “quite self-conscious of the ecological implications of their core teachings.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Key Chapple|first1=Christopher|editor1-last=Gottlieb|editor1-first=Roger S.|title=Jainism and Ecology|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-974762-7|pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jain teachings center on five vows that lead to reverse the flow of  or release karma. One of these vows is [[ahimsa]] or non-violence. Ahimsa “is said to contain the key to advancement along the spiritual path (sreni). This requires abstaining from harm to any being that possesses more than one sense”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Key Chapple|first1=Christopher|editor1-last=Gottlieb|editor1-first=Roger S.|title=Jainism and Ecology|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-974762-7|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principles of the Jaina tradition are rooted in environmental practices. The Jaina connection to nature is conducive to ecospirituality.

=== Ecospirituality and Islam ===

Some scholars argue that while looking at the scriptural sources of [[Islam]], you can see it is an ecologically orientated religion.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;[[Richard Foltz]], "Islam." in Roger S. Gottlieb, ed., ''The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Ecology''. Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Looking at textual sources of Islam, the [[shari'a]] preach a number of environmentally focused guidelines to push environmentalism, in particular, "maintenance of preserves, distribution of water, and the development of virgin lands."&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Much of Muslim environmentalism is a result of the [[Quran|Qur'anic]] stress of stewardship which is explained through the Arabic concept ''[[Caliphate|khilafa]]''.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; A quote translated from the ''[[hadith]]'' states, "verily, this world is sweet and appealing, and Allah placed you as vice-regents thereinl he will see what you do."&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Within the Islamic faith, there is a set importance to following the messages set forth in scripture, therefore the environmentalism spoken through them has led to a spirituality around the environment. This spirituality can also be seen with Qur'anic concept of ''[[tawhid]]'', which translates to unity.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Many Muslim environmentalists see this meaning spiritually as "all-inclusive" when in relation to the Earth.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

A majority of Muslim writers draw attention to the environmental crisis as a direct result of social injustice.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;  Many argue that the problem is not that, "humans as a species are destroying the balance of nation, but rather that ''some'' humans are taking more than their share."&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Muslim environmentalists such as [[Fazlun Khalid]], [[Yasin Dutton]], Omar Vadillo, and Hashim Dockrat have drawn a correlation between the capitalist nature of the global economy to being un-Islamic and essentiality leading to ecological crisis.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

The issues of environmental degradation are especially important to Muslims as majority of Muslims live in developing countries where they see the effects of the ecological crisis on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; This has led to conferences discussing Islam and the environment to take place in [[Iran]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] as well as the introduction of environmental nongovernmental organizations.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

=== Ecospirituality and Buddhism ===
[[Buddhism]] has been around for hundreds of years, however with the modern knowledge on topics such as [[global warming]], many Buddhist scholars have looked back at how Buddhist teaching would respond to the environmental crisis and created what is called Green Buddhism.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Gottlieb, Roger S., ed. The Oxford handbook of religion and ecology. "The Greening of Buddhism." Stephanie Kaza. Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the key players in this introduction was [[Gary Snyder]] who brought to light where Buddhist practice and ecological thinking intertwine.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Green Buddhism made waves in the 1980s when they publicly address the ecological crisis to create awareness and in 1989 when the [[Dalai Lama]] won a [[Nobel Peace Prize|Noble Peace Prize]] for the proposed introduction of [[Tibet]] as an ecological reserve.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Buddhism has been open to working with other world religions to combat the environment crisis seen at an international conference for Buddhist-Christian studies that addressed the environment.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Although Green Buddhism has not commented much on technical issues such as air and water pollution, they use their spirituality to focus heavily on "rich resources for immediate application in [[Ethical eating|food ethics]], [[animal rights]], and [[consumerism]]."&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

'''Ethnic violence'''  refers to [[violence]] expressly motivated by [[ethnic hatred]] and [[ethnic conflict]].  It is commonly related to [[political violence]], and often the terms are interchangeable, or one is used as a pretext for the other when politically expedient.
Forms of ethnic violence which can be argued to have the character of [[terrorism]] may be known as '''ethnic terrorism''' or '''ethnically-motivated terrorism'''.{{clarify|date=August 2013}} 
"Racist terrorism" is a form of ethnic violence dominated by overt [[racism]] and [[xenophobic]] reactionism.{{clarify|date=August 2013}}

Ethnic violence in an organized, sustained form is known as [[ethnic conflict]] or warfare ([[race war]]), in contrast to [[class conflict]], where the dividing line is social class rather than ethnic background.

Care must be taken to distinguish ethnic violence, which is violence ''motivated'' by an ethnic division, from violence that just happens to break out between groups of different ethnicity motivated by other factors (political or ideological).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Michael E., and John Rex. The Ethnicity Reader: Nationalism, Multiculturalism, and Migration. Cambridge, UK: Polity, 1997. 80-100. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Violent ethnic rivalry is the subject matter of Jewish sociologist [[Ludwig Gumplowicz]]'s ''Der Rassenkampf'' ("Struggle of the Races", 1909); and more recently of [[Amy Chua]]'s notable study, ''[[World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability|World On Fire]]: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability''.
Some academics would place all "nationalist-based violence" under ethnic violence, which would include the World Wars and all major conflicts between industrialised nations during the 19th century.{{dubious|date=August 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;Muller, Jerry Z. "Us and Them." Foreign Affairs. Council on Foreign Relations, Mar.-Apr. 2008. Web. &lt;http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/63217/jerry-z-muller/us-and-them&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causality and characteristics==
{{essay-like|date=August 2013}}
There are a variety of potential causes for ethnic violence. Research by the New England Complex Systems Institute (NESCI) has shown that violence results when ethnic groups are partially mixed: neither clearly separated enough to reduce contact nor thoroughly mixed enough to build common bonds.  According to Dr. May Lim, a researcher affiliated with NECSI, "Violence normally occurs when a group is large enough to impose cultural norms on public spaces, but not large enough to prevent those norms from being broken. Usually this occurs in places where boundaries between ethnic or cultural groups are unclear." &lt;ref&gt;M. Lim, R. Metzler, Y. Bar-Yam, Global Pattern Formation and Ethnic/Cultural Violence, Science 317, 5844 (2007).http://www.necsi.edu/research/ethnicviolence/sci317/&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory also states that the minimum requirement for ethnic tensions to result in ethnic violence on a systemic level is a heterogeneous society and the lack of a power to prevent them from fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Michael E., and John Rex. The Ethnicity Reader: Nationalism, Multiculturalism, and Migration. Cambridge, UK: Polity, 1997. 80-100. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ethnic conflicts that erupted after the end of the Cold War, this lack of outer controls is seen as the cause; Since there was no longer a strong centralized power (in the form of the USSR) to control the various ethnic groups, they then had to provide defense for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Michael E., and John Rex. The Ethnicity Reader: Nationalism, Multiculturalism, and Migration. Cambridge, UK: Polity, 1997. 80-100. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that once ethnicity is established, there needs to be strong distinctions, otherwise violence is inevitable.

Another theory supports that a general feeling of lack of security can cause ethnic violence, when paired with proximity to other ethnic groups. This can eventually lead to distrust of the other ethnic groups, which leads to an unwillingness to peacefully coexist with the other ethnic groups.

The emotions that tend to cause ethnic tensions, which can lead to ethnic violence, are fear, hate, resentment, and rage. Individual identities might change throughout the years, but strong emotional issues can lead to a desire to fulfill those needs above all other concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, Roger Dale. Understanding Ethnic Violence: Fear, Hatred, and Resentment in Twentieth-century Eastern Europe. Cambridge [England: Cambridge UP, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This strong desire to satisfy individual needs, without harming your own group, can have violent results.

Assuming that ethnic groups can be defined as a group of people who band together to protect material goods, while satisfying the need to feel a part of a group, violence resulting from ethnicity can be a result of a violation of either of these. However, this also requires that there was no peaceful solution.&lt;ref&gt;Fearon, James D., and David D. Laitin. "Explaining Interethnic Cooperation." The American Political Science Review 90.4 (1996): 715-35. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory states that ethnic violence is the result of past tensions. Referring to the other ethnic group based solely on their previous offences tends to increase the probability of future violence.&lt;ref&gt;Fearon, James D., and David D. Laitin. "Explaining Interethnic Cooperation." The American Political Science Review 90.4 (1996): 715-35. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This is referenced in the literature on ethnic violence that tends to focus on areas that have already had a history of ethnic violence, instead of comparing them with areas that have had peaceful ethnic relations.&lt;ref&gt;Habyrimana, James, Macartan Humphreys, Daniel Posner, Jeremy Weinstein, Richard Rosecrance, Arthur Stein, and Jerry Z. Muller. "Is Ethnic Conflict Inevitable?" Council on Foreign Relations (July 2008). Web. &lt;http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/64457/james-habyarimana-macartan-humphreys-daniel-posner-jeremy-weinst/is-ethnic-conflict-inevitable#&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic violence obviously does not exist in exactly the same conditions in every example. Where one case of ethnic violence might result in a drawn out genocide, another might result in a race riot. Different issues lead to different levels of intensity of violence. The problem mainly comes down to issues of group security. In situations where offensive and defensive actions are indistinguishable to outsiders, and the offensive actions are more effective in insuring group survival, then violence is sure to be present and harsh.&lt;ref&gt;Posen, Barry R. "The Security Problem and Ethnic Conflict." (1993). Johns Hopkins University. Web. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sais-jhu.edu/cmtoolkit/pdfs/posen-1993.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227042314/http://www.sais-jhu.edu/cmtoolkit/pdfs/posen-1993.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-27 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This view of ethnic violence placed risk in areas where members of ethnic groups feel insecure about their future, not as a result of emotional tensions.

Ethnic violence often occurs as a result of individual domestic disputes spiralling out of control to large-scale conflicts. When individual disputes occur between two members of different ethnic groups, they can either result in peace or result in further violence. Peace is more likely when the offended person feels their offender will be punished sufficiently in their own ethnic group. Or peace is achieved simply through the fear of greater ethnic violence. If either the belief of retribution or the fear of violence is not present, then ethnic violence may occur.&lt;ref&gt;Fearon, James D., and David D. Laitin. "Explaining Interethnic Cooperation." The American Political Science Review 90.4 (1996): 715-35. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic violence being particularly violent, there are numerous theories for preventing it, or once it starts, for ending it. Yaneer Bar-Yam of the New England Complex Systems Institute suggests that either "clear boundaries" or "thorough mixing" can reduce violence, citing Switzerland as an example.{{clarify|date=August 2013}}

Unfortunately, poorly planned separations do not lead to peace among ethnic groups.  Religious separation between India and Pakistan left large heterogenous areas in India where violence has since occurred.&lt;ref&gt;"Scientists Who Model Ethnic Violence Find That in Switzerland, Separation Is Key to Peace." Discover Blogs. Discover Magazine, 12 Oct. 2011. Web. &lt;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2011/10/12/scientists-who-model-ethnic-violence-find-that-in-switzerland-separation-is-key-to-peace/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] is often presented as the classic "melting pot" of ethnicities. "Ethnic" tensions in the United States are more typically viewed in terms of [[race in the United States|race]].

Using the media to change perceptions of ethnicity might lead to a change in probability of ethnic violence. The use of media that results in ethnic violence is usually a cyclical relationship; one group increases messages of group cohesion in response to a perceived threat, and a neighboring group responds with messages of their own group cohesion. Of course, this only happens when outside groups are already perceived as being potential threats.&lt;ref&gt;Posen, Barry R. "The Security Problem and Ethnic Conflict." (1993). Johns Hopkins University. Web. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sais-jhu.edu/cmtoolkit/pdfs/posen-1993.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227042314/http://www.sais-jhu.edu/cmtoolkit/pdfs/posen-1993.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-27 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Using this logic, ethnic violence might be prevented by decreasing messages of group cohesion, while increasing messages of safety and solidarity with members of other ethnic groups.

Outside forces may also be effective in decreasing the likelihood of ethnic violence. However, not all interferences from outside forces may be helpful. If not handled delicately, the possibility might increase. Outside groups can help stabilize danger zones by imposing gentle economic sanctions, develop more representative political institutions that would allow for minority voices to be heard, and encourage the respect of ethnically diverse communities and minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Michael E., and John Rex. The Ethnicity Reader: Nationalism, Multiculturalism, and Migration. Cambridge, UK: Polity, 1997. 80-100. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, if done incorrectly, outside interference can cause a nationalistic lash-back.

The [[Guatemalan Civil War]] was fought along ideological lines (leftist rebel groups) but acquired ethnic characteristics because the rebels were primarily supported by the indigenous Mayan groups.

Terrorism against [[Copts]] in Egypt qualifies as both ethnic and religious and isn't fought in an ongoing conflict but reflects a history of sporadic and continuous attacks, over the years.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Abdelhadi|first=Magdi|title=Egyptians take Tahrir Square to the junta's doorstep |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/03/egyptians-tahrir-square-junta-abbassia|work=The Guardian|accessdate=7 December 2012|location=London|date=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="list of attacks"&gt;{{cite web|title=List of attacks on Christians churches, institutions and individuals in Egypt|url=http://www.bishopangaelos.org/content/list-attacks-christians-churches-institutions-and-individuals-egypt|website=Bishop Angaelos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="women and children killed"&gt;{{cite news|title=Blast hits near Christian cathedral in Cairo, 25 killed, 49 wounded|url=https://www.rt.com/news/369924-cairo-coptic-blast-cathedral/|accessdate=12 December 2016|agency=RT|date=December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MB-war"&gt;{{cite web|last=Powers|first=Kirsten|title=The Muslim Brotherhood's War on Coptic Christians|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/08/22/the-muslim-brotherhood-s-war-on-coptic-christians.html|date=Aug 22, 2013|work=Daily Beast|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Execution of Czolgosz with Panorama of Auburn Prison''''' is a 1901 [[silent film]] produced by the [[Edison Studios]] arms of [[Edison Manufacturing Company]]. The film is a [[Historical reenactment|dramatic reenactment]] of the execution of [[Leon Czolgosz]] by [[electric chair]] at [[Auburn Correctional Facility]] following his 1901 conviction for the [[assassination of William McKinley]]. It is considered an important film in the history of cinema.&lt;ref name="Auerbach"&gt;Auerbach, Jonathan (2007). ''Body Shots: Early Cinema's Incarnations.'' University of California Press, {{ISBN|9780520252936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production and influence==

Throughout 1901, Edison had produced and released numerous films about the assassination, due to intense public interest. For the final film in the series, producer [[Edwin S. Porter]] sought permission to film the execution itself but was denied. Instead, they filmed outside the prison the day of the execution, then recreated the execution on a set.

The film comprises four shots. Two of them are actual footage of the outside of Auburn Prison on the day of the execution. The other two are recreations of the execution with actors, cut together in an early example of [[continuity editing]].&lt;ref name="Fairservice"&gt;Fairservice, Don (2002). ''Film Editing: History, Theory and Practice: Looking at the Invisible.'' Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|9780719057779}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doane"&gt;Doane, Mary Ann (2002). ''The Emergence of Cinematic Time: Modernity, Contingency, the Archive.'' [[Harvard University Press]], {{ISBN|9780674007291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Edison Studios catalog of the time, the film is: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;A detailed reproduction of the execution of the assassin of President McKinley faithfully carried out from the description of an eye witness. The picture is in three scenes. First: Panoramic view of Auburn Prison taken the morning of the electrocution. The picture then dissolves into the corridor of murderer's row. The keepers are seen taking Czolgosz from his cell to the death chamber, and shows State Electrician, Wardens and Doctors making final test of the chair. Czolgosz is then brought in by the guard and is quickly strapped into the chair. The current is turned on at a signal from the Warden, and the assassin heaves heavily as though the straps would break. He drops prone after the current is turned off. The doctors examine the body and report to the Warden that he is dead, and he in turn officially announces the death to the witness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because [[copyright]] did not cover films until The Townsend Amendment of 1912 updated the [[Copyright Act of 1909]], Edison Manufacturing Company submitted a paper copy to the Paper Print Collection of the [[Library of Congress]], now part of the collection in the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division.

Film historian Don Fairservice has noted the parallels with the 1901 film ''[[Histoire d'un crime (film)|Histoire d'un crime]]'' by [[Ferdinand Zecca]].&lt;ref name="Fairservice"/&gt;

'''Ghazi Nasr Al-Din''' is a [[Lebanese Venezuelan]] who served as Charge d' Affaires of the Venezuelan Embassy in Damascus, Syria and is accused of assisting [[Hezbollah]].

==Early life==
Ghazi Nasr Al-Din was born on 13 December 1962 in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="FBIghazi"&gt;{{cite web|title=GHAZI NASR AL-DIN|url=https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/terrorinfo/ghazi-nasr-al-din|website=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]|accessdate=8 February 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 2000, shortly after [[Hugo Chávez]] came to power, Nasr Al-Din immigrated into Venezuela.&lt;ref name="USforeign"&gt;{{cite web|title=IRAN’S INFLUENCE AND ACTIVITY IN LATIN AMERICA|url=http://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Roger_Noriega_Testimony1.pdf|publisher=[[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]]|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasr Al-Din eventually established a relationship with aspiring Venezuelan politician [[Tareck El Aissami]].&lt;ref name="USforeign"/&gt; He was then made the Charge d' Affaires of the Venezuelan Embassy in Damascus, Syria.&lt;ref name="USforeign"/&gt; In 2008, he was appointed as Director of Political Aspects at the Venezuelan Embassy in Lebanon.&lt;ref name="Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Treasury Targets Hizballah in Venezuela|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/pages/hp1036.aspx|work=Press Release|publisher=United State Department of Treasury|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
===Hezbollah allegations===
While serving as a Venezuelan diplomat in Venezuela and making connections through a local Islamic group in Venezuela, Nasr Al-Din allegedly established ties to various entities in the Middle East, including the terrorist organization [[Hezbollah]].&lt;ref name="Press Release"/&gt; The Government of the United States has accused Nasr Al-Din of having "counseled Hizballah donors on fundraising efforts and has provided donors with specific information on bank accounts where the donors' deposits would go directly to Hizballah" and had "met with senior Hizballah officials in Lebanon to discuss operational issues, as well as facilitated the travel of Hizballah members to and from Venezuela".&lt;ref name="Press Release"/&gt; Allegations also involved an event in January 2006, where "Nasr al Din facilitated the travel of two Hizballah representatives to the Lebanese Parliament to Caracas to solicit donations for Hizballah and to announce the opening of a Hizballah-sponsored community center and office in Venezuela", later assisting the travel of more Hezbollah members to Iran.&lt;ref name="Press Release"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNpassport"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zamost|first1=Scott|last2=Guerrero|first2=Kay|last3=Griffin|first3=Drew|last4=Romo|first4=Rafael|last5=del Rincón|first5=Fernando|title=Pasaportes venezolanos, ¿en manos equivocadas?|url=http://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2017/02/06/pasaportes-venezolanos-en-manos-equivocadas/|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=[[CNN Español]]|date=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasr Al-Din had also met with Walid Makled, a Venezuelan drug trafficker, doing "business" with him.&lt;ref name="HOUSEgpo"&gt;{{cite web|title=HEZBOLLAH IN LATIN AMERICA--IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-112hhrg72255/html/CHRG-112hhrg72255.htm|website=www.gpo.gov|publisher=[[United States House Committee on Homeland Security]]|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2006 appointment of [[Nicolás Maduro]], Venezuela's future president, to be Venezuela's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nasr Al-Din's diplomatic workload increased as he delivered multiple Venezuelan visas to Lebanese citizens in 2007.&lt;ref name="ABCjan2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blasco|first1=Emili J.|title=El FBI investiga la conexión entre Hizbolá y el narcoestado venezolano|url=http://www.abc.es/internacional/20150131/abci-narcoestado-venezuela-hizbola-201501301916.html|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|date=31 January 2015|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] placed Nasr Al-Din on its terrorism blacklist citing his assistance of Hezbollah.&lt;ref name="Press Release"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABCjan2015"/&gt;

A 22 August 2010 meeting in Caracas was also planned by Nasr Al-Din, which involved Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, [[Hamas]] Supreme Leader [[Khaled Meshal]], a Hezbollah leader and Secretary-General of the [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine]] [[Ramadan Abdullah Mohammad Shallah]].&lt;ref name="HOUSEgpo"/&gt; In 2015, the FBI listed him as a person of interest due to his connections to Hezbollah.&lt;ref name="ABCjan2015"/&gt;

====Family involvement====
Nasr Al-Din brothers, Abdallah and Oday, both reside in [[Isla Margarita]], Venezuela.&lt;ref name="USforeign"/&gt; Abdallah Nasr Al-Din allegedly launders money for Hezbollah on the island while Oday recruits [[Chavismo|chavistas]] to join [[Bolivarian Circles]] and travel to Iran for training.&lt;ref name="USforeign"/&gt;

====Response====
In an interview with the Russian state television network [[RT (TV network)|RT]], Nasr Al-Din explained his opposition to the United States, stating that the accusations of his involvement with Hezbollah are due to his anti-American sentiments and his role between Syria and Venezuela. He also boast of Iran's "popular support" and "military potential" against the United States and voiced his support of [[Russian military intervention in Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exdiplomático buscado por el FBI: "EE.UU. compra a un amigo y vende a un aliado de un día para otro"|url=https://actualidad.rt.com/programas/entrevista/190296-entrevista-ghazi-atef-nassereddine-exdiplomatico|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=[[RT (TV network)|RT]]|date=2 November 2015|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19630">'''Intersubjectivity''', in [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[anthropology]], is the psychological relation between people. It is usually used in contrast to [[Solipsism|solipsistic]] individual experience, emphasizing our inherently social being.

==Definition==

"Intersubjectivity" is a term coined by social scientists as a short-hand description for a variety of human interactions. For example, social psychologists Alex Gillespie and Flora Cornish list at least six definitions of intersubjectivity (and other disciplines have additional definitions).&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, A. &amp; Cornish, F. (2010). [http://users.utu.fi/freder/gillespie.pdf]. Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour, 40, 19-46&lt;/ref&gt;

"Intersubjectivity" has been used in social science to refer to agreement. There is "intersubjectivity" between people if they agree on a given set of meanings or a definition of the situation. Similarly, Thomas Scheff defines "intersubjectivity" as "the sharing of subjective states by two or more individuals."&lt;ref&gt;Scheff, Thomas et al. (2006). ''Goffman Unbound!: A New Paradigm for Social Science (The Sociological Imagination)'', Paradigm Publishers ({{ISBN|978-1-59451-196-7}})&lt;/ref&gt;

"Intersubjectivity" also has been used to refer to the [[common sense|common-sense]], shared meanings constructed by people in their interactions with each other and used as an everyday resource to interpret the meaning of elements of social and cultural life. If people share common sense, then they share a definition of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clive Seale]]. [http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~hsstcfs/glossary.htm Glossary],  ''Researching Society and Culture''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been used to refer to shared (or partially shared) ''divergences'' of meaning. Self-presentation, lying, practical jokes, and social emotions, for example, all [[logical consequence|entail]] not a shared definition of the situation but partially shared divergences of meaning. Someone who is telling a lie is engaged in an intersubjective act because they are working with two different definitions of the situation. Lying is thus genuinely ''inter''subjective (in the sense of operating between two subjective definitions of reality).{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

"Intersubjectivity" can also be understood as the process of so-called psychological energy moving between two or more subjects. In a room where someone is lying on their deathbed, for example, the room can appear enveloped in a shroud of gloom for people interacting with the dying person. The psychological weight of one subject comes to bear on the minds of others depending on how they react to it, thereby creating an intersubjective experience that, without multiple consciousnesses interacting with each other, would be otherwise strictly solitary. [[Love]] is a prime example of intersubjectivity that implies a shared feeling of care and affection, among others.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Among the early authors who explored this conception in psychoanalysis, in an explicit or implicit way, were [[Heinz Kohut]], [[Robert Stolorow]], [[George E. Atwood]], [[Jessica Benjamin]] in the United States, and [[:it:Silvia Montefoschi|Silvia Montefoschi]] in Italy.

Psychoanalyst Jessica Benjamin, in ''The Bonds of Love'', writes, "The concept of intersubjectivity has its origins in the social theory of [[Jürgen Habermas]] (1970), who used the expression 'the intersubjectivity of mutual understanding' to designate an individual capacity and a social domain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benjamin|first=Jessica|title=The Bonds of Love: Psychoanalysis, Feminism, &amp; the Problem of Domination|date=July 12, 1988|publisher=Pantheon|isbn=0394757300|pages=320|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Bonds-Love-Psychoanalysis-Domination/dp/0394757300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Contemporarily, intersubjectivity is a major topic in both the [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and the [[Continental philosophy|continental]] traditions of philosophy. Intersubjectivity is considered crucial not only at the relational level but also at the epistemological and even metaphysical levels. For example, intersubjectivity is postulated as playing a role in establishing the truth of propositions, and constituting the so-called objectivity of objects.

A central concern in consciousness studies of the past 50 years is the so-called problem of ''other minds,'' which asks how we can justify our belief that people have minds much like our own and predict others' mind-states and behavior, as our experience shows we often can.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, A (2010). "Other Minds", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall Edition), Edward N. Zalta (Ed.) Accessed from plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/other-minds/&gt;. Section 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary philosophical theories of intersubjectivity need to address the problem of other minds.

In the debate between cognitive individualism and cognitive universalism, some aspects of thinking are neither solely personal nor fully universal. Cognitive sociology proponents argue for ''intersubjectivity''—an intermediate perspective of social cognition that provides a balanced view between personal and universal views of our social cognition. This approach suggests that, instead of being individual or universal thinkers, human beings subscribe to "thought communities"—communities of differing beliefs. Thought community examples include churches, professions, scientific beliefs, generations, nations, and political movements.&lt;ref name="Zerubavel 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zerubavel|first=Eviatar|title=Social Mindscapes: An Invitation to Cognitive Sociology|year=1997|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective explains why each individual thinks differently from each another (individualism): person A may choose to adhere to expiry dates on foods, but person B may believe that expiry dates are only guidelines and it is still safe to eat the food days past the expiry date. But not all human beings think the same way (universalism).

Intersubjectivity argues that each thought community shares social experiences that are different from the social experiences of other thought communities, creating differing beliefs among people who subscribe to different thought communities. These experiences transcend our subjectivity, which explains why they can be shared by the entire thought community.&lt;ref name="Zerubavel 1997"/&gt; Proponents of intersubjectivity support the view that individual beliefs are often the result of thought community beliefs, not just personal experiences or universal and objective human beliefs. Beliefs are recast in terms of standards, which are set by thought communities.

===Phenomenology===
[[Edmund Husserl]], the founder of [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], recognized the importance of intersubjectivity, and wrote extensively on the topic. In German, his writings on intersubjectivity are gathered in volumes 13–15 of the ''[[Husserliana]]''. In English, his best-known text on intersubjectivity is the ''[[Cartesian Meditations]]'' (it is this text that features solely in the Husserl reader entitled ''The Essential Husserl''). Although Husserlian phenomenology is often charged with methodological [[solipsism]], in the fifth Cartesian Meditation, Husserl attempts to grapple with the problem of intersubjectivity and puts forward his theory of transcendental, monadological intersubjectivity.&lt;ref&gt;E. Husserl, ''Cartesian Meditations'', Klumer Academic Publishers. Translated by Dorion Cairns.&lt;/ref&gt;

Husserl's student [[Edith Stein]] extended intersubjectivity's basis in empathy in her 1917 doctoral dissertation, ''On the Problem of Empathy'' (''Zum Problem der Einfühlung'').

Intersubjectivity also helps to constitute objectivity: in the experience of the world as available not only to oneself, but also to the Other, there is a bridge between the personal and the shared, the self and the Others.

==Psychology==
Discussions and theories of intersubjectivity are prominent and of importance in contemporary psychology, theory of mind, and consciousness studies. Three major contemporary theories of intersubjectivity are theory theory, simulation theory, and interaction theory.

Shannon Spaulding, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at [[Oklahoma State University]], writes; "Theory theorists argue that we explain and predict behaviour by employing folk psychological theories about how mental states inform behaviour. With our folk psychological theories, we infer from a target's behaviour what his or her mental states probably are. And from these inferences, plus the psychological principles in the theory connecting mental states to behavior, we predict the target's behaviour (Carruthers and Smith 1996; Davies and Stone 1995a; Gopnik and Wellman 1992; Nichols and Stich 2003)."&lt;ref name="Spaulding"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Introduction to debates on Social Cognition |journal=[[Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences]] |date=2012-09-05 |last=Spaulding |first=Shannon |volume=11 |issue=4 |page=432 |issn=1568-7759 |doi=10.1007/s11097-012-9275-x }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2015-11-23 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Simulation theorists, on the other hand, claim that we explain and predict others' behaviour by using our own minds as a model and "putting ourselves in another's shoes"—that is, by imagining what our mental states would be and how we would behave if we were in the other's situation. More specifically, we simulate what the other's mental states could have been to cause the observed behaviour, then use the simulated mental states, pretend beliefs, and pretend desires as input, running them through our own decision-making mechanism. We then take the resulting conclusion and attribute it to the other person.&lt;ref&gt;Spaulding, S. (2012) “Introduction to debates on Social Cognition.” Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences. Vol. 11. Pg. 433&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, authors like [[Vittorio Gallese]] have proposed a theory of embodied simulation that refers to neuroscientific research on mirror neurons and phenomenological research.&lt;ref&gt;Gallese, V &amp; Sinigaglia, C. (2011) What is so special about embodied simulation. Trends in Cognitive Sciences. Vol. 15, No. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spaulding notes that this debate has stalled in the past few years, with progress limited to articulating various hybrid simulation theories—"theory theory" accounts.&lt;ref name="Spaulding"/&gt; To resolve this impasse, authors like [[Shaun Gallagher]] put forward interaction theory. Gallagher writes that an "...important shift is taking place in social cognition research, away from a focus on the individual mind and toward... participatory aspects of social understanding...." Interaction theory is put forward to "galvanize" the interactive turn in explanations of intersubjectivity.&lt;ref&gt;De Jaeger, H., Di Paulo, E., &amp; Gallagher, S.  (2010) Can social interaction constitute social cognition? Trends in Cognitive Sciences. Vol. 14, No. 10. Pg 441. DOI:[http://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2010.06.009 10.1016/j.tics.2010.06.009]&lt;/ref&gt; Gallagher defines an interaction as two or more autonomous agents engaged in co-regulated coupling behavior. For example, when walking a dog, both the owner's behavior is regulated by the dog stopping and sniffing, and the dog's behavior is regulated by the lead and the owner's commands. Ergo, walking the dog is an example of an interactive process. For Gallagher, interaction and direct perception constitute what he terms "primary" (or basic) intersubjectivity.

Studies of dialogue and [[dialogism]] reveal how language is deeply intersubjective. When we speak, we always address our interlocutors, taking their perspective and orienting to what we think they think (or, more often, don't think).&lt;ref&gt;Linell, P. (2009). Rethinking language, mind and world dialogically. Charlotte, NC: Information Age Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; Within this tradition of research, it has been argued that the structure of individual signs or symbols, the basis of language, is intersubjective&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, A. (2009). [https://lse.academia.edu/AlexGillespie/Papers/1347714/The_intersubjective_nature_of_symbols The intersubjective nature of symbols]. In Brady Wagoner (Ed), Symbolic transformations. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; and that the psychological process of self-reflection entails intersubjectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, A. (2007). [https://lse.academia.edu/AlexGillespie/Papers/1347645/The_social_basis_of_self-reflection The social basis of self-reflection]. In Valsiner and Rosa (Eds), The Cambridge handbook of sociocultural psychology. Cambridge: Cambridge University press&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research on [[mirror neurons]] provides evidence for the deeply intersubjective basis of human psychology,&lt;ref&gt;Rizzolatti, G. &amp; Arbib, M. A. (1998). [http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:2376676/component/escidoc:2376675/Rizzolatti_1998_Language.pdf Language within our grasp]. Trends in neurosciences, 21, 188-194.&lt;/ref&gt; and arguably much of the literature on [[empathy]] and [[theory of mind]] relates directly to intersubjectivity.

==In child development==
[[Colwyn Trevarthen]] has applied intersubjectivity to the very rapid cultural development of new born infants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psych.uw.edu.pl/lasc/Trevarthen2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that as babies, humans are biologically wired to “coordinate their actions with others.”&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stone|first1=Lynda|last2=Underwood|first2=Charles|last3=Hotchkiss|first3=Jacqueline|title=The Relational Habitus: Intersubjective Processes in Learning Settings|url=http://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/337150|accessdate=10 December 2014|ref=Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ability to coordinate and sync with others facilitates cognitive and emotional learning through social interaction. Additionally, the most socially productive relationship between children and adults is bidirectional, where both parties actively define a shared culture.&lt;ref name=Stone /&gt; The bidirectional aspect lets the active parties organize the relationship how they see fit—what they see as important receives the most focus. Emphasis is placed on the idea that children are actively involved in how they learn, using intersubjectivity.&lt;ref name=Stone /&gt;

===Across cultures===
The ways intersubjectivity occurs varies across cultures. In certain Indigenous American communities, [[nonverbal communication]] is so prevalent that intersubjectivity may occur regularly amongst all members of the community, in part perhaps due to a "joint cultural understanding" and a history of shared endeavors.&lt;ref name="Correa-Chavez"&gt;Correa-Chávez, M., &amp; Roberts, A. (2012). A cultural analysis is necessary in understanding intersubjectivity. Culture &amp; Psychology, 18(1), 99-108. doi: 10.1177/1354067X11427471&lt;/ref&gt; This "joint cultural understanding" may develop in small, Indigenous American communities where children have grown up embedded in their community's values, expectations, and livelihoods—learning through participation with adults rather than through intent verbal instruction—working in cohesion with one another in shared endeavors on a daily basis. Having grown up within this context may have led to members of this community to have what is described by some as a "blending of agendas,"&lt;ref name="Correa-Chavez" /&gt; or by others as a "dovetailing of motives."&lt;ref&gt;Danziger, E., &amp; Rumsey, A. (2013). Introduction: From Opacity to intersubjectivity across languages and cultures. Language &amp; Communication, 33(3), 247-250.&lt;/ref&gt; If community or family members have the same general goals in mind they may thus act cohesively within an overlapping state of mind. Whether persons are in each other's presence or merely within the same community this blending of agendas or dovetailing of motives enables intersubjectivity to occur within these shared endeavors.&lt;ref name="Correa-Chavez" /&gt;

The cultural value of ''respeto'' may also contribute to intersubjectivity in some communities; unlike the English definition of 'respect,' ''respeto'' refers loosely to a mutual consideration for others' activities, needs, wants, etc.&lt;ref name="Correa-Chavez" /&gt; Similar to "putting yourself in one's shoes" the prevalence of ''respeto'' in certain Indigenous American communities in Mexico and South America may promote intersubjectivity as persons act in accordance with one another within consideration for the community or the individual's current needs or state of mind.

Shared reference during an activity facilitates learning. Adults either teach by doing the task with children, or by directing attention toward experts. Children that had to ask questions in regard to how to perform a task were scolded for not learning by another's example, as though they were ignoring the available resources to learn a task, as seen in [[Tz'utujil people|Tz’utujil Maya]] parents who scolded questioning children and asking "if they had eyes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paradise|first1=Ruth|last2=Rogoff|first2=Barbara|title=Side by Side: Learning by Observing and Pitching In|journal=Ethos|date=2009|volume=37|issue=1|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1352.2009.01033.x|ref=ParadiseRuth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children from the [[Ch'illiwani|Chillihuani]] village in the Andean mountains learned to [[Weaving|weave]] without explicit instruction. They learned the basic technique from others by observing, eager to participate in their community. The learning process was facilitated by watching adults and by being allowed to play and experiment using tools to create their own weaving techniques.&lt;ref name=Bolin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bolin|first1=Inge|title=Growing Up in a Culture of Respect: Childrearing in highland Peru|date=2006|publisher=University of Texas|location=Austin|isbn=978-0-292-71298-0|pages=90–99|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13912">'''Ion semiconductor sequencing''' is a method of [[DNA sequencing]] based on the detection of [[hydrogen ion]]s that are released during the [[DNA polymerase|polymerization]] of [[DNA]]. This is a method of "sequencing by synthesis", during which a [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] strand is built based on the sequence of a template strand.

[[File:Life Technologies - Ion Proton (TM).jpg|thumb|A Ion Proton semiconductor sequencer]]

A microwell containing a template DNA strand to be sequenced is flooded with a single species of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP). If the introduced dNTP is [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the leading template nucleotide, it is incorporated into the growing complementary strand. This causes the release of a hydrogen ion that triggers an [[ISFET]] ion sensor, which indicates that a reaction has occurred. If homopolymer repeats are present in the template sequence, multiple dNTP molecules will be incorporated in a single cycle. This leads to a corresponding number of released hydrogens and a proportionally higher electronic signal.

This technology differs from other [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] technologies in that no modified nucleotides or [[optics]] are used. Ion semiconductor sequencing may also be referred to as Ion Torrent sequencing, pH-mediated sequencing, silicon sequencing, or semiconductor sequencing.

=== Sequencing chemistry ===

In nature, the incorporation of a [[Deoxyribonucleotide|deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate]] (dNTP) into a growing DNA strand involves the formation of a [[covalent bond]] and the release of [[pyrophosphate]] and a positively charged [[hydrogen ion]].&lt;ref name="davies1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rusk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="toumazou"&gt;Purushothaman, S, Toumazou, C, Ou, C-P [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400505007409 Protons and single nucleotide polymorphism detection: a simple use for the ion sensitive field effect transistor]&lt;/ref&gt; A dNTP will only be incorporated if it is [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the leading unpaired template nucleotide. Ion semiconductor sequencing exploits these facts by determining if a hydrogen ion is released upon providing a single species of dNTP to the reaction.

Microwells on a [[semiconductor chip]] that each contain many copies of one single-stranded template DNA molecule to be sequenced and [[DNA polymerase]] are sequentially flooded with unmodified [[nucleic acid notation|A, C, G or T]] dNTP.&lt;ref name="rusk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pennisi"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pennisi | first1 = E | year = 2010 | title = Semiconductors inspire new sequencing technologies | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/327/5970/1190.short | journal = Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5970| page = 1190 | doi=10.1126/science.327.5970.1190 | pmid=20203024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perkel"&gt;Perkel, J., [http://www.biotechniques.com/BiotechniquesJournal/2011/February/Making-Contact-with-Sequencings-Fourth-Generation/biotechniques-308942.html?service=print "Making contact with sequencing's fourth generation"]. Biotechniques, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; If an introduced dNTP is complementary to the next unpaired nucleotide on the template strand it is incorporated into the growing complementary strand by the DNA polymerase.&lt;ref name="alberts"&gt;Alberts B, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21054/ Molecular Biology of the Cell]. 5th Edition ed. 2008, New York: Garland Science.&lt;/ref&gt; If the introduced dNTP is not complementary there is no incorporation and no biochemical reaction. The hydrogen ion that is released in the reaction changes the [[pH]] of the solution, which is detected by an [[ISFET]].&lt;ref name="davies1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rusk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pennisi"/&gt; The unattached dNTP molecules are washed out before the next cycle when a different dNTP species is introduced.&lt;ref name="pennisi"/&gt;

=== Signal detection ===

Beneath the layer of microwells is an ion sensitive layer, below which is an [[ISFET]] ion sensor.&lt;ref name="ion torrent"/&gt; All layers are contained within a [[CMOS]] semiconductor chip, similar to that used in the electronics industry.&lt;ref name="ion torrent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="karow patent"&gt;Karow, J. (2009) [http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/targetblank Ion Torrent Patent App Suggests Sequencing Tech Using Chemical-Sensitive Field-Effect Transistors]. In Sequence.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each chip contains an array of microwells with corresponding [[ISFET]] detectors.&lt;ref name="pennisi"/&gt;
Each released hydrogen ion then triggers the [[ISFET]] ion sensor. The series of electrical pulses transmitted from the chip to a computer is translated into a DNA sequence, with no intermediate signal conversion required.&lt;ref name="pennisi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="davies"&gt;Bio-IT World, Davies, K. [http://www.bio-itworld.com/news/03/01/10/ion-torrent-semiconductor-sequencing.html It’s "Watson Meets Moore" as Ion Torrent Introduces Semiconductor Sequencing]. Bio-IT World  2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Because nucleotide incorporation events are measured directly by electronics, the use of labeled nucleotides and optical measurements are avoided.&lt;ref name="ion torrent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="karow patent"/&gt; Signal processing and DNA assembly can then be carried out in software.

=== Sequencing characteristics ===

The per base accuracy achieved in house by Ion Torrent on the [http://www.lifetechnologies.com/iontorrent Ion Torrent] Ion semiconductor sequencer as of February 2011 was 99.6% based on 50 [[base pair|base]] reads, with 100 Mb per run.&lt;ref name="karow feedback"&gt;Karow, J. (2009) [http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/agbt-ion-torrent-customers-provide-first-feedback-life-tech-outlines-platforms-g At AGBT, Ion Torrent Customers Provide First Feedback; Life Tech Outlines Platform's Growth]. In Sequence.&lt;/ref&gt; The read-length as of February 2011 was 100 [[base pairs]].&lt;ref name="karow feedback"/&gt; The accuracy for homopolymer repeats of 5 repeats in length was 98%.&lt;ref name="karow feedback"/&gt;  Later releases show a read length of 400 base pairs &lt;ref name = "Ion PGM"&gt;[https://tools.lifetechnologies.com/content/sfs/brochures/Small-Genome-Ecoli-De-Novo-App-Note.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that these figures have not yet been independently verified outside of the company.

== Strengths ==

The major benefits of ion semiconductor sequencing are rapid sequencing speed and low upfront and operating costs.&lt;ref name="perkel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="davies"/&gt; This has been enabled by the avoidance of modified nucleotides and optical measurements.

Because the system records natural polymerase-mediated nucleotide incorporation events, sequencing can occur in real-time. In reality, the sequencing rate is limited by the cycling of [[Enzyme substrate (Biology)|substrate]] nucleotides through the system.&lt;ref name="eid"&gt;Eid, J., et al., [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5910/133.short "Real-time DNA sequencing from single polymerase molecules"]. Science, 2009. 323(5910): p. 133-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Ion Torrent Systems Inc., the developer of the technology, claims that each incorporation measurement takes 4 seconds and each run takes about one hour, during which 100-200 nucleotides are sequenced.&lt;ref name="davies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="karow agbt"&gt;Karow, J. (2010) [http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/ion-torrent-systems-presents-50000-electronic-sequencer-agbt Ion Torrent Systems Presents $50,000 Electronic Sequencer at AGBT]. In Sequence.&lt;/ref&gt; If the semiconductor chips are improved (as predicted by [[Moore’s law]]), the number of reads per chip (and therefore per run) should increase.&lt;ref name="davies"/&gt;

The cost of acquiring a pH-mediated sequencer from Ion Torrent Systems Inc. at time of launch was priced at around $50,000 USD, excluding sample preparation equipment and a server for data analysis.&lt;ref name="perkel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="davies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="karow agbt"/&gt; The cost per run is also significantly lower than that of alternative automated sequencing methods, at roughly $1,000.&lt;ref name="perkel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="karow feedback"/&gt;

== Limitations ==

If [[homopolymer]] repeats of the same nucleotide (e.g. {{DNA sequence|TTTTT}}) are present on the [[template strand]] (strand to be sequenced) then multiple introduced nucleotides are incorporated and more hydrogen ions are released in a single cycle. This results in a greater pH change and a proportionally greater electronic signal.&lt;ref name="davies"/&gt; This is a limitation of the system in that it is difficult to enumerate long repeats. This limitation is shared by other techniques that detect single nucleotide additions such as [[pyrosequencing]].&lt;ref name="metzker"&gt;Metzker, M.L., [http://genome.cshlp.org/content/15/12/1767.abstract "Emerging technologies in DNA sequencing"]. Genome Res, 2005. 15(12): p. 1767-76.&lt;/ref&gt; Signals generated from a high repeat number are difficult to differentiate from repeats of a similar but different number; ''e.g.'', homorepeats of length 7 are difficult to differentiate from those of length 8.

Another limitation of this system is the short read length compared to other sequencing methods such as [[Sanger sequencing]] or [[pyrosequencing]]. Longer read lengths are beneficial for ''[[De novo transcriptome assembly|de novo]]'' [[genome assembly]]. Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencers produce an average read length of approximately 400 [[nucleotides]] per read.&lt;ref name="rusk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perkel"/&gt;

The throughput is currently lower than that of other high-throughput sequencing technologies, although the developers hope to change this by increasing the density of the [[semiconductor chip|chip]].&lt;ref name="rusk"/&gt;

== Application ==

The developers of Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing have marketed it as a rapid, compact and economical sequencer that can be utilized in a large number of laboratories as a bench top machine.&lt;ref name="rusk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ion torrent"/&gt; The company hopes that their system will take sequencing outside of specialized centers and into the reach of hospitals and smaller laboratories.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;Pollack, A., [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/05/health/05gene.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=hospitals Taking DNA Sequencing to the Masses], in New York Times. 2011: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; A January 2011 New York Times article, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/05/health/05gene.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=hospitals "Taking DNA Sequencing to the Masses"], underlines these ambitions.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

Due to the ability of [[DNA sequencing|alternative sequencing methods]] to achieve a greater read length (and therefore being more suited to [[genome assembly|whole genome analysis]]) this technology may be best suited to small scale applications such as [[microbial]] genome sequencing, microbial [[transcriptome]] sequencing, targeted sequencing, [[amplicon]] sequencing, or for quality testing of sequencing libraries.&lt;ref name="rusk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perkel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chiosea|first1=SI|last2=Williams|first2=L|last3=Griffith|first3=CC|last4=Thompson|first4=LD|last5=Weinreb|first5=I|last6=Bauman|first6=JE|last7=Luvison|first7=A|last8=Roy|first8=S|last9=Seethala|first9=RR|last10=Nikiforova|first10=MN|title=Molecular characterization of apocrine salivary duct carcinoma.|journal=The American Journal of Surgical Pathology|date=June 2015|volume=39|issue=6|pages=744–52|pmid=25723113|doi=10.1097/pas.0000000000000410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13038">'''Irving David "Irv" Rubin''' (April 12, 1945 – November 13, 2002) was chairman of the [[Jewish Defense League]] (JDL) from 1985 to 2002.  He died in mysterious circumstances in jail when awaiting trial on charges of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to bomb private and government property.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Tugend, [http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/18807/did-irv-rubin-attempt-to-commit-suicide-or-did-somebody-try-to-murder-him/], November 8, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and activism==
Rubin was born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].  He and his parents and sister moved to the  neighborhood of [[Granada Hills, California]], a suburb of [[Los Angeles]], which has a large [[Jewish]] population. He attained [[United States citizenship]] shortly thereafter, and served as a sergeant in the [[United States Air Force]] until he was honorably discharged.  He was a staunch supporter of the [[right to keep and bear arms]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Tugend, [http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/19243/edition_id/389/format/html/displaystory.html Did Irv Rubin attempt to commit suicide or did somebody try to murder him?], November 8, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Rubin offered a $500 [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] to anyone who would wound or kill a member of the [[American Nazi Party]]. Indicted on [[solicitation of murder]] charges, he was acquitted in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;"JDL's new leader was born in Montreal" ''The Gazette''. Montreal, Que.: Aug 20, 1985. pg. D.10. ''One controversial incident involved remarks Rubin made in Los Angeles on March 16, 1978: "We are offering $500, that I have in my hand, to any member of the community . . . who kills, maims or seriously injures a member of the American Nazi party." He spoke at a time when American Nazis were planning a march in Skokie, Ill., home to a large number of Jews, many of them survivors of the Holocaust. Rubin was charged with solicitation of murder. In 1981, he was acquitted.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish Defense League activism==
Rubin became the successor to JDL founder [[Rabbi Meir Kahane]], after Kahane moved to [[Israel]] in 1985 and formed the [[Kach Party]], which was eventually outlawed by the Israeli Government as "[[racist]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Law/Legal%20Issues%20and%20Rulings/THE%20KACH%20MOVEMENT%20-%20BACKGROUND%20-%2003-Mar-94 The Kach Movement – Background] Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 3 March 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, it was reported that Rubin said about the bombing of the home of historian and [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]] Dr. [[George Ashley]], "It's too bad that Mr. Ashley wasn't blown up" and "I applaud those who took such actions. I think these people have a righteous place in the world."&lt;ref&gt;The Daily Breeze, Torrance, CA, August 26, 1985, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Moderate Jews also criticized him. Rob Eshman, the Editor-in-Chief of the ''Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles'' noted "In the solar system of Jewish life, Irv Rubin is Pluto" and asserted "Here in Los Angeles, for years now Rubin has been escorted out of far more Jewish events than he’s ever been invited in to."&lt;ref&gt;Rob Eshman,[http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/searchview.php?id=7889 Follies], December 21, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, [[Alex Odeh]], the local chairman of the pro-[[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee]] (ADC) was killed by a bomb while opening the door to his [[Santa Ana, California]] office. Rubin was suspected, and further antagonized his opponents by saying that "Odeh got what he deserved." However, the JDL insisted the attack was committed by others. The [[FBI]] was unable to prove its original allegations. The crime remains unsolved. The investigation of Rubin was headed by FBI special agent Mary Hogan, the same agent who signed the affidavit accusing Rubin of planning to destroy government property and other targets in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intellectualconservative.com/2005/12/14/the-murder-of-earl-krugel-where%E2%80%99s-the-outrage/ The Murder of Earl Krugel: Where's the Outrage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102182739/http://www.intellectualconservative.com/2005/12/14/the-murder-of-earl-krugel-where%E2%80%99s-the-outrage/ |date=2007-11-02 }}; Tom Tugend, "Never Say Never Again]", ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', December 27, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before joining the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] in 2000, Irv Rubin was an active [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], and served as a page at the [[1964 Republican National Convention]], at which [[Barry Goldwater]] was nominated to run for the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Tugend, November 8, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Irv Rubin’s joining the Libertarian Party was greeted with shock by many members because of the allegations of terrorism against both the JDL and Rubin himself. Membership requires a pledge to not "initiate force."&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Defense League leader signs up with LP, JDL head: Jews "need the Second  Amendment", Libertarian Party News, March 2000 (formerly at {{cite web |url=http://www.lp.org/lpnews/0003/jdl.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050407182548/http://www.lp.org/lpnews/0003/jdl.html |archivedate=2005-04-07 |df= }}); Libertarian Party News, several Letters to Editor voicing objections, May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2001, Rubin let it be known that he was considering running for governor of California on the Libertarian ticket, renewing controversies among libertarians.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Garris,
[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig/garris2.html Irv Rubin and the Libertarian Party], June 26, 2000; Justin Raimondo column item, [http://www.antiwar.com/justin/j061400.html Terrorism and Libertarianism – a Truly Odd Couple], [[Antiwar.com]], June 14, 2000; Series of June to December, 2001 email exchanges on LPUS mailing list at http://www.dehnbase.org/lp/.&lt;/ref&gt;

To attempt disruption of the events, Rubin regularly attended rallies held by the [[KKK]] and [[Aryan Nations]]. He often brought some of his followers to assist. During the civil suit brought by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center|SPLC]] against the Aryan Nations founder and Pastor [[Richard Girnt Butler|Richard Butler]] held in [[Coeur d' Alene, Idaho]], in 2000, Rubin stayed for at least 4 days holding vigil during the proceedings. He frequently spoke out against Butler and his followers who were also holding vigil.

==Appearances on television==
Rubin also made a number of televised appearances during his lifetime. These include a lively 1988 debate on ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]]'' with [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] [[Steve Cokely]], shortly following a controversial lecture that Cokely gave in which he stated his belief that Jewish doctors were inoculating [[Black people|black]] babies with the [[HIV virus]] {{YouTube|DsX_Kmk29w8}}, appearing on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] documentary {{YouTube|ZyNr2D9lk2I|''Nazi America: A Secret History''}}, and a memorable October 22, 1997, appearance on the ''[[Jerry Springer Show]]'' where he and his bodyguards scuffled with members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] after he attacked a member of the KKK who mocked him by removing his hood to reveal a [[yarmulke]]. {{YouTube|3sFSGlFDlSM|'Klanfrontation'}}

==2001 conspiracy charges==
On December 12, 2001, Irv Rubin, JDL Chairman, and [[Earl Krugel]], a member of the organization, were charged with conspiracy to bomb private and government property. The two allegedly were caught in the act of planning bomb attacks against the King Fahd [[Mosque]] in [[Culver City, California]], and on the office of [[U.S. Representative]] [[Darrell Issa]], who is of Lebanese and Czech descent. The two were arrested as part of a [[sting operation]] after an FBI informant named Danny Gillis delivered [[explosive]]s to Krugel's home in L.A.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=7861 JDL Head Arrested], JewishJournal.com, December 14, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The JDL claims that Danny Gillis struck a deal with the FBI to neutralize the JDL by infiltrating the organization and by arranging criminal charges of its leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Fern Sidman, [http://www.jdl.org/information/chairman/hero.shtml  Today We Lost a True Hero] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107064323/http://www.jdl.org/information/chairman/hero.shtml |date=2007-11-07 }}, Jewish Defense League web page, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the Jewish Journal of Los Angeles, Gillis was a former JDL member who joined the organization due to conflicts with [[White power skinhead|white skinheads]].&lt;ref&gt;Mike Levy, [http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=8404 JDL Trial Set for October, Rubin, Krugel attorneys have been unable to speak with informant in bomb plot case], JewishJournal.com, April 12, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 2003, [[Earl Krugel]], Rubin's first lieutenant, pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges stemming from the plot.  This plea was later withdrawn by the presiding Judge, and he was charged with additional crimes which, if convicted, could result in a 55-year imprisonment in a federal penitentiary. The plea bargain was apparently reinstated in late September 2005, and the 62-year-old Krugel was sentenced to 20 years in federal detention, after an initial plea agreement based on his revealing the names of those involved in the Alex Odeh bomb plot was withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1109352,00.html Time Magazine Milestones]; Jim Crogan,[http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=14715 Krugel Gets 20 Years for Bomb Plot], September 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 4, 2005, he was killed by an inmate after having been transferred to a [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] federal prison. Another inmate struck Krugel on the head from behind with a cement block.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbsnews.com/stories/2005/11/06/national/main1015856.shtml JDL Activist Killed In Prison].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death in prison==
In November 2002, while imprisoned at the [http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/los/index.jsp Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles] awaiting trial, Rubin's throat was cut and then he tumbled off an 18- to 20-foot balcony. He had been threatening suicide in the days before. The injuries from the fall resulted in his death at Los Angeles County General Hospital several days later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021201125714/http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2002/11/14/172541.shtml Terror Suspect Irv Rubin Dies], November 15, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some people consider the circumstances surrounding his death to be suspicious, and Rubin's wife demanded an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2415761.stm Militant US Jew's 'suicide bid' challenged], November 7, 2002; Tom Tugend,  November 8, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; But defense attorney [[Mark Werksman]] said that Rubin had been despondent for months, losing 40 pounds, and that the pressure of an upcoming trial "may have pushed him over the top."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/West/11/04/rubin.suicide.attempt.reut/ JDL chairman Irv Rubin attempts suicide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313111804/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/West/11/04/rubin.suicide.attempt.reut/ |date=2007-03-13 }}, November 4, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rubin family launched a wrongful death suit against the government.&lt;ref name="family"&gt;"Family of JDL Leader Rubin Sues Gov't", ''[[Associated Press]]'', January 24, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Baillie''' (8 June 1902 – date of death unknown) was a Scottish professional [[Association football|footballer]].

==Career==
Born in [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire|Hamilton]], Baillie played for local youth side [[Wishaw Juniors F.C.|Wishaw]] before joining [[Derry Celtic F.C.|Derry Celtic]]. In 1926, he joined [[Football League First Division]] side [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Who's Who of Cardiff City | first = Dean | last = Hayes | publisher = Breedon Books | year = 2006 | p=16 | location=Derby | isbn= 1-85983-462-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with several established players such as [[Fred Keenor]] and [[Harry Wake]] in the side, Baillie struggled to break into the first team.&lt;ref name="Hayes"/&gt; He made his professional debut on 25 September 1926 in a 2–0 defeat to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] but made only three further appearances during the 1926–27 season.&lt;ref name="Shepherd"&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Definitive: Cardiff City F.C. | first=Richard | last=Shepherd | publisher=SoccerData Publications | year=2002 | p=47 | location=Nottingham | isbn=1-899-46817-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he made just one appearance during a 5–1 defeat to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], his last appearance for the first team.&lt;ref name="Shepherd"/&gt;

'''James Nicholas Gray''' (born 1944; disappeared 2007) was an American [[computer scientist]] who received the [[Turing Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Jim|title=Jim Gray - A.M. Turing Award Winner|year=1998|publisher=ACM|url=http://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/gray_3649936.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in 1998 "for seminal contributions to [[database]] and [[transaction processing]] research and technical leadership in system implementation".

==Early years and personal life==
Gray was born in [[San Francisco]], the second child of Ann Emma Sanbrailo, who was a teacher and James Able Gray, who was in the U.S. Army; the family moved to [[Rome]] where Gray spent most of the first three years of his life, learning to speak Italian before English.&lt;ref name="oralhist"/&gt;  The family then moved to [[Virginia]], spending about four years there, until Gray's parents divorced, after which he returned to San Francisco with his mother.&lt;ref name="oralhist"/&gt; His father, an amateur inventor, patented a design for a ribbon cartridge for [[typewriter]]s that earned him a substantial royalty stream.&lt;ref name="oralhist"/&gt;

After being turned down for the [[Air Force Academy]] he entered the [[University of California, Berkeley]] as a freshman in 1961.&lt;ref name="oralhist"/&gt;  To help pay for college he worked as a [[Cooperative education|co-op]] for [[General Dynamics]], where he learned to use a [[Monroe calculator]].  Discouraged by his chemistry grades, he left Berkeley for six months, returning after an experience in industry he later described as "dreadful".&lt;ref name="oralhist"/&gt; Gray earned his [[B.S.]] in Engineering Mathematics (Math and Statistics) in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faircom.com/ace/enl_29_jimgray_t.php|title=Biography of Dr. Jim Gray|work=faircom.com|accessdate=2 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703072957/http://www.faircom.com/ace/enl_29_jimgray_t.php|archivedate=3 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After marrying, Gray moved with his wife Loretta to [[New Jersey]], his wife's home state; she got a job as a teacher and he got one at [[Bell Labs]] working on a digital simulation that was to be part of [[Multics]]. At Bell, he worked three days a week and spent two days as a Master's student at New York University's [[Courant Institute]]. After a year they traveled for several months before settling again in Berkeley, where Gray entered graduate school with [[Michael A. Harrison]] as his advisor. In 1969 he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[programming language]]s, then did two years of post-doctoral work for IBM.&lt;ref name="oralhist"/&gt;

While at Berkeley, Gray and Loretta had a daughter; they were later divorced. His second wife was Donna Carnes.

==Research==
Gray pursued his career primarily working as a researcher and [[software design]]er at a number of industrial companies, including [[IBM]], [[Tandem Computers]], and [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]. He joined [[Microsoft]] in 1995 and was a Technical Fellow for the company&lt;ref name="wisc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Transaction Processing: Concepts and Techniques'' (with Andreas Reuter) (1993). {{ISBN|1-55860-190-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Benchmark Handbook: For Database and Transaction Processing Systems'' (1991).

Gray contributed to several major database and transaction processing systems. [[IBM System R|IBM's System R]] was the precursor of the SQL relational databases that have become a standard throughout the world. For Microsoft, he worked on [[TerraServer-USA]] and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey#Data access|Skyserver]].

==Disappearance==
[[File:Jim Gray on Tenacious 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|Jim Gray on his yacht in 2006]]
Gray, an experienced sailor, owned a forty-foot yacht. On January 28, 2007 he failed to return from a short solo trip to the [[Farallon Islands]] near [[San Francisco]] to scatter his mother's ashes.
The weather was clear, and no distress call was received, nor was any signal detected from the boat's automatic [[Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon]].

A four-day [[Coast Guard]] search using planes, helicopters, and boats found nothing.&lt;ref name="sfgate"&gt;{{cite news | date = January 29, 2007 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/01/29/BAGB5NR0GL6.DTL | title = Coast Guard searches for missing SF boater: 63-year-old man failed to return from trip to Farallon Islands | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sfgate2"&gt;{{cite news | date = January 30, 2007 | url = http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/01/30/BAGGTNR93G1.DTL&amp;type=printable | title = Sea search for missing Microsoft scientist:  No sign of S.F. man who set out alone for Farallon Islands in 40-foot sailboat | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | first=Jim | last=Doyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sfgate4"&gt;{{cite news | date = January 31, 2007 | url = http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/01/31/BAGTONS9084.DTL&amp;type=printable | title = Search for missing sailor extends to Humboldt | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | first1=Tanya | last1=Schevitz | first2=Steve | last2=Rubenstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sfgate5"&gt;{{cite news | date = January 31, 2007 | url = http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/01/31/MNGPMNRVD137.DTL&amp;type=printable | title = Vast search off coast for data wizard | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | first1=Meredith | last1=May | first2=Jim | last2=Doyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Hicklenton''' (8 May 1967 – 19 March 2010), aka '''John Deadstock''', was a British [[comics artist]] best known for his brutal, visceral work on flagship ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' characters like ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' (in particular ''Heavy Metal Dredd'') and ''[[Nemesis the Warlock]]'' during the Eighties and Nineties.

He suffered from [[multiple sclerosis]] and recorded an award-winning documentary about living with the condition. On 19 March 2010, Hicklenton chose to end his life at [[Dignitas (euthanasia group)|Dignitas]] in Switzerland.

==Comics==
Hicklenton got his first break when he realised a friend at college was [[Ron Smith (artist)|Ron Smith]]'s daughter so he made her a Judge Dredd Christmas card.&lt;ref name=2kreview&gt;{{cite web |first=Gavin |last=Hanly |url=http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/features/interviews/2006/hicklenton/john-hicklenton.shtml |title=John Hicklenton interview |publisher=2000 AD Review |date=5 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012212455/http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/features/interviews/2006/hicklenton/john-hicklenton.shtml |archivedate=12 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, regular work remained elusive until, on the advice of his mother, he phoned [[Pat Mills]] directly and their working relationship developed from there.  He did other work with Mills including a strip in the now defunct CoolBeansWorld site. He also drew ''ZombieWorld'' (as John Deadstock) for [[Dark Horse Comics]], who commissioned him because, as Mills has said "John is the ultimate horror artist ... I defy anyone to show me an artist whose monsters are more grotesque, whose [[zombie]]s have a more ghastly look in their eye."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040121125026/http://www.darkhorse.com/news/interviews.php?id=684 Pat Mills interview], Dark Horse.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Here's Johnny''==
He was diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]] in 2000. ''Here's Johnny'', a documentary about his illness produced by [http://www.animalmonday.co.uk/ Animal Monday],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heresjohnnyfilm.com/ Here's Johnny documentary (2008)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514094924/http://www.heresjohnnyfilm.com/ |date=14 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; launched at the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] on 30 January 2008, followed by its world première at the South by Southwest film festival in Austin, Texas. It got its television debut on ''[[More4]]'' on 17 February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/programmes/heres-johnny Here's Johnny] at Channel Four&lt;/ref&gt; The film took over 5 years to make and documents his brave and often humorous battle against MS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitolvalley.net/2008/03/i-had-to-write-about-this-tota.html March 2008 interview at American premiere of documentary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314181011/http://www.capitolvalley.net/2008/03/i-had-to-write-about-this-tota.html |date=14 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/3353142/MS-%27I-am-very-angry-about-this-disease%27.html MS: 'I am very angry about this disease'], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 8 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The film was favourably reviewed by the ''[[British Medical Journal]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heresjohnnyfilm.com/assets/pdf/british_medical_journal.pdf BMJ review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706131011/http://www.heresjohnnyfilm.com/assets/pdf/british_medical_journal.pdf |date= 6 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008 won an unprecedented two [[Grierson Awards]] for "Best Newcomer"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.griersontrust.org/sl_newcomer.htm Best Newcomer Grierson Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112005806/http://www.griersontrust.org/sl_newcomer.htm |date=12 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Best Arts Documentary".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041015080539/http://www.griersontrust.org/sl_arts.htm Best Arts Documentary Grierson Award]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent activities==
He continued to draw, working on projects like ''Sand'' for Renegade Arts Entertainment,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renegadeartsentertainment.com/comics/sand/ ''Sand'']{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at Renegade Arts Entertainment&lt;/ref&gt; and also focused on bringing multiple sclerosis as a disease to the public's attention in order to help its sufferers fight for better treatment and research from the medical community.  In his final year he wrote and illustrated his graphic novel, 100 Months (published by Cutting Edge Press), which he finished the day before he died.

==Death==
On 23 March 2010 Pat Mills announced via the ''2000 AD'' [[Internet forum|forums]] that Hicklenton had died the previous week following his battle with multiple sclerosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/comics/news/a210293/artist-john-hicklenton-dies-aged-42.html|title=Artist John Hicklenton dies, aged 42|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Mark|last=Langshaw|date=23 March 2010|accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forbiddenplanet.co.uk/blog/2010/john-hicklenton-passes-away/|title=John Hicklenton passes away|publisher=[[Forbidden Planet (bookstore)|Forbidden Planet]]|accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hicklenton had travelled to Switzerland and died on 19 March at [[Dignitas (euthanasia group)|Dignitas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Gurner |url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/5084731.Brighton_man_dies_at_Swiss_euthanasia_clinic/ |title=Johnny Hicklenton dies at Swiss euthanasia clinic |work=[[Brighton Argus]] |date=26 March 2010 |accessdate=26 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7527788/Comic-book-artist-ends-life-at-suicide-clinic-after-battle-with-MS.html |title=Comic book artist ends life at suicide clinic after battle with MS |work=The Daily Telegraph  |date=26 March 2010 |accessdate=26 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/8590231.stm |title=Judge Dredd artist dies at suicide centre Dignitas |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=26 March 2010 |accessdate=26 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/tv-radio-obituaries/7545855/John-Hicklenton.html |title=John Hicklenton |work=The Daily Telegraph  |date=1 April 2010 |accessdate=2 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Till Allingham''' ({{circa|1776}}–1812)&lt;ref name="nonconform"&gt;John Till Allingham in the ''England &amp; Wales, Non-Conformist and Non-Parochial Registers, 1567-1970''&lt;/ref&gt; was an English dramatist.
[[File:John Till Allingham.jpg|thumb|John Till Allingham]]

==Life==
Allingham was the son of a wine merchant in the city of London. He was brought up to the profession of the law, but is known as a successful and prolific dramatist. In his ''Life of John Kemble'' (1825), [[James Boaden]] suggested his early death was caused by drinking.

==Works==
Allingham's afterpiece, ''[[Fortune's Frolic]]'', first produced at [[Covent Garden Theatre]] in 1799, long enjoyed popularity, and the leading character Robin Roughhead wasplayed by celebrated actors. His second play, ''[[Tis all a Farce]]'', was produced at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in 1800. Others of his works were: the ''[[Marriage Promise]]'', a comedy with music by Michael Kelly, produced at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] 1803; ''Mrs. Wiggins'', a farce in two acts, produced at the Haymarket in 1803; ''Hearts of Oak'', a comedy, produced at Drury Lane in 1803; ''The Weathercock'', a farce, produced at Drury Lane in 1805; the ''Romantic Lover'', a comedy, produced at Covent Garden in 1806, and "damned", wrote [[John Genest]].

Plays attributed to Allingham include: ''Who wins? or the Widow's Choice'', a musical farce, produced at Covent Garden in 1808; ''Independence, or the Trustee'', produced at Covent Garden in 1809; ''Transformation, or Love and Law'', a musical farce, produced by the Drury Lane company at the Lyceum Theatre in 1810. Much of the success of Allingham's plays was due to the ability and popularity of [[Charles Mathews]]. [[George Henry Harlow]] painted a portrait of the actor as Mr. Wiggins in the farce of ''Mrs. Wiggins''.

Allingham died aged 36 and was buried in March 1812 at [[Bunhill Fields]].&lt;ref name="nonconform"/&gt;

[[Image:Kitfry-1-.jpg|thumb|350px|The Fry-Jefferson map of the royal colony of Virginia (1752).]]

Colonel '''Joshua Fry''' (1699–1754) was a surveyor, adventurer, mapmaker, soldier, and member of the [[House of Burgesses]], the legislature of the [[colony of Virginia]].  He is best known for collaborating with [[Peter Jefferson]], the father of future U.S. president [[Thomas Jefferson]], on an influential map of Virginia in 1752, and being the immediate predecessor of [[George Washington]] as commanding officer of the [[Virginia Regiment]], a key unit in the military developments that led to the outbreak of the [[French and Indian War]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Crewkerne]], [[Somerset]], England, he moved to [[Essex County, Virginia]] as a young man to marry the wealthy widow Mary Micou Hill, who bore him five children who grew to adulthood: John, Henry, Martha, William, and Margaret. He was educated at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and after his arrival from England was made professor of natural philosophy and mathematics at the [[College of William &amp; Mary]]. He was afterward a member of the House of Burgesses, and served on the commission appointed to determine the Virginia and [[North Carolina]] boundary-line.&lt;ref name="appletons"&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Fry, Joshua|year=1900}} which in turn cites his life by Philip Slaughter (New York, 1880).&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1743-1744 Fry and his family moved to what is now [[Albemarle County, Virginia]] to claim unclaimed plots of land and take advantage of surveying opportunities. There he built a house called Viewmont that sat on a {{convert|800|acre|km2|sing=on}} plantation bordering the [[Hardware River]]. He was a colonel of militia and a member of the governor's council in 1750, and in 1752 was a commissioner to treat with the Indians at Logtown.&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt; Fry, along with fellow member of the ''Loyal Land Company'', Peter Jefferson, created the Maryland-Virginia ''Fry-Jefferson Map'' in 1752. 

In the early days of the [[French and Indian War]], Fry was given the title of Commander-in-Chief of colonial forces, and given command of the [[Virginia Regiment]] and was ordered to take [[Fort Duquesne]], then held by the French.  During the advance into the [[Ohio Country]], Fry suddenly fell off his horse and died from his injuries on 31 May 1754 at [[Fort Cumberland (Maryland)|Fort Cumberland]], Maryland. A young Virginia officer, George Washington, succeeded Fry in command of the regiment. [[James Innes (North Carolina)|James Innes]] of North Carolina briefly succeeded Fry as Commander-in-Chief.  Joshua Fry is buried in an [[unmarked grave]] within the [[Rose Hill Cemetery (Cumberland, Maryland)|Rose Hill Cemetery]] in [[Cumberland, Maryland]].

In [[science fiction]], a '''Jovian''' is an inhabitant of the planet [[Jupiter]].

==Jovians in literature==
* In [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu Mythos]] (1928&amp;ndash;...), Jupiter was the one-time home of the [[flying polyp]]s.
* ''The Conquest of Two Worlds'' (1932) by [[Edmond Hamilton]]. Humans explore the solar system and discover intelligent life on Mars and Jupiter, and proceed to ruthlessly conquer and subjugate it. Jupiter is a humid jungle world with high gravity. The natives are friendly, hairless beings with thick hands and legs ending in flippers, small heads and large dark eyes.
* In [[Isaac Asimov]]'s short story ''[[Victory Unintentional]]'' (1942), human colonists on [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] send robots to Jupiter to contact the Jovians, who are planning a war with the humans.
* In [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''Three Worlds to Conquer'', sympathetic [[Centaur]]-like Jovians are in danger of extinction by cruel invaders from another region of the planet. At the same time their friends, the human colonists of [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], are threatened by a powerful space warship commanded by a dictatorial militarist. Eventually, the two groups find ingenious ways to help each other defeat their respective enemies.
* In ''[[Skeleton Men of Jupiter]]'' (1943), the eleventh and last ''[[Barsoom]]'' book by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], the hero [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]] is kidnapped and taken to Jupiter (also called "Sasoom" in the Barsoom franchise) by its inhabitants called the Morgors (also called "Skeleton Men" because they look like walking human skeletons). Jupiter is described as a harsh world warmed only by volcanoes, with forests of sentient trees.
* [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[A Meeting with Medusa]]'' (1972) proposes giant mile sized medusa-like creatures living in Jupiter's atmosphere.
* [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]'' (1982) depicts city-sized, [[cloud]]-like creatures, [[squid]]-like animals, and creatures resembling terrestrial [[aircraft]].
* [[Ben Bova]]'s novel ''[[Jupiter (novel)|Jupiter]]'' (2001) also features massive whale-like creatures kilometers long living in the liquid stage of Jupiter's atmosphere and are pictured as being [[Extraterrestrial life|intelligent]].
* In the [[Larklight Trilogy]] by [[Philip Reeve]], Jupiter's moons are inhabited by a variety of races. The planet itself has sentient storms the largest of which, Old Thunderhead, is worshipped as a God.  The planet also possesses floating creatures that resemble animals in Earth's oceans.
* ''The Gobsmacking Galaxy'', an entry in the children's non-fiction series ''The Knowledge'' written by [[Kjartan Poskitt]], humorously describes hypothetical alien life forms which might evolve on planets in the solar system; the Jovian is portrayed as a creature comparable to a massive [[hot air balloon]] which has learned to subsist on the radiation in Jupiter's atmosphere.

==In comics==
* In the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic book series ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', [[Charlie-27]] is from Jupiter and, being genetically engineered to survive in Jupiter's high gravity, which according to this is 11 times stronger than that of Earth, is stronger and tougher than a normal human. He is the last Jovian; all the others were wiped out by the [[Badoon]] invasion in the [[31st century]].
* In Indian cartoonist ''[[Pran Kumar Sharma|Pran]]'s'' [[Chacha Chaudhary]] series, one of the main characters [[Sabu (comics)|Sabu]] is a Jupiter native, but lives on earth with his best pal Chacha Chaudhary. Whenever Sabu is angry, it causes a volcanic eruption on the surface of Jupiter.
* In the original timeline of the [[Gundam]] metaverse, space colonies were established near Jupiter in order to harvest the planet's helium 3 as a power source. Generations later, the colonists rebelled against Earth, forming a "Jupiter Empire". All members referred to themselves as Jovians, and a select few even provoked their opponents by claiming that they were like sci-fi aliens, having been born apart from the human race on earth. The events of this war against the Jovians are depicted in the manga ''[[Crossbone Gundam]]''.
* In ''All-Star Comics'' #13, [[Starman (comics)|Starman]] finds Jupiter to be inhabited by flying people. By creating a giant cosmic rod, Starman helps them send dangerous matter from the [[Great Red Spot]] into space, and is rewarded by being given the means to make metal invisible.
* In ''[[Marvel Family]]'' #36, the Marvels go to Jupiter, which according to this story has gravity 300 times stronger than Earth (it actually has gravity nearly 2.3 times stronger), meaning they are much shorter than humans. They are an advanced and peaceful race, capable of interplanetary travel, and their scientific equipment helps the Marvels discover the nature of the Invaders from Infinity, which resemble giant fireballs, (see [[List of Captain Marvel (DC Comics) enemies]]). The Jovians are forced to evacuate after their fleet is defeated by the Invaders, but after the Invaders are contained and destroyed they get back to Jupiter, and tell the Marvels they will be their friends.
* As a boy, [[Superman|Clark Kent]] meets an eight-armed inhabitant of Jupiter publicly promoting an "Interplanetary Circus" (''Adventure Comics'' #198, Mar 1954: "The Super-Carnival from Space").

==In animated film and television==
* The plot of the [[anime]] ''[[Martian Successor Nadesico]]'' (1996) revolves around a mysterious invasion force based on Jupiter, named the "Jovian Lizards", or simply the "Jovians", and the attempts of Earth's forces, and specifically the ship ''Nadesico'', to subdue this invasion.
* In the [[Looney Tunes]] short ''[[Jumpin' Jupiter]]'' (1955), Porky and Sylvester's desert campground is sliced away and towed into outer space by a green, bird-like Jovian searching for earthly animal life. But Porky remains blissfully unaware, leaving Sylvester to be terrorized by the alien. In another episode this bird creature appears to be from Mars.
* In ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'', specifically ''[[Victory Gundam]]'' and ''[[Crossbone Gundam]]'', the main enemies are from Jupiter and are known as the ''Jovian Fleet''.

==In video games==
* The character Xûr from [[Destiny (video game)|''Destiny'']] (2014) is a Jovian, but not necessarily from Jupiter. The game classifies Jovians as a race of transformed humans that live in the darkness beyond "The Reef".

==In philosophy==
* The Danish physicist and philosopher [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] discussed the scientific, moral, and aesthetic convictions of the inhabitants of Jupiter in a [[thought experiment]] in the essay "All Existence a Dominion of Reason" of 1846.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ørsted|first=Hans Christian|title=The soul in nature: with supplementary contributions (p. 91-133) |publisher=Henry G. Bohn, London|year=1852|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Du0AAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=The+soul+in+nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''János Imreffy de Szerdahely''' (''Imreffi''; c. 1559-60&amp;nbsp;– 9 July 1611)&lt;ref name='Markó_108'&gt;Markó 2006, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] soldier and noble in the [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]], who served as [[Chancellor of Transylvania]] from Spring 1610 to his death on 9 July 1611. He was a member of the [[Imreffy family]] of old origin.

==Biography==
János Imreffy was a grandson of [[Mihály Imreffy]], castellan of [[Buda Castle|Buda]]. His parents were János, Sr. and Margit Forgách de Ghymes et Gács. He inhretied [[Sládkovičovo|Diószeg]] (today: ''Sládkovičovo, Slovakia'') from his mother. He moved to [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Transylvania]] at young age. He married Kata Iffjú, daughter of János Iffjú, a member of the Transylvanian Royal Council and Margit Majláth. Due to that marriage, he became relative to the [[Báthory family|Báthory de Somlyó family]], because his wife was half-sister of [[Balthasar Báthory]], Stephen Báthory (father of [[Gabriel Báthory]]) and Cardinal [[Andrew Báthory]]. Imreffy also became the lord of [[Vințu de Jos|Alvinc]] (today: ''Vinţu de Jos, Romania'').

In 1593, he served envoy of [[Sigismund Báthory]] to Christoph Teuffenbach, Captain General of [[Košice|Kassa]] (today: ''Košice, Slovakia''). After 1598, he moved to the ''[[Partium]]'' where served as familiar of [[Judge royal]] Stephen Báthory de Ecsed. There he met [[Gabriel Báthory]] for the first time. Imreffy joined to [[Stephen Bocskay]]'s War of Independence and became a member of the Royal Council. He also functioned as the treasurer of Bocskay's army in the summer of 1605. He successfully crushed the rebellion of [[Serbian people|Serb]] militia in [[Lipova, Arad|Lippa]] (today: ''Lipova, Romania'').

He had an active role in the election of Gabriel Báthory as [[Prince of Transylvania]] in 1608. Since then he served as President of the Royal Council. After the betrayal of [[István Kendi]], who tried to murder Prince Gabriel, Imreffy was appointed Chancellor of Transylvania. Soon, the Transylvanian Civil War broke out. He was killed in the Battle of [[Brașov|Brassó]] (today: ''Brașov, Romania'') against [[Radu Şerban]] in 1611.

'''Kelemedi Rakuve Bulewa''' {{IPA-fj|ke le me ndi mbu le wa|}} (May 16, 1951 – 2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daurewa|first1=Alisi Waqanika|title=Is there truth in Fijian history?|url=http://vutikalulu.blogspot.co.nz/|website=Vutikalulu|accessdate=30 October 2015|date=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Fiji]]an lawyer and former politician, who served as [[Attorney General of Fiji]] from 1992 to 1996. 

Bulewa was known for his strongly pro-[[Fijians|ethnic Fijian]] views and was often associated with the nationalist [[Taukei movement]] that was supportive of the [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|1987 coups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lal|first1=Brij V.|title=In the Eye of the Storm: Jai Ram Reddy and the Politics of Postcolonial Fiji|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=tzqfQ6Q2rwUC&amp;pg=PA573&amp;lpg=PA573&amp;dq=%22Kelemedi+Bulewa%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0UqJK-WIE4&amp;sig=HHq6YhPN0JG9xR00-H5jjcna71s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwB2oVChMI7uDf4prqyAIVhJ2UCh0T3g8z#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Kelemedi%20Bulewa%22&amp;f=false|website=Google Books|publisher=ANU E Press, 2010|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bulewa was elected to the [[House of Representatives of Fiji|House of Representatives]] in the [[Fijian general election, 1992|1992 election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Members of the House of Representatives|url=http://www.appf.org.pe/countries/fiji/houser/members.htm|website=House of Representatives Members|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first post-coup election, and was appointed Attorney General later that year upon the resignation of [[Apaitia Seru]].

Bulewa disagreed with, and attempted to change, laws dating from [[Colony of Fiji|colonial times]], that repressed the practice of the pre-Christian Fijian religion, saying that while he was not advocating it, he believed that freedom to practice it should be allowed for. Although most [[Fijians]] were now Christians, he said, many had only reluctantly abandoned worship of their ancestral gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newson|first1=Leanne|last2=Aldous|first2=Jules|title=The Legal Maze: VCE Units 1 &amp; 2|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=C6PN-8VcYcAC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=%22Kelemedi+Bulewa%22+%2B+%22died%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6L_dMU7W-0&amp;sig=GP3PHKL0zF5b0SPrkL1R_OudLpg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwA2oVChMIgdz4spvqyAIVwrqUCh3FcAwz#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Kelemedi%20Bulewa%22%20%2B%20%22died%22&amp;f=false|website=The Legal Maze: VCE Units 1 &amp; 2|publisher=Macmillan Education AU, 2005|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulewa was supportive of calls for the dependency of [[Rotuma]] to be given self-government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Enasio|first1=Henry|title=Fiji's new constitution|url=http://www.rotuma.net/os/Forum/Enasio_Fiji's_Constitution.pdf|publisher=www.rotuma.net|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luisel Ramos''' (12 April 1984 &amp;ndash; August 2, 2006) was a [[Uruguay]]an [[model (person)|model]].

==Death==
On August 2, 2006, at 9:15 p.m., Ramos died of [[heart failure]] caused by [[anorexia nervosa]]&lt;ref name="Anorexia"&gt;{{cite web| date = November 18, 2006| url =http://www.libertypost.org/cgi-bin/readart.cgi?ArtNum=166746| title = Tomato diet model dies of anorexia | publisher =Liberty Post| accessdate =2006-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; while participating in a fashion show during [[Fashion Week]] in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]]. Ramos had felt ill after walking the runway and subsequently fainted on her way back to the dressing room. She died at the age of 22. Ramos' father told police that she had gone "several days" without eating. She was reported to have adopted a diet of [[lettuce]] and [[Diet Coke]] for the three months before her death.&lt;ref name="Diet"&gt;{{cite news| date = October 5, 2006| url =http://www.theage.com.au/news/eating-disorder/survival-of-the-thinnest/2006/10/05/1159641434825.html| title = Survival of the thinnest| publisher =The Age| accessdate =2006-11-27 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of her death she had a [[body mass index]] (BMI) of just 14.5. She weighed 44 kg (96.8 lbs) at a height of 1.75 m (5 ft 9 in).&lt;ref name="Weight"&gt;{{cite web| date = September 21, 2006| url =http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-406316/This-model-sparked-size-zero-debate.html?in_article_id=406316&amp;in_page_id=1770| title = This is the model who sparked size zero debate| publisher =The Daily Mail| accessdate =2006-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] classifies a BMI of under 16 as severe thinness.&lt;ref name=WHOBMI&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Database on Body Mass Index|url=http://apps.who.int/bmi/index.jsp?introPage=intro_3.html|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of Ramos' death, Madrid Fashion Week (held in September 2006) set a minimum BMI of 18 for all models.&lt;ref name="Diet"/&gt; In December that year, Italian fashion designers banned [[size zero]] models from walking down their [[catwalk]]s.&lt;ref name="Italian designers ban skinny models"&gt;{{cite web| date = Dec 19, 2006| url =http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=423522&amp;in_page_id=1770| title = Italian fashion designers ban size zero models from the catwalks| publisher =Daily Mail| accessdate =2007-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

On February 13, 2007, Luisel's 18-year-old sister [[Eliana Ramos]], also a model, died at her grandparents' home in Montevideo of an apparent [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]],&lt;ref name="Sister heart attack"&gt;{{cite news| date = February 15, 2007| url =http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/sister-models-both-starve/2007/02/15/1171405328301.html| title = Family tragedy as two sisters, both models, die| publisher =Sydney Morning Herald| accessdate =2007-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; believed to be related to [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref name="Sister"&gt;{{cite news| date = February 14, 2007| url =http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/second-model-sister-dies-of-malnutrition/2007/02/14/1171405285731.html| title = Second model sister dies of malnutrition| publisher =Sydney Morning Herald| accessdate =2007-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Monster''''' is a 2003 [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Crime film|crime]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Patty Jenkins]]. The film is about [[serial killer]] [[Aileen Wuornos]], a former [[Prostitution|prostitute]] who was [[Capital punishment|executed]] in Florida in 2002 for killing six men (she was not tried for a seventh murder) in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Wuornos was played by [[Charlize Theron]]; her semi-fictionalized lover, Selby Wall (based on Wuornos's real-life girlfriend Tyria Moore), was played by [[Christina Ricci]].

Theron received critical acclaim and won numerous  awards for her portrayal, including the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama|Golden Globe Award for Best Actress]] and the [[Screen Actors Guild Award]]s for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role|Outstanding Lead Actress]]. ''Monster'' was produced by [[Denver &amp; Delilah Films]] and K/W Productions and distributed by [[Newmarket Films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rooney|first1=David|title=Monster|url=https://variety.com/2003/film/awards/monster-2-1200537925/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 17, 2003|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Honeycutt|first1=Kirk|title=Monster|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=2030577|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=November 18, 2003|accessdate=17 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031231212039/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=2030577|archivedate=December 31, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In 1989, after moving from [[Michigan]] to [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], [[Prostitution|prostitute]] [[Aileen Wuornos]] meets Selby Wall in a [[gay bar]]. Although she is initially hostile and declares that she is not [[gay]], Aileen talks to Selby over a drink of beer. Selby takes to Aileen almost immediately, as she likes that she is very protective of her. Selby invites Aileen to spend the night with her. The two women return to the house where Selby is staying (temporarily exiled by her parents following the accusation from another girl that Selby tried to kiss her). They later agree to meet at a [[roller skating]] rink, and they kiss for the first time. Aileen and Selby fall in love, but they have nowhere to go, so Selby goes back to her aunt's home.

After being violently [[Rape|sexually assaulted]] and brutalized by a client, Vincent Corey, Aileen kills him in self-defense and decides to quit prostitution. She confesses her actions to Selby, who has been angry with her for her failure to support both of them. Aileen struggles to find legitimate work, but because of her lack of qualifications and criminal history, prospective employers reject her and are occasionally openly hostile. Desperate for money, Aileen returns to prostitution. She robs and kills her [[Procuring (prostitution)|johns]], each killed in a more brutal way than the last, as she is convinced that they are all trying to rape her. She spares one man out of pity when he admits he has never had sex with a prostitute, but eventually kills another man who, instead of exploiting her, offers help. Aileen uses the money she stole from her victims to support herself and Selby.

However, Selby reads in the newspapers about the string of murders, and she begins to suspect that Aileen may have committed them. She confronts Aileen, who justifies her actions by claiming she had only been protecting herself. Horrified, Selby returns to [[Ohio]] on a charter bus. The night of her arrest, Aileen is approached by two [[bounty hunters]] luring her outside to hand her to the cops. Thomas, whom Aileen always referred to as the only friend she had, tries to save her from getting arrested by stealing her away from the two men that approached her. Thomas offers to drive her off but Aileen declines, no longer trusting herself with the well-being of anyone dear to her. Aileen is eventually arrested at a [[biker bar]] and speaks to Selby one last time while in jail. Selby reveals some incriminating information over the telephone and Aileen realizes that the police are listening in. To protect Selby and Thomas, Aileen admits that she committed the murders alone. During Aileen's trial, Selby testifies against her, with Aileen's loving consent. Aileen is convicted of the murders and [[Death penalty|sentenced to death]]. On October 9, 2002, Aileen is executed by [[lethal injection]].

==Reception==
Film critics praised ''Monster''; most gave overwhelmingly high praise to Theron's performance as a [[Mental illness|mentally ill]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer]]''. Dir. [[Nick Broomfield]] and Joan Churchill. Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; woman – Wuornos had [[antisocial personality disorder]] and [[borderline personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/wuornos805.htm|title=Aileen Carol Wuornos #805|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the role, Theron gained {{convert|30|lb}}, shaved her eyebrows, and wore [[prosthetic]] teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/slideshow/Movie-transformations-49438/photo-3487212.php | title=Movie transformations | publisher=SFGate | date=November 1, 2012 | accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics called her performance, and her makeup, a "transformation".&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web | title = Monster | publisher = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1128647-monster/ | accessdate = 2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] named it best film of the year, and wrote "What Charlize Theron achieves in Patty Jenkins' 'Monster' isn't a performance but an embodiment... [It] is one of the greatest performances in the history of the cinema."&lt;ref name= "ebert"&gt;{{cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | coauthors = | title = ''Monster'' | work = | pages = | publisher = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = January 1, 2004 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040101/REVIEWS/40310032/1023 | accessdate = 2010-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ricci's performance also drew some praise, but was not without criticism. In his review for the film, Ebert praised her performance, stating "Christina Ricci finds the right note for Selby Wall – so correct some critics have mistaken it for bad acting, when in fact it is sublime acting in its portrayal of a bad actor. She plays Selby as clueless, dim, in over her head, picking up cues from moment to moment, cobbling her behavior out of notions borrowed from bad movies, old songs, and barroom romances".&lt;ref name="ebert" /&gt;

However, several people who knew Aileen, criticised the movie for portraying her as a victim and portraying her victims as villains.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2004/02/08/more-of-a-monster-than-hollywood-could-picture/179c7282-5e25-4eb5-8980-c72aa90efdb0/?noredirect=on&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://abcnews.go.com/2020/GiveMeABreak/story?id=124320&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Theron won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[List of Golden Globe Awards: Film, Best Actress, Drama|Best Actress in a Drama]] and the [[Screen Actors Guild#SAG Awards|SAG Award]] for her performance.

In 2009, Ebert named it the third best film of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The Best Films of the Decade |first = Roger |last = Ebert |authorlink = Roger Ebert |url = http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/the-best-films-of-the-decade |work = rogerebert.com |date = December 30, 2009 | accessdate = June 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Review website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 81% of critics gave the film a positive review, with a "Certified Fresh" and an average score of 7.2/10. The site's critical consensus states: "Charlize Theron gives a searing, deglamorized performance as real life serial killer Aileen Wuornos in ''Monster'', an intense, disquieting portrait of a profoundly damaged soul."

'''''Monster Rancher 3''''' (known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Monster Farm 3'''''|モンスターファーム3|Monsutā Fāmu Surī}}) is the third game in [[Tecmo]]'s [[Monster Rancher]] series. It is the first game in the [[Monster Rancher|''Monster Rancher'' series]] for the [[PlayStation 2]].

==Differences==
This game uses [[cel-shaded]] graphics to give the game a more cartoon-like feel. However, the player may still generate monsters by inserting a disc into the PS2. Furthermore, ''Monster Rancher 3'' is the first game in the series to allow players the ability to generate monsters based on past discs, as well as monsters already bred. As an example, once a monster has been bred, from that point on one can simply generate them from their Monster Encyclopedia, saving the gamer unnecessary time and trouble having to remember and find discs that generated various monsters. Also, ''Monster Rancher 3'' is the first and currently only ''Monster Rancher'' game to allow players to trade monster data. By inserting memory cards for both players, it is possible to transfer monsters in one player's Monster Encyclopedia to another player's file.

==Characters==

===General===

====Fleria====
A young Tochikan girl who serves as your guide throughout the story. Never leaving your side, she acts as though you couldn't possibly survive without her help, but it is revealed that she needed your help to become a breeder in the first place. She is somewhat bossy, but is kind nonetheless.  She harbors a dislike for Gadamon and was mentored by "Ms." Jenna.

====Bragma====
Bragma is Fleria's grandfather who runs the Monster Shrine. He is slightly stubborn, but wise. He has a past which he seems a little embarrassed by.

====Mucchi====
A peddler.  He sells various items and is the messenger to tell the player about regions which he/she has unlocked.

====Gadamon====
Fleria's rival. Very arrogant, and often shows up merely to antagonise the two of you. She is a breeder also, and so challenges you to fights every so often.

====Rip and Rap====
Two young sisters whom Fleria used to be friends with.  They have held a grudge against her for years about various types of food.

====Date====
A rich, spoiled, slightly arrogant man who offers to buy land from the player for 10,000 g.  Despite his arrogance, he does turn out to be a good man.

===Morx===

====Mitia====
A young breeder who considers the player and Fleria worthy rivals.  Despite her politeness, Fleria seems to dislike her.

====Mosha====
An experienced breeder who knows the area well.  She appears very elderly and has a somewhat romantic past with Bragma.  Her nephew is Taz.

====Taz====
A seemingly cocky yet decent young male breeder.  He is particularly fond of Beaklons, which causes problems for Fleria and the player.  He is Mosha's nephew.

====Yukiyo====
A very uncofident new female breeder whom Fleria dislikes, claiming that she makes her "tired."

===Kalaragi===

====Lek====
A laidback male breeder whom Fleria appears to like.  Despite his laidback nature, he gets very upset about losing.  He appears to have some sort of connection with Jimsey.

====Sansha====
Sansha is a young female breeder who uses the area used by the player as a fishing area.  She seems to pay more attention to fishing than to breeding.  Her monster names generally only have two letters (i.e. Mo).

====Jimsey====
A strange and sneaky boy who loves money.  At a point in the game, he steals from the player, but he turns out to be decent.

===Takrama===

====Haz====
A very serious male breeder who is very fond of Fleria.  He is pursuing a "bad monster trainer."  He was mentored by Lus.

====Shimuka====
A laidback yet feisty female breeder.  She, like Haz, is pursuing a "bad monster trainer," which makes her attack the player and Fleria, but she makes amends with them.

====Lus====
An old man and native of Takrama.  Haz's mentor.  He is originally thought to be the bad monster trainer, but the accusation is false.  He seems to like golems.

===Brillia===

====Maya====
A good-natured and generous young female breeder.  Taya's older sister.  Her family owns the land that the player uses to train.  She was attacked by the "modified monster."

====Taya====
Originally an extremely shy young boy, after battling with the player and Fleria, he becomes more outgoing.  He is Maya's younger brother.  He was attacked by the modified monster.

====Nahze====
A scientist in the field of monster modification.  He created a mysterious Zan monster, which causes people trouble.  He appears to be a bit naive.

===Goat===

====Burn====
Burn, also known as Lord Burn, is a somewhat arrogant yet decent breeder who has some connection with Jenna.

====Jenna====
An experienced breeder who was Fleria's mentor.  She appears protective of Fleria, though she is not afraid to start a fight.

====Kai====
A bad character who is connected to a "Joker" monster.  Jenna cautions against him, though Fleria doesn't listen.

====Dagga====
An unknown man who is strongly connected to the monster, Joker.  He is some kind of a friend to Kai.

==Adaptation and region==
Making up for the loss of the combination system is the ability of monsters to adapt to their surroundings. Though only one is available at the start of the game, the five different homes that you can raise your monster in represent five climates, each with its own training regimes, features, and food.

Morx, the first region you will train in, is a clearing in a [[forest]] centered around a gargantuan tree. The grassy area is covered with mushrooms, allowing the monster to train by interacting with the tree and the fungi.

Takrama, an oasis in the middle of a barren [[desert]], features rocky terrain, cacti, and dust storms with which to test your monster. It is noted that this is the harshest environment for monsters.

Brillia, a frozen [[tundra]], is filled with snow, seals, and icicles. A lone tree sits near the end of the area.

Kalaragi, a bright [[rainforest]], centers around a giant waterfall (known in-game as Umbagi, but rarely referred to by its name). A cliff path leads behind the waterfall Umbagi up to a ledge, and there is a giant lilypad accompanied by a similarly large [[Lotus (plant)|lotus]] flower. Crocodiles inhabit the water.  *Note: There is a bug in Kalaragi.  If you lose to Gadamon, Sansha will direct you to a place near the "Lord" Monster.  If you search the area, Fleria will direct you to another spot, and the storyline will halt.

Goat, the oddly named underwater sanctuary, allows you to raise your monster underwater. The waters of Goat are extremely high in [[oxygen]], explaining why and how you and your monsters have no trouble living under the sea.

Each monster is affiliated with one of these regions, and has subspecies corresponding to each climate and area. For instance, the Suezo - a monster normally inclined to Takrama – also has a subspecies for Goat, the sharklike Fukazo.

When a monster of one subspecies is raised in another area, after a time, they will mature. If they have been fed with enough of the regional food, they will adapt to their surroundings and change subspecies. For example, if a Morx Mocchi is raised in Brillia, and fed enough of Brillia's local food, the Mocchi will adapt to its surroundings, turning blue and white to blend in with its new home, and become a Brillian Mocchi.

Abubakar, who was 42 when appointed Emir, is the son of the 10th Emir of Agaie, Alhaji Abdullahi Bello Ubandoma.
He earned a Higher Diploma in Animal Health and Husbandry and a Postgraduate Diploma in Public Administration from [[Ahmadu Bello University]], [[Zaria]].&lt;ref name=tday19/&gt;
He is grand patron of the Nuhu Lafarma (Education) Foundation, which promotes improved education in the Agaie Emriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He is one of the promoters of formation of a new Edu State from parts of the current [[Niger State|Niger]] and [[Kwara State|Kwara]] states as a homeland for the [[Nupe people]], with capital at [[Bida, Nigeria|Bida]].
The movement is led by the [[Bida Emirate|Emir of Bida]], [[Abubakar Yahaya]], and is also supported by the [[Lapai Emirate|Etsu Lapai]], [[Umar Baogo III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In January 2010 Abubakar conferred the honorary title of "Badakoshin Agaie" on the Niger State governor [[Muazu Babangida Aliyu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In July 2010 he was attacked in Agaie by an angry mob who accused him of siding with the police after local people had tried to prevent police from pursuing suspected criminals. In the ensuing violence one person was killed, and later the mob carried his body to the Etsu's palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Prior to his death, Uemura had apparently been refusing to commit crimes for a group of older boys with whom he spent time, and wanted to cut ties with them.

Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe]] expressed his condolences to the victim's family and vowed that Japan should not have another similar tragedy.

'''Offences Against the Person Act''' (with its variations) is a stock [[short title]] used for legislation in the [[United Kingdom]], in the [[Republic of Ireland]], in [[Hong Kong]], in [[New Zealand]], in [[Tasmania]] and in [[Antigua and Barbuda]], relating to [[offences against the person]]. It seems to have been derived from the [[long title]] of the Act which has come to be known as the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1828]]. It is sometimes abbreviated to '''OAPA''', as in "OAPA 1861".

The Bill for an Act with this short title will have been known as a '''Offences Against the Person Bill''' during its passage through Parliament.

"Offences Against the Person Acts" may be a generic name either for legislation bearing that short title or for all legislation which relates to offences against the person. It is not a term of art.

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Everett C. Olson]] noted{{When|date=April 2012}} that there was a hiatus and a sudden change in between the early Permian and middle/late Permian faunas. Since then this event has been realized across many groups, including plants, marine invertebrates, and tetrapods.

== Identification ==
The first evidence of extinction came when [[Everett C. Olson]] noted a hiatus between early Permian faunas dominated by [[pelycosaurs]] and [[therapsid]] dominated faunas of the middle and late Permian. First considered to be a preservational gap in the fossil record, the event was originally dubbed 'Olson's Gap'.&lt;ref name=LSG04&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of Olson's Extinction amplified the effects of the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] and the final extinction killed off only about 80% of species alive at that time while the other losses occurred during the first pulse or the interval between pulses.

During the 1990s and 2000s researchers gathered evidence on the biodiversity of plants, marine organism and tetrapods that indicated an extinction pulse preceding the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] had a profound impact on life on land. On land Sahney and Benton showed that even discounting the sparse fossil assemblages from the extinction period, the event can be confirmed by the stages of time bracketing the event since well preserved sections of the fossil record from both before and after the event have been found and they referred to the event as 'Olson's Extinction'.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction" /&gt; The 'Gap' was finally closed in 2012 when Michael Benton confirmed that the terrestrial fossil record of the Middle Permian is well represented by fossil localities in the American southwest and European Russia and that the gap is not an artifact of a poor rock record since there is no correlation between geological and biological records of the Middle Permian.&lt;ref name=MJB2012A&gt;

Despite the closure of Olson's Gap, the presence of an extinction event at the Kungurian/Roadian boundary was still disputed. It was argued that the observed decrease in diversity might be due to the shift in the location of greatest sample size from the palaeo-equatorial to the palaeo-temperate regions: equatorial regions tend to have a higher diversity in most modern groups.&lt;ref name=Benson2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benson|first1=R.|last2=Upchurch|first2=P.|title=Diversity trends in the establishment of terrestrial vertebrate ecosystems:Interactions between spatial and temporal sampling biases|journal=Geology|date=2013|volume=41|pages=43–46|doi=10.1130/g33543.1|bibcode=2013Geo....41...43B}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a thorough review of the tetrapod-bearing formations during the Kungurian and the Roadian found evidence that the faunal turnover at this time is not a result of the shift in sampling locality; the early Permian temperate faunas are more similar to the early Permian equatorial faunas than the middle Permian temperate faunas.&lt;ref name=Brocklehurst2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brocklehurst|first1=N.|last2=Day|first2=M.|last3=Rubidge|first3=B.|last4=Frobisch|first4=F.|title=Olson's Extinction and the Latitudinal Biodiversity Gradient|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B|date=2017|volume=284|pages=20170231|doi=10.1098/rspb.2017.0231}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also shown that throughout the Permian, the highest diversity was found in temperate regions rather the equatorial, and therefore the fall in diversity could not be due to increased sampling of temperate latitudes.&lt;ref name=Brocklehurst2017/&gt;

== Possible causes ==
There is no widely accepted theory for the cause of Olson's Extinction. Recent research has indicated that climate change may be a possible cause. Extreme environments were observed from the Permian of Kansas which resulted from a combination of hot climate and acidic waters particularly coincident with Olson’s Extinction.&lt;ref name=ZAMBITO2013&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether this climate change was a result of Earth's natural processes or exacerbated by another event is unknown.

== Extinction patterns ==

=== On land ===

====Plants====
Plants showed large turnover in the mid-to-late Permian and into the Triassic. The duration of higher extinction rates (&gt;60%) in land plants was about 23.4 Myr, starting from Olson's Extinction and into the early Middle Triassic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xiong|first1=C.|last2=Wang|first2=Q.|title=Permian–Triassic land-plant diversity in South China: Was there a mass extinction at the Permian/Triassic boundary?|journal=Paleobiology|date=2011|volume=37|issue=1|pages=157–167|doi=10.1666/09029.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Olson's Extinction represents the third highest peak of extinction rates seen in plants throughout the Paleozoic, and the number of genera fell by 25%.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The extinction was particularly severe among free-sporing plants; seed plants seem to have been largely unaffected.&lt;ref name=CascalesMinana2015/&gt;

====Tetrapods====
The Permian was a time of rapid change for tetrapods; in particular there was a major changeover from faunas dominated by basal synapsids ("[[pelycosaurs]]”) and reptiliomorphs ([[Diadectes]]) to faunas dominated by [[therapsid]]s ([[Dinocephalia]], [[Anomodontia]], [[Gorgonopsia]], and [[Cynodontia]]) some of which were direct ancestors of mammals.&lt;ref name="MJB2012A" /&gt; In 2008 Sahney and Benton&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction" /&gt;  confirmed that this was not just a turnover (gradual replacement of one faunal complex by another) but a real extinction event in which a significant drop in the biodiversity of tetrapods on a global scale and community level occurred. The extinction appears to have taken place in two phases: [[Edaphosauridae]] and [[Ophiacodontidae]] died out across the Kungurian/Roadian boundary, while Caseidae and Therapsida diversified; later in the Roadian [[Sphenacodontidae]] died out and Caseidae went into decline.&lt;ref name=Brocklehurst2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brocklehurst|first1=N.|last2=Kammerer|first2=C.

In December 2011, the fossilized remains of the 'youngest' pelycosaur was described by Modesto et al. as from 260 million years ago in South Africa, the first evidence that one of these animals survived Olson’s Extinction.&lt;ref name=Modesto2011&gt;

=== In the water ===

====Fish====
Extinction rates in fish increased noticeably between the Cisuralian and the Guadalupian, the time of Olson's extinction.&lt;ref name=Friedman2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=M.|last2=Sallan|first2=L.|title=FIVE HUNDRED MILLION YEARS OF EXTINCTION AND RECOVERY: A PHANEROZOIC SURVEY OF LARGE-SCALE DIVERSITY PATTERNS IN FISHES|journal=Palaeontology|date=2012|volume=55|pages=707–742|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4983.2012.01165.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, origination rates also rose, and so there does not appear to have been any substantial decrease in species richness&lt;ref name=Friedman2012/&gt;

==Recovery==
Fauna did not recover fully from Olson's Extinction before the impact of the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]]. Estimates of recovery time vary, where some authors indicated recovery was prolonged, lasting 30 million years into the Triassic.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction" /&gt;

Several important events took place during Olson's Extinction, most notably the origin of [[therapsida|therapsids]], a group that includes the evolutionary ancestors of mammals. Further research on the recently identified primitive therapsid of the Xidagou Formation (Dashankou locality) in China of Roadian age may provide more information on this topic.&lt;ref name="Liu-Rubidge-Li-2009"&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv|last1=Liu|first1=J.|last2=Rubidge|first2=B|last3=Li|first3=J.|title=New basal synapsid supports Laurasian origin for therapsids|journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica|year=2009|volume=54|issue=3|pages=393–400|url=http://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app54/app20080071.pdf|doi=10.4202/app.2008.0071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Public Vault''' at the [[Congressional Cemetery]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] is an early classical revival structure built 1832–34 with funds appropriated by the [[United States Congress]] to store the bodies of government officials and members of the public before burial. About 4,600 individuals were temporarily interred in the vault, including three U.S. presidents, First Lady [[Dolley Madison]], and sixteen congressmen who died while serving in office.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson and Johnson, pp. 67, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A partial list of occupants of the vault is available on the lower part of the page at [http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/site-public-vault "Site - Public Vault"], published by the Association for the Preservation of the Historic Congressional Cemetery.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a contributing structure to the cemetery, the vault was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on June 23, 1969, and a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places listings for June 24, 2011|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20110624.htm|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|date=June 24, 2011|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
Congress approved an expenditure of $1,000 on July 14, 1832, to build "a substantial brick or stone vault in the Washington Parish Burial Ground, for the temporary interment of members of Congress." Additional appropriations of $1,600 on March 2, 1833, and $194 on June 30, 1834, were approved to complete the vault.  These two bills included the name "Public Vault" and allowed the use by members of the public. Use by the government was allowed without further payment, and members of the public were to be charged $5.00 per temporary use.  The sexton of [[Christ Church, Washington Parish|Christ Church]] was to be given $1.50 of this sum for his services, with the remainder given to the vestry of Christ Church, which owns the burial ground, "to be expended in the improvement of the grounds and in keeping the same in order."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson and Johnson, pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[John C. Calhoun]] was interred in the Public Vault following a formal funeral and grand procession from the Capitol on April 2, 1850.

Several grand public or state funeral processions ended in front of the Public Vault, after starting at the White House or the Capitol and then moving down Pennsylvania Avenue and E Street SE to the cemetery. These included the funerals for Presidents Harrison, J. Q. Adams, and Taylor; Senator Calhoun; First Ladies Dolley Madison and Louisa Adams; the victims of the USS Princeton disaster; and several other congressmen.&lt;ref name="Chapter 2"&gt;Johnson and Johnson, Chapter 2, "The Grand Procession to the National Burial Ground."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/president-william-henry-harrison President William Henry Harrison] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012172257/http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/president-william-henry-harrison |date=2014-10-12 }}, reprinted from The [[National Intelligencer]] by the Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery, accessed April 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/president-john-quincy-adams President John Quincy Adams] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009093956/http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/president-john-quincy-adams |date=2013-10-09 }} includes reprints from 1848 editions of the National Intelligencer, Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery, accessed April 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/president-zachary-taylor President Zachary Taylor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011091659/http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/president-zachary-taylor |date=2013-10-11 }} includes reprints from 1850 editions of the National Intelligencer, Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery, accessed April 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these processions were two miles long, led by military bands and troops for the funerals of military men, members of both houses of congress and the administration, and pall bearers carefully chosen for political balance to symbolize unity and stability in government.&lt;ref name="Chapter 2"/&gt;

John Quincy Adams rode in a carriage in the funeral procession for President Harrison and wrote in his diary, "the corpse was deposited in the receiving vault  - with some difficulty from the excessive crowd, but not the slightest disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Diary entry for April 7, 1841, quoted by Johnson and Johnson, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

South Carolina Congressman [[Preston Smith Brooks]] lay in the Public Vault in January 1857, within a year of brutally beating Senator [[Charles Sumner]] with a cane on the floor of the Senate, an attack that is viewed as an omen of the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/10/30/fox-news-strolls-congressional-cemetery/ Congressional Cemetery Offers History Lesson], James Rosen, Fox News, October 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legend says that [[Lewis Powell (conspirator)|Lewis Powell]] spent a night in the vault while avoiding pursuit for his role in the assassination of President Lincoln.&lt;ref name="Washian"/&gt;

While the Public Vault was an important, if semi-official, national memorial during its first few decades, it was used less and less during the second half of the nineteenth century and during much of the twentieth century was unused.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson and Johnson, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; During the twentieth century, it became unclear whether the U.S. Government or Christ Church owned the Public Vault and several dozen burial lots.  In 1953 a Congressional report suggested that the government clear the record by selling the otherwise unnamed "receiving vault" and the burial lots to the church for $100.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson and Johnson, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 2003 the vault was "empty and decaying."  It has since been restored with funds provided by the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson and Johnson, pp. 346–347.&lt;/ref&gt; During a c. 2010 Prohibition-based fundraiser, it was used as a cocktail bar.&lt;ref name="PV"/&gt;

'''Respirocytes''' are hypothetical, microscopic, [[Artificial cell|artificial]] [[red blood cell]]s that are intended to emulate the function of their organic counterparts, so as to supplement or replace the function of much of the human body's normal [[respiratory system]]. Respirocytes were proposed by [[Robert A. Freitas Jr]] in his 1998 paper "A Mechanical Artificial Red Blood Cell: Exploratory Design in Medical Nanotechnology".&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robert A. Freitas Jr.|title=Exploratory Design in Medical Nanotechnology: A Mechanical Artificial Red Cell|journal=Artificial Cells, Blood Substitutes, and Immobil. Biotech.|number=26|year=1998|pages=411–430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Respirocytes are an example of [[molecular nanotechnology]], a field of technology still in the very earliest, purely hypothetical phase of development. Current technology is not sufficient to build a respirocyte due to considerations of power, atomic-scale manipulation, immune reaction or [[toxicity]], [[computation]] and [[communication]].

== Structure of a respirocyte ==

Freitas proposed a spherical robot made up of 18 billion atoms arranged as a tiny [[pressure tank]], which would be filled up with [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name =REF1&gt;{{cite web|title=RESPIROCYTES – IMPROVING UPON NATURE'S DESIGN: BREATHE EASY WITH RESPIROCYTES|url=http://www.thenanoage.com/respirocytes.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2017}} 

[[File:Respirocyte.jpg|thumb|Hypothesised structure of a respirocyte]]

==Uses==
In Freitas' proposal, each respirocyte could store and transport 236 times more oxygen than a natural red blood cell, and could release it in a more controlled manner.

[[Ray Kurzweil]] hypothesised that such respirocytes would allow an adult human to [[Sprint (running)|sprint]] at top speed for at least 15 minutes without taking a breath.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/07/15/bio.tech/index.html|title=Scientists: Humans and machines will merge in future|last=Farrar|first=Lara|date=15 July 2008|website=CNN|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{SCIRS|date=June 2017}}{{Medical citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Freitas has also proposed "[[microbivore]]" robots that would attack [[pathogens]] in the manner of [[white blood cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kurzweil | first = Ray | authorlink = Ray Kurzweil | coauthors = | title = The Singularity Is Near | publisher = | date = | location = | pages = 254 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SERVQUAL''' is a multi-dimensional research instrument, designed to capture consumer expectations and perceptions of a service along the five dimensions that are believed to represent service quality. SERVQUAL is built on the expectancy-disconfirmation paradigm, which in simple terms means that service quality is understood as the extent to which consumers' pre-consumption expectations of quality are confirmed or disconfirmed by their actual perceptions of the service experience. When the SERVQUAL questionnaire was first published in 1988 by a team of academic researchers, [[A. Parasuraman]], [[Valarie Zeithaml]] and [[Leonard Berry (professor)|Leonard L. Berry]]  to measure quality in the service sector,&lt;ref&gt;Parasuraman, A, Ziethaml, V. and Berry, L.L., "SERVQUAL: A Multiple- Item Scale for Measuring Consumer Perceptions of Service Quality' ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vo. 62,  no. 1, 1988, pp 12-40 &lt;online:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225083802_SERVQUAL_A_multiple-_Item_Scale_for_measuring_consumer_perceptions_of_service_quality&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; it represented a breakthrough in the measurement methods used for service quality research. The diagnostic value of the instrument is supported by the ''model of service quality'' which forms the conceptual framework for the development of the scale (i.e. instrument or questionnaire). The instrument has been widely applied in a variety of contexts and cultural settings and found to be relatively robust. It has become the dominant measurement scale in the area of service quality. In spite of the long-standing interest in SERVQUAL and its myriad of context-specific applications, it has attracted some criticism from researchers.

==The SERVQUAL instrument==

[[File:Measuring service quality using SERVQUAL model (Kumar et al, 2009).png|thumb|The five dimensions of service quality)]]

SERVQUAL is a multidimensional research instrument (i.e. questionnaire or measurement scale) designed to measure service quality by capturing respondents’ expectations and perceptions along the five dimensions of service quality.&lt;ref&gt;Parasuraman, A., Berry, L.L. and Zeithaml, V.A.,  “Refinement and Reassessment of the SERVQUAL scale,” ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol. 67, no. 4, 1991, pp 57-67&lt;/ref&gt;  The questionnaire consists of matched pairs of items; 22 expectation items and 22 perceptions items, organised into five dimensions which are believed to  align with the consumer’s mental map of service quality dimensions. Both the expectations component and the perceptions component of the questionnaire consist a total of 22 items, comprising 4 items to capture tangibles, 5 items to capture reliability, 4 items for responsiveness, 4 items for assurance and 5 items to capture empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Parasuraman, A, Ziethaml, V. and Berry, L.L., "SERVQUAL: A Multiple- Item Scale for Measuring Consumer Perceptions of Service Quality' ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol. 62,  no. 1, 1988, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The questionnaire is designed to be administered in a face-to-face interview and requires a moderate to large size sample for statistical reliability. In practice, it is customary to add additional items such as the respondent's demographics, prior experience with the brand or category and behavioural intentions (intention to revisit/ repurchase, loyalty intentions and propensity to give word-of-mouth referrals). Thus, the final questionnaire may consist of 60+ items and typically takes at least one hour, per respondent, to administer. The length of the questionnaire combined with sample size requirements contribute to substantial costs in administration and data analysis.

The instrument which was developed over a five year period; was tested, pre-tested and refined before appearing in its final form. The instrument's developers, Parasuman, Ziethaml and Berry, claim that it is a highly reliable and valid instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Zeithaml, V., Parasuraman, A. and Berry, L.L., ''Delivering Service Quality: Balancing Customer Perceptions and Expectations,'' N.Y., The Free Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, it has been widely used and adapted in service quality research for numerous industries and various geographic regions. In application, many researchers are forced to make minor modifications to the instrument as necessary for context-specific applications. Some researchers label their revised instruments with innovative titles such as EDUQUAL (educational context),&lt;ref&gt;Mahapatra, S.S. and Khan, M.S., "A Methodology for Evalution of Service Quality Using Neural Networks," in ''Proceedings of the International Conference on Global Manufacturing and Innovation,' July 27–29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; HEALTHQUAL (hospital context) &lt;ref&gt;Lee, D., "HEALTHQUAL: a multi-item scale for assessing healthcare service quality," Service Business, 2016; pp 1-26, doi:10.1007/s11628-016-0317-2&lt;/ref&gt; and ARTSQUAL (art museum).&lt;ref&gt;Higgs, B., Polonsky M.J. and Hollick, M., “Measuring Expectations: Pre and Post Consumption: Does It Matter?” ''Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services'', vol. 12, no. 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The SERVQUAL questionnaire has been described as "the most popular standardized questionnaire to measure service quality." &lt;ref&gt;Caruanaa, A., Ewing, M.T and Ramaseshanc, B., "Assessment of the Three-Column Format SERVQUAL: An Experimental Approach," ''Journal of Business Research,'' Vol. 49, no. 1, July 2000, pp 57–65&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely used by service firms, most often in conjunction with other measures of service quality and customer satisfaction. The SERVQUAL instrument was developed as part of a broader conceptualisation of how customers understand service quality. This conceptualisation is known as the ''model of service quality'' or more popularly as the ''gaps model.''

==The model of service quality==

The model of service quality, popularly known as the ''gaps model'' was developed by a group of American authors, [[A. Parasuraman]], [[Valarie Zeithaml|Valarie A. Zeithaml]] and [[Leonard Berry (professor)|Len Berry]], in a systematic research program carried out between 1983 and 1988. The model identifies the principal dimensions (or components) of service quality; proposes a scale for measuring service quality (SERVQUAL) and suggests possible causes of service quality problems. The model's developers originally identified [[SERVQUAL#Determinants|ten dimensions of service quality]], but after testing and retesting, some of the dimensions were found to be autocorrelated and the total number of dimensions was reduced to five, namely - reliability, assurance, tangibles, empathy and responsiveness.  These five dimensions are thought to represent the dimensions of service quality across a range of industries and settings. &lt;ref&gt;Zeithaml, V.A., Berry, L.L. and Parasuraman, A., "Communication and Control Processes in the Delivery of Service Quality," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 52, No. 2, 1988, pp. 35-48 &lt;/ref&gt; Among students of marketing, the mnemonic,  '''RATER''', an acronym formed from the first letter of each of the five dimensions is often used as an aid to recall.

[[File:Servqual.jpg|thumb|A simplified model of service quality]]

Businesses use the SERVQUAL instrument (i.e. questionnaire) to measure potential service quality problems and the model of service quality to help diagnose possible causes of the problem. The model of service quality is built on the ''expectancy-confirmation paradigm'' which suggests that consumers perceive quality in terms of their perceptions of how well a given service delivery meets their expectations of that delivery.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, R.L., Balakrishnan, P.V. S. and Barry, B., "Outcome Satisfaction in Negotiation: A Test of Expectancy Disconfirmation," ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,'' Vol. 60, no. 2, 1994, Pages 252-275&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, service quality can be conceptualised as a simple equation:

'''SQ = P- E'''
: where;

: '''SQ''' is service quality
: '''P''' is the individual's perceptions of given service delivery
: '''E''' is the individual's expectations of a given service delivery

When customer expectations are greater than their perceptions of received delivery, service quality is deemed low. When perceptions exceed expectations then service quality is high. The model of service quality identifies five gaps that may cause customers to experience poor service quality. In this model, gap 5 is the service quality gap and is the ''only'' gap that can be directly measured. In other words, the SERVQUAL instrument was specifically designed to capture gap 5. In contrast, Gaps 1-4 cannot be measured, but have diagnostic value.

== Development of the model ==

The development of the model of service quality involved a systematic research undertaking which began in 1983, and after various refinements, resulted in the publication of the SERVQUAL instrument in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Parasuraman, A., Berry, L.L.,  Zeithaml, V. A., "Understanding Customer Expectations of Service," ''Sloan Management Review,'' Vol. 32, no. 3, 1991, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; The model's developers began with an exhaustive literature search in order to identify items that were believed to impact on perceived service quality. This initial search identified some 100 items which were used in the first rounds of consumer testing. Preliminary data analysis, using a data reduction technique known as [[factor analysis]] (also known as [[principal components analysis]]) revealed that these items loaded onto ten dimensions (or components) of service quality. The initial ten dimensions that were believed to represent service quality were:

# '''[[competence (human resources)|Competence]]''' is the possession of the required skills and knowledge to perform the service. For example, there may be competence in the knowledge and skill of contact personnel, knowledge and skill of operational support personnel and research capabilities of the organization.
# '''Courtesy''' is the consideration for the customer's property and a clean and neat appearance of contact personnel, manifesting as politeness, respect, and friendliness.
# '''Credibility''' includes factors such as trustworthiness, belief and honesty. It involves having the customer's best interests at prime position. It may be influenced by company name, company reputation and the personal characteristics of the contact personnel.
# '''Security''' enables the customer to feel free from danger, risk or doubt including physical safety, financial security and confidentiality.
# '''Access''' is approachability and ease of contact. For example, convenient office operation hours and locations.
# '''Communication''' means both informing customers in a language they are able to understand and also listening to customers. A company may need to adjust its language for the varying needs of its customers. Information might include for example, explanation of the service and its cost, the relationship between services and costs and assurances as to the way any problems are effectively managed.
# '''Knowing the customer''' means making an effort to understand the customer's individual needs, providing individualized attention, recognizing the customer when they arrive and so on. This in turn helps to delight the customers by rising above their expectations. 
# '''Tangibles''' are the physical evidence of the service, for instance, the  appearance of the physical facilities, tools and equipment used to provide the service; the appearance of personnel and communication materials and the presence of other customers in the service facility.
# '''Reliability'''  is the ability to perform the promised service in a dependable and accurate manner. The service is performed correctly on the first occasion, the accounting is correct, records are up to date and schedules are kept.
# '''Responsiveness''' is the readiness and willingness of employees to help customers by providing prompt timely services, for example, mailing a transaction slip immediately or setting up appointments quickly.

Further testing suggested that some of the ten preliminary dimensions of service quality were closely related or autocorrelated. Thus the ten initial dimensions were reduced and the labels amended to accurately reflect the revised dimensions. By the early 1990s, the authors had refined the model to five factors which in testing, appear to be relatively stable and robust.

# '''Reliability:''' the ability to perform the promised service dependably and accurately
# '''Assurance:''' the knowledge and courtesy of employees and their ability to convey trust and confidence
# '''Tangibles:''' the appearance of physical facilities, equipment, personnel and communication materials
# '''Empathy:''' the provision of caring, individualized attention to customers
# '''Responsiveness:''' the willingness to help customers and to provide prompt service

These are the five dimensions of service quality that form the basis of the individual items in the SERVQUAL research instrument (questionnaire). The acronym RATER, is often used to help students of marketing remember the five dimensions of quality explicitly mentioned in the research instrument. It is these five dimensions that are believed to represent the consumer's mental checklist of service quality. 

Nyeck, Morales, Ladhari, and Pons (2002) stated the SERVQUAL measuring tool “appears to remain the most complete attempt to conceptualize and measure service quality” (p.&amp;nbsp;101). The SERVQUAL measuring tool has been used by many researchers across a wide range of service industries and contexts, such as healthcare, banking, financial services, and education (Nyeck, Morales, Ladhari, &amp; Pons, 2002).

== Criticisms of SERVQUAL and the model of service quality ==

Although the SERVQUAL instrument has been widely applied in a variety of industry and cross-cultural contexts, there are many criticisms of the approach. Francis Buttle published one of the most comprehensive criticisms of the model of service quality and the associated SERVQUAL instrument in 1996 in which both operational and theoretical concerns were identified.&lt;ref&gt;Buttle, F., “SERVQUAL: Review, Critique, Research Agenda,"  ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 30, no.  1, pp. 8-32 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more important criticisms include:

: ''Face validity'': The model of service quality has its roots in the expectancy-disconfimation paradigm that informs customer satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, R.L., ''Satisfaction: A Behavioural Perspective on the Consumer,'' Boston, MA, Irwin McGraw-Hill, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; A number of researchers have argued that the research instrument actually captures ''satisfaction'' rather than ''service quality''.&lt;ref&gt;Souca, Ma. L., "SERVQUAL - Thirty years of research on service quality with implications for customer satisfaction," in ''Marketing - from Information to Decision,'' [Proceedings of the International Conference], Cluj-Napoca: Babes Bolyai University, 2011, pp 420 -429&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have questioned the validity of conceptualising service quality as a gap.&lt;ref&gt;van Dyke, T.P.,   Kappelman, L.A. and Prybutok, V.R.,"Measuring Information Systems Service Quality: Concerns on the Use of the SERVQUAL Questionnaire," ''MIS Quarterly,'' Vol. 21, No. 2, 1997, pp. 195-208, &lt;Online:  https://www.jstor.org/stable/249419&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''Construct validity'': The model's developers tested and retested the SERVQUAL scale for reliability and validity. However, at the same time, the model's developers recommended that applied use of the instrument should modify or adapt them for specific contexts. Any attempt to adapt or modify the scale will have implications for the validity of items with implications for the validity of the dimensions of reliability, assurance, tangibles, empathy and responsiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A.M., "Measuring Service Quality: Is SERVQUAL now redundant?  ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' [Special Issue: Marketing in the Services Sector],  Vol 11, no. 1, 1995, pp 257-276&lt;/ref&gt;
 
: ''Ambiguity of expectations construct'': SERVQUAL is designed to be administered after respondents have experienced a service. They are therefore asked to ''recall'' their pre-experience expectations. However,  recall is not always accurate, raising concerns about whether the research design accurately captures true pre-consumption expectations. In addition, studies show that expectations actually change over time. Consumers are continually modifying their expectations as they gain experience with a product category or brand.&lt;ref&gt;Parasuraman, A.; Berry, Leonard L.; Zeithaml, Valarie A., "Understanding Customer Expectations of Service," ''Sloan Management Review,'' Vol. 32, no. 3, 1991, pp 39 - 48&lt;/ref&gt; In light of these insights, concerns have been raised about whether the act of experiencing the service might colour respondents' expectations.

: ''Operational definition of the expectations construct'': The way that expectations has been operationalised also represents a concern for theorists investigating the validity of the gaps model. The literature identifies different types of expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Parasuraman, A., Zeithaml, V. A., Berry, L. L., "Reassessment of Expectations as a Comparison Standard in Measuring Service Quality: Implications for Further Research," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 58 January 1994, pp 111–124&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, there is an argument that only ''forecast expectations'' are true expectations. Yet, the SERVQUAL instrument appears to elicit ''ideal expectations''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, C. and Mathews, B.P., "The influence of experience on service expectations", ''International Journal of Service Industry Management,'' Vol. 8 no. 4, pp 290-305&lt;/ref&gt;  Note the wording in the questionnaire in the preceding figure which grounds respondents in their expectations of what ''excellent'' companies will do. Subtle use of words can elicit different types of expectations.  Capturing true expectations is important because it has implications for service quality scores. When researchers elicit ideal expectations, overall service quality scores are likely to be lower, making it much more difficult for marketers to deliver on those expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Boulding, W., Kalra, A., Staelin, R. and Zeithaml, V. A., "Dynamic Process Model of Service Quality: From Expectations to Behavioral Intentions," ''Journal of Marketing Research,'' Vol. 30, no 1, 1993, pp 7-27&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Questionnaire length:''  The matched pairs design of the questionnaire (total of 22 expectation items plus 22 perception items= 44 total items) makes for a very long questionnaire. If researchers add demographic and other behavioural items such as prior experience with product or category and the standard battery of demographics including: age, gender, occupation, educational attainment etc. then the average questionnaire will have around 60 items. In practical terms, this means that the questionnaire would take more than one hour per respondent to administer in a face-to-face interview. Lengthy questionnaires are known to induce ''respondent fatigue'' which may have potential implications for data reliability. In addition, lengthy questionnaires add to the time and cost involved in data collection and data analysis. Coding, collation and interpretation of data is very time consuming and in the case of lengthy questionnaires administered across large samples, the findings cannot be used to address urgent quality-related problems. In some cases, it may be necessary to carry out 'quick and dirty' research while waiting for the findings of studies with superior research design.

: ''Administration of the questionnaire'': Some analysts have pointed out that the SERVPERF instrument, developed by Cronin and Taylor,&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, J. J. and Taylor, S. A., "Measuring Service Quality: A Re-examination and Extension," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 56, no. 3, 1992, pp 55-68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cronin J.J., Steven, J. and Taylor, A., "SERVPERF versus SERVQUAL: Reconciling performance based  and  perceptions-minus-expectations  measurement  of  service  quality," ''Journal  of  Marketing,''  Vol.  58, January, 1994, pp. 125-131&lt;/ref&gt; and which reduced the number of questionnaire items by half (22 perceptions items only), achieves results that correlate well with SERVQUAL, with no reduction in diagnostic power, improved data accuracy through reductions in respondent boredom and fatigue and savings in the form of reduced administration costs.

:''Dimensional instability'':  A number of studies have reported that the five dimensions of service quality implicit in the model (reliability, assurance, tangibles, empathy and responsiveness) do not hold up when the research is replicated in different countries, different industries, in different market segments or even at different time periods.&lt;ref&gt;Carman, J.M., "Consumer Perceptions of Service Quality: An assessment of the SERVQUAL dimensions," ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol. 66, no 1, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lam, S. K and Woo, K. S.,  "Measuring Service Quality: A test-retest reliability investigation of SERVQUAL,"  ''Journal of the Market Research Society, '' Vol. 39, no. 2, 1997, pp 381-396&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies report that the SERVQUAL items do not always load onto the same factors. In some empirical research, the items load onto fewer dimensions, while other studies report that the items load onto more than five dimensions of quality. In statistical terms, the robustness of the factor loadings is known as a model's ''dimensional stability.'' Across a wide range of empirical studies, the factors implicit in the SERVQUAL instrument have been shown to be unstable.&lt;ref&gt;Niedricha, R.W., Kiryanovab, E. and Black, W.C., "The Dimensional Stability of the Standards used in the Disconfirmation Paradigm," ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol. 81, no. 1, 2005, pp 49–57&lt;/ref&gt; Problems associated  with  the stability of the factor loadings may be attributed, at least in part, to the  requirement  that  each  new  SERVQUAL  investigation needed  to  make  context-sensitive  modifications to  the  instrument  in  order  to  accommodate the  unique  aspects  of  the focal service setting or problem. However, it has also been hypothesised that the dimensions of service quality represented by the SERVQUAL research instrument fail to capture the true dimensionality of the service quality construct and that there may not be a universal set of service quality dimensions that are relevant across all service industries.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, R.E., Hardgrave, B.C. and Jones, R.W., "SERVQUAL Dimensionality: An investigation of presentation order effect," ''International Journal of Services and Standards,'' Vol. 7, no. 1 DOI: 10.1504/IJSS.2011.040639&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of these criticisms, the SERVQUAL instrument, or any one of its variants (i.e. modified forms), dominates current research into service quality.&lt;ref&gt;Ladhari, R., "A review of twenty years of SERVQUAL research", ''International Journal of Quality and Service Sciences,'' Vol. 1 no. 2, pp.172 - 198&lt;/ref&gt;  In a review of more than 40 articles that made use of SERVQUAL, a team of researchers found that  “few researchers concern themselves with the validation of the measuring tool”.&lt;ref&gt;Nyeck, S., Morales, M., Ladhari, R., &amp; Pons, F., "10 Years of Service Quality  Measurement: Reviewing the use of the SERVQUAL Instrument," ''Cuadernos de Difusion,'' Vol. 7, no 13, pp 101-107.&lt;/ref&gt;  SERVQUAL is not only the subject of academic papers, but it is also widely used by industry practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Asubonteng, P., McCleary, K.J. and Swan, J.E.,  "SERVQUAL revisited: a critical review of service quality", ''Journal of Services Marketing,'' Vol. 10, no 6, 1996, pp 62-81&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sparkie Williams''' (1954–1962) was a [[talking bird|talking]] [[Budgerigar|budgie]] who provided the inspiration for a new [[opera]] by [[Michael Nyman]] and [[Carsten Nicolai]]. The opera was performed in [[Berlin]] in March 2009.&lt;ref name="Berlin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/tyne/7963007.stm|accessdate=2009-03-25 |author=BBC website|title=Linguistic budgie inspires opera| date=2009-03-25 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sparkie had a repertoire of more than 500 words and eight [[nursery rhymes]], becoming a national celebrity after fronting an advertising campaign for Capern’s bird seed, and making a record which sold 20,000 copies.&lt;ref name="Celebrity"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4386929,00.html|accessdate=2009-03-25 |author= David Alderton - Guardian newspaper|title=Talk the squawk| work=The Guardian | location=London | date=2002-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CD star"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/4839366.stm|accessdate=2009-03-25 |author= BBC website|title=Tongue-twisting budgie is CD star| date=2006-03-23 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he died, he was stuffed and put on show at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]’s [[Hancock Museum]].&lt;ref name="Museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.thisisthenortheast.co.uk/2002/12/3/112483.html|accessdate=2009-03-25 |author= Northern Echo newspaper|title=Straight from the budgie's beak |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Hatched and bred in [[North East England]], Sparkie was owned by Mrs. Mattie Williams, who lived in [[Forest Hall]], near [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]]. He earned his name after Mrs Williams called him ‘A bright little spark,' and she taught him to speak, recite songs and sing nursery rhymes. Sparkie had a huge repertoire of words and sayings. By the time he was three-and-a-half, he had won the [[BBC]] International Cage Word Contest in July 1958. He was so good, in fact, that he was disqualified from taking part again.&lt;ref name="Sparkie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journallive.co.uk/videos-pictures-north-east/pictures-north-east/2009/03/26/sparkie-williams-part-2-61634-23237579/|accessdate=2009-03-25 |author=The Journal newspaper|title=Sparkie Williams Part 2|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sparkie was courted by bird seed sellers and fronted the advertisement campaign for Capern’s bird seed for two years. He was recorded talking with budgie expert Philip Marsden on BBC radio, and appeared on the BBC Tonight programme with [[Cliff Michelmore]]. When Sparkie died, he was stuffed by the best [[taxidermist]] in London and taken on a tour of Britain in an exhibition of his life and work, before coming back to the Hancock Museum in 1996.&lt;ref name="Celebrity"/&gt; Sparkie Williams is acclaimed as the world’s most outstanding talking bird in the [[Guinness Book of Records]].

He is now part of the collections owned by the [[Natural History Society of Northumbria]].

==Opera==
The new opera inspired by Sparkie is based on Michael Nyman’s 1977 piece ''Pretty Talk''. The original piece used material from a record made by Capern’s bird-food company to help customers teach their pet birds to talk. The 7-inch flexi disc played short sentences spoken by Sparkie’s owner, Mrs Williams, to encourage her pet to speak - followed by replies from Sparkie himself.&lt;ref name="Library"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/listentonature/specialinterestlang/langofbirds13.html|accessdate=2009-03-25 |author=The British Library|title=The language of birds: 5.1 Talking birds|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new opera, ''Sparkie: Cage and Beyond'', features further recordings from the ‘Sparkie’ archives of the Natural History Society of Northumbria. A CD of Sparkie talking has already been released.&lt;ref name="Topbill"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article743882.ece|accessdate=2009-03-25 |author1=Jack Malvern |author2=Arts Reporter |author3=Times newspaper |title=Budgie tops the bill as mimicry is put on CD| work=The Times | location=London | date=2006-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dailymail"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-380733/Storytelling-budgie-stars-new-CD.html|accessdate=2009-03-25 |author= Daily Mail newspaper |title=Storytelling budgie stars on new CD|location=London|date=2006-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On display==
Work on a £26&amp;nbsp;million extension and refurbishing of the Hancock Museum in Newcastle was completed in May 2009 and it has now re-opened as part of the [[Great North Museum]]. Sparkie is among the exhibits on show to visitors.&lt;ref name="Berlin"/&gt;

[[File:KurtCobainHouse.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Kurt Cobain's former home, and the site of his death. Pictured in 2010.]]
On April 8, 1994&lt;!--Cobain was recorded as having died on the 8th, the coroner believed he died on the 5th, please do not change this date.--&gt;, [[Kurt Cobain]], the lead singer of the [[grunge]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], was found dead at his home in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Forensic analysis at the time determined he had [[died by suicide]] on April 5. The [[Seattle Police Department]] [[incident report]] states: "Kurt Cobain was found with a [[shotgun]] across his body, had a visible head wound and there was a [[suicide note]] discovered nearby." The [[King County, Washington|King County]] Medical Examiner noted puncture wounds on the inside of both the right and left elbow. Prior to his death, Cobain had checked out of a [[drug rehabilitation]] facility and had been reported as suicidal by his wife [[Courtney Love]].

Despite the official ruling of suicide, it has been suggested that Cobain did not actually die from suicide. Tom Grant, a [[private investigator]] hired by Love to find Cobain after his departure from drug rehabilitation, believes that Cobain was [[homicide|murdered]] as the result of a conspiracy. Grant's theory has been analyzed and questioned by several books, television shows, films, and the 2015 [[docudrama]] ''[[Soaked in Bleach]]''. Authors and filmmakers have also attempted to explain what might have happened during Cobain's final days, and what might have led him to suicide.

== Discovery of Cobain's body ==
On April 8, 1994, Kurt Cobain was discovered in the living quarters above his garage at his [[Lake Washington Boulevard East]] house by VECA Electric employee Gary T. Smith. Smith arrived at the house that morning to install security lighting when he saw a deceased Cobain lying inside. He initially thought Cobain was asleep, until he saw blood oozing from his ear. He also found a [[suicide note]] with a pen stuck through it inside a flower pot. A [[shotgun]] purchased for Cobain by his friend [[Dylan Carlson]] was found resting on Cobain's chest.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;Odell, Michael. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050307093032/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=1419 "33 Things You Should Know About Nirvana"] ''[[Blender magazine|Blender]]'' magazine, Jan/Feb 2005. Archived December 30, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; commenting out ref that doesn't support the text; perhaps it's in the wrong place? --&gt; Cobain's [[death certificate]] stated that his death was a result of a "contact perforating shotgun wound to the head" and concluded that his death was a suicide.

=== Memorial and cremation ===
On April 10, 1994, a public [[memorial service]] was held at [[Seattle Center]], where a recording of [[Courtney Love]] reading Cobain's suicide note was played. Near the end of the [[vigil]], Love arrived and distributed some of his clothing to fans who remained.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, Michael (2001). ''Come As You Are: the Story of Nirvana''. Broadway Books/Random House: New York.  p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; In the following days, Love consoled and mourned with fans who came to her house.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Cobain's body was [[cremation|cremated]]. Love divided his ashes; she kept some in a [[teddy bear]] and some in an [[urn]].&lt;ref name="tour"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kurt Cobain's Final Tour|work=Esquire|date=February 1996|author=Dickinson, Amy}}&lt;/ref&gt; She took another portion of his ashes to the [[Namgyal Monastery|Namgyal Buddhist Monastery]] in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. There, some of his remains were ceremonially blessed by [[Buddhist monks]] and mixed into clay, which were used to make memorial sculptures.&lt;ref name="tour" /&gt; A final ceremony was arranged for Cobain by his mother on May 31, 1999, that was attended by both Love and [[About a Girl (Nirvana song)|Tracy Marander]]. A Buddhist monk chanted while his daughter, [[Frances Bean Cobain]], scattered his ashes into McLane Creek in [[Olympia, Washington]], the city where he "had found his true artistic muse."&lt;ref name=cross /&gt;{{rp|351}}

== Hypotheses==
=== Suicide ===
Advocates of the verdict of death by self-inflicted gunshot wound have cited Cobain's persistent [[drug addiction]], [[clinical depression]], and handwritten suicide note as conclusive proof. Members of Cobain's family also noticed patterns of depression and instability in Cobain before he achieved fame. Cobain mentioned that the stomach pains from an undiagnosed stomach condition were so severe during Nirvana's 1991 European tour that he became suicidal and stated that taking [[heroin]] was "[his] choice"; saying, "This [heroin] is the only thing that's saving me from shooting myself right now."&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Cobain's cousin Beverly, a nurse, stated that the singer's family had a history of suicide, that Cobain's [[bipolar disorder]] and his struggles with drug addiction led him to suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Libby |first1=Brian |url=http://consumer.healthday.com/encyclopedia/depression-12/depression-news-176/even-in-his-youth-644949.html |title=Even in His Youth |work=Consumer.HealthDay.com |accessdate=August 28, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903134727/http://consumer.healthday.com/encyclopedia/depression-12/depression-news-176/even-in-his-youth-644949.html |archivedate=September 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Charles R. Cross|Charles Cross]]'s biography ''[[Heavier Than Heaven]],'' Nirvana band member and bass guitarist [[Krist Novoselic]] is quoted on seeing Cobain in the days before his [[intervention (counseling)|intervention]]: "He was really quiet. He was just estranged from all of his relationships. He wasn't connecting with anybody."&lt;ref name=cross&gt;{{cite book|first1=Charles R.|last1=Cross|title=Heavier Than Heaven: A Biography of Kurt Cobain|publisher=Hyperion|date=August 21, 2002|isbn=0-7868-8402-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|332}} Novoselic's offer to buy a nice dinner for Cobain resulted in unintentionally driving him to score heroin: "His dealer was right there. He wanted to get fucked up into oblivion&amp;nbsp;... He wanted to die, that's what he wanted to do."&lt;ref name=cross /&gt;{{rp|333}} In his book ''[[Of Grunge and Government|Of Grunge and Government: Let's Fix This Broken Democracy]]'', Novoselic alludes to the circumstances of Cobain's death: "Tragically, Cobain picked the wrong way to resign from the position he was thrust into."&lt;ref&gt;Novoselic, Krist. ''Of Grunge and Government: Let's Fix This Broken Democracy.'' Akashic Books, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, the [[Seattle Police Department]] developed four rolls of film that had been left in an evidence vault. According to the Seattle police, the [[35mm]] photographs depict the scene of Cobain's corpse more clearly than previous [[Polaroid camera|Polaroid]] images taken by the police. Detective Mike Ciesynski, a [[cold case]] investigator, was asked to look at the film because "it is 20 years later and it's a high media case." Ciesynski stated that the official cause of Cobain's death remains suicide and that the images will not be released publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spangenthal-Lee |first=Jonah |title=(Updated) Detective Reviews Cobain Case, Which Remains Closed |url=http://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2014/03/31/detectives-reviews-cobain-case-which-remains-closed/ |publisher=[[Seattle Police Department]] |date=March 31, 2014 |accessdate=January 9, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231035032/http://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2014/03/31/detectives-reviews-cobain-case-which-remains-closed/ |archivedate=December 31, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kiro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Seattle police re-examine Cobain suicide, develop scene photos |url=http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/only-kiro-7-seattle-police-re-investigate-kurt-cob/nfHMq/ |work=kirotv.com |publisher=Cox Media Group |accessdate=March 27, 2014 |author=Casey McNerthney |author2=Amy Clancy |date=March 20, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326230140/http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/only-kiro-7-seattle-police-re-investigate-kurt-cob/nfHMq/ |archivedate=March 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a spokesperson for the Seattle police, the department receives at least one request weekly, mostly through [[Twitter]], to reopen the investigation. This resulted in the maintenance of the basic incident report on file.&lt;ref name="Kiro" /&gt;

=== Richard Lee ===
The first to object publicly to the report of suicide was Seattle [[public access]] host [[Richard Lee (journalist)|Richard Lee]]. A week following Cobain's death, Lee aired the first episode of an ongoing series called ''Kurt Cobain Was Murdered'', claiming there were several discrepancies in the police reports, including several changes in the nature of the shotgun blast. Lee acquired a video that was taped on April 8 from the tree outside Cobain's garage, showing the scene around Cobain's body, which he claimed showed a marked absence of blood for what was reported as a point-blank shotgun blast to the head. Several [[forensic pathology|pathology]] experts have stated that a shotgun blast inside the mouth often results in less blood, unlike a shotgun blast to the head.&lt;ref name=hw&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Halperin|last2=Wallace|title=Who Killed Kurt Cobain? The Mysterious Death of an Icon|publisher= Citadel|edition=June 1, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|128}}

=== Tom Grant ===
The main proponent of [[Murder|foul play]] surrounding Cobain's death is Tom Grant, a [[private investigator]] employed by Love after Cobain's disappearance from rehab. Grant was still under Love's employment when the body was found, and came to believe that Cobain's death was a [[homicide]]. There are several components to Grant's theory.

==== Bloodstream heroin levels ====
On April 14, 1994, the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' reported that Cobain was "high on heroin when he pulled the trigger". The paper reported that the [[toxicological]] tests determined that the level of morphine in Cobain's bloodstream was 1.52 milligrams per liter and that there was also evidence of [[diazepam|valium]] in his blood. The report contained a quote from Dr. Randall Baselt of the Chemical Toxicological Institute, stating that Cobain's heroin level was at "a high concentration, by any account". He also stated that the strength of that dose would depend on many factors, including how habituated Cobain was to the drug. Grant argues that Cobain could not have injected himself with such a dose and still have been able to pull the trigger.&lt;ref name=hw /&gt;

Grant does not believe that Cobain was killed by the heroin dose. He suggests that the heroin was used to incapacitate Cobain before the final shotgun blast was administered by the perpetrator.&lt;ref name=hw /&gt;{{rp|116}} Grant, Wallace, and Halperin have used the dosage reported in the ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', not the actual [[autopsy]] report, and may not have the correct figure. The Seattle police cannot release the information to the media because reports and records of autopsies are confidential and protected under state and federal law.

==== Suicide note ====
[[File:Kurt'sNote.jpg|thumb|right|Cobain's suicide note (full transcription). The final phrase before the greetings, {{quote|it's better to burn out than to fade away,}} is a quote from [[Neil Young]]'s song "[[Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)|My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)]]".]]
While working for Love, Grant was given access to Cobain's suicide note and used her [[fax machine]] to make a photocopy, which has since been widely distributed. After studying the notes, Grant believed that it was actually a letter written by Cobain announcing his intent to leave Love, Seattle, and the music business. Grant asserts that the lines at the very bottom of the note, separate from the rest, are the only parts implying suicide. While the official report on Cobain's death concluded that Cobain wrote the note, Grant claims that the official report does not distinguish these final lines from the rest of the note and assumes it was entirely written by Cobain.

Despite consulting with many handwriting experts, some disagree with Grant's claims. Document examiner Janis Parker concluded that the note was written by Cobain after spending two weeks examining the original copy. When ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' sent a copy of the note to four different handwriting experts, one concluded that the entire note was in Cobain's hand, while the other three said the sample was inconclusive.&lt;ref name=Dateline&gt;Lauer, Matt. "More questions in Kurt Cobain death?" ''[[Dateline NBC]].'' April 5, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; One expert contacted by the television series ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' expressed the difficulty in drawing a conclusion, given that the note being studied was a photocopy, not the original. But in the very same documentary, two other experts found the writing, especially the last four lines, suspicious.&lt;ref name=hw /&gt;{{rp|112}}

==== Shotgun ====
The shotgun, a [[20-gauge]] [[Remington Model 11]], was not checked for [[fingerprint]]s until May 6, 1994. According to the Fingerprint Analysis Report, four latent prints were lifted, but they were not usable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3497723/Seattle-police-release-photos-shotgun-used-Kurt-Cobain-s-suicide.html |title=Pictured for the first time: The shotgun used in Kurt Cobain's suicide 22 years ago |publisher=[[Mail Online]] |author1=Konstantinides, Anneta |author2=Farberov, Snejana |date=March 17, 2016 |accessdate=December 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222115029/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3497723/Seattle-police-release-photos-shotgun-used-Kurt-Cobain-s-suicide.html |archivedate=December 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Seattle police's follow-up report states that the shotgun was inverted on Cobain's chest with his left hand wrapped around the barrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2016/03/18/kurt-cobains-gun-suicide-rifle/ |title=Kurt Cobain -- Suicide Gun Unveiled (PHOTOS) |website=TMZ |accessdate=June 25, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517230135/http://www.tmz.com/2016/03/18/kurt-cobains-gun-suicide-rifle/ |archivedate=May 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outdoorhub.com/news/2016/03/18/photos-pictures-kurt-cobains-browning-auto-5-released-first-time/ |title=Photos: Pictures of Kurt Cobain's Browning Auto-5 Released for the First Time - OutdoorHub |website=outdoorhub.com |accessdate=June 25, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012132103/http://www.outdoorhub.com/news/2016/03/18/photos-pictures-kurt-cobains-browning-auto-5-released-first-time/ |archivedate=October 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Police report ====
Grant also cites [[circumstantial evidence]] from the official report. For example, the report claimed that the doors of the greenhouse could not have been locked from the outside, meaning that Cobain would have had to lock them himself. Grant claims that when he saw the doors for himself, he found that they could be locked and pulled shut. He also questions the lack of fingerprint evidence connecting Cobain to key evidence, including the shotgun. Grant notes that the official report claims that Cobain's fingerprints were also absent from the suicide note as well as the pen that had been shoved through it, and yet Cobain was found without gloves on. None of the circumstantial evidence directly points to murder, but Grant believes it supports the larger case.&lt;ref name=hw /&gt;{{rp|121}}
In the [[docudrama]] ''[[Soaked in Bleach]]'', Grant actually claims that the "cadaveric spasm" was mentioned in the police reports, whilst many have said that it was clearly not.

==== Rome incident ====
On March 3, 1994, Cobain was in a [[coma]] in a hospital in [[Rome]]. At the time, his management agency, [[Gold Mountain Records]], remarked that Cobain had accidentally taken too many painkillers due to him suffering from [[influenza]] and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Marla. "NAMES &amp; FACES." The Washington Post. N.p., March 5, 1994. Web. February 20, 2015. &lt;http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-879224.html?refid=easy_hf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, Love claimed that Cobain's [[overdose]] in Rome was a suicide attempt, telling ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s [[David Fricke]], "He took 50 pills. He probably forgot how many he took. But there was a definite suicidal urge, to be gobbling and gobbling and gobbling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David |last=Fricke |authorlink=David Fricke |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TggJYMdDaPkC&amp;pg=565 |title=Life After Death |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher= |date=December 15, 1994 |accessdate=July 14, 2013 }} Now in {{cite book|first=Mark |last=Yarm |title=Everybody Loves Our Town. A History of Grunge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TggJYMdDaPkC |year=2011 |publisher=[[Faber and Faber|Faber &amp; Faber]] |location=London |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TggJYMdDaPkC&amp;pg=439 439] |isbn=978-0-571-27650-9 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707093146/http://books.google.com/books?id=TggJYMdDaPkC |archivedate=July 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying the Rome incident, journalists [[Ian Halperin]] and [[Max Wallace]] contacted Dr. Osvaldo Galletta, who treated Cobain after the incident. Galletta contested the claim that the Rome overdose was a suicide attempt, telling Halperin and Wallace, "We can usually tell a suicide attempt. This didn't look like one to me." Galletta also specifically denied Love's claim that 50 [[Rohypnol]] pills were removed from Cobain's stomach.&lt;ref name=hw /&gt;{{rp|89}}

However, they also stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Grant believes Courtney may have mixed a large number of pills into Kurt's champagne so that when he took a drink, he was actually unknowingly ingesting large amounts of the drug, enough to kill him. But if that's the case, why did she call the police when she found him unconscious on the floor? If she wanted Kurt dead, why didn't she just leave him on the floor until he died?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Galletta also said that Cobain's recovery was aided by the intervention of Love, who called for help.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Grant believes that the claim of the Rome incident being a suicide attempt was not made until after Cobain's death. He claims that people close to Cobain, including Gold Mountain Records, specifically denied the characterization prior to Cobain's death. Grant believes that if Rome had truly been a suicide attempt, Cobain's friends and family would have been told so that they could have watched over him. Others have asserted that the claims by Gold Mountain and others were simply efforts to mask what was happening behind the scenes. [[Lee Ranaldo]], guitarist for [[Sonic Youth]], told ''Rolling Stone'', "Rome was only the latest installment of [those around Cobain] keeping a semblance of normalcy for the outside world."&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Neil. "The Downward Spiral." ''Cobain: By the Editors of Rolling Stone.'' 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rosemary Carroll ====
Grant spoke to Cobain's attorney, Rosemary Carroll, at her office on April 13, 1994. He said she pressed him to investigate Cobain's death, and that Cobain was not suicidal. Carroll also claims that Cobain had asked her to draw up a [[Will and testament|will]] excluding Love because he was planning to file for [[divorce]]. Grant said this was the motive for Cobain's death.&lt;ref name=hw /&gt;{{rp|119}} Carroll also provided Grant with a handwriting practice note that she found in Love's backpack that was left at her home. It has been suggested that the handwriting on this practice note is markedly similar to the handwriting found on the last four lines of Cobain's suicide note.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theunredacted.com/the-death-of-kurt-cobain-never-fade-away/ |title=The Death of Kurt Cobain: Never Fade Away |date=April 18, 2017 |website=theunredacted.com |accessdate=June 25, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104202528/http://theunredacted.com/the-death-of-kurt-cobain-never-fade-away/ |archivedate=November 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nick Broomfield ===
Filmmaker [[Nick Broomfield]], deciding to investigate the theories himself, brought a film crew to visit a number of people associated with both Cobain and Love, including Love's estranged father, Cobain's aunt, and one of the couples' former nannies. Broomfield also spoke to [[The Mentors]]' bandleader [[Eldon Hoke|Eldon "El Duce" Hoke]], who claimed that Love had offered him $50,000 to kill Cobain. Although Hoke claimed that he knew who killed Cobain, he did not mention a name and offered no evidence to support his assertion. However, he mentioned speaking to someone called "Allen" (Allen Wrench), before quickly interjecting, "I mean, my friend", then laughing, "I'll let the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] catch him." Broomfield incidentally captured Hoke's final interview, as he died days later when he was struck by a train in the middle of the night.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Broomfield titled the finished documentary ''[[Kurt &amp; Courtney]]'', which was released on February 27, 1998. In the end, Broomfield felt he hadn't uncovered enough evidence to conclude the existence of a conspiracy. In a 1998 interview, he summed up his thoughts: "I think that he committed suicide. I don't think that there's a [[smoking gun]]. And I think there's only one way you can explain a lot of things around his death. Not that he was murdered, but that there was just a lack of caring for him. I just think that Courtney had moved on, and he was expendable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller |first=Prairie |url=http://www.detailsonkurtcobainsdeath.com/broomsfeild.htm |title=Interview with Nick Broomsfeild |publisher=Detailsonkurtcobainsdeath.com |accessdate=August 3, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208062709/http://www.detailsonkurtcobainsdeath.com/broomsfeild.htm |archivedate=December 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ian Halperin and Max Wallace ===
Journalists Halperin and Wallace followed a similar path and attempted to investigate the murder theory themselves. Their initial work, the 1999 book ''Who Killed Kurt Cobain?'', drew a similar conclusion to Broomfield's film: while there wasn't enough evidence to conclusively prove foul play, there was more than enough to demand that the case be reopened. A notable element of the book included their discussions with Grant, who had taped nearly every conversation he had undertaken while he was working for Love. Halperin and Wallace insisted that Grant play the tapes of his conversations with Carroll so that they could confirm his story. Over the next several years, Halperin and Wallace collaborated with Grant to write a second book, 2004's ''[[Love and Death: The Murder of Kurt Cobain]]''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== Contesting the murder theory ===
Grant counters the claim that he profits from the sale of casebook kits on his website by stating that it offsets some of the costs of his investigation. Grant stated: "I wrestled with that&amp;nbsp;... but if I go broke, I'll have to give up my pursuit and Courtney wins."&lt;ref&gt;Halperin &amp; Wallace, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Sergeant Donald Cameron, one of the homicide detectives involved in the case, specifically dismissed Grant's theory, claiming, "[Grant] hasn't shown us a shred of proof that this was anything other than suicide." Cameron, however, has been accused of being a personal friend of Love's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/memoriam-kurt-cobain-courtney-love-15940/ |title=In Memoriam: Kurt Cobain &amp; Courtney Love |publisher=[[TheWrap]] |date=April 4, 2010 |accessdate=May 22, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513032119/http://www.thewrap.com/memoriam-kurt-cobain-courtney-love-15940/ |archivedate=May 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dylan Carlson]] told Halperin and Wallace that he also did not believe that the theory was legitimate, and in an interview with Broomfield implied that if he believed that his friend was murdered, he would have dealt with it himself. In ''[[Kurt &amp; Courtney]]'', he specifically states that he would kill Love and any others involved if he believed that they had murdered Cobain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YS8SbCeTW8 |title=Kurt Cobain's death - Dylan Carlson talking about it. |publisher=YouTube |date=July 27, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621011511/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YS8SbCeTW8 |archivedate=June 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has criticized Grant's investigation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Many of Cobain's friends and family have supported the suicide verdict. Novoselic has voiced his opinion that Cobain killed himself. Cobain's friend [[Everett True]] also shared this opinion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=True |first=Everett |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/aug/24/grunge-myths-nirvana-kurt-cobain |title=Ten myths about grunge, Nirvana and Kurt Cobain &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date=August 24, 2011 |accessdate=August 3, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920102453/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/aug/24/grunge-myths-nirvana-kurt-cobain |archivedate=September 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Dave Grohl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buchanan |first=Brett |url=http://grungereport.net/?p=3809 |title=Alternativenation.Net &amp;#124; Dave Grohl Talks About Kurt Cobain'S Death, Calls It "Heartbreaking" |publisher=Grungereport.net |date=March 29, 2011 |accessdate=August 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118132623/http://grungereport.net/?p=3809 |archivedate=January 18, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions of Cobain's friends ==
Several of Cobain's friends have accepted that it was suicide, but were surprised when it happened. [[Mark Lanegan]], a long-time friend of Cobain's, told ''Rolling Stone'': "I never knew [Cobain] to be suicidal. I just knew he was going through a tough time."&lt;ref&gt;Strauss.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same article, Carlson stated that he wished Cobain or someone close to him had told him that Rome was a suicide attempt. Danny Goldberg, husband of Carroll and founder of Gold Mountain Records, refers in his book ''Dispatches From the Culture Wars: How the Left Lost Teen Spirit'' to "the crazy Internet rumors that Kurt Cobain had not committed suicide but had been murdered," stating that Cobain's suicide "haunts [him] every day".&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Danny. ''Dispatches From the Culture Wars: How the Left Lost Teen Spirit.'' Miramax, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, Sonic Youth's [[Kim Gordon]] was asked about Cobain's death in an interview for [[UNCUT (magazine)|''Uncut'' Magazine]]. When asked what she thought to be Cobain's motive in committing suicide, Gordon replied: "I don't even know that he killed himself. There are people close to him who don't think that he did&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, Stephen. "[https://archive.is/20080418075203/http://www.beautifullyscarred.net/article44.htm Suicide Blond]." Uncut Magazine August 2005. ''Beautifully Scarred''. Accessed on August 24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked if she thought someone else had killed him, Gordon answered, "I do, yes." In the same interview, Gordon's then-husband and collaborator [[Thurston Moore]] stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;Kurt died in a very harsh way. It wasn't just an OD. He actually killed himself violently. It was so aggressive, and he wasn't an aggressive person, he was a smart person, he had an interesting intellect. So it kind of made sense because it was like: wow, what a fucking gesture. But at the same time it was like: something's wrong with that gesture. It doesn't really lie with what we know.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Anthony Kiedis]], lead singer of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], expressed his feelings in his autobiography, ''[[Scar Tissue (book)|Scar Tissue]]'', writing: &lt;blockquote&gt;One day we were working and got a call from Lindy, who informed us that Kurt Cobain had killed himself. The news sucked the air out of the entire house, I didn't feel like I felt when [[Hillel Slovak|Hillel]] died; it was more like "The world just suffered a great loss." Kurt's death was unexpected&amp;nbsp;... It was an emotional blow, and we all felt it. I don't know why everyone on earth felt so close to that guy; he was beloved and endearing and inoffensive in some weird way. For all of his screaming and all of his darkness, he was just lovable.&lt;ref name="ST"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Anthony Kiedis|Kiedis, Anthony]], [[Larry Sloman|Sloman, Larry]]|title=Scar Tissue|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWZrAwAAQBAJ|date=October 1, 2004|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=EWZrAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT236 236]|publisher=[[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette UK]]|location=London|isbn=978-1-4013-8176-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The song "[[Tearjerker (song)|Tearjerker]]" from the band's ''[[One Hot Minute]]'' album was written about Cobain.&lt;ref name="ST"/&gt;

A musical hero of Cobain's, [[Greg Sage]], said about him in an interview: &lt;blockquote&gt;Well, I can't really speculate other than what he said to me, which was, he wasn't at all happy about it, success to him seemed like, I think, a brick wall. There was nowhere else to go but down, it was too artificial for him, and he wasn't an artificial person at all. He was actually, two weeks after he died, he was supposed to come here and he wanted to record a bunch of Leadbelly covers. It was kind of in secret, because, I mean, people would definitely not allow him to do that. You also have to wonder, he was a billion-dollar industry at the time, and if the industry had any idea at all of him wishing or wanting to get out, they couldn't have allowed that, you know, in life, because if he was just to get out of the scene, he'd be totally forgotten, but if he was to die, he'd be immortalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smokebox.net/archives/interviews/sage801.html |title=interview with greg sage |author=Marc Covert |accessdate=May 3, 2007 |year=2003 |publisher=Smokebox.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716173817/http://www.smokebox.net/archives/interviews/sage801.html |archivedate=July 16, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cobain's grandfather, Leland Cobain, publicly said that he believes Cobain "was murdered" and not the victim of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Todd.

'''Vostok 5''' ({{lang-ru|'''Восток-5'''}}, ''[[Orient]] 5'' or ''[[East]] 5'') was a joint mission of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] space program together with [[Vostok 6]]; as with the previous pair of [[Vostok 3]] and [[Vostok 4]] the two [[Vostok spacecraft]] came close to one another in orbit and established a radio link.

==Mission==
Several delays plagued the prelaunch preparations of Vostok 5, the biggest being concern over elevated [[solar flare]] activity. At this early phase, it was not well understood what effects this might have on the spacecraft and its passenger, so the planned launch date of 11 June was postponed a few days. On the 14th, Bykovsky was strapped into the capsule awaiting liftoff when further delays occurred. A [[gyroscope]] in the Blok E stage malfunctioned and needed to be replaced, but this would mean removing the propellants from the booster, taking it down from the pad back to the vehicle assembly building, and delaying the launch another several days. It was decided to take the calculated risk of simply doing the repair work on the fully fueled launch vehicle. A replacement gyroscope was quickly installed and liftoff took place at 2:59 PM Moscow time. One last minor problem popped up when a pad umbilical failed to disconnect, but as soon as the booster began lifting, it was yanked out. The launch proceeded without any difficulties, although the Blok E stage slightly underperformed and put the spacecraft into a lower-than-intended orbit at 108x137 miles (175x222 kilometers) versus the normal 112x146 miles (181x235 kilometers).

[[Astronaut|Cosmonaut]] [[Valery Bykovsky]] was originally intended to stay in orbit for eight days, but the mission details changed many times due to elevated levels of solar flare activity at the time and he was eventually ordered back after five days. This remains the record for solo manned flight in Earth orbit. In addition, the low orbit of the spacecraft made it uncertain as to whether decay would not occur in under eight days. This combined with solar flare activity affecting the diameter of the Earth's atmosphere might potentially introduce drag that could not only cause premature reentry, but result in Vostok 5 landing almost anywhere on Earth.

Bykovsky performed a couple of simple scientific experiments in orbit and also practiced exercise and testing his body's reactions to weightlessness. In the postflight debriefing, he would say that the overall design of the spacecraft was good, but the clock was in a location that made it hard to see and the instrument panel was placed too far away. The first aid kit could not be reached at all without unstrapping from the seat. Like [[Valentina Tereshkova]], he noted that the helmet headset produced sharp, unpleasant noise. He described the food as generally of good quality, although it probably should not be eaten before launch.

A problem with the spacecraft's [[toilet|waste collection system]] is reported to have made conditions "unpleasant" in the capsule. The only other difficulty encountered was that, like on [[Vostok 1]] and [[Vostok 2]], the re-entry module failed to separate cleanly from the service module when it was time for Bykovsky to come home and he experienced several seconds of sharp vibrations following separations.

The Vostok 5 landing coordinates were {{coord|53.39777|N|67.60500|E}}, 2&amp;nbsp;km northwest of Karatal, North Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan; and 550&amp;nbsp;km northwest of Karagandy, Kazakhstan. A group of local farmers greeted Bykovsky prior to rescue crews arriving. At the landing location is a small fenced park with two monuments. One monument is a 10-meter tall silver rectangle with a small stone marker nearby listing the date of the landing. The second monument is an L-shaped sandy colored stone structure. One leg of the "L" is an observation deck with stairs leading to it. The other leg of the "L" has a space-themed mural carved into the stone face. The mural depicts a floating cosmonaut in a spacesuit surrounded by stars, telescopes, planets, and the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=53.399771,67.606623&amp;spn=0.006294,0.017359&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=lyrftr:com.panoramio.all,3829704584548780242,53.398326,67.605851&amp;lci=com.panoramio.all|title = Google Maps - Vostok 5 Landing Site - Stone Monument Photo|accessdate = 2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=53.398326,67.605851&amp;spn=0,0.017359&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;lci=com.panoramio.all&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=53.398326,67.605851&amp;cbp=12,0,,0,5&amp;photoid=po-32335660|title = Google Maps - Vostok 5 Landing Site - Stone Monument Photo - Closeup|accessdate = 2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=53.398326,67.605851&amp;spn=0,0.017359&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;lci=com.panoramio.all&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=53.398326,67.605851&amp;cbp=12,0,,0,5&amp;photoid=po-32335670|title = Google Maps - Vostok 5 Landing Site - Metal Monument Photo|accessdate = 2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wewe Gombel''' is a female [[demon|supernatural being]] or [[ghost]] in [[Javanese mythology]]. It is said that she kidnaps children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mariapriskamarvina.wordpress.com/page/3/ Indonesian Ghosts]&lt;/ref&gt; 

This myth is taught to encourage children to be cautious and to stay at home at night. Traditionally, the Wewe Gombel is represented as a woman with long, hanging breasts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seni-dan-antik.tokobagus.com/patung-kerajinan-kayu/patung-primitif-wewe-gombel-kuno-8345608.html Patung Primitif Wewe Gombel]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern representations include [[vampire]]-like [[fangs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://juriglagu.multiply.com/photos/photo/3094/11 Kartu Mistis Indonesia]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a popular spirit that also appears in [[comics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyunyu.com/medias/2012/03/+Mitos6.jpg Wewe Gombel comic]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
The ghost was named Wewe Gombel because it is related to an event that, according to ancient folklore, happened in Bukit Gombel, [[Semarang]], where long ago a married couple lived.  
They had been married for years, but as time went by the husband realized that his wife was [[Female infertility|barren]] and stopped loving her. The husband became wayward, neglecting his wife and leaving her alone for long periods of time, so that she lived in sorrow. One day she followed him and caught him in a sexual relationship with another woman. Hurt by her husband's betrayal she became furious and killed him. Faced with the crime, angry neighbors gathered in a mob and chased her from the village. Despairing at the ostracization and continual harassment, she committed suicide. 

After death her [[vengeful spirit]] became Wewe Gombel. Sundanese folklore says that she dwells in the crown of the ''[[Arenga pinnata]]'' palm, where she has her nest and keeps the children she catches. She does not harm them and once they are under her clutches they are not afraid of her.

Local traditions say that the children she abducts have been [[Child mistreatment|mistreated]] or [[Child neglect|neglected]] by their parents. She treats the children lovingly as a grandmother would, taking care of them and protecting them until their parents repent, at which point she returns them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mariapriskamarvina.wordpress.com/2011/12/ Wewe Gombel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wewe Gombel has affinities with the ghost known as [[Hantu Kopek]] in [[Malay folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://creatifcorner.blogspot.com/2009/09/koleksi-hantu-hantu-malaysia.html Hantu kopek]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern adaptations==
Wewe Gombel has been featured in Indonesian movies, such as the 1988 film [[Wewe Gombel (film)|Wewe Gombel]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmindonesia.or.id/movie/title/lf-w010-88-521115_wewe-gombel#.UO_dUuRMRWo Wewe Gombel 1988 - Film Indonesia]&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2012 film [[Legenda Wewe Gombel]] (The Legend of Wewe Gombel).&lt;ref&gt;[http://downloadffilmfree.blogspot.com/2010/02/download-film-wewe-gombel-gratis.html Wewe Gombel Movie]&lt;/ref&gt; Representations of Wewe Gombel are sometimes part of popular local festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.detik.com/read/2012/01/10/173346/1811977/1025/hii-gendruwo-dan-wewe-gombel-bakal-gentayangan-di-yogya?vt22011024 Hii!

'''Zooidogamy''' is a type of [[plant]] [[reproduction]] in which male [[gamete]]s ([[antherozoid]]s) swim in a path of water to the female gametes ([[archegonium]]).  Zoidogamy is found in [[algae]], [[bryophyte]]s, [[pteridophyte]]s, and some [[gymnosperm]]s (others use [[siphonogamy]]).  Zoidogamy relates to [[evolution]], as it provides a pathway from wind-borne abiotic [[pollination]] and similar mechanisms to fluid-based mechanisms used in most animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/93/21/11713.pdf Zoidogamy in fossil gymnosperms: The centenary of a concept, with special reference to prepollen of late Paleozoic conifers]&lt;/ref&gt;
