[[File:Boeing SB-29.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing B-29 Superfortress variants#SB-29|Boeing SB-29 "Super Dumbo"]] with AN/APQ-13 radome between the nose landing gear and the airborne lifeboat]]
The '''AN/APQ-13''' radar was an American ground scanning radar developed by [[Bell Laboratories]], [[Western Electric]], and [[MIT]] as an improved model of the airborne [[H2X radar]], itself developed from the first ground scanning radar, the British [[H2S radar]]. It was used on [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29]]s during [[World War II]] in the [[Pacific war|Pacific theater]] for high altitude area bombing, search and navigation. Computation for bombing could be performed by an impact predictor. A range unit permitted a high degree of accuracy in locating beacons. The [[radome]] was carried on the aircraft belly between the bomb bays and was partially retractable on early models. The radar operated at a frequency of 9375 ± 45 megahertz and used a [[superheterodyne receiver]].

==Weather radar use==
The AN/APQ-13 radar was the first military radar converted to civilian use as a weather warning radar. About 30 systems were converted, starting in late 1945. They were installed at military bases.&lt;ref name="HEM"&gt;Historical Electronics Museum [http://www.nationalelectronicsmuseum.org/past-gallery.shtml &lt;http://www.nationalelectronicsmuseum.org/past-gallery.shtml&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128121138/http://www.nationalelectronicsmuseum.org/past-gallery.shtml |date=28 January 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last operational APQ-13 was removed from the [[Fort Sill|Fort Sill, Oklahoma]] post weather station in October 1977 for display at what is now the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]]. The museum intended to display it in its original configuration as a navigation and bombing radar, but would note the radar's much longer history as an operational weather radar.&lt;ref name="amsrad"&gt;Roger C. Whiton, et al. "History of Operational Use of Weather Radar by U.S. Weather Services. Part I: The Pre-NEXRAD Era." &lt;u&gt;Weather and Forecasting&lt;/u&gt;: Vol. 13, No. 2, pp. 219–243. 19 February 1998. American Meteorological Society. 5 April 2006 [http://ams.allenpress.com/amsonline/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1175%2F1520-0434(1998)013%3C0219:HOOUOW%3E2.0.CO%3B2 &lt;http://ams.allenpress.com/amsonline/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1175%2F1520-0434(1998)013%3C0219:HOOUOW%3E2.0.CO%3B2&gt;]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AN/APQ-13 weather radars were generally replaced by the [[AN/CPS-9]], which was specifically designed as a weather radar.&lt;ref name="HEM"/&gt;

'''Accel''' (formerly known as ACCEL/Exchange) is an [[interbank network]]. It connects over 412,000 
[[automatic teller machine]]s (ATMs) in all 50 states in the [[United States]]. The network also has a small number of ATMs in certain U.S. [[Air Force Base]]s around the world, and over 3.3 million [[electronic funds transfer]] at point-of-sale locations.

Operating in Canada as '''The Exchange''', it provides 3300 ATMs to customers of 170 financial institutions, including smaller banks like [[National Bank of Canada]] and [[Canadian Western Bank]], credit unions and online banks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theexchangenetwork.ca/default.aspx?PageID=1047&amp;LangID=en]&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. division is managed by [[Fiserv]].

==History==
*1985: Accel was founded, by major banks in the Northwest of the United States, primarily as an [[electronic funds transfer]] network.
*1991: Accel began a business partnership with The Exchange network creating ACCEL/Exchange. 
*In the 1990s most banks in the Pacific Northwest were part of this network including [[Seafirst Bank]]/[[Bank of America]], [[US Bank]], [[First Interstate Bancorp|First Interstate Bank]], Puget Sound Bank, [[Rainier Bank]]/[[Security Pacific]], [[Key Bank]] and West One Bank.  Since then, bank mergers caused some banks to leave the Accel/Exchange network.  Now only Key Bank is part of Accel/Exchange when it comes to major banks in the Northwest.
*2013: In April, the company streamlined the name from "ACCEL/Exchange" to simply "Accel," a result of a repositioning of the debit payment network, and a reflection of its current "ability to accelerate funds transfers across retail, biller and social person-to-person payments. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/news/fiserv-accelexchange-now-just-accel/ Fiserv ACCEL/Exchange now just Accel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adaptive equipment''' are [[tool|device]]s that are used to assist with completing [[activities of daily living]].

[[Bathing]], dressing, [[Personal grooming|grooming]], toileting, and feeding are self-care activities that are including in the spectrum of activities of daily living (ADLs).
Jennifer McLaughlin Maly a P.T./ D.P.T. in her article located in the journal Exceptional Parent gives a more complete definition of adaptive equipment: "Typically, a piece of adaptive equipment is utilized to increase a child's function. Examples of adaptive equipment or assistive technology are wheelchairs, lifts, standing frames, gait trainers, augmentative communication devices, bath chairs, and recreational items such as swings or tricycles."&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin Maly, J. (2007). My child needs a piece of adaptive equipment: Now what? Well it depends! The Exceptional Parent, 11(37), 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

A growing market for adaptive equipment is in the use of mobility vans. In this case, adaptive equipment, also known as assistive technology, can help a person with a disability operate a motor vehicle when otherwise they would not be able to.

== Mobility assistance ==
Mobility adaptive equipment are used in cases where a disease or accident leaves an individual's motor functions hindered or unusable. if an individual suffers from restricted motor functions, there are Equipment and technology that can assist in regaining some or all mobility.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9545">'''The Alliance for Biosecurity''' is a consortium of companies that develop products to respond to national security threats, including [[bioterrorism]] pathogens and emerging [[infectious diseases]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/hearings/Alliance%20for%20Biosecurity.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is headquartered in Washington DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/0604148D:US-alliance-for-biosecurity|title=Alliance for Biosecurity: Company Profile|website=Bloomberg|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The United States faces risks to national security posed by the danger of bioterrorism or a destabilizing infectious disease pandemic. The vulnerability is considered severe because many of the vaccines and medicines that would be needed to protect people do not currently exist. The Alliance for Biosecurity is a group of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that work to create preventive measures and treatments for severe infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allianceforbiosecurity.org/about2-c4nz|title=Our Work|last=|first=|date=|website=Alliance for Biosecurity|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214102551/https://www.allianceforbiosecurity.org/about2-c4nz|archive-date=2017-02-14|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the U.S. federal government, the [[Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority]] (BARDA) and the [[Project Bioshield Act|Project BioShield]] Special Reserve Fund (SRF) provide funding to research, develop, and procure a medicines to control epidemics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
The Alliance for Biosecurity was formed in 2005. Its purpose was to build a partnership between government and private sector biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies working in the biodefense space. The Center for Biosecurity, a nonprofit multidisciplinary organization of physicians public health professionals and scientists, was an organizer of the alliance and participates in it. Together, the two groups have provided congressional testimony and authored letters to Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, Joseph. ''Six Years After Anthrax: Are We Better Prepared to Respond to Terrorism?: Hearing Before the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate''. 2009. DIANE Publishing. {{ISBN|1437911064}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, the alliance conducted a national poll about biosecurity. Seventy-three percent of the 1,612 Americans polled said they would support a congressional decision to increase funding to address biosecurity needs and capabilities. The poll was conducted, in part, to measure support for biosecurity funding because reauthorization of the [[Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act]] (PAHPA) is due by September 30, 2018. PAHPA is a law that improved the federal government's medical and public health preparedness for national security threats. Examples of threats include the spread of infectious diseases or chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://susanwbrooks.house.gov/media-center/in-the-news/survey-reveals-american-majority-favors-increased-biosecurity-funding|title=Survey reveals American majority favors increased biosecurity funding|date=2018-04-16|work=Congresswoman Susan W. Brooks|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Congress passed the annual Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill before the end of the fiscal year for the first time in over 20 years. Congress also passed a Department of Defense appropriations bill before the end of the fiscal year for the first time in 10 years. The alliance supported passage of both bills. Key funding in the bills included:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mailchi.mp/effa76fecae0/fy-2018-discretionary-additions-are-needed-to-support-necessary-preparedness-activities-305487?e=%5BUNIQID%5D|title=Congress Funds Key Biosecurity Efforts|last=|first=|date=|website=Alliance for Biosecurity|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Project BioShield Special Reserve Fund (SRF): The fund received a $25 million increase. The SRF was first funded in 2004 and receives an annualized funding level of around $510 million since 2004. The current funding level is $735 million. The program creates public-private partnerships to advance the development of over 50 million doses of drugs against anthrax, smallpox, botulinum toxin and radiological threats.
* Project BioShield: This program creates incentives for companies to invest in R&amp;D in products for biodefense, because no commercial markets for such projects exist.

== Mission ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Alliance for Biosecurity is a coalition of biopharmaceutical companies and laboratory/academic partners that promotes a strong public-private partnership to ensure medical countermeasures are available to protect public health and enhance national health security. The Alliance advocates for public policies and funding to support the rapid development, production, stockpiling, and distribution of critically needed medical countermeasures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allianceforbiosecurity.org/mission|title=Our Mission|last=|first=|date=|website=Alliance for Biosecurity|access-date=2017-02-13}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Legislative support ==
The alliance has supported the following legislation:
* '''21st Century Cures Act''' - legislation passed in the U.S. Senate that promotes innovation and efficiency in the development of new medical countermeasures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/biological-threats/20402-alliance-biosecurity-praises-senate-passage-21st-century-cures-act/|title=Alliance for Biosecurity praises Senate passage of 21st Century Cures Act|last=|first=|date=2016-12-08|newspaper=Homeland Preparedness News|access-date=2017-02-22|work=|language=en-US|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Medical Countermeasures Innovation Act of 2015''' - legislation that would encourage the development of medical countermeasures, including drugs, devices and preventative treatments that could be used after a biological terrorist attack or global pandemic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/policy/17650-alliance-for-biosecurity-applauds-alexanders-actions-to-advance/|title=Alliance for Biosecurity applauds Alexander's actions to advance the Medical Countermeasures Innovation Act|last=|first=|date=2016-01-22|newspaper=Homeland Preparedness News|access-date=2017-02-22|work=|language=en-US|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018''' (H.R. 6378) - legislation that would reauthorize the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA) before its expiration on September 30, 2018. The alliance sent a letter with the [[United States Chamber of Commerce|U.S. Chamber of Commerce]] to each member of the House of Representatives urging its passage.&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/d3b183_b36530fc878e44f98a765d1a2e8e11ce.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Strengthening Public Health Emergency Response Act''' - legislation that creates new research incentives, improves transparency, and creates "predictable and flexible contracting"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/countermeasures/19313-alliance-biosecurity-applauds-passage-public-health-emergency-response-bill-committee/|title=Alliance for Biosecurity applauds passage of public health emergency response bill by committee|last=|first=|date=2016-07-21|newspaper=Homeland Preparedness News|access-date=2017-02-22|work=|language=en-US|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The alliance also gives out awards to Congress. For example, in October 2017 it awarded eight Members of Congress, such as Maryland Congressman [[Dutch Ruppersberger]], with its "Congressional Biosecurity Champion Award," which honors elected officials who work to improve how the U.S. can prevent and fight [[biosecurity]] threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/featured/24896-alliance-biosecurity-hails-rep-ruppersbergers-champion-efforts-around-bioterrorism-prevention/|title=Alliance for Biosecurity hails Rep.

The '''aspect ratio''' of an image describes the proportional relationship between its width and its height. It is commonly expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, as in ''16:9''. For an ''x'':''y'' aspect ratio, no matter how big or small the image is, if the width is divided into ''x'' units of equal length and the height is measured using this same length unit, the height will be measured to be ''y'' units.

For example, in a group of images that all have an aspect ratio of 16:9, one image might be 16&amp;nbsp;inches wide and 9&amp;nbsp;inches high, another 16 centimeters wide and 9 centimeters high, and a third might be 8 yards wide and 4.5 yards high. Thus, aspect ratio concerns the ''relationship'' of the width to the height, not an image's actual size.

== Some common examples ==

The most common aspect ratios used today in the presentation of [[film]]s in cinemas are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1.&lt;ref name="anamorphic"&gt;The 2.39:1 ratio is commonly labeled 2.40:1, e.g., in the [[American Society of Cinematographers]]' ''American Cinematographer Manual'' (Many widescreen films before the 1970 [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers|SMPTE]] revision used 2.35:1).&lt;/ref&gt; Two common [[videography|videographic]] aspect ratios are 4:3 (1.{{overline|3}}:1),{{Efn|[[Repeating decimal#Notation|Repeating decimal notation]]}} the universal video format of the 20th century, and [[16:9]] (1.{{overline|7}}:1), universal for [[high-definition television]] and European [[digital television]]. Other cinema and video aspect ratios exist, but are used infrequently.

In [[still camera]] photography, the most common aspect ratios are 4:3, 3:2, and more recently found in consumer cameras, 16:9.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.techtree.com/India/News/Panasonic_Introduces_2_New_Cameras/551-97953-893.html |title=Panasonic Introduces 2 New Cameras |publisher=Tech Tree |location=India |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123073441/http://techtree.com/India/News/Panasonic_Introduces_2_New_Cameras/551-97953-893.html |archivedate=2009-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other aspect ratios, such as 5:3, 5:4, and 1:1 (square format), are used in photography as well, particularly in [[medium format]] and [[large format]].

With television, [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]], converting formats of unequal ratios is achieved by enlarging the original image to fill the receiving format's display area and cutting off any excess picture information ([[digital zoom|zooming]] and [[cropping]]), by adding horizontal mattes ([[letterbox]]ing) or vertical mattes ([[pillarbox]]ing) to retain the original format's aspect ratio, by stretching (hence distorting) the image to fill the receiving format's ratio, or by scaling by different factors in both directions, possibly scaling by a different factor in the center and at the edges (as in ''Wide Zoom mode'').

== Practical limitations ==
In motion picture formats, the physical size of the film area between the [[sprocket]] perforations determines the image's size. The universal standard (established by [[William Kennedy Dickson|William Dickson]] and [[Thomas Edison]] in 1892) is a frame that is four perforations high. The film itself is 35&amp;nbsp;mm wide (1.38&amp;nbsp;in), but the area between the perforations is 24.89&amp;nbsp;mm × 18.67&amp;nbsp;mm (0.980&amp;nbsp;in × 0.735&amp;nbsp;in), leaving the de facto ratio of 4:3, or 1.{{overline|3}}:1.&lt;ref name="asc"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Burum | first = Stephen | year = 2004 | title = American Cinematographer Manual | edition = 9th | publisher = ASC Press | isbn = 0-935578-24-2 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a space designated for the standard [[sound-on-film|optical soundtrack]], and the frame size reduced to maintain an image that is wider than tall, this resulted in the [[Academy ratio|Academy]] aperture of 22&amp;nbsp;mm × 16&amp;nbsp;mm (0.866&amp;nbsp;in × 0.630&amp;nbsp;in) or 1.375:1 aspect ratio.

== Cinema terminology ==
The [[motion picture industry]] convention assigns a value of 1.0 to the image’s height; an [[anamorphic]] frame (since 1970, 2.39:1) is often incorrectly described (rounded) as 2.40:1 or 2.40 ("two-four-oh"). After 1952, a number of aspect ratios were experimented with for anamorphic productions, including 2.66:1 and 2.55:1.&lt;ref name="arri"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arri.com/?eID=registration&amp;file_uid=7737 |title=ALEXA Anamorphic De-squeeze |publisher=Arri |date=2011-07-07 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers|SMPTE]] specification for anamorphic projection from 1957 (PH22.106-1957) finally standardized the aperture to 2.35:1.&lt;ref name="arri"/&gt; An update in 1970 (PH22.106-1971) changed the aspect ratio to 2.39:1 in order to make splices less noticeable.&lt;ref name="arri"/&gt; This aspect ratio of 2.39:1 was confirmed by the most recent revision from August 1993 (SMPTE 195-1993).&lt;ref name="arri"/&gt;

In American cinemas, the common projection ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1. Some European countries have 1.{{overline|6}}:1 as the wide screen standard. The "Academy ratio" of 1.375:1 was used for all cinema films in the sound era until 1953 (with the release of [[George Stevens|George Stevens']] ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' in 1.{{overline|6}}:1). During that time, television, which had a similar aspect ratio of 1.{{overline|3}}:1, became a perceived threat to movie studios. Hollywood responded by creating a large number of wide-screen formats: [[CinemaScope]] (up to 2.{{overline|6}}:1), [[Todd-AO]] (2.20:1), and [[VistaVision]] (initially 1.50:1, now 1.{{overline|6}}:1 to 2.00:1) to name just a few. The "flat" 1.85:1 aspect ratio was introduced in May 1953, and became one of the most common cinema projection standards in the U.S. and elsewhere.

The goal of these various lenses and aspect ratios was to capture as much of the frame as possible, onto as large an area of the film as possible, in order to fully utilize the film being used. Some of the aspect ratios were chosen to utilize smaller film sizes in order to save film costs while other aspect ratios were chosen to use larger film sizes in order to produce a wider higher resolution image. In either case the image was squeezed horizontally to fit the film's frame size and avoid any unused film area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.filmanddigitaltimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Anamorphic-Math-FDTimes.pdf |title=Anamorphic Now |accessdate=2014-06-21 |pages=24–31 |issue=53 |magazine=Film and Digital Times |date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Movie camera systems ===
Development of various film camera systems must ultimately cater to the placement of the frame in relation to the lateral constraints of the perforations and the optical soundtrack area. One clever wide screen alternative, [[VistaVision]], used standard 35&amp;nbsp;mm film running sideways through the camera gate, so that the sprocket holes were above and below frame, allowing a larger horizontal negative size per frame as only the vertical size was now restricted by the perforations. There were even a limited number of projectors constructed to also run the print-film horizontally. Generally, however, the 1.50:1 ratio of the initial VistaVision image was optically converted to a vertical print (on standard four-perforation [[35&amp;nbsp;mm film]]) to show with the standard projectors available at theaters, and was then masked in the projector to the US standard of 1.85:1. The format was briefly revived by [[Lucasfilm]] in the late 1970s for special effects work that required larger negative size (due to image degradation from the optical printing steps necessary to make multi-layer composites). It went into obsolescence largely due to better cameras, lenses, and film stocks available to standard four-perforation formats, in addition to increased lab costs of making prints in comparison to more standard vertical processes. (The horizontal process was also adapted to 70&amp;nbsp;mm film by [[IMAX]], which was first shown at the Osaka '70 Worlds Fair.)

[[16&amp;nbsp;mm film|Super 16&amp;nbsp;mm film]] was frequently used for television production due to its lower cost, lack of need for soundtrack space on the film itself (as it is not projected but rather transferred to video), and aspect ratio similar to 16:9 (the native ratio of Super 16&amp;nbsp;mm is 15:9). It also can be blown up to 35&amp;nbsp;mm for theatrical release and therefore is sometimes used for feature films.

== Current video standards ==

=== 1:1 (Square) ===
Square displays are rarely used in devices&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/blackberry_passport-6457.php|title=BlackBerry Passport - Full phone specifications|website=www.gsmarena.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and monitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geek.com/news/eizos-27-inch-3k-display-is-perfectly-square-1610009/|title=Eizo's 27-inch 3K display is perfectly square - Geek.com|date=2014-11-20|work=Geek.com|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, video consumption on social apps has grown rapidly and led to the emergence of new video formats more suited to mobile devices that can be held in horizontal and vertical orientations. In that sense, square video was popularized by mobile apps such as [[Instagram]] and has since been supported by other major social platforms including [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. It can fill nearly twice as much screen space compared to 16:9 format (when the device is held differently while viewing from how video was recorded).

=== 4:3 standard ===
{{main|Fullscreen (filmmaking)}}
4:3 (1.{{overline|3}}:1) (generally read as ''"Four-Three"'', ''"Four-by-Three"'', or ''"Four-to-Three"'') for standard television has been in use since the invention of [[movie camera|moving picture camera]]s and many [[computer monitor]]s used to employ the same aspect ratio. 4:3 was the aspect ratio used for [[35&amp;nbsp;mm film]]s in the [[silent film|silent era]]. It is also very close to the 1.375:1 [[Academy ratio]], defined by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] as a standard after the advent of optical [[sound-on-film]]. By having TV match this aspect ratio, movies originally photographed on 35&amp;nbsp;mm film could be satisfactorily viewed on TV in the early days of the medium (i.e. the 1940s and the 1950s). Since the start of the 21st century broadcasters worldwide are phasing out the 4:3 standard entirely, as manufacturers started to favor the 16:9 aspect ratio of all modern [[high-definition television]] sets and broadcast cameras.

=== 16:9 standard ===
{{Main article|16:9}}
16:9 (1.{{overline|7}}:1) (generally named as ''"Sixteen-by-Nine"'', ''"Sixteen-Nine"'', and ''"Sixteen-to-Nine"'') is the international standard format of [[High-definition television|HDTV]], non-HD digital [[television]] and analog widescreen television [[PALplus]]. Japan's [[Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding|Hi-Vision]] originally started with a 5:3 (= 15:9) ratio but converted when the international standards group introduced a wider ratio of 5⅓ to 3 (= 16:9). Many [[digital video]] cameras have the capability to record in 16:9, and 16:9 is the only widescreen aspect ratio natively supported by the [[DVD-Video#Frame size and frame rate|DVD]] standard. DVD producers can also choose to show even wider ratios such as 1.85:1 and 2.39:1&lt;ref name="anamorphic" /&gt; within the 16:9 DVD frame by [[hard matting]] or adding black bars within the image itself. However, it was used often in British TVs in the [[United Kingdom]] in the 1990s before the 21st century.

=== 1.85:1 ===

When [[movie theater|cinema]] attendance dropped, Hollywood created [[widescreen]] aspect ratios in order to differentiate the film industry from TV. Being one of the most common the 1.85:1 ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.widescreen.org/aspect_ratios.shtml|title=Widescreen.org|last=John|website=www.widescreen.org|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2:1 ===
{{Main article|Univisium}}
The 2:1 aspect ratio was first used in the 1950's for the RKO Superscope format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/wingss1.htm|title=Widescreen Museum - CinemaScope Derivatives - Superscope 1|website=www.widescreenmuseum.com|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vashivisuals.com/the-hot-new-filmmaking-aspect-ratio/|title=The Aspect Ratio of 2.00 : 1 is Everywhere {{!}} VashiVisuals|website=vashivisuals.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1998, cinematographer [[Vittorio Storaro]] has advocated for a format named "[[Univisium]]" that uses an 2:1 format.&lt;ref&gt;Vittorio Storaro, "What is UNIVISIUM?," http://vittoriostoraro-asc.blogspot.com/2007/03/what-is-univisium.html .&lt;/ref&gt; It is designed to be a compromise between the cinema 2.39:1 aspect ratio and the HD-TV broadcast 16:9 ratio. Univisium has gained little traction in the theatrical film market, but has recently been used by [[Netflix]] and [[Amazon Video]] for productions such as ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'' and ''[[Transparent (TV series)|Transparent]]'', respectively. This aspect ratio is standard on the acquisition formats mandated by these content platforms and is not necessarily a creative choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/04/netflix-amazon-4k-documentary-1201799403/|title=What Amazon and Netflix’s Demand for 4K Means for Documentaries|last=O'Falt|first=Chris|date=2017-04-04|work=IndieWire|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, some mobile devices, such as the [[LG G6]], [[LG V30]], [[Huawei Mate 10 Pro]], [[Pixel 2|Google Pixel 2 XL]] and [[Oneplus 5T|OnePlus 5T]], are embracing the 2:1 format (advertised as 18:9), as well as the [[Samsung Galaxy S8]], [[Samsung Galaxy Note 8]], [[Samsung Galaxy S9]] and [[Samsung Galaxy Note 9]] with an slightly similar 18.5:9 format.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel P., "So, what is this 2:1 Univisium display ratio on the LG G6 and likely the S8?," February 26, 2017, http://www.phonearena.com/news/So-what-is-this-21-Univisium-display-ratio-on-the-LG-G6_id90593&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hihonor.com/global/products/smartphone/honor7x/ The official Honor website] displays that it has an 18:9 ratio (visit the gaming tab).&lt;/ref&gt; The Apple [[iPhone X]] also has a similar screen ratio of 19.5:9 (2.16:1).

=== 2.35:1, 2.39:1 or 2.4:1 ===
{{Main article|Anamorphic format}}
Anamorphic format is the [[cinematography]] technique of shooting a [[widescreen]] picture on standard [[35 mm film]] or other visual recording media with a non-widescreen native aspect ratio. When projected, image have an aproximated  2.35:1 or 2.39:1 aspect ratio.

=== Vertical video ===

Another trend arising from the massive use of smartphones is [[Vertical video]] (9:16), that is intended for viewing in [[Page orientation|portrait mode]]. It was popularized by [[Snapchat]] and is also now being adopted by Twitter and Facebook.

== Obtaining height, width, and area of the screen ==
Often, screen specifications are given by their diagonal length. The following formulae can be used to find the height (''h''), width (''w'') and area (''A''), where ''r'' stands for ratio, written as a fraction, and ''d'' for diagonal length.

:&lt;math&gt;h=\frac{d}{\sqrt{r^2+1}} \qquad w=\frac{r*d}{\sqrt{{r^2}+1}}  \qquad A=\frac{r*d^2}{{r^2}+1}&lt;/math&gt;

== Distinctions ==
{{Further|Pixel aspect ratio}}
This article primarily addresses the aspect ratio of images ''as displayed,'' which is more formally referred to as the ''display aspect ratio'' (DAR). In [[digital image]]s, there is a distinction with the ''{{visible anchor|storage aspect ratio}}'' (SAR), which is the ratio of [[pixel dimensions]]. If an image is displayed with [[square pixel]]s, then these ratios agree; if not, then non-square, "rectangular" pixels are used, and these ratios disagree. The aspect ratio of the pixels themselves is known as the [[pixel aspect ratio]] (PAR) – for square pixels this is 1:1 – and these are related by the identity:
:SAR&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;PAR&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;DAR.
Rearranging (solving for PAR) yields:
:PAR&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;DAR/SAR.
For example, a 640&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;480 [[VGA]] image has a SAR of 640/480 = 4:3, and if displayed on a 4:3 display (DAR = 4:3), has square pixels, hence a PAR of 1:1. By contrast, a 720&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;576 [[D-1 (Sony)|D-1]] PAL image has a SAR of 720/576 = 5:4, but is displayed on a 4:3 display (DAR = 4:3), so by this formula it would have a PAR of (4:3)/(5:4) = 16:15.

However, because standard definition digital video was originally based on digitally sampling analog television, the 720 horizontal pixels actually capture a slightly wider image to avoid loss of the original analog picture. In actual images, these extra pixels are often partly or entirely black, as only the center 704 horizontal pixels carry actual 4:3 or 16:9 image. Hence, the actual pixel aspect ratio for PAL video is a little different from that given by the formula, specifically 12:11 for PAL and 10:11 for NTSC. For consistency, the same effective pixel aspect ratios are used even for standard definition digital video originated in digital form rather than converted from analog. For more details refer to the [[Pixel aspect ratio#Analog-to-digital conversion|main article]].

In analog images such as film there is no notion of pixel, nor notion of SAR or PAR, and "aspect ratio" refers unambiguously to DAR. Actual displays do not generally have non-square pixels, though digital sensors might; they are rather a mathematical abstraction used in resampling images to convert between resolutions.

Non-square pixels arise often in early digital TV standards, related to digitalization of analog TV signals – whose horizontal and vertical resolutions differ and are thus best described by non-square pixels – and also in some digital videocameras and computer [[display mode]]s, such as [[Color Graphics Adapter]] (CGA). Today they arise particularly in [[transcoding]] between resolutions with different SARs.

DAR is also known as ''image aspect ratio'' and ''picture aspect ratio'', though the latter can be confused with ''pixel'' aspect ratio.

== Visual comparisons ==
Comparing two different aspect ratios poses some subtleties – when comparing two aspect ratios, one may compare images with equal height, equal width, equal diagonal, or equal area. More amorphous questions include whether particular subject matter has a natural aspect ratio (panoramas being wide, full-length images of people being tall), or whether a particular ratio is more or less aesthetically pleasing, for example the [[golden ratio]] (~1.618).

Televisions and other displays typically list their size by their diagonal. Given the same diagonal, a 4:3 screen has more area compared to 16:9. For CRT-based technology, an aspect ratio that is closer to square is cheaper to manufacture. The same is true for projectors, and other optical devices such as cameras, camcorders, etc. For LCD and plasma displays, however, the cost is more related to the area. Producing wider and shorter screens can yield the same advertised diagonal, but with less area.

The following compares crops of an image at 4:3 and 16:9 ratios, with different dimensions set equal. Note that either image (or both) can be cropped; one aspect doesn't necessarily show more detail than the other.

[[File:Filmaspectratios svg.svg|thumb|300px|Comparison of several film aspect ratios with the heights forced to be equal.]]

* '''1.19:1 (19:16)''': Sometimes referred to as the [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]] ratio, this ratio was used briefly during the transitional period when the film industry was converting to sound, from 1926 to 1932 approx. It is produced by superimposing an optical soundtrack over a full-gate 1.{{overline|3}} aperture in printing, resulting in an almost square image. Films shot in this ratio are often projected or transferred to video incorrectly using a 1.37 mask or squashed to 1.37. Examples of films shot in the Movietone ratio include [[Sunrise (film)|Sunrise]], [[M (1931 film)|M]] and [[Hallelujah! (1929 film)|Hallelujah!]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Eyman, ''The Speed of Sound: Hollywood and the Talkie Revolution, 1926–1930'', New York, Simon &amp; Schuster (1997), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1.25:1 (5:4)''': Once-popular aspect for larger format computer monitors, especially in the guise of mass-produced 17" and 19" LCD panels or 19" and 21" CRTs, using 1280×1024 (SXGA) or similar resolutions. Notably one of the few popular display aspect ratios narrower than 4:3, and one popularised by business (CAD, DTP) rather than entertainment use, as it is well-suited to full-page layout editing. Historically, 5:4 was also the original aspect ratio of early 405-line television broadcasts, which progressed to a wider 4:3 as the idea of broadcasting cinema films gained traction.
* '''1.{{overline|3}}:1 (4:3)''': 35&amp;nbsp;mm original silent film ratio, today commonly known in TV and [[video]] as 4:3. Also standard ratio for [[MPEG-2]] video compression. This format is still used in many personal video cameras today and has influenced the selection or design of other aspect ratios. It is the standard [[Super 35]]mm ratio.
* '''1.37:1''': 16&amp;nbsp;mm standard ratio.
* '''1.375:1 (11:8)''': 35&amp;nbsp;mm full-screen sound film image, nearly universal in movies between 1932 and 1953. Officially adopted as the [[Academy ratio]] in 1932 by [[AMPAS]]. Rarely used in theatrical context nowadays, but occasionally used for other context.
* '''1.43:1''': [[IMAX]] format. IMAX productions use 70&amp;nbsp;mm wide film (the same as used for 70&amp;nbsp;mm feature films), but the film runs through the camera and projector horizontally. This allows for a physically larger area for each image.
* '''1.5:1 (3:2)''': The aspect ratio of 35&amp;nbsp;mm film used for still photography when 8 perforations are exposed. Also the native aspect ratio of [[VistaVision]], for which the film runs horizontally. Used on the [[Chrome OS]]-based [[Chromebook Pixel]] Notebook PC, the [[Game Boy Advance]] portable game console, the [[Surface Pro 3]] [[2-in-1 PC|laplet]] and [[Surface Studio]].
* '''1.{{overline|5}}:1 ([[14:9]])''': Widescreen aspect ratio sometimes used in shooting commercials etc. as a compromise format between 4:3 and 16:9. When converted to a 16:9 frame, there is slight [[pillarbox]]ing, while conversion to 4:3 creates slight [[letterbox]]ing. All widescreen content on [[ABC Family]]'s SD feed until January 2016 were presented in this ratio.
* '''1.6:1 ([[16:10]])''': Widescreen computer monitor ratio (for instance 1920×1200 resolution).
* '''1.{{overline|6}}:1 (5:3)''': 35&amp;nbsp;mm widescreen ratio, originally invented by [[Paramount Pictures]], now a standard among several European countries.{{Which|date=November 2018}} It is also the native Super 16&amp;nbsp;mm frame ratio. Sometimes this ratio is rounded up to 1.6:1. From the late 1980s to the early 2000s, [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]]'s [[Computer Animation Production System|CAPS program]] animated their features in the 1.{{overline|6}}:1 ratio (a compromise between the 1.85:1 theatrical ratio and the 1.{{overline|3}}:1 ratio used for home video), this format is also used on the [[Nintendo 3DS]]'s top screen as well.
* '''1.75:1 (7:4)''': Early 35&amp;nbsp;mm widescreen ratio, primarily used by MGM and Warner Bros. between 1953 and 1955, and since abandoned, though Disney has cropped some of its post-50's Full Screen films to this ratio for DVD, including ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''.
* '''1.{{overline|7}}:1 ([[16:9]] = 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)''': Video widescreen standard, used in [[high-definition television]], one of three ratios specified for [[MPEG-2]] video compression. Also used increasingly in personal video cameras. Sometimes this ratio is rounded up to 1.78:1.
* '''1.85:1''': 35&amp;nbsp;mm US and UK widescreen standard for theatrical film. Introduced by [[Universal Pictures]] in May, 1953. Projects approximately 3 [[film perforations|perforations]] ("perfs") of image space per 4 perf frame; films can be shot in [[Negative pulldown|3-perf]] to save cost of film stock. Also the ratio of Ultra 16&amp;nbsp;mm.
* '''1.896:1''': DCI / SMPTE digital cinema basic resolution container aspect ratio.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Univisium|2:1]]''': Recently popularized by the [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company]]. Original [[SuperScope]] ratio, also used in [[Univisium]]. Used as a flat ratio for some American studios in the 1950s and abandoned in the 1960s. Also used in recent mobile phones such as the [[LG G6]], [[Google Pixel 2 XL]], [[HTC U11|HTC U11+]], and [[Huawei Mate 10 Pro]], while the [[Samsung Galaxy S8]], [[Samsung Galaxy Note 8|Note 8]], and [[Samsung Galaxy S9|S9]] use the similar 18.5:9 ratio.
* '''2.2:1 (11:5)''': 70&amp;nbsp;mm standard. Originally developed for [[Todd-AO]] in the 1950s. Specified in [[MPEG-2]] as 2.21:1, but hardly used.
* '''2.35:1 (47:20)''': 35&amp;nbsp;mm anamorphic prior to 1970, used by [[CinemaScope]] ("'Scope") and early [[Panavision]]. The anamorphic standard has subtly changed so that modern anamorphic productions are actually 2.39,&lt;ref name="anamorphic" /&gt; but often referred to as 2.35 anyway, due to old convention.'' (Note that anamorphic refers to the compression of the image on film to maximize an area slightly taller than standard [[Negative pulldown|4-perf]] [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy]] aperture, but presents the widest of aspect ratios.)'' All Indian [[Bollywood]] films released after 1972 are shot in this standard for theatrical exhibition.
* '''2.37:1 (64:27 = 4&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;:3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)''': TVs were produced with this aspect ratio between 2009 and 2012&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Louis.

* '''2.39:1 (~12:5)''': 35&amp;nbsp;mm anamorphic from 1970 onwards. Aspect ratio of current [[anamorphic widescreen]] theatrical viewings. Often commercially branded as [[Panavision]] format or [[CinemaScope|'Scope]]. Specified as 2.40:1 for [[Blu-ray Disc]] film releases (1920×800 resolution).
* '''2.55:1 (~23:9)''': Original aspect ratio of [[CinemaScope]] before optical sound was added to the film in 1954. This was also the aspect ratio of [[CinemaScope 55]].
* '''2.59:1 (~13:5)''': [[Cinerama]] at full height (three specially captured 35&amp;nbsp;mm images projected side-by-side into one composite widescreen image).
* '''2.{{overline|6}}:1 (8:3)''': [[Full frame]] output from Super 16&amp;nbsp;mm negative when an anamorphic lens system has been used. Effectively, an image that is of the ratio 24:9 is squashed onto the native 15:9 aspect ratio of a Super 16&amp;nbsp;mm negative.
* '''2.76:1 (~11:4)''': [[Ultra Panavision 70]]/[[MGM Camera 65]] (65&amp;nbsp;mm with 1.25× anamorphic squeeze). Used only on a handful of films between 1957 and 1966 and two films in the 2010s, for some sequences of ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962) with a slight crop when converted to three strip [[Cinerama]], and films such as ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963) and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959). [[Quentin Tarantino]] used it for [[The Hateful Eight]] (2015), [[Gareth Edwards (director)|Gareth Edwards]] for [[Rogue One]] (2016), [[Kirill Serebrennikov]] for [[Summer (2018 film)|Summer]] (2018).

* '''4:1''': Rare use of [[Polyvision]], three 35&amp;nbsp;mm 1.{{overline|3}}:1 images projected side by side. First used in 1927 on [[Abel Gance]]'s ''[[Napoléon (1927 film)|Napoléon]]''.
* '''12:1''': [[Circle-Vision 360°]] developed by the [[Walt Disney Company]] in 1955 for use in [[Disneyland]]. Uses nine 4:3 35&amp;nbsp;mm projectors to show an image that completely surrounds the viewer. Used in subsequent Disney theme parks and other past applications.

== Aspect ratio releases ==

=== Original aspect ratio (OAR) ===

''Original Aspect Ratio'' (OAR) is a [[home cinema]] term for the aspect ratio or dimensions in which a [[film]] or visual production was produced – as envisioned by the people involved in the creation of the work. As an example, the film ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' was released to theaters in the 2.39:1 aspect ratio. It was filmed in [[Super 35]] and, in addition to being presented in cinemas and television in the Original Aspect Ratio of 2.39:1, it was also broadcast without the [[matte (filmmaking)|matte]], altering the aspect ratio to the television standard of 1.{{overline|3}}:1. Because of the varied ways in which films are shot, IAR (Intended Aspect Ratio) is a more appropriate term, but is rarely used.

=== Modified aspect ratio (MAR) ===

''Modified Aspect Ratio'' is a home cinema term for the aspect ratio or dimensions in which a film was modified to fit a specific type of screen, as opposed to original aspect ratio. Modified aspect ratios are usually either 1.{{overline|3}}:1 (historically), or (with the advent of widescreen television sets) 1.{{overline|7}}:1 aspect ratio. 1.{{overline|3}}:1 is the modified aspect ratio used historically in VHS format. A modified aspect ratio transfer is achieved by means of [[pan and scan]] or [[open matte]], the latter meaning removing the cinematic matte from a 1.85:1 film to open up the full 1.{{overline|3}}:1 frame. Another name for it is "prescaled" aspect ratio".

== Problems in film and television ==
[[File:Windowboxed.jpg|thumb|right|375px|A [[windowbox (film)|windowboxed]] image]]

Multiple aspect ratios create additional burdens on directors and the public, and confusion among TV broadcasters. It is common for a widescreen film to be presented in an altered format ([[cropping (image)|cropped]], [[letterbox]]ed or expanded beyond the original aspect ratio). It is also not uncommon for [[windowbox (film)|windowboxing]] to occur (when letterbox and pillarbox happen simultaneously). For instance, a 16:9 broadcast could embed a 4:3 commercial within the 16:9 image area. A viewer watching on a standard 4:3 (non-widescreen) television would see a 4:3 image of the commercial with 2 sets of black stripes, vertical and horizontal ([[windowbox (film)|windowboxing]] or the [[Matchboxing#Pillarboxing and gutterboxing|postage stamp]] effect). A similar scenario may also occur for a widescreen set owner when viewing 16:9 material embedded in a 4:3 frame, and then watching that in 16:9. [[Active Format Description]] is a mechanism used in digital broadcasting to avoid this problem. It is also common that a 4:3 image is stretched horizontally to fit a 16:9 screen to avoid [[letterbox|pillar boxing]] but distorts the image so subjects appear short and fat.

Both PAL and NTSC have provision for some data pulses contained within the video signal used to signal the aspect ratio (See ITU-R BT.1119-1 – [[Widescreen signaling]] for broadcasting). These pulses are detected by television sets that have widescreen displays and cause the television to automatically switch to 16:9 display mode. When 4:3 material is included (such as the aforementioned commercial), the television switches to a 4:3 display mode to correctly display the material. Where a video signal is transmitted via a European [[SCART]] connection, one of the status lines is used to signal 16:9 material as well.

== Still photography ==
Common aspect ratios in [[still photography]] include:

* 1:1
* 5:4 (1.25:1)
* 4:3 (1.{{overline|3}}:1)
* 3:2 (1.5:1)
* 5:3 (1.{{overline|6}}:1)
* 16:9 (1.{{overline|7}}:1)
* 3:1

Many digital still cameras offer user options for selecting multiple image aspect ratios. Some achieve this through the use of multi-aspect sensors (notably [[Panasonic]]), while others simply crop their native image format to have the output match the desired image aspect ratio.

=== 1:1 ===

Is the classic Kodak image, and is available as a choice in some digital still cameras, and hearkens back to the days of film cameras when the square image was popular with photographers using twin lens reflex cameras. These medium format cameras used [[120 film]] rolled onto spools. The 6 × 6&amp;nbsp;cm image size was the classic 1:1 format in the recent past. 120 film can still be found and used today. Many [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] [[instant film]]s were designed as square formats. Furthermore, up until August 2015, photo-sharing site [[Instagram]] only allowed users to upload images in 1:1 format. In 2017, Fujifilm added the 1:1 [[Instax#Instax Square|Instax Square]] format to their lineup of instant film cameras.

=== 5:4 ===

Common in large and medium format photography, and still in common use for prints from digital cameras in the 8"×10" size.

=== 4:3 ===
Is used by most digital [[point-and-shoot camera]]s, [[Four Thirds system]], [[Micro Four Thirds system]] cameras and [[medium format]] 645 cameras. The 4:3 digital format popularity was developed to match the then prevailing digital displays of the time, 4:3 computer monitors.

The next several formats have their roots in classic film photography image sizes, both the classic 35&amp;nbsp;mm film camera, and the multiple format [[Advanced Photo System]] ([[Advanced Photo System|APS]]) film camera. The APS camera was capable of selecting any of three image formats, APS-H ("High Definition" mode), APS-C ("Classic" mode) and APS-P ("Panoramic" mode).

=== 3:2 ===
is used by classic [[135 film|35&amp;nbsp;mm film]] cameras using a 24&amp;nbsp;mm × 36&amp;nbsp;mm image size, and their digital derivatives represented by [[DSLR]]s. Typical DSLRs come in two flavors, the so-called professional "full frame" (24&amp;nbsp;mm × 36&amp;nbsp;mm) sensors and variations of smaller, so called "APS-C" sensors. The term "APS" is derived from another film format known as
the [[Advanced Photo System|APS]] and the "-C" refers to "Classic" mode, which exposed images over a smaller area (25.1&amp;nbsp;mm × 16.7&amp;nbsp;mm) but retaining the same "classic" 3:2 proportions as full frame 35&amp;nbsp;mm film cameras.

When discussing DSLR's and their non-SLR derivatives, the term APS-C has become an almost generic term. The two major camera manufacturers [[Canon (company)|Canon]] and [[Nikon]] each developed and established sensor standards for their own versions of APS-C sized and proportioned sensors. Canon actually developed two standards, APS-C and a slightly larger area APS-H (not to be confused with the APS-H film format), while Nikon developed its own APS-C standard, which it calls [[Nikon DX format|DX]]. Regardless of the different flavors of sensors, and their varying sizes, they are close enough to the original APS-C image size, and maintain the classic 3:2 image proportions that these sensors are generally known as an "APS-C" sized sensor.

The reason for DSLR's image sensors being the flatter 3:2 versus the taller point-and-shoot 4:3 is that DSLRs were designed to match the legacy 35&amp;nbsp;mm SLR film, whereas the majority of digital cameras were designed to match the predominant computer displays of the time, with VGA, SVGA, XGA and UXGA all being 4:3. Widescreen computer monitors did not become popular until the advent of [[HDTV]], which uses a 16:9 image aspect ratio.

=== 16:9 ===
16:9 is another format that has its roots in the APS film camera.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Known as APS-H (30.2&amp;nbsp;mm × 16.7&amp;nbsp;mm), with the "-H" denoting "High Definition", the 16:9 format is also the standard image aspect ratio for HDTV. 16:9 is gaining popularity as a format in all classes of consumer still cameras which also shoot High Definition ([[high-definition video|HD]]) [[video]]. When still cameras have an HD video capability, some can also record stills in the 16:9 format, ideal for display on HD televisions and widescreen computer displays.

=== 3:1 ===
is another format that can find its roots in the APS film camera. Known as APS-P (30.2 × 9.5&amp;nbsp;mm), with the -P" denoting "Panorama", the 3:1 format was used for [[panorama]] photography. The APS-P panorama standard is the least adhered to any APS standard, and panoramic implementation varies with by manufacturer on different cameras, with the only commonality being that the image is much longer than it is tall, in the classic "panorama" style.

Common [[Photo print sizes|print sizes]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] (in [[inch]]es) include 4×6 (1.5), 5×7 (1.4), 4×5 and 8×10 (1.25), and 11×14 (1.27); [[large format]] cameras typically use one of these aspect ratios. [[Medium format (film)|Medium-format]] cameras typically have format designated by nominal sizes in centimeters (6×6, 6×7, 6×9, 6×4.5), but these numbers should not be interpreted as exact in computing aspect ratios. For example, the usable height of [[120 film|120-format roll film]] is 56mm, so a width of 70mm (as in 6×7) yields an aspect ratio of 4:5 — ideal for enlarging to make a 8×10" portrait. Print sizes are usually defined by their portrait dimensions (tall) while equipment aspect ratios are defined by their landscape dimensions (wide, flipped sideways). A good example of this a 4×6 print (6&amp;nbsp;inch wide by 4&amp;nbsp;inch tall landscape) perfectly matches the 3:2 aspect ratio of a DSLR/35&amp;nbsp;mm, since 6/2=3 and 4/2=2.

For analog projection of photographic slides, projector and screen use a 1:1 aspect ratio, supporting horizontal and vertical orientation equally well. In contrast, digital projection technology typically supports vertically oriented images only at a fraction of the resolution of landscape-oriented images. For example, projecting a digital still image having a 3:2 aspect ratio on a 16:9 projector employs 84.3% of available resolution in horizontal orientation, but only 37.5% in vertical orientation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1671">'''Bulging factor''' is an [[engineering]] term describing the [[geometry]] of out-of [[plane (geometry)|plane]] [[Deformation (engineering)|deformations]] of the surface of a crack on a [[pressurized]] [[fuselage]] structure.  It is used in evaluating the damage tolerance of [[airframe]] fuselages.&lt;ref name="America. Federal Aviation Administration 2004. pp.1-3"&gt;United States of America. Federal Aviation Administration. Bulging Factor Solutions for Cracks in Longitudinal Lap Joints of Pressurized Aircraft Fuselages. Springfield, 2004. pp.1-3,10&lt;/ref&gt;

The single curved geometry and pressure differential causes a [[Geometric term of location|longitudinal]] crack to bulge out or protrude from the original shape. This change in geometry, or “bulging effect”, significantly increases the [[stress intensity factor]] at the crack tips.  The effects of this [[structural load|loading]] condition can trigger different types of failure mechanisms. 

For the case of unstiffened shell structures, the bulging factor can be defined as the ratio of stress-intensity (SIF) of a curved shell to the stress-intensity factor of a flat panel:

&lt;math&gt;bulging factor = SIF(curved)/SIF(flat)&lt;/math&gt;

The representation of this phenomenon becomes rather complex due to the [[biaxial]] and internal pressure load and structural configuration.&lt;ref name="America. Federal Aviation Administration 2004. pp.1-3" /&gt;

The '''Business Journalist of the Year Awards''' are widely recognised{{whom|date=November 2016}} as the most important global awards for business writers and [[broadcasting|broadcaster]]s. They are the only awards for business writers that are open to [[journalist]]s of all nationalities, and the only awards to cover the entire spectrum of business and financial reporting.

The Business Journalist of the Year Awards (first presented in 1999) were created because [[business information]] had become a global commodity paying little heed to national borders. In a world where goods, services, money and knowledge move ever more freely from one domain to another, the source of business information is no longer relevant - only its quality matters. That's the spirit these awards were created in, and the spirit in which they have grown.

The Business Journalist of the Year Awards are judged exclusively by journalists and governed by the World's leading business editors. The Editors' Committee comprises Martin Dickson, Deputy Editor of the ''[[Financial Times]]''; [[Robert Peston]], business editor at [[BBC|the BBC]]; [[Hugo Dixon]], [[editing|editor-in-chief]] and chairman of [[Breakingviews]]; Jesse Lewis, [[managing editor]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal Europe]]''; and Rik Kirkland, former managing editor of ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''.

{{asof|2018|10}} In October 2018, Canaan announced its newest miner, the 911 which reportedly has performance of 18 Terahash per second and the power consumption of 1440 Watts.&lt;ref name="8btc-911"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.8btc.com/canaan-unveils-new-mining-rig-avalonminer-a911-and-5nm-chip-is-in-layout | first=Connie | last=Wang | date=15 October 2018 | accessdate=18 October 2018 | work=8BTC | title=Canaan Unveils AvalonMiner A911 , and Its 5nm Chip Is In Developmet }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the second miner in the 9 series behind the 921 which is also powered by Canaan's 7 nm process ASIC chips says Canaan representatives.

==Pre-Canaan History==
In 2010, while still pursuing a Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering, Ngzhang discovered [[Bitcoin]]. In November 2011, Ngzhang announced on Bitcointalk the world's first dedicated bitcoin mining hardware named "Icarus" using FPGA technology.&lt;ref name="qi-icarus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.qi-hardware.com/wiki/Icarus | work=Qi Hardware Wiki | date=2012-01-02 | accessdate=2016-06-20 | title=Icarus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The follow-up product came in May 2012 with the second FPGA-based design, the Lancelot.&lt;ref name="qi-lancelot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.qi-hardware.com/wiki/Lancelot | work=Qi Hardware Wiki | date=2012-04-09 | accessdate=2016-06-20 | title=Icarus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, upon the release of Icarus, the Bitcoin community and industry gave much attention to the project. Then Ngzhang founded the Avalon Project as the brand to launch bitcoin mining hardware and Avalon ASIC semiconductors. And, because the software around the chips is open source, many engineers joined the project.&lt;ref name="ng-bitcointalk-avalon-launch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=110090.0 | work=Bitcointalk forum | date=2012-09-17 | accessdate=2016-06-20 | title="Avalon" ASIC, announcement &amp; pre-order. pre-order over. project started.|first=N.G.|last=Zhang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avalon Product Line History==
'''Avalon''' is a Canaan Creative brand and product line offering both bitcoin mining machines and semiconductor chips under the same name. The project was originally created by Zhang Ng, known also as "ngzhang".

By January 2013, the Avalon Project successfully developed the world's first dedicated bitcoin mining ASIC chip, the Avalon1 A3256. A month later, Avalon announced a product, the Avalon1 3module which used the Avalon1 A3256 chip. The Avalon1 had the equivalent [[SHA-256]] algorithm calculating power as the most powerful graphics card at the time, [[Radeon HD 5000 Series#Radeon HD 5900|AMD's HD5970]]&lt;ref name="amd-5970-page"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amd.com/en-us/products/graphics/desktop/5000/5970 | work=AMD Website | date=2016-06-20 | accessdate=2016-06-20 | title=AMD 5970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Test's performed showed that the chip was 110 times more powerful than the previous FPGA calculating power. This also meant that use of graphics card "GPU" bitcoin mining had also been surpassed with the Avalon1.

In August 2013, the Avalon Project launched its second generation of dedicated bitcoin mining ASIC chips, the Avalon2 A3255. Soon after, the "Avalon2 Single" hardware product using a single Avalon2 A3255 chip, was released. Unlike past machines, the Avalon2 does not operate in standalone mode. During the design of the Avalon2, a bottleneck in mining performance was realized with a standalone-only design. Therefore, the Avalon2 also is operated with an external controller so multiple Avalon2 Single units can be operated in parallel to reduce peripheral costs. The mining power in Bitcoin shifted from a single user's running individual mining machines to running Bitcoin mining farms.

In April 2014, the Avalon Project launched the third generation dedicated bitcoin mining chip the Avalon3 A3233 after 1 year and 3 months from its predecessor. In that time, the Bitcoin industry grew around the world. The Avalon Project also launched the Bitcoin hardware product, the Avalon3 using the Avalon3 A3233 ASIC chip and an open source Web-based management software called AMS (Avalon Management System).&lt;ref name="coindesk-avalon40nm" /&gt;

In August 2014, Avalon released the Avalon nano with a single A3233 chip on a small unit one can simply plug into a USB port for power and mining.

By September 2014, the Avalon Project entered advanced IC ([[Integrated circuit]]) design by releasing the Avalon3 A3222 chip using a 28&amp;nbsp;nm ASIC chip manufacturing process.

In October 2014, the Avalon4.0 mining hardware was released using 40 Avalon A3222 chips to bring 1T or 1 Terahashes per second [[SHA-256]] Hashing power.

The latest hardware release came in October 2015 is the Avalon6 which uses 80 updated A3218 Avalon Avalon ASIC chips to achieve a 3.5T hash rate.

==Acquisition history==
The company attempted a reverse acquisition for $466 Millions USD by Shandong Luyitong (LYT), publicly traded company on the Shenzhen stock market.&lt;ref name="lyt-stockmarket"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finance.sina.com.cn/realstock/company/sz300423/ncp.shtml | work=Sina Finance | date=2016-06-20 | accessdate=2016-06-20 | title=Shanghai Luyitong Public Trading Symbol }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lyt-stockmarket-bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/300423:CH-shandong-luyitong-intelligent-electric-plc | work=Bloomberg | date=2016-06-20 | accessdate=2016-06-20 | title=Shandong Luyitong Intelligent Electric Plc}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the acquisition, Canaan Creative would have been a wholly owned sudsidiary at that point.&lt;ref name="coindesk-canaan-acquisition01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-mining-asic-acquired-avalon/ | work=Coindesk News | date=2016-06-08 | accessdate=2016-06-20 | title=Maker of First Bitcoin Mining ASIC Acquired in What Could Be Industry's Largest Sale|first=Stan|last=Higgins }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="finance-magnates-canaan-acquisition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/chinese-bitocin-mining-developer-canaan-acquired-for-%C2%A53-billion/ | work=NEWSBTC | date=2016-06-09 | accessdate=2016-06-20 | title=Chinese Bitcoin Mining Developer Canaan Acquired for ¥3 Billion|first=Avi|last=Mizrahi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public reports stated that, "Luyitong [would have] paid roughly ¥1bn (approximately $152m) in cash, and issued 81 million shares at an average price per share of ¥24.57 ($3.74), representing an additional ¥1.99bn (roughly $303m)."&lt;ref name="finance-magnates-canaan-acquisition" /&gt;&lt;ref name="coindesk-canaan-acquisition02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coindesk.com/sale-of-bitcoin-company-behind-avalon-mining-chip-awaits-government-approval/ | work=Coindesk News | date=2016-06-09 | accessdate=2016-06-20 | title=New Details Emerge on Bitcoin Firm Avalon's $466 Million Pending Sale|first=Stan|last=Higgins }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ccn-canaan-acquisition"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/chinese-bitcoin-mining-firm-canaan-acquired-422-million/ | work=Coindesk News | date=2016-06-10 | accessdate=2016-06-20 | title=Chinese Bitcoin Mining Firm Canaan Acquired for $422 Million|first=Samburaj|last=Das}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newsbtc-canaan-acquisition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/06/09/chinese-bitcoin-mining-company-canaan-sold-466m/ | work=NEWSBTC | date=2016-06-09 | accessdate=2016-06-20 | title=Chinese Bitcoin Mining Company Canaan Sold for $466m|first=JP|last=Buntix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports say that Canaan's "strong sales projections fueled the valuation, and that it anticipated a net profit of $27m for 2016, with expectations of $39m and $53m in 2017 and 2018, respectively."&lt;ref name="coindesk-canaan-acquisition02" /&gt;

The attempted deal was an investment in Canaan's future as noted by founder, N.G.

However, in the end, the deal did not happen as noted by Coindesk. "While Canaan spent time and resources pulling together this deal, those efforts are not wasted. They are contributions to our future. Internally Canaan strengthened its management structure, refreshed our public image, and have our product pipelines flowing to deliver solid reliable and efficient bitcoin technology solutions worldwide," said N.G.

[[File:British cash on delivery cover 1940s.jpg|thumbnail|right|A British cash on delivery [[Registered mail|registered letter]] from 1940s London showing 4s 7d due on delivery.]]
'''Cash on delivery''' ('''COD'''), sometimes called '''collect on delivery''', is the sale of goods by [[mail order]] where [[payment]] is made on delivery rather than in advance. If the goods are not paid for, they are returned to the [[retailer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashondelivery.asp Cash On Delivery – COD] ''[[Investopedia]]'', 2013. Retrieved 28 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the term applied only to payment by cash but as other forms of payment have become more common, the word "cash" has sometimes been replaced with the word "collect" to include transactions by [[check (finance)|check]]s, [[credit card]]s or [[debit card]]s.

==Advantages and disadvantages for retailers==
The advantages of COD for online or mail order retailers are:
*The customer does not need to own a [[credit card]] to purchase
*[[Impulse purchase]]s may increase as payment is not due at the time of ordering
*The credibility of retailers may be increased because the consumer only has to pay when the item is delivered

The principal disadvantage for retailers is that many more orders will be returned as buyers are less committed to the purchase than if they had paid in advance.

==Limits==
Most operators impose a limit on the amount of money that can be collected per delivery or per day using COD services. Limits may be higher for non-cash payments. [[Canada Post]], for instance, applies a limit of C$1000 for cash, but C$5,000 for payment by check or money order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadapost.ca/cpo/mc/personal/productsservices/receive/cod.jsf Collect on Delivery (COD)] Canada Post, 2013. Retrieved 28 December 2013. [https://www.webcitation.org/6MCY3I3rM?url=http://www.canadapost.ca/cpo/mc/personal/productsservices/receive/cod.jsf Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularity in the developing world==
In some countries COD remains a popular option with internet-based retailers, since it is far easier to set up for small businesses and does not require the purchaser to have a credit card. Many small businesses prefer cash payment to credit card payment, as it avoids credit card processing fees. Some shops also offer discounts if paid in cash, because they can offer a better price to the consumer.

The overwhelming majority of e-shopping transactions in the Middle East are COD. 60% of online transactions in the [[UAE]] and Middle East are done by cash on delivery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/blogs/plugged-in/cash-on-delivery-the-biggest-obstacle-to-e-commerce-in-uae-and-region|title=Cash on delivery the biggest obstacle to e-commerce in UAE and region|date=2014-05-14|author=Triska Hamid|publisher=The National}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this has also led to the growth of courier companies offering a COD service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parzel.com/blog/cash-on-delivery-courier-perspective |title=Cash on Delivery : Courier Perspective |date=2014-11-17 |publisher=[[Parzel Express]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214160243/http://www.parzel.com/blog/cash-on-delivery-courier-perspective/ |archivedate=2014-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cryptogram-example.jpg|right|thumb|297px|Example cryptogram. When decoded it reads: "Style and structure are the essence of a book; great ideas are hogwash." -Vladimir Nabokov]]
A '''cryptogram''' is a type of puzzle that consists of a short piece of [[encryption|encrypted]] text.&lt;ref name= "allure"&gt;{{cite news |last=Danesi |first=Marcel |url= https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-workout/201009/cryptograms-and-the-allure-secret-codes |title=Cryptograms and the Allure of Secret Codes |work=[[Psychology Today]] |date=September 22, 2010 |accessdate=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the [[cipher]] used to encrypt the text is simple enough that the cryptogram can be solved by hand. Frequently used are [[substitution cipher]]s where each letter is replaced by a different letter or number. To solve the puzzle, one must recover the original lettering. Though once used in more serious applications, they are now mainly printed for entertainment in newspapers and magazines. 

Other types of [[classical cipher]]s are sometimes used to create cryptograms. An example is the [[book cipher]] where a book or article is used to encrypt a message.

The ''Cryptogram'' is also the name of the periodic publication of the [[American Cryptogram Association]] (ACA), which contains a large number of cryptographic puzzles.

==History of cryptograms==
The ciphers used in cryptograms were not originally created for entertainment purposes, but for real encryption of military or [[privacy|personal secrets]].&lt;ref name="Sutherland"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sutherland |first=Denise w/Koltko-Rivera, Mark |title=Cracking Codes and Cryptograms For Dummies |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-1180-6847-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first use of the cryptogram for entertainment purposes occurred during the Middle Ages by monks who had spare time for intellectual games. A manuscript found at [[Bamberg]] states that Irish visitors to the court of [[Merfyn Frych ap Gwriad]] (died 844), king of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] in [[Wales]] were given a cryptogram which could only be solved by transposing the letters from Latin into Greek.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Around the thirteenth century, the English monk [[Roger Bacon]] wrote a book in which he listed seven cipher methods, and stated that "a man is crazy who writes a secret in any other way than one which will conceal it from the vulgar." In the 19th century [[Edgar Allan Poe]] helped to popularize cryptograms with many newspaper and magazine articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://baltimorepostexaminer.com/edgar-allan-poe-and-cryptography-are-there-hidden-messages-in-eureka/2013/04/27|title=Edgar Allan Poe and cryptography: Are there hidden messages in Eureka?|last=|first=|date=|work=baltimorepostexaminer.com|access-date=2017-09-28|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-known examples of cryptograms in contemporary culture are the syndicated newspaper puzzles Cryptoquip and Cryptoquote, from [[King Features Syndicate|King Features]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://weekly.kingfeatures.com/?team=games-and-puzzles|title=Games and Puzzles {{!}} King Features Weekly Service|website=weekly.kingfeatures.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a public challenge, writer J.M. Appel announced on September 28, 2014, that the table of contents page of his short story collection, ''Scouting for the Reaper'', also doubled as a cryptogram, and he pledged an award for the first to solve it.&lt;ref&gt;"A Challenge," ''Hoosier Topics'', (Cloverdale, IN) Sept 29, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solving a cryptogram==
Cryptograms based on substitution ciphers can often be solved by [[frequency analysis]] and by recognizing letter patterns in words, such as one letter words, which, in English, can only be "i" or "a" (and sometimes "o"). Double letters, apostrophes, and the fact that no letter can substitute for itself in the cipher also offer clues to the solution. Occasionally, cryptogram puzzle makers will start the solver off with a few letters.

==Other crypto puzzles==
While the Cryptogram has remained popular, over time other puzzles similar to it have emerged. One of these is the Cryptoquote, which is a famous quote encrypted in the same way as a Cryptogram. A more recent version, with a biblical twist, is CodedWord. This puzzle makes the solution available only online where it provides a short exegesis on the biblical text. Yet a third is the Cryptoquiz. This puzzle starts off at the top with a category (unencrypted). For example, "Flowers" might be used. Below this is a list of encrypted words which are related to the stated category. The person must then solve for the entire list to finish the puzzle. Yet another type involves using numbers as they relate to texting to solve the puzzle.

The [[Zodiac Killer]] sent four cryptograms to police while he was still active. Despite much research and many investigations, only one of these has been translated, which was of no help in identifying the serial killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/headline-story/16679/zodiac-killer-cipher-amateur-codebreakers/|title=The obsessive amateur code-breakers hoping to crack the Zodiac killer’s cipher|website=kernelmag.dailydot.com|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crypto puzzles in literature and pop culture==

Fiction novels featuring cryptograms include ''The Davinci Code'' by Dan Brown and complex biblical cryptograms in ''Decoding the Phoenix'' by MD TChaves. In non-fiction, ''The Mammoth Book of Secret Codes and Cryptograms: Over 600 Mystery Codes to Be Cracked!'' by Elonka Dunin and many other crypto games reached mainstream prominence following the success of movies such as ''The Davinci Code'' and ''National Treasure: Book of Secrets'' starring Nicolas Cage.

[[Cable railings]] typically use stainless steel cables strung horizontally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Cable Railing Construction | url=http://www.feeneyinc.com/Architectural/CableRail }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glass balusters and glass panels open the view while still providing safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glass Balusters |url=http://www.deckorators.com/balusters/scenic.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024081736/http://www.deckorators.com/balusters/scenic.htm |archivedate=2012-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increasing popularity of [[composite lumber]] for decking, manufacturers are providing composite railing components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Timber Tech Railing | url=http://www.timbertech.com/products/railing-and-lighting/default.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other options include [[wrought iron]] and sheet steel, into which custom designs can be cut.

==Deck railing and building code==
[[Building code]] varies on the national, [[State (polity)|state]], [[county]] and [[municipal]] level. Most areas in the world that use a variation of the [[International Building Code]] require a [[guard rail]] if there is a difference of 30" or more between platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=2006 International Building Code Requirements for Guard Rails | url=http://buildipedia.com/aec-pros/construction-materials-and-methods/guardrails-and-the-building-code }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common requirements are that no space on the railing be greater than that through which a 4" sphere could pass and that the railing assembly be able to withstand a load of 50 pounds per square foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Deck Railing Code Requirements | url=http://www.ironworkinc.com/building_codes.htm }}{{failed verification|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deck railing construction==
[[File:Cable-rail1.jpg|thumb|Cable Railing on Residential Deck overlooking a Lake]]The typical deck railing is generally built from pressure treated lumber. Posts on a deck are also typically pressure treated wood and standard sizes are 4x4, 6x6, and 8x8. These posts give structural support to the railing assembly and are the most critical part for the safety of the guard rail assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Strong Rail-Post Connections for Wooden Decks | url=http://www.dickseibert.com/Woeste.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In between the posts, two 2x4s are attached to the posts with screws for the best connection. The lower board is placed 3.5" from the top of the finish deck to the bottom of the board. The top board is placed with the top at 35" from the deck. Then the vertical 2x2 pressure treated wood [[baluster]]s are installed spaced regularly every 3.5". Then a 2x6 is installed horizontally across the top of the posts and to 2x4. The 2x6 should be fastened with screws to the posts and 2x4 boards for the most rigidity.

[[File:Best-deck-railing.jpg|thumb|Mountain Laurel Railings are curved to match a circular deck on a log home.]]Mountain laurel handrail, glass baluster systems, metal baluster systems, and composite railing systems all install in a similar manner. The differences is in the type of baluster installed. All four of these deck railings can be built using pressure treated lumber, another wood like cedar, or composite lumber to provide the structure.

Wrought iron and other metal railing systems that do not come in ready-to-install kits will usually require a skilled blacksmith as much welding will be required. These sections are typically built off-site in a workshop under controlled conditions, so that installation on the job site can be as speedy as possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3958">'''DMIF''', or '''Delivery Multimedia Integration Framework''', is a uniform interface between the application and the transport, that allows the [[MPEG-4]] application developer to stop worrying about that transport. DMIF was defined in MPEG-4 Part 6 (ISO/IEC 14496-6) in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=34418 | title=ISO/IEC 14496-6:2000 - Information technology -- Coding of audio-visual objects -- Part 6: Delivery Multimedia Integration Framework (DMIF) | author=ISO | publisher=ISO | accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; DMIF defines two interfaces: the DAI (DMIF/Application Interface) and the DNI (DMIF-Network Interface).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/faq/mp4-dmi/mp4-dmi.htm | title=MPEG Systems (1-2-4-7) FAQ, Version 16.0  - Delivery Multimedia Integration Framework (DMIF) |year=2001 | author=MPEG | publisher=MPEG | accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/tutorials/papers/icj-mpeg4-si/06-DMIF_paper/6-DMIF_paper.htm |title=The Delivery Layer in MPEG-4 - G.

MPEG-4 DMIF supports the following functionalities:
* A transparent MPEG-4 DMIF-application interface irrespective of whether the peer is a remote interactive peer, broadcast or local storage media.
* Control of the establishment of FlexMux channels
* Use of homogeneous networks between interactive peers: [[Internet Protocol|IP]], ATM, mobile, [[PSTN]], narrowband [[ISDN]].
* Support for mobile networks, developed together with ITU-T
* UserCommands with acknowledgment messages.
* Management of MPEG-4 Sync Layer information

DMIF expands upon the [[MPEG-2]] [[DSM-CC]] standard (ISO/IEC 13818-6:1998) to enable the convergence of interactive, broadcast and conversational multimedia into one specification which will be applicable to set tops, desktops and mobile stations. The DSM-CC work was extended as part of the ISO/IEC 14496-6, with the ''DSM-CC Multimedia Integration Framework (DMIF)''. DSM-CC stands for ''Digital Storage Media - Command and Control''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/meetings/stockholm/stockholm_press.htm | title=mpeg Press &amp; Public Release - Stockholm | date=July 1997 | author=MPEG | publisher=MPEG | accessdate=2010-08-01 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705170133/http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/meetings/stockholm/stockholm_press.htm | archivedate=2010-07-05 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/faq/mp2-dsm/mp2-dsm.htm |title=DSM-CC FAQ Version 1.0 |date=1997-02-21 |author=MPEG | publisher=MPEG |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/technologies/mpeg-2/mp02-dsm/dsmcc/dsmcc.htm |title=An Introduction to Digital Storage Media - Command and Control (DSM-CC) |date=1996 |author=IEEE | publisher=MPEG |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; DMIF was also a name of working group within Moving Picture Experts Group.

'''Documentation testing''' is part of non-functional testing of a product. It may be a type of [[Black-box testing|black box testing]] that ensures that documentation about how to use the system matches with what the system does, providing proof that system changes and improvement have been documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qatestlab.com/knowledge-center/qa-testing-materials/what-is-documentation-testing/|title=What Is Documentation Testing? – Offshore Software Testing with QATestLab|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Documentation testing includes the plans, results, and testing of a system or system component. It includes test case specifications, test plans, test procedures, test reports, and test logs. It is about the testing of all the documents stating, defining, explaining and reporting or validating requirements, procedures followed and results. Documentation testing starts with the beginning of the very first software process to be most cost effective.&lt;ref name="istqbexamcertification.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://istqbexamcertification.com/what-is-documentation-testing/|title=What is documentation testing in software testing?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documentation testing includes checking the spelling and grammar to review any ambiguity or inconsistency between what functionality it performs and what it is supposed to do.

Product documentation is a critical part of the final product.&lt;ref name="istqbexamcertification.com" /&gt; Poor documentation can affet the product or company reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softwaretestingclass.com/why-documentation-is-important-in-software-testing/|title=Why Documentation is Important in Software Testing? - Software Testing Classes|date=26 November 2013|website=softwaretestingclass.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documentation is about the testing of all the documents created prior and after the testing of software.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~spiros/teaching/SE320/slides/documentation-testing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Any delay in the testing of the document will increase the cost. Some common artifacts about software development and testing can be specified as test cases, test plans, requirements, and traceability matrices.

==Key areas==
Four key areas for testing a document include instructions, examples, messages, and samples. Instructions will be needed to step by step execute the test scenarios for looking errors or their omission. Further examples can be provided to elaborate the GUI components, syntax, commands and interfaces to show executed outputs or pin points. Inconsistencies also needed to be taken care of with errors as they can confuse the users and these ambiguities will cause much damage if the user of the system will be a novice user. Examples will be needed in case of any problem that occurs to the user, particularly novice users who Novice Users will check the documentation for any confusion.

Documentation problems can be handled in formal ways just the same way as the coding problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softwaretestinggenius.com/documentation-testing-an-important-activity-in-software-testing|title=New Post-Documentation Testing an Important Activity in Software Testing|first=Yoginder Nath|last=Gupta|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defect reporting tools and tracking tools are the common solutions for handling defects just like as they are handled in code.

[[File:Ellenroad Mill engines - geograph.org.uk - 2931.jpg|thumb|''Alexandra'', one of the twin preserved steam engines showing the [[rope drive]] flywheel]]
The '''Ellenroad Ring Mill Engine''' is a preserved [[stationary steam engine]] in [[Milnrow]], Greater Manchester. It powered the [[Ellenroad Mill|Ellenroad Ring Mill]] from 1917, and after the mill's closure the engine is still worked under steam as a museum display.

At 3000&amp;nbsp;hp, the twin tandem [[compound steam engine]] is possibly the most powerful of the type in preservation. The two engines are named ''Victoria'' and ''Alexandra'', multiple ropes around the flywheel drove the [[line shaft]]s on each floor of the mill which in turn drove the [[ring spinning]] frames.

In addition to the mill engine, the museum also houses in operational condition the original Ellenroad mill pilot generator engine and sprinkler pump, the Whitelees Beam Engine, and the Marsden Engine. The museum trust also owns the surviving components of the Fern Mill Engine, which it hopes eventually to restore to working condition.

[[File:DHCOM Computer On Module - AM35x.jpg|thumb|right|An ''embedded system'' on a plug-in card with processor, memory, power supply, and external interfaces]]

An '''embedded system''' is a [[RTOS|programmed controlling and operating system]] with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with [[real-time computing]] constraints.&lt;ref name="Barr-glossary"&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Barr|title=Embedded Systems Glossary|work=Neutrino Technical Library|accessdate=2007-04-21|url=http://www.netrino.com/Embedded-Systems/Glossary|authorlink=Michael Barr (software engineer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heath|first=Steve |title=Embedded systems design|publisher=Newnes|year=2003|edition=2|series=EDN series for design engineers|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BjNZXwH7HlkC&amp;pg=PA2|quote= An embedded system is a [[microprocessor]] based system that is built to control a function or a range of functions. | ISBN=978-0-7506-5546-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is ''embedded'' as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts. Embedded systems control many devices in common use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michael Barr|author2=Anthony J. Massa|title=Programming embedded systems: with C and GNU development tools|publisher=O'Reilly|year=2006|pages=1–2|chapter=Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nPZaPJrw_L0C&amp;pg=PA1 | ISBN=978-0-596-00983-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety-eight percent of all [[microprocessor]]s are manufactured components of embedded systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Real men program in C | last=Barr |first=Michael | page=2 | date=1 August 2009 | work=Embedded Systems Design | publisher=TechInsights (United Business Media) | url=http://www.embedded.com/electronics-blogs/barr-code/4027479/Real-men-program-in-C | accessdate=2009-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of properties of typical embedded computers when compared with general-purpose counterparts are low power consumption, small size, rugged operating ranges, and low per-unit cost. This comes at the price of limited processing resources, which make them significantly more difficult to program and to interact with. However, by building intelligence mechanisms on top of the hardware, taking advantage of possible existing sensors and the existence of a network of embedded units, one can both optimally manage available resources at the unit and network levels as well as provide augmented functions, well beyond those available.&lt;ref name="Alippi2014"&gt;C.Alippi: ''Intelligence for Embedded Systems.'' Springer, 2014, 283pp, {{ISBN|978-3-319-05278-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, intelligent techniques can be designed to manage power consumption of embedded systems.&lt;ref&gt;S. Mittal, "[https://www.academia.edu/4186102/A_survey_of_techniques_for_improving_energy_efficiency_in_embedded_computing_systems A survey of techniques for improving energy efficiency in embedded computing systems]", IJCAET, 6(4), 440–459, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern embedded systems are often based on [[microcontroller]]s (i.e. CPUs with integrated memory or peripheral interfaces),&lt;ref name="micro controller"&gt;{{cite web|first=Bill |last=Giovino|title=Micro controller.com – Embedded Systems supersite|url=http://www.microcontroller.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ordinary microprocessors (using external chips for memory and peripheral interface circuits) are also common, especially in more complex systems. In either case, the processor(s) used may be types ranging from general purpose to those specialized in certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand. A common standard class of dedicated processors is the [[digital signal processor]] (DSP).

Since the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks, design engineers can optimize it to reduce the size and cost of the product and increase the reliability and performance. Some embedded systems are mass-produced, benefiting from [[economies of scale]].

Embedded systems range from portable devices such as [[digital watch]]es and [[Digital audio player|MP3 players]], to large stationary installations like [[traffic light]]s, [[Programmable logic controller|factory controllers]], and largely complex systems like [[hybrid vehicles]], [[MRI]], and [[avionics]]. Complexity varies from low, with a single [[microcontroller]] chip, to very high with multiple units, [[peripheral]]s and networks mounted inside a large [[chassis]] or enclosure.

==History==
One of the very first recognizably modern embedded systems was the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]],{{cn|reason=linked article claims it is the first IC-based computer. nothing there supports it being the first embedded system.|date=August 2018}} developed ca. 1965 by [[Charles Stark Draper]] at the [[MIT Instrumentation Laboratory]]. At the project's inception, the Apollo guidance computer was considered the riskiest item in the Apollo project as it employed the then newly developed monolithic integrated circuits to reduce the size and weight. An early mass-produced embedded system was the [[D-17B|Autonetics D-17 guidance computer]] for the [[Minuteman (missile)|Minuteman missile]], released in 1961. When the Minuteman II went into production in 1966, the D-17 was replaced with a new computer that was the first high-volume use of integrated circuits.

Since these early applications in the 1960s, embedded systems have come down in price and there has been a dramatic rise in processing power and functionality. An early [[microprocessor]] for example , the [[Intel 4004]] (released in 1971), was designed for [[calculator]]s and other small systems but still required external memory and support chips. In 1978 National Engineering Manufacturers Association released a "standard" for programmable microcontrollers, including almost any computer-based controllers, such as single board computers, numerical, and event-based controllers.

As the cost of microprocessors and microcontrollers fell it became feasible to replace expensive knob-based [[analog electronics|analog]] components such as [[potentiometer]]s and [[variable capacitor]]s with up/down buttons or knobs read out by a microprocessor even in consumer products. By the early 1980s, memory, input and output system components had been integrated into the same chip as the processor forming a [[microcontroller]]. Microcontrollers find applications where a general-purpose computer would be too costly.

A comparatively low-cost microcontroller may be programmed to fulfill the same role as a large number of separate components. Although in this context an embedded system is usually more complex than a traditional solution, most of the complexity is contained within the microcontroller itself. Very few additional components may be needed and most of the design effort is in the software. Software prototype and test can be quicker compared with the design and construction of a new circuit not using an embedded processor.

==Applications==
[[File:Accupoll-embedded-computer.jpg|thumb|Embedded Computer Sub-Assembly for Accupoll Electronic Voting Machine&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.eff.org/Activism/E-voting/infosheets2006/AccuPollAVS1000.pdf Electronic Voting Machine Information Sheet Accupoll AVS 1000 ]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Embedded systems are commonly found in consumer, cooking, industrial, automotive, medical, commercial and military applications.

Telecommunications systems employ numerous embedded systems from [[telephone switch]]es for the network to [[cell phone]]s at the end user.
Computer networking uses dedicated [[Router (computing)|routers]] and [[network bridge]]s to route data.

[[Consumer electronics]] include [[MP3 player]]s, mobile phones, [[video game console]]s, [[digital camera]]s, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers, and [[computer printer|printers]].
Household appliances, such as [[microwave oven]]s, [[washing machine]]s and [[dishwashers]], include embedded systems to provide flexibility, efficiency and features. Advanced [[HVAC]] systems use networked [[thermostat]]s to more accurately and efficiently control temperature that can change by time of day and [[season]]. [[Home automation]] uses wired- and wireless-networking that can be used to control lights, climate, security, audio/visual, surveillance, etc., all of which use embedded devices for sensing and controlling.

Transportation systems from flight to automobiles increasingly use embedded systems.
New airplanes contain advanced [[avionics]] such as [[inertial guidance system]]s and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers that also have considerable safety requirements.
Various electric motors — [[brushless DC motor]]s, [[induction motor]]s and [[DC motor]]s — use electric/electronic [[motor controller]]s.
[[Automobile]]s, [[electric vehicle]]s, and [[hybrid vehicle]]s increasingly use embedded systems to maximize efficiency and reduce pollution.
Other automotive safety systems include [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS), [[Electronic Stability Control]] (ESC/ESP), [[Traction control system|traction control]] (TCS) and automatic [[four-wheel drive]].

[[Medical equipment]] uses embedded systems for [[vital signs]] monitoring, [[electronic stethoscope]]s for amplifying sounds, and various [[medical imaging]] ([[Positron emission tomography|PET]], [[Single photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]], [[Computed tomography|CT]], and [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]) for non-invasive internal inspections. Embedded systems within medical equipment are often powered by industrial computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/oem-industry-solutions-build-your-product-with-dell Embedded Systems Dell OEM Solutions | Dell]. Content.dell.com (2011-01-04). Retrieved on 2013-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Embedded systems are used in transportation, fire safety, safety and security, medical applications and life critical systems, as these systems can be isolated from hacking and thus, be more reliable, unless connected to wired or wireless networks via on-chip 3G cellular or other methods for IoT monitoring and control purposes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} For fire safety, the systems can be designed to have greater ability to handle higher temperatures and continue to operate. In dealing with security, the embedded systems can be self-sufficient and be able to deal with cut electrical and communication systems.

A new class of miniature wireless devices called [[mote (sensor)|motes]] are networked wireless sensors. Wireless sensor networking, [[WSN]], makes use of miniaturization made possible by advanced IC design to couple full wireless subsystems to sophisticated sensors, enabling people and companies to measure a myriad of things in the physical world and act on this information through IT monitoring and control systems. These motes are completely self-contained, and will typically run off a battery source for years before the batteries need to be changed or charges.

Embedded Wi-Fi modules provide a simple means of wirelessly enabling any device that communicates via a serial port.

==Characteristics==
Embedded systems are designed to do some specific task, rather than be a general-purpose computer for multiple tasks. Some also have [[Real-time computing|real-time]] performance constraints that must be met, for reasons such as safety and usability; others may have low or no performance requirements, allowing the system hardware to be simplified to reduce costs.

Embedded systems are not always standalone devices. Many embedded systems consist of small parts within a larger device that serves a more general purpose. For example, the [[Gibson Robot Guitar]] features an embedded system for tuning the strings, but the overall purpose of the Robot Guitar is, of course, to play music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.embedded.com/underthehood/207401418 Embedded.com – Under the Hood: Robot Guitar embeds autotuning] By David Carey, TechOnline EE Times (04/22/08, 11:10:00 AM EDT)Embedded Systems Design – Embedded.com&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, an embedded system in an [[automobile]] provides a specific function as a subsystem of the car itself.

[[File:ESOM270 eSOM300 Computer on Modules.jpg|thumb|e-con Systems eSOM270 &amp; eSOM300 Computer on Modules]]
The program instructions written for embedded systems are referred to as [[firmware]], and are stored in read-only memory or [[flash memory]] chips. They run with limited computer hardware resources: little memory, small or non-existent keyboard or screen.

===User interface===
[[File:MicroVGA TUI demoapp.jpg|thumb|Embedded system [[text user interface]] using MicroVGA&lt;ref group="nb" name="MicroVGA"&gt;For more details of MicroVGA see this [http://www.microvga.com/pdf/uvga-text-ds.pdf PDF].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Embedded systems range from [[Headless system|no user interface]] at all, in systems dedicated only to one task, to complex [[Desktop operating system#Graphical user interfaces|graphical user interfaces]] that resemble modern computer desktop operating systems.
Simple embedded devices use [[Push-button|buttons]], [[LED]]s, graphic or character [[LCD]]s ([[Hitachi HD44780 LCD controller|HD44780 LCD]] for example) with a simple [[menu (computing)|menu system]].

More sophisticated devices that use a graphical screen with [[touch screen|touch]] sensing or screen-edge buttons provide flexibility while minimizing space used: the meaning of the buttons can change with the screen, and selection involves the natural behavior of pointing at what is desired. [[Mobile device|Handheld systems]] often have a screen with a "joystick button" for a pointing device.

Some systems provide user interface remotely with the help of a serial (e.g. [[RS-232]], [[USB]], [[I²C]], etc.) or network (e.g. [[Ethernet]]) connection. This approach gives several advantages: extends the capabilities of embedded system, avoids the cost of a display, simplifies [[Board support package|BSP]] and allows one to build a rich user interface on the PC. A good example of this is the combination of an [[Embedded HTTP server|embedded web server]] running on an embedded device (such as an [[IP camera]]) or a [[Router (computing)|network router]]. The user interface is displayed in a [[web browser]] on a PC connected to the device, therefore needing no software to be installed.

===Processors in embedded systems===
Embedded processors can be broken into two broad categories. Ordinary microprocessors (μP) use separate integrated circuits for memory and peripherals. Microcontrollers (μC) have on-chip peripherals, thus reducing power consumption, size and cost. In contrast to the personal computer market, many different basic [[CPU architecture]]s are used since software is custom-developed for an application and is not a commodity product installed by the end user. Both [[Von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann]] as well as various degrees of [[Harvard architecture]]s are used. [[RISC]] as well as non-RISC processors are found. Word lengths vary from 4-bit to 64-bits and beyond, although the most typical remain 8/16-bit. Most architectures come in a large number of different variants and shapes, many of which are also manufactured by several different companies.

[[List of common microcontrollers|Numerous microcontrollers]] have been developed for embedded systems use. General-purpose microprocessors are also used in embedded systems, but generally, require more support circuitry than microcontrollers.

====Ready-made computer boards====
[[PC/104]] and PC/104+ are examples of standards for ''ready-made'' computer boards intended for small, low-volume embedded and ruggedized systems, mostly x86-based. These are often physically small compared to a standard PC, although still quite large compared to most simple (8/16-bit) embedded systems. They often use [[DOS]], [[Linux]], [[NetBSD]], or an embedded [[real-time operating system]] such as [[MicroC/OS-II]], [[QNX]] or [[VxWorks]]. Sometimes these boards use non-x86 processors.

In certain applications, where small size or power efficiency are not primary concerns, the components used may be compatible with those used in general purpose x86 personal computers. Boards such as the VIA [[EPIA]] range help to bridge the gap by being PC-compatible but highly integrated, physically smaller or have other attributes making them attractive to embedded engineers. The advantage of this approach is that low-cost commodity components may be used along with the same software development tools used for general software development. Systems built in this way are still regarded as embedded since they are integrated into larger devices and fulfill a single role. Examples of devices that may adopt this approach are [[Automated teller machines|ATMs]] and [[arcade machines]], which contain code specific to the application.

However, most ready-made embedded systems boards are not PC-centered and do not use the ISA or PCI buses. When a [[system-on-a-chip]] processor is involved, there may be little benefit to having a standardized bus connecting discrete components, and the environment for both hardware and software tools may be very different.

One common design style uses a small system module, perhaps the size of a business card, holding high density [[Ball grid array|BGA]] chips such as an [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based [[system-on-a-chip]] processor and peripherals, external [[flash memory]] for storage, and [[Dynamic random access memory|DRAM]] for runtime memory. The module vendor will usually provide boot software and make sure there is a selection of operating systems, usually including [[Linux]] and some real time choices. These modules can be manufactured in high volume, by organizations familiar with their specialized testing issues, and combined with much lower volume custom mainboards with application-specific external peripherals.

Implementation of embedded systems has advanced so that they can easily be implemented with already-made boards that are based on worldwide accepted platforms. These platforms include, but are not limited to, [[Arduino]] and [[Raspberry Pi]].

====ASIC and FPGA solutions====
A common array for very-high-volume embedded systems is the [[system on a chip]] (SoC) that contains a complete system consisting of multiple processors, multipliers, caches and interfaces on a single chip. SoCs can be implemented as an [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC) or using a [[field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA).

===Peripherals===
[[File:SMSC LAN91C110 ethernet chip.jpg|thumb|A close-up of the SMSC LAN91C110 (SMSC 91x) chip, an embedded [[Ethernet]] chip]]

Embedded systems talk with the outside world via [[peripheral]]s, such as:
* Serial Communication Interfaces (SCI): [[RS-232]], [[RS-422]], [[RS-485]], etc.
* Synchronous Serial Communication Interface: [[I2C]], [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]], SSC and ESSI (Enhanced Synchronous Serial Interface)
* [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB)
* Multi Media Cards (SD cards, Compact Flash, etc.)
* Networks: [[Ethernet]], [[LonWorks]], etc.
* [[Fieldbus]]es: [[Controller Area Network|CAN-Bus]], [[Local Interconnect Network|LIN-Bus]], [[PROFIBUS]], etc.
* Timers: [[Phase-locked loop|PLL]](s), Capture/Compare and [[Time Processing Unit]]s
* Discrete IO: aka [[General Purpose Input/Output]] (GPIO)
* Analog to Digital/Digital to Analog ([[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]]/[[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]])
* Debugging: [[JTAG]], [[In-System Programming|ISP]], [[In Circuit Serial Programming (ICSP)|ICSP]], [[Background Debug Mode interface|BDM]] Port, BITP, and DB9 ports.

===Tools===
As with other software, embedded system designers use [[compiler]]s, [[Assembly language|assemblers]], and [[debugger]]s to develop embedded system software. However, they may also use some more specific tools:
* In circuit debuggers or emulators (see next section).
* Utilities to add a checksum or [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRC]] to a program, so the embedded system can check if the program is valid.
* For systems using [[digital signal processing]], developers may use a math workbench to simulate the mathematics.
* System level modeling and simulation tools help designers to construct simulation models of a system with hardware components such as [[processors]], [[memories]], [[Direct memory access|DMA]], [[Interface (computing)|interface]]s, buses and software behavior flow as a state diagram or flow diagram using configurable library blocks. Simulation is conducted to select right components by performing power vs. performance trade-off, reliability analysis and bottleneck analysis. Typical reports that helps designer to make architecture decisions includes application latency, device throughput, device utilization, power consumption of the full system as well as device-level power consumption.
* A model-based development tool creates and simulate graphical data flow and UML state chart diagrams of components like digital filters, motor controllers, communication protocol decoding and multi-rate tasks.
* Custom compilers and linkers may be used to optimize specialized hardware.
* An embedded system may have its own special language or design tool, or add enhancements to an existing language such as [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] or [[BASIC Stamp|Basic]].
* Another alternative is to add a [[real-time operating system]] or [[embedded operating system]]
* Modeling and code generating [[UML tool|tools]] often based on [[UML state machine|state machines]]

Software tools can come from several sources:
* Software companies that specialize in the embedded market
* Ported from the [[GNU]] software development tools
* Sometimes, development tools for a personal computer can be used if the embedded processor is a close relative to a common PC processor

As the complexity of embedded systems grows, higher level tools and operating systems are migrating into machinery where it makes sense. For example, [[cellphone]]s, [[personal digital assistant]]s and other consumer computers often need significant software that is purchased or provided by a person other than the manufacturer of the electronics. In these systems, an open programming environment such as [[Linux]], [[NetBSD]], [[OSGi]] or [[Embedded Java]] is required so that the third-party software provider can sell to a large market.

Embedded systems are commonly found in consumer, cooking, industrial, automotive, medical applications.
Some examples of embedded systems are MP3 players, mobile phones, video game consoles, digital cameras, DVD players, and GPS. Household appliances, such as microwave ovens, washing machines and dishwashers, include embedded systems to provide flexibility and efficiency.

==Debugging==
Embedded [[debugging]] may be performed at different levels, depending on the facilities available. The different metrics that characterize the different forms of embedded debugging are: does it slow down the main application, how close is the debugged system or application to the actual system or application, how expressive are the triggers that can be set for debugging (e.g., inspecting the memory when a particular [[program counter]] value is reached), and what can be inspected in the debugging process (such as, only memory, or memory and registers, etc.).

From simplest to most sophisticated they can be roughly grouped into the following areas:
* Interactive resident debugging, using the simple shell provided by the embedded operating system (e.g. Forth and Basic)
* External debugging using logging or serial port output to trace operation using either a monitor in flash or using a debug server like the [[Remedy Debugger]] that even works for heterogeneous [[Multi-core processor|multicore]] systems.
* An in-circuit debugger (ICD), a hardware device that connects to the microprocessor via a [[JTAG]] or [[Nexus (standard)|Nexus]] interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tancreti|first=Matthew|last2=Hossain|first2=Mohammad Sajjad|last3=Bagchi|first3=Saurabh|last4=Raghunathan|first4=Vijay|date=2011|title=Aveksha: A Hardware-software Approach for Non-intrusive Tracing and Profiling of Wireless Embedded Systems|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2070942.2070972|journal=Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems|series=SenSys '11|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=288–301|doi=10.1145/2070942.2070972|isbn=9781450307185}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the operation of the microprocessor to be controlled externally, but is typically restricted to specific debugging capabilities in the processor. 
* An [[in-circuit emulator]] (ICE) replaces the microprocessor with a simulated equivalent, providing full control over all aspects of the microprocessor.
* A complete [[emulator]] provides a simulation of all aspects of the hardware, allowing all of it to be controlled and modified, and allowing debugging on a normal PC. The downsides are expense and slow operation, in some cases up to 100 times slower than the final system.
* For SoC designs, the typical approach is to verify and debug the design on an FPGA prototype board. Tools such as Certus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eejournal.com/archives/articles/20121030-tektronix/ | title=Tektronix Shakes Up Prototyping, Embedded Instrumentation Boosts Boards to Emulator Status| publisher=Electronic Engineering Journal | date= 2012-10-30|accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; are used to insert probes in the FPGA RTL that make signals available for observation. This is used to debug hardware, firmware and software interactions across multiple FPGA with capabilities similar to a logic analyzer.
* Software-only debuggers have the benefit that they do not need any hardware modification but have to carefully control what they record in order to conserve time and storage space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tancreti|first=Matthew|last2=Sundaram|first2=Vinaitheerthan|last3=Bagchi|first3=Saurabh|last4=Eugster|first4=Patrick|date=2015|title=TARDIS: Software-only System-level Record and Replay in Wireless Sensor Networks|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2737095.2737096|journal=Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks|series=IPSN '15|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=286–297|doi=10.1145/2737095.2737096|isbn=9781450334754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless restricted to external debugging, the programmer can typically load and run software through the tools, view the code running in the processor, and start or stop its operation. The view of the code may be as [[High-level programming language|HLL]] [[source-code]], [[assembly code]] or mixture of both.

Because an embedded system is often composed of a wide variety of elements, the debugging strategy may vary. For instance, debugging a software- (and microprocessor-) centric embedded system is different from debugging an embedded system where most of the processing is performed by peripherals (DSP, FPGA, and co-processor).
An increasing number of embedded systems today use more than one single processor core. A common problem with multi-core development is the proper synchronization of software execution. In this case, the embedded system design may wish to check the data traffic on the busses between the processor cores, which requires very low-level debugging, at signal/bus level, with a [[logic analyzer]], for instance.

===Tracing===

Real-time operating systems ([[RTOS]]) often supports [[tracing (software)|tracing]] of operating system events. A graphical view is presented by a host PC tool, based on a recording of the system behavior. The trace recording can be performed in software, by the RTOS, or by special tracing hardware. RTOS tracing allows developers to understand timing and performance issues of the software system and gives a good understanding of the high-level system behaviors. Commercial tools like [[RTXC Quadros]] or [[IAR Systems]] exists.

===Reliability===
Embedded systems often reside in machines that are expected to run continuously for years without errors, and in some cases recover by themselves if an error occurs. Therefore, the software is usually developed and tested more carefully than that for personal computers, and unreliable mechanical moving parts such as disk drives, switches or buttons are avoided.

Specific reliability issues may include:
* The system cannot safely be shut down for repair, or it is too inaccessible to repair. Examples include space systems, undersea cables, navigational beacons, bore-hole systems, and automobiles.
* The system must be kept running for safety reasons. "Limp modes" are less tolerable. Often backups are selected by an operator. Examples include aircraft navigation, reactor control systems, safety-critical chemical factory controls, train signals.
* The system will lose large amounts of money when shut down: Telephone switches, factory controls, bridge and elevator controls, funds transfer and market making, automated sales and service.

A variety of techniques are used, sometimes in combination, to recover from errors—both software bugs such as [[memory leak]]s, and also [[soft error]]s in the hardware:
* [[watchdog timer]] that resets the computer unless the software periodically notifies the watchdog subsystems with redundant spares that can be switched over to software "limp modes" that provide partial function
* Designing with a [[Trusted Computing Base]] (TCB) architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://c59951.r51.cf2.rackcdn.com/5557-528-heiser.pdf |title=Your System is secure? Prove it! |first1=Gernot |last1=Heiser |date=December 2007 |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=35–8 |journal=[[;login:]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ensures a highly secure &amp; reliable system environment
* A [[hypervisor]] designed for embedded systems, is able to provide secure encapsulation for any subsystem component, so that a compromised software component cannot interfere with other subsystems, or privileged-level system software &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moratelli|first1=C|last2=Johann|first2=S|last3=Neves|first3=M|last4=Hessel|first4=F|title=Embedded virtualization for the design of secure IoT applications|journal=2016 International Symposium on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP)|date=2016|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.libproxy2.usc.edu/document/7909116/|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This encapsulation keeps faults from propagating from one subsystem to another, improving reliability. This may also allow a subsystem to be automatically shut down and restarted on fault detection.
* [[Immunity Aware Programming]]

===High vs. low volume===
For high volume systems such as [[Digital audio player|portable music players]] or [[mobile phone]]s, minimizing cost is usually the primary design consideration. Engineers typically select hardware that is just “good enough” to implement the necessary functions.

For low-volume or prototype embedded systems, general purpose computers may be adapted by limiting the programs or by replacing the operating system with a [[real-time operating system]].

==Embedded software architectures==
{{Main article|Embedded software}}

There are several different types of software architecture in common use.

===Simple control loop===
In this design, the software simply has a [[loop (computing)|loop]]. The loop [[subroutine|calls subroutines]], each of which manages a part of the hardware or software. Hence it is called a simple control loop or control loop.

===Interrupt-controlled system===
Some embedded systems are predominantly controlled by [[interrupt]]s. This means that tasks performed by the system are triggered by different kinds of events; an interrupt could be generated, for example, by a timer in a predefined frequency, or by a serial port controller receiving a byte.

These kinds of systems are used if event handlers need low latency, and the event handlers are short and simple. Usually, these kinds of systems run a simple task in a main loop also, but this task is not very sensitive to unexpected delays.

Sometimes the interrupt handler will add longer tasks to a queue structure. Later, after the interrupt handler has finished, these tasks are executed by the main loop. This method brings the system close to a multitasking kernel with discrete processes.

===Cooperative multitasking===
A [[nonpreemptive multitasking]] system is very similar to the simple control loop scheme, except that the loop is hidden in an [[Application programming interface|API]].&lt;ref name="Barr-glossary" /&gt; The programmer defines a series of tasks, and each task gets its own environment to “run” in. When a task is idle, it calls an idle routine, usually called “pause”, “wait”, “yield”, “nop” (stands for ''no operation''), etc.

The advantages and disadvantages are similar to that of the control loop, except that adding new software is easier, by simply writing a new task, or adding to the queue.

===Preemptive multitasking or multi-threading===
In this type of system, a low-level piece of code switches between tasks or threads based on a timer (connected to an interrupt). This is the level at which the system is generally considered to have an "operating system" kernel. Depending on how much functionality is required, it introduces more or less of the complexities of managing multiple tasks running conceptually in parallel.

As any code can potentially damage the data of another task (except in larger systems using an [[Memory management unit|MMU]]) programs must be carefully designed and tested, and access to shared data must be controlled by some synchronization strategy, such as [[message queue]]s, [[semaphore (programming)|semaphores]] or a [[non-blocking synchronization]] scheme.

Because of these complexities, it is common for organizations to use a [[real-time operating system]] (RTOS), allowing the application programmers to concentrate on device functionality rather than operating system services, at least for large systems; smaller systems often cannot afford the overhead associated with a ''generic'' real-time system, due to limitations regarding memory size, performance, or battery life. The choice that an RTOS is required brings in its own issues, however, as the selection must be done prior to starting to the application development process. This timing forces developers to choose the embedded operating system for their device based upon current requirements and so restricts future options to a large extent.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://www.clarinox.com/docs/whitepapers/Whitepaper_06_CrossPlatformDiscussion.pdf
|title= Working across Multiple Embedded Platforms
|publisher=clarinox
|accessdate=2010-08-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restriction of future options becomes more of an issue as product life decreases. Additionally the level of complexity is continuously growing as devices are required to manage variables such as serial, USB, TCP/IP, Bluetooth, Wireless LAN, trunk radio, multiple channels, data and voice, enhanced graphics, multiple states, multiple threads, numerous wait states and so on. These trends are leading to the uptake of [[embedded middleware]] in addition to a real-time operating system.

===Microkernels and exokernels===
A [[microkernel]] is a logical step up from a real-time OS. The usual arrangement is that the operating system kernel allocates memory and switches the CPU to different threads of execution. User mode processes implement major functions such as file systems, network interfaces, etc.

In general, microkernels succeed when the task switching and intertask communication is fast and fail when they are slow.

[[Exokernel]]s communicate efficiently by normal subroutine calls. The hardware and all the software in the system are available to and extensible by application programmers.

===Monolithic kernels===
In this case, a relatively large kernel with sophisticated capabilities is adapted to suit an embedded environment. This gives programmers an environment similar to a desktop operating system like [[Linux]] or [[Microsoft Windows]], and is therefore very productive for development; on the downside, it requires considerably more hardware resources, is often more expensive, and, because of the complexity of these kernels, can be less predictable and reliable.

Common examples of embedded monolithic kernels are [[embedded Linux]] and [[Windows CE]].

Despite the increased cost in hardware, this type of embedded system is increasing in popularity, especially on the more powerful embedded devices such as [[wireless router]]s and [[Automotive navigation system|GPS navigation systems]]. Here are some of the reasons:
* Ports to common embedded chip sets are available.
* They permit re-use of publicly available code for [[device driver]]s, [[web server]]s, [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]], and other code.
* Development systems can start out with broad feature-sets, and then the distribution can be configured to exclude unneeded functionality, and save the expense of the memory that it would consume.
* Many engineers believe that running application code in user mode is more reliable and easier to debug, thus making the development process easier and the code more portable.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}
* Features requiring faster response than can be guaranteed can often be placed in [[Programmable logic device|hardware]].

===Additional software components===
In addition to the core operating system, many embedded systems have additional upper-layer software components. These components consist of networking protocol stacks like [[Controller–area network|CAN]], [[TCP/IP]], [[FTP]], [[HTTP]], and [[HTTPS]], and also included storage capabilities like [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] and flash memory management systems. If the embedded device has audio and video capabilities, then the appropriate drivers and codecs will be present in the system. In the case of the monolithic kernels, many of these software layers are included. In the RTOS category, the availability of the additional software components depends upon the commercial offering.

'''Flowgorithm''' is a graphical [[authoring tool]] which allows users to write and execute programs using [[flowchart]]s. The approach is designed to emphasize the algorithm rather than the syntax of a specific programming language.&lt;ref name=paper&gt;{{cite web|title=ASEE PSW-2015 Conference Proceedings|url=http://psw.asee.org/AnnualConference/asee-psw2015ConfProceedings.pdf|page=158|website=asee.org|accessdate=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flowchart can be converted to several major programming languages. Flowgorithm was created at [[Sacramento State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kourouma|first1=Mathieu|title=Capabilities and Features of Raptor, Visual Logic, and Flowgorithm for Program Logic and Design|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309354785_Capabilities_and_Features_of_Raptor_Visual_Logic_and_Flowgorithm_for_Program_Logic_and_Design|website=ResearchGate|accessdate=16 July 2017|date=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of name==
The name is a [[portmanteau]] of "[[flowchart]]" and "[[algorithm]]".&lt;ref name=info&gt;{{cite web|title=Info|url=http://www.flowgorithm.org/about/info.htm|website=Flowgorithm|accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supported Programming Languages==
Flowgorithm can interactively translate flowchart programs into [[source code]] written in other programming languages. As the user steps through their flowchart, the related code in the translated program is automatically highlighted. The following programming languages are supported:&lt;ref name=features&gt;{{cite web|title=Features|url=http://www.flowgorithm.org/about/features.htm|website=Flowgorithm|accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7824">[[File:Foucault-Test 1.png|thumb|right|500px|Foucault test setup to measure a mirror]]

The '''Foucault knife-edge test''' was described in 1858 by French physicist [[Léon Foucault]] to measure conic shapes of optical mirrors, with error&lt;ref&gt;Texereau 1984 pp.68-70 section 2.25&lt;/ref&gt; margins measurable in fractions of [[wavelength]]s of light (or [[Angstroms]], millionths of an [[inch]], or [[nanometer]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Texereau 1984 p.70 section 2.26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Sacek| first = Vladimir| authorlink = | title = 4.5.2. Foucault test| work = Notes on AMATEUR TELESCOPE OPTICS| publisher = Vladimir Sacek| date = 14 July 2006| url = http://www.telescope-optics.net/foucault_test.htm| doi = | accessdate = 18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly used by amateur telescope makers for [[figuring]] small [[Primary mirror|astronomical mirrors]].  Its relatively simple, inexpensive apparatus can produce measurements more cost-effectively than most other testing techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Texereau 1984 pp. 55-61 section 2.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Harbour| first = David A| authorlink = | title = Understanding Foucault: A Primer for Beginners (Second Edition)| work = | publisher = The ATM's Workshop| date = July 2001| url = http://www.atm-workshop.com/foucault.html| doi = | accessdate = 18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It measures mirror surface dimensions by reflecting light into a knife edge at or near the mirror's centre of curvature. In doing so, it only needs a tester which in its most basic 19th century form consists of a [[light bulb]], a piece of tinfoil with a pinhole in it, and a razor blade to create the knife edge. The testing device is adjustable along the X-axis (knife cut direction) across the Y-axis ([[optical axis]]), and must have measurable adjustment to 0.001&amp;nbsp;inch (25&amp;nbsp;µm) or better along lines parallel to the optical axis.&lt;ref name="Harbour39"&gt;Harbour 2008 p 39&lt;/ref&gt; According to Texereau it amplifies mirror surface defects by a factor of one million, making them easily accessible to study and remediation.&lt;ref&gt;Texereau 1984 pp. 57 section 2.21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foucault test basics==

[[File:Foucault-Test 2 rotated.jpg|thumb|left|150px| From top: Parabolic mirror showing Foucault shadow patterns made by knife edge inside radius of curvature R (red X), at R and outside R.]]

The mirror to be tested is placed vertically in a stand. The Foucault tester is set up at the distance of the mirror's radius of curvature (radius R is twice the focal length.) with the pinhole to one side of the centre of curvature (a short vertical slit parallel to the knife edge can be used instead of the pinhole). The tester is adjusted so that the returning beam from the pinhole light source is interrupted by the knife edge.

Viewing the mirror from behind the knife edge shows a pattern on the mirror surface. If the mirror surface is part of a perfect sphere, the mirror appears evenly lighted across the entire surface. If the mirror is spherical but with defects such as bumps or depressions, the defects appear greatly magnified in height.  If the surface is [[Parabola|paraboloidal]], the mirror usually looks like a doughnut or lozenge although the exact appearance depends on the exact position of the knife edge.

It is possible to calculate how closely the mirror surface resembles a perfect parabola by placing a [[André Couder|Couder]] mask,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmsite.org/contrib/Carlin/couder/ Designing and calculating Couder screens for Foucault testing] Ken Slater and Nils Olof Carlin&lt;/ref&gt; Everest pin stick (after A. W. Everest)&lt;ref&gt;[http://stellafane.org/tm/atm/test/mask.html Stellafane ATM Build a Couder Mask; Build an Everest Pin Stick]&lt;/ref&gt; or other zone marker&lt;ref name="Harbour49-51"&gt;Harbour 2008 pp 49-51&lt;/ref&gt; over the mirror. A series of measurements with the tester, finding the radii of curvature of the zones along the optical axis of the mirror (Y-axis). These data are then reduced and graphed against an ideal parabolic curve.

===Other testing techniques===
{{main|Ronchi test|Interferometry}}

A number of other tests are used which measure the mirror at the center of curvature. Some telescope makers use a variant of the Foucault test called a Ronchi test that replaces the knife edge with a grating (similar to a very coarse [[diffraction grating]]) comprising fine parallel wires, an etching on a glass plate, a photograph negative or computer printed transparency. Ronchi test patterns are matched to those of standard mirrors or generated by computer.

Other variants of the Foucault test include the Gaviola or [[Caustic test]] which can measure mirrors of fast [[F-number#Focal ratio in telescopes|f/ratio]] more accurately than the Foucault test which is limited to about (λ/8) [[wavelength]] accuracy on small and medium-sized mirrors. The Caustic test is capable of measuring larger mirrors and achieving a (λ/20) wave peak to valley accuracy by using a testing stage which is adjusted from side to side so as to measure each zone of each side of the mirror from the center of its curvature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Baldwin| first = Jeff| authorlink = | title = The Caustic Test| work = Valley Skies| publisher =  Stockton Astronomical Society| date = September 2000| url = http://stocktonastro.org/Newsletter/TTN_CausticTest.html| doi = | accessdate = January 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Dall null test'' uses a plano-convex lens placed a short distance in front of the pinhole.  With the correct positioning of the lens, a parabolic mirror appears flat under testing instead of doughnut-shaped so testing is much easier and zonal measurements are not needed.[http://www.atm-workshop.com/dall-null.html]

There are a number of [[Interferometry|interferometric]] tests which have been used including the [[Twyman–Green interferometer|Michelson-Twyman]] and the [[Michelson interferometer|Michelson]] method, both published in 1918, the Lenouvel method and the [[Fizeau interferometer|Fizeau]] method. Interferometric testing has been made more affordable in recent years by affordable lasers, digital cameras (such as webcams), and computers, but remains primarily an industrial methodology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9397">A '''guard tour patrol system''' is a system for logging the rounds of employees in a variety of situations such as [[security guard]]s patrolling property, technicians monitoring climate-controlled environments, and [[corrections officer|correctional officers]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metrokc.gov/budget/2006/cip/LSJ.pdf Paper on Law, Safety and Justice Capital Improvement Program, King County Washington, Page 6]&lt;/ref&gt; checking prisoner living areas. It helps ensure that the employee makes his or her appointed rounds at the correct intervals and can offer a record for legal or insurance reasons. Such systems have existed for many years using mechanical [[watchclock]]-based systems (watchman clocks/guard tour clocks/patrol clocks). Computerized systems were first introduced in Europe in the early 1980s, and in North America in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=Bill |author2=Robert R. Macdonald |date=March 1991 |title= High-Tech Touring |journal=Security Management |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern systems are based on handheld [[data logger]]s and [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] sensors.
The system provides a means to record the time when the employee reaches certain points on their tour. Checkpoints or watchstations are commonly placed at the extreme ends of the tour route and at critical points such as [[bank vault|vaults]], [[Laboratory specimen|specimen]] [[refrigerators]], vital equipment, and access points. Some systems are set so that the interval between stations is timed so if the employee fails to reach each point within a set time, other staff are dispatched to ensure the employee's well-being.
An example of a modern set-up might work as follows: the employee carries a portable electronic sensor (PES) or electronic data collector which is activated at each checkpoint. Checkpoints can consist of [[iButton]] semiconductors, magnetic strips, proximity microchips such as [[RFID]]s or NFC- or optical [[barcodes]]. The data collector stores the serial number of the checkpoint with the date and time. Later, the information is downloaded from the collector into a computer where the checkpoint's [[serial number]] will have an assigned location (i.e. North Perimeter Fence, Cell Number 1, etc.). Data collectors can also be programmed to ignore duplicate checkpoint activations that occur sequentially or within a certain time period. Computer software used to compile the data from the collector can print out summaries that pinpoint missed checkpoints or patrols without the operator having to review all the data collected. Because devices can be subject to misuse, some have built-in microwave, g-force, and voltage detection.

==System composition==
It combines readers, tags and software.

===Guard patrol reader===
The first Guard tour system were the touch readers with software. Upon further development, more working modes for the readers became available. Such as [[RFID]] and [[GPS]]. And the communication of readers and software was connected with USB cables or download stations. For USB connection, the ''Pogo Pin'' connection is very popular. Because the contacts with gold-plating are very stable and waterproof.

Newer, light-weight guard touring systems utilize QR codes or barcodes rather than expensive electronic components. A mobile phone app is used to scan (take a photo) of the QR code which creates a time stamp in the system.

===Guard patrol tags===
The reader needs to read the tags to record the information, such as the time and tag's ID. Then upload the information to software to get the report.
* Guard ID tags: there are touch ibuttons or RFID tags. The guard ID tags replace the name of guard.
* Checkpoint tags: there are touch ibuttons or RFID tags. The checkpoint tags replace the checkpoints which guards need to patrol.
* Event wallets: there are many event tags in it. And they are touch ibuttons or RFID tags. Each tag means one event thing. When the reader reads the tag, it will get the event. For example, fire, stolen, broken.
* QR Codes:some systems use QR codes or barcodes instead of electronic tags and the associated readers. The codes are often printed on stickers which can be easily placed nearly anywhere, changed (to ensure accountability) or added to change touring routes.

===Guard patrol software===
There are three types of guard patrol software. They are desktop, local network client-server, and web-based versions. 
The desktop version can only work on one computer.
The local network client server type can work using the local area network.
The web-based version can work everywhere with internet access.
In the analog age, the device used for this purpose was the watchclock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watchclocks.org/ The Detex Watchman's Clock Album], Philip Haselton. Accessed May 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Watchclocks often had a paper or light cardboard disk placed inside for each 24-hour period. The user would carry the clock to each checkpoint, where a numbered key could be found (typically chained in place). The key would be inserted into the clock where it would imprint the disk. At the end of the shift or 24-hour period an authorized person (usually a supervisor) would unlock the watchclock and retrieve the disk.
As development of guard tour system, the device can work with more functions. Such as send data real-time by [[GPRS]] to software and [[GPS]] location and tracking mode.
In software, we set up the Patrol Department, Patrol Route, Guard, Checkpoint, Event and Patrol Plan in general, depending on the software purchased. The software will then have specific tours set for officers to complete, being able to indicate whether the inspection was completed properly or not, with the ability to note a specific temperature of an inspection, or make any kind of notes necessary. Guard Tour software systems seem to be becoming the norm in tracking tours for officers. Examples of this software would be the Guard Tour System by Silvertrac Software,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silvertracsoftware.com/ Silvertrac Software]&lt;/ref&gt; SequriX,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sequrix.com/ SequriX]&lt;/ref&gt; Trackforce,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trackforce.com/ Trackforce]&lt;/ref&gt; QR-Patrol,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.qrpatrol.com/ QR-Patrol]&lt;/ref&gt; Kugadi,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kugadi.com/ Kugadi]&lt;/ref&gt; GigaTrak &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gigatrak.com/software/guard_tour_system.aspx GigaTrak]&lt;/ref&gt; TrackTik,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tracktik.com/ TrackTik]&lt;/ref&gt; PatrolLIVE,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patrollive.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Orna,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kerkton.com Orna]&lt;/ref&gt; Guarnic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.guarnic.com Guarnic]&lt;/ref&gt; GuardMetrics&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.GuardMetrics.com/security-guard-tour-system/ GuardMetrics]&lt;/ref&gt; and Youtility&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtility.in/guard-tour Youtility]&lt;/ref&gt;

New touring solutions rely on [[Cloud computing|cloud-based]] Software as a Service (SaaS) combined with mobile or fixed on-site devices. These offer the advantages of lower installation and maintenance costs, forgoing the need for hardware, software upgrades, data backups and computer maintenance. On-site systems need all the usual software patches, backups and periodic hardware replacement. In operation, the role of the watchclock system, described above, has largely been replaced by some combination of [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], [[Radio-frequency identification | RFID/NFC]], or [[QR code | QR coded labels]]. Users prove that they have visited particular locations or performed tasks by scanning these tags or via GPS generated maps. These technologies result in lower costs, while increasing the flexibility of the systems to handle changes or new uses. This is important when routes change, or if a solution is needed on short notice. Tag-based touring systems typically utilize a mobile phone or tablet app to scan the tags and then upload that information along with a time stamp, phone's location information, and optionally other information the guard enters into the app on the phone. These systems provide instant access to tour information as it is uploaded by the application or device carried by the user, rather than requiring the officer to return to an upload station.&lt;ref&gt;Summarizes product descriptions gathered from companies offering these systems in references 4-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usages==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
Although this technology was initially developed for the security market, there are other uses. Some include:

* Public transport time table verification
* Hotel and hospital housekeeping logging
* Verification of patients being attended in hospitals by nursing staff
* Provide due diligence reports for retail slip &amp; fall liability reduction
* Monitoring staff working outside of normal business hours

==Criticisms==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}

For routes which have significant outdoor exposure [[GPS]] units have proven to be an effective means of tracking security and law enforcement patrol behavior. GPS systems do not function in the most vulnerable areas such as indoors or underground. Accordingly, systems using assisted GPS have been developed.

'''High frequency vibrating screens''' are the most important screening machines primarily utilised in the [[mineral processing]] industry. They are used to separate feeds containing solid and crushed ores down to approximately 200μm in size, and are applicable to both perfectly wetted and dried feed. The frequency of the screen is mainly controlled by an electromagnetic vibrator which is mounted above and directly connected to the screening surface. Its high frequency characteristics differentiates it from a normal vibrating screen. The high frequency vibrating screens usually operates at an inclined angle, traditionally varying between 0 and 25 degrees and can go up to a maximum of 45 degrees. Besides, it should operate at a low stroke and has a frequency ranging from 1500 - 7200 RPM.

Pre-treatment of the feed is often required before the use of the high frequency screen as the apertures in the screen may become blocked easily.

==Range of applications==
High frequency screens have become more standardized and widely adopted in materials classification processes. It allows efficient cuts and fine separations, which can provide high purity and precise sizing control of the product (for sizes of fine particles up to 0.074-1.5mm).&lt;ref&gt;China Suppliers, High efficiency,(2013),Mineral Processing High Frequency Vibrating Screen for Fine Iron Ore, http://hcmining.en.made-in-china.com/product/aMGQVdYobCRb/China-High-Efficiency-Mineral-Processing-High-Frequency-Vibrating-Screen-for-Fine-Iron-Ore.html, Last accessed: 1 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Common industrial applications include dewatering of materials, processing of powder in coal, ores and minerals, wood pelleting, fractionated [[Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP)|reclaimed asphalt pavement]], food, [[pharmaceutical]] and [[chemical industry]]. Fineness of the products and system capacities varies over a huge range between different models, to satisfy individual application requirements.

=== Fractionated reclaimed asphalt pavement ===
Most commonly, high frequency screens are used to separate "reclaimed" asphalt pavement (RAP) into multiple sizes and fractions, which allow producers to take full advantage of the recycled materials. RAP is a recycle material that is reused in new pavement construction; any recycled products are worth as much as what they replace.&lt;ref&gt;KPI-JCI and Astec Industries Inc.,(2013),Fractionated Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement,http://www.befrapready.com/frap-advantage/frequently-asked-questions/index.php, Last accessed: 28 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; As compared to conventional screening methods which are limited to producing unacceptable sizes in the products, high frequency screens can produce more efficient sizing to obtain a finer product. Another advantage of using high frequency screens to recycle the reclaimed materials is the available aggregate and oil that can be reused, and reducing the amount of new material required. Therefore, the capital cost for the process is lowered while maintaining a high quality of the asphalt mixture. Moreover, high frequency screen applies intensive vibration directly onto the screen media, such high RPM allows asphalt pavement material to achieve a higher [[wikt:stratification|stratification]] and separate at a faster rate.&lt;ref&gt;KPI-JCI and Astec Industries Inc.,(2013),High Frequency Screen, Mobile Screens Sales Sheet&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mineral processing===
In mineral processing such as ferrous metals ore (e.g. iron, tin, tungsten, tantalum etc.) and nonferrous metals ores (e.g. lead, zinc, gold, silver and industrial sand etc.), high frequency screens have a crucial role. After the ores get comminuted, high frequency screens such as [[Sepro Mineral Systems#Sepro-Sizetec Screens|Sepro-Sizetec Screens]] are used as a classifier which selects materials size that is small enough to enter the next stage for recovery. For example, the closed grinding circuit (e.g. recirculating network with ball mill). Firstly, it screens out the coarse particles and recirculates them back to the grinding mill machine. Then, the fine grain material will be unloaded timely, avoiding over crushing caused by re-grinding.&lt;ref&gt;Shanghai Oriental Heavy Industry Machinery Co,.Ltd,(2013),For Grinding Circuit High Frequency Screen Gives Great Help, http://pioneercrusher.com/new/For-Grinding-Circuit-High-Frequency-Scre.html, Last accessed: 28 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of using high frequency screens in mineral processing can meet the requirement of fineness easily for recovery and is able to achieve a smaller size separation, reducing capacity needed for comminution stage and overall energy consumption. Hence, improving the grade of the final product and providing a better recovery and screening efficiency.

==Advantages and limitations==
[[File:Popcorn Effect.gif|thumbnail|right|450px|The 'popcorn effect' during screening of minerals in high frequency vibrating screens]]
The high frequency vibrating screens achieves a high efficiency of separation and differs from its counterparts since it breaks down the [[surface tension]] between particles. Also the high level of RPMs contributes to increasing the stratification of material so they separate at a much higher rate. Separation cannot take place without stratification. Furthermore, since the screen vibrates vertically, there is a ‘popcorn effect’ whereby the coarser particles are lifted higher and finer particles stay closer to the screen, thus increases the probability of separation. In some high frequency vibrating screens the flow rate of the feed can be controlled, this is proportional to the ‘popcorn effect’; if the flow rate lowers, the effect is also decreased. Limitations of the high frequency vibrating screen are that the fine screens are very fragile and are susceptible to becoming blocked very easily. Over time the separation efficiency will drop and the screen will need to be replaced.&lt;ref name=kelly/&gt;

An alternative to the high frequency vibrating screens is the rotary sifter.  A rotary sifter uses a screen which rotates in a circular motion and the finer particles are sifted through the apertures. It is also generally used for finger separations; between 12mm to 45μm particle size. The rotary sifter will usually be chosen based on the nature of the substance being separated; whey, yeast bread mix, cheese powder, fertilizers. The rotary sifter is often preferred in the non-[[metallurgical]] industry and operates in a way to achieve a dust and noise free environment.  The limitation for the rotary sifter is that it cannot handle a high capacity compared to the high frequency vibrating screen. Both equipment, however, achieve a high screening efficiency.&lt;ref name=wills/&gt;

==Available designs==
Conventional and general design for a high frequency vibrating screen consists of mainframe, screen web, eccentric bock, electric motor, rub spring and coupler.&lt;ref&gt;SBM Mining and Construction Machinery, Portable Vibrating Screen Spec, 2011, http://www.pakistancrushers.com/stone_crushing_machine/vibrating-screen.html, Last accessed: 12 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The two most common types of vibrators which induce the high frequency vibrations are hydraulic or electric vibrators,&lt;ref&gt;High Frequency Screen, KPI-JCI and Astec Mobile Screens, Sales Sheet (2013), Astec Industries Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; these electric vibrators are either electric motors or solenoids.&lt;ref name=wills&gt;Wills, Barry A., (2006), Wills' Mineral Processing Technology: An Introduction to the Practical Aspects of Ore Treatment and Mineral Recovery, 7th Edition, Elsevier, pp. 195-196.&lt;/ref&gt; Common designs for screening decks are either single or double deck. In addition, another feature of high frequency vibrating screens are the static side plates which provide benefits such as smaller support structure, less noise, longer life, and hence less maintenance. In industry, the screens are operated at a tiled angle up till 40 º. The high frequency (1500 – 7200 rpm) and low amplitude (1.2 – 2.0&amp;nbsp;mm) characteristics leads to the vertical-elliptical movement that rapidly transports oversized particles down the screen.&lt;ref name=dry&gt;Dry Fine Screening – Principle of Operation, Aggregate Composite Catalog, DC Agg CC (2009), Derrick Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; Creating a thin bed of particles, this improves the efficiency and capacity of the screen.

Stationary screens are typically used in plants and not moved around. In the mineral processing industry, equipment often has to be moved to different sites depending on the jobs taken up by a company. Mobile screens thus are another viable design for companies who have to move their equipment often. These include wheel-mounted and track-mounted plants which allow for easy transportation and movement of the screens. Typical mobile screen designs are shown in the diagrams on left.

==Main process characteristics==
The screening performance is affected significantly by various factors such as equipment capacity and angle of inclination, in which the performance can be measured by screening efficiency and flux of the product.&lt;ref name=kelly/&gt;

Flux is defined as the amount of a desired component (undersize material) that has carried over the screening media from the feed per time per unit area.&lt;ref name=dean&gt;Dean Webber, (unknown), What is Screen Efficiency, http://www.ibulk.com.au/what-is-screening-efficiency/, Last accessed: 1 October 23&lt;/ref&gt; Screening efficiency is expressed as the ratio of the amount of material that actually passes through the aperture, divided by the amount in the feed that theoretically should pass. Commercially perfect screening is considered to be 95% efficient  &lt;ref name=wills/&gt; if the process is operated with appropriate feed concentration and size particles. Generally, a suitable particle size difference between sieving and feed should be no more than 30%.&lt;ref name=kelly/&gt; High screening efficiency can reduce the qualified gain content in cyclic loading and screening and thus increasing the processing capacity of the mill.

The equipment capacity is almost directly proportional to screen width. This means that by increasing the length, there will be additional chances for passage, and will usually lead to increase in transmission and efficiency. In general, the standard size of screen length should be two to three times the width.&lt;ref name=kelly/&gt; However, certain special situations such as restricted space may require a different design.

Angle of inclination can be designed based on the desired mineral grain. For example, wet sieving angle is generally around 25 ± 2 ° for concentrator. Increasing the slope of a screen will effectively reduce the aperture by the cosine of the angle of inclination.&lt;ref name=kelly/&gt; At the same time, the materials also move across the screen faster which leads to more rapid stratification.&lt;ref name=kelly/&gt;&lt;ref name=wills/&gt; However, the performance tends to decrease after a certain point since the slope of the deck is too high and most particles will remain on the oversized stream instead of passing through the aperture, thus, lower flux is yielded.

Table below presents relationship between inclined angle with desired product flux and efficiency.

==Characteristics assessment==

===Screen movement===
[[File:Dependence of Screening Efficiency on the amplitude and frequency of Vibration.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Dependence of screening efficiency on the amplitude and frequency of vibration]]
The purpose of the vibrating screen is that particles are introduced to the gaps in the screens repeatedly. The frequency of the screen must be high enough so that it prevents the particles from blocking the apertures and the maximum height of the particle trajectory should occur when the screen surface is at its lowest point. Based on the principle, there is an optimum frequency and amplitude of vibration &lt;ref name=kelly&gt;Enrol G. Kelly, Introduction to Mineral Processing, Wiley New York, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Transmission refers to the fraction of desired particle that passes through the apertures in the screen. At low frequency, screening efficiency is high but blinding is severe. Blinding will decrease as frequency increases but the particles will have difficulty going through the apertures. When designing a high frequency vibrating screen, an optimum point of frequency and amplitude must be chosen,&lt;ref name=kelly/&gt; depending on the specific applications.

===Separation efficiency===
The separation efficiency is simply a measure of the amount of material removed by the screen compared to the theoretical amount that should have been removed. Screen efficiency can be obtained using different equation, which depends on whether the desired product is the oversize or undersize fraction from the screen.

The screen efficiency based on the oversize (E&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) is given by: 
	
:::&lt;math&gt;E_o = \frac{Q_{ms}(o)\;[1-M_u(o)]}{Q_{ms}(f)\;[1-M_u(f)]}&lt;/math&gt;

The screen efficiency based on the undersize (E&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;) is then given by:

:::&lt;math&gt;E_u = \frac{Q_{ms}(u)\;M_u(u)}{Q_{ms}(f)\;M_u(f)}&lt;/math&gt;

where Q&lt;sub&gt;ms&lt;/sub&gt;(o) is the mass flow rate of solid in the screen overflow, Q&lt;sub&gt;ms&lt;/sub&gt;(f) is the mass flow rate of solid feed, Q&lt;sub&gt;ms&lt;/sub&gt;(u) is the mass flow rate of solid in the screen underflow, M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;(o) is the mass fraction of undersize in the overflow, &lt;br&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;(f) is the mass fraction of undersize in the feed, M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;(u) is the mass fraction of undersize in the underflow.&lt;ref name=wills/&gt;

The overall efficiency (E) is given by:

:::&lt;math&gt;E = E_o\;E_u&lt;/math&gt;

==Possible heuristics to be used during design of the process==
In the process of sizing minerals there are often rules of thumbs that need to be followed in order to achieve maximum efficiency in the separation.

=== Screen selection===
The selection on the screen type will be based on the materials that the equipment will be used to process. A significant problem occurs with screens because if the screen is not suitable for the material fed to the screen, the materials will blind the apertures and regular maintenance will be required. Different types of screens have been developed to counter this problem. An example is the "self-cleaning" wire; these wires are free to vibrate and so resistance to blinding will increase. The particles will be shaken off the wires and apertures. However, there will be a trade-off with screening efficiency.&lt;ref name=wills/&gt;

===Pre-treatment of feed===
The high frequency vibrating screens will often be used as a secondary screener as its purpose is to separate the finer minerals. This not only ensures good separation efficiency, it will also help to maintain the life-time of the screen. Blinding can occur significantly if particle sizes are not within the screens’ designed criteria.&lt;ref name=kelly/&gt;

Another problem that is often encountered is that the particles clump together due to the moist. This will result in the undesired particle size that is not allowed to pass through the apertures into the product stream. It is recommended that screening at less than around 5mm aperture size is normally performed on perfectly dry materials.&lt;ref name=wills/&gt; A heated screen deck may be used to evaporate the moist in the feed. It will also break the surface tension between the screen wire and the particles. An alternative is to run the feed through a dryer before entering the high frequency vibrating screen.

== Post-treatment systems ==
High frequency vibrating screens are widely used in many industrial process, thus there will be high quantity of waste product released into the environment. It is important that these waste streams are treated, since the untreated waste will cause damage to the environment over a sustained period of time.

An established post-treatment system is classification processing. In this system, the waste streams are separated into different types of waste materials. The types of waste materials are classified into recyclable materials, hazardous materials, organic materials, inorganic materials. Generally, waste materials are separated using mechanical separation and manual separation.&lt;ref name=asian&gt;Asian Institute of Technology 2004: Municipal Solid Waste Management in Asia. Asian Regional Research Program on Environmental Technology (ARRPET)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=solid&gt;Solid Waste Management: Principles and Practice, (2012), Remesha Chandrappa, Diganta Bhusan Das&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanical separations are used for separating metals and other materials that may be harmful to the environment, and also to prepare the waste stream for manual separations. Manual separation have two types of sorting which are positive sorting and negative sorting.&lt;ref name=asian/&gt;&lt;ref name=solid/&gt; Positive sorting collects reusable waste such as recyclable and organic materials while negative sorting collects unusable waste such as hazardous and inorganic materials. After this separation process, the recyclable materials are transferred for reuse. The organic wastes are often treated using chemical processes (e.g. combustion, pyrolysis etc.) or biological treatment (microbial decomposition).&lt;ref name=asian/&gt;&lt;ref name=solid/&gt; The products obtained from these waste organic materials are in the form of [[Refuse-Derived Fuel]]. RDF can be used in many ways to generate electricity or even used alongside with traditional sources of fuel in coal power plants. The rest of the hazardous and unwanted inorganic wastes are transferred to landfill to be disposed. These post-treatment processes are crucial to sustain the environment.

==New development==

===Screen improvements===
The research on high frequency screens has led to new developments in the field which enhance the operation and performance of the equipment. These new developments include the stacking of up to 5 individual screen decks placed on top of the other and operating in parallel. A divider system splits the feed slurry to each Stack Sizer® screen, then to each screen deck on the machine. Each screen deck has an undersize and oversize collection pan which will respectively go into their common outlet. The stacking of the machines thus allows more production while using less space.&lt;ref name=derrick&gt;Derrick Corporation, (2013), Polyweb® Urethane Screens, http://www.derrickcorp.com/webmodules/catCatalog/dtl_Product.aspx?ID=33, Last accessed: 14 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Another new development is the fabrication of Polyweb urethane screen surfaces that have openings as fine as 45&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] and open areas from 35% - 45%. This leads to the screen being able to separate finer particles. The screens can be used for both wet and dry applications and urethane formulation is still an ongoing process. Thus, research and development is still being invested in high frequency screening equipment to improve the overall separation efficiency and also to lower costs.&lt;ref name=corp&gt;Derrick Corporation, Stack Sizer, (2013), http://www.derrickcorp.com/webmodules/catCatalogdtl_Product.aspx?ID=42, Last accessed: 14 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanical part modifications===
To further optimize the performance for high frequency vibrating equipment, a "variable speed" hydraulic vibrator is being developed and used to drive the screen decks. It utilizes fluid hydraulic force which then can be converted into rotary power in order to generate high frequency vibration.&lt;ref =kpi&gt;KPI-JCI and Astec Industries Inc., (2013), High Frequency Screen, Mobile Screens Sales Sheet&lt;/ref&gt; This modification allows equipment to operate at higher frequency range, up to 8200 RPM, compared to the conventional electric vibrators. Besides that, the induced vibration also creates an excellent condition for separating finer particles and improves the contacting probability for the materials. Another variation that could be applied to the equipment is the "rotary tensioning system", in which it helps to provide a quicker screen media change.&lt;ref name=mobilescreens/&gt; Therefore, multiple applications can be achieved by single equipment, as with different size of feed material can be deal by replacing screens in a very small downtime. Hence, it improves the economic benefits of plants.

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}

'''High Blast Explosive''', or '''HBX''', is an explosive used as a bursting charge in missile warheads, mines, depth bombs, depth charges, and torpedoes.

==History==
It was developed during World War II as a desensitized modification of [[Torpex]] explosives.&lt;ref name="Ordnance Technical Data Sheet U.S. BOMB, 325-350-LB, DEPTH BOMB, MK 54/MK 54 Mod 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://64.78.11.86/uxofiles/mulvaney/techdatasheets/MK54depthbomb.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615014543/http://64.78.11.86/uxofiles/mulvaney/techdatasheets/MK54depthbomb.pdf |archivedate=2015-06-15 |df= }} "Ordnance Technical Data Sheet U.S. BOMB, 325-350-LB, DEPTH BOMB, MK 54/MK 54 Mod 1"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
It is an aluminized (powdered aluminum) explosive having the same order of sensitivity as [[Composition B]].&lt;ref name="Ordnance Technical Data Sheet U.S. BOMB, 325-350-LB, DEPTH BOMB, MK 54/MK 54 Mod 1"/&gt;

Tests indicate that it is about 98% to 100% as powerful as Torpex, that it is definitely less sensitive than Torpex in both laboratory impact and bullet impact, that it is slightly more sensitive in these respects than [[TNT]], and that is be about the same order as Composition B.&lt;ref name="U.S. Explosive Ordnance, OP 1664, 1947"&gt;[http://maritime.org/doc/ordnance/index.htm] "U.S. Explosive Ordnance, OP 1664, 1947"&lt;/ref&gt;

A difficulty with HBX is that it produces gas and builds up pressure in the case during stowage. It was discovered that adding calcium chloride to the mixture will absorb all the moisture and eliminate the production of gas.&lt;ref name="U.S. Explosive Ordnance, OP 1664, 1947"/&gt;

==Composition==
There are three types of HBX explosives: '''HBX-1''', '''HBX-3''', and '''H-6'''. Below is each type's "Grade A" composition based on weight:&lt;ref name="MIL-E-22267 Rev. A"&gt;[http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-SPECS/MIL-SPECS-MIL-E/MIL-E-22267A_5974/] "MIL-E-22267 Rev. A"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In Mortal Hands: A Cautionary History of the Nuclear Age''''' is a 2009 book by [[Stephanie Cooke]].  The book explains why [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] failed to develop in the way its planners hoped, and explores the relationship between the military and civilian sides of nuclear energy.  In the book, Cooke argues that we are not close to solving the [[nuclear waste]] problem, and that "the billions spent by government on nuclear over the past sixty years crowded out other energy options".&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Cooke (2009). ''In Mortal Hands: A Cautionary History of the Nuclear Age'', Black Inc., p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The book suggests that there are practical reasons why [[nuclear reactor]]s are unlikely to provide a solution to the global [[climate change]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stephaniescooke.com/Economist%20Cautionary%20tales.pdf  Cautionary tales], ''The Economist,'' April 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://stephaniescooke.com/A_Nuclear_Waste.pdf A Nuclear Waste], ''The New York Times'', March 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Instrumentation''' is a collective term for [[measuring instrument]]s used for indicating, measuring and recording physical quantities, and has its origins in the art and science of [[Scientific instrument|scientific instrument-making]]. 

The term '''instrumentation''' may refer to a device or group of devices used for direct reading [[thermometers]] or, when using many sensors, may become part of a complex [[industrial control system]] in such as manufacturing industry, vehicles and transportation. Instrumentation can be found in the household as well; a [[smoke detector]] or a heating [[thermostat]] are examples.

== History and development==
[[Image:Steuerstand01.jpg|thumb|A local instrumentation panel on a steam turbine.]]
The history of instrumentation can be divide into several phases. 
===Pre-industrial===
Elements of industrial instrumentation have long histories. Scales for comparing weights and simple pointers to indicate position are ancient technologies. Some of the earliest measurements were of time. One of the oldest [[water clock]]s was found in the tomb of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian pharaoh [[Amenhotep I]], buried around 1500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Early Clocks | url = https://www.nist.gov/pml/general/time/early.cfm | accessdate = 1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements were incorporated in the clocks. By 270 BCE they had the rudiments of an automatic control system device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Building automation history page | url = http://www.building-automation-consultants.com/building-automation-history.html | accessdate = 1 March 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708104028/http://www.building-automation-consultants.com/building-automation-history.html | archivedate = 8 July 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1663 [[Christopher Wren]] presented the Royal Society with a design for a "weather clock". A drawing shows meteorological sensors moving pens over paper driven by clockwork. Such devices did not become standard in meteorology for two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;

Available from Project Gutenberg.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has remained virtually unchanged as evidenced by pneumatic chart recorders, where a pressurized bellows displaces a pen. Integrating sensors, displays, recorders and controls was uncommon until the industrial revolution, limited by both need and practicality.

===Early industrial===
[[File:Analogue control loop evolution.png|thumb|The evolution of analogue control loop signalling from the pneumatic era to the electronic era.]]
Early systems used direct process connections to local control panels for control and indication, which from the early 1930s saw the introduction of pneumatic transmitters and automatic 3-term (PID) controllers.

The ranges of pneumatic transmitters were defined by the need to control valves and actuators in the field. Typically a signal ranged from 3 to 15 psi (20 to 100kPa or 0.2 to 1.0 kg/cm2) as a standard, was standardized with 6 to 30 psi occasionally being used for larger valves. 
Transistor electronics enabled wiring to replace pipes, initially with a range of 20 to 100mA at up to 90V for loop powered devices, reducing to 4 to 20mA at 12 to 24V in more modern systems. A [[transmitter]] is a device that produces an output signal, often in the form of a 4&amp;ndash;20&amp;nbsp;[[Ampere|mA]] electrical [[current (electrical)|current]] signal, although many other options using [[voltage]], [[frequency]], [[pressure]], or [[ethernet]] are possible. The [[Transistor#History|transistor]] was commercialized by the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=704244&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D704244] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518092416/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=704244&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D704244|date=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instruments attached to a control system provided signals used to operate [[solenoid]]s, [[valve]]s, [[Regulator (automatic control)|regulators]], [[circuit breaker]]s, [[relay]]s and other devices. Such devices could control a desired output variable, and provide either remote or automated control capabilities.

Each instrument company introduced their own standard instrumentation signal, causing confusion until the 4-20&amp;nbsp;mA range was used as the standard electronic instrument signal for transmitters and valves. This signal was eventually standardized as ANSI/ISA S50, “Compatibility of Analog Signals for Electronic Industrial Process Instruments", in the 1970s. The transformation of instrumentation from mechanical pneumatic transmitters, controllers, and valves to electronic instruments reduced maintenance costs as electronic instruments were more dependable than mechanical instruments. This also increased efficiency and production due to their increase in accuracy. Pneumatics enjoyed some advantages, being favored in corrosive and explosive atmospheres.&lt;ref name=Anderson2&gt;

===Automatic process control===
[[File:Industrial control loop.jpg|thumb|Example of a single industrial control loop; showing continuously modulated control of process flow.]]
In the early years of [[process control]], process indicators and control elements such as valves were monitored by an operator that walked around the unit adjusting the valves to obtain the desired temperatures, pressures, and flows. As technology evolved pneumatic controllers were invented and mounted in the field that monitored the process and controlled the valves. This reduced the amount of time process operators were needed to monitor the process. Later years the actual controllers were moved to a central room and signals were sent into the control room to monitor the process and outputs signals were sent to the final control element such as a valve to adjust the process as needed. These controllers and indicators were mounted on a wall called a control board. The operators stood in front of this board walking back and forth monitoring the process indicators. This again reduced the number and amount of time process operators were needed to walk around the units. The most standard pneumatic signal level used during these years was 3-15 psig.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;

===Large integrated computer-based systems===
[[Image:Pneumatische regelaar.jpg|thumb|Pneumatic "Three term" pneumatic [[PID controller]], widely used before electronics became reliable and cheaper and safe to use in hazardous areas (Siemens Telepneu Example)]]
[[File:Kontrollrom Tyssedal.jpg|thumb|A pre-DCS/SCADA era central control room. Whilst the controls are centralised in one place, they are still discrete and not integrated into one system.]] 
[[File:Leitstand 2.jpg|thumb|A DCS control room where plant information and controls are displayed on computer graphics screens. The operators are seated and can view and control any part of the process from their screens, whilst retaining a plant overview.]]
Process control of large industrial plants has evolved through many stages. Initially, control would be from panels local to the process plant. However this required a large manpower resource to attend to these dispersed panels, and there was no overall view of the process. The next logical development was the transmission of all plant measurements to a permanently-manned central control room. Effectively this was the centralisation of all the localised panels, with the advantages of lower manning levels and easier overview of the process. Often the controllers were behind the control room panels, and all automatic and manual control outputs were transmitted back to plant. 

However, whilst providing a central control focus, this arrangement was inflexible as each control loop had its own controller hardware, and continual operator movement within the control room was required to view different parts of the process. With coming of electronic processors and graphic displays it became possible to replace these discrete controllers with computer-based algorithms, hosted on a network of input/output racks with their own control processors. These could be distributed around plant, and communicate with the graphic display in the control room or rooms. The distributed control concept was born. 

The introduction of DCSs and [[SCADA]] allowed easy interconnection and re-configuration of plant controls such as cascaded loops and interlocks, and easy interfacing with other production computer systems. It enabled sophisticated alarm handling, introduced automatic event logging, removed the need for physical records such as chart recorders, allowed the control racks to be networked and thereby located locally to plant to reduce cabling runs, and provided high level overviews of plant status and production levels.

== Applications ==
In some cases the sensor is a very minor element of the mechanism. Digital cameras and wristwatches might technically meet the loose definition of instrumentation because they record and/or display sensed information. Under most circumstances neither would be called instrumentation, but when used to measure the elapsed time of a race and to document the winner at the finish line, both would be called instrumentation.

===Household===
A very simple example of an instrumentation system is a mechanical [[thermostat]], used to control a household furnace and thus to control room temperature. A typical unit senses temperature with a [[bi-metallic strip]]. It displays temperature by a needle on the free end of the strip. It activates the furnace by a [[mercury switch]]. As the switch is rotated by the strip, the mercury makes physical (and thus electrical) contact between electrodes.

Another example of an instrumentation system is a [[Burglar alarm|home security system]]. Such a system consists of 
sensors (motion detection, switches to detect door openings), simple algorithms to detect intrusion, local control (arm/disarm) and remote monitoring of the system so that the police can be summoned. Communication is an inherent part of the design.

Kitchen appliances use sensors for control.
*A refrigerator maintains a constant temperature by measuring the internal temperature.
*A microwave oven sometimes cooks via a heat-sense-heat-sense cycle until sensing done.
*An automatic ice machine makes ice until a [[Miniature snap-action switch|limit switch]] is thrown.
*Pop-up bread [[toaster]]s can operate by time or by heat measurements. 
*Some ovens use a temperature probe to cook until a target internal food temperature is reached.
*A common [[toilet]] refills the water tank until a float closes the valve. The float is acting as a water level sensor.

===Automotive===
Modern automobiles have complex instrumentation. In addition to displays of engine rotational speed and vehicle linear speed, there are also displays of battery voltage and current, fluid levels, fluid temperatures, distance traveled and feedbacks of various controls (turn signals, parking brake, headlights, transmission position). Cautions may be displayed for special problems (fuel low, check engine, tire pressure low, door ajar, seat belt unfastened). Problems are recorded so they can be reported to  [[Vehicle bus|diagnostic equipment]]. Navigation systems can provide voice commands to reach a destination. Automotive instrumentation must be cheap and reliable over long periods in harsh environments. There may be independent [[airbag]] systems which contain sensors, logic and actuators. [[Anti-lock braking system|Anti-skid]] braking systems use sensors to control the brakes, while [[cruise control]] affects throttle position. A wide variety of services can be provided via communication links as the [[OnStar]] system. [[Autonomous car]]s (with exotic instrumentation) have been demonstrated.

===Aircraft===
Early aircraft had a few sensors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cap-ny153.org/aircraftinstrumentation.htm Aircraft Instrumentation - Leroy R. Grumman Cadet Squadron&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; "Steam gauges" converted air pressures into needle deflections that could be interpreted as altitude and airspeed. A magnetic compass provided a sense of direction. The displays to the pilot were as critical as the measurements.

A modern aircraft has a far more sophisticated suite of sensors and displays, which are embedded into [[avionics]] systems. The aircraft may contain [[inertial navigation system]]s, [[global positioning system]]s, [[weather radar]], autopilots, and aircraft stabilization systems. Redundant sensors are used for reliability. A subset of the information may be transferred to a [[Event data recorder|crash recorder]] to aid mishap investigations. Modern pilot displays now include computer displays including [[head-up display]]s.

[[Air traffic control radar beacon system|Air traffic control radar]] is distributed instrumentation system. The ground portion transmits an electromagnetic pulse and receives an echo (at least). Aircraft carry transponders that transmit codes on reception of the pulse. The system displays aircraft map location, an identifier and optionally altitude. The map location is based on sensed antenna direction and sensed time delay. The other information is embedded in the transponder transmission.

===Laboratory instrumentation===
Among the possible uses of the term is a collection of laboratory test equipment controlled by a computer through an IEEE-488 bus (also known as GPIB for General Purpose Instrument Bus or HPIB for Hewlitt Packard Instrument Bus). Laboratory equipment is available to measure many electrical and chemical quantities. Such a collection of equipment might be used to automate the testing of drinking water for pollutants.

== Measurement parameters==
Instrumentation is used to measure many parameters (physical values). These parameters include:

== Instrumentation engineering ==
[[Image:Pump with tank pid en.svg|thumb|The instrumentation part of a [[Piping and instrumentation diagram]] will be developed by an instrumentation engineer.]] 
'''Instrumentation engineering''' is the engineering specialization focused on the principle and operation of measuring instruments that are used in design and configuration of automated systems in electrical, pneumatic domains etc and the control of quantities being measured.
They typically work for industries with [[automated]] processes, such as [[Chemical plant|chemical]] or [[manufacturing]] plants, with the goal of improving system [[productivity]], reliability, safety, optimization and stability.
To control the parameters in a process or in a particular system, devices such as microprocessors, microcontrollers or PLCs are used, but their ultimate aim is to control the parameters of a system.

Instrumentation engineering is loosely defined because the required tasks are very domain dependent. An expert in the biomedical instrumentation of laboratory rats has very different concerns than the expert in rocket instrumentation. Common concerns of both are the selection of appropriate sensors based on size, weight, cost, reliability, accuracy, longevity, environmental robustness and frequency response. Some sensors are literally fired in artillery shells. Others sense thermonuclear explosions until destroyed. Invariably sensor data must be recorded, transmitted or displayed. Recording rates and capacities vary enormously. Transmission can be trivial or can be clandestine, encrypted and low-power in the presence of jamming. Displays can be trivially simple or can require consultation with [[human factors]] experts. Control system design varies from trivial to a separate specialty.

Instrumentation engineers are responsible for integrating the sensors with the recorders, transmitters, displays or control systems, and producing the [[Piping and instrumentation diagram]] for the process. They may design or specify installation, wiring and signal conditioning. They may be responsible for calibration, testing and maintenance of the system.

In a research environment it is common for subject matter experts to have substantial instrumentation system expertise. An astronomer knows the structure of the universe and a great deal about telescopes - optics, pointing and cameras (or other sensing elements). That often includes the hard-won knowledge of the operational procedures that provide the best results. For example, an astronomer is often knowledgeable of techniques to minimize temperature gradients that cause air turbulence within the telescope.

Instrumentation technologists, technicians and mechanics specialize in troubleshooting, repairing and maintaining instruments and instrumentation systems.

=== Typical Industrial Transmitter Signal Types ===
[[Current loop|Current Loop (4-20mA)]] - Electrical

[[Hart Protocol|HART]] - Data signalling often overlaid on a current loop.

[[FOUNDATION Fieldbus|Foundation Fieldbus]] - Data signalling

[[Profibus]] - Data signalling

==Impact of modern development==
Ralph Müller (1940) stated "That the history of physical science is largely the history of instruments and their intelligent use is well known. The broad generalizations and theories which have arisen from time to time have stood or fallen on the basis of accurate measurement, and in several instances new instruments have had to be devised for the purpose. There is little evidence to show that the mind of modern man is superior to that of the ancients. His tools are incomparably better."&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Eric|last2=Light|first2=Andrew|last3=Thompson|first3=William|title=Controlling technology : contemporary issues|date=2002|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, NY|isbn=978-1573929837|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nny8OoQCZCoC&amp;pg=PA88|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baird"/&gt;{{rp|290}}

Davis Baird has argued that the major change associated with [[Floris Cohen]]{{'}}s identification of a "fourth big scientific revolution" after [[World War II]] is the development of scientific instrumentation, not only in [[chemistry]] but across the sciences.&lt;ref name="Baird"&gt;{{cite journal

As early as 1954, W A Wildhack discussed both the productive and destructive potential inherent in process control.&lt;ref name="Wildhack"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wildhack|first1=W. A.|title=Instrumentation--Revolution in Industry, Science, and Warfare|journal=Science|date=22 October 1954|volume=120|issue=3121|pages=15A–15A|doi=10.1126/science.120.3121.15A|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/120/3121/15A.long|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ability to make precise, verifiable and reproducible measurements of the natural world, at levels that were not previously observable, using scientific instrumentation, has "provided a different texture of the world".&lt;ref name="Hentschel"/&gt; This instrumentation revolution fundamentally changes human abilities to monitor and respond, as is illustrated in the examples of [[DDT]] monitoring and the use of [[Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy|UV spectrophotometry]] and [[gas chromatography]] to monitor [[water pollutants]].&lt;ref name="Morris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hentschel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hentschel|first1=Klaus|title=The Instrumental Revolution in Chemistry (Review Essay)|journal=Foundations of Chemistry|date=2003|volume=5|issue=2|pages=179–183|doi=10.1023/A:1023691917565|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1023691917565#/page-1|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''jackup rig''' or a self-elevating unit is a type of mobile platform that consists of a buoyant [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] fitted with a number of movable legs, capable of raising its hull over the surface of the sea. The buoyant hull enables transportation of the unit and all attached machinery to a desired location. Once on location the hull is raised to the required elevation above the sea surface supported by the sea bed. The legs of such units may be designed to penetrate the sea bed, may be fitted with enlarged sections or footings, or may be attached to a bottom mat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=RULES FOR BUILDING AND CLASSING MOBILE OFFSHORE DRILLING UNITS|year=2008|publisher=American Bureau of Shipping|pages=3.1.1 Page 5|url=http://www.eagle.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally jackup rigs are not [[Marine propulsion|self-propelled]] and rely on [[Tugboat|tugs]] or [[heavy lift ship]]s for transportation.

Jackup platforms are used as exploratory drilling platforms and offshore and wind farm service platforms. Jackup platforms have been the most popular and numerous of various mobile types in existence. The total number of jackup drilling rigs in operation numbered about 540 at the end of 2013.

==Name==
Jackup rigs are so named because they are self-elevating with three, four, six and even eight movable legs that can be extended (“jacked”) above or below the hull. Jackups are towed or moved under self propulsion to the site with the hull lowered to the water level, and the legs extended above the hull. The hull is actually a water-tight barge that floats on the water’s surface. When the rig reaches the work site, the crew jacks the legs downward through the water and into the sea floor (or onto the sea floor with mat supported jackups). This anchors the rig and holds the hull well above the waves.

==History==
[[File:DeLong Barge at Con. Western Dock, Orange, Texas (8380385127).jpg|thumb|A [[DeLong platform]] at [[Consolidated Steel Corporation|Consolidated Western]], [[Orange, Texas]] in 1955]]
An early design was the [[DeLong platform]] that [[Leon B. DeLong]] designed. In 1949 he started his own company, DeLong Engineering &amp; Construction Company. In 1950 he constructed the ''DeLong Rig No. 1'' for [[Magnolia Petroleum Company|Magnolia Petroleum]], consisting of a barge with six legs. In 1953 DeLong entered into a [[joint-venture]] with [[McDermott International|McDermott]], which built the ''DeLong-McDermott No.1'' in 1954 for [[Humble Oil]].This was the first mobile offshore drilling platform. This barge had ten legs which had ''spud cans'' to prevent them from digging into the seabed too deep. When DeLong-McDermott was taken over by the [[Southern Natural Gas Company]] which formed [[The Offshore Company]] the platform was called ''Offshore No. 51''.

In 1954, [[HRG Group|Zapata Offshore]], owned by [[George H. W. Bush]] ordered the ''Scorpion''. It was designed by [[R. G. LeTourneau]] and featured three electro-mechanically-operated lattice type legs. Built on the shores of the [[Mississippi river]] by the [[LeTourneau Technologies|LeTourneau Company]], it was launched in December 1955. The ''Scorpion'' was put into operation in May 1956 off [[Port Aransas]], Texas. The second, also designed by LeTourneau, was called ''Vinegaroon''. &lt;ref&gt;http://iadc.org/dcpi/dc-septoct05/Sept05-anniversary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ibvuWmF7Dc&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==

A jackup rig is a barge fitted with long support legs that can be raised or lowered. The jackup is maneuvered (self-propelled or by towing) into location with its legs up and the hull floating on the water. Upon arrival at the work location, the legs are jacked down onto the seafloor. Then "preloading" takes place, where the weight of the barge and additional ballast water are used to drive the legs securely into the sea bottom so they will not penetrate further while operations are carried out. After preloading, the jacking system is used to raise the entire barge above the water to a predetermined height or "air gap", so that wave, tidal and current loading acts only on the relatively slender legs and not on the barge hull.

Modern jacking systems use a [[rack and pinion]] gear arrangement&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gustomsc.com/equipment/vsd-rack-pinion-jacking-system Rack and Pinion jacking system example]&lt;/ref&gt; where the pinion gears are driven by hydraulic or electric motors and the rack is affixed to the legs.

Jackup rigs can only be placed in relatively shallow waters, generally less than {{convert|120|m|ft}} of water. However, a specialized class of jackup rigs known as premium or ultra-premium jackups are known to have operational capability in water depths ranging from 150 to 190 meters (500 to 625 feet).&lt;ref&gt;[http://shipbuildinghistory.com/world/highvalueships/jackups.htm World Jackup Drilling Rig Fleet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Mobile offshore Drilling Units (MODU)===
This type of rig is commonly used in connection with [[Oil platform|oil and/or natural gas drilling]]. There are more jackup rigs in the worldwide offshore rig fleet than other type of mobile offshore [[drilling rig]]. Other types of offshore rigs include [[semi-submersibles]] (which float on pontoon-like structures) and [[drillship]]s, which are ship-shaped vessels with rigs mounted in their center. These rigs drill through holes in the drillship hulls, known as moon pools.

===Turbine Installation Vessel (TIV)===



{{further|TIV MPI Resolution}}
This type of rig is commonly used in connection with [[List of offshore wind farms|offshore wind turbine]] installation.

===Barges===
''Jackup rigs'' can also refer to specialized [[barge]]s that are similar to an oil and gas platform but are used as a base for servicing other structures such as [[List of offshore wind farms|offshore wind turbines]], long bridges, and drilling platforms.

'''Machinima, Inc.''' is a multiplatform online entertainment network operated by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Digital Networks]]. Machinima's programming has had widespread availability across multiple platforms such as [[YouTube]], [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitch.tv]], and [[Amazon Prime Video]].&lt;ref name="MachinimaCompanyInformation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Machinima, Inc.: Private Company Information - Businessweek|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=50132088|publisher=Businessweek.com|accessdate=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was founded in January 2000&lt;ref name=MachinimaCompanyInformation/&gt; by Hugh Hancock and was headquartered in [[Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Machinima Breaks One Billion Monthly Video Views |url=http://www.machinima.com/blog/posts/machinima-breaks-one-billion-monthly-video-views |date=December 5, 2011 |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Machinima.com |accessdate=February 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202622/http://www.machinima.com/blog/posts/machinima-breaks-one-billion-monthly-video-views |archive-date=October 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It originated as a hub for its namesake, [[machinima]], which uses and manipulates video-game technology to create [[animation]],&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite news|last=DVorkin|first=Lewis|title=Who's Doing It Right?

The website initially helped to bring attention to machinima as an art form and to encourage productions based on game engines other than those of [[id Software]]'s [[first-person shooter]] computer game series ''[[Quake series|Quake]]''.&lt;ref name="Marino 12-13"&gt;Marino, 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the website's focus shifted to general entertainment programming centered around [[video game culture]], [[comic books]] and fandom.

On October 12, 2016, sources told media sites that [[Warner Bros.]] was nearing a deal to acquire Machinima and its branded properties.&lt;ref name="Variety 10/2016"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/warner-bros-machinima-acquisition-talks-1201887244/ |title=Warner Bros.

==History==
[[File:Inside Gaming Awards 2011.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Inside Gaming Awards 2011|''2011 Inside Gaming Awards'' presented by Machinima]]
In December 1999, id Software released ''[[Quake III Arena]]''. According to [[Paul Marino]], executive director of the [[Academy of Machinima Arts &amp; Sciences]], film makers who had been using prior versions of the ''Quake'' series to record animated videos, then called "''Quake'' movies", were initially excited, but the enthusiasm dampened when id announced that, in an attempt to curtail [[cheating in online games|cheating]] in [[multiplayer game]]s, it would take legal action against anyone who released details of ''Quake III''{{'}}s networking code, which was included in the game's [[game demo]] file format. This precluded the use of custom demo-editing tools that had facilitated the creation of videos that used the older ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' and ''[[Quake II]]'' demo file formats, slowing the release of new ''Quake'' movies. Another contributing factor to this decline was that the self-referential nature of the gaming-related situations and commentary of ''Quake'' movies was losing novelty. Marino explained bluntly that "the joke was getting old".&lt;ref name="Marino 10-11"&gt;Marino, 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the ''Quake'' movie community needed to reinvent itself.&lt;ref name="Marino 11"&gt;Marino, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Machinima VS Logo.jpg|thumb|right|130px| Machinima VS logo]]

In January 2000, Hugh Hancock launched Machinima.com, a resource for video makers who used computer and video games as a medium. The site's name was foreign to the ''Quake'' movie community. The term ''machinima'' was originally ''machinema'', a [[portmanteau]] of ''machine'' and ''cinema''. However, Hancock had misspelled the term in a previous email, and the new name stuck because he and Anthony Bailey, who had worked on ''[[Quake done Quick]]'', liked the now-embedded reference to [[anime]].&lt;ref name="Marino 12"&gt;Marino 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site opened with multiple articles, interviews, and tutorials, and was soon able to acquire exclusive releases of new productions. One such work, ''[[Quad God]]'', was the first to use ''Quake III Arena'' and the first to be released in a conventional video file format instead of a demo file format exclusive to a certain game.&lt;ref name="Marino 12" /&gt; The switch to conventional media offended some machinima producers, but ''Quad God'', by [[Tritin Films]] helped to introduce machinima to a wider audience&lt;ref name="Kelland 30"&gt;Kelland, Morris, &amp; Lloyd, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; and to solidify Machinima.com's launch.&lt;ref name="Marino 12" /&gt; Matt Kelland, Dave Morris, and Dave Lloyd called the release of ''Quad God'' "a key moment in the development of machinima.&lt;ref name="Kelland 30" /&gt; In turn, as Machinima.com became more popular throughout 2000, other game engines, such as that of ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'', became the basis of new productions and the focus of new software tools for machinima.&lt;ref name="Marino 12" /&gt;

===2006–present===
On 30 January 2006, Hancock announced his resignation as editor-in-chief of Machinima.com and that control of the site would be transferred to the staff of Machinima, Inc. Among the reasons cited for the change were differences in approach to the site and a desire to devote more time to Strange Company's [[2006 in machinima|2006 machinima production]] ''[[BloodSpell]]''. Hancock called the decision "possibly the biggest step I've taken since I founded Strange Company nearly nine years ago".{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Towards the end of 2010, Machinima revamped its website and removed the forums (wanting users to use the Facebook page instead), and the ability to upload videos. Since the revamp of their website, Machinima has shifted focus away from actual machinima content. The network now focuses on gamer lifestyle and entertainment programming, broadcasting solely through their YouTube channels.

In January 2012, Machinima discontinued podcast feeds on iTunes without an in-feed announcement. Back episodes remain available but no new episodes have appeared on the feed since moving to YouTube exclusively. In June 2012, Machinima partnered with Meteor Entertainment to promote [[Hawken (video game)|Hawken]], a highly anticipated free-to-play online game which was later released in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/06/01/machinima-scores-partnership-to-promote-highly-anticipated-hawken-game-exclusive/ |title=Machinima Partners with Meteor Entertainment  |publisher=VentureBeat |accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same month, Microsoft announced the inclusion of Machinima programming on Xbox Live during the 2012 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/06/04/xbox-e3-espn-nickelodeon/ |title=Xbox Live is getting Nickelodeon, Machinima, &amp; tons of live sports  |publisher=VentureBeat |accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, Google invested $35 million into Machinima. It was the first time Google has openly backed a content company by taking an equity stake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allthingsd.com/20120507/google-gets-deeper-into-the-content-business-by-putting-money-into-machinima/ |title=Google Invests in Machinima |publisher=AllThingsD.com |accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, Machinima.com announced it was letting go of 23 staff from its workforce. Machinima said the lay-offs were due to re-organizing as part of its global growth strategy, but were still hiring in other key divisions whilst these layoffs were happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Machinima Layoffs|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/12/14/machinima-layoffs/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, the main channel briefly returned to uploading original machinima series and movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by-Jy2WgG6Q |title=Beats By Dre x Elizabeth Comstock - machinima back on Machinima |accessdate=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, [[Warner Bros.]] led an $18 million round of funding for Machinima.&lt;ref name=variety-warnerstake&gt;{{cite news|title=Warner Bros. Is Buying a Stake in Struggling YouTube Net Machinima.

Former [[Ovation (U.S. TV channel)|Ovation]] COO Chad Gutsein was installed in his place. In November 2014, Machinima announced plans to rebrand their network, with a revamped logo and new tagline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/11/10/machinima-unveils-rebranding-effort-and-expanded-partner-program/|title=Machinima Unveils Rebranding Effort and Expanded Partner Program|work=CMO Today|last=Shields|first=Mike|date=November 10, 2014|accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, the company raised an additional $42 million in funding led by Warner Bros. Machinima said that the additional funding would be used to accelerate growth through more investments in content and technology to better serve the firms audiences, advertisers, creators and distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://siliconangle.com/blog/2015/02/20/machinima-raises-42-million-series-e-in-round-led-by-warner-bros/ | title=Machinima raises $42 million Series E in round led by Warner Bros. | publisher=SiliconANGLE Media | date=20 February 2015 | accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 12, 2016, sources told media sites that [[Warner Bros.]] was nearing a deal to acquire Machinima and its branded properties.&lt;ref name="Variety 10/2016" /&gt; On November 17, 2016, Warner Bros. confirmed the news, thus making Machinima a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Bros. Digital Networks.&lt;ref name="Hollywood Reporter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety 11/2016" /&gt;

On February 14, 2018, after being integrated into Warner Bros. Digital Networks, Machinima unveiled a new logo and plans to shift its programming back towards gamer-centric content, and away from the [[Multi-channel network]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/warner-bros-unveils-machinima-rebrand-year-integration-1084733 | title=Warner Bros.

In November 2018, ''[[Deadline.com]]'' reported that Warner Bros.' new parent company [[AT&amp;T]] was preparing to reorganize Machinima into [[Otter Media]]—owner of the multi-channel network [[Fullscreen (company)|Fullscreen]], and [[Rooster Teeth Productions]]—which similarly produces gaming-oriented content and series. Otter was previously a joint venture between AT&amp;T and [[Chernin Group]]; AT&amp;T bought out Chernin's stake shortly after its purchase of Time Warner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2018/11/warnermedia-owned-machinima-to-become-part-of-atts-otter-media-1202506039/|title=WarnerMedia-Owned Machinima To Become Part Of AT&amp;T’s Otter Media|last=Hayes|first=Dawn C.

==Programming==
{{primary sources|date=October 2012}}

Machinima's content was primarily hosted on various [[YouTube]] channels. Content uploaded onto these channels are either produced in-house or by signed directors. Machinima has also utilized [[social media]] platforms to provide fans with featured uploads, interactive questions, and live event coverage.

===Inside Gaming===
''Inside Gaming'' was the main editorial brand of Machinima.&lt;ref name="MachinimaInsideGaming"&gt;{{cite web|title=Machinima Announces Winners of Third Annual Inside Gaming Awards  - Machinima|url=http://www.machinima.com/blog/posts/machinima-announces-winners-of-third-annual-inside-gaming-awards|publisher=Machinima.com|accessdate=16 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211022611/http://www.machinima.com/blog/posts/machinima-announces-winners-of-third-annual-inside-gaming-awards|archivedate=11 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage of gaming news, previews, and reviews was provided for more than 600,000 weekly viewers through daily and weekly shows on its YouTube channel&lt;ref name=MachinimaInsideGaming/&gt; hosted by then employee Adam Kovic under the alias "The Dead Pixel". He was often seen in [[Halo 3]]-themed machinima form in his lava-red Recon helmet.

''Inside Gaming'' is the successor to Machinima's discontinued segment, ''Inside Halo'', which was less successful because of the lack of news surrounding the Halo series. ''Inside Halo'' was developed and hosted by "Soda God" who alternated weekly hosting with Adam Kovic who became the only host. Eventually an official co-host, Matt Dannevik, joined Kovic on the set of ''Inside Gaming Daily''; he was laid off in December 2012. Producers Bruce Greene and James Willems regularly co-hosted with Kovic, and have started their own YouTube channel under ''Inside Gaming''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/show/insidegaming |title='&amp;#39;'YouTube'&amp;#39;': '&amp;#39;Inside Gaming'&amp;#39; |publisher=Youtube.com |accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Inside Gaming'' also hosted its own annual awards show, the "Inside Gaming Awards" in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=MachinimaInsideGaming/&gt; The awards show celebrates the biggest developers and achievements in the video-games industry,&lt;ref name=MachinimaInsideGaming/&gt; and features top gaming choices by viewers and the staff of ''Inside Gaming''. Categories in which games are selected include, among others: Game of the Year, Best Online Multiplayer, and Best Original Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidegamingdaily.com/2011/11/28/machinima-com-announces-nominees-for-inside-gaming-awards-2011/ |last=Sonntag |first=Lawrence |title=Machinima.com Announces Nominees for Inside Gaming Awards 2011 |publisher=Machinima |accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 26, 2015, Inside Gaming employees Adam Kovic, Bruce Greene, Lawrence Sonntag, Joel Rubin, Sean Poole, James Willems, and Matt Peake announced that they were leaving Machinima. The group is now known as [[Rooster Teeth Productions#Funhaus|Funhaus]], a subsidiary of [[Rooster Teeth|Rooster Teeth Productions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roosterteeth.com/members/journal/entry.php?id=3306197|title=Introducing Funhaus|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 9, 2015, Matt Dannevik announced in a video that he would be returning to Machinima and taking over the Inside Gaming channel, with help from other members of Machinima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfrDho3dExo|title=Inside Gaming Announcement (Look What the Cat Dragged In)|first=|last=Inside Gaming|date=9 April 2015|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel, and the show, has since become inactive.

===ETC News===
''ETC News'', otherwise known as simply ''ETC'', was Machinima's entertainment news show that started in 2010. The name originally stood for "Entertainment, Technology, Culture." It was originally hosted by Khail Anonymous, who later left the company in 2014 and currently works for ''[[Yahoo! News]]''. It was most recently hosted by Machinima employees Ricky Hayberg and Eliot Dewberry, before their departure from the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advertise on Machinima's The ETC Podcast|url=http://shows.midroll.com/ed992c-machinima-s-etc-ask-us-anything|website=Midroll|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally airing on the primary Machinima channel the show was moved to its own channel on June 30, 2016, though Ricky and Eliot still worked for Machinima and the show was still owned by them. 

''ETC Daily'' was the main show, with weekly shows such as ''TechNewsDay'' (originally Tech Tuesday, but renamed in order to remove the inherent deadline) for technology news, ''Weekly Weird News'' for exploring odd headlines and going deeper into "crazy" news stories, News Dump for covering film news, ''T.U.G.S.'' (''The Totally Uninformed Gaming Show'') for gaming news meant to satirize what the hosts considered to be game journalists who were far too soft on gaming companies, though the show was later moved to the specialized gaming channel, ETC Party Time. Outside of news, the channel hosted the ''ETC Podcast'', where the hosts interviewed creators such as Dan Harmon &amp; Justin Roiland, Mike Shinoda, Tony Hale, Ed Skrein, Elijah Wood, Kill The Noise, Verne Troyer, Alicia Malone, Kristian Harloff &amp; Mark Ellis, and Dillon Francis. 

On June 27, 2018 the duo officially cut ties with ETC News and launched a new YouTube channel known as ''Internet Today'', taking many shows from ETC and continuing them there.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} ''ETC Daily'' was renamed to ''Internet Today'' and ''T.U.G.S.'' was officially canceled.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} The ''ETC Podcast'' was reworked into ''Idiots Watching Anime'', a full series version of a few episodes they did of the ''ETC Podcast'' where the two hosts watched a few episodes of ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', a show they were both unfamiliar with, and discussed it with the friends who suggested the episodes.

===Machinima Live===
Machinima previously held livestreams on the ''Machinima Live'' YouTube channel. Currently, the network streams on [[Twitch (website)|Twitch]], with their channel hosting gameplay events, convention coverage, and more. ''Machinima Live'' also had 24-hour live streams, such as one that took place in 2010 after the release of ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]''. Machinima staff, directors, and guests took part in playing the game in four-hour shifts in attempt to reach 15th prestige. A similar event also occurred after the release of ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidegamingdaily.com/2010/11/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-live-stream/ |last=Fassino |first=Justin |title=Machinima - Call of Duty Black Ops Live Stream |publisher=Machinima |accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Machinima VS===
In 2012, Machinima branched out to competitive side of gaming with the inclusion of ''Machinima VS'', a channel featuring event coverage from some top-ranked players, teams, and casters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/machinimavs |title='&amp;#39;'YouTube'&amp;#39;': '&amp;#39;Machinima VS'&amp;#39; |publisher=Youtube.com |accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as Machinima's esports channel. The channel has since become inactive.

===Machinima Respawn===
On December 7, 2009, the ''Machinima Respawn'' channel was launched as Machinima's gameplay focused channel. It had a host of shows about games and related topics as well as the show ''Respawn'' hosted by [[Adam Montoya]], Scott Robison, and Shaun Hutchinson. ''Inbox'' was a later show that gained a cult following for its comedy and the funny personalities of the hosts Scott Fisher and Scott Robison. At one point ''Machinima Respawn'' was the most subscribed channel on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesocialmediamonthly.com/25-most-social-youtube-channels-worldwide-dominated-by-gamers-vloggers-webisodes/|title=25 Most Social YouTube Channels Worldwide Dominated by Gamers, Vloggers &amp; Webisodes - The Social Media Monthly|date=17 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to budget cuts at Machinima, the lack of views of the newer programming on ''Respawn'' in later years, and the departure of Scott Robison, Shaun Hutchinson and Adam Montoya along with Scott Fisher, ''Machinima Respawn'' was discontinued, not having been active since February 22, 2015. It has since been absorbed into Machinima Realm, which was later renamed ''Realm Games''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/machinima-cuts-staff-shuts-some-channels-after-new-financing-exclusive-1201438241/|title=Machinima Cuts Staff, Shuts Some Channels After New Financing (Exclusive)|first=Andrew|last=Wallenstein|date=20 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Realm Games===
Originally launched as ''Machinima Realm'', ''Realm Games'' is Machinima's gameplay-focused channel. Originally only focusing on [[
Massively multiplayer online game|MMO's]] and [[Real-time strategy]] games among other genres, it has since become Machinima's primary hub for all their gameplay content after the closure of ''Machinima Respawn.'' It is currently being managed by Machinima employee Shane, otherwise known as Shibby2142, and hosts a variety of content focusing on several different games, mostly ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' and ''[[League of Legends]]'' recently.

The series initially ended after its third season, with a movie titled ''Endgame'', but was later spun-off as ''Arby 'n' the Chief in LA'' by Machinima. Due to the poor reception of ''In LA'', Graham brought back the show for a fourth season that ignored the events of ''in LA'' and ''Endgame'' and instead took place after the third season. Graham sought to end the show again with its seventh season, which ended on August 17, 2013. However, on October 6, 2014, Jon Graham revealed that he was contemplating producing an additional season, feeling dissatisfied at the original ending he created.

Machinima's partnership with [[Google]] includes Google's £30 million investment in Machinima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Forbes - Google invests in Machinima sees financial return|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/connieguglielmo/2012/05/21/google-invests-in-machinima-sees-financial-return/ | first=Connie | last=Guglielmo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
As a [[Multi Channel Network]], Machinima has over 5,000 partners worldwide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Affiliates - Machinima|url=http://www.machinima.com/affiliates|publisher=Machinima|accessdate=15 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212061141/http://www.machinima.com/affiliates|archivedate=12 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  who are contracted to produce video content under the Machinima brand.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; The company has been criticised for the use of [[Perpetual access|perpetual contracts]].&lt;ref name="MarsdenTheIndependent"&gt;{{cite news|last=Marsden|first=Rhodri|title=Channels spawned by YouTube are making a fortune but are the people making the videos missing out?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/channels-spawned-by-youtube-are-making-a-fortune-but-are-the-people-making-the-videos-missing-out-8464004.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=15 February 2013|location=London|date=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Vacas, known to the YouTube community as 'Braindeadly', attracted media attention in January 2013 over contractual issues with Machinima.&lt;ref name="HoustonPress"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stuart|first=Tessa|title=Rage Against Machinima|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2013-01-10/culture/youtube-stars-networks-money/full/|publisher=Houston Press|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of his contract, Machinima was permitted to place advertisements on Vacas's videos and in return he would receive a percentage of the profits generated.&lt;ref name=HoustonPress/&gt; However, the contract also disclosed that it existed "in perpetuity"&lt;ref name=MarsdenTheIndependent/&gt; meaning Machinima would hold the rights to any content created by Vacas, published on his partnered YouTube channel, in his lifetime, a detail Vacas failed to read.&lt;ref name=MarsdenTheIndependent/&gt;

In January 2014, Machinima was alleged to be paying its YouTube video partners for showing Xbox One content.  According to reports, the content must be at least 30 seconds long and the Xbox One must be mentioned by name. An accompanying legal agreement also states that the partner "may not say anything negative or disparaging about Machinima, Xbox One, or any of its games". Additionally, the agreement states that the video producer must keep the details of the promotional agreement confidential, or they do not qualify for the promotional payment. Videos participating in this promotion tag their videos with the tag: XB1M13. Microsoft claims that it had no knowledge of the promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/stealth-marketing-microsoft-paying-youtubers-for-xbox-one-mentions/|title=Stealth marketing: Microsoft paying YouTubers for Xbox One mentions [updated]|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machinima has faced criticism from YouTube members and viewers for a lack of transparency with its associates, placing advertisements on their associate channels' videos without permission, and a lack of transparency on the revenues side. One associate member, Clash, also criticised Machinima for insensitively placing an ad on a video dedicated to his ailing dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Good|first=Owen|title=YouTuber Blasts Machinima As The ContentID Controversy Grinds On (Update)|url=http://kotaku.com/http-www-youtube-com-watch-v-nhj0pxlogly-the-controve-1495496631|publisher=Kotaku}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|nHJ0pxLogLY|A Video For Machinima}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, 2015, Machinima agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it engaged in deceptive advertising by paying “influencers” to post YouTube videos endorsing Microsoft’s Xbox One system and several games. The FTC claimed that the influencers failed to adequately disclose that they were being paid for their seemingly objective opinions. Under the proposed settlement, Machinima was prohibited from similar deceptive conduct in the future, and it was required to ensure its influencers clearly disclosed when they are compensated for their endorsements. According to the FTC’s complaint, Machinima and its influencers were part of an Xbox One marketing campaign managed by Microsoft’s advertising agency, Starcom MediaVest Group. Machinima guaranteed Starcom that the influencer videos would be viewed at least 19 million times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/youtube-network-deceived-customers-with-paid-for-x/1100-6430268/|title=YouTube Network "Deceived Customers" With Paid-For Xbox One Videos|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=September 2, 2015|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2018, ''Arby 'N' The Chief'' creator Jon Graham tweeted that most of the series was removed from Machinima's YouTube channel for unspecified reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/jcjgraham/status/994382240351072256|title=Jon Graham on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Meowth's Party''''' is the 7th ending theme song of the [[Pokemon (TV series)|Pokemon anime series]]. It was used in the original Japanese versions of episodes 117 through 141. It first gained exposure internationally, when it was recreated as an interactive technical demo showcased at the 2000 [[Nintendo Space World]] convention, demonstrating the [[GameCube]]'s graphic capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/083/083988p1.html |title=IGN: Meowth's Party Movie |publisher=Cube.ign.com |author=IGN Staff |date= |accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the demo, Team Rocket's [[Meowth]] is seen entertaining guests at a party with his red guitar. The demo featured [[Pokémon]] from the ''Red'', ''Blue'' (''Green'' in Japan), ''Gold'' and ''Silver'' versions of the Pokémon video games. The demo was created by the same team who created ''[[Pokémon Stadium]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]].

==Summary==
[[File:Meowth Party.jpg|thumb|A screenshot of [[Meowth]] and his red [[Fender Stratocaster]].]]
Meowth is seen dancing with his associates, [[Team Rocket (anime)|Team Rocket]] members Jessie (Musashi in the original Japanese version) and James (Kojiro), and their two Pokémon, [[Arbok]] and [[Weezing]] (Matadogasu). In both the ending sequence, and the tech demo, he is voiced by [[Inuko Inuyama]], who voices the character in the Japanese version of the anime series (where the character is known as ''Nyarth''). In the United States, [[Kids' WB!]] aired the ending in its original Japanese after one episode, and aired an English dub of the song in the next. The English dub also features [[Maddie Blaustein]] as Meowth, [[Rachel Lillis]] as Jessie, and [[Eric Stuart]] as James, who were voicing their respective characters in the series at the time. Neither ending was ever aired again on the network.&lt;ref name="Pokezam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokezam.com/games/meowth/|title=Meowth's Party|accessdate= 2009-01-23|publisher=Pokezam.com}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The animation for both versions was composed in 3-D computer graphics, with the exception of [[Jessie and James]], who, in the ending sequence, remain as 2-D cels in the style of ''[[Paper Mario]]'' and ''[[PaRappa the Rapper]]''.

Meowth sings the song at his party in the ''[[Pokémon]]'' episode titled ''Pichu Bros. in Party Panic'', a special episode only available for viewing on the [[GameCube]] game [[Pokémon Channel]]. Unlike the rest of the episode, this section uses 3-D computer graphics and Meowth's actions are selected randomly for each viewing.

In ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', there is a trophy of Meowth holding a red guitar. The character model is the same as the Meowth from ''Meowth's Party''. The description also mentions ''Meowth's Party'' and even gives a brief explanation about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/083/083990p1.html |title=IGN: Meowth's Party Impressions and Shots |publisher=cube.ign.com |author=IGN Staff |date= |accessdate=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==CD single==
'''''Meowth's Party''''' ('''ニャースのパーティ''' ''Nyarth's Party'') is a mini CD single that was released on October 27, 1999 in Japan. The lyrics were by Akihito Toda, the songs were composed and arranged by [[Hirokazu Tanaka]].

Amazon.com has a listing with information on the single but it is usually out of stock on it. Packaged with the single is a small poster with a screenshot from the ending sequence and the lyrics to the songs. There is also a 41 second long fifth track that isn't listed on the packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectorscache.com/storemodules/ProductDetails.aspx?productID=11971&amp;CategoryID=206&amp;tabindex=&amp;tabid=&amp;Page= |title=Collector's Cache: Meowth's Party promo w/mini CD |publisher=www.collectorscache.com |accessdate=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ministry of Testing''', also referred to as the '''MoT''', is a global [[software testing]] community that was founded by Rosie Sherry, who was longlisted for most influential woman in UK tech by [[Computer Weekly]] in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.computerweekly.com/news/450421935/Most-influential-women-in-UK-tech-The-2017-longlist |title=Most influenctial women in UK tech the 2017 longlist |last=McDonald |first=Clare |date=4 June 2017 |website= |publisher=Computer Weekly |access-date=9 May 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. MoT started out as a UK-based internet forum for software testers and quickly grew into an independent business that provides software testing conferences and Meetups around the world, and an [[Virtual learning environment|online learning platform]] dedicated to the craft of software testing &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/how-i-built-an-80k-mo-business-by-listening-to-my-audience-596212dcdc |title=How I Built an $80k/mo Business by Listening to My Audience |last=Sherry |first=Rosie |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=4 April 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Members of the Ministry of Testing community consist of software testers and those working in [[software quality]]. The community created by Ministry of Testing aims to get its participants sharing innovative practises and ideas around software testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gr.pcmag.com/software-testing/29708/news/to-1o-meetup-tou-ministry-of-testing-athens-einai-gegonos |title=Το 1ο Meetup του Ministry of Testing Athens είναι γεγονός |accessdate=9 May 2018 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date=2 February 2018 |work= |publisher=PC Mag Greece}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer Scientists at the [[University of Maryland]] used Ministry of Testing (along with organisations) to recruit software testers for a study into identifying vulnerabilities in software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323425772_Hackers_vs_Testers_A_Comparison_of_Software_Vulnerability_Discovery_Processes |title=Hackers vs. Testers: A Comparison of Software Vulnerability Discovery Processes |last1=Votipka |first1=Daniel |author-link1= |last2=Stevens |first2=Rock |author-link2= |last3=Redmiles| first3=Elissa| date=2016 |publisher= |book-title= |pages= |location=San Francisco, California, USA |conference=IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multi-image''' is the now largely obsolete practice and business of using [[135 film|35mm]] [[Photographic slide|slides]] ([[diapositive]]s) projected by single or multiple [[slide projector]]s onto one or more screens in synchronization with an [[Soundtrack|audio]] [[voice-over]] or music track. Multi-image productions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Images, Images, Images: The Book of Programmed Multi-Image Production|last1=Kenny|first1=Michael F.|last2=Schmitt|first2=Raymond F.|publisher=[[Eastman Kodak]]|location=New York|year=1983|ISBN=978-0-87985-327-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also known as multi-image slide presentations, [[Slideshows|slide shows]] and [[diaporama]]s and are a specific form of [[multimedia]] or [[audio-visual]] production.

[[File:Multi-Image PanProjection.png|right|alt=An illustration of how slides overlap to create a panorama and how the soft-edge density masks are aligned.|Soft-edge masking and overlap for projected panoramas.]]

One of the hallmarks of multi-image was the use of the wide screen [[panorama]]. Precisely overlapping slides were placed in slide mounts with soft-edge [[Masking (in art)|density masks]]; when the resulting images were projected, the images would blend seamlessly on the screen to create the panorama. By [[cut (transition)|cutting]] and [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolving]] between images in the projectors, animation effects were created in the panorama format.

The term ''multi-image'' is sometimes used to describe digital photo image computer programs that combine or change images on-screen, for photo [[Photomontage|montages]], and [[image stitching]].

==Description==
Multi-image presentations were a unique form of communication to audiences of various sizes, to meet a variety of communication and entertainment needs. The use of projected photographic images such as [[lantern slide]]s for entertainment and instruction dates to the early 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/1256/Projection.html|title=Projection|author=Rose, Robert|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[L. Frank Baum]] had a traveling show (1908) that included slides, film, and actors describing the [[Land of Oz]]. Throughout the years improvements in technology took place and applications for multi-image continued to expand. During the 1960s, automated synchronized audio and slides modules became more common and found use in instructional environments.

In general, multi-image can be defined as being:
* Based largely on analog production tools and technologies including art and audio production and film-based photography. 35mm slide [[Photographic film|film]] has high resolution and color range and are based on [[Film grain|grain]] and dye clouds rather than on a fixed [[Rasterisation|raster]] pattern, which when projected often is perceived&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/vitale/digital-projection/|title=Projecting Digital 'Slide' Images|author=Vitale, Timothy J.|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as being more realistic, uniform, and detailed than digital images. Line density for 35mm film is up to 3850 lines per inch, which no video projection technology can match.
* [[Multi-disciplinary]] in terms of the types of skills required to create and stage multi-image presentations.
* Venue driven; multi-image presentations had specific requirements for the equipment and spaces they were intended for and presented in.

==Multi-image business==
Multi-image as a business thrived during the 1970s and 1980s. Multi-image presentations ranged from single projector shows run by projector-viewer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/abstracts/Education/Caramate-Projectors-Provide-an-Economical-Educational-Tool-Using-Media-Printers-for-the-Educational-.html Caramate Projectors Provide an Economical Educational Tool]&lt;/ref&gt; to large events for business meetings and conventions where multiple shows would be presented and often were [[Projection screen|rear-projected]] by 24 or more projectors.

Creating and presenting multi-image productions involved a relatively large number of specialized skills, equipment, and facilities to produce. During the height of multi-image, a number of types of businesses were directly engaged in the industry which employed thousands of specialists that ranged from producers and designers, writers, artists, [[typesetter]]s, photographers, photo lab technicians, audio technicians, programmers, staging specialists as well as others associated with these disciplines.

[[Image:Multi Image AMI GoldTour.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Promotional slide for the AMI Gold Tour, 1983.|AMI Gold Tour promotion.]]
A professional organization, the Association for Multi-image International (AMI),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.trademarkia.com/company-association-for-multiimage-100743-page-1-2|title=Trademark for The Association for Multi-Image|accessdate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created and had numerous active chapters around the world. The AMI held an annual convention and multi-image competition. Local chapters of AMI in various cities also held regional competitions.

An entire industry grew around supplying the tools and equipment needed to supply and support multi-image production.
* Corporations who manufactured and sold basic equipment and materials used in the production of multi-image, such as 35mm slide projectors, film, slide mounts, soft-edge masks and other items. The list of suppliers for the multi-image industry was extensive with a number of companies attaining international importance for the products they produced, including [[Eastman Kodak]], Wess Slide Mounts, Chief Manufacturing, Navitar and Schneider Optics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.schneideroptics.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* Manufacturers of highly specialized multi-image equipment such as optical slide cameras and slide projector programming hardware. Precise camera systems were developed for the multi-image market featuring [[pin registration|pin-registered]] film movements capable of making multiple exposures, controlled [[Backlighting (lighting design)|backlit]] color light sources, motorized multi-axis compounds for precise positioning of artwork, and long-roll film loads. Slide projector programming computers and dissolve equipment and software was developed to synchronize the slides with the audio by providing precise time control over slide tray positioning and lamp fade rates needed to create multi-image animation. Programmer and camera manufacturers included Audio Visual Labs, Electrosonic, Clearlight Inc. Spindler &amp; Sauppe,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Multi-image Media|author=Bullough, Robert V.|publisher=Educational Technology|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marron Carrel and Forox.

Driven by changes in technology and by economic considerations, multi-image has been replaced by video presentations and by readily available computer based technologies such as laptop computers running [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] and projecting through [[Video projector|digital projectors]]. Visual presentation and photo and graphics editing software programs have allowed a wider range of communicators quick, flexible, and easy access to the tools and technologies needed to create presentations. [[Digital photography]] has reduced the need for laboratory services and complex equipment. The expansion and ease of use of desktop computing brought a close to the multi-image industry.

==Multi-image production technologies==
[[File:Multi-image workflow.jpg|thumb|right|Typical [[workflow]] for multi-image production]]

The art and business of multi-image drew from many older existing technologies. When a multi-image project was initiated, various overall management roles were required to provide direction, planning, and [[project management]]. These roles generally involved the activities similar to those found in other media industries, such as creative, visual, and technical directors, producers, [[Production management (theater)|production managers]], and writers.

Often individuals with the various production skills would fill these roles as well as performing their production roles. Multi-image productions in general were deadline driven and it was common that the production process would be non-linear, allowing for multiple activities to take place with overlapping roles.

===Art and design===
The visual quality of a presentation was based on using photographs or artwork created for use in the presentation as source material. 35mm slides could be used directly as they were originally taken. Often the original photographs were masked or duplicated for positioning and sizing. In some instances, 35mm cameras modified for pin-registration were used to create animated sequences.

Through the use of multiple projectors set up to project onto a screen area, over-projected images could be designed as animations. Typical multi-image animation effects included fading from one photograph or graphic to another, progressively building text to form a completed statement, inserting images or graphics into frames or windows on screen, step by step movement of images across the screen area, and [[Superimpose|superimposing]] text or images onto a background. The visual effects were synchronized to music or voice and based on the capabilities and limitations of the slide projectors and dissolve units.

Artwork produced for multi-image presentations in general was based on one of two forms of top-lit reflective copy artwork:
# Materials that were produced and copied as flat art directly to slides to be used in the production, or
# [[color separation|Color]]- or image-separated and layered photomechanical art that would be copied to high-contrast masks which were then used to create slides. This second process was called optical slide printing and was based on many of the basic principles from photomechanical [[Pre-press|prepress]] art used in [[offset printing]], silk-screen printing, and [[cel animation]].

Flat art was created by using a variety of standard graphic illustration techniques, using [[Technical pen|pen]] and ink, [[airbrush]], paints, from [[Clipart|clip art]], colored paper, transfer lettering such as [[Letraset]], and by copying from existing materials on a [[copy stand]] or on optical slide camera. [[Traditional animation|Cel art]], such as found in [[cel animation]], was also used.

Art used in optical slide printing was based on the use of high-contrast photomechanical materials such as photomechanical transfers,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.printingtips.com/email-term/t--1746/photomechanical-transfer.asp&lt;/ref&gt; black and white type, [[rubylith]] and other materials. Phototypesetting was done by a variety of means including the Visual Graphics Corporation PhotoTypositor&lt;ref&gt;http://bellsouthpwp2.net/b/c/bcarberry/tp.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Compugraphic]] EditWriter&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prepressure.com/library/prepress-history/1970-1979&lt;/ref&gt; at companies that specialized in providing typography. When making artwork for multi-image presentations, photographs, [[Reversal film|transparencies]], and film images or [[continuous tone]] film or airbrushed masks could also be used as part of the camera-ready artwork.

The color or image separated layers of artwork were pin-registered using a variety of standard [[registration pin|pin systems]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.sparetimelabs.com/animato/animato/pegbar/pegs.html|title=Peg bars, Animation Disk &amp; Desk|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 1/4-inch, Oxberry, and Acme. The artwork was created on a [[light table]] or animation disc&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://animation-studio-stuff.blogspot.com/2009/05/purchasing-animation-disc.html|title=Animation Stuff for Students: Purchasing an Animation Disk|author=Nethery, David|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide back lighting.

Often the art was created based on a grid system. A copy of the optical slide camera grid or [[reticle]] was used to align the artwork elements. The use of the grid for alignment could be used to accurately position images and art elements throughout the process from the creation of the artwork to the final projected images. This process also allowed layers of the artwork to be interchangeable from slide to slide, images or graphic elements could be carefully placed on the screen relative to other images, and for combining parts of images or graphics by separate slides as in an animated sequence.

===Audio production===
The audio track of a multi-image show provided a framework for the timing of the presentation and for the sequencing and animations of the slides. These were produced generally on {{frac|1|4}}-inch audio tape on [[Multitrack recording|multi-track tape recorders]] such as models by [[Tascam]], [[TEAC Corporation|TEAC]], [[Sony]], [[Fostex]] and [[Crown International|Crown]], which allowed for having two tracks or channels for [[stereophonic sound|stereo sound]] and one for the synchronization or [[click track]] which was used to encode and playback the signals for the dissolve units. The audio and synchronization tracks were normally separated by a blank track to prevent any carryover of the synchronization cues into the audio playback.
Audio editing of the music or voice-over was done manually to create a [[Studio recording#The process|scratch track]], usually with a cutting block and tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.tpub.com/journalist/165.htm|title=Editing Audiotape|publisher=Integrated Publishing|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the audio edits were completed, the final version would be copied onto another tape; either to {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;inch, cassette or other format so that there tape used to run the presentation would be a fresh uncut tape.

As productions became more sophisticated, [[multitrack recording|16- and 24-track]] recording processes were used to create elaborate soundtracks and four-channel [[surround sound]] for large business theatre environments. In productions such as the [[Maritz, LLC|Maritz]]-produced car announcement shows for [[General Motors|GM]] and [[Ford Motor Company]], 16-track recorders were used for playback onsite. These 2-inch showtapes would contain extra tracks to support the vocals for a live cast onstage, as well as additional string-section support for the live orchestra and a [[click track]] to cue the conductor, in order to maintain synchronization between the cast, orchestra and on-screen visuals.

===Printing with light===
Completed artwork was copied under top lights on a pin-registered camera on a high contrast film such as Kodaline or Kodalith to create 35mm [[Matte (filmmaking)|mattes]] used in the optical slide printing process. When needed, pin-registered positive mattes known as countermattes were made by contact printing from the mattes. When a set of mattes and countermates were completed, the optical slide camera was used to assemble the separate images onto a single frame of film by making multiple exposures through the mattes. Accuracy in positioning the separate elements of the slide is made possible by the film [[Film perforations|sprockets]], which were also used to position the finished color slides and masks in the slide mounts.

[[Image:Maron1600Table.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Maron 1600 camera table, 12-field compound, and colorhead.|Maron 1600 camera table, large format 12-field compound, and colorhead.]]

Copy cameras and optical slide cameras usually had motorized movement of the camera on the column toward and away from the table to allow for resizing the image on the camera on the Z-axis.

Fully functional optical slide cameras had compounds for positioning both artwork and the mattes relative to the lens and camera head. A compound could move left to right (horizontal) X-axis and top to bottom (vertical) Y-axis movement as well as rotate (theta-axis). Compounds were often motorized with [[stepper motor|micro-stepping motors]] to allow for smooth programmable and repeatable positioning. Higher end optical slide cameras had the ability to create and save programs.

Light sources for copying artwork generally were [[Halogen lamp|quartz halogen]] lights. Backlighting was generally provided by the use a darkroom [[Enlarger|photographic enlarger]] colorhead modified for use with the camera. This form of controlled light provide colored light balanced for the color sensitivity of the film used and provided color light for the separate exposures that are made through the mattes.

The optical slide camera could be used to create a number of types of slides and special effects commonly used in multi-image presentations:
* Duplicates: copies of transparencies
* Copy slides: slides made by top-light copying of artwork or illustrations
* Title burns: made by making multiple exposures through a series of mattes, such as text slides
* Color on color slides: Similar to burn slides but with a color background, often requiring countermattes
* Step and repeat: Using a compound, making a series of exposures where the compound is moved between each exposure
* Movements: long exposures made from a backlit matte, the shutter is open while the compound and the camera move the matte creating a streaking effect
* Glow effects: using a light diffusing material while exposing the backlight through a matte to create soft edges around the image on the matte
* Filter effects: using color, star and other types of camera filters for special effects
* Image effects: by either manipulating the mattes and countermattes of by positioning transparencies while duplicating them; posterizations, inserts, split frames, and panoramas
* Camera effects: Some optical slide cameras have the capabilities for in-camera mattes, [[bi-pack]]ing, and [[Rotoscope|rotoscoping]]

Slides created by these methods and combinations of these methods were made to align and animate when projected, creating what was considered the visual multi-image experience.

====Film processing====
[[Photographic processing|Film processing]] requires specific facilities, equipment, and skill needed to maintain consistent results. Film processors for developing transparency film require maintaining processing control which was based on good practices in chemical mixing and storage, accurate time, temperature and agitation during the process and the use of control strips. Control strips were run with the film and read on a [[densitometer]] to determine their variation from a standard so that corrections could be made

====Computer graphics====
The use of computer graphics replaced much of the manual activity in creating the artwork and converting the art into slides. Service bureaus offering production work from large workstations such as [[Dicomed]] and [[Genigraphics]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genigraphics.org/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; dominated larger markets. Smaller producers using desktop software such as [[Photoshop]], [[Adobe Persuasion|Persuasion]], [[Harvard Graphics]] and PowerPoint allowed many slide producers to quickly create slides which were imaged on [[film recorder]]s such as Management Graphics, Lasergraphics, [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]], [[Celco]], and CCG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccg-germany.com/index.php/about-us |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203042850/http://www.ccg-germany.com/index.php/about-us |archivedate=3 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assembly and programming===
Completed slides were mounted into pin-registered slide mounts. Three or more pieces of film could be mounted into a slide mount which allowed slides to contain the image film chip and masks to allow for inserting and over-projecting. Slides were edited and arranged for programming on light tables.

AVL Eagle Genesis computers in foreground; background, from left: Brad Smith (art director), Sung Lee (producer/art director), Bob Kassal (executive producer), Paul 'PJ' Jackson (producer/programmer). Produced by Maritz Communications, 1987, Detroit, MI]] Programming of multi-projector multi-image shows was generally done on one of several systems such as Arion, [[Eagle Computer|Audio-Visual Laboratories]] (AVL), Electrosonic, Clearlight,&lt;ref name="clearlight"&gt;http://2live4.com/clearlight.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Dataton,&lt;ref name="dataton"&gt;http://www.dataton.com/&lt;/ref&gt; UAV, Spindler-Sauppe and Multivision. Slides were placed in projector trays, projectors were set up on a "grid" so that alignment was made of the projectors onto the screen area. The programming itself was done on a system that allowed for input by the programmer and dissolve units&lt;ref&gt;http://www.honda600coupe.com/random/AVL/AVL_Genesis_Procall_X.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which were attached to the projectors and controlled the functions of the projectors based on the programming instructions. Programming could also be used to control room lights, rewind of the audio tape and resetting of the projectors, and to trigger other effects that might be used in the presentation, such as a [[strobe light]].

There were two basic slide projector programming controls: a set of instructions to position the slide in the projector and a set of instructions for the slide projector lamp. These controls would be used to define the cues. The cues would often designate an action for more than one projector such as with a [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolve]] between two slides which would require simultaneously [[Fade (filmmaking)|fading]] up on one lamp and fading down another lamp. Similar commands were used to control motion-picture projectors, as well as auxiliary controls for lighting and effects, etc.

|-
| Forward
| Lifts the current slide from the projector gate into the slide tray, rotates the tray one position and drops the next slide into the gate. During this process a shutter at the slide gate in the projector is used prevent projecting while the lamp remains lit. The average time to cycle from slide to slide varies from 0.9 to 1.5 seconds, depending on the projector.
|-
| No movement
| The slide projector is instructed to make no tray move during a cue or series of cues. On AVL systems, this is termed an "alt", and embedded into a lamp command.
|-
| Reverse
| Lifts the current slide from the projector gate into the slide tray, rotates the tray one position in reverse and drops the previous slide into the gate. During the cycle the shutter will close and open in the same manner as a forward movement.
|-
| Use of shutter
| The slide projector shutter can be controlled to block light without controlling voltage to the lamp. The shutter cycle time varies from projector to projector, averaging at about 0.2 seconds to cycle from open to closed.

! Projector&amp;nbsp;Lamp
! colspan="2" | Multi-image programming effects based on lamp intensity
|-
| Lamp on and off
| The projector lamp can be instructed to turn on and off. When programmed one or more projectors, can be made to produce several basic effects including:
* Cut – Lamp is turned on or off quickly. When two projectors are involved, the lamp in one projector is turned off while the lamp in a second is turned, made to appear that these two actions are made at the same time. A cue based on a cut will include a slide tray advance, unless designated an "alt" (see Alternate).
* Hard Cut – By first using the slide projector shutter, the transition between two projectors can be made faster than by controlling the lamp on and off. A visible "shutter chop" can be seen, depending on the shutter speed of the projector involved.
* Soft Cut – Usually a term applied to a fast dissolve that takes place in less than a second.
* Alternate – Appears as a cut, but with no slide tray advance.
* Fast Alternate – As above, but allowing the programmer to create flickering effects while the lamp intensity fades up or down.
|-
| Lamp Fade
|
* Fade – A timed, controlled operation where the projector lamp is either turned on or off over a set period of time, producing the effect of the slide image slowly appearing or disappearing on the screen.
* 
* Dissolve – A timed crossfading of two or more projectors. Dissolves can be programmed to occur as quickly as one second, or as slow as 32 seconds.
* Freeze – During a fade process, the intensity or light output of the lamp in any projector can be stopped in time at a given light intensity for a given period of time. This capability can be used to produce complex multi-projector dissolves. Also, it allows for a projected background to be "faded back" while a brighter image is superimposed.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
!colspan="2" | Other Commands
|-
| Timing
|
* Wait X – Add timing to a sequence during programming either to add padding to a programmed effect or as a temporary timing pad that will be resolved as the programming is completed. The 'X' represents a time value, expressed in seconds and hundredths of seconds.
* Time X – Instructing a programmed event or sequence of events to begin at the time read from the timecode track of a prerecorded tape. The 'X' represents a time value, expressed in hours, minutes, seconds and hundredths of seconds, or hours, minutes, seconds and [[SMPTE]] video frames. During programming, the computer reads the incoming timecode. With the program list resting at a Time X cue, a snapshot of the incoming timecode is recorded when the Enter key is struck.
|-
| Other effects
|
* Loop Load/Loop Go/Loop Stop – Loads a sequence of commands to be repeated continuously until instructed to stop. During a Loop sequence, the programming computer is freed-up to control other projectors.
* Blink Alt/Blink Load/Blink Go/Blink Stop – Loads a sequence of blink commands to be repeated continuously until instructed to stop. A series of projectors can be included, with lamp fade up/down options available, with the ability to preprogram cycle-animation into a Blink sequence. During a Blink sequence, the programming computer is freed-up to control other projectors.
|}

Through synchronizing the audio and the visual effects and combining visual slide effects, the programming process could create a single continuous show that was saved to memory. Once the programming was completed, the most common way to preserve the programming information was to record the programming cues onto the audio track so that the show could be run synchronized with the audio playback. In some situations, data would be contained in the programming computer (stored either on an internal [[hard disk drive]] or a [[floppy disk]]), and the events would be triggered by a [[timecode]] track on the audio tape.

As multi-image programming devices progressed to [[digital computers]] and became more sophisticated in the late 1970s, more programming features were added. Complex looping effects, independent cycling allowing background animation over foreground effects, comprehensive control of [[Movie projector|motion picture projectors]], control of (and by) video devices and other peripheral devices, and the use of [[SMPTE timecode]] for synchronization became commonplace. Multiply-exposed [[Optical effect#Matting|optical effects]] and the use of [[computer-generated imagery]] allowed the medium to emerge, briefly, as an art form. The use of [[Multitrack recording|multitrack]] audio playback enhanced the experience and provided for [[surround sound]].

===On the road===
Completed multi-image productions were presented in a variety of venues ranging from temporary one-on-one settings to semi-permanent [[world's fair]] pavilions and museum exhibitions. Large multi-projector multi-image presentations required adequate projection space which was often from behind the screen for rear-screen projection. Setting up large show required control over the room lighting and often involved drapes and scaffolds.

The actual presentations often were considered to be business theater, incorporating special effects such as [[pyrotechnics]], breakaway screens, live entertainment, even breakaway screens such as having a vehicle crash through the screen to introduce a new model truck.

'''Nitroglycerin''' ('''NG'''), also known as '''nitroglycerine''', '''trinitroglycerin''' ('''TNG'''), '''nitro''', '''glyceryl trinitrate''' ('''GTN'''), or '''1,2,3-trinitroxypropane''', is a dense, colorless, oily, [[explosive]] liquid most commonly produced by [[nitration|nitrating]] [[glycerol]] with [[white fuming nitric acid]] under conditions appropriate to the formation of the nitric acid [[ester]]. Chemically, the substance is an [[organic nitrate]] compound rather than a [[nitro compound]], yet the traditional name is often retained. Invented in 1847, nitroglycerin has been used as an active ingredient in the manufacture of [[explosive]]s, mostly [[dynamite]], and as such it is employed in the [[construction]], [[demolition]], and [[mining]] industries. Since the 1880s, it has been used by the military as an active ingredient, and a gelatinizer for [[nitrocellulose]], in some solid [[propellant]]s, such as [[cordite]] and [[ballistite]].

Nitroglycerin is a major component in double-based [[smokeless gunpowder]]s used by [[handloading|reloaders]]. Combined with [[nitrocellulose]],  hundreds of powder combinations are used by rifle, pistol, and shotgun reloaders.

[[glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|In medicine]] for over 130 years, nitroglycerin has been used as a potent [[vasodilator]] (dilation of the vascular system) to treat [[heart]] conditions, such as [[angina pectoris]] and [[chronic heart failure]]. Though it was previously known that these beneficial effects are due to nitroglycerin being converted to [[nitric oxide]], a potent venodilator, the enzyme for this conversion was not discovered to be mitochondrial [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] ([[ALDH2]]) until 2002.&lt;ref name="Chen et al. 2005 12159–12164"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | year = 2005 | volume = 102 | pages = 12159–12164 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0503723102 | pmid = 16103363 | last2 = Foster | first2 = M.

== History ==
Nitroglycerin was the first practical explosive produced that was stronger than [[black powder]]. It was first synthesized by the Italian [[chemist]] [[Ascanio Sobrero]] in 1847, working under [[Théophile-Jules Pelouze]] at the [[University of Turin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sobrero |first=Ascagne |date=1847 |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k29812/f247.item.zoom |title=Sur plusieur composés détonants produits avec l'acide nitrique et le sucre, la dextrine, la lactine, la mannite et la glycérine |trans-title=On several detonating compounds produced with nitric acid and sugar, dextrin, lactose, mannitol, and glycerin |journal=Comptes rendus |volume=24 |pages=247–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sobrero initially called his discovery ''pyroglycerine'' and warned vigorously against its use as an explosive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sobrero |first=Ascanio |date=1849 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=iau.31858045931643;view=1up;seq=283 |title=Sopra alcuni nuovi composti fulminanti ottenuti col mezzo dell’azione dell’acido nitrico sulle sostante organiche vegetali |trans-title=On some new explosive products obtained by the action of nitric acid on some vegetable organic substances |journal=Memorie della Reale Accademia delle Scienze di Torino (2nd series) |volume=10 |pages=195–201}} On p. 197, Sobrero names nitroglycerin "pyroglycerine":
:"Quelle gocciole costituiscono il corpo nuovo di cui descriverò ora le proprietà, e che chiamerò ''Piroglicerina''."  (Those drops constitute the new substance whose properties I will now describe, and which I will call "pyroglycerine".)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitroglycerin was later adopted as a commercially useful explosive by [[Alfred Nobel]], who experimented with safer ways to handle the dangerous compound after his younger brother, [[Emil Oskar Nobel]], and several factory workers were killed in an explosion at the Nobels' armaments factory in 1864 in [[Heleneborg]], Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/industrial/articles/vinterviken/emil.html |website=NobelPrize.org |title=Emil Nobel |access-date=6 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115085417/http://nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/industrial/articles/vinterviken/emil.html |archive-date=15 January 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One year later, Nobel founded [[Dynamit Nobel AG|Alfred Nobel and Company]] in Germany and built an isolated factory in the [[Krümmel]] hills of [[Geesthacht]] near [[Hamburg]]. This business exported a liquid combination of nitroglycerin and [[gunpowder]] called "Blasting Oil", but this was extremely unstable and difficult to handle, as evidenced in numerous catastrophes. The buildings of the Krümmel factory were destroyed twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/industrial/articles/krummel/index.html |website=NobelPrize.org |title=Krümmel |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710005656/http://nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/industrial/articles/krummel/index.html |archive-date=10 July 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1866, three crates of nitroglycerin were shipped to [[California]] for the [[Central Pacific Railroad]], which planned to experiment with it as a blasting explosive to expedite the construction of the {{convert|1659|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[Donner Pass#Railroad &amp; Donner Pass|Summit Tunnel]] through the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada Mountains]]. One of the crates exploded, destroying a [[Wells Fargo]] company office in [[San Francisco]] and killing 15 people. This led to a complete ban on the transportation of liquid nitroglycerin in California. The on-site manufacture of nitroglycerin was thus required for the remaining hard-rock [[drilling and blasting]] required for the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/tcrr/peopleevents/e_nitro.html |title=Transcontinental Railroad – People &amp; Events: Nitroglycerin |website=[[American Experience]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liquid nitroglycerin was widely banned elsewhere, as well, and these legal restrictions led to Alfred Nobel and his company's developing [[dynamite]] in 1867. This was made by mixing nitroglycerin with [[diatomaceous earth]] ("''Kieselgur''" in German) found in the Krümmel hills. Similar mixtures, such as "dualine" (1867), "lithofracteur" (1869), and "[[gelignite]]" (1875), were formed by mixing nitroglycerin with other inert absorbents, and many combinations were tried by other companies in attempts to get around Nobel's tightly held patents for dynamite.

Dynamite mixtures containing [[nitrocellulose]], which increases the viscosity of the mix, are commonly known as "gelatins".

Following the discovery that [[amyl nitrite]] helped alleviate chest pain, the physician [[William Murrell]] experimented with the use of nitroglycerin to alleviate angina pectoris and to reduce the [[blood pressure]]. He began treating his patients with small diluted doses of nitroglycerin in 1878, and this treatment was soon adopted into widespread use after Murrell published his results in the journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murrell |first=William |date=1879 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.d0000772988;view=1up;seq=78 |title=Nitroglycerin as a remedy for angina pectoris |journal=The Lancet |volume=1 |pages=80–81, 113–115, 151–152, 225–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sneader |first=Walter |title=Drug Discovery: A History |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |date=2005 |ISBN=0-471-89980-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months before his death in 1896, Alfred Nobel was prescribed nitroglycerin for this heart condition, writing to a friend: "Isn't it the irony of fate that I have been prescribed nitro-glycerin, to be taken internally! They call it Trinitrin, so as not to scare the chemist and the public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyonddiscovery.org/content/view.txt.asp?a=318|title=History of TNG|author=|date=|website=beyonddiscovery.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medical establishment also used the name "glyceryl trinitrate" for the same reason.

=== Wartime production rates ===
Large quantities of nitroglycerin were manufactured during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] for use as military propellants and in [[military engineering]] work. During World War I, [[HM Factory, Gretna]], the largest propellant factory in Britain, produced about 800 [[tonne]]s of cordite RDB per week. This amount required at least 336 tonnes of nitroglycerin per week (assuming no losses in production). The [[Royal Navy]] had its own factory at the [[Royal Navy Cordite Factory, Holton Heath]], in [[Dorset]], England. A large cordite factory was also built in Canada during World War I. The [[Canadian Industries Limited|Canadian Explosives Limited]] cordite factory at [[Nobel, Ontario]], was designed to produce {{convert|1500000|lb|t|abbr=on}} of cordite per month, requiring about 286 tonnes of nitroglycerin per month.

== Instability and desensitization ==
In its pure form, nitroglycerin is a [[contact explosive]], with physical shock causing it to explode, and it degrades over time to even more unstable forms. This makes nitroglycerin highly dangerous to transport or use. In its undiluted form, it is one of the world's most powerful explosives, comparable to the more recently developed [[RDX]] and [[PETN]].

Early in its history,  liquid nitroglycerin was found to be  "[[Phlegmatized|desensitized]]" by cooling it to about {{Convert|5|to|10|C|F|-1}}. At this temperature, nitroglycerin freezes, contracting upon [[solidification]]. Thawing it out can be extremely sensitizing, especially if impurities are present or the warming is too rapid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logwell.com/tales/second_nitro_death.html | title=Tales of Destruction – Thawing can be Hell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemically "desensitizing" nitroglycerin is possible to a point where it can be considered about as "safe" as modern [[high explosive]]s, such as by the addition of roughly 10 to 30% [[ethanol]], [[acetone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logwell.com/tales/red_glycerin.html | title=Tales of Destruction – Is Nitroglycerin in This?}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[dinitrotoluene]]. (The percentage varies with the desensitizing agent used.) Desensitization requires extra effort to reconstitute the "pure" product. Failing this,  desensitized nitroglycerin must be assumed to be substantially more difficult to detonate, possibly rendering it useless as an explosive for practical application.

A serious problem in the use of nitroglycerin results from its high freezing point of {{Convert|13|C|F}}. Solid nitroglycerin is much less sensitive to shock than the liquid, a common feature in explosives. In the past, nitroglycerin was often shipped in the frozen state, but this resulted in a high number of accidents during the thawing process just before its use. This disadvantage is overcome by using mixtures of nitroglycerin with other polynitrates. For example, a mixture of nitroglycerin and [[ethylene glycol dinitrate]] freezes at {{Convert|-29|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="fn_1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/nobel/micro/426_77.html | work=Encyclopaedia Britannica | title=Nitroglycerin | accessdate=2005-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Detonation ==
Nitroglycerin and any diluents can certainly [[deflagrate]] (burn). The explosive power of nitroglycerin derives from [[detonation]]: energy from the initial decomposition causes a strong pressure wave that detonates the surrounding fuel. This is a self-sustained [[shock wave]] that propagates through the explosive medium at 30 times the speed of sound as a near-instantaneous pressure-induced decomposition of the fuel into a white-hot gas. Detonation of nitroglycerin generates gases that would occupy more than 1,200 times the original volume at ordinary room temperature and pressure. The heat liberated raises the temperature to about {{convert|5000|C|F|-3}}.&lt;ref name="fn_1"/&gt; This is entirely different from deflagration, which depends solely upon available fuel regardless of pressure or shock. The decomposition results in much higher ratio of energy to gas moles released compared to other explosives, making it one of the hottest detonating [[high explosives]].

== Manufacturing ==
Nitroglycerin can be produced by acid-catalyzed nitration of [[glycerol]] (glycerin).

J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The industrial manufacturing process often reacts glycerol with a nearly 1:1 mixture of concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] and concentrated [[nitric acid]]. This can be produced by mixing [[white fuming nitric acid]]—a quite expensive pure nitric acid in which the oxides of nitrogen have been removed, as opposed to [[red fuming nitric acid]], which contains nitrogen oxides—and concentrated sulfuric acid. More often, this mixture is attained by the cheaper method of mixing fuming sulfuric acid, also known as [[oleum]]—sulfuric acid containing excess [[sulfur trioxide]]—and [[azeotropic]] nitric acid (consisting of about 70% nitric acid, with the rest being water).

The sulfuric acid produces protonated nitric acid species, which are attacked by glycerol's [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]] [[oxygen]] atoms. The [[nitro compound|nitro]] [[functional group|group]] is thus added as an ester C−O−NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water is produced. This is different from an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction in which [[nitronium ion]]s are the electrophile.

The addition of glycerol results in an [[chemical reaction|exothermic reaction]] (i.e., heat is produced), as usual for mixed-acid nitrations. If the mixture becomes too hot, it results in a runaway reaction, a state of accelerated nitration accompanied by the destructive [[oxidation]] of organic materials by the hot nitric acid and the release of poisonous [[nitrogen dioxide]] gas at high risk of an explosion. Thus, the glycerin mixture is added slowly to the reaction vessel containing the mixed acid (not acid to glycerin). The nitrator is cooled with cold water or some other coolant mixture and maintained throughout the glycerin addition at about {{convert|22|C|F}}, much below which the esterification occurs too slowly to be useful. The nitrator vessel, often constructed of [[iron]] or [[lead]] and generally stirred with [[compressed air]], has an emergency trap door at its base, which hangs over a large pool of very cold water and into which the whole reaction mixture (called the charge) can be dumped to prevent an explosion, a process referred to as drowning. If the temperature of the charge exceeds about {{convert|30|C|F}} (actual value varying by country) or brown fumes are seen in the nitrator's vent, then it is immediately drowned.

== Use as an explosive and a propellant ==
{{Main|Dynamite|Ballistite|Cordite|smokeless powder|Gelignite}}
[[File:Nobel patent.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alfred Nobel]]'s [[patent application]] from 1864]]
The main use of nitroglycerin, by tonnage, is in explosives such as dynamite and in propellants.

Nitroglycerin is an oily liquid that may explode when subjected to heat, shock, or flame.

[[Alfred Nobel]] developed the use of nitroglycerin as a blasting explosive by mixing nitroglycerin with inert [[absorbents]], particularly "''Kieselguhr''", or [[diatomaceous earth]]. He named this explosive [[dynamite]] and [[patented]] it in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/dstartinventions/a/Alfred_Nobel.htm|title=Alfred Nobel and the History of Dynamite|first=Mary|last=Bellis|work=About.com Money}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was supplied ready for use in the form of sticks, individually wrapped in greased waterproof paper. Dynamite and similar explosives were widely adopted for [[civil engineering]] tasks, such as in drilling [[highway]] and [[railroad]] [[tunnel]]s, for [[mining]], for clearing farmland of stumps, in [[quarrying]], and in [[demolition|demolition work]]. Likewise, [[military engineer]]s have used dynamite for construction and demolition work.

Nitroglycerin was also used as an ingredient in military propellants for use in [[firearms]].

Nitroglycerin has been used in conjunction with [[hydraulic fracturing]], a process used to recover [[crude oil|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] from [[shale]] formations. The technique involves displacing and detonating nitroglycerin in natural or hydraulically induced fracture systems, or displacing and detonating nitroglycerin in hydraulically induced fractures followed by wellbore shots using pelletized [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]].&lt;ref name="recovery"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=J. S.|last2=Johansen|first2=R. T.|date=1976 |title= Fracturing Oil Shale with Explosives for In Situ Recovery. |journal=Shale Oil, Tar Sand and Related Fuel Sources |format=PDF |pages=151|url=https://web.anl.gov/PCS/acsfuel/preprint%20archive/Files/19_2_LOS%20ANGELES_04-74__0060.pdf |accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitroglycerin has an advantage over some other high explosives that on detonation it produces practically no visible smoke. Therefore, it is useful as an ingredient in the formulation of various kinds of [[smokeless powder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/rzepa/mim/environmental/html/nitroglyc_text.htm|title=Nitroglycerin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its sensitivity has limited the usefulness of nitroglycerin as a military explosive, and less sensitive explosives such as [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]], [[RDX]], and [[HMX]] have largely replaced it in munitions. It remains important in military engineering, and [[combat engineer]]s still use dynamite.

Alfred Nobel then developed [[ballistite]], by combining nitroglycerin and [[guncotton]]. He patented it in 1887. Ballistite was adopted by a number of European governments, as a military propellant. Italy was the first to adopt it. The British government and the Commonwealth governments adopted [[cordite]] instead, which had been developed by Sir [[Frederick Abel]] and Sir [[James Dewar]] of the United Kingdom in 1889. The original Cordite Mk&amp;nbsp;I consisted of 58% nitroglycerin, 37% guncotton, and 5.0% [[petroleum jelly]]. Ballistite and cordite were both manufactured in the forms of "cords".

Smokeless powders were originally developed using nitrocellulose as the sole explosive ingredient. Therefore, they were known as single-base propellants. A range of smokeless powders that contains both nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin, known as double-base propellants, were also developed. Smokeless powders were originally supplied only for military use, but they were also soon developed for civilian use and were quickly adopted for sports. Some are known as sporting powders. Triple-base propellants contain nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin, and [[nitroguanidine]], but are reserved mainly for extremely high-caliber ammunition rounds such as those used in tank cannons and [[naval artillery]].

Blasting gelatin, also known as [[gelignite]], was invented by Nobel in 1875, using nitroglycerin, [[wood pulp]], and [[sodium nitrate|sodium]] or [[potassium nitrate]]. This was an early, low-cost, flexible explosive.

== Medical use ==
{{Main|Medical use of nitroglycerin}}
Nitroglycerin belongs to a group of drugs called nitrates, which includes many other nitrates like [[isosorbide dinitrate]] (Isordil) and [[isosorbide mononitrate]] (Imdur, Ismo, Monoket).&lt;ref name="Nitroglycerin Article"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/nitroglycerin/article.htm|title=nitroglycerin, Nitro-Bid: Drug Facts, Side Effects and Dosing|first=Omudhome|last=Ogbru|work=MedicineNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; These agents all exert their effect by being converted to [[nitric oxide]] in the body by mitochondrial [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] ([[ALDH2]]),&lt;ref name="Chen et al. 2005 12159–12164"/&gt; and nitric oxide is a potent natural vasodilator.

In [[medicine]], nitroglycerin is used for [[angina pectoris]], a painful symptom of [[coronary heart disease|ischemic heart disease]] caused by inadequate flow of blood and oxygen to the heart and as a potent antihypertensive agent. Nitroglycerin corrects the imbalance between the flow of oxygen and blood to the heart.&lt;ref name="Nitroglycerin Article"/&gt; At low doses, nitroglycerin dilates veins more than arteries, thereby reducing [[preload (cardiology)|preload]] (volume of blood in the heart after filling); this is thought to be its primary mechanism of action. By decreasing preload, the heart has less blood to pump, which decreases oxygen requirement since the heart does not have to work as hard. Additionally, having a smaller preload reduces the ventricular transmural pressure (pressure exerted on the walls of the heart), which decreases the compression of heart arteries to allow more blood to flow through the heart. At higher doses, it also dilates arteries, thereby reducing [[afterload]] (decreasing the pressure against which the heart must pump).&lt;ref name="Nitroglycerin Article"/&gt; Improved myocardial oxygen demand vs oxygen delivery ratio leads to the following therapeutic effects during episodes of angina pectoris: subsiding of chest pain, decrease of [[blood pressure]], increase of heart rate, and [[orthostatic hypotension]]. Patients experiencing angina when doing certain physical activities can often prevent symptoms by taking nitroglycerin 5 to 10 minutes before the activity. Overdoses may generate [[methemoglobinemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=3917597 | volume=55 | issue=1 | title=Association of methemoglobinemia and intravenous nitroglycerin administration | year=1985 | journal=American Journal of Cardiology | pages=181–183 | last1=Kaplan | first1=K.

Nitroglycerin is available in tablets, ointment, solution for [[intravenous]] use, [[transdermal patch]]es, or sprays administered [[sublingual]]ly. Some forms of nitroglycerin last much longer in the body than others. Continuous exposure to nitrates has been shown to cause the body to stop responding normally to this medicine. Experts recommend that the patches be removed at night, allowing the body a few hours to restore its responsiveness to nitrates. Shorter-acting preparations of nitroglycerin can be used several times a day with less risk of developing tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/src/detail?vid=17&amp;hid=7&amp;sid=7e55c0c3-4b92-4b24-ac2d-b2091791a502%40sessionmgr14&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9c3JjLWxpdmU%3d#db=hxh&amp;AN=9703191987|title=Nitroglycerin for angina, February 1997, Vol. 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitroglycerin was first used by [[William Murrell]] to treat angina attacks in 1878, with the discovery published that same year.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1798737| year = 1971| author1 = Smith| first1 = E.| title = William Murrell, physician and practical therapist| journal = British Medical Journal| volume = 3| issue = 5775| pages = 632–633| last2 = Hart| first2 = F. D.| pmid = 4998847| doi=10.1136/bmj.3.5775.632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industrial exposure ==
Infrequent exposure to high doses of nitroglycerin can cause severe [[headache]]s known as "NG head" or "bang head". These headaches can be severe enough to incapacitate some people; however, humans develop a [[tachyphylaxis|tolerance]] to and dependence on nitroglycerin after long-term exposure. Withdrawal can (rarely) be fatal;&lt;ref name="CDT"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amdur |first1=Mary O. |last2=Doull |first2=John |title=Casarett and Doull's Toxicology |edition=4th |publisher=Elsevier |date=1991 |isbn=0071052399}}&lt;/ref&gt; withdrawal symptoms include chest pain and heart problems and if unacceptable may be treated with re-exposure to nitroglycerin or other suitable organic nitrates.&lt;ref name="Jr.Krieger2001"&gt;{{cite book|first1=John B., Jr. |last1=Sullivan |first2=Gary R. |last2=Krieger|title=Clinical Environmental Health and Toxic Exposures: Latex|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PyUSgdZUGr4C&amp;pg=PA264|accessdate=23 April 2013|year=2001|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-683-08027-8|pages=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For workers in nitroglycerin (NTG) manufacturing facilities, the effects of withdrawal sometimes include "Sunday heart attacks" in those experiencing regular nitroglycerin exposure in the workplace, leading to the development of tolerance for the venodilating effects. Over the weekend, the workers lose the tolerance, and when they are re-exposed on Monday, the drastic [[vasodilation]] produces a [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]], dizziness, and a headache, this is referred to as "Monday disease."&lt;ref name="Short history"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marsh |first1=N. |last2=Marsh |first2=A. |title=A short history of nitroglycerine and nitric oxide in pharmacology and physiology |journal=Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=313–319 |year=2000 |pmid=10779131 |doi= 10.1046/j.1440-1681.2000.03240.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0305-1870&amp;date=2000&amp;volume=27&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=313 |accessdate=2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toxicology"&gt;{{cite book|author=Assembly of Life Sciences (U.S.) Advisory Center on Toxicology|title=Toxicological Reports|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEQrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA115|accessdate=23 April 2013|publisher=National Academies|pages=115|id=NAP:11288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People can be exposed to nitroglycerin in the workplace by breathing it in, skin absorption, swallowing it, or eye contact. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]  has set the legal limit ([[permissible exposure limit]]) for nitroglycerin exposure in the workplace as 0.2&amp;nbsp;ppm (2&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]  has set a [[recommended exposure limit]]  of 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 75&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, nitroglycerin is [[IDLH|immediately dangerous to life and health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher= CDC |work=NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards |title=Nitroglycerine|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0456.html|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Orangi Pilot Project''' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|اورنگی پائلٹ پراجیکٹ}}}}; abbreviated '''OPP''') collectively designates three [[Pakistan]]i [[Non-governmental organisation]]s working together, having emerged from a [[Social Innovation|socially innovative]] project carried out in 1980s in the squatter areas of [[Orangi Town]], [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]]. It was initiated by [[Akhtar Hameed Khan]], and involved the local residents solving their own [[sanitation]] problems. Innovative methods were used to provide adequate low cost [[sanitation]], [[health]], [[House|housing]] and [[microfinance]] facilities.

Currently OPP designates three organisations, borne out of the original OPP in 1989 : OPP-RTI (Research and Training Institute), OPP-OCT (Orangi Charitable Trust, involved in [[microfinance]]) and OPP-KHASDA (Karachi Health and Social Development Association, involved in [[health]] activities). A fourth organisation, OPP-RDT (Rural Development Trust) was merged with OPP-RTI in 2012.

The project also comprised a number of programs, including a people's financed and managed Low-Cost [[Sanitation]] Program; a Housing Program; a [[List of basic health topics|Basic Health]] and [[Family Planning]] Program; a Program of [[Microcredit|Supervised Credit]] for Small Family Enterprise Units; an [[education]] Program; and a [[Rural development]] Program in the nearby villages.&lt;ref&gt;1996, Orangi Pilot Project: Reflection and Reminiscences. The Oxford University Press: Karachi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the project encompasses much more than the neighbourhood level problems. The research and development programmes under the [[institution]]s developed by the project now covers wider issues related to the areas all over Karachi.

Its director until 2013 was [[Perween Rahman]], who was murdered on 13 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21783304|title=Pakistan mourns murdered aid worker Parveen Rehman|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The success ==
Orangi was a [[squatter]] community, and did not qualify for government aid due to their "unofficial" status.&lt;ref&gt;1999, Arif Hasan, Akhtar Hameed Khan and the Orangi Pilot Project. City Press: Karachi&lt;/ref&gt; With endogenous research, the community was able to make an affordable sanitation system for the treatment of sewage, which helped to reduce the spread of disease. The system was created and paid for by the local community, who would not have had access to a sewer system otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;1997, Akhter Hameed Khan, The sanitation gap: Development's deadly menace. The Progress of Nations. [[UNICEF]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme proved so successful that it was adopted by the communities across [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;2000, In commemoration of The Life and Times of Akhter Hameed Khan: Talks of Akhter Hameed Khan at the National Rural Support Programme, Islamabad, NRSP&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of the initial phase, the program was expanded into four autonomous groups.&lt;ref&gt;1997, George H. Axinn, Agriculture and Human Values, Vol. 14, No. 2, (June). ISSN 0889-048X&lt;/ref&gt;
# The ''Orangi Pilot Project Society'', to control funding for the other three groups.

He had previously organised farmers' [[cooperatives]] and rural training centres and had served as an adviser to various development projects in [[Pakistan]].

Comparing the OPP with his earlier [[Comilla Model|Comilla project]], Akhtar Hameed Khan commented: 
:''"The Orangi Pilot Project was very different from the Comilla Academy. OPP was a private body, dependent for its small fixed budget on another NGO. The vast resources and support of the government, Harvard advisers, MSU, and Ford Foundation was missing. OPP possessed no authority, no sanctions. It may observe and investigate but it could only advise, not enforce."''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/divisions/lgrd-division/media/ncrd/intro.html Introduction about Late Dr Akhtar Hameed Khan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917182312/http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/divisions/lgrd-division/media/ncrd/intro.html |date=17 September 2009 }} at [[Government of Pakistan]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

However, both projects followed the same research and extension methods.

== Orangi Pilot Project – Orangi Charitable Trust (OPP – OCT)==

"OPP-OCT discovered that this growing settlement of Orangi was full of the enterprising spirit. The most impressive demonstration of the spirit of enterprises is the creation of employment everywhere in the lanes; inside the homes there are around twenty thousand family units, shops workshops, peddlers and vendors. In response to the dual challenge of inflation and recession, the residents have invented working family, modifying homes into workshops, promoting the women from mere dependents to economic partners and wage earners, abandoning the dominant patriarchal pattern with surprising speed.

OPP’s research revealed two significant factors; first, there was unlimited demand for products and services of these family units. Second, the family units were extremely competitive (on account of very low over heads and very cheap and docile labour). The working family units of Orangi were completely integrated with the main Karachi markets. In fact many units are supplying goods to famous firms, who just put their labels and make big profits. What is required is to support their initiatives.

Research further revealed that the production and employment in urban as well as rural areas could easily be increased provided the credit is accessible, as there was no shortage of market demand or productive labour. But they would not get credit at reasonable rate, because banks were inaccessible to them. The lack of bank credit forced them to buy raw materials at exorbitant prices while they had to sell their products at depressed prices and forego expansion.

On the basis of the research findings, Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) decided to arrange access to credit to these micro enterprises. For this Orangi Pilot Project – Orangi Charitable Trust (OPP – OCT) was established in 1989 as an independent and autonomous institution in Orangi, a low income settlement of over one million people. The main objective is to support people effort in their economic development by providing credit in urban and rural areas."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oppoct-microcredit.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11841">'''Oriental Powder Company''' was a [[gunpowder]] manufacturer with mills located on the [[Presumpscot River]] in [[Gorham, Maine|Gorham]] and [[Windham, Maine]].  The company was one of the four largest suppliers to [[Union (ACW)|Union]] forces through the [[American Civil War]].

==History==
The Presumpscot River dropped 16 feet at Gambo Falls where the river formed the border between the towns of Windham and Gorham.  [[Sebago Lake]] formed a large natural reservoir upstream of Gambo giving the falls an unusually reliable water supply with comparatively minor flow peaking from storm runoff.&lt;ref name="wells"&gt;Wells, Walter ''The water-power of Maine'' (1869) Sprague, Owen &amp; Nash, Augusta&lt;/ref&gt;  Early European settlers built a [[sawmill]] powered by the falls.  In 1824 the sawmill was converted to gunpowder manufacture by Edmund Fowler and Lester Laflin. Their Gorham Powder Company became known among the local population as the Gambo powder mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whitten |first=Maurice M. |authorlink = |title =The Gunpowder Mills of Windham-Gorham, Maine |publisher =Windham Historical Society |volume = |edition = |date =2012 |location =[[Windham, Maine]] |page =8&amp;9 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lester Laflin was a grandson of [[American Revolutionary War]] gunpowder manufacturer Matthew Laflin.  The Laflin family manufactured gunpowder in [[Massachusetts]] for several generations.  When Lester came east to Maine, his first cousins traveled west to build gunpowder mills in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Matthew Laflin|Chicago]].&lt;ref name="dupont"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.dupont.com/Heritage/en_US/related_topics/laflin_rand_powder_company.html|title=Laflin &amp; Rand Powder Company|publisher=DuPont|accessdate=2010-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lester, his partner, and their mill foreman drowned on Sebago Lake on 22 June 1827.&lt;ref name="dole"&gt;Dole, Samuel Thomas ''Windham in the Past'' (1916)&lt;/ref&gt;
Following an explosion killing seven employees on 19 July 1828,&lt;ref name="news"&gt;''The Newsletter of Presumpscot Regional Land Trust'' Winter 2009-2010&lt;/ref&gt; the Gambo Falls mill was enlarged by [[Wamesit Canal-Whipple Mill Industrial Complex#Gunpowder mill|Oliver Whipple]] concurrently with construction of locks for the [[Cumberland and Oxford Canal]]. Whipple had been manufacturing gunpowder in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]] since 1818. The new canal provided reliable transportation from [[Portland, Maine|Portland harbor]] for [[sulfur]] from [[Sicily]] and [[potassium nitrate|saltpeter]] from [[India]] and from Sebago Lake for [[charcoal]] and lumber from forests to the north.  Whipple's Gambo mill used the lumber to manufacture [[keg]]s holding as much as 25 pounds of powder.  Kegs of gunpowder were shipped to Portland in canal boats when possible, but moved in [[horse]]-drawn [[sleigh]]s when the canal was frozen.&lt;ref name="dole"/&gt;  Canal boats carried about 25 tons, and sometimes sailed all the way to [[Boston]] when weather was favorable.&lt;ref name="news"/&gt;

After plant explosions killed one employee each in 1835, 1847, 1849, 1850, and 1851, a major explosion on 12 October 1855 killed seven employees,&lt;ref name="news"/&gt; including Whipple's brother and son, injured five more and destroyed a canal boat and parts of the mill.&lt;ref name="dole"/&gt;  Manufacture of gunpowder in response to orders avoided the hazard of storing powder inventories until orders were received, but required water power on demand.  The canal lock system controlled outflow from Sebago Lake; and, as a shipper interested in the well-being of its customer, canal management was receptive to regulating water releases to meet needs of the powder mill.

==Oriental Powder Company organized==
Gilbert Grafton Newhall of Salem, Massachusetts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Swasey |first=Charles |authorlink = |title =Historical Collections of the Essex Institute |publisher =Essex Institute |volume =VI |edition = |date =1864 |location =Salem, Massachusetts |page =127 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; purchased the property in early 1855 to manufacture powder for [[Crimean War]] belligerents, and organized Oriental Powder Company to repair the damage and construct new facilities.  A charcoal house, saltpeter refinery, wheel mills, press mills, kernelling mills, glazing mills, and storehouses were dispersed along both banks of the river and canal for a mile upstream of Gambo to minimize damage during infrequent explosions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windham.k12.me.us/teachers/lmorse/windham/photo/page10.html|title=The Oriental Powder Mills|publisher=Windham Photo Album|accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charcoal was manufactured from dried, debarked [[alder]] packed into [[cast iron]] [[retort]]s. Charcoal was made from [[willow]], [[Populus grandidentata|poplar]] or [[maple]] when alder was unavailable. Crude saltpeter was dissolved in hot water in kettles holding as much as {{convert|600|gal|liter}}. Impurities were skimmed from the surface or settled to the bottom so a hot, saturated solution could be decanted for crystallization. Moist saltpeter crystals were mixed with appropriate amounts of sulfur and charcoal by heavy rotating wheels to form a cake which was then cut unto smaller pieces in [[bronze]]- or [[zinc]]-toothed kernelling mills. The kernels were [[sieve]]d into desired sizes and dried prior to being tumbled with [[graphite]] which reduced tendency for the finished grains to stick together during storage. Intermediate products were transported between the dispersed production and storage facilities in wooden [[wheelbarrow]]s constructed with no iron parts and pushed over plank walkways by workmen going barefoot in the summer or wearing shoes without iron nails during colder weather.&lt;ref name=mmw&gt;{{cite book |last=Whitten |first=Maurice M. |authorlink = |title =The Gunpowder Mills of Windham-Gorham, Maine |publisher =Windham Historical Society |volume = |edition = |date =2012 |location =[[Windham, Maine]] |pages =15-30 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newhall gave his name to a small [[company town]] of employee residences built near Gambo Falls.&lt;ref name="dole"/&gt;  Company offices were in [[Portland, Maine]] to avoid business disruption by the periodic explosions at the manufacturing facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, Philip B. ''Complete Guide to Handloading'' 3rd Edition (1953) Funk &amp; Wagnalls p.139&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1860, Oriental was one of four companies making 69% of United States gunpowder sales.  The larger [[DuPont]] and [[Hazard Powder Company]] mills each provided approximately one-third of the Union gunpowder supply for the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Mark R. ''The business of civil war: military mobilization and the state, 1861-1865'' (2006) JHU Press p.118&lt;/ref&gt;  The fourth major supplier was Lester Laflin's cousins' mill which later evolved into the early [[smokeless powder]] manufacturer [[Laflin &amp; Rand Powder Company|Laflin &amp; Rand]].&lt;ref name="dupont"/&gt;  The DuPont mill was uncomfortably close to the battle line and considered potentially vulnerable to sabotage from southern sympathizers in the slave state of [[Delaware]].&lt;ref name="hagley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hagley.org/library/exhibits/civilwartech/index.php?page=Modules&amp;module=Gunpowder&amp;chapter=4&amp;frame=2|title=Gunpowder in the American Civil War|publisher=Hagley Library|accessdate=2010-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government purchased as much powder as Oriental Powder Company could produce through the war years. Wartime production included large cast hexagonal powder grains for [[Rodman gun]]s; and an {{convert|8|in|cm|sing=on}} [[Columbiad]] was installed at Gambo to test this specialized powder. Production increased to 1250 tons per year&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt; as accidental explosions killed one employee on 8 July 1861, three on 7 July 1862, and another on 14 November 1863.&lt;ref name="news"/&gt;  Demand for gunpowder declined when the civil war ended, but picked up briefly during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]&lt;ref&gt;Nutt, Charles ''History of Worcester and its people'' (1919) Lewis Historical Publishing p.341&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War]].&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt; Oriental Powder Company was ranked 4th (after DuPont, Laflin &amp; Rand, and Hazard) among the six companies of the United States Gunpowder Trade Association popularly known as the [[Trust (monopoly)|powder trust]].&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, John K. ''The DuPont Dynasty'' (2005) Kessinger Publishing pp.122&amp;123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
Canal boats were unable to compete with rail service and the canal was unused after the [[Portland and Ogdensburg Railway]] reached Gambo Falls (by then called Newhall) in 1871.&lt;ref name="news"/&gt;  Oriental Powder Company employees assumed control of the former canal dam at Sebago Lake when the canal locks ceased operations; but water users in [[Westbrook, Maine]], were unsatisfied with timing of water releases.  Court action was initiated in January 1877, following a drought.  Legal maneuvering continued for several months between Oriental Powder Company and Westbrook water users while water releases were controlled by whichever side mustered a larger number of employees at the dam.  Legislation enacted in February 1878 effectively passed control of water releases from Sebago Lake to water users in Westbrook.&lt;ref name="wheeler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friendsofsebago.org/basindamwar.html|title=The Basin Dam War|publisher=Friends of Sebago Lake|accessdate=2010-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As smaller Maine gunpowder mills went out of business following the civil war, Oriental Powder Company acquired the assets of the North [[Buckfield, Maine|Buckfield]] Powder Mill in 1880, the [[Warren, Maine|Warren]] Powder Mill in 1887, and the [[Camden, Maine|Camden]] Powder Mill in 1892. Machinery was salvaged from these mills, and a subsidiary Oriental Powder Company of Pennsylvania began manufacturing [[rock blasting]] powder at [[Fairchance, Pennsylvania]] in 1902.&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt; As [[telegraph]] became available for sales communications, the powder company reduced the risk to manufacturing facilities by building magazines for powder inventories near distant rail distribution centers like [[Chicago]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.gendisasters.com/illinois/442/chicago,-il-lightning-powder-explosion,-aug-1886|title=Chicago, IL Lightning and Powder Explosion, Aug 1886|publisher=GenDisasters|accessdate=2010-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Salt Lake City]].&lt;ref&gt;''San Francisco Examiner'' 6 April 1876 Calamity in Salt Lake City&lt;/ref&gt;

Local supplies of charcoal and keg staves became more expensive as forest resources were exhausted.  The rock blasting powder market for [[mining]] and [[railroad]] construction fluctuated with financial panics.  The Newhall mill ceased operations on 1 June 1893 as smokeless powder and [[dynamite]] became preferred for traditional uses of gunpowder.  Eastern Dynamite Company was formed in 1895 and began manufacturing dynamite at Newhall.&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt;  Four employees died in three fatal explosions through the final decade of explosives manufacture.  March 19, 1904, was the last of 32 recorded blasts claiming 46 lives along the river.&lt;ref name="news"/&gt; Mill operations after the 1904 explosion were limited to manufacturing wood flour shipped elsewhere for mixing with [[nitroglycerine]] to form dynamite. Production of wood flour continued into the 1950s after ownership passed to the Atlas Powder Company in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dole |first=Frederick Howard |authorlink = |title =Sketches of the History of Windham, Maine 1734-1935 |publisher =Henry S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18126">A '''pitot-static system''' is a [[system]] of pressure-sensitive instruments that is most often used in aviation to determine an aircraft's [[airspeed]], [[Mach number]], [[altitude]], and [[vertical speed indicator|altitude trend]].  A pitot-static system generally consists of a [[pitot tube]], a static port, and the pitot-static instruments.&lt;ref name="jepp"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Willits, Pat|others=Abbot, Mike Kailey, Liz|title=Guided Flight Discovery - Private Pilot|origyear=1997|publisher=Jeppesen Sanderson|year=2004|isbn= 0-88487-333-1|pages=2–48–2–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other instruments that might be connected are [[air data computer]]s, [[flight data recorder]]s, [[encoder|altitude encoder]]s, [[cabin pressurization]] controllers, and various airspeed switches.  Errors in pitot-static system readings can be extremely dangerous as the information obtained from the pitot static system, such as altitude, is potentially safety-critical.  Several commercial airline disasters have been traced to a failure of the pitot-static system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2004/05/01/safety-maintenance-snafu-with-static-ports|title=Safety: Maintenance Snafu with Static Ports|date=1 May 2004|accessdate=2017-06-26|last=Evans|first=David|publisher=[[Avionics Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pitot-static pressure ==
[[File:Pitot tube types.svg|right|thumb|180px|Examples of [[pitot tube]], static tube, and pitot-static tube.]]
[[File:StaticPort.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Static ports fitted to an [[Airbus A330]] passenger airliner.]]
The pitot-static system of instruments uses the principle of [[pressure gradient|air pressure gradient]]. It works by measuring pressures or pressure differences and using these values to assess the speed and altitude.&lt;ref name="jepp"/&gt; These pressures can be measured either from the static port (static pressure) or the pitot tube (pitot pressure).  The static pressure is used in all measurements, while the pitot pressure is used only to determine airspeed.

=== Pitot pressure ===
The pitot pressure is obtained from the [[pitot tube]].  The pitot pressure is a measure of [[Ram pressure|ram air pressure]] (the air pressure created by vehicle motion or the air ramming into the tube), which, under ideal conditions, is equal to [[stagnation pressure]], also called total pressure.  The pitot tube is most often located on the wing or front section of an aircraft, facing forward, where its opening is exposed to the [[relative wind]].&lt;ref name="jepp"/&gt;  By situating the pitot tube in such a location, the ram air pressure is more accurately measured since it will be less distorted by the aircraft's structure.  When airspeed increases, the ram air pressure is increased, which can be translated by the [[airspeed indicator]].&lt;ref name="jepp"/&gt;

=== Static pressure ===
The static pressure is obtained through a static port.  The static port is most often a flush-mounted hole on the [[fuselage]] of an aircraft, and is located where it can access the air flow in a relatively undisturbed area.&lt;ref name="jepp"/&gt;  Some aircraft may have a single static port, while others may have more than one.  In situations where an aircraft has more than one static port, there is usually one located on each side of the fuselage.  With this positioning, an average pressure can be taken, which allows for more accurate readings in specific flight situations.&lt;ref name="jepp"/&gt;  An alternative static port may be located inside the cabin of the aircraft as a backup for when the external static port(s) are blocked.  A pitot-static tube effectively integrates the static ports into the pitot probe.  It incorporates a second coaxial tube (or tubes) with pressure sampling holes on the sides of the probe, outside the direct airflow, to measure the static pressure. When the aircraft climbs, static pressure will decrease.

=== Multiple pressure ===
Some pitot-static systems incorporate single probes that contain multiple pressure-transmitting ports that allow for the sensing of air pressure, angle of attack, and angle of sideslip data.  Depending on the design, such air data probes may be referred to as 5-hole or 7-hole air data probes.  Differential pressure sensing techniques can be used to produce angle of attack and angle of sideslip indications.

[[File:ASI-operation-FAA.png|right|thumb|Airspeed indicator diagram showing pressure sources from both the pitot tube and static port]]
The pitot-static system obtains pressures for interpretation by the pitot-static instruments.  While the explanations below explain traditional, mechanical instruments, many modern aircraft use an [[air data computer]] (ADC) to calculate airspeed, rate of climb, altitude and [[Mach number]]. In some aircraft, two ADCs receive total and static pressure from independent pitot tubes and static ports, and the aircraft's [[Aircraft flight control system|flight data computer]] compares the information from both computers and checks one against the other. There are also "standby instruments", which are back-up pneumatic instruments employed in the case of problems with the primary instruments.

=== Airspeed indicator ===
{{main article|Airspeed indicator}}
The airspeed indicator is connected to both the pitot and static pressure sources.  The difference between the pitot pressure and the static pressure is called dynamic pressure. The greater the dynamic pressure, the higher the airspeed reported. A traditional mechanical airspeed indicator contains a [[Diaphragm (mechanical device)|pressure diaphragm]] that is connected to the pitot tube.  The case around the diaphragm is [[airtight]] and is vented to the static port.  The higher the speed, the higher the ram pressure, the more pressure exerted on the diaphragm, and the larger the needle movement through the mechanical linkage.&lt;ref name="allstar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allstar.fiu.edu/aero/PSI.htm|title=Pitot-Static Instruments - Level 3 - Pitot-Static Instruments|accessdate=2007-01-07|publisher=allstar.fiu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Faa altimeter.JPG|right|thumb|Diagram of an altimeter]]

=== Altimeter ===
{{main article|Altimeter}}
The pressure altimeter, also known as the barometric altimeter, is used to determine changes in air pressure that occur as the aircraft's altitude changes.&lt;ref name="allstar"/&gt;  Pressure altimeters must be calibrated prior to flight to register the pressure as an altitude above sea level.  The instrument case of the altimeter is airtight and has a vent to the static port.  Inside the instrument, there is a sealed [[Barometer|aneroid barometer]].  As pressure in the case decreases, the internal barometer expands, which is mechanically translated into a determination of altitude.  The reverse is true when descending from higher to lower altitudes.&lt;ref name="allstar"/&gt;

===Machmeter===
{{main article|Machmeter}}
Aircraft designed to operate at transonic or supersonic speeds will incorporate a machmeter.  The machmeter is used to show the ratio of true airspeed in relation to the [[speed of sound]].  Most supersonic aircraft are limited as to the maximum [[Mach number]] they can fly, which is known as the "Mach limit". The Mach number is displayed on a machmeter as a [[decimal fraction]].&lt;ref name="allstar"/&gt;

[[File:Faa vertical air speed.JPG|right|thumb|A vertical speed indicator]]

=== Vertical speed indicator ===
{{main article|Variometer}}
The [[variometer]], also known as the vertical speed indicator (VSI) or the vertical velocity indicator (VVI), is the pitot-static instrument used to determine whether or not an aircraft is flying in level flight.&lt;ref name="faa6-9"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.faa.gov/library/manuals/aviation/pilot_handbook/media/faa-h-8083-25-2of4.pdf |title=Pilot Handbook - Chapters 6 through 9|format=[[PDF]]|publisher=[[FAA]] |accessdate=2007-01-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070106081702/http://www.faa.gov/library/manuals/aviation/pilot_handbook/media/faa-h-8083-25-2of4.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The vertical speed specifically shows the rate of climb or the rate of descent, which is measured in feet per minute or meters per second.&lt;ref name="faa6-9"/&gt;  The vertical speed is measured through a mechanical linkage to a diaphragm located within the instrument.  The area surrounding the diaphragm is vented to the static port through a calibrated leak (which also may be known as a "restricted diffuser").&lt;ref name="allstar"/&gt;  When the aircraft begins to increase altitude, the diaphragm will begin to contract at a rate faster than that of the calibrated leak, causing the needle to show a positive vertical speed.  The reverse of this situation is true when an aircraft is descending.&lt;ref name="allstar"/&gt;  The calibrated leak varies from model to model, but the average time for the diaphragm to equalize pressure is between 6 and 9 seconds.&lt;ref name="allstar"/&gt;

== Pitot-static errors ==
There are several situations that can affect the accuracy of the pitot-static instruments.  Some of these involve failures of the pitot-static system itself—which may be classified as "system malfunctions"—while others are the result of faulty instrument placement or other environmental factors—which may be classified as "inherent errors".&lt;ref name="allstar-pssi"/&gt;

=== System malfunctions ===

==== Blocked pitot tube ====
A blocked pitot tube is a pitot-static problem that will only affect airspeed indicators.&lt;ref name="allstar-pssi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allstar.fiu.edu/aero/PSSI.htm|title=Flight Instruments - Level 3 - Pitot-Static System and Instruments|accessdate=2007-01-07|publisher=allstar.fiu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A blocked pitot tube will cause the airspeed indicator to register an increase in airspeed when the aircraft climbs, even though actual airspeed is constant. (As long as the drain hole is also blocked, as the air pressure would otherwise leak out to the atmosphere.)  This is caused by the pressure in the pitot system remaining constant when the atmospheric pressure (and [[Static pressure#Static pressure in design and operation of aircraft|static pressure]]) are decreasing.  In reverse, the airspeed indicator will show a decrease in airspeed when the aircraft descends.  The pitot tube is susceptible to becoming clogged by ice, water, insects or some other obstruction.&lt;ref name="allstar-pssi"/&gt;  For this reason, aviation regulatory agencies such as the U.S. [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) recommend that the pitot tube be checked for obstructions prior to any flight.&lt;ref name="faa6-9"/&gt;  To prevent icing, many pitot tubes are equipped with a heating element.  A heated pitot tube is required in all aircraft [[Type certificate|certificated]] for [[Instrument flight rules|instrument flight]] except aircraft certificated as Experimental Amateur-Built.&lt;ref name="allstar-pssi"/&gt;

==== Blocked static port ====
A blocked static port is a more serious situation because it affects all pitot-static instruments.&lt;ref name="allstar-pssi"/&gt; One of the most common causes of a blocked static port is airframe icing.  A blocked static port will cause the altimeter to freeze at a constant value, the altitude at which the static port became blocked.  The vertical speed indicator will read zero and will not change at all, even if vertical speed increases or decreases.  The airspeed indicator will reverse the error that occurs with a clogged pitot tube and cause the airspeed to be read less than it actually is as the aircraft climbs.  When the aircraft is descending, the airspeed will be over-reported.  In most aircraft with unpressurized cabins, an alternative static source is available and can be selected from within the [[cockpit]].&lt;ref name="allstar-pssi"/&gt;

=== Inherent errors ===
Inherent errors may fall into several categories, each affecting different instruments.  ''Density errors'' affect instruments metering airspeed and altitude.  This type of error is caused by variations of pressure and temperature in the atmosphere.  A ''compressibility error'' can arise because the impact pressure will cause the air to compress in the pitot tube. At standard sea level pressure altitude the calibration equation (see [[calibrated airspeed]]) correctly accounts for the compression so there is no compressibility error at sea level. At higher altitudes the compression is not correctly accounted for and will cause the instrument to read greater than [[equivalent airspeed]]. A correction may be obtained from a chart. Compressibility error becomes significant at altitudes above {{convert|10000|ft|m}} and at airspeeds greater than {{convert|200|kn|km/h}}. ''[[Hysteresis]]'' is an error that is caused by mechanical properties of the aneroid capsules located within the instruments.  These capsules, used to determine pressure differences, have physical properties that resist change by retaining a given shape, even though the external forces may have changed. ''Reversal errors'' are caused by a false static pressure reading.  This false reading may be caused by abnormally large changes in an aircraft's pitch.  A large change in pitch will cause a momentary showing of movement in the opposite direction.  Reversal errors primarily affect altimeters and vertical speed indicators.&lt;ref name="allstar-pssi"/&gt;

==== Position errors ====
Another class of inherent errors is that of [[position error]].  A position error is produced by the aircraft's static pressure being different from the air pressure remote from the aircraft.  This error is caused by the air flowing past the static port at a speed different from the aircraft's [[true airspeed]].  Position errors may provide positive or negative errors, depending on one of several factors.  These factors include airspeed, [[angle of attack]], aircraft weight, acceleration, aircraft configuration, and in the case of helicopters, [[Downwash|rotor downwash]].&lt;ref name="allstar-pssi"/&gt;  There are two categories of position errors, which are "fixed errors" and "variable errors".  Fixed errors are defined as errors which are specific to a particular model of aircraft.  Variable errors are caused by external factors such as deformed panels obstructing the flow of air, or particular situations which may overstress the aircraft.&lt;ref name="allstar-pssi"/&gt;

==== Lag errors ====
Lag errors are caused by the fact that any changes in the static or dynamic pressure outside the aircraft require a finite amount of time to make their way down the tubing and affect the gauges. This type of error depends on the length and diameter of the tubing as well as the volume inside the gauges.&lt;ref&gt;Gracey, William. 1981. Measurement of Aircraft Speed and Altitude. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|0-471-08511-1}}. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Lag error is only significant around the time when the airspeed or altitude are changing. It is not a concern for steady level flight.

== Pitot-static related disasters ==
*1 December 1974 – [[Northwest Airlines Flight 6231]], a [[Boeing 727]], crashed northwest of [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] during climb en route to [[Buffalo Niagara International Airport]] because of blockage of the [[pitot tube]]s by [[atmospheric icing]].
* 6 February 1996 – [[Birgenair Flight 301]] crashed into the sea shortly after takeoff due to incorrect readings from the airspeed indicator. The suspected cause is a blocked pitot tube (this was never confirmed, as the airplane wreck was not recovered).&lt;ref name="asn-bair301"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19960206-0|title=ASN Aircraft accident description Boeing 757-225 TC-GEN — Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic|accessdate=2007-01-07|publisher=aviation-safety.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Remote Sensing Systems''' ('''RSS''') is a private research company founded in 1974 by [[Frank Wentz]]. It processes microwave data from a variety of [[NASA]] satellites. Most of their research is supported by the [[Earth Science Enterprise]] program. The company is based in [[Santa Rosa, California]].

They are a widely cited source of data, on the [[satellite temperature record]]. Their data is one source of evidence for [[global warming]]. Research by [[Carl Mears]], Matthias Schabel, and Wentz, all of RSS, highlighted errors in the early satellite temperature records compiled by [[John Christy]] and [[Roy Spencer (scientist)|Roy Spencer]] at [[University of Alabama in Huntsville|UAH]]. The [[University of Alabama in Huntsville|UAH]] data had previously showed no significant temperature trend, bringing the derived satellite data into closer agreement with surface temperature trends, radiosonde data and computer models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/18/science/earth/18CLIM.html |title=New View of Data Supports Human Link to Global Warming |author=Andrew Revkin |date=November 18, 2003 |work=New York Times |accessdate=November 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Alabama in Huntsville|UAH]] data is now closer to the RSS data but differences remain, for example the Lower Troposphere global average trend since 1979, RSS currently have +0.133K/decade while UAH have 0.140K/decade, while the mid troposphere difference is even more marked at 0.079K/decade and 0.052K/decade respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssmi.com/msu/msu_data_description.html|title=RSS / MSU and AMSU Data / Description|accessdate=26 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123040542/http://www.ssmi.com/msu/msu_data_description.html|archivedate=23 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/data/msu/t2lt/tltglhmam_5.4|title=MONTHLY MEANS OF LOWER TROPOSPHERE LT5.4|work=UAH|accessdate=26 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717025455/http://vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/data/msu/t2lt/tltglhmam_5.4|archivedate=17 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in a recent online YouTube video, Dr. Carl Mears, a senior scientist with the team behind the satellite data, explained how he believes his data set needed correction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.inverse.com/article/12349-ted-cruz-gets-his-comeuppance-for-cherry-picked-climate-change-data Ronson, J.

The free-standing posts in the interior of the house and the posts in the gable or lateral walls were originally called ''Firstsäule'' (ridge columns). On a purlin roof the ridge posts carry the ridge purlin. On the latter are hung the sloping rafters to which the roof is fixed.

'''Shale oil extraction''' is an [[industrial process]] for [[unconventional oil]] production.  This process converts [[kerogen]] in [[oil shale]] into [[shale oil]] by [[pyrolysis]], [[hydrogenation]], or [[thermal dissolution]].  The resultant shale oil is used as [[fuel oil]] or [[Upgrader|upgraded]] to meet [[oil refinery|refinery]] feedstock specifications by adding [[hydrogen]] and removing [[sulfur]] and [[nitrogen]] impurities.

Shale oil extraction is usually performed above ground (''ex situ'' processing) by mining the oil shale and then treating it in [[chemical plant|processing facilities]]. Other modern technologies perform the processing underground (on-site or ''[[In situ#Petroleum production|in situ]]'' processing) by applying heat and extracting the oil via [[oil well]]s.

The earliest description of the process dates to the 10th century. In 1684, Great Britain granted the first formal extraction process patent. Extraction industries and innovations became widespread during the 19th century. The industry shrank in the mid-20th century following the discovery of large [[Oil reserves|reserves of conventional oil]], but  high [[Price of petroleum|petroleum prices]] at the beginning of the 21st century have led to renewed interest, accompanied by the development and testing of newer technologies.

As of 2010, major long-standing extraction industries are operating in [[Estonia]], [[Brazil]], and [[PRC|China]]. Its economic viability usually requires a lack of locally available crude oil. National [[energy security]] issues have also played a role in its development. Critics of shale oil extraction pose questions about [[environmental management]] issues, such as waste disposal, extensive water use, waste water management, and air pollution.

&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1894 invention of the [[Pumpherston retort]], which was much less reliant on coal heat than its predecessors, marked the separation of the [[oil shale industry]] from the coal industry.&lt;ref name=iom/&gt;

China ([[Manchuria]]), Estonia, [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], and [[Switzerland]] began extracting shale oil in the early 20th century. However, crude oil discoveries in [[Texas]] during the 1920s and in the [[Middle East]] in the mid 20th century brought most oil shale industries to a halt.&lt;ref name=wec/&gt;&lt;ref name=yen2&gt;

==Processing principles==
[[File:Oil shale extraction overview.png|thumb|right|300px|alt=A vertical [[flowchart]] begins with an [[oil shale]] deposit and follows two major branches.  Conventional ''ex situ'' processes, shown on the right, proceed through mining, crushing, and retorting. [[Spent shale]] output is noted. ''In situ'' process flows are shown in the left branch of the flowchart. The deposit may or may not be fractured; in either case, the deposit is retorted and the oil is recovered. The two major branches converge at the bottom of the chart, indicating that extraction is followed by [[refining]], which involves thermal and chemical treatment and [[hydrogenation]], yielding liquid fuels and useful byproducts.|Overview of shale oil extraction]]

Shale oil extraction process decomposes oil shale and converts its [[kerogen]] into shale oil&amp;mdash;a [[petroleum]]-like [[synthetic crude]] oil. The process is conducted by [[pyrolysis]], [[hydrogenation]], or [[thermal dissolution]].&lt;ref name=koel/&gt;&lt;ref name=luik&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efficiencies of extraction processes are often evaluated by comparing their yields to the results of a [[Fischer Assay]] performed on a sample of the shale.&lt;ref name=handbook2/&gt;

The oldest and the most common extraction method involves pyrolysis (also known as ''retorting'' or [[destructive distillation]]).  In this process, oil shale is heated in the absence of oxygen until its kerogen decomposes into condensable shale oil vapors and non-condensable [[Combustibility|combustible]] [[oil shale gas]].  Oil vapors and oil shale gas are then collected and cooled, causing the shale oil to [[Condensation|condense]].  In addition, oil shale processing produces spent oil shale, which is a solid residue. Spent shale consists of [[inorganic compound]]s ([[mineral]]s) and [[char]]&amp;mdash;a carbonaceous residue formed from kerogen. Burning the char off the spent shale produces oil shale ash. Spent shale and shale ash can be used as ingredients in cement or brick manufacture.&lt;ref name=koel/&gt;&lt;ref name=qian3&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The composition of the oil shale may lend added value to the extraction process through the recovery of by-products, including [[ammonia]], [[sulfur]], [[aromatic compound]]s, [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]], [[asphalt]], and [[wax]]es.&lt;ref name=fossilenergy/&gt;

Heating the oil shale to pyrolysis temperature and completing the [[endothermic]] kerogen decomposition reactions require a source of energy. Some technologies burn other [[fossil fuel]]s such as natural gas, oil, or coal to generate this heat and experimental methods have used electricity, [[radio wave]]s, [[microwave]]s, or [[Chemical reaction|reactive]] fluids for this purpose.&lt;ref name=AICHE&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Two strategies are used to reduce, and even eliminate, external heat energy requirements: the oil shale gas and char by-products generated by pyrolysis may be burned as a source of energy, and the heat contained in hot spent oil shale and oil shale ash may be used to pre-heat the raw oil shale.&lt;ref name=koel/&gt;

For ''ex situ'' processing, oil shale is crushed into smaller pieces, increasing surface area for better extraction.  The temperature at which decomposition of oil shale occurs depends on the time-scale of the process.  In ''ex situ'' retorting processes, it begins at {{convert|300|°C|°F|sp=us|-1}} and proceeds more rapidly and completely at higher temperatures.  The amount of oil produced is the highest when the temperature ranges between {{convert|480|and|520|C|F|sp=us|-1}}. The ratio of oil shale gas to shale oil generally increases along with retorting temperatures.&lt;ref name=koel&gt;

==Classification of extraction technologies==
Industry analysts have created several classifications of the technologies used to extract [[shale oil]] from oil shale.

''By process principles'': Based on the treatment of raw oil shale by heat and solvents the methods are classified as pyrolysis, hydrogenation, or thermal dissolution.&lt;ref name=luik/&gt;

''By location'': A frequently used distinction considers whether processing is done above or below ground, and classifies the technologies broadly as ''ex situ'' (displaced) or ''in situ'' (in place).  In ''ex situ'' processing, also known as above-ground [[retorting]], the oil shale is mined either [[Underground mining (soft rock)|underground]] or [[surface mining|at the surface]] and then transported to a processing facility.  In contrast, ''in situ'' processing converts the kerogen while it is still in the form of an oil shale deposit, following which it is then extracted via [[oil well]]s, where it rises in the same way as conventional crude oil.&lt;ref name=AICHE/&gt;  Unlike ''ex situ'' processing, it does not involve mining or spent oil shale disposal aboveground as spent oil shale stays underground.&lt;ref name=rand/&gt;

''By heating method'': The method of transferring heat from combustion products to the oil shale may be classified as direct or indirect. While methods that allow combustion products to contact the oil shale within the [[retort]] are classified as ''direct'', methods that burn materials external to the retort to heat another material that contacts the oil shale are described as ''indirect''&lt;ref name=qian/&gt;

''By heat carrier'': Based on the material used to deliver heat energy to the oil shale, processing technologies have been classified into gas heat carrier, solid heat carrier, wall conduction, reactive fluid, and volumetric heating methods.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;&lt;ref name=handbook2/&gt;&lt;ref name=AICHE/&gt;&lt;ref name=smith&gt;

''By raw oil shale particle size'': The various ''ex situ'' processing technologies may be differentiated by the size of the oil shale particles that are fed into the retorts. As a rule, gas heat carrier technologies process oil shale lumps varying in diameter from {{convert|10|to|100|mm|in|sp=us|1}}, while solid heat carrier and wall conduction technologies process fines which are particles less than {{convert|10|mm|in|sp=us|1}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=qian&gt;

''By retort orientation'': "Ex-situ" technologies are sometimes classified as vertical or horizontal. Vertical retorts are usually shaft kilns where a bed of shale moves from top to bottom by gravity.  Horizontal retorts are usually horizontal rotating drums or screws where shale moves from one end to the other.  As a general rule, vertical retorts process lumps using a gas heat carrier, while horizontal retorts process fines using solid heat carrier.

''By complexity of technology'': ''In situ'' technologies are usually classified either as ''true in situ'' processes or ''modified in situ'' processes. ''True in situ'' processes do not involve mining or crushing the oil shale. ''Modified in situ'' processes involve drilling and fracturing the target oil shale deposit to create voids in the deposit. The voids enable a better flow of gases and fluids through the deposit, thereby increasing the volume and quality of the shale oil produced.&lt;ref name=fossilenergy/&gt;

==''Ex situ'' technologies==

===Internal combustion===
Internal combustion technologies burn materials (typically char and oil shale gas) within a vertical shaft retort to supply heat for pyrolysis.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;&lt;ref name=AICHE/&gt;  Typically raw oil shale particles between {{convert|12|mm|in|1}} and {{convert|75|mm|in|1}} in size are fed into the top of the retort and are heated by the rising hot gases, which pass through the descending oil shale, thereby causing decomposition of the kerogen at about {{convert|500|°C|°F|sp=us}} . Shale oil mist, evolved gases and cooled combustion gases are removed from the top of the retort then moved to separation equipment. Condensed shale oil is collected, while non-condensable gas is recycled and used to carry heat up the retort. In the lower part of the retort, air is injected for the combustion which heats the spent oil shale and gases to between {{convert|700|°C|°F|sp=us}} and {{convert|900|°C|°F|sp=us}}. Cold recycled gas may enter the bottom of the retort to cool the shale ash.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;&lt;ref name=koel/&gt;&lt;ref name=fuelstodrive&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union A and Superior Direct processes depart from this pattern. In the Union A process, oil shale is fed through the bottom of the retort and a pump moves it upward.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;  In the Superior Direct process, oil shale is processed in a horizontal, segmented, doughnut-shaped [[traveling-grate retort]].&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;&lt;ref name=synthetic2/&gt;&lt;ref name=BLM2008appendix/&gt;

Internal combustion technologies such as the [[Paraho process|Paraho Direct]] are [[thermal efficiency|thermally efficient]], since combustion of char on the spent shale and heat recovered from the shale ash and evolved gases can provide all the heat requirements of the retort. These technologies can achieve 80-90% of Fischer assay yield.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; Two well-established shale oil industries use internal combustion technologies: Kiviter process facilities have been operated continuously in Estonia since the 1920s, and a number of Chinese companies operate [[Fushun process]] facilities.

Common drawbacks of internal combustion technologies are that the combustible oil shale gas is diluted by combustion gases &lt;ref name=smith/&gt; and particles smaller than {{convert|10|mm|in|sp=us|1}} can not be processed.  Uneven distribution of gas across the retort can result in blockages when hot spots cause particles to fuse or disintegrate.

===Hot recycled solids===
Hot recycled solids technologies deliver heat to the oil shale by recycling hot solid particles&amp;mdash;typically oil shale ash. These technologies usually employ [[rotary kiln|rotating kiln]] or [[fluidized bed]] retorts, fed by fine oil shale particles generally having a diameter of less than {{convert|10|mm|in|sp=us|1}}; some technologies use particles even smaller than {{convert|2.5|mm|in|sp=us|2}}. The recycled particles are heated in a separate chamber or vessel to about {{convert|800|°C|°F|sp=us}} and then mixed with the raw oil shale to cause the shale to decompose at about {{convert|500|°C|°F|sp=us}}.  Oil vapour and shale oil gas are separated from the solids and cooled to condense and collect the oil.  Heat recovered from the combustion gases and shale ash may be used to dry and preheat the raw oil shale before it is mixed with the hot recycle solids.

In the [[Galoter process|Galoter]] and [[Enefit process|Enefit]] processes, the spent oil shale is burnt in a separate furnace and the resulting hot ash is separated from the combustion gas and mixed with oil shale particles in a rotating kiln.  Combustion gases from the furnace are used to dry the oil shale in a dryer before mixing with hot ash.&lt;ref name=soone&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The distinguishing feature of the [[Alberta Taciuk Process]] (ATP) is that the entire process occurs in a single rotating multi&amp;ndash;chamber horizontal vessel.&lt;ref name=fossilenergy/&gt;&lt;ref name=qian/&gt;

Because the hot recycle solids are heated in a separate furnace, the oil shale gas from these technologies is not diluted with combustion exhaust gas.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;&lt;ref name=AICHE/&gt; Another advantage is that there is no limit on the smallest particles that the retort can process, thus allowing all the crushed feed to be used. One disadvantge is that more water is used to handle the resulting finer shale ash.

[[File:Alberta Taciuk Processor.PNG|thumb|540px|center|alt=Diagram of the [[Alberta Taciuk Process|Alberta Taciuk Processor retort]]. It is a horizontal cylinder {{convert|8.2|m|sp=us}} high and {{convert|62.5|m|sp=us}} wide. The raw oil shale is fed from the right side and it moves to a section where it is dried and preheated by hot oil shale ash. The temperature in this section is around {{convert|250|°C|°F}}. At the same time, the raw oil shale in this section serves to cool the resultant oil shale ash before its removal. In the retorting section, the temperature is around {{convert|500|°C|°F}}. Oil vapors are removed through the vapor tube. The spent oil shale is again heated in the combustion section to a temperature of {{convert|750|°C|°F}} and ash is generated. The ash is then sent to the retorting section as a heat carrier, or to the cooling zone for removal.|Alberta Taciuk Processor retort]]

===Conduction through a wall===
These technologies transfer heat to the oil shale by conducting it through the retort wall. The shale feed usually consists of fine particles. Their advantage lies in the fact that retort vapors are not combined with combustion exhaust.&lt;ref name=assessment&gt;

A general drawback of conduction through a wall technologies is that the retorts are more costly when scaled-up due to the resulting large amount of heat conducting walls made of high-temperature alloys.

===Externally generated hot gas===
In general, externally generated hot gas technologies are similar to internal combustion technologies in that they also process oil shale lumps in vertical shaft kilns. Significantly, though, the heat in these technologies is delivered by gases heated outside the retort vessel, and therefore the retort vapors are not diluted with combustion exhaust.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;&lt;ref name=AICHE/&gt; The [[Petrosix]] and [[Paraho process|Paraho Indirect]] employ this technology.&lt;ref name=fossilenergy/&gt;&lt;ref name=laherrere&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to not accepting fine particles as feed, these technologies do not utilize the potential heat of combusting the char on the spent shale and thus must burn more valuable fuels.  However, due to the lack of combustion of the spent shale, the oil shale does not exceed {{convert|500|°C|°F|0}} and significant carbonate mineral decomposition and subsequent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation can be avoided for some oil shales.  Also, these technologies tend to be the more stable and easier to control than internal combustion or hot solid recycle technologies.

===Reactive fluids===

Kerogen is tightly bound to the shale and resists dissolution by most [[solvent]]s.&lt;ref name=sung/&gt; Despite this constraint, extraction using especially reactive fluids has been tested, including those in a [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] state.&lt;ref name=sung&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojovooEaWhgC&amp;pg=PA109|title=Oil shale technology|pages=109, 110|author=Sunggyu Lee|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|isbn=978-0-8493-4615-6|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reactive fluid technologies are suitable for processing oil shales with a low hydrogen content.

==''In situ'' technologies==

''[[In situ]]'' technologies heat oil shale underground by injecting hot fluids into the rock formation, or by using linear or planar heating sources followed by [[Conduction (heat)|thermal conduction]] and [[convection]] to distribute heat through the target area. Shale oil is then recovered through vertical wells drilled into the formation.&lt;ref name=DOE/&gt; These technologies are potentially able to extract more shale oil from a given area of land than conventional ''[[ex situ]]'' processing technologies, as the wells can reach greater depths than surface mines.  They present an opportunity to recover shale oil from low-grade deposits that [[traditional mining]] techniques could not extract.&lt;ref name=kok&gt;

Externally generated hot gas ''in situ'' technologies use hot gases heated above-ground and then injected into the oil shale formation.  The [[Chevron CRUSH]] process, which was researched by [[Chevron Corporation]] in partnership with [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], injects heated carbon dioxide into the formation via drilled wells and to heat the formation through a series of horizontal fractures through which the gas is circulated.&lt;ref name=chevron&gt;

The [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] developed the concept of oil shale volumetric heating using [[radio waves]] (radio frequency processing) during the late 1970s.  This technology was further developed by [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]].  Oil shale is heated by vertical [[electrode array]]s. Deeper volumes could be processed at slower heating rates by installations spaced at tens of meters. The concept presumes a radio frequency at which the [[skin depth]] is many tens of meters, thereby overcoming the thermal diffusion times needed for conductive heating.&lt;ref name=AICHE/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burnham"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The various attempts to develop oil shale deposits have succeeded only when the shale-oil production cost in a given region is lower than the price of petroleum or its other substitutes. According to a survey conducted by the [[RAND Corporation]], the cost of producing shale oil at a hypothetical surface retorting complex in the United States (comprising a mine, retorting plant, [[upgrader|upgrading plant]], supporting utilities, and spent oil shale reclamation), would be in a range of $70–95 per barrel ($440–600/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), adjusted to 2005 values.  Assuming a gradual increase in output after the start of commercial production, the analysis projects a gradual reduction in processing costs to $30–40 per barrel ($190–250/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) after achieving the milestone of {{convert|1|Goilbbl|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=eu&gt;

Other ways of improving the economics of shale oil extraction could be to increase the size of the operation to achieve [[economies of scale]], use oil shale that is a by-product of coal mining such as at [[Fushun]] China, produce [[specialty chemicals]] as by [[Viru Keemia Grupp]] in Estonia, co-generate electricity from the waste heat and  process high grade oil shale that yields more oil per shale processed.

A possible measure of the viability of oil shale as an energy source lies in the ratio of the energy in the extracted oil to the energy used in its mining and processing (Energy Returned on Energy Invested, or [[EROEI]]). A 1984 study estimated the EROEI of the various known oil shale deposits as varying between 0.7–13.3;&lt;ref name=science2&gt;

Commonly detected examples include [[quinoline]] derivatives, [[pyridine]], and various alkyl homologues of pyridine ([[picoline]], [[lutidine]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sims, G. K. and E.J. O'Loughlin. 1989. Degradation of pyridines in the environment. CRC Critical Reviews in Environmental Control. 19(4): 309-340.&lt;/ref&gt;

Water concerns are sensitive issues in arid regions, such as the western US and Israel's [[Negev|Negev Desert]], where plans exist to expand oil-shale extraction despite a water shortage.&lt;ref&gt;

He is known to have translated and modified the [[Zij al-Sindhind]]. The Zij al-Sindhind was the first astronomical table ever introduced in the [[Muslim World]]. As a mathematician Sanad ibn ʿAlī was a colleague of [[al-Khwarizmi]] and worked closely with [[Yaqūb ibn Tāriq]] together they calculated the [[diameter]] of the [[Earth]] and other astronomical bodies. He also wrote a commentary on ''Kitāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala'' and helped prove the works of [[al-Khwarizmi]]. The [[decimal point]] notation to the [[Arabic numerals]] was introduced by Sanad ibn Ali.

According to [[Ibn Abi Usaibia]]: the [[Banū Mūsā]] brothers out of  sheer professional jealousy kept him away from [[Abbasid Caliph]] [[al-Mutawakkil]] at his new capital [[Samarra]] and had caused Sanad ibn ʿAlī to be sent away to [[Baghdad]]. Both [[Ja'far Muhammad ibn Mūsā ibn Shākir]] and [[Ahmad ibn Mūsā ibn Shākir]] delegated the work of digging a great [[canal]] instead to [[Al-Farghani]] and thus ignoring Sanad ibn ʿAlī, the better engineer. [[Al-Farghani]] committed a great error, making the beginning of the canal deeper than the rest and water never reached the new garrison of ''Al-Ja'fariya''. News of this greatly angered [[al-Mutawakkil]] and the two [[Banū Mūsā]] brothers were saved from severe punishment only by the gracious willingness of Sanad ibn ʿAlī, to vouch the corrections of [[Al-Farghani]]'s calculations thus risking his own welfare and possibly his life.

[[File:Operating system placement (software).svg|thumb|upright|A diagram showing how the [[User (computing)|user]] interacts with [[application software]] on a typical [[desktop computer]].The application software layer interfaces with the [[operating system]], which in turn communicates with the [[Personal computer hardware|hardware]]. The arrows indicate information flow.]]

'''Computer software''', or simply '''software''', is a collection of [[data (computing)|data]] or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work. This is in contrast to [[Computer hardware|physical hardware]], from which the system is built and actually performs the work. In [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]], computer software is all [[information]] processed by [[computer system]]s, [[Computer program|program]]s and [[data]]. Computer software includes [[computer program]]s, [[Library (computing)|libraries]] and related non-executable [[Data (computing)|data]], such as [[Software documentation|online documentation]] or [[digital media]]. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.

At the lowest programming level,{{Clarify|reason=What 'level' means can be unclear to non-technical readers|date=August 2018}} [[executable code]] consists of [[Machine code|machine language]] instructions supported by an individual [[Microprocessor|processor]]—typically a [[central processing unit]] (CPU) or a [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU). A machine language consists of groups of [[Binary numbers|binary values]] signifying [[Instruction (computing)|processor instructions]] that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer—an effect that is not directly observable to the user. An instruction [[System call|may also invoke]] one of many [[Input/output|input or output operations]], for example displaying some text on a computer screen; causing state changes which should be visible to the [[User (computing)|user]]. The processor [[Instruction cycle|executes]] the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to [[branch instruction|"jump" to a different instruction]], or is [[Interrupt|interrupted]] by the operating system. {{As of|2015}}, most [[Personal computer|personal computers]], [[smartphone]] devices and [[Server (computing)|servers]] have [[Multi-core processor|processors with multiple execution units]] or [[Multiprocessing|multiple processors performing computation]] together, and computing has become a much more [[Concurrent computing|concurrent]] activity than in the past.

The majority of software is written in [[high-level programming language]]s. They are easier and more efficient for programmers because they are closer to [[natural language]]s than machine languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Compiler construction|url=http://www.cs.uu.nl/education/vak.php?vak=INFOMCCO|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102143144/http://www.cs.uu.nl/education/vak.php?vak=INFOMCCO|archivedate=2 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-level languages are translated into machine language using a [[compiler]] or an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] or a combination of the two. Software may also be written in a low-level [[assembly language]], which has strong correspondence to the computer's machine language instructions and is translated into machine language using an [[Assembly language|assembler]].

==History==
{{Main article|History of software}}
An outline ([[algorithm]]) for what would have been the first piece of software was written by [[Ada Lovelace]] in the 19th century, for the planned [[Analytical Engine]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=21}} She created [[Mathematical proof|proofs]] to show how the engine would calculate [[Bernoulli number|Bernoulli Numbers]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=21}} Because of the proofs and algorithm, she is considered the first computer programmer.&lt;ref name="Annals of the History of Computing"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fuegi|first=J.|last2=Francis|first2=J.|date=2003|title=Lovelace &amp; Babbage and the creation of the 1843 'notes'|journal=Annals of the History of Computing|volume=25|issue=4|pages=16–26|doi=10.1109/MAHC.2003.1253887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovelace Google"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/dec/10/ada-lovelace-honoured-google-doodle|title=Ada Lovelace honoured by Google doodle|last=|first=|date=December 10, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first theory about software—prior to creation of computers as we know them today—was proposed by Alan Turing in his 1935 essay ''On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem'' (decision problem).

This eventually led to the creation of the academic fields of [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]]; Both fields study software and its creation. Computer science is the theoretical study of computer and software (Turing's essay is an example of computer science), whereas software engineering is the application of engineering and development of software.

However, prior to 1946, software was not yet the programs stored in the memory of stored-program digital computers, as we now understand it. The first electronic computing devices were instead rewired in order to "reprogram" them.

==Types==
{{See also|List of software categories}}

On virtually all computer platforms, software can be grouped into a few broad categories.

===Purpose, or domain of use===
{{Ecommerce}}
Based on the goal, computer software can be divided into:

* '''[[Application software]]''' &lt;br&gt; which is software that uses the computer system to perform special functions or provide [[video game|entertainment functions]] beyond the basic operation of the computer itself. There are many different types of application software, because the range of tasks that can be performed with a modern computer is so large—see [[list of software]].
* '''[[System software]]''' &lt;br&gt; which is software that directly operates the '''[[computer hardware]]''', to provide basic functionality needed by users and other software, and to provide a platform for running application software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=System Software|url=http://home.olemiss.edu/~misbook/sfsysfm.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010530092843/http://home.olemiss.edu/~misbook/sfsysfm.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 May 2001|publisher=The University of Mississippi|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; System software includes:
** '''[[Operating system]]s''' &lt;br&gt; which are essential collections of software that manage resources and provides common services for other software that runs "on top" of them. [[Supervisory program]]s, [[boot loader]]s, [[shell (computing)|shells]] and [[window system]]s are core parts of operating systems. In practice, an operating system comes bundled with additional software (including application software) so that a user can potentially do some work with a computer that only has one operating system.
** '''[[Device driver]]s''' &lt;br&gt; which operate or control a particular type of device that is attached to a computer. Each device needs at least one corresponding device driver; because a computer typically has at minimum at least one input device and at least one output device, a computer typically needs more than one device driver.
** '''[[Software utility|Utilities]]''' &lt;br&gt; which are computer [[Programs and Features|programs]] designed to assist users in the maintenance and care of their computers.
* '''[[Malicious software]]''' or '''malware''' &lt;br&gt; which is software that is developed to harm and disrupt computers. As such, malware is undesirable. Malware is closely associated with computer-related crimes, though some malicious programs may have been designed as [[practical joke]]s.

===Nature or domain of execution===
* [[Desktop applications]] such as [[web browser]]s and [[Microsoft Office]], as well as [[smartphone]] and [[Tablet computer|tablet]] applications (called "[[mobile app|apps]]"). (There is a push in some parts of the software industry to merge desktop applications with mobile apps, to some extent. [[Windows 8]], and later [[Ubuntu Touch]], tried to allow the same style of application user interface to be used on desktops, laptops and mobiles.)
* [[JavaScript]] scripts are pieces of software traditionally embedded in [[web pages]] that are run directly inside the [[web browser]] when a web page is loaded without the need for a web browser plugin. Software written in other programming languages can also be run within the web browser if the software is either translated into JavaScript, or if a web browser plugin that supports that language is installed; the most common example of the latter is [[ActionScript]] scripts, which are supported by the [[Adobe Flash]] plugin.
* [[Server software]], including:
** [[Web application]]s, which usually run on the [[web server]] and output dynamically generated web pages to web browsers, using e.g. [[PHP]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[ASP.NET]], or even [[Node.js|JavaScript that runs on the server]]. In modern times these commonly include some JavaScript to be run in the web browser as well, in which case they typically run partly on the server, partly in the web browser.
* [[Plug-in (computing)|Plugins]] and extensions are software that extends or modifies the functionality of another piece of software, and require that software be used in order to function;
* [[Embedded software]] resides as [[firmware]] within [[embedded system]]s, devices dedicated to a single use or a few uses such as [[car]]s and [[television]]s (although some embedded devices such as wireless chipsets can ''themselves'' be part of an ordinary, non-embedded computer system such as a PC or smartphone).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Embedded Software—Technologies and Trends|url=http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/so/2009/03/mso2009030014.html|publisher=IEEE Computer Society|date=May–June 2009|accessdate=6 November 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028045823/http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/so/2009/03/mso2009030014.html|archivedate=28 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the embedded system context there is sometimes no clear distinction between the system software and the application software. However, some embedded systems run [[embedded operating system]]s, and these systems do retain the distinction between system software and application software (although typically there will only be one, fixed, application which is always run).
* [[Microcode]] is a special, relatively obscure type of embedded software which tells the processor ''itself'' how to execute machine code, so it is actually a lower level than machine code. It is typically proprietary to the processor manufacturer, and any necessary correctional microcode software updates are supplied by them to users (which is much cheaper than shipping replacement processor hardware). Thus an ordinary programmer would not expect to ever have to deal with it.

===Programming tools===
{{Main article|Programming tool}}
Programming tools are also software in the form of programs or applications that [[software developer]]s (also known as
''programmers, coders, hackers'' or ''software engineers'') use to create, [[Debugging|debug]], [[Software maintenance|maintain]] (i.e. improve or fix), or otherwise [[Technical support|support]] software. 

Software is written in one or more programming languages; there are many programming languages in existence, and each has at least one implementation, each of which consists of its own set of programming tools. These tools may be relatively self-contained programs such as [[compiler]]s, [[debugger]]s, [[interpreter (computing)|interpreters]], [[linker (computing)|linkers]], and [[text editor]]s, that can be combined together to accomplish a task; or they may form an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE), which combines much or all of the functionality of such self-contained tools. IDEs may do this by either invoking the relevant individual tools or by re-implementing their functionality in a new way. An IDE can make it easier to do specific tasks, such as searching in files in a particular project. Many programming language implementations provide the option of using both individual tools or an IDE.

==Topics==
===Architecture===
{{See also|Software architecture}}
Users often see things differently from programmers. People who use modern general purpose computers (as opposed to [[embedded system]]s, [[analog computer]]s and [[supercomputer]]s) usually see three layers of software performing a variety of tasks: platform, application, and user software.

* '''Platform software''' &lt;br&gt; The [[Platform (computing)|Platform]] includes the [[firmware]], [[device driver]]s, an [[operating system]], and typically a [[graphical user interface]] which, in total, allow a user to interact with the computer and its [[peripheral]]s (associated equipment). Platform software often comes bundled with the computer. On a [[Personal computer|PC]] one will usually have the ability to change the platform software.
* '''Application software''' &lt;br&gt; [[Application software]] or Applications are what most people think of when they think of software. Typical examples include office suites and video games. [[Application software]] is often purchased separately from computer hardware. Sometimes applications are bundled with the computer, but that does not change the fact that they run as independent applications. Applications are usually independent programs from the operating system, though they are often tailored for specific platforms. Most users think of compilers, databases, and other "system software" as applications.
* '''User-written software''' &lt;br&gt; [[End-user development]] tailors systems to meet users' specific needs. User software include spreadsheet templates and [[word processor]] templates. Even email filters are a kind of user software. Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is. Depending on how competently the user-written software has been integrated into default application packages, many users may not be aware of the distinction between the original packages, and what has been added by co-workers.

===Execution===
{{Main article|Execution (computing)}}
Computer software has to be "loaded" into the [[computer storage|computer's storage]] (such as the [[hard drive]] or [[Computer memory|memory]]). Once the software has loaded, the computer is able to ''execute'' the software. This involves passing [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] from the [[application software]], through the system software, to the hardware which ultimately receives the instruction as [[machine language|machine code]]. Each instruction causes the computer to carry out an operation—moving [[data (computing)|data]], carrying out a [[computation]], or altering the [[control flow]] of instructions.

Data movement is typically from one place in memory to another. Sometimes it involves moving data between memory and registers which enable high-speed data access in the CPU. Moving data, especially large amounts of it, can be costly. So, this is sometimes avoided by using "pointers" to data instead. Computations include simple operations such as incrementing the value of a variable data element. More complex computations may involve many operations and data elements together.&lt;!-- This section is simply to long for this article and needs to be compressed into the intro above, or moved to the article itself.

Instructions may be performed sequentially, conditionally, or iteratively. Sequential instructions are those operations that are performed one after another. Conditional instructions are performed such that different sets of instructions execute depending on the value(s) of some data. In some languages this is known as an "if" statement. Iterative instructions are performed repetitively and may depend on some data value. This is sometimes called a "loop." Often, one instruction may "call" another set of instructions that are defined in some other program or [[module (programming)|module]]. When more than one computer processor is used, instructions may be executed simultaneously.

A simple example of the way software operates is what happens when a user selects an entry such as "Copy" from a menu. In this case, a conditional instruction is executed to copy text from data in a 'document' area residing in memory, perhaps to an intermediate storage area known as a 'clipboard' data area. If a different menu entry such as "Paste" is chosen, the software may execute the instructions to copy the text from the clipboard data area to a specific location in the same or another document in memory.

Depending on the application, even the example above could become complicated. The field of software engineering endeavors to manage the complexity of how software operates. This is especially true for software that operates in the context of a large or powerful [[computer system]].

Currently, almost the only limitations on the use of computer software in applications is the ingenuity of the designer/programmer. Consequently, large areas of activities (such as playing grand master level chess) formerly assumed to be incapable of software simulation are now routinely programmed. The only area that has so far proved reasonably secure from software simulation is the realm of human art— especially, pleasing music and literature.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Kinds of software by operation: [[computer program]] as [[executable]], [[source code]] or [[script (computer programming)|script]], [[computer configuration|configuration]].--&gt;

===Quality and reliability===
{{Main article|Software quality|Software testing|Software reliability}}
Software quality is very important, especially for [[commercial software|commercial]] and system software like [[Microsoft Office]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Linux]]. If software is faulty (buggy), it can delete a person's work, crash the computer and do other unexpected things. Faults and errors are called "[[Software bug|bugs]]" which are often discovered during alpha and beta testing. Software is often also a victim to what is known as [[software aging]], the progressive performance degradation resulting from a combination of unseen bugs.

Many bugs are discovered and eliminated (debugged) through [[software testing]]. However, software testing rarely—if ever—eliminates every bug; some programmers say that "every program has at least one more bug" (Lubarsky's Law).&lt;ref name="github"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://github.com/mark-watson/scripting-intelligence-book-examples/blob/master/part1/wikipedia_text/software.txt | title=scripting intelligence book examples | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106154317/https://github.com/mark-watson/scripting-intelligence-book-examples/blob/master/part1/wikipedia_text/software.txt | archivedate=6 November 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Waterfall model|waterfall]] method of software development, separate testing teams are typically employed, but in newer approaches, collectively termed [[agile software development]], developers often do all their own testing, and demonstrate the software to users/clients regularly to obtain feedback. Software can be tested through [[unit testing]], [[regression testing]] and other methods, which are done manually, or most commonly, automatically, since the amount of code to be tested can be quite large. For instance, [[NASA]] has extremely rigorous software testing procedures for many operating systems and communication functions. Many NASA-based operations interact and identify each other through command programs. This enables many people who work at NASA to check and evaluate functional systems overall. Programs containing command software enable hardware engineering and system operations to function much easier together.

===License===
{{Main article|Software license}}
The software's license gives the user the right to use the software in the licensed environment, and in the case of [[free software license]]s, also grants other rights such as the right to make copies.

[[Proprietary software]] can be divided into two types:

* [[freeware]], which includes the category of "free trial" software or "[[freemium]]" software (in the past, the term [[shareware]] was often used for free trial/freemium software). As the name suggests, freeware can be used free, although in the case of free trials or freemium software, this is sometimes only true for a limited period of time or with limited functionality.
* software available for a fee, often inaccurately termed "[[commercial software]]", which can only be legally used on purchase of a license.

[[Open source software]], on the other hand, comes with a [[free software license]], granting the recipient the rights to modify and redistribute the software.

===Patents===
{{Main article|Software patent|Software patent debate}}
Software patents, like other types of patents, are theoretically supposed to give an inventor an exclusive, time-limited license for a ''detailed idea (e.g. an algorithm) on how to implement'' a piece of software, or a component of a piece of software. Ideas for useful things that software could ''do'', and user ''requirements'', are not supposed to be patentable, and concrete implementations (i.e. the actual software packages implementing the patent) are not supposed to be patentable either—the latter are already covered by copyright, generally automatically. So software patents are supposed to cover the middle area, between requirements and concrete implementation. In some countries, a requirement for the claimed invention to have an effect on the physical world may also be part of the requirements for a software patent to be held valid—although since ''all'' useful software has effects on the physical world, this requirement may be open to debate. Meanwhile, American copyright law was applied to various aspects of the writing of the software code.&lt;ref&gt; Gerardo Con Díaz, "The Text in the Machine: American Copyright Law and the Many Natures of Software, 1974–1978,” ''Technology and Culture'' 57 (October 2016), 753–79.  &lt;/ref&gt;

Software patents are controversial in the software industry with many people holding different views about them. One of the sources of controversy is that the aforementioned split between initial ideas and patent does not seem to be honored in practice by patent lawyers—for example the patent for [[Aspect-Oriented Programming]] (AOP), which purported to claim rights over ''any'' programming tool implementing the idea of AOP, howsoever implemented. Another source of controversy is the effect on innovation, with many distinguished experts and companies arguing that software is such a fast-moving field that software patents merely create vast additional litigation costs and risks, and actually retard innovation. In the case of debates about software patents outside the United States, the argument has been made that large American corporations and patent lawyers are likely to be the primary beneficiaries of allowing or continue to allow software patents.

==Design and implementation==
{{Main article|Software development|Computer programming|Software engineering}}
Design and implementation of software varies depending on the complexity of the software. For instance, the design and creation of [[Microsoft Word]] took much more time than designing and developing [[Microsoft Notepad]] because the latter has much more basic functionality.

Software is usually designed and created (aka coded/written/programmed) in [[integrated development environment]]s (IDE) like [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]], [[IntelliJ IDEA|IntelliJ]] and [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] that can simplify the process and [[compiler|compile]] the software (if applicable). As noted in a different section, software is usually created on top of existing software and the [[application programming interface]] (API) that the underlying software provides like [[GTK+]], JavaBeans or [[Swing (Java)|Swing]]. Libraries (APIs) can be categorized by their purpose. For instance, the [[Spring framework|Spring Framework]] is used for implementing [[enterprise application]]s, the [[Windows Forms]] library is used for designing graphical user interface (GUI) applications like [[Microsoft Word]], and [[Windows Communication Foundation]] is used for designing [[web service]]s. When a program is designed, it relies upon the API. For instance, a Microsoft Windows desktop application might call API functions in the [[.NET Framework|.NET]] Windows Forms library like ''Form1.Close()'' and ''Form1.Show()''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/default.aspx |title=MSDN Library |accessdate=2010-06-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611204810/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/default.aspx |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to close or open the application. Without these APIs, the programmer needs to write these functionalities entirely themselves. Companies like [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] and [[Microsoft]] provide their own APIs so that many applications are written using their [[Library (computing)|software libraries]] that usually have numerous APIs in them.

[[Data structure]]s such as [[hash table]]s, [[array data type|arrays]], and [[binary tree]]s, and [[algorithm]]s such as [[quicksort]], can be useful for creating software.

Computer software has special economic characteristics that make its design, creation, and distribution different from most other economic goods.{{Specify|Which characteristics?|date=May 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=v. Engelhardt, Sebastian |year=2008 |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/jrp/jrpwrp/2008-045.html |title=The Economic Properties of Software |journal=Jena Economic Research Papers |volume=2 |issue=2008–045. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105145954/https://ideas.repec.org/p/jrp/jrpwrp/2008-045.html |archivedate=5 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dankaminsky.com/1999/03/02/69/ |title=Why Open Source Is The Optimum Economic Paradigm for Software |first=Dan |last=Kaminsky |year=1999 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522001231/http://dankaminsky.com/1999/03/02/69/ |archivedate=22 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who creates software is called a [[programmer]], [[software engineer]] or [[software developer]], terms that all have a similar meaning. More informal terms for programmer also exist such as "coder" and "'''hacker'''"{{Spaced ndash}}although use of the latter word may cause confusion, because it is more often used to mean [[Hacker (computer security)|someone who illegally breaks into computer systems]].

==Industry and organizations==
{{Main article|Software industry}}
A great variety of software companies and programmers in the world comprise a software industry. Software can be quite a profitable industry: [[Bill Gates]], the co-founder of [[Microsoft]] was the richest person in the world in 2009, largely due to his ownership of a significant number of shares in Microsoft, the company responsible for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Microsoft Office]] software products - both market leaders in their respective product categories.

Non-profit software organizations include the [[Free Software Foundation]], [[GNU Project]] and [[Mozilla Foundation]]. Software standard organizations like the [[W3C]], [[IETF]] develop recommended software standards such as [[XML]], [[HTTP]] and [[HTML]], so that software can interoperate through these standards.

Other well-known large software companies include [[Google]], [[IBM]], [[TCS]], [[Infosys]], [[Wipro]], [[HCL Technologies]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Novell]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[Symantec]], [[Adobe Systems]], [[Sidetrade]] and [[Corel]], while small companies often provide innovation.

A '''subscriber loop carrier''' or '''subscriber line carrier''' ('''SLC''') provides [[telephone exchange]]-like [[telephone]] interface functionality. An SLC remote terminal is typically located in an area with a high density of telephone subscribers, such as a residential neighborhood, that is remote from the telephone company's central office. Two or four [[Digital Signal 1|T1]] circuits (depending on the configuration) connect the SLC remote terminal to the central office terminal (COT), in the case of a universal subscriber loop carrier (USLC).  An integrated subscriber loop carrier (ISLC) has its [[T-span]]s terminating directly in time division switching equipment in the [[telephone exchange]].

One system serves up to 96 customers. This configuration is more efficient than the alternative of having separate copper pairs between each [[service termination point]] (the subscriber's location) and the central telephone exchange. 

These systems are generally installed in cabinets that have some form of [[uninterruptible power supply]] or other backup battery arrangements, and sometimes with additional equipment such as remote [[DSLAM]]s.

The '''Teletype Corporation''', a part of [[AT&amp;T Corporation|American Telephone and Telegraph Company]]'s [[Western Electric]] manufacturing arm since 1930, came into being in 1928 when the [[Morkrum-Kleinschmidt]] Company changed its name to the name of its trademark equipment.&lt;ref name="TeletypeStory"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.samhallas.co.uk/repository/telegraph/teletype_story.pdf|title=The Teletype Story |publisher=Teletype Corporation|year=1957 |accessdate=2011-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teletype Corporation, of [[Skokie, Illinois]], was responsible for the research, development and manufacture of data and record communications equipment, but it is primarily remembered for the manufacture of electromechanical [[teleprinter]]s.

Because of the nature of its business, as stated in the corporate charter, Teletype Corporation was allowed a unique mode of operation within Western Electric. It was organized as a separate entity, and contained all the elements necessary for a separate corporation. Teletype's charter permitted the sale of equipment to customers outside the AT&amp;T [[Bell System]], which explained their need for a separate sales force. The primary customer outside of the Bell System was the United States Government.

The Teletype Corporation continued in this manner until January 8, 1982, the date of settlement of ''[[United States v. AT&amp;T]]'', a 1974 United States Department of Justice antitrust suit against AT&amp;T. At that time, Western Electric was fully absorbed into AT&amp;T as [[AT&amp;T Technologies]], and the Teletype Corporation became AT&amp;T Teletype. The last vestiges of what had been the Teletype Corporation ceased in 1990, bringing to a close the dedicated teleprinter business.
One of the three Teletype manufacturing buildings in Skokie remains in use as a parking garage for a shopping center. Every other floor of the building has been removed. The other two buildings were demolished.

==History==
[[File:What-is-teletype.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=What is Teletype?|A Teletype Corporation advertisement from 1957.]]The Teletype Corporation had its roots in the [[Morkrum]] Company. In 1902, electrical engineer Frank Pearne approached [[Joy Morton]], head of Morton Salt, seeking a sponsor for Pearne's research into the practicalities of developing a printing telegraph system. Joy Morton needed to determine whether this was worthwhile and so consulted mechanical engineer [[Charles L. Krum|Charles Krum]], who was vice president of the Western Cold Storage Company, which was run by Morton’s brother [[Mark Morton (businessman)|Mark Morton]]. Krum was interested in helping Pearne, so space was set up in a laboratory in the attic of Western Cold Storage. Frank Pearne lost interest in the project after a year, and left to become a teacher. Krum was prepared to continue Pearne’s work, and in August 1903 a patent was filed for a "typebar page printer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

In 1904, Krum filed a patent for a "type wheel printing telegraph machine"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | 
url=http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00862402&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D0862402.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F0862402%2526RS%3DPN%2F0862402&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page | title=U.S. Patent 862,402| accessdate=2011-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was issued in August 1907.

In 1906, the Morkrum Company was formed, with the company name combining the Morton and Krum names and reflecting the financial assistance provided by Joy Morton. This is the time when Charles Krum's son, Howard Krum, joined his father in this work. It was Howard who developed and patented the start-stop synchronizing method for code telegraph systems, which made possible the practical teleprinter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

In 1908, a working teleprinter was produced, called the Morkrum Printing Telegraph, which was field tested with the Alton Railroad.

In 1910, the Morkrum Company designed and installed the first commercial teletypewriter system on Postal Telegraph Company lines between Boston and New York City using the "Blue Code Version" of the Morkrum Printing Telegraph.&lt;ref name="Colin Hempstead, William E. Worthington 2005 605"&gt;{{cite book |author=Colin Hempstead, William E.

In 1925, the Morkrum Company and the Kleinschmidt Electric Company merged to form the Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Company.

In December 1928, the company changed its name to the less cumbersome "Teletype Corporation".

In 1930, the Teletype Corporation was purchased by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company for $30,000,000 in stock and became a subsidiary of the Western Electric Company. While other principals in the Teletype Corporation retired, Howard Krum stayed on as a consultant.

===Morkrum Company===
* '''Morkrum Printing Telegraph'''&amp;nbsp;– This was the first mechanically successful teleprinter, initially used to 1908 for the Alton Railroad trials. A "Blue Code Version" was used in 1910 as a part of the first commercial teleprinter circuit that ran on Postal Telegraph Company lines between Boston and New York City. In 1914, a "Green Code Version" was installed using Western Union Telegraph Company lines for the Associated Press and was used to distribute news to competing newspapers in New York City.&lt;ref name="Colin Hempstead, William E.

Teletype models and their dates:

* '''Model 15''' (1930)
The '''Teletype Model 15''' is a Baudot code page printer; the mainstay of U.S. military communications in [[World War II]]. A reliable, heavy-duty machine with a cast frame.&lt;ref name="Queensland"/&gt; In 1930, Sterling Morton, Howard L. Krum, and Edward E. Kleinschmidt filed an application for a U.S. patent covering the commercial form of the Model 15 page printer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=01904164&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO2%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsearch-bool.html%2526r%3D2%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526co1%3DAND%2526d%3DPALL%2526s1%3D1,904,164%2526OS%3D1,904,164%2526RS%3D1,904,164&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page |title=U.S. Patent No. 1,904,164 | accessdate=2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://bitsavers.org/communications/teletype/15/144_Model15_Descr_Feb31.pdf | title=Description, Typebar Page Printer (Model 15) | publisher=Teletype Corporation | volume=Bulletin No. 144 | location=Chicago | year=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 200,000 Model 15 teleprinters were built. The Model 15 stands out as one of a few machines that remained in production for many years, remaining in production until 1963, a total of 33 years of continuous production. The production run was stretched somewhat by World War II — the Model 28 was scheduled to replace the Model 15 in the mid-1940s, but Teletype built so many factories to produce the Model 15 during World War II that it was more economical to continue mass production of the Model 15. The Model 15, in its "receive only" configuration with no keyboard, was the classic "news Teletype" until the 1950s, when the news wire services began to move to [[Teleprinter#Teletypesetter|TeleTypeSetter]] feeds.&lt;ref name="Sloan"&gt;{{cite book|title=American Journalism: History, Principles, Practices|editor= W.

* '''Model 19''' (1940)
The '''Teletype Model 19''' is a Model 15 with an integrated paper tape perforator and a Model 14 Transmitter-Distributor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TELETYPE MODEL 19 SET|url=http://www.baudot.net/teletype/M19.htm|website=baudot.net|accessdate=2012-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Model 20''' (1940)
The '''Teletype Model 20''' is an upper/lower case Type Bar Page Printer available as a receive only machine or a send-receive machine with four rows of keys, using a six-bit code for [[Teleprinter#Teletypesetter|TeleTypeSetter]] (TTS) use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/teletype/161_Model20_Descr_Mar40.pdf|title=Teletype Corporation- Description Type Bar Page Printer Model 20 – Bulletin No. 161, Issue 1, March 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baudot.net/teletype/M20.htm |title=Teletype Model 20 Page Printer |website=baudot.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Model 26''' (1939)
The '''Teletype Model 26''' is a Baudot code page printer; a lower-cost machine using a typewheel. The platen and paper moved while typing, like a manual typewriter.

* '''Model 28''' (1951)
{{main|Teletype Model 28}}
The '''Teletype Model 28''' is a product line of page printers, typing and non-typing tape perforator and tape reperforators, fixed-head single contact and pivoted head multi-contact transmitter-distributors, and receiving selector equipment. Regarded as the most rugged machines that the Teletype Corporation built, this line of teleprinters used an exchangeable type box for printing, and a sequential selector "Stunt Box" to mechanically initiate non-printing functions within the typing unit of the page printer, electrically control functions within the page printer and electrically control external equipment. The Teletype Corporation introduced the Model 28 as a commercial product in 1953, after this product had originally been designed for the US Military.&lt;ref name="baudot.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baudot.net/docs/house--teletype-corp-synopsis.pdf|title=A Synopsis of Teletype Corporation History|website=baudot.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with the Model 28, Teletype page printer model numbers were often modified by letters indicating the configuration. The configurations, in increasing order of equipment level and cost, were:
* '''RO'''&amp;nbsp;– Receive Only, with a printer and no keyboard or built-in paper tape reader or punch
* '''KSR'''&amp;nbsp;– Keyboard Send and Receive, with a keyboard and printer, but no built-in paper tape reader or punch
* '''ASR'''&amp;nbsp;– Automatic Send and Receive, with a keyboard, printer, and built-in paper tape reader and punch

Not all models came in all three configurations. Teletype Corporation documents suffixed the configuration to the model number, e.g., "Model 33 ASR" (Model 33 Automatic Send and Receive).  In contrast, some customers and users tended to place the configuration before the model number, e.g., "ASR-33".

The U.S. military had their own system of identifying the various models, often identifying various improvements, included options / features, etc. The TT-47/UG was the first Model 28 KSR, and while Teletype's designation for the basic machine remained the same over the next 20+ years, the TT-47/UG took on suffixes to identify the specific version. The last TT-47/UG was the TT-47L/UG. The U.S. Navy also assigned some "set" designations using the [[Joint Electronics Type Designation System|standard Army/Navy system]], such as the AN/UGC-5, a Teletype Model 28 ASR which has a keyboard, printer, tape punch and reader facilities all in one cabinet.

* '''Model 29''' (1950s)
The '''Teletype Model 29''' is a six-bit machine using an IBM [[BCD (6-bit)|BCD]] code.&lt;ref name="chad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethw.org/First-Hand:Chad_is_Our_Most_Important_Product:_An_Engineer's_Memory_of_Teletype_Corporation|title=First-Hand:Chad is Our Most Important Product: An Engineer's Memory of Teletype Corporation|author=Jim Haynes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It began as a replacement for Model 20, but apparently there was no market for such a machine, so it was repurposed for IDP (Integrated Data Processing) use.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

* '''Model 31''' (1947)
The '''Teletype Model 31''' is a compact and light-weight five-level start-stop tape printer designed for mobile operation in the air and on the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TELETYPE MODEL 31 TAPE PRINTER|url=http://www.baudot.net/teletype/M31.htm|website=baudot.net|accessdate=2012-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teletype Model 31 Tape Printer, Bulletin 200, Issue 1, September 1947|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/teletype/200_Model31_Oct52.pdf|accessdate=2012-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Dataspeed systems (1962 and later)
'''Dataspeed''' was the Bell System name for a family of high speed paper tape systems used with DataPhone modems.  Type 1
was 5-level, 1050 wpm.  Type 2 was 5-8 level, 1050 wpm.  Type 4 was 8 level with automatic error detection and correction
by retransmitting blocks of data received in error.  Type 5 was 8 level 750 wpm using a modem that was very inexpensive
as a transmitter; hence the system was popular for data collection applications.

* '''Models 32/33''' (1963)
{{main|Teletype Model 33}}
The '''Teletype Model 32''' and '''Teletype Model 33''' are low-cost teleprinters, all-mechanical in design, with many plastic parts; both used a typewheel for printing. They were produced in ASR, KSR and RO versions and introduced as a commercial product in 1963&lt;ref&gt;"Auerbach Guide to Alphanumeric Display Terminals", Auerbach Publishers, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; after being originally designed for the US Navy.&lt;ref name="baudot.net"/&gt; The Model 33 is an [[ASCII]] [[teleprinter]] designed for light-duty office use. The Model 32 is a Baudot variant of the Model 33. Both were less rugged and less expensive than earlier Teletype machines.  The Model 33 ASR was ubiquitous as a [[System console|console device]], with its paper tape reader/punch used as an I/O device, in the early [[minicomputer]] era. Over 600,000 Model 32 and 33 machines were manufactured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.baudot.net/docs/slayton--tty-museum.pdf| title=History of Telegraphy from the Teletype Museum | website=baudot.net | accessdate=2012-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Model 35''' (1963)
The '''Teletype Model 35''' is a 110 [[baud]] terminal that utilizes a serial input / output eight-level 11 unit code signal consisting of a start bit, seven information bits, an even parity bit and two stop bits. The Model 35 was produced in ASR, KSR and RO versions. The Model 35 handles 1963 and USASI X3.4-1968 ASCII Code and prints 63 graphics of this code with letters in upper case on an 8.5 wide inch page using a typebox.  The Model 35 interface will accept DC current (20 ma or 60 ma). An optional modem interface provides for operation over voice-grade channels. The modem transmits asynchronously in serial format, compatible with Bell System [[Bell 101|101]], [[Bell 103 modem|103]] and 113 data sets or their equivalent.

The Teletype Model 35 ASR is 38.5 inches high, 40 inches wide and 24 inches deep. The Teletype Model 35 KSR and RO are 38.5 inches high, 24 inches wide and 24 inches deep. This machine uses a standard 115 VAC 60&amp;nbsp;Hz single phase synchronous motor. The recommended operating environment is a temperature of 40 to 110 Fahrenheit, a relative humidity of 2 to 95 percent and an altitude of 0 to 10,000 feet. Lubrication maintenance is recommended every 1500 hours of operation or every six months, whichever occurs first. The printing paper is an 8.44 inch by 4.5 inch diameter roll. Ribbons are 0.5 inch wide by 60 yards long, with plastic spools and eyelets for proper ribbon reverse operation.

Each [[1ESS switch]] included a retractable [[rack-mounted]] 35-type TTY and a duplicate remote TTY.&lt;ref&gt;

* '''Inktronic Terminal''' (1966)
The '''Teletype Inktronic Terminal''' is an electronic, high-speed teleprinter that uses electrostatic deflection to print characters at 1200 words-per-minute. The Inktronic terminal prints an 80 column page using forty jets to print 63 alphanumeric characters in two columns on an 8.5 inch roll of paper. The Inktronic terminal was produced in KSR and RO versions. The KSR version can generate 128 ASCII code combinations while the RO version was available as a Baudot or ASCII printer. An ASR version was planned but not produced. When the Inktronic terminal proved unreliable and difficult to maintain, it was withdrawn from production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacques-andre.fr/chi/chi90/tomash.html |title=Extrait de Deuxième Colloque sur l'Histoire de l'Informatique en France}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Teletype Model 37''' is a 150 [[baud]] terminal that utilizes a serial input / output 10 unit code signal consisting of a start bit, seven information bits, an even parity bit and a stop bit. The Model 37 was produced in ASR, KSR and RO versions. The Model 37 handles USASI X3.4-1968 ASCII Code and prints 94 graphics of this code with letters in both upper and lower case, with the option to print in two colors. The Model 37 uses a six-row removable typebox with provisions for 96 type pallet positions. When the Shift-Out feature is included, the six-row typebox is replaced with a seven-row typebox allowing 112 pallet positions, or it can be replaced with an eight-row typebox allowing 128 type pallet positions. The Model 37 interface meets the requirements of [[RS-232|EIA RS-232-B]]. The Model 37 has a recommended maintenance interval of every six months or every 1500 hours. The Model 37 is 36.25 inches high. The Model 37 ASR and KSR are 27.5 inches deep. The Model 37 RO is 24.25 inches deep. The Model 37 ASR weighs 340 pounds. The Model 37 KSR and RO weighs approximately 185 pounds.

* '''4100 Paper Tape Equipment''' (1972)
The '''4100 Paper Tape Equipment''' consists of the 4110 series of synchronous paper tape readers (CX), 4120 series of synchronous punches (BRPE), 4130 series of asynchronous readers (DX) and the 4140 series of asynchronous punches (DRPE).

The CX readers operate at 107 characters per second, with two fixed-level versions for reading either 6-level or 8-level fully punched or chadless paper tape, and an adjustable-level version for reading 5, 6, 7 or 8-level paper tape. All CX version readers were packaged for table-top use and have a parallel contact interface which is wired directly to the reader tape sensing contacts.

The BRPE tape punches operate at 110 characters per second, with two adjustable-level versions for reading either 5 or 8-level paper tape or 6, 7 or 8-level paper tape. A fixed-level 6-level paper tape punch was also available. All BRPE version paper tape punches were packaged for table-top use and have a parallel contact interface which is wired directly to the punch electromagnetic coils.

The DX paper tape readers operate at any speed up to 360 characters per second via external timing, except EIA. EIA tape readers operate at 120 characters per second if internal timing is used, and up to 314 characters per second if external timing is used. All of the DX paper tape readers are adjustable-level, reading 5, 6, 7 or 8-level fully punched or chadless paper tape. The DX series of paper tape readers were available in table-top and rack mount models, with an optional verifier data output for use by an external verifier logic to guarantee the accuracy of each character read.

The DRPE tape punches operate at any speed up to 240 characters per second with an adjustable-level version for reading 6, 7 or 8-level paper tape  and a fixed-level 6-level version. All DRPE version paper tape punches were packaged in table-top and rack-mount models, with an optional verifier logic which read each character immediately after it was punched, compared it to the character received and provided an error output pulse if they did not agree.

* '''Model 38''' (1972)
The '''Teletype Model 38''' is a 110 [[baud]] terminal that utilizes a serial input / output 11 unit code signal consisting of a start bit, seven information bits, an even parity bit and two stop bits. The Model 38 was produced in ASR, KSR and RO versions. The Model 38 handles USASI X3.4-1968 ASCII Code and prints 94 graphics of this code with letters in both upper and lower case, with the option to print in two colors on a pin-fed, 14-7/8 inch wide page. The Model 38 interface will accept either DC current (20 ma or 60 ma) or EIA RS-232-C. A built-in modem interface provides for operation over voice-grade channels. The modem transmits asynchronously in serial format, compatible with Bell System 101, 103, 108 and 113 data sets or their equivalent.

* '''Models 42/43''' (1977)
The '''Teletype Model 42''' and '''Teletype Model 43''' are electronic teleprinters providing character-at-a-time keyboard-printer send receive operation. The Teletype Model 42 is the Baudot variant of the Model 43, which is an ASCII teleprinter. The Model 43 has two transmission speeds, 100 words-per-minute and 300 words-per-minute, selectable by the operator to match the distant station speed. The Teletype Model 43 printer could print up to 80 characters per line using the friction feed printer option. Model 43 sprocket feed printers print messages with up to 132 characters per line using 12 inch wide sprocket feed paper. The tractor feed printer will print messages with up to 80 characters per line using 12 inch sprocket feed paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/teletype/ksr43.pdf|title=How to Operate the 43 teleprinter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Dataspeed 40''' (1979)
The '''Teletype Dataspeed 40''' combined electronic CRTs and high speed printer terminals and were networked in many different applications through the use of "cluster controllers" and digital data service units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/teletype/model_40/325-054_Synchronous_Dataspeed_40_4_Service_Mar79.pdf|title=dataspeed 40/4 Station Arrangements Service Manual}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dataspeed 40 interfaced a synchronous modem usually running at 2400, 4800 or 9600 baud. The trademarked term "Dataspeed" originated with a series of high speed paper tape terminals that sent and received oil-treated punched paper tape at 1050 words per minute. AT&amp;T used the Dataspeed 40 terminals internally for their [[Switching Control Center System]] and similar purposes. The Dataspeed 40 was also sold commercially and used for a variety of purposes and displaced some older and slower speed Teletype equipment.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; book by cognitive scientist and usability engineer [[Donald Norman]] about how design serves as the communication between object and user, and how to optimize that conduit of communication in order to make the experience of using the object pleasurable. One of the main premises of the book is that although people are often keen to blame themselves when objects appear to malfunction, it is not the fault of the user but rather the lack of intuitive guidance that should be present in the design.

The book was published in 1988 with the title '''''The Psychology of Everyday Things'''''. Norman said his academic peers liked that title, but believed the new title better conveyed the content of the book and better attracted interested readers.&lt;ref name="Preface2002"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ix}} It is often referred to by the initialisms '''''POET''''' and '''''DOET'''''.

Norman uses case studies to describe the psychology behind what he deems good and bad design, and proposes design principles. The book spans several disciplines including [[behavioral psychology]], [[ergonomics]], and design practice.

A major update of the book, '''''The Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded Edition''''', was published in 2013.

==Contents==

In the book, Norman introduced the term ''[[affordance]]'' as it applied to design,&lt;ref name="AboutFace3"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10,87–92}}

He also popularized the term ''[[user-centered design]]'', which he had previously referred to in ''User Centered System Design'' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used the term to describe design based on the needs of the user, leaving aside what he deemed secondary issues like [[aesthetics]]. User-centered design involves ''simplifying the structure of tasks'', ''making things visible'', ''getting the mapping right'', ''exploiting the powers of constraint'', ''designing for error'', ''explaining affordances'' and [[seven stages of action]]. He goes to great lengths to define and explain these terms in detail, giving examples following and going against the advice given and pointing out the consequences.

Other topics of the book include:

* The Psychopathology of Everyday Things
* The Psychology of Everyday Actions
* Knowledge in the Head and in the World
* Knowing What to Do
* To Err Is Human
* [[Human-centered design]]
* The Design Challenge

After a group of industrial designers felt affronted after reading an early draft, Norman rewrote the book to make it more sympathetic to the profession.&lt;ref name="Durham"/&gt;

The '''UCL Department of Science and Technology Studies (STS)''' is an academic department in [[University College London]], [[London]], England. It is part of UCL's Faculty of Mathematics and Physical Sciences. The department offers academic training at both undergraduate and graduate (MSc and MPhil/PhD) levels.

The department received its current name in 1994. It had been the "Department of History and Philosophy of Science" from 1938 to 1994, and the "Department of History and Method of Science" from 1921 to 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Smeaton, William A. "History of science at University College London: 1919–47", ''[[The British Journal for the History of Science]]'', 30: 25–28, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

University College London was the first UK university to offer single honours undergraduate degrees in this interdisciplinary subject, launching its BSc in history and philosophy of science in 1993. Two related BSc degrees followed shortly thereafter. At UCL, science and technology studies (abbreviated "STS") includes three specialist research clusters: "history of science," "philosophy of science," and "science, culture, and democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/research|title=STS Research|website=www.ucl.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wistarburg sign.jpg|thumb|Wistarburg Glass Works roadsign]]
The ''' Wistarburg Glass Works ''' (sometimes spelled '''Wistarburgh Glass Works'''; also known as the ''' United Glass Company''') was the first successful glass factory and  [[joint venture|joint-venture]] enterprise in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], referred to as Colonial America. [[Caspar Wistar (glassmaker)|Caspar Wistar]] founded the glass works company in 1739. He began by recruiting experienced glass artisans from Europe, and built homes for the workers along with a mansion for the factory's foreman. Wistar also had a [[company store]] built near the factory.

The village that developed around the factory adopted Wistar's name, and became known as Wistarburg. The village was in [[Salem County, New Jersey]], in the township of [[Alloway Township, New Jersey|Alloway]]. Wistar's factory produced thousands of glass bottles per year, as well as [[flat glass|window glass]]. Wistar was a friend of [[Benjamin Franklin]], and made glass globes for Franklin's electricity-producing machines used for scientific research. Wistar's son inherited the business and his son, Wistar's grandson, eventually gained control of the company, but owing to his mismanagement it closed.

==Company foundation==
[[Caspar Wistar (glassmaker)|Caspar Wistar]] (1696–1752) emigrated from the [[Palatinate (region)|Palitinate region of Germany]] to Philadelphia in 1717. There he began making brass buttons, which he would take with him on sales visits to [[Salem County, New Jersey]]. On one such trip he noticed that the township of [[Alloway Township, New Jersey|Alloway]] had an abundant supply of the necessary materials for glass manufacture&amp;nbsp;– white sand, clay, wood, and accessible waterways of the nearby [[Deep Run (Alloway Creek)|Deep Run]] and [[Alloway Creek]] rivers for transporting raw materials in and finished products out. He was thus encouraged to establish a glass factory there.&lt;ref name="Owen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historical-american-glass.com/wistarburgh-glass.html |first1=J. Victor |last1=Owen |publisher=Historical American Glass |title=The United Glass Company located at Wistarburg |access-date=January 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pierce|1960|page=97}} Wistar's was not the first to be built in colonial America. Earlier establishments had been setup at [[Jamestown, Virginia]], in 1607 and 1621. They were founded to export glass items to England, but ultimately failed, having produced little, if any, glass.&lt;ref name=JamestownGlassmaking&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/jame/learn/historyculture/glassmaking-at-jamestown.htm |title=Glassmaking at Jamestown |work=Historic Jamestowne |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |access-date=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wistar's button-making business proved to be a success, and together with his gains from speculating in land allowed him to accumulate sufficient capital to fund a new enterprise. He began his glass-making venture in 1737 by buying {{convert|2000|acres}} of land about {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} from [[Salem, New Jersey]],&lt;ref name=CreekLocation&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wheatonarts.org/7926-2/past-exhibitions/1987-to-1989-exhibitions/1989-the-wistars-and-their-glass-1739-1777/ |title=The Wistars and their Glass 1739–1777 / Factory Operations |date=2015 |website= |publisher=WheatonArts |access-date=July 22, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commenced construction of his factory&amp;nbsp;– which became the first commercially successful glass factory in America.{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=251}}{{sfn|Cantele|Kaplan|2010|page=275}} He arranged in January 1738 to lease {{convert|50|acres|ha}} of land containing {{convert|18000|cord}} of wood from John Ladd, a local landowner.{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=155}} Wistar then recruited four experienced glass makers from the Palitinate region of Germany&amp;nbsp;– C. Halter, S. Griessmeyer, J. Wentzel, and J. Halter&amp;nbsp;– to make the factory operational. He organized a joint venture with them, dividing profits in exchange for the art of glass making. The four artisans were to teach this art to the Wistars and nobody else in the colonies.&lt;ref name=Cradle&gt;{{cite news |last=Cunningham |first=John T. |date=July 2, 1964 |title=Cradle of American Glass |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17268234/|work=Bernardsville News |location= Bernardsville, New Jersey |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wistar had arranged for their journey to America, and they arrived in Philadelphia from [[Rotterdam]] on the ship ''Two Sisters'' in September 1738.{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=164-167}}{{efn|There are no historical records that tell whether the two Halters were related.&lt;ref name=related&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wheatonarts.org/7926-2/past-exhibitions/1987-to-1989-exhibitions/1989-the-wistars-and-their-glass-1739-1777/|title=The Wistars and their Glass 1739–1777 |date=2017 |publisher=Wheaton Arts and cultural center |access-date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wistar had houses built near the factory to rent for the key artisans and other workers that were usually [[Indentured servitude|indentured immigrants]].{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=169}} He also had a mansion constructed for the factory's foreman, which also served as a lodging and office for Wistar while on his visits to the factory from his home in Philadelphia. A [[company store]] was constructed for the workers' needs. Products could be purchased on credit against the glass a worker would make in the future; a bookkeeper was employed to keep track of the store accounts and housing rents. The store also served the people of the village of Alloway, and was the center of community life.{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=170}}

==Joint venture==
Wistar entered into a [[profit sharing|profit-sharing]] arrangement with the four German artisans who had helped to make his new factory operational. To ensure their continuing support he set up a [[joint venture]] between five members, the first cooperative manufacturing joint-venture business in America and the first long-term successful glasshouse. The 1739 company began trading as the United Glass Company, which consisted of three individual joint ventures. Wistar was the general manager and primary share holder, with a two-thirds majority ownership in each of the joint ventures.{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=165}} The four Germans held one-third ownership and shared the expenses, assets, and profits of the three individual joint ventures. The first entity under the umbrella enterprise was held between Wistar and Wentzel, the second between Wistar and C. Halter, and the third between Wistar, Griesmeyer and J. Halter. The joint venture arrangement remained in effect until Wistar's death in 1752.&lt;ref name="Owen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CMG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmog.org/artwork/bottle-seal-richard-wistar |title=Bottle with the Seal of Richard Wistar |publisher=Corning Museum of Glass |access-date=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GlassHouse&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peachridgeglass.com/2013/09/the-united-glass-company-located-at-wistarburgh/ |publisher=Peachridge Glass |title=The United Glass Company located at Wistarburg |date=September 24, 2013 |first2=Ferdinand, V, |last2=Meyer |first1=Stephen |last1=Atkinson |access-date=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HAG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historical-american-glass.com/wistarburgh-glass.html |title= The United Glass Company located at Wistarburgh|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017 |website=A History of  Early American made Glass |publisher=Historical American Glass |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Franklin machine globe.jpg|thumb|Glass globes for [[Franklin's electrostatic machine|Benjamin Franklin's electrostatic machines]] were made by Wistarburg Glass Works.{{sfn|Lemay|2014|page=65}}]]
Wistar's factory produced about 15,000 glass bottles per year made in the [[Waldglas]] style, which had been a way of making glass in Europe since the Middle Ages. It was an inexpensive traditional method whereby the main materials of wood ash and sand produced a greenish-yellow glass. The factory produced window glass and was the first American supplier for the thirteen colonies.{{sfn|Veit|2014|p=94}} The Glass House (as it was often called) also produced rum flasks and tableware.{{sfn|Time Inc|1955|p=58}} Wistar had unlimited access to white [[silica sand]], as well as other necessary materials, and the company's success was further aided by New Jersey's low taxation; Wistar was easily able to obtain more assets for the business.&lt;ref name=lowtaxes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=1 |title=Caspar Wistar established the first successful glass manufacturing business in North America |last1=Kummer|first1=Insa |date=2014 |website=Immigrant Entrepreneurship |publisher=[[German Historical Institute]] |access-date=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wistar lived in Philadelphia, and was aware that the British did not allow the manufacture of certain items that were in competition with those imported from Britain. He therefore downplayed the profits from his glass business, so as to avoid arousing the suspicions of the British. Wistar ran his business affairs from Philadelphia, spending little time in Alloway. He sold the manufactured glass products through his store in Philadelphia, the Wistarburg company store, and his son Richard's store in New York City.{{sfn|Veit|2014|p=100}}

Wistar was friends with [[Benjamin Franklin]] of Philadelphia and made glass globes for [[Franklin's electrostatic machine|Franklin's electricity producing machines]], used for scientific research into electricity.{{sfn|Lemay|2014|page=65}} Franklin built several of his machines, using the Wistarburg glass globes, for [[Cadwallader Colden]] and [[Lewis Evans (surveyor)|Lewis Evans]], for which they paid him between ten and twelve pounds each.{{sfn|Lemay|2014|page=75}} The Wistarburg Glass Works also made glass tubes for [[David Rittenhouse]] to use in his experiments on electricity.{{sfn|Davis|2012|p=27}}

Wistar died of [[dropsy]] in Philadelphia on March 21, 1752,{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=170}} and his son Richard took over the glass works. Richard also mostly ran the business from Philadelphia, but worked on increasing sales and expanding the company's product range. Just like his father, he relied on hired artisans to run the glass works factory in Alloway. The glass enterprise continued into the 1770s, but struggled owing to deforestation around Wistarburg. Wood from the trees was needed as fuel to run the glass furnaces, and when supplies began to run short some of the company's key artisans resigned and went to start their own glass company in [[Glassboro, New Jersey]], where there were new uncut forests and plenty of wood. Richard also had personal problems that occupied much of his time, and financial difficulties caused by the Revolutionary War; in an attempt to make ends meet, he sold a major portion of his father's New Jersey real estate.{{sfn|Veit|2014|p=100}} Richard died in 1781, and his son John took over the business. John failed to devote the effort necessary to run the glass works, allowing it to go into serious decline and ultimately it went out of business. The final year of the enterprise is disputed by scholars, but it is known that in 1793 the property that the factory was on was divided up among Richard's heirs and sold in parcels.{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=156}}
