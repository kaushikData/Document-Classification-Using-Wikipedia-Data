'''Abel''' (KT-12/H1)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Australopithecus bahrelghazali'': KT-12/H1|url=http://www.efossils.org/page/boneviewer/Australopithecus%20bahrelghazali/KT-12%5CH1|publisher=eFossils|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the name given to the only specimen ever discovered of ''[[Australopithecus bahrelghazali]]''.  Abel was found in January 1995 in [[Chad]] in the [[Kanem Region]] by the [[paleontologist]] [[Michel Brunet (paleontologist)|Michel Brunet]],&lt;ref&gt;Brunet, M., Beauvilain, A., Coppens, Y., Heintz, É., Moutaye, A.H.E et Pilbeam, D. (1995) - "The first australopithecine 2,500 kilometres west of the Rift Valley (Chad)", ''Nature'', 378, pp. 273-275.&lt;/ref&gt; who named the fossil "Abel" in memory of his close friend Abel Brillanceau, who had died of [[malaria]] in 1989.

Of Abel remains only part of a jaw, which explains the little information descernable concerning its way of life.

The few teeth confirm it to be of the genus ''[[Australopithecus]]'': it has a second [[premolar]] with a broad and molarized crown, not dissimilar to the [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]] fossil, and as such to the ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]''.{{cn|date=June 2012}}

The '''America First Committee''' ('''AFC''') was the foremost [[United States]] [[non-interventionist]] [[advocacy group|pressure group]] against the American entry into [[World War II]]. Started on September 4, 1940, it experienced mixed messaging with [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] rhetoric from leading members,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-america-first-20170120-story.html|title='America First,' a phrase with a loaded anti-Semitic and isolationist history|last=Bennett|first=Brian|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/trump-america-first/514037/|title=A Short History of 'America First'|last=Calamur|first=Krishnadev|date=2017-01-21|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ZUniR1uQcUC&amp;pg=PA66|title=1940: FDR, Willkie, Lindbergh, Hitler-the Election amid the Storm|last=Dunn|first=Susan|date=2013-06-04|publisher=Yale University Press|year=|isbn=0300195133|location=|pages=66|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was dissolved on December 10, 1941, three days after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] had brought the war to America.  Membership peaked at 800,000 paying members in 450 chapters.  It was one of the largest [[anti-war movement|anti-war]] organizations in [[History of the United States|American history]].&lt;ref name="Wayne S. Cole 1953"&gt;Wayne S.

The AFC was established on September 4, 1940, by Yale Law School student [[R. Douglas Stuart, Jr.]] (son of [[R. Douglas Stuart]], co-founder of [[Quaker Oats Company|Quaker Oats]]), along with other students, including future President [[Gerald Ford]], future [[Peace Corps]] director [[Sargent Shriver]], and future U.S. Supreme Court justice [[Potter Stewart]].&lt;ref name="KauffmanSarles2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kauffman|first1=Bill|last2=Sarles|first2=Ruth|authorlink2=Ruth Sarles|title=A story of America First: the men and women who opposed U.

Cole 1953"/&gt;

It claimed 135,000 members in 60 chapters in Illinois, its strongest state.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider p 198&lt;/ref&gt; Fundraising drives produced about $370,000 from some 25,000 contributors. Nearly half came from a few millionaires such as [[William H. Regnery]], H. Smith Richardson of the [[Vicks#History|Vick Chemical Company]], General [[Robert E. Wood]] of Sears-Roebuck,  publisher [[Joseph M. Patterson]] (New York ''Daily News'') and his cousin, publisher [[Robert R. McCormick]] (''[[Chicago Tribune]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Wayne S. (1953). ''[https://archive.org/stream/americafirsttheb000771mbp#page/n32/mode/1up America First: The Battle Against Intervention]''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AFC was never able to get funding for its own public opinion poll. The New York chapter received slightly more than $190,000, most of it from its 47,000 contributors. Since it never had a national membership form or national dues, and local chapters were quite autonomous. Historians point out that the organization's leaders had no idea how many "members" it had.&lt;ref&gt;Cole 1953, 25-33; Schneider 201-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious organizing of the America First Committee took place in [[Chicago]] not long after the September 1940 establishment. Chicago was to remain the national headquarters of the committee. To preside over their committee, America First chose General [[Robert E. Wood]], the 61-year-old chairman of [[Sears, Roebuck and Co.]] Wood remained at the head of the committee until it was disbanded in the days after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The America First Committee had its share of prominent businessmen as well as the sympathies of political figures including Democratic Senators [[Burton K. Wheeler]] of Montana and [[David I. Walsh]] of Massachusetts, Republican Senator [[Gerald P. Nye]] of North Dakota, with its most prominent spokesman being aviator [[Charles A. Lindbergh]].  Other celebrities supporting America First were actress [[Lillian Gish]] and architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Starr|title=Embattled Dreams: California in War and Peace, 1940-1950|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PKL4DQ4XLtUC&amp;pg=PA6|year=2003|publisher=Oxford UP|page=6|isbn=9780195168976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two men who would later become presidents, [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Gerald Ford]], supported and contributed to the organization. When he donated $100 to the AFC, Kennedy attached a note which read simply: "What you are doing is vital."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/still-america-first/|title=Still America First|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford was one of the first members of the AFC when a chapter formed at Yale University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/articles/621645/defense-america-first|title=In defense of America First|date=2 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Potter Stewart]], a future Supreme Court justice served on the original committee of the AFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/05/america-first-was-not-a-pro-nazi-organisation|title=America First was not a pro-Nazi organisation - Letters|first=|last=Letters|date=5 March 2017|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:America First Rally flyer April 4 1941.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Flyer for an America First Committee rally in St. Louis, Missouri in April 1941]]
When the war began in September 1939, most Americans, including politicians, demanded neutrality regarding Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leroy N. Rieselbach|title=The Roots of Isolationism: congressional voting and presidential leadership in foreign policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jUR3AAAAMAAJ|year=1966|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most Americans supported strong measures against Japan, Europe was the focus of the America First Committee. The public mood was changing, however, especially after the [[fall of France]] in the spring of 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Gilbert Ryan|author2=Leonard C. Schlup|title=Historical Dictionary of the 1940s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-t3Hx4ASLKUC&amp;pg=PA415|year=2006|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|page=415|isbn=9780765621078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The America First Committee launched a petition aimed at enforcing the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s#Neutrality Act of 1939|1939 Neutrality Act]] and forcing President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to keep his pledge to keep America out of the war. They profoundly distrusted Roosevelt and argued that he was lying to the American people.

On the day after Roosevelt's [[Lend-Lease|lend-lease]] bill was submitted to the [[United States Congress]], Wood promised AFC opposition "with all the vigor it can exert". America First staunchly opposed the convoying of ships, the [[Atlantic Charter]], and the placing of economic pressure on Japan. In order to achieve the defeat of lend-lease and the perpetuation of American neutrality, the AFC advocated four basic principles:

* The United States must build an impregnable defense for America.
* No foreign power, nor group of powers, can successfully attack a prepared America.
* American democracy can be preserved only by keeping out of the European war.
* "Aid short of war" weakens national defense at home and threatens to involve America in war abroad.

[[File:Amrally.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Charles Lindbergh speaking at an America First Committee rally in Fort Wayne, Indiana in early October 1941]]

[[Charles Lindbergh]] was admired in Germany and allowed to see the buildup of the German air force, the [[Luftwaffe]], in 1937. He was impressed by its strength and secretly reported his findings to the General Staff of the [[United States Army]], warning them that the U.S. had fallen behind and that it must urgently build up its aviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Duffy|title=Lindbergh vs. Roosevelt: The Rivalry That Divided America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAiVCRELHsQC&amp;pg=PA76|year=2010|publisher=Regnery|pages=76–77|isbn=9781596981676}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had feuded with the Roosevelt administration for years.  His first radio speech was broadcast on September 15, 1939, on all three of the major radio networks. He urged listeners to look beyond the speeches and propaganda that they were being fed and instead look at who was writing the speeches and reports, who owned the papers and who influenced the speakers.

On June 20, 1941, Lindbergh spoke to 30,000 people in Los Angeles and billed it as a "Peace and Preparedness Mass Meeting", Lindbergh criticized those movements which he perceived were leading America into the war. He proclaimed that the United States was in a position that made it virtually impregnable. He claimed that the interventionists and the British who called for  "the defense of England" really meant "the defeat of Germany".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Pizzitola|title=Hearst Over Hollywood: Power, Passion, and Propaganda in the Movies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KW7ago9Wo3MC&amp;pg=PA401|year=2002|publisher=Columbia UP|page=401|isbn=9780231116466}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wayne S.

Nothing did more to escalate the tensions than the speech which Lindbergh delivered to a rally in [[Des Moines, Iowa]] on September 11, 1941. In that speech, he identified the forces pulling America into the war as the British, the Roosevelt administration, and [[American Jews]]. While he expressed sympathy for the plight of the Jews in Germany, he argued that America's entry into the war would serve them little better. He said in part:

{{quote|It is not difficult to understand why Jewish people desire the overthrow of Nazi Germany. The persecution they suffered in Germany would be sufficient to make bitter enemies of any race. No person with a sense of the dignity of mankind can condone the persecution the Jewish race suffered in Germany. But no person of honesty and vision can look on their pro-war policy here today without seeing the dangers involved in such a policy, both for us and for them.

Instead of agitating for war the Jewish groups in this country should be opposing it in every possible way, for they will be among the first to feel its consequences. Tolerance is a virtue that depends upon peace and strength. History shows that it cannot survive war and devastation. A few farsighted Jewish people realize this and stand opposed to intervention. But the majority still do not. Their greatest danger to this country lies in their large ownership and influence in our motion pictures, our press, our radio, and our government.&lt;ref&gt;Cole 1953, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Dr_Seuss_and_the_wolf_chewed_up_the_children.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A Dr. Seuss editorial cartoon from early October 1941 criticizing America First]]

After the attack on Pearl Harbor, AFC canceled a rally with Lindbergh at [[Boston Garden]] "in view of recent critical developments",&lt;ref name="nyt19411209"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1941/12/09/105168767.html?smid=tw-nytarchives&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;pageNumber=40 |title=No America First Rally |date=1941-12-09 |newspaper=The New York Times |agency=Associated Press |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the organization's leaders announced their support of the war effort. Lindbergh said:&lt;ref name="nytafc19411209"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1941/12/09/105168813.html?smid=tw-nytarchives&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;pageNumber=44 |title=Isolationist Groups Back Roosevelt |date=1941-12-09 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We have been stepping closer to war for many months. Now it has come and we must meet it as united Americans regardless of our attitude in the past toward the policy our government has followed.

Whether or not that policy has been wise, our country has been attacked by force of arms and by force of arms we must retaliate. Our own defenses and our own military position have already been neglected too long. We must now turn every effort to building the greatest and most efficient Army, Navy and Air Force in the world. When American soldiers go to war it must be with the best equipment that modern skill can design and that modern industry can build.}}

With the formal declaration of war against Japan, the organization chose to disband. On December 11, the committee leaders met and voted for dissolution. In the statement which they released to the press was the following:

{{quote|Our principles were right. Had they been followed, war could have been avoided. No good purpose can now be served by considering what might have been, had our objectives been attained.

We are at war. Today, though there may be many important subsidiary considerations, the primary objective is not difficult to state. It can be completely defined in one word: Victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hFxFAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ELwMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3259%2C4276685 | title=America First Group to Quit | work=The Telegraph-Herald | date=1941-12-12 | agency=United Press International | accessdate=November 16, 2011 | location=Dubuque, Iowa | pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Conservative commentator [[Pat Buchanan]] has praised America First and used its name as a slogan. "The achievements of that organization are monumental," writes Buchanan. "By keeping America out of World War II until Hitler attacked Stalin in June 1941, Soviet Russia, not America, bore the brunt of the fighting, bleeding and dying to defeat Nazi Germany."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pat Buchanan|title=The Resurrection of 'America First!'|url=http://www.theamericancause.org/patamericafirst.htm|publisher=The American Cause|date=October 13, 2004|accessdate=2008-02-03|postscript={{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Antarctica Marathon''' may have been the first for-profit sporting event held in [[Antarctica]], on January 28, 1995. The event is now held every year in late February or early March. The {{convert|42.195|km|mi|adj=on}} race is held on [[King George Island (Antarctica)|King George Island]], one of the largest Antarctic Islands just off the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. There is also a [[half-marathon]] held at the same time. The start and finish is at [[Bellingshausen Station]] (the Russian base), and the course passes the [[Artigas Base]] (Uruguayan), the [[Base Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva|Frei Base]] (Chilean) and the [[Antarctic Great Wall Station|Great Wall Base]] (Chinese). The course follows a gravel road that connects the bases.

The first marathon held in Antarctica may have been near the American research base, McMurdo Station, in January 1995.&lt;ref name="usap.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contenthandler.cfm?id=4125|title=The Antarctic Sun: News about Antarctica - Running Down a Dream (page 1)|work=usap.gov|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual marathon is free and is open to employees and grantees of the [[United States Antarctic Program]], United States Air Force personnel on duty at McMurdo Station, as well as Kiwis from New Zealand's nearby research station, [[Scott Base]]. Many participants run the full marathon. However, a half marathon option is available. Some participants elect to ski the course. In January 2015, McMurdo Station hosted possibly the first known Ultra Marathon over 30 miles&lt;ref name="southpolestation.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southpolestation.com/trivia/00s/marathon.html|title=The First South Pole Marathon|work=southpolestation.com|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the continent.&lt;ref name="usap.gov"/&gt;

The South Pole has also witnessed runners braving conditions to complete a full 26.2 mile race.&lt;ref name="southpolestation.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/sports/30antarctica.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; Both for-profit and free events have been held outside the [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]]. The South Pole is possibly the first known location of an Ultra&lt;ref&gt;[[Ultramarathon]]&lt;/ref&gt; Marathon on the continent, when defining an Ultra as anything over 26.2 miles.

'''Banū al-Akhdari''' (in [[Arabic]] : بنو الأخضري / banū al-Akẖḍarī, "the Lakhdari Clan") are a [[Sharif|Shereefian]] [[Arab]] [[tribe]] from [[Hejaz|Western Arabia]]. They immigrated during the advent of Islam to [[Yemen]] and the region of [[Rub' al Khali]] and [[Hadhramaut]] and then to the [[Maghreb]] more precisely in [[Algeria]] with the [[Maqil|Banu Maqil]] tribe from the 7th century. Their descendants bear the surnames "Lakhdari, al-Akhdari and el-Akhdari", they are cousins with the [[Banu Hashim]] tribe, [[Banu Kinanah]] tribe and the [[Senussi|Banu al-Senussi]] [[tribe]] and members of the [[Quraysh]] branch.

They are the direct descendants of their common ancestors [[Hashim ibn Abd Manaf|'Amr Hashim Ibn' Abd Manaf]] (in [[Arabic]] : عامر هاشم بن عبد مناف) who was the great-grandfather of the [[Prophet]] of Islam [[Muhammad]].

[[File:Virgendecandelariacamarin01.jpg|thumb|150px|Image of the [[Virgin of Candelaria]] (Patron of Canary Islands) in the [[Basilica of Candelaria]] ([[Tenerife]]).]]
'''Chaxiraxi''' is a [[goddess]], known as the [[Sun]] Mother, in the religion of the [[indigenous people|aboriginal]] [[Guanches|Guanche]] inhabitants of the [[Canary Islands]]. Chaxiraxi was one of the principal goddesses of the Guanche [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. She was associated with the star [[Canopus]].

As natives of the Canary Islands are believed to have originally been pre-civilization [[Berbers]], it is conjectured that Chaxiraxi may have been adapted from the [[Punics|Punic]]-Berber goddess [[Tanit]], and given a different name and set of attributes. She is also associated with the alleged appearance c. 1392, 1400 or 1401 of the [[Virgin of Candelaria]] on [[Güímar]], on the island of [[Tenerife]], carrying her infant, [[Chijoraji]].

== Present-day worship ==
Chaxiraxi is considered the main goddess of the [[neo-pagan]] religion the [[Church of the Guanche People]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1902">The '''cinema of Namibia''' refers to cinema in the country of [[Namibia]], which claimed independence from [[South Africa]] in 1990.

Before independence, American anthropologist [[John Marshall (filmmaker)|John Marshall]] made ethnographic films of the [[Ju/'hoansi]] for over four decades from 1950 onwards, resulting in documentary films such as ''[[The Hunters (1957 film)|The Hunters]]'' (1957) and ''[[Nǃai, the Story of a ǃKung Woman]]'' (1980).&lt;ref name=remembering&gt;Apley, Alice and David Tamés.

After independence, Namibian filmmakers have started to assert their own identity. Pioneers included [[Bridget Pickering]], [[Richard Pakleppa]] and [[Cecil Moller]]. They have been joined by a younger generation including [[Joel Haikali]], [[Oshosheni Hiveluah]], [[Perivi Katjavivi]], [[Tim Huebschle]],&lt;ref name="SaralaHelen2018"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahnke|first=Hans-Christian|editor=Krishnamurthy, Sarala; Vale, Helen|title=Writing Namibia: Literature in Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=okZbDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211|year=2018|publisher=University of Namibia Press|isbn=978-99916-42-33-8|page=211|chapter=Reading Namibian film}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Krischka Stoffels]].&lt;ref name="NelmesSelbo2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jule Selbo|editor=Jill Nelmes; Jule Selbo|title=Women Screenwriters: An International Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kGikCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA29|year=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-137-31237-2|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Namibian government passed the [[Namibian Film Commission Act]] to promote filmmaking in the country.&lt;ref name="NelmesSelbo2015"/&gt;

"'''Coming Home'''" ({{lang-is|"'''Aftur heim'''"}}) is the Icelandic entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011]]. It was performed by the tribute band '''[[Sjonni's Friends]]''' (in Icelandic '''Vinir Sjonna'''), made up of musicians Hreimur Örn Heimisson, Gunnar Ólason, Benedikt Brynleifsson, Vignir Snær Vigfússon, Matthías Matthíasson and Pálmi Sigurhjartarson, all of whom had worked with Sjonni.

The original singer, [[Sjonni Brink]] or just Sjonni (real name Sigurjón Brink) died days before the Icelandic national selection for the contest, after which his musician friends decided to form Sjonni's Friends (sometimes also known as Sigurjón's Friends) and perform the song as a tribute. It finished in 20th place in the finals with 61 points.

Brass was recorded in New York by Grammy award participant Danny Flam (of [[Kanye West]]'s "All of the lights" fame) and Ron Bertolet.

      <comment>The mention of religion (Hindu and Sikh) from the Pakistan has been removed since the source makes no mention of this - it seems it was placed in by an Indian bigot. Furthermore the text now clarifies that it is a claim by the Indian minister, and is not an officially confirmed fact from the Pakistani authorities.</comment>

The '''[[Custodian of Enemy Property]] for India''' is an [[India]]n government department that is empowered to appropriate property in India owned by [[Pakistan]]i nationals. After the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], the Enemy Property Act was promulgated in 1968. The act authorised the Central [[Government of India]] to appoint a custodian for enemy property for India and one or more deputy/assistant custodians as assistances. There is also a provision which validates the appointments made under the Defence of India Rules 1962 and 1971. The Pakistani nationals in question were citizens of undivided India before the Partition of India in 1947 took place, and left India to settle down in Pakistan.

Under the notification issued on 10 September and 11 September 1965, the central Government vested the following property in India belonging to, held by, or managed on behalf of Pakistani nationals; entrusting the property and its appurtenances in the hands of the custodian with immediate effect. This includes all immovable property, all lockers and [[safe deposit]]s; and all negotiable instruments such as promissory notes, shares, debentures and other Commerce.

Citizens of India are banned from entering any transactions by way of granting development rights, selling, transferring or [[Mortgage law|mortgaging]] more than a third of a property{{Clarify|date=June 2010}} in India declared as "enemy" Property. The office of the Custodian are located in [[Bombay]] with a branch in [[Calcutta]].

==Income==
The fees equal two percent on the gross income from the properties vested in the Custodian. The income received by way of rent, interest etc. on securities is invested in the [[Reserve Bank of India]]. The maturity for the year 2004-2005 is expected to touch 135 crores. A balance of 0.22 crores is in the personal ledger account of the Custodian maintained by the [[Central Bank of India]]. A sum of 51 lakhs (5.1 million) is kept in the fixed deposit in the name of Habib Bank.

==Property disposal==
In December 2017, [[Minister of Home Affairs (India)|India's Minister of Home Affairs]] [[Rajnath Singh]] granted the approval as per the amended "Enemy Property Act, 2017" to dispose off the properties free from the legal hurdles. 6,229 properties vested with the custodian have been already surveyed, remaining 2,999 vested with the custodian will be surveyed soon. There are 5,863 more properties in the process of vesting with the custodian will also be surveyed. Pakistan has already disposed of previously Indian-owned properties in Pakistan, according to Rajnath Singh.&lt;ref name=cleanup1&gt;[https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/govt-plans-to-dispose-off-enemy-properties-soon/articleshow/62123239.cms Govt plans to dispose off 'enemy' properties soon], [[The Economic Times|Economic Times]], 19 Dec 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Network of Information Centres''' ('''ENIC''') were established as a join initiative of [[UNESCO]] and the [[Council of Europe]]. They are intended to implement the [[Lisbon recognition convention]] and, in general, to develop policy and practice for the recognition of qualifications. The ENIC network works closely with the [[National Academic Recognition Information Centre|NARIC]] network of the [[European Union]].

The network is made up of national information centres from each of the member states of the European Cultural Convention. Each centre is set of independently by each nation and they therefore vary in size and scope. However they generally provide information on:

*the recognition of foreign qualifications of all kinds
*foreign education systems and the local education system
*opportunities for studying abroad i.e. financial questions, equivalences etc.

The prototype was delivered to the TSK on January 11, 2013 in [[Ankara]]. AZMİM will be operated to move earth, clear terrain obstacles, cut steep slopes and stabilize stream banks for easy river crossing of combat vehicles during [[Turkish Army]]'s [[amphibious warfare]].&lt;ref name="h"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/ekonomi/22339848.asp |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] Ekonomi |title=Türk ordusuna yüzer dozer geliyor |date=2013-01-11  |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contract to develop the armoured amphibious bulldozer was signed on March 10, 2009 between the [[Ministry of National Defence (Turkey)|Ministry of National Defence]] and the FNSS. The project, which began to develop on June 15, 2009, foresees the production of twelve units until the end of 2013.&lt;ref name="h"/&gt; The first was delivered on January 11, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armyrecognition.com/january_2013_army_military_defense_industry_news/fnss_has_delivered_the_azmim_aace_amphibious_armoured_earthmover_to_turksih_army_1401133.html AZMIM AACE Amphibious Armoured Earthmover delivered to Turkish Army] - Armyrecognition.com, January 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
AZMİM has two crew, one operator and one attendant. It is capable of shoveling, smoothing, hauling and excavating. Tests showed that it is resistant to [[land mine]]s and [[armour-piercing shot and shell]]. AZMİM is equipped with daylight camera system, [[night vision device]], multi-purpose [[LED display]] and air conditioner. The tracked vehicle can accompany other military combat vehicles without the need of a carrier thanks to its max. speed of {{convert|45|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Two installed [[pump-jet]]s enable the amphibious bulldozer to conduct a 360 degrees turning movement in rip current waters.&lt;ref name="h"/&gt;

'''Forogj, világ!''' ([[English language|English]] translation: "Spin, World!") was the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005]], performed in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] by [[Nox (band)|NOX]].
The song is [[folk music|folk]]-inspired, in which the singer asks the world to continue spinning in order that she may discover more about herself. She sings "I want to be somewhere else for a long time", implying that she is impatient for the world to spin in order to leave her old life behind.

The Eurovision performance featured Hungarian folk dancers, reminiscent of [[Ruslana]]'s energetic performance of "[[Wild Dances (song)|Wild Dances]]" at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004 Contest]], as well as of [[Riverdance]] (itself a former Contest interval act). At the opening, Tamás Nagy was eventually joined by four others who provided vocal support for lead singer Szilvia Péter Szabó, who wore a revealing black costume and performed a simplified version of the dance routine during the chorus.

As Hungary had not taken part in the Contest since [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]], the song was initially performed in the semi-final of the Contest. Here, it was performed fifteenth (following [[Romania]]'s [[Luminiţa Anghel]] &amp; [[Sistem]] with "[[Let Me Try (Luminiţa Anghel and Sistem song)|Let Me Try]]" and preceding [[Finland]]'s [[Geir Rönning]] with "[[Why? (Eurovision song)|Why]]"). In the semi-final voting, it received 167 points, and placed 5th in the 25-strong field; high enough to qualify for the final.

In the final, it was performed first (preceding the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Javine Hylton|Javine]] with [[Touch My Fire]]). At the close of voting, it had received 97 points, placing 12th in a field of 24 despite strong early results.  This result would have relegated Hungary to the semi-final had they competed in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006 Contest]].

The following year, in 2006 an English version was recorded, entitled "Spin, World". Just like the previous Hungarian entry ([[A holnap már nem lesz szomorú]]), the title was taken from the direct English translation of the Hungarian title, even though the exact title does not appear in the English version.

It was succeeded as the [[Hungary in the Eurovision Song Contest|Hungarian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007|2007 Contest]] by [[Magdi Rúzsa]] with [[Unsubstantial Blues]].

'''Headend in the Sky''' ('''HITS''') is [[Comcast|Comcast's]] satellite [[multiplex (TV)|multiplex]] service that provides cable channels to [[cable television]] operations.

At a traditional [[cable television headend]], multitudes of [[satellite dish]]es and [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]s are used to grab cable stations from dozens of [[communication satellite]]s.  In contrast, HITS combines cable stations into [[multiplex (TV)|multiplex]] signals on just a few satellites; cable television companies can then pull in hundreds of channels at the local headend with relatively little equipment; the HITS feed effectively replaces the more complex traditional headend operations.

HITS was founded in 1994 and its namesake product is commonly recognized as the pioneer of [[digital television]] in the United States.  HITS was launched by [[Tele-Communications Inc.|TCI]] before their later 1999 purchase by the [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph|old AT&amp;T]], then merged with the smaller [[Comcast]] in 2002 as part their purchase of [[AT&amp;T Broadband]] (formerly TCI).  The HITS headquarters in [[Centennial, Colorado]], formerly known as the National Digital Television Center, is now called the Comcast Media Center.

As of 2010, HITS offers 6 standard-definition [[multiplex (TV)|multiplexes]] on [[SES Americom|SES Americom's]] SES-1, 12 standard-definition multiplexes and 8 [[High-definition television|HD]] multiplexes on [[AMC-18]], 1 standard-definition multiplex on AMC-10, and 1 standard definition multiplex on [[Intelsat]]'s Galaxy 17. As of 2010, HITS delivers more than 280 digitally compressed video and audio television programming signals to more than 2000 cable operation sites across the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comcastmediacenter.com/company/] About Comcast Media Center&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
HITS offers the following services:
* HITS Quantum, which expands the legacy HITS channel lineup for digital systems, packaging in additional [[High-definition television|HDTV]] channels and introducing several advanced services such as [[video on demand]] and other [[interactive television|interactive]] applications.
* HITS Quick Take+, which provides an even lower-cost but still digital service for small cable systems.
* VOD In a Box, which provides a low-cost, remote, access to a video on demand library operated by Comcast.
* HITS AxIS, which provides a solution to launching [[EBIF]] and/or [[tru2way]] based applications on set-top boxes.
* HITS Broadband, which provides hardware solutions for starting broadband operations.

On January 30, 2007, HITS introduced HITS Quantum, which was launched later in the year.  HITS also announced the shutdown of its older HITS2Home service which allowed small cable companies to provide customers with digital service through satellite dishes at each home because they needed to move their signals off of the Ku satellite band to the C satellite band because too many cable operators were complaining about rain fade and providing the HITS2Home customers with the larger dishes for C band was impractical.

As of January 1, 2011 HITS2Home service became available to home users via two third party vendors. The home user is responsible for obtaining and maintaining their own C Band satellite dish and Motorola DSR-410 satellite receiver.

The '''Höganäs Formation''' is a [[Mesozoic]] geologic [[Formation (geology)|formation]] in [[Skåne]], [[Sweden]]. [[Dinosaur]] remains are among the fossils that have been recovered from the formation, although none have yet been referred to a specific [[genus]].&lt;ref name="dinosaurdistribution"&gt;Weishampel, et al. (2004). "Dinosaur distribution." Pp. 517-607.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discoveries==
Tracks discovered in the Höganäs Formation have been assigned to the ichnogenus ''Grallator (Eubrontes) cf. giganteus'', which were discovered in Rhaetian strata, and ''Grallator (Eubrontes) soltykovensis'', which were discovered in Hettangian strata.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gierliński | first1 = G. | last2 = Ahlberg | first2 = A. | doi = 10.1080/10420949409386377 | title = Late triassic and early jurassic dinosaur footprints in the höganäs formation of southern Sweden | journal = Ichnos | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 99 | year = 1994 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few of the tracks were taken to museums, but most of them disappeared in natural floodings.&lt;ref&gt;http://kentlundgren.blogspot.se/2012/03/kontakt-med-trias-och-jura.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Gierlinski and Ahlberg assigned these tracks from the [[Hoganas Formation]] of Sweden to ''Dilophosaurus'' as well.&lt;ref&gt;Glut, D.

==History==
The IONS a regional forum of Indian Ocean littoral states, represented by their Navy chiefs, was initiated and launched by [[India]] in February 2008&lt;ref&gt;http://defencereporter.com/navy/india-china-to-join-indian-ocean-exercise_92146.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cna.org/cna_files/pdf/DRM-2016-U-013939-Final2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://lkyspp2.nus.edu.sg/cag/publication/china-india-brief/china-india-brief-99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;journals.christuniversity.in/index.php/artha/article/download/1569/1314&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role ==
IONS is a security construct for the [[Indian Ocean|Indian Ocean region]] which is similar to the [[Western Pacific Naval Symposium]]. It is a voluntary initiative among the navies and maritime security agencies of the member nations. In addition to the symposiums, numerous other activities like workshops, essay competitions and lectures are also held under the umbrella of the organization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Members and observers ==
The 35 member nations of the IONS are grouped into four sub-regions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ions.global/ions-working-groups|title=IONS Working Groups {{!}} Indian Ocean Naval Symposium|website=www.ions.global|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/2017/11/27/president-inaugurates-naval-exercise/|title=President inaugurates 32-nation naval exercise {{!}} Dhaka Tribune|website=www.dhakatribune.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Coalition for Trachoma Control (ICTC)''' is a non-profit organization that was established in 2004 for the purpose of contributing to the global effort to eliminate blinding [[trachoma]] and to advocate and implement the SAFE strategy.  The SAFE strategy is endorsed by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs382/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICTC website has maps that show where SAFE—Surgery, Antibiotics, Facial cleanliness and Environmental improvement—is being implemented. The maps are free to use and download.

The ICTC currently has about 20 members who are engaged in the effort to eliminate blinding trachoma by 2020. There are also a number of observer organizations, such as The [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], [[USAID]], the US Fund for UNICEF, and the World Health Organization.

'''Global Strategic Plan 2020 INSight: The end in sight'''

The ICTC's INSight global strategic plan lays out the current trachoma situation, and what needs to be done to achieve elimination of blinding trachoma by 2020.

'''What is Trachoma?'''

[[Trachoma]] is caused by the bacterium [[Chlamydia trachomatis]], which spreads through contact with an infected person. Untreated, repeated trachoma infections make the eyelashes turn inward, scratching the cornea. This causes excruciating pain. Although children are the most susceptible to infection, the effects are often not felt until adulthood. Women, traditionally the caretakers of the home, are twice as likely as men to have the advanced stage of the disease, called [[trichiasis]].

An estimate 320 million people, mostly women and children, live in areas where they can be exposed to trachoma, a neglected tropical disease.&lt;ref&gt;2020 INSight: The end in sight. http://trachoma.org/global-strategy-2020-INSight&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]] (EU) consists of 28 member states. Each member state is party to the [[Treaties of the European Union|founding treaties]] of the union and thereby subject to the privileges and obligations of membership. Unlike members of most [[Intergovernmental organization|international organisations]], the member states of the EU are subjected to binding laws in exchange for representation within the common legislative and judicial institutions. Member states must agree unanimously for the EU to adopt policies concerning defence and [[foreign policy]].&lt;ref&gt;EU foreign policy is agreed case by case where every member state agrees to a common position. Thus a member state can veto a foreign policy it does not agree with and agreed policy tends to be lose and infrequent.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Subsidiarity]] is a founding principle of the EU.

In 1957, [[Inner Six|six core states]] founded the EU's predecessor, the [[European Economic Community]] ([[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[West Germany]]). The remaining states have acceded in subsequent [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargements]]. On 1 July 2013, [[Croatia]] became the newest member state of the EU. To accede, a state must fulfill the economic and political requirements known as the [[Copenhagen criteria]], which require a candidate to have a democratic, [[free market|free-market]] government together with the corresponding freedoms and institutions, and respect for the [[rule of law]]. Enlargement of the Union is also contingent upon the consent of all existing members and the candidate's adoption of the existing body of EU law, known as the [[acquis communautaire]].

There is disparity in the size, wealth and political system of member states, but all have ''de jure'' equal rights.  In practice, certain states are considerably more attractive than others. While in some areas majority voting takes place where larger states have more votes than smaller ones, smaller states have disproportional representation compared to their population. No member state has withdrawn or been suspended from the EU, though some dependent territories or semi-autonomous areas have left. In June 2016, the United Kingdom held a [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum on membership of the EU]], resulting in 51.89% of votes cast, being in favour of leaving. Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|invoked Article 50]] on 29 March 2017 to formally initiate the withdrawal process.&lt;ref name=GuardianMay/&gt;

==Enlargement==
{{Main|Enlargement of the European Union|Future enlargement of the European Union}}
[[File:EC-EU-enlargement animation.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|The continental territories of the member states of the European Union (European Communities pre-1993), animated in order of accession.]]

According to the [[Copenhagen criteria]], membership of the European Union is open to any European country that is a stable, [[free market|free-market]] [[liberal democracy]] that respects the [[rule of law]] and human rights. Furthermore, it has to be willing to accept all the obligations of membership, such as adopting all previously agreed law (the 170,000 pages of [[acquis communautaire]]) and switching to the [[euro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accession criteria |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/enlargement_process/accession_process/criteria/index_en.htm |accessdate=25 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209003613/http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/enlargement_process/accession_process/criteria/index_en.htm |archivedate=9 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; To join the European Union, it is required for all member states to agree; if a single member state disagrees, the applying country is declined accession to the European Union.  In addition to enlargement by adding new countries, the EU can also expand by having territories of member states, which are outside the EU, integrate more closely (for example in respect to the [[dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles]]) or by a territory of a member state which had previously seceded and then rejoined (see withdrawal below).

Enlargement is, and has been, a principal feature of the Union's political landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=European Commission |title=EU by topic: Enlargement |date=18 January 2016 |url=http://europa.eu/pol/enlarg/index_en.htm |accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU's predecessors were founded by the "[[Inner Six]]", those countries willing to forge ahead with the Community while others remained skeptical. It was only a decade before the first countries changed their policy and attempted to join the Union, which led to the first skepticism of enlargement. [[French President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]] feared British membership would be an American [[Trojan horse]] and vetoed its application. It was only after de Gaulle left office and a 12-hour talk by British Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] and French President [[Georges Pompidou]] took place that the United Kingdom's third application succeeded in 1970.&lt;ref name="bbc2002"&gt;{{cite news |title=Britain shut out|publisher=BBC News |year=2002|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/uk/2001/uk_and_europe/1958_1969.stm|accessdate=25 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/#title |title=1971 Year in Review |agency=United Press International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gYCuqxqS?url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/ |archivedate=5 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/uk/2001/uk_and_europe/1970_1979.stm|title=Ever closer union: joining the Community|work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 1990 saw the Cold War drawing to a close, and [[East Germany]] was welcomed into the Community as part of a reunited Germany. Shortly after, the previously neutral countries of Austria, Finland and Sweden acceded to the new European Union,&lt;ref name="eurac history"/&gt; though [[Switzerland]], which applied in 1992, froze its application due to opposition from voters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=British [[Diplomatic mission|Embassy]], [[Bern]] |title=EU and Switzerland |date=4 July 2006 |work=The UK &amp; Switzerland |url=http://www.britishembassy.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1085326325096 |accessdate=4 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428003205/http://www.britishembassy.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket%2FXcelerate%2FShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1085326325096 |archivedate=28 April 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Norway, which had applied once more, had its voters reject membership again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=European Commission |title=The History of the European Union: 1994 |date=10 November 2005 |url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1994/index_en.htm |accessdate=18 January 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614175424/http://europa.eu/abc/history/1994/index_en.htm |archivedate=14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the members of the former [[Eastern Bloc]] and [[Yugoslavia]] were all starting to move towards EU membership. Eight of these, plus Cyprus and Malta, joined in a major enlargement on 1 May 2004 symbolising the unification of East and Western Europe in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the European Union |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/index_en.htm |accessdate=25 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were followed by Bulgaria and Romania in 2007, then Croatia in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/policy/from-6-to-28-members_en|title = From 6 to 28 members|website = European Commission|date = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU has prioritised membership for the rest of the [[Western Balkans]]; [[Albania]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]], and [[Turkey]] are all formally acknowledged as candidates. while [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Kosovo]] are potential candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |access-date=19 July 2017 |url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/countries/check-current-status/ |title=European Neighbourhood Policy And Enlargement Negotiations: Check current status }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkish membership]], pending since the 1980s, is a more contentious issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Q&amp;A: Turkey's EU entry talks|date=11 December 2006|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4107919.stm |accessdate=25 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the [[Cyprus dispute]] being a long-standing hurdle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_window_of_opportunity_closes_on_cyprus_reunification_7212|title=Window of opportunity closes on Cyprus reunification|website=European Council on Foreign Relations|date = 12 July 2017|last = Aydıntaşbaş|first = Asli}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-join-eu-member-still-miles-apart-on-membership/|title=Turkey and the EU still miles apart on membership|date=25 July 2017|website = Politico|last = de La Baume|first = Maïa }}&lt;/ref&gt; relations between the EU and Turkey are strained after several incidents, mostly concerning the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt]], the [[Turkish constitutional referendum, 2017|Turkish referendum]], and the resulting [[2016–17 purges in Turkey]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This has led to the European Parliament calling for a suspension of membership talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-eu-parliament/eu-parliament-asks-for-turkish-accession-talks-to-be-suspended-idUSKBN19R194|title=EU parliament calls for Turkey accession talks to be suspended|date=6 July 2017|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation==
[[File:Familiefoto europese raad 2011.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A 2011 'family photo' of the [[European Council]], which comprises the [[head of state|heads of state]] or [[head of government|government]] of the member states, along with [[President of the European Council]] and the [[President of the European Commission]]]]
Each state has representation in the [[institutions of the European Union]]. Full membership gives the government of a member state a seat in the [[Council of the European Union]] and [[European Council]]. When decisions are not being taken by [[consensus]], [[Weighted voting|votes are weighted]] so that a country with a greater population has more votes within the Council than a smaller country (though the number of votes in relation to population is weighted disproportionately in favour of smaller member states). The [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]] rotates between each of the member states, allowing each state six months to help direct the agenda of the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Similarly, each state is assigned [[Member of the European Parliament|seats in Parliament]] according to their population (again, with the smaller countries receiving more seats per inhabitant than the larger ones). The members of the [[European Parliament]] have been elected by [[universal suffrage]] since 1979 (before that, they were seconded from [[National parliaments of the European Union|national parliaments]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The European Parliament: Historical Background|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/presidency-council-eu/|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The national governments appoint one member each to the [[European Commission]] (in accord with [[President of the European Commission|its president]]), the [[European Court of Justice]] (in accord with other members) and the [[European Court of Auditors]]. Historically, larger member states were granted an extra Commissioner. However, as the body grew, this right has been removed and each state is represented equally. The six largest states are also granted an Advocates General in the Court of Justice. Finally, the Governing Council of the [[European Central Bank]] includes the governors of the national central banks (who may or may not be government appointed) of each [[eurozone|euro area]] country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/decisions/govc/html/index.en.html|title=Governing Council|website=European Central Bank|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The larger states traditionally carry more weight in negotiations, however smaller states can be effective impartial mediators and citizens of smaller states are often appointed to sensitive top posts to avoid competition between the larger states. This, together with the disproportionate representation of the smaller states in terms of votes and seats in parliament, gives the smaller EU states a greater clout than normally attributed to a state of their size. However most negotiations are still dominated by the larger states. This has traditionally been largely through the "[[France–Germany relations|Franco-German]] motor" but Franco-German influence has diminished slightly following the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|influx of new members in 2004]] (see [[G6 (EU)|G6]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Peel, Q|date=26 March 2010|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d599e1a0-3912-11df-8970-00144feabdc0.html|title=Deal shows Merkel has staked out strong role]|work=[[Financial Times]]|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sovereignty==

# In accordance with Article 5, competences not conferred upon the Union in the Treaties remain with the member states.
# The Union shall respect the equality of member states before the Treaties as well as their national identities, inherent in their fundamental structures, political and constitutional, inclusive of regional and local self-government. It shall respect their essential State functions, including ensuring the territorial integrity of the State, maintaining law and order and safeguarding national security. In particular, national security remains the sole responsibility of each member state.
# Pursuant to the principle of sincere cooperation, the Union and the member states shall, in full mutual respect, assist each other in carrying out tasks which flow from the Treaties. The member states shall take any appropriate measure, general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union.

While the member states are sovereign, the union partially follows a [[Supranational union|supranational]] system that is comparable to [[federalism]]. Previously limited to [[European Community]] matters, the practice, known as the "[[community method]]", is currently used in most areas of policy. ''Combined sovereignty'' is delegated by each member to the institutions in return for representation within those institutions. This practice is often referred to as "pooling of sovereignty". Those institutions are then empowered to make laws and execute them at a European level.

If a state fails to comply with the [[law of the European Union]], it may be fined or have funds withdrawn.

In contrast to other organisations, the EU's style of integration has "become a highly developed system for mutual interference in each other's domestic affairs".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Cooper (strategist)|Cooper, Robert]] (7 April 2002) [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/worldview/story/0,11581,680117,00.html Why we still need empires], ''[[The Guardian]]'' (London)&lt;/ref&gt; However, on defence and foreign policy issues (and, pre-[[Lisbon Treaty]], police and judicial matters) less sovereignty is transferred, with issues being dealt with by unanimity and co-operation. Very early on in the history of the EU, the unique state of its establishment and pooling of sovereignty was emphasised by the Court of Justice:&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Notice.do?mode=dbl&amp;lng1=en,en&amp;lang=&amp;lng2=de,en,fi,fr,it,nl,sv,&amp;val=5203:cs&amp;page=&amp;hwords=null ECJ opinion on Costa vs ENEL] Eur-Lex&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|By creating a Community of unlimited duration, having its own institutions, its own personality, its own legal capacity and capacity of representation on the international plane and, more particularly, real powers stemming from a limitation of sovereignty or a transfer of powers from the States to Community, the Member States have limited their sovereign rights and have thus created a body of law which binds both their nationals and themselves...The transfer by the States from their domestic legal system to the Community legal system of the rights and obligations arising under the Treaty carries with it a permanent limitation of their sovereign rights. |[[European Court of Justice]] 1964, in reference to case of [[Costa v ENEL]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61964CJ0006 Judgment of the Court of 15 July 1964.

The question of [[Supremacy (European Union law)|whether EU law is superior to national law]] is subject to some debate. The treaties do not give a judgement on the matter but court judgements have established EU's law superiority over national law and it is affirmed in a declaration attached to the Treaty of Lisbon (the [[European Constitution]] would have fully enshrined this). Some national legal systems also explicitly accept the Court of Justice's interpretation, such as France and Italy, however in Poland it does not override the [[Constitution of the Republic of Poland|national constitution]], which it does in Germany. The exact areas where the member states have given legislative competence to the EU are as follows. Every area not mentioned remains with member states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A12012E%2FTXT Consolidated versions of the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union - Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union - Protocols - Annexes - Declarations annexed to the Final Act of the Intergovernmental Conference which adopted the Treaty of Lisbon, signed on 13 December 2007 - Tables of equivalences], Eur-Lex&lt;/ref&gt;

{{EU competences}}

As a result of the [[European sovereign debt crisis]], some [[eurozone]] states required a [[bailout]] from the EU via the [[European Financial Stability Facility]] and [[European Financial Stability Mechanism]] (to be replaced by the [[European Stability Mechanism]] from 2013). In exchange for their bailout, Greece was required to accept a large austerity plan including privatisations and a sell off of state assets. To ensure that Greece complies with the EU's demands, a "large-scale technical assistance" from the European Commission and other member states has been deployed to Greek government ministries. Some, including the [[Euro Group#President|President of the Euro Group]] [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], state that "the sovereignty of Greece will be massively limited."&lt;ref&gt;Kirschbaum, Erik (3 July 2011) {{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/03/us-greece-juncker-idUSTRE7620ZK20110703|title=Greek sovereignty to be massively limited: Juncker|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahony, Honor (4 July 2011) [http://euobserver.com/9/32582 Greece faces 'massive' loss of sovereignty], ''[[EUobserver]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="protectorate"&gt;[http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/news-brief-cover/755611-athens-becomes-eu-protectorate Athens becomes EU 'protectorate'] [[List of newspapers in Greece|To Ethnos]] via PressEurop 4 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The situation of the bailed out countries (Greece, Portugal and Ireland) has been described as being a [[Ward (law)|ward]]&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, Kyran (15 October 2011) [http://www.examiner.ie/business/business-features/reform-agendas-leading-light-170819.html Reform agenda’s leading light], [[Irish Examiner]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coy, Peter (13 January 2011) [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_04/b4212009727572.htm If Demography Is Destiny, Then India Has the Edge], [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[protectorate]]&lt;ref name="protectorate"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahler ''et al'' (2 September 2010) [http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,676507,00.html How Brussels Is Trying to Prevent a Collapse of the Euro], ''[[Der Spiegel]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://openeuropeblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/economic-protectorate.html The Economic Protectorate], [[Open Europe]] (4 February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; of the EU with some such as the [[Netherlands]] calling for a formalisation of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Leigh|last= Phillips|date =7 September 2011|url =http://euobserver.com/19/113552|work =[[EU Observer]]|title = Netherlands: Indebted states must be made ‘wards’ of the commission or leave euro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multi-speed integration==
{{Politics of the European Union}}
{{see also|Multi-speed Europe}}
EU integration is not always symmetrical, with some states proceeding with integration ahead of hold-outs. This comes in two forms; a faster integrated core where some states forge ahead with a new project, and opt-outs where a few states are excused from normal integration. The notion of multi-speed integration is anathema to some, including President Juncker, who see it as divisive to the European project and others, such as the less-integrated states, who feel they would be left behind. It is however supported by others, such as President Macron, to move forward in integration faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.politico.eu/article/juncker-to-oppose-multispeed-europe/ |title = Juncker to oppose multispeed Europe|website = Politico|date = 13 September 2017|last = Eder|first = Florian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://euobserver.com/institutional/138832 Macron revives multi-speed Europe idea], EUObserver 30 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enhanced cooperation===
{{main|Enhanced cooperation}}
There are several different forms closer integration both within and outside the EU's normal framework. The main mechanism is [[enhanced cooperation]] where nine or more states can use EU structures progress in a field that not all states are willing to partake in. One example of this is the [[European Public Prosecutor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/10/12/eppo-20-ms-confirms/ 20 member states confirm the creation of an European Public Prosecutor's Office], General Secretariat of the Council 12 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; A similar mechanism is [[Permanent Structured Cooperation]] in Defence, where the majority of EU states work in a flexible manner on defence cooperation. Other projects, such as the [[European Fiscal Compact]], operate between EU members but as a separate intergovernmental treaty outside of the official EU structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/12/11/defence-cooperation-pesco-25-member-states-participating/ Defence cooperation: Council establishes Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), with 25 member states participating], General Secretariat of the Council 11 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opt-outs===
{{main|Opt-outs in the European Union}}
A number of states are less integrated into the EU than others. In most cases this is because those states have gained an [[Opt-outs in the European Union|opt-out]] from a certain policy area. The most notable is the opt-out from the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]], the adoption of the [[euro]] as sole legal currency. Most states outside the [[Eurozone]] are obliged to adopt the euro when they are ready, but Denmark and the United Kingdom have obtained the right to retain their [[Currencies of the European Union|own independent currencies]].

Ireland and the United Kingdom also do not participate in the [[Schengen Agreement]], which eliminates internal EU border checks. Denmark has an opt out from the [[Common Security and Defence Policy]]; Denmark, Ireland and the UK have an opt-out on police and justice matters and Poland and the UK have an opt out from the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/opting_out.html Opting out], Eur-lex&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outermost regions===
{{further|Special member state territories and the European Union}}
There are a number of overseas member state territories which are legally part of the EU, but have certain exemptions based on their remoteness. These "outermost regions" have partial application of EU law and in some cases are outside of Schengen or the EU VAT area—however they are legally within the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/activity/outermost/index_en.cfm Regional policy &amp; outermost regions], European Commission&lt;/ref&gt; They all use the [[euro]] as their currency.

Entry to the EU is limited to liberal democracies and [[Freedom House]] ranks all EU states as being totally free electoral democracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2018 |title = Freedom in the World 2018: Democracy in Crisis |publisher = [[Freedom House]]|year = 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  All but 4 are ranked at the top 1.0 rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world-2018-table-country-scores |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411130830/https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world-2018-table-country-scores|archivedate=11 April 2018 |title=Freedom in the World 2018: Table of Country Scores |publisher=[[Freedom House]] |year=2018 |accessdate=|deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the exact political system of a state is not limited, with each state having its own system based on its historical evolution.

Half of member states—14 out of 28—are [[parliamentary republic]]s, while seven states are [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], meaning they have a monarch although political powers are exercised by elected politicians. Most republics and all the monarchies operate a [[parliamentary system]] whereby the head of state (president or monarch) has a largely ceremonial role with [[reserve power]]s. That means most power is in the hands of what is called in most of those countries the prime minister, who is accountable to the [[National parliaments of the European Union|national parliament]]. Of the remaining republics, five operate a [[semi-presidential system]], where competencies are shared between the president and prime minister, while one republic operates a [[presidential system]], where the president is head of state and government.

The EU is divided between [[unicameral]] (single chamber) and [[bicameral]] (dual chamber) parliaments, with 15 unicameral national parliaments and 13 bicameral parliaments. The prime minister and government are usually directly accountable to the directly elected [[lower house]] and require its support to stay in office—the exception being Cyprus with its presidential system. [[Upper house]]s are composed differently in different member states: it can be directly elected like the [[Senate of Poland|Polish senate]], indirectly elected, for example, by regional legislatures like the [[Federal Council of Austria]], unelected, but representing certain interest groups like the [[National Council of Slovenia]], unelected (though by and large appointed by elected officials) as a remnant of a non-democratic political system in earlier times (as in the [[House of Lords]] in the United Kingdom). Most (though not all) elections in the EU use some form of [[proportional representation]]. The most common type of proportional representation is the [[Party-list proportional representation|party-list system]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

There are also differences in the level of [[self-governance]] for the sub-regions of a member state. Most states, especially the smaller ones, are [[unitary state]]s; meaning all major political power is concentrated at the national level. 10 states allocate power to more local levels of government. Austria, Belgium and Germany are full federations, meaning their regions have constitutional autonomies. Denmark, Finland, France and the Netherlands are [[Federacy|federacies]], meaning some regions have autonomy but most do not. Spain and Italy have system of [[devolution]] where regions have autonomy, but the national government retains the right to revoke it. The United Kingdom has a system of asymmetric devolution, whereby [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]] enjoy a degree of self-government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McGarry |first=John |editor1-last=Weller |editor1-first=Marc |editor2-last=Nobbs |editor2-first=Katherine|encyclopedia=Asymmetric Autonomy and the Settlement of Ethnic Conflicts |year=2010 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-8122-4230-0 |pages=148–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States such as France have a number of [[Special Member State territories and the European Union|overseas territories]], retained from their [[Colonial empire|former empires]]. Some of these territories such as [[French Guiana]] are part of the EU (see outermost regions, above) while others are related to the EU or outside it, such as the [[Falkland Islands]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Withdrawal==
{{Main|Withdrawal from the European Union}}
The [[Lisbon Treaty]] made the first provision of a member state to leave. The procedure for a state to leave is outlined in [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title VI: Final Provisions#Article 50|TEU Article 50]] which also makes clear that "Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements". Although it calls for a negotiated withdrawal between the seceding state and the rest of the EU, if no agreement is reached two years after the seceding state notifying of its intention to leave, it would cease to be subject to the treaties anyway (thus ensuring a right to unilateral withdrawal).&lt;ref name="expel"/&gt; There is no formal limit to how much time a member state can take between adopting a policy of withdrawal, and actually triggering Article 50.

In a [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|non-binding referendum in June 2016]] - the result of which the government promised to implement - the United Kingdom voted to withdraw from the EU.  Termed "[[Brexit]]", this has become government policy under Prime Minister [[Theresa May]]. UK government triggered Article 50 on 29 March 2017.&lt;ref name=GuardianMay&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws|title=Theresa May to trigger article 50 by end of March 2017|last=Elgot|first=Jessica|work=The Guardian|date=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once triggered, formal talks could begin but there is no certainty of a deal and some EU officials are preparing to deal with a situation where no deal is reached after the two-year limit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.eu/article/eu-set-for-dirty-brexit-theresa-may-european-council/ EU set for ‘dirty Brexit’] Politico 24 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2016, no member state had ever voted to withdraw. However [[Greenland]], as a territory, did leave the EU in 1985 when gaining home rule from a member state (Denmark). The situation of Greenland being outside the EU while still subject to an EU member state had been discussed as a template for the pro-EU regions of the UK remaining within the EU or its single market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2016/07/07/reverse-greenland-arrangement/ Could a ‘reverse Greenland’ arrangement keep Scotland and Northern Ireland in the EU?], London School of Economics 7 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the formal withdrawal of a member state, there are a number of independence movements such as [[Catalan independentism|Catalonia]] or [[Partition of Belgium|Flanders]]&lt;!---THIS IS JUST MENTIONING TWO EXAMPLES FROM DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES, PLEASE DO NOT TURN IT INTO A LIST OF EVERY INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT IN EUROPE---&gt; which could result in a similar situation to Greenland. Were a territory of a member state to secede but wish to remain in the EU, some scholars claim it would need to reapply to join as if it were a new country applying from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;Happold, Matthew (1999) [http://www.cer.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/attachments/pdf/2011/cerwp2-2807.pdf Scotland Europa: independence in Europe?], [[Centre for European Reform]]. Retrieved 14 June 2010 (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; However, other studies claim internal enlargement is legally viable if, in case of a member state dissolution or secession, the resulting states are ''all'' considered [[Succession of states|successor states]].&lt;ref&gt;The Internal Enlargement of the European Union, Centre Maurits Coppieters Foundation [http://www.irla.cat/documents/the-internal-enlargement-of-the-EU.pdf] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a [[European Citizens' Initiative]] that aims at guaranteeing the continuity of rights and obligations of the European citizens belonging to a new state arising from the democratic secession of a European Union member state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euinternalenlargement.org/|title=英語ぺらぺら君中級編で余った時間を有効活用する|website=www.euinternalenlargement.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suspension==
{{main|Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union}}
There is no provision to expel a member state, but [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title I: Common Provisions#Article 7|TEU Article 7]] provides for the suspension of certain rights. Introduced in the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]], Article 7 outlines that if a member persistently breaches the EU's founding principles (liberty, democracy, human rights and so forth, outlined in [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title I: Common Provisions#Article 2|TEU Article 2]]) then the [[European Council]] can vote to suspend any rights of membership, such as voting and representation. Identifying the breach requires unanimity (excluding the state concerned), but sanctions require only a qualified majority.&lt;ref name="suspend"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/suspension_clause.html Suspension clause], Europa glossary. Retrieved 22 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The state in question would still be bound by the obligations treaties and the Council acting by majority may alter or lift such sanctions. The [[Treaty of Nice]] included a preventative mechanism whereby the Council, acting by majority, may identify a potential breach and make recommendations to the state to rectify it before action is taken against it as outlined above.&lt;ref name="suspend"/&gt; However, the treaties do not provide any mechanism to expel a member state outright.&lt;ref name="expel"&gt;Athanassiou, Phoebus (December 2009) [http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/scplps/ecblwp10.pdf Withdrawal and Expulsion from the EU and EMU, Some Reflections] (PDF), European Central Bank. Retrieved 8 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related states==
{{Supranational European Bodies|size=600px|align=right}}
There are a number of countries with strong links with the EU, similar to elements of membership. Following Norway's decision not to join the EU, it remained one of the members of the [[European Economic Area]] which also includes [[Iceland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] (all former members have joined the EU, and Switzerland rejected membership). The EEA links these countries into the EU's market, extending the [[Internal market|four freedoms]] to these states. In return, they pay a membership fee and have to adopt most areas of [[Law of the European Union|EU law]] (which they do not have direct impact in shaping). The democratic repercussions of this have been described as "fax democracy" (waiting for new laws to be faxed in from [[Brussels and the European Union|Brussels]] rather than being involved in drafting them).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Ekman |first = Ivar |date = 27 October 2007 |url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/26/news/norway.php |title = In Norway, EU pros and cons (the cons still win) |work = International Herald Tribune |accessdate=30 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different example is [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which has been under international supervision. The [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is an international administrator who has wide-ranging powers over Bosnia and Herzegovina to ensure the peace agreement is respected. The High Representative is also the EU's representative, and is in practice appointed by the EU. In this role, and since a major ambition of Bosnia and Herzegovina is to join the EU, the country has become a ''de facto'' protectorate of the EU. The EU appointed representative has the power to impose legislation and dismiss elected officials and civil servants, meaning the EU has greater direct control over Bosnia and Herzegovina than its own states. Indeed, the [[Flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina|state's flag]] was inspired by the [[Flag of Europe|EU's flag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Chandler |first = David |date = 20 April 2006 |url = http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/0000000CB02A.htm |title = Bosnia: whose state is it anyway? |publisher = Spiked Politics |accessdate=30 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same manner as Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[Kosovo]] is under heavy EU influence, particularly after the ''de facto'' transfer from [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UN]] to EU authority. In theory Kosovo is supervised by [[European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo|EU missions]], with justice and policing personal training and helping to build up the state institutions. However the EU mission does enjoy certain executive powers over the state and has a responsibility to maintain stability and order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Kurti |first = Albin |date = 2 September 2009 |url = http://euobserver.com/9/28602 |title = Comment: Causing damage in Kosovo |work = EUobserver |accessdate=2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Bosnia, Kosovo has been termed an "EU protectorate".&lt;ref&gt;Judah, Tim (18 February 2008) [http://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/detail/article/kosovo-the-era-of-the-eu-protectorate-dawns/ Kosovo: the era of the EU protectorate dawns], [[European Union Institute for Security Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,536354,00.html 'Kosovo Is not Independent, It Is an EU Protectorate'], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' (19 February 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/10711623 Independence day], ''[[The Economist]]'' (17 February 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is also the largely defunct term of ''associate member''. It has occasionally been applied to states which have signed an [[European Union Association Agreement|association agreement]] with the EU. Associate membership is not a formal classification and does not entitle the state to any of the representation of free movement rights that full membership allows. The term is almost unheard of in the modern context and was primarily used in the earlier days of the EU with countries such as Greece and Turkey. Turkey's association agreement was the 1963 [[Ankara Agreement]], implying that Turkey became an associate member that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=14 November 2005 |url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/eu-turkey-relations/article-129678 |title=EUTurkey relations |publisher=EurActiv |accessdate=4 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706153600/http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/eu-turkey-relations/article-129678 |archivedate=6 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date = 10 June 2008 |url = https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/episodes/turkeys-tigers/report-card-turkey-and-eu-membership/introduction/583/ |title = Turkey's Tigers, Report Card: Turkey and EU Membership?: Introduction |publisher = Public Broadcasting Service |accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Present association agreements include the [[Stabilisation and Association Process|Stabilisation and Association Agreements]] with the western Balkans; these states are no longer termed "associate members".

[[File:Presidential Standard of Pakistan (1956-1967).svg|thumb|right|200px|Presidential Standard (1956-1967)]]

The '''Presidential Standard of Pakistan''' is the official flag of the [[President of Pakistan]].

== Design ==

The Presidential Standard consists of the background of the [[Flag of Pakistan]] with the gold Presidential Crest replacing the white crescent and star found in the Flag of Pakistan. The Presidential Crest consists of a smaller crescent and star flanked by wheat branches with the words "Pakistan" written in Urdu underneath.

== Use ==

The Presidential Standard is displayed only in the presence of the President of Pakistan, particularly in the office and official residence of the President of Pakistan. It is always displayed alongside the Flag of Pakistan. It is also flown alongside the Flag of Pakistan in the Presidential motorcade. The Presidential Standard is never flown atop any building.

== History ==

The Presidential Standard was first adopted in 1956 and has since been redesigned twice: in 1974 and 1998.

P. Lewis, « Breteuil, Roger de, earl of Hereford (fl. 1071–1087) », Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Orderic Vital]], Histoire de Normandie, Éd. (Guizot, 1826), vol.II, livre IV, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Stenton]], Anglo-Saxon England 3rd édition, ([[Oxford University]], 1971), p. 610-613.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disobeying King William==
He did not keep on good terms with [[William the Conqueror]], and in 1075, disregarding the King's prohibition, he married his sister Emma to [[Ralph de Guader|Ralph Guader, Earl of Norfolk]], at the famous bridal of Norwich.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Revolt of the Earls==
Immediately afterwards, [[Revolt of the Earls|the two earls rebelled]]. Roger, who was to bring his force from the west to join forces with those of the Earl of Norfolk, was held in check at the [[River Severn]] by the [[Worcestershire]] [[fyrd]], which the English Bishop [[Wulfstan (died 1095)|Wulfstan]], [[Walter de Lacy (died 1085)|Walter de Lacy]], and other Normans brought into the field against him.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Trial, sentence, and reprieve==
On the collapse of his confederate's uprising, Roger was tried for treason&lt;ref&gt; Placita Anglo-Normannica [electronic resource] : Law Cases from William I to Richard I — Preserved in Historical Records (London: S. Low, Marston, Searle, &amp; Rivington, 1879) p11&lt;/ref&gt; before the Great Council, for their role in the [[Revolt of the Earls]]. Roger was deprived of his lands and earldom in 1075, and sentenced to perpetual imprisonment.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; [[Ralph de Gael|Ralph Breton]] and [[Waltheof, 1st Earl of Northumberland]] were charged as co-conspirators.&lt;ref&gt; [[Placita Anglo-Normannica]] [electronic resource] : Law Cases from William I to Richard I — Preserved in Historical Records (London: S. Low, Marston, Searle, &amp; Rivington, 1879) p11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger was released, with other political prisoners, at the death of [[William I of England|William I]] in 1087.

==Family==
Though Roger is not known to have married, he left two sons, Reginald and Roger.  Living during the reign of [[Henry I of England]], they were described as young men of great promise, but nonetheless were excluded from succeeding to Roger's lands.  This has led to disagreement among scholars as to whether or not they were of legitimate birth.  Reginald fitz Count, son of Earl Roger, would marry Emmeline de Ballon, the daughter and heiress of [[Hamelin de Ballon]], whose inherited land he held in her right.  Their descendants, using the de Ballon surname were lords of [[Much Marcle]].&lt;ref&gt;J.

[[File:Green Sunburst Flag.svg|thumb|250px|right|Traditional variation of the sunburst flag]]

'''The sunburst flag''' ({{lang-ga|An Gal Gréine}}) is a flag associated with early [[Irish nationalism]], and more recently, youth wings of [[Irish republican]] groups such as [[Na Fianna Éireann]]. The flag is first thought to have been used in 1858 by the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]]. The sunburst flag is still used today, by both republican groups and the [[Irish language]] group [[Conradh na Gaeilge]].

== History and origins of the flag ==
The sunburst flag's design is inspired by the [[Fianna]] of [[Irish mythology]]. Described as brave warriors who performed a large number of impressive feats,{{Who|date=April 2011}} the Fianna referred to themselves as either ''Gal Gréine'' or ''Scal Ghréine'', which both mean sunburst.
The sunburst flag, and the symbol of the sunburst itself came into use by Irish nationalists during the 19th century. In 1858, the Irish Republican Brotherhood adopted the flag as their symbol. During the [[American Civil War]], the sunburst motif was incorporated by several Irish regiments in their standards. In 1893 the Irish-language group called [[Conradh na Gaeilge]] established themselves, using the flag as the group's symbol in reference to the Fianna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ie-sun.html Detailed information of the flags history @ crwflags.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Communist Party of Ireland]] and [[dissident republican]] groups [[Republican Network for Unity]] and [[Saoradh]] have incorporated it into their emblems.

{{Taxation}}

The '''Tax Justice Network''' (or '''TJN'''), is an independent [[advocacy group]] consisting of a coalition of international researchers and activists with a shared concern about [[tax avoidance]], [[tax competition]], [[tax evasion]], and [[tax havens]].  It has a particular focus on [[offshore financial centres]] that behave as [[corporate tax haven]]s.
The Tax Justice Network gathers organizations, social movements, and advocates for international tax cooperation, and against tax evasion and tax competition. TJN's goal is to achieve progressive, democratic, and socially just tax systems. It carries out campaigns from an internationalist perspective whose purpose is to develop a fiscal system that is favourable to the poor in developing and developed countries, that finances public good, and that mitigates public wrongs such as pollution and unacceptable inequality.

==Foundation and growth==
TJN grew out thank to the process of the global social forum and the international movement of [[ATTAC]]. TJN is a multilingual, non-partisan, non-governmental, plural and diverse network. It has as members and militants’ organizations of social movements and national, regional and local civil society, as well as activists for justice in taxes, researchers, journalists, development specialists, trade unionists, and professionals of taxation, politicians and officials.

[[Civil Society]] is progressively committing itself to the issues of capital flight, tax evasion and tax fraud and competition, which are generally seen as obstacles to the mobilization of national resources in developing countries. In June 2000, one of the main NGOs dedicated to development published a report titled Tax Havens: “Unlocking the hidden billions to eradicate poverty”. The creation of the Tax Justice Network was in part a consequence of the publication of that report. In the United States, the Citizens for Tax Justice Organization has undertaken a similar effort, although with a national focus. On the contrary, TJN focuses primarily on the international level.

Since 2000, ATTAC, which was born in France in support of the called Tobin tax, has become a movement of international pressure that faces the problems of tax fraud, financial crime and the abuse of tax havens. In April 2005, ATTAC-Spain asked the Government not to recognize the fictitious and instrumental companies registered in tax havens before the Spanish legal system. And ATTAC-Germany played a decisive role in the creation of Tax Justice Network, whose diffusion is spreading in the Spanish-speaking countries.

Until recently, international fiscal policy was hardly a field for civil campaigns, as can be demonstrated by an example. In June 2003, the G8 meeting in Evian summoned 300,000 demonstrators in Geneva, 3,000 people registered to pressure the delegates and Geneva came to a standstill. In December 2003 the UN Committee of Fiscal Experts met in Geneva and TJN was the only civil society organization that attended and intervened in the meeting.

==Functions and objectives.==
The main purpose is to combat the lobbying activities of accounting, business or law organizations that use considerable amounts of time and money to ensure favourable tax treatment for wealthy individuals and powerful organizations that shape their customers. 
Other functions of TJN:

* Conducts campaigns for social change through public debate and education. Public understanding of tax issues is the pre-requirement for international tax justice. The Network makes information available through the media as well as through conferences and seminars, the Internet, news bulletins, printed publications, symbolic actions, demonstrations and promotion and defense of its objectives. We base our activities on solvent research and expert knowledge.

* Facilitates cooperation among its members and sharing information and communication. It organizes international exchange and policy debates to harmonize the opinions and concerns of our members. This process forms the basis for the comprehensive global campaigns on international fiscal policy.

==Management== 
 
It is managed by its member organizations as well as by individual militants. It ensures the visibility of member organizations in their activities and participation in the decision-making of the Network. It operates in accordance with the principles of participatory democracy, its empowerment, transparency, accountability and equal opportunities. TJN encourages and supports, when necessary, member organizations and individuals to participate in decision making. The Network supports the development of national TJN campaigns, particularly in developing countries. The activities of the Network are coordinated by an international secretariat. 
The Network includes:
* national, regional and local civil society (specially important)
* development organizations and several NGOs
* religious groups
* unions
* researchers 
* journalists
* economists
* financial professionals

==Empirical results==

In March 2005, TJN published the results of an investigation that demonstrated $ 11.5 million of the personal wealth of wealthy individuals held in offshore financial centers. In addition, to minimize taxes or to avoid paying them, a large proportion of this wealth is managed in about 70 tax havens. If the income from this wealth patrimony will pay the taxes in the countries where these rich individuals reside or where they obtain their wealth, the additional tax collection available for the financing of public services and for investment in the whole world would be around 255,000 million of annual dollars. We emphasize that this estimate of the loss of tax revenues does not include the tax evasion of transnational corporations or the reduction of tax revenues caused by tax competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Price of Offshore|url=http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/Price_of_Offshore.pdf|publisher=Tax Justice Network|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TJN has reported on the OECD [[Base erosion and profit shifting]] (BEPS) projects and conducted their own research that the scale of corporate taxes being avoided by multinationals is an estimated $660bn in 2012 (a quarter of US multinationals’ gross profits), which is equivalent to 0.9% of World GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bna.com/tax-avoidance-costing-n57982085579/| title=Tax Avoidance Costing U.S. $189 Billion: Tax Justice Network| publisher=Bloomberg News | date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.taxjustice.net/scalebeps/ | title=Base Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS| publisher=Tax Justice Network | date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In July 2012, following a study into wealthy individuals with offshore accounts, the Tax Justice Network published claims regarding deposits worth at least $21 trillion (£13 trillion), potentially even $32 trillion, in secretive tax havens.

'''''The Halder Diaries''''' is a collection of diaries written by German Colonel General [[Franz Halder]]. His diaries from his time as Chief of the Army General Staff have been an important source for authors who have written about such subjects as [[Adolf Hitler]], [[World War II]] and the [[NSDAP]]. In [[William Shirer]]'s ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'', Halder's diary is cited hundreds of times.

The diaries were published as ''The Halder diaries: The Private War Journals of Colonel General Franz Halder'' in 2 volumes in 1976 by [[Westview Press]] of [[Boulder, Colorado]], with an introduction by [[Trevor N. Dupuy]] ({{ISBN|9780891581062}}). The original German version had the title ''Kriegstagebuch'' ("War Diaries") and the translation had been published in 8 volumes in 1948 by the Office of Chief Counsel for War Crimes, Office of Military Government for Germany (U.S.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/halder-diaries-the-private-war-journals-of-colonel-general-franz-halder/oclc/2189197|title=Worldcat catalogue record for ''The Halder diaries''|accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Nations Partisan Infantry Korea''' (UNPIK), also known as '''the White Tigers''', was a unit during the [[Korean War]] that was consolidated under the control of [[Eighth United States Army]], [[Korea]]'s 8th Army G-3 Miscellaneous Group, 8086th and 8240th [[Army]] Unit. The details of the undercover operation were made public by the US Army in 1990. The unit worked deep inside [[North Korea]] to gather [[military intelligence|intelligence]], conduct raids and [[sabotage]], rescue [[Prisoner of war|POWs]], recruit and lead [[guerrilla]] armies and create confusion in the enemy's rear.

==Operations==
The island Wollaedo in the Yellow Sea was used as a base by pro-Southern partisans during the war.  This position was regularly bombarded by Northern artillery on the mainland of [[Ryongyon County|Cape Changsan]].  In 1952, a group of partisans working together with UNPIK landed on the cape.  They successfully took control of and destroyed the artillery site, escaping with small losses.&lt;ref&gt;

UNPIK was disbanded in 1954.

==Legacy and commemoration==
A documentary about the unit has been produced by [[History (U.S. TV channel)|the History Channel]] as part of their [[Heroes under fire]] series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=74637 "The White Tigers" The History Channel DVD series] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061222140018/http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=74637 |date=December 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unit is widely seen as the second steppingstone towards the setting up of a permanent [[special forces]] doctrine in the US Army.{{cn|date=August 2012}}
