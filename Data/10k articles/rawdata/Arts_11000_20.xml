During the '''20th century''' there was a huge increase in the variety of [[music]] that people had access to. Prior to the invention of mass market [[gramophone record]]s (developed in 1892) and [[radio broadcasting]] (first commercially done ca. 1919–20), people mainly listened to music at live [[Classical music]] concerts or [[musical theatre]] shows, which were too expensive for many lower-income people; on early [[phonograph]] players (a technology invented in 1877 which was not mass-marketed until the mid-1890s); or by individuals performing music or singing songs on an amateur basis at home, using [[sheet music]], which required the ability to sing, play, and read music. These were skills that tended to be limited to [[middle class|middle-class]] and [[upper class|upper-class]] individuals. With the mass-market availability of gramophone records and radio broadcasts, listeners could purchase recordings of, or listen on radio to recordings or live broadcasts of a huge variety of [[song]]s and musical pieces from around the globe. This enabled a much wider range of the population to listen to performances of [[Classical music]] [[symphony|symphonies]] and [[opera]]s that they would not be able to hear live, either due to not being able to afford live-concert tickets or because such music was not performed in their region.

[[Sound recording]] was also a major influence on the development of [[popular music]] genres, because it enabled recordings of [[song]]s and bands to be inexpensively and widely distributed nationwide or even, for some artists, worldwide. The development of relatively inexpensive reproduction of music via a succession of formats including [[vinyl record]]s, [[compact cassette]]s, [[compact disc]]s (introduced in 1983) and, by the mid-1990s, [[digital audio]] recordings, and the transmission or broadcast of audio recordings of music performances on radio, of video recordings or live performances on television, and by the 1990s, of audio and video recordings via the [[Internet]], using [[file sharing]] of [[digital audio]] recordings, gave individuals from a wide range of socioeconomic classes access to a diverse selection of high-quality music performances by artists from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arditi|first1=David|title=iTunes: Breaking Barriers and Building Walls|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03007766.2013.810849|website=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|publisher=Informa UK Limited|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of [[multitrack recording]] in 1955 and the use of [[audio console|mixing]] had a major influence on [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music]], because it enabled [[record producer]]s to mix and overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Allan. ''Cultural Production in and Beyond the Recording Studio''. Routledge, 2014. (Multitrack recording and mixing made the recording "...studio a tool of musical composition" in which producers could "...create a reality which could not actually exist" in a live performance. p. 25)&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[sound recording]] and [[audio engineering]] technologies and the ability to edit these recordings gave rise to new subgenres of classical music, including the [[Musique concrète]] (1949) and [[acousmatic]]&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer, P. (1966), Traité des objets musicaux, Le Seuil, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; (1955) schools of electronic composition. In the 1970s, [[African-American]] [[hip hop music]]ians began to use the [[phonograph|record turntable]] as a musical instrument, creating rhythmic and percussive "[[scratching]]" effects by manipulating a [[vinyl record]] on the turntable.

In Beethoven's and [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s time in the 19th century, the orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments which was very rarely modified. As time progressed, and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as [[Berlioz]] and [[Mahler]], the 20th century saw that instrumentation could practically be hand-picked by the composer. [[Saxophone]]s were used in some 20th-century orchestra scores such as [[Vaughan Williams]]' Symphonies [[Symphony No. 6 (Vaughan Williams)|No.6]] and [[Symphony No. 9 (Vaughan Williams)|9]] and [[William Walton]]'s [[Belshazzar's Feast (Walton)|''Belshazzar's Feast'']], and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. Twentieth-century orchestras  generally include a [[string section]], [[woodwinds]], [[brass instruments]], [[percussion]], [[piano]], [[celesta|celeste]], [[harp]](s),&lt;ref name="classical-orchestra-description-page"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Classical Orchestra Description Page|url=http://www.classiccat.net/iv/orchestra.info.php|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with other instruments called for occasionally, such as [[electric guitar]]&lt;ref&gt;Lagnella, David. ''The Composer's Guide to the Electric Guitar''. Mel Bay Publications, 2003. (Ex. Composers Tim Brady, Steve Mackey, Rhys Chatham, René Lussie, Glenn Branca, Scott Johnson and Eliot Sharp used the electric guitar in their chamber works and orchestral works, p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[electric bass]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker-Hall, Helen. ''Music by Black Women Composers: A Bibliography of Available Scores''. Center for Black Music Research, 1995. (Ex. Composer Margaret Harris-Schofield wrote ''Piano Concerto No. 2'' in 1971, scored for solo piano, full orchestra, electric bass and drums. p. 35)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th century saw dramatic innovations in musical forms and styles. Composers and songwriters explored new forms and sounds that challenged the previously accepted rules of music of earlier periods, such as the use of [[altered chord]]s and [[extended chord]]s in 1940s-era [[Bebop jazz]]. The development of powerful, loud [[guitar amplifier]]s and [[sound reinforcement system]]s in the 1960s and 1970s permitted bands to hold large concerts where even those with the least expensive tickets could hear the show. Composers and songwriters experimented with new musical styles, such as genre fusions (e.g., the late 1960s fusion of [[jazz]] and [[rock music]] to create [[jazz fusion]]). As well, composers and musicians used new [[music technology (electric)|electric]], [[music technology (electronic and digital)|electronic, and digital instruments and musical devices]]. In the 1980s, some styles of music, such as [[electronic dance music]] genres such as [[house music]] were created largely with [[synthesizer]]s and [[drum machine]]s. Faster modes of transportation such as [[jet flight]] allowed musicians and fans to travel more widely to perform or hear shows, which increased the spread of musical styles.

===Modernism===
{{Main article|Modernism (music)}}
In the early 20th century, many composers, including [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Giacomo Puccini]], and [[Edward Elgar]], continued to work in forms and in a musical language that derived from the 19th century. However, [[modernism]] in music became increasingly prominent and important; among the most important [[Modernism (music)|modernists]] were [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Claude Debussy]], and post-[[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] composers such as [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Richard Strauss]], who experimented with form, tonality and orchestration.&lt;ref name="Botstein 2001."&gt;Botstein 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]], and [[Franz Schreker|Schreker]] were already recognized before 1914 as modernists, and [[Charles Ives|Ives]] was retrospectively also included in this category for his challenges to the uses of tonality.&lt;ref name="Botstein 2001."/&gt; Composers such as [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]], and [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]] combined classical and jazz idioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wooten|first1=Roy|title=Classical Music Meets American Jazz|url=http://nmaam.org/2016/04/20/classical-music-meets-american-jazz/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807163225/http://nmaam.org/2016/04/20/classical-music-meets-american-jazz/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=7 August 2016|website=National Museum of African American Music|publisher=National Museum of African American Music|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late-Romantic and modernist nationalism was found also in British, American, and Latin-American music of the early 20th century. Composers such as [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Alberto Ginastera]], [[Carlos Chávez]], [[Silvestre Revueltas]], and [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]] used folk themes collected by themselves or others in many of their major compositions.

===Microtonal music===
{{Main article|Microtonal music}}
In the early decades of the 20th century, composers such as [[Julián Carrillo]], [[Mildred Couper]], [[Alois Hába]], [[Charles Ives]], [[Erwin Schulhoff]], [[Ivan Wyschnegradsky]] turned their attention to [[quarter tone]]s (24 equal intervals per octave), and other finer divisions. In the middle of the century composers such as [[Harry Partch]] and [[Ben Johnston (composer)|Ben Johnston]] explored [[just intonation]]. In the second half of the century, prominent composers employing microtonality included [[Easley Blackwood, Jr.]], [[Wendy Carlos]], [[Adriaan Fokker]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Ezra Sims]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[La Monte Young]], and [[Iannis Xenakis]].

===Neoclassicism===
{{Main article|Neoclassical music}}
A dominant trend in music composed from 1923 to 1950 was neoclassicism, a reaction against the exaggerated gestures and formlessness of late Romanticism which revived the balanced forms and clearly perceptible thematic processes of earlier styles. There were three distinct "schools" of neoclassicism, associated with [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Paul Hindemith]], and [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. Similar sympathies in the second half of the century are generally subsumed under the heading "[[Postmodern music|postmodernism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Whittall 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental music===
{{Main article|Experimental music}}
A compositional tradition arose in the mid-20th century—particularly in North America—called "experimental music". Its most famous and influential exponent was [[John Cage]] (1912–1992).&lt;ref&gt;Grant 2003, 174&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cage, "an experimental action is one the outcome of which is not foreseen",&lt;ref&gt;Cage 1961, 39&lt;/ref&gt; and he was specifically interested in completed works that performed an unpredictable action.&lt;ref&gt;Mauceri 1997, 197.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the composers who influenced [[John Cage]] were [[Erik Satie]] (1866–1925), [[Arnold Schoenberg]] (1874–1951) and [[Henry Dixon Cowell]] (1897–1965).

===Minimalism===
{{Main article|Minimal music}}
Minimalist music, involving a simplification of materials and intensive repetition of motives began in the late 1950s with the composers [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]], and [[Philip Glass]]. Later, minimalism was adapted to a more traditional symphonic setting by composers including Reich, Glass, and [[John Coolidge Adams|John Adams]]. Minimalism was practiced heavily throughout the latter half of the century and has carried over into the 21st century, as well as composers like [[Arvo Pärt]], [[Henryk Górecki]] and [[John Tavener]] working in the ''[[holy minimalism]]'' variant. For more examples see ''[[List of 20th-century classical composers]]''.

===Contemporary classical music===
{{Main article|Contemporary classical music}}

Contemporary classical music can be understood as belonging to the period that started in the mid-1970s to early 1990s, which includes [[Modernism (music)|modernist]], [[Postmodern music|postmodern]], [[Neoromanticism (music)|neoromantic]], and [[Eclecticism in music|pluralist music]].&lt;ref&gt;Botstein "[http://www.grovemusic.com Modernism]" §9: The Late 20th Century (subscription access).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term  may also be employed in a broader sense to refer to all post-1945 musical forms.&lt;ref&gt;"Contemporary" in Du Noyer 2003, 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many composers working in the early 21st century were prominent figures in the 20th century. Some younger composers such as [[Oliver Knussen]], [[Wolfgang Rihm]], [[Georg Friedrich Haas]], [[Judith Weir]], [[George Benson]], [[Richard Barrett (composer)|Richard Barrett]], [[Simon Bainbridge]], [[John Luther Adams]], [[Toshio Hosokawa]], [[Bright Sheng]], [[Kaija Saariaho]], [[Tan Dun]], [[Magnus Lindberg]], [[Philippe Manoury]], [[David Lang (composer)|David Lang]],  [[Hanspeter Kyburz]], [[James MacMillan]], [[Mark-Anthony Turnage]], [[Thomas Adès]], [[Marc-André Dalbavie]], [[Unsuk Chin]], [[Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf]], and [[Michael Daugherty]] did not rise to prominence until late in the 20th century. For more examples see ''[[List of 21st-century classical composers]]''.

==Electronic music==
[[File:Stockhausen 1991 Studio.jpg|thumb|[[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] in the electronic-music studio of [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]], Cologne in 1991]]
{{Main article|Electronic music}}

For centuries, instrumental music had either been created by singing, or using [[music technology#Mechanical|mechanical music technologies]], such as drawing a bow across a string that is strung on a hollow instrument or plucking taut gut or metal strings ([[string instruments]]), constricting vibrating air ([[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]] and [[Brass instrument|brass]]) or hitting something to make rhythmic sounds ([[percussion instrument]]s). In the early twentieth century, [[music technology (electronic and digital)|electronic devices]] were invented that were capable of generating sound electronically, without an initial mechanical source of vibration. As early as the 1930s, composers such as [[Olivier Messiaen]] incorporated electronic instruments into live performance. While [[sound recording]] technology is often associated with the key role it played in enabling the creation and mass marketing of [[popular music]], new electric and electronic sound recording technology was used to produce art music, as well. The [[musique concrète]] (French: “concrete music”), developed about 1948 by Pierre Schaeffer and his associates, was an experimental technique using recorded sounds as raw material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Musique concrète – Musical composition technique|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/musique-concrete|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following [[World War II]], some composers were quick to adopt developing electronic technology. Electronic music was embraced by composers such as [[Edgard Varèse]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Milton Babbitt]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Bruno Maderna]], [[Henri Pousseur]], [[Karel Goeyvaerts]], [[Ernst Krenek]], [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Herbert Brün]], and [[Iannis Xenakis]]. In the 1950s the film industry also began to make extensive use of electronic [[soundtrack]]s. Major rock groups that were early adopters of synthesizers include [[The Moody Blues]], [[The Beatles]],&lt;ref&gt;W. Everett, ''The Foundations of Rock: from "Blue suede shoes" to "Suite: Judy blue eyes"'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), {{ISBN|0-19-531023-3}}, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Monkees]],&lt;ref&gt;E. Lefcowitz, ''The Monkees Tale'' (San Francisco CA: Last Gasp, 1989), {{ISBN|0-86719-378-6}}, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Doors]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Pinch and F. Trocco, ''Analog Days: The Invention and Impact of the Moog Synthesizer'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2004), {{ISBN|0-674-01617-3}}, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folk music==
{{Main article|Folk music}}
Folk music, in the original sense of the term as coined in the 18th century by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], is music produced by communal composition and possessing dignity, though by the late 19th century the concept of ‘folk’ had become a synonym for ‘nation’, usually identified as peasants and rural artisans, as in the [[Merry England|Merrie England movement]] and the [[Gaelic revival|Irish and Scottish Gaelic Revivals]] of the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Pegg 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Folk music was normally shared and performed by the entire community (not by a special class of expert or professional performers, possibly excluding the idea of amateurs), and was transmitted by word of mouth ([[oral tradition]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nettl|first1=Bruno|title=Folk Music|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/folk-music|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, folk music was also borrowed by composers in other genres. Some of the work of [[Aaron Copland]] clearly draws on American folk music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aaron Copland, 1900–1990: His Music Taught America About Itself|url=http://www.manythings.org/voa/people/Aaron_Copland.html|website=ManyThings.org|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important work on registering traditional [[Music of Southeastern Europe|tunes of the Balkanic region]] was that of [[Béla Bartók]] since it is probably the first composer who was interested in recording audios as well as analysing them from an ethnological point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Béla Bartók The Musical Quarterly Vol. 33, No. 2 (Apr., 1947), pp. 240–257&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bluegrass music===
{{Main article|Bluegrass music}}

Bluegrass music is a form of [[American roots music]], and a related genre of [[country music]]. Influenced by the music of [[Appalachia]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert Cantwell, ''Bluegrass Breakdown:  The Making of the Old Southern Sound'' (University of Illinois Press, 2002), pgs 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Bluegrass has mixed roots in [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish]], [[Folk music of Scotland|Scottish]], [[Music of Wales|Welsh]],  and [[Folk music of England|English]]&lt;ref&gt;Musicologist [[Cecil Sharp]] collected hundreds of folk songs in the Appalachian region, and observed that the musical tradition of the people "seems to point to the North of England, or to the Lowlands, rather than the Highlands, of Scotland, as the country from which they originally migrated. For the Appalachian tunes...have far more affinity with the normal English folk-tune than with that of the Gaelic-speaking Highlander."

Olive Dame Campbell &amp; Cecil J. Sharp, ''English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians, Comprising 122 Songs and Ballads, and 323 Tunes'', G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1917, pg xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; traditional music, and was also later influenced by the music of [[African-Americans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Tennessee folklore sampler: selections from the Tennessee folklore society | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0Z90XdzMKE0C&amp;pg=PA324&amp;dq=i'm+working+on+a+building+song&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=flZ7TvlDiqK2B9vqse4P&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=i'm%20working%20on%20a%20building%20song&amp;f=false| chapter = Field Recordings of Southern Black Music | last = Nemerov | first = Bruce | pages = 323–324 | year = 2009 | publisher = Univ. of Tennessee Press | accessdate = 2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; through incorporation of [[jazz]] elements.

Settlers from the United Kingdom and Ireland arrived in [[Appalachia]] during the 18th century, and brought with them the musical traditions of their homelands. These traditions consisted primarily of English and Scottish [[ballad]]s—which were essentially unaccompanied narrative—and dance music, such as Irish [[reel (dance)|reel]]s, which were accompanied by a fiddle.&lt;ref name=olson&gt;Ted Olson, "Music — Introduction".  ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1109–1120.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many older bluegrass songs come directly from the [[British Isles]]. Several Appalachian bluegrass ballads, such as "[[Pretty Saro]]", "[[Barbara Allen (song)|Barbara Allen]]", "[[The Cuckoo (song)|Cuckoo Bird]]" and "[[House Carpenter]]", come from [[England]] and preserve the English ballad tradition both melodically and lyrically.&lt;ref name="cuckoo"&gt;{{cite news|title=The beauty and mystery of ballads|last=Goldsmith|page=G5|first=Thomas|date=February 6, 2005 |work=[[Raleigh News &amp; Observer|The Raleigh News &amp; Observer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, such as [[The Twa Sisters]], also come from [[England]]; however, the lyrics are about Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jacobs, ''English Fairy Tales'', [[s:English Fairy Tales/Binnorie|transcript]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some bluegrass fiddle songs popular in Appalachia, such as "Leather Britches", and "[[Pretty Polly (ballad)|Pretty Polly]]", have Scottish roots.&lt;ref&gt;Cecelia Conway, "Celtic Influences".  ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee, 2006), p. 1132.&lt;/ref&gt;  The dance tune [[Cumberland Gap (folk song)|Cumberland Gap]] may be derived from the tune that accompanies the Scottish ballad [[Bonnie George Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;Song notes in ''Bascom Lamar Lunsford: Ballads, Banjo Tunes, and Sacred Songs of Western North Carolina'' [CD liner notes]. Smithsonian Folkways, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Other songs have different names in different places; for instance in [[England]] there is an old ballad known as "[[A Brisk Young Sailor Courted Me]]", but exactly the same song in North American bluegrass is known as "I Wish My Baby Was Born".&lt;ref&gt;the version performed by Tim Eriksen, Riley Baugus and Tim O'Brien for the Cold Mountain Soundtrack was based on this song and is lyrically identical to it&lt;/ref&gt;

In bluegrass, as in some forms of jazz, one or more instruments each takes its turn playing the melody and improvising around it, while the others perform  [[accompaniment]]; this is especially typified in tunes called [[Breakdown (music)#Bluegrass|breakdowns]]. This is in contrast to [[old-time music]], in which all instruments play the melody together or one instrument carries the lead throughout while the others provide accompaniment. Breakdowns are often characterized by rapid [[tempo]]s and unusual instrumental dexterity and sometimes by complex [[chord change]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A short History of Bluegrass Music|url=http://renoandharrell.com/content/short-history-bluegrass-music|website=Reno &amp; Harrell|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three major subgenres of bluegrass and one unofficial subgenre. [[Traditional bluegrass]] has musicians playing folk songs, tunes with simple traditional chord progressions, and using only acoustic instruments, with an example being [[Bill Monroe]]. [[Progressive bluegrass]] groups may use electric instruments and import songs from other genres, particularly rock &amp; roll. Examples include [[Cadillac Sky]] and [[Bearfoot (American band)|Bearfoot]]. "[[Bluegrass gospel]]" has emerged as a third subgenre, which uses [[Christian]] lyrics, soulful three- or four-part [[harmony]] singing, and sometimes the playing of [[instrumentals]]. A newer development in the bluegrass world is Neo-traditional bluegrass; exemplified by bands such as [[The Grascals]] and [[Mountain Heart]], bands from this subgenre typically have more than one lead singer. Bluegrass music has attracted a diverse following worldwide. Bluegrass pioneer Bill Monroe characterized the genre as: "[[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[bagpipes]] and ole-time fiddlin'. It's [[Methodism|Methodist]] and [[Holiness movement|Holiness]] and [[Baptists|Baptist]]. It's [[blues]] and [[jazz]], and it has a high lonesome sound."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billmonroe.com/music/ "Bill Monroe: The Father of Bluegrass"], billmonroe.com, retrieved 17 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opera==
{{Main article|Opera#Contemporary, recent, and modernist trends}}

In the early years of the century, [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] [[chromatic harmony]] was extended by opera composers such as [[Richard Strauss]] (''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'', 1905; ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', 1906–1908; ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'', 1910; ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'', 1912; ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'', 1917), [[Claude Debussy]] (''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]'', 1902), [[Giacomo Puccini]] (''[[Madama Butterfly]]'', 1904; ''[[La fanciulla del West]]'', 1910; ''[[Il trittico]]'', 1918), [[Ferruccio Busoni]] (''[[Doktor Faust]]'', 1916, posthumously completed by his student [[Philipp Jarnach]]), [[Béla Bartók]] (''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'', 1911–17), [[Leos Janáček]] (''[[Jenůfa]]'', 1904; ''[[Destiny (Janáček)|Osud]]'', 1907; ''[[Kát´a Kabanová]]'', 1919-1921) and [[Hans Pfitzner]] (''[[Palestrina (opera)|Palestrina]]'', 1917).

Further extension of the chromatic language finally broke with tonality and moved into the style of [[atonal music]] in the early operas of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] (''[[Erwartung]]'', 1909; ''[[Die glückliche Hand]]'', 1912) and his student [[Alban Berg]] (''[[Wozzeck]]'', 1925), both of whom adopted [[twelve-tone technique]] for their later operas: Schoenberg's ''[[Moses und Aron]]'', and Berg’s ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]''. Neither of these operas were completed in their composers’ lifetimes, however, so that the first completed opera using the twelve-tone technique was ''[[Karl V]]'' (1938) by [[Ernst Krenek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sitsky|first1=Larry|title=Music of the Twentieth-century Avant-garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313296895|page=238|edition=illustrated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sgDJKVXraE0C&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=first+completed+opera+using+the+twelve-tone+technique+was+Karl+V&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TTID7SQzJP&amp;sig=vVRed7jJhbOWH034rXGx4s3YF2I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyl8iGj6TNAhUJ3mMKHa9zBiwQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=first%20completed%20opera%20using%20the%20twelve-tone%20technique%20was%20Karl%20V&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most important operas of the twenties and thirties were composed by the Russian [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] (''[[The Nose (opera)|The Nose]]'', 1928 and ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Ledi Makbet Mtsenkovo Uyezda]]'' [Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District], 1932).&lt;ref&gt;{{Riding, Alan. Eyewitness Companions: Opera: Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the neoclassicism that became fashionable in the 1920s is represented by Stravinsky's [[opera buffa]] ''[[Mavra]]'' (1922) and his opera-oratorio ''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus Rex]]'' (1927). Later in the century his last opera, ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' (1951), also marks the end of the neoclassical phase of his compositions. Other operas of this period by composers identified as neoclassicists include [[Paul Hindemith]]'s ''[[Mathis der Maler (opera)|Mathis der Maler]]'' (1938), [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Voina y Mir (opera)|Voina y Mir]]'' (War and Peace, 1941–1943), [[Bohuslav Martinu]]'s ''[[Julietta aneb snár]]'' (1937) and [[Francis Poulenc]]'s ''[[Les mamelles de Tirésias]]'' (1945).{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In the sixties, it should be noted, the [[Bernd Alois Zimmermann]] opera, ''[[Die Soldaten]]'' (1965), had a great impact.{{Clarify|date=December 2017}}&lt;!--Big box-office success, was it? Or did it cause riots in cities across the globe?--&gt;   

One of the most particular{{Clarify|date=February 2018}}&lt;!--Is this meant in the sense of "peculiar", "exacting", or what?--&gt; operas of the seventies was ''[[Le Grand Macabre]]'', by György Ligeti. It deals with the subject of mortality through irony and collage.

The most internationally accepted post–World War II composer of operas was Englishman [[Benjamin Britten]] (''[[Peter Grimes (opera)|Peter Grimes]]'', 1945; ''[[The Rape of Lucretia]]'', 1946; ''[[Albert Herring (opera)|Albert Herring]]'', 1947; ''[[Billy Budd (opera)|Billy Budd]]'', 1951; ''[[Gloriana]]'', 1953; ''[[The Turn of the Screw (opera)|The Turn of the Screw]]'', 1954; ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (opera)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', 1960; ''[[Owen Wingrave]]'', 1970; ''[[Death in Venice (opera)|Death in Venice]]'', 1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twentieth-Century Opera|url=http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/entertainment/opera-twentieth-century-opera.html|website=Infoplease|publisher=Sandbox Networks, Inc.|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2018}}&lt;!--Links to a secondary link to the Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia article "Opera Glass".

Popular music includes [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] tunes, [[ballad]]s and singers such as [[Frank Sinatra]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilliland 1969, show 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship (particularly, the relative value) of classical music and popular music is a controversial question. [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]] writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;Neat divisions between "folk" and "popular", and "popular" and "art", are impossible to find... arbitrary criteria [are used] to define the complement of "popular". "Art" music, for example, is generally regarded as by nature complex, difficult, demanding; "popular" music then has to be defined as "simple", "accessible", "facile". But many pieces commonly thought of as "art" ([[George Frideric Handel|Handel's]] ''[[Hallelujah Chorus]]'', many [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] songs, many [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] [[aria]]s) have qualities of simplicity; conversely, it is by no means obvious that the [[Sex Pistols]]' records were "accessible", [[Frank Zappa]]'s work "simple", or [[Billie Holiday]]'s "facile".&lt;ref&gt;Middleton 1990, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Polka===
{{Main article|Polka}}
The polka, which first appeared in Prague in 1837, continued to be a popular form of dance music through the 20th century, especially in Czechoslovakia, Poland, and areas of the United States with a large population of central-European descent. A particularly well-known 20th-century example is [[Jaromír Vejvoda]]’s ''Modřanská polka'' (1927), which became popular during World War II in Czechoslovakia as "Škoda lásky" ("A Waste of Love"), in Germany as the ''Rosamunde-Polka'', and among the allied armies as the ''[[Beer Barrel Polka]]'' (as a song, known as "Roll out the Barrel"). In the United States, the "Eastern style" Polish urban polka remained popular until about 1965. Polka music rose in popularity in Chicago in the late 1940s after [[Walter Jagiello|Walter ‘Li’l Wally’ Wallace Jagiello]] created "[[Hunky Culture|honky]]" polka by combining the Polish-American rural polka with elements of Polish folksong and ''[[krakowiak]]''. A later, rock-influenced form is called "dyno" polka.&lt;ref&gt;Černušák, Lamb, and Tyrrell 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''2 Frogs in the West''''' ({{lang-fr|2 frogs dans l'ouest}}) is a Canadian [[comedy-drama]] film, released in 2010.&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;"Cross-country adventure leaves much behind". ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]'', October 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The directorial debut of filmmaker and actor Dany Papineau, the film premiered in [[Montreal]] on October 8, 2010.&lt;ref name=gazette /&gt;

== Plot ==
The film stars Mirianne Brulé as Marie, a restless young woman from Quebec who decides to drop out of university and hitchhike west to [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]], [[British Columbia]] on a voyage of self-discovery, much to her parents' dismay.&lt;ref name="gazette" /&gt; The journey to British Columbia is not an easy one, as along the way Marie experiences a myriad of bumps and mishaps, with her finally arriving in Whistler only to have her luggage stolen.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://frenchfilmfestival.org.uk/oldbrochures/brochure2011.pdf|title=La Fête du Cinema|last=|first=|date=|website=frenchfilmfestival.org.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this exasperating ordeal a man by the name of Jean-François (Papineau), who is also from Québec, takes Marie in to stay with him and his two roommates, his ex-girlfriend Gaby (Malka) and their gay friend Brad (Barton). During her time there Marie experiments sexually with Gaby and through this is drawn into an unexpected love triangle with both J-F and Gaby.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The film's cast also includes Brandon Barton, Juan Riedinger, Anik Vermette, [[Germain Houde]], Diane Lavallée, Valérie Chevalier, [[Charlie David]], Bruno Baronet, Adam Bergquist, Rick Tae, [[Niels Schneider]], Bill Marchant and Linda Darlow.

== Inspiration for the film ==
The film is directly inspired by director Papineau's own experience travelling from his home province of Québec to Alberta during his undergraduate degree. While in Québec he had been studying engineering at Sherbrooke, but after spending a summer on a ranch in Banff, Alberta, decided to stay there instead of returning to Sherbrooke. After having such a successful time in the western part of Canada he decided to enroll at the Vancouver Film School for a year long program and ended up living in Vancouver for six years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Papineau first wrote ''2 Frogs'' as a 21 minute short film in 2004, and after receiving much acting success as a result, was able to turn the short film into the feature length film it is today. During an interview with Papineau at the 2010 Whistler Film Festival, Papineau highlighted how the inspiration for the movie came from how the young adults who come to Whistler from all around the world go there for a couple of months to help determine what they want to do with their lives. He expressed how he felt a lot of people would recognize themselves in the film because of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=whistlerfilm|title=WFF2010 - Meet the Artist - Dany Papineau|date=2010-12-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6sQXsuQsxU|accessdate=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
After its debut in Montreal, the movie received excellent reviews from film critics. The film was showcased at film festivals around the world, receiving many accolades for its involvement in the LGBT film community. In 2012, it was highlighted as one of the best films at the Durban Gay and Lesbian Film Festival &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.artsmart.co.za/2012/02/2-frogs-in-west.html|title=2 FROGS IN THE WEST|website=news.artsmart.co.za|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also featured in many film events devoted to the LGBT community, including QFest: the Annual Houston International LGBTQ Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mfah.org/calendar/2-frogs-west|title=2 Frogs in the West|website=The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although recognized abroad, the film also received recognition in Canada, in publications like the Globe and Mail&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1513822319/fulltextPDF/BD6748A3570E4710PQ/1?accountid=14701|title=I wanted to tap into the mystery that is Joan of Arc|last=MacDonald|first=Gayle|date=March 24, 2011|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was presented in multiple Canadian film festivals. The film not only received accolades for its portrayal of the LGBT community but also for its portrayal of Canadian culture. As the film illustrates the typical adolescent Canadian experience, of a young adult leaving their long-time home in the Eastern provinces to find work in the West of Canada, the film also received awards reflecting its Canadian influences. As a highlight, the film was chosen to close the 2010 Whistler Film Festival, after the short film, "Two Frogs in the West", that it was based on had been previously featured at the festival in 2004.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/article-363332/vancouver/whistler-film-festival-2010-quebec-director-dany-papineau-finds-filmmaking-success-bc|title=Whistler Film Festival 2010: Quebec director Dany Papineau finds filmmaking success in B.C.|date=2010-12-07|work=Georgia Straight Vancouver's News &amp; Entertainment Weekly|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the festival, the film won the festival's Best Mountain Culture Film award, an award which directly reflected the spirit of the film and the area in which the festival was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/canadian-thriller-whistleblower-wins-borsos-56518|title=Canadian Thriller 'Whistleblower' Wins Borsos Competition at Whistler Film Festival|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it received positive feedback at film festivals for its portrayal of both Canadian culture and the LGBT community, it received mixed reviews from its general audience for its "predictable" plotline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eyeforfilm.co.uk/review/two-frogs-in-the-west-film-review-by-robert-munro|title=Two Frogs In The West (2010) Movie Review from Eye for Film|website=www.eyeforfilm.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some online reviews of the film described it has being unimaginative and the acting to be underwhelming&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=2 Frogs dans l'Ouest (2010)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1673459/reviews|accessdate=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another reviewer claimed that "the problems with ''2 Frogs'' are based pretty much entirely in the screenplay".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flickchickcanada.blogspot.ca/2012/06/canadian-film-review-2-frogs-in-west.html|title=Canadian Film Review: 2 Frogs in the West (2010)|website=flickchickcanada.blogspot.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; No matter how negative or positive the reviews it received were, one thing remained consistent: that Papineau has great potential as a director. No matter the downfalls described by the film's critics, ''2 Frogs'' "demonstrates that it's possible for a film to be bad, while still showcasing the positive potential of its writer/director".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''A Beautiful Mind''''' is the original [[soundtrack album]], on the Decca Records label, of the 2001 film ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'' starring [[Russell Crowe]], [[Jennifer Connelly]] (who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as "Alicia Nash"), [[Christopher Plummer]] and [[Paul Bettany]]. The original [[Film score|score]] and [[song]]s were composed and conducted by [[James Horner]].

The album garnered nominations for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]] and the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]]. Music critics felt that the musical score fit the film well, but believed it to be similar to several of Horner's previous films.

==Development==
Composer [[James Horner]] was a frequent collaborator with [[Ron Howard]], the director of ''A Beautiful Mind''. Horner desired to feature vocals reminiscent of being midway between a girl and woman,&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-51458075.html |title=Analysis: Film scores for "A Beautiful Mind" and "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence" |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |first=Lynn|last=Neary |date=March 10, 2002 |accessdate=January 12, 2014}} {{Subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote the score specifically for 15-year-old [[Welsh people|Welsh]] singer [[Charlotte Church]]. In an interview, she stated that it was "one of the most haunting and beautiful [things] I have ever performed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-79349220.html |title=Charlotte Has an Oscar in Her Beautiful Mind |work=[[The Mail on Sunday]] |first=Katie|last=Nicholl|date=October 21, 2001 |accessdate=January 12, 2014}} {{Subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; To convey "the beauty of mathematics," Horner decided to use the idea of a [[kaleidoscope]], as its "patterns are always changing, and things move very quickly, but in moving so quickly, they create other patterns that move very slowly underneath."&lt;ref name=DailyVariety/&gt; He added that these changing patterns were conveyed with the piano and Church's voice.&lt;ref name=DailyVariety&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83030727.html |title=Magic lies in the methods: This year's crop of possible contenders use mix of traditional and unusual scoring elements |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]] |first=Jon |last=Burlingame |date=January 23, 2002 |accessdate=January 12, 2014}} {{Subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''Empire'' magazine, Danny Graydon gave the soundtrack four out of five stars. He thought the score contained elements of Horner's previous films ''[[Sneakers (1992 film)|Sneakers]]'' (1992) and ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'' (1999), but said "if you can forgive that, this is a clever, masterful and romantic score that captures a brilliant mind in conflict."&lt;ref name=EmpireReview&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?SID=7787 |title=Empire's A Beautiful Mind Soundtrack Review |work=Empire |first=Danny |last=Graydon |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the tracks "Creating Government Dynamics" and "Cracking The Russian Codes", Graydon opined that Church's "poignant vocals mix well with the frenetic piano and strings to represent Nash’s brilliance," and wished that her voice had been used more in the film.&lt;ref name=EmpireReview/&gt;

Dan Goldwasser of [[Soundtrack.net]] also found similarities to the score in ''Bicentennial Man'', but thought Horner's work fit the film regardless, explaining "it effectively underscores the drama and romance, and even provides a few bits of tension for the action scene."&lt;ref name=Soundtrackreview/&gt; Goldwasser concluded that "while it all works well in the film, there is enough about this score that just seemed to {{sic}} 'familiar' to make it stand out.&lt;ref name=Soundtrackreview/&gt; Contributing to [[National Public Radio]], Andy Trudeau believed Church's particular voice adds a "human element.

'''''An Essay on Liberation''''' is a 1969 book by the [[Frankfurt School]] philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]].

==Summary==
Marcuse argues that advanced industrial society has rendered the traditional conception of human freedom obsolete, and outlines new possibilities for contemporary human liberation.

==Reception==
Brian Easlea writes that Marcuse, having in the past been attacked by Marxists for his "quite unambiguous indictment of science and perhaps feeling that he had directed too much attention away from the rulers of advanced industrial society", apparently "reversed direction" in ''An Essay on Liberation'' by endorsing science and technology as "great vehicles of liberation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Easlea, Brian |title=Science and Sexual Oppression: Patriarchy's Confrontation with Woman and Nature |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |location=London |year=1981 |page=25 |isbn=0 297 77894 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7239">'''Art methodology''' refers to a ''studied'' and constantly reassessed, questioned method within [[the arts]], as opposed to a method merely applied (without thought). This process of studying the method and reassessing its effectiveness allows [[art]] to move on and change. It is not the thing itself but it is an essential part of the process. 

An [[artist]] drawing, for instance, may choose to draw from what he or she [[observation|observes]] in front of them, or from what they ''imagine'' or from what they already know about the subject. These 3 methods will, very probably, produce 3 very different pictures. A careful [[methodology]] would include examination of the [[Art materials|materials]] and [[tool]]s used and how a different type of canvas/brush/paper/pencil/rag/camera/chisel etc. would produce a different effect. The artist may also look at various effects achieved by starting in one part of a canvas first, or by working over the whole surface equally. An author may experiment with [[stream of consciousness writing]], as opposed to [[naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] [[narrative]], or a combination of styles.

==Fine Art compared with Traditional Crafts==
In stark contrast to [[fine art]] practice is the [[tradition]]al [[craft]] form. With traditional crafts, the method is handed down from generation to generation with often very little change in techniques. It is usually fair to say that folk crafts employ a method but not an art methodology, since that would involve rigorous questioning and criticising of the tradition.

==Art Methodology compared with Science Methodology==
An art methodology differs from a [[scientific method|science]] [[methodology]], perhaps mainly insofar as the artist is not always after the same goal as the scientist. In art it is not necessarily all about establishing the exact truth so much as making the most effective form ([[painting]], [[drawing]], [[poem]], [[novel]], [[performance]], [[sculpture]], [[video]], etc.) through which ideas, feelings, perceptions can be communicated to a public. With this purpose in mind, some artists will exhibit preliminary sketches and notes which were part of the process leading to the creation of a work. Sometimes, in [[Conceptual art]], the preliminary process is the only part of the work which ''is'' exhibited, with no visible end result displayed. In such a case the  ''"[[Travel|journey]]"'' is being presented as more important than the destination. Conceptual artist [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]] once put on an exhibition where the door of the gallery remained shut and a sign on the door informed visitors that the gallery would be closed for the exhibition. These kind of works question accepted concepts, such as that of having a tangible [[work of art]] as end result.

==Some Art Methodology statements==
===Global Responsibility===
The [[Peace Through Art]] methodology developed by the International Child Art Foundation (ICAF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icaf.org |title=International Child Art Foundation |accessdate=2008-08-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080811024014/http://www.icaf.org/| archivedate= 11 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; was recognized as a Stockholm Challenge Finalist for best practice and innovative initiative, in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. ICAF's statement on the methodology of the programme says: "the Peace Through Art methodology draws upon the creativity and imagination of young people, and teaches them the ethics of responsibility in this interdependent global village that has come to be our world. The methodology incorporates best practices from the fields of psychology, conflict resolution and peace education, while employing the power of the arts for self-expression, healing and communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=ICAF's Peace Through Art methodology is Stockholm Challenge Finalist |publisher=The International Child Art Foundation |date=2004-09-07 |url=http://www.icaf.org/news/newsfiles/200210000001.html |accessdate=2008-08-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080907063554/http://www.icaf.org/news/newsfiles/200210000001.html| archivedate= 7 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art Therapy===
In [[Art Therapy]] and other applied forms of art to the needs of groups within the community art methodology is built up in relation to other methodologies, such as that of [[psychotherapy]]. 

Pauline Mottram SRAsTh, gave a short paper entitled ''“Towards developing a methodology to evaluate outcomes of Art Therapy in Adult Mental Illness.”'' for the October 2000 TAoAT Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baat.org/taoat/mottram2.html |title=Towards developing a methodology to evaluate outcomes of Art Therapy in Adult Mental Illness |first=Pauline |last=Mottram |accessdate=2008-08-06 |publisher=British Association of Art Therapists |date=October 2000| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080723212828/http://www.baat.org/taoat/mottram2.html| archivedate= 23 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here's an excerpt: 

''"In addressing the effectiveness challenge and in seeking a means of measuring outcomes of the art therapy service that I deliver, I have sought a methodology that can provide a valid and reliable quantitative outcome, whilst still respecting the aesthetic and humanistic nature of art therapy practice. This endeavour is made all the more complex by the fact that art therapy lacks a fully developed theory and it has a fragile research base. Generally it is argued that art therapy is more compatible with qualitative research designs that encompass subjectivity, rather than quantitative objective methods. Kaplan (1998, p95) states that ‘Qualitative is exploratory and theory building. Quantitative  tests hypothesis in order to refine and validate theory.’ She holds that art therapy cannot afford to reject either form of inquiry."''

===Generative Art===
In ''"The Methodology of Generative Art"''  by  Tjark Ihmels and Julia Riedel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/themes/generative-tools/generative-art/1/]&lt;/ref&gt; an online article at Media Art Net&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mozart]]'s "musical game of dice" is cited as a precedent for the methodology of Generative art which, say the authors, has ''"established itself in nearly every area of artistic practice (music, literature [3], the fine arts)."'': 

''"Mozart composed 176 bars of music, from which sixteen were chosen from a list using dice, which then produced a new piece when performed on a piano. Sixteen bars, each with eleven possibilities, can result in 1,116 unique pieces of music. Using this historical example, the methodology of generative art can be appropriately described as the rigorous application of predefined principles of action for the intentional exclusion of, or substitution for, individual aesthetical decisions that sets in motion the generation of new artistic content out of material provided for that purpose."''

'''Bani Thani''' refers to an [[Indian miniature|Indian miniature painting]] painted by [[Nihâl Chand]] from the Marwar school of [[Kishangarh]]. It portrays a woman who is elegant and graceful. The painting's subject, Bani Thani, was a singer and poet in [[Kishangarh]] in the time of king Sawant Singh (1748–1764).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/51852/Bani-Thani Bani Thani] britannica.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.indiaprofile.com/art-crafts/kishangarhminiatures.htm Kishangarh Miniatures - In Quest Of Divine Love] indiaprofile.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/hindi/india/2012/10/121017_monalisa_india_ss.shtml bbc.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; She has been compared to the [[Mona Lisa]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Inspired by [[Radha]], Bani Thani is characterized by idealized distinct features such as arched eyebrows, lotus-like elongated eyes and pointed chin.&lt;ref name="Sodhi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sodhi |first1=Jiwan|title=A Study of Bundi School of Painting |chapter=Kishangarh |publisher=Abhinav |year=1999 |pages=25–26 |isbn=81-7017-347-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This painting was featured in an Indian stamp issued on 5 May 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mintageworld.com/media/detail/2689-Bani-Thani-The-Indian-Mona-Lisa/?gclid=CKmjq-GxrdMCFdERaAod_xUMfQ|title=‘Bani Thani’: The Indian Mona Lisa|work=Mintage World|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Legend ==
Bani Thani was believed to be the mistress of King Sawant Singh, and later became one of his wives. Her real name was Vishnupriya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.speakingtree.in/article/bani-thani|title=BANI THANI|website=www.speakingtree.in|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a singer employed by his stepmother and he was drawn to her because of her beauty and singing. She came to be known as 'Bani Thani', which means "the decked out lady", because of the exquisite jewellery and makeup that she used to adorn herself with after becoming queen. He also wrote poetry for her under the pen name of Nagari Das. Their love bloomed due to a shared interest in singing, poetry and devotion for [[Krishna]]. She also wrote poetry under the pen name of Rasikbihari. Later, he commissioned his artists to depict their relationship in a way similar to the love between Radha and Krishna. Both lovers died in the 1760s. They have twin [[chhatris]] dedicated to them near the Nagari Kunj temple.

== Style and theme ==
The Kishangarh school of art is notable for its elongated style, with ''"arched eyebrows, lotus-like elongated eyes and pointed chin"'' a highly idealized facial form reminiscent of Indian sculpture art.&lt;ref&gt;A Study of Bundi School of Painting
By Jiwan Sodhi, page 146&lt;/ref&gt; Kishangarh was influenced by [[Hadoti|Būndi]] painting in its use of lush vegetation, dramatic night skies, vivid movement and [[Mughal art|Mughal]] painting in its use of side-profile portraits, though it can be distinguished from both of them due to its extremely meticulous details, rich colours and fine technique.&lt;ref&gt;A Study of Bundi School of Painting
By Jiwan Sodhi, page 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/South-Asian-arts/Visual-arts-of-India-and-Sri-Lanka-Ceylon#ref533114|title=South Asian arts - Visual arts of India and Sri Lanka (Ceylon)|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patron-king Savant Singh was a member of the [[Vallabha Acharya|Vallabhācārya]] sect devoted to [[Krishna]], due to which religiously themed paintings flourished in the court under his patronage. The paintings of Kishangarh school are characterised by a religious fervour and this might have been the reason why the portraiture of the queen was compared to, and is believed to have been inspired by, the figure of Radha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Kishangarh-painting#ref26813|title=Kishangarh painting {{!}} Indian art|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Sringara-rasa Nayika ==
Within the [[Ashta Nayika]] classification system of heroines, the Bani Thani is identified as the Vasakasajja Nayika type, with the element of [[Sringara]] rasa (romantic love) predominating. Hence, the painting conveys the passionate and romantic elements of the legend. She has been portrayed with all the elements of Sringara and exaggerated facial features which are unrealistic but striking. This style of portraiture later became the standard of beauty in all the later paintings of the Kishangarh school.

'''''Better Out Than In''''' was a residency undertaken by [[pseudonym]]ous [[graffiti artist]] and political activist [[Banksy]] in [[New York City]] during October 2013. Banksy unveiled at least one work of art daily, documenting it on both a dedicated website and an [[Instagram]] account. The majority of the works were [[stencil graffiti]] and chiefly political, a distinctive characteristic of Banksy. Other pieces and multimedia exhibits toyed with [[dark humor]] and [[Political satire|satire]].

The unpredictability of the show and Banksy's elusive nature stirred excitement amongst fans, while [[Defacement (vandalism)|defacement]] from competing street artists and vandals became an imminent problem. While Banksy's works were inherently illegal, no official complaints were reported to the police; most property owners praised the art and some took measures to protect it. The month-long residency drew controversy amongst some locals for its more politically strong pieces, and received mixed reviews from critics. 

An HBO documentary film covering this period and residency titled ''[[Banksy Does New York]]'' was released in 2014.

==Background==
On 1 October 2013, Banksy announced on his website that he would be attempting to host a show in New York City for the entire month. This came after posters promoting an October event started showing up in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vankin|first=Deborah|title=Banksy show to take place in New York -- but where is Banksy now?|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-banksy-chinatown-but-where-is-banksy-now20131001,0,6799862.story|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=21 October 2013|date=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes_announcement&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryzik|first=Melena|title=Banksy Announces a Monthlong Show on the Streets of New York|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/banksy-announces-a-monthlong-show-on-the-streets-of-new-york/|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=21 October 2013|date=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title ''Better Out Than In'' is a reference to a quote by [[impressionist]] [[Paul Cézanne]], "All pictures painted inside, in the studio, will never be as good as those done outside."&lt;ref name=cbs_lookout&gt;{{cite web|title=New Yorkers On The Lookout For Banksy Street Art Creations|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/10/06/new-yorkers-on-the-lookout-for-banksy-street-art-creations/|work=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Village Voice]]'', Banksy said "New York calls to graffiti writers like a dirty old lighthouse. We all want to prove ourselves here," and that he chose it for the high foot traffic and hiding places.&lt;ref name=village_interview&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Keegan|title=Village Voice Exclusive: An Interview With Banksy, Street Art Cult Hero, International Man of Mystery|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2013-10-09/art/banksy-better-out-than-in-new-york-residency-street-art-graffiti/full/|work=[[The Village Voice]]|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The works Banksy has included in ''Better Out Than In'' primarily consist of [[stencil graffiti]], much of which are political in nature. His first installment, which he captioned "the street is in play", depicted a child reaching for a bottle of spray paint on a sign reading "graffiti is a crime".&lt;ref name=usnews&gt;{{cite web|last=Sneed|first=Tierney|title=So How Is Banksy's New York Street Art Spree Going?|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/10/08/so-how-is-banksys-new-york-street-art-spree-going|work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sign was stolen and later replaced by [[Queens]]-based graffiti group [[Smart Crew]] with a new sign that read "street art is a crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chung|first=Jen|title=Smart Crew Sorta Recreated Banksy's Stencil After Sign Was "Stolen"|url=http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/smart_crew_sorta_recreated_banksys.php#photo-2|work=[[Gothamist]]|accessdate=20 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005000804/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/smart_crew_sorta_recreated_banksys.php#photo-2|archivedate=5 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most of his other works, the piece has audio accompaniment that can be heard either on the website or by calling a toll-free 800 number.&lt;ref name=nydaily_les&gt;{{cite news|last=Stebner|first=Beth|title=Street artist Banksy gets political in latest Lower East Side work|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/banksy-political-latest-les-work-article-1.1480889|work=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], Banksy's fifth work was housed in a delivery truck as a "mobile garden," which included [[theatrical property]] showing a rainbow, waterfall, and butterflies. The following day Banksy posted a photo of a tracking device he found under the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Li|first=Shirley|title=Banksy watch: The street artist's latest works -- and defacements|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2013/10/11/banksy-street-art-new-york-tour/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zeveloff|first=Julie|title=Banksy's 5th Work In New York Will Be A 'Mobile Waterfall' Inside A Delivery Truck|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/banksy-garden-inside-a-delivery-truck-2013-10|work=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banksy's installments are located all across the [[Borough (New York City)|five boroughs]], with some being purely [[Multimedia art|multimedia exhibits]]. On 6 October, as a way to have made an installment in [[Dumbo, Brooklyn]], a primary arts district of the city, Banksy posted a video featuring the [[Walt Disney]] character [[Dumbo]] being shot down by [[Syrian]] rebels, the meaning behind which puzzled many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dunning|first=Jennifer|title=Banksy kills Dumbo in new video showing Syrian rebels shooting down elephant|url=http://www.cbc.ca/newsblogs/yourcommunity/2013/10/banksy-kills-dumbo-in-new-video-showing-syrian-rebels-shooting-down-elephant.html|work=CBC News|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:"Hammer Boy" Banksy in Upper West Side October 2013.jpg|thumb|left|''Hammer Boy'' was the 20th installment, located on the [[Upper West Side]]. Utilizing an existing [[siamese connection]] fire hydrant, it depicts a child playing a [[high striker]].]]

On 9 October, Banksy unveiled one of the more elaborate and politically strong pieces of the series. It featured armed soldiers and horses spray-painted on a car and trailer in an empty lot in the Lower East Side. Instead of commentary about the work, the accompanying audio was that of a classified video from the [[July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike]].&lt;ref name="nydaily_les" /&gt; After being dismantled, the car was towed away to prevent further defacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carlson|first=Jen|title=Photos: LES Banksy Car Has Been Towed To A Safe Place|url=http://gothamist.com/2013/10/15/photos_les_banksy_being_dismantled.php#photo-1|work=Gothamist|accessdate=20 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018051843/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/15/photos_les_banksy_being_dismantled.php#photo-1|archivedate=18 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day 11 saw an elaborate political display questioning the "casual cruelty" of the meat industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hubbard|first=Amy|title='Sirens of the Lambs': Banksy fills slaughterhouse truck with toys|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-banksy-sirens-of-the-lambs-20131014,0,4832074.story|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=21 October 2013|date=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entitled ''Sirens of the Lambs'', Banksy drove around a military-style cargo truck filled with squealing, stuffed animatronic livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brooks|first=Raillan|title=Banksy Day 11: A Truck Full of Very Loud Stuffed Animals In the Meatpacking District|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2013/10/banksy_day_11_sirens_of_the_lambs.php|work=[[The Village Voice]]|accessdate=21 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015150158/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2013/10/banksy_day_11_sirens_of_the_lambs.php|archivedate=15 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The truck fittingly made its debut in [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan]], but toured the rest of the city in the following weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zeveloff|first=Julie|title=Banksy Unleashes A Creepy Slaughterhouse Delivery Truck On The Meatpacking District|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/banksy-truck-filled-with-stuffed-animals-2013-10|work=Business Insider|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banksy unveiled one of his most controversial pieces of the series on 15 October, with a depiction of the [[Lower Manhattan]] skyline featuring the former [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|Twin Towers]], with a burnt-orange [[chrysanthemum]] in place where one of the hijacked airplanes struck the North Tower.&lt;ref name=nytimes_race /&gt;&lt;ref name=mirroruk&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Natalie|title=Banksy in New York: Twin Towers graffiti with orange flower 'explosion' is latest controversial street art installation|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/banksy-new-york-twin-towers-2459315|work=Mirror News|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The silhouette appeared on the side of a building in [[TriBeCa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zeveloff|first=Julie|title=Banksy Pays Homage To The Twin Towers In Today's Artwork|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/banksy-pays-homage-to-the-twin-towers-2013-10|work=Business Insider|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an identical depiction along the [[Brooklyn Heights Promenade]], facing the downtown skyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Banksy Reveals 9/11 Tribute Piece In New York City|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/15/banksy-911-tribute_n_4101204.html|work=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=21 October 2013|first=Priscilla|last=Frank|date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brooklyn Heights piece was eventually buffed out by the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=City ‘cleans up’ after Banksy art|url=https://nypost.com/2013/10/17/city-cleans-up-after-banksy-art/|work=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; requiring chemicals and a high-powered pressure washer.

Banksy extended his work beyond the canvas and city street with other political statements, including on 16 October, when he crafted a giant [[fiberglass]] sculpture of [[Ronald McDonald]], with a real live Banksy assistant shining its shoes. It was unveiled in [[the Bronx]] but was moved outside of a different [[McDonald's]] restaurant across the city around lunch time for several days. The work criticized the "heavy labor required to sustain the polished image of a mega-corporation", as the narrator of the audio accompaniment put it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grant |first=Drew |url=http://observer.com/2013/10/banksys-ronald-mcdonald-statue-and-live-shoeshine-boy-take-manhattan/ |title=Banksy Unveils 'Shoeshine Boy' at McDonald's &amp;#124; The New York Observer |publisher=[[The New York Observer]]|date=16 October 2013 |accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jeane MacIntosh, Larry Celona and Bruce Golding |url=https://nypost.com/2013/10/16/banksy-clowns-around-in-new-work/ |title=Banksy zings McDonald’s &amp;#124; New York Post |publisher=New York Post |date=16 October 2013 |accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 October there was a pair of paintings that Banksy collaborated on with Os Gemeos depicting a single soldier amongst masked citizens and vice versa. "The audio commentary Banksy provided suggests that this piece functions both as situational criticism of the art world as well as a tribute to the Occupy movement. Yet it also recognizes that the installation may be unsuccessful at actually advancing any agenda".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Banksy In New York|last = Mock|first = Ray|publisher = Carnage NYC|year = |isbn = 978-0-9906437-0-8|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banksy's second trip to the [[South Bronx]] was on 21 October and resulted in a piece depicting a child spray-painting the words "Ghetto 4 Life" on a wall, while a butler waited on him with a platter of spray paints. The work immediately drew a crowd from fans, despite angering many residents, who found the message offensive.&lt;ref name=independent_bronx&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyatt|first=Daisy|title=Banksy upsets Bronx residents with 'Ghetto 4 Life' graffiti|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/banksy-upsets-bronx-residents-with-ghetto-4-life-graffiti-8898535.html|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2 November 2013|location=London|date=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=daily_bronx&gt;{{cite news|last=Scarborough|first=Joey|title=Banksy’s latest work annoys Bronx residents|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/banksy-ghetto-4-life-work-offends-article-1.1492198|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sphinx sculpture appeared on a worksite in [[Willets Point, Queens|Willets Point]] on 22 October, entitled ''Everything but the kitchen sphinx'', and was quickly swarmed by eager Banksy fans. The attention caught the workers interest, who were reportedly selling bricks for $100 each, and onlookers watched as it was loaded into a truck and taken away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gothamist.com/2013/10/22/who_owns_the_queens_banksy_sculptur.php#photo-1|title=Who "Owns" The Queens Banksy Sculpture?|work=Gothamist|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesledger.com/stories/2015/22/banksy_2015_05_29_q.html|title=A Queens’ creation by street artist Banksy resurfaces in New York|work=TimesLedger|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fate of this piece was heavily chronicled by the HBO documentary ''[[Banksy Does New York]]'' (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/style/2014/11/things-we-learned-from-the-banksy-takes-new-york-hbo-documentary/sphinx|title=15 Things We Learned From the "Banksy Does New York" HBO Documentary The Sphinx piece at Willets Point in Queens was lifted by mechanics in the area who were about to lose their business.|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was taken from its original site, kept in a garage and later appeared in the Art Miami New York modern art fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesledger.com/stories/2015/22/banksy_2015_05_29_q.html|title=A Queens’ creation by street artist Banksy resurfaces in New York|work=TimesLedger|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:"Waiting in Vain" Banksy in Hells Kitchen October 2013.jpg|thumb|left|''Waiting in Vain'', Banksy's 24th installment outside a [[Hustler Club]] in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]].]]

The 23rd installment was cancelled due to police activity, according to Banksy's official website, which stirred rumors that he had come under arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yakas|first=Ben|title=Today's New Banksy Was...Cancelled By Police Activity|url=http://gothamist.com/2013/10/23/photos_new_banksy_piece_goes_up_in.php|work=Gothamist|accessdate=3 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026041501/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/23/photos_new_banksy_piece_goes_up_in.php|archivedate=26 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same day, an outlined canvas with the caption "Better Out Than In #AnonymousGuestbook" appeared on a building in [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]]. The idea of an open-canvas collaborative piece was presented to Banksy two weeks prior by a community art director. The story then led many to believe the "anonymous guestbook" was outlined by Banksy himself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldstein|first=Sasha|title=Banksy gets help from budding Michelangelos with Red Hook Art Project|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/red-hook-kids-pitch-bansky-article-1.1494689|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this was later debunked to have been the work of a group under the name Anonymous Guestbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cush|first=Andy|title=SORRY, THE "ANONYMOUS GUESTBOOK" ISN’T BANKSY|url=http://animalnewyork.com/2013/sorry-the-anonymous-guestbook-isnt-banksy/|work=Animal New York|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Waiting in Vain'' was the show's 24th installment. Located outside a [[strip club]] in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]], it illustrated a man in a [[tuxedo]] holding flowers, presumably jilted by his date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bucktin|first=Christopher|title=Banksy is back!

The 25th piece came suitably [[Halloween]]-themed. Located on the [[Bowery]], it exhibited a [[Grim Reaper]] riding a [[bumper car]] in circles to an elaborate light show, [[fog machine]] and [[Blue Öyster Cult]]'s "[[(Don't Fear) The Reaper]]."&lt;ref name=daily_reaper&gt;{{cite news|last=Stebner|first=Beth|title=Banksy on the Bowery: Artist debuts spooky Grim Reaper that thrills New Yorkers|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/banksy-bowery-artist-debuts-spooky-grim-reaper-article-1.1497493|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying audio guide offered a self-mocking interpretation, with Banksy stating that often "the role of art is to remind us of our mortality," implying that with this mounted art show that goes on "for so long we wish we were dead already."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dodero |first=Camille |title=Banksy's Newest NYC Installation: The Grim Reaper in a Bumper Car |url=http://gawker.com/banksys-newest-nyc-installation-the-grim-reaper-in-a-1452430639 |work=[[Gawker]] |accessdate=3 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030090617/http://gawker.com/banksys-newest-nyc-installation-the-grim-reaper-in-a-1452430639 |archivedate=30 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site of the exhibit was once that of an antique shop, some remains of which were placed in a coffin that occupied the lot for months. This prompted other interpretations of the installation's message, paying homage to the "ghosts of Bowry," as the antique store owner suggested.&lt;ref name=daily_reaper /&gt;

The 27 October piece was a message on a wall in Greenpoint that read "This site contains blocked messages." It made reference to an unpublished column Banksy had submitted to ''[[The New York Times]]''. The controversial essay criticized the city's decision in approving the [[One World Trade Center]], which he described as "vanilla" and looking like "something they would build in Canada."&lt;ref name=cnn_wtc&gt;{{cite news|last=Draznin|first=Haley|title=Banksy calls One World Trade Center a "betrayal"|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/28/us/banksy-world-trade-center-editorial/index.html|work=CNN|accessdate=3 November 2013|date=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moya-Smith|first=Simon|title=British street artist Banksy trashes design of One World Trade Center|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/27/21194968-british-street-artist-banksy-trashes-design-of-one-world-trade-center|work=[[NBC News]]|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In what became his second reference to the [[September 11 attacks]], Banksy argued the building was a betrayal to everyone who lost their lives that day, and that its blandness is a sign the terrorist won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simpson|first=Connor|title=Banksy Really Hates the New World Trade Center Building|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/10/banksy-really-hates-new-world-trade-center-building/70980/|work=[[The Atlantic Wire]]|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final piece of the month-long series was a group of balloons that together read "BANKSY!", tied to the wall of a building alongside the [[Long Island Expressway]] in Queens. Banksy included the message "Save [[5 Pointz|5pointz]]" in the caption for the piece on his website, referring to 5 Pointz, a nearby outdoor art exhibit considered to be a focal point of such culture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boyette|first=Chris|title=Banksy bids farewell to New York with balloons|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/31/us/new-york-banksy-residency-ends/|work=CNN|accessdate=3 November 2013|date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that had recently been approved by the [[New York City Department of City Planning]] to be [[5 Pointz#Demolition plans|demolished]] to make way for condominiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5Pointz Not Alone: City Planning Commission Also Approves Huge Hallets Point Project|url=http://queens.brownstoner.com/2013/08/the-city-planning-commission-votes-for-big-changes-in-queens-today/|work=brownstoner.com|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Bronx|Bronx]] [[Borough President]] [[Rubén Díaz, Jr.]] called Banksy a "modern-day Picasso" and praised him for choosing to unveil his 16 October Ronald McDonald replica in the South Bronx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carlson|first=Jen|title=Photos, Video: Banksy's New Piece Is A Traveling Ronald McDonald Statue|url=http://gothamist.com/2013/10/16/photos_ronald_mcdonald.php|work=Gothamist|accessdate=3 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019220758/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/16/photos_ronald_mcdonald.php|archivedate=19 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=daily_bronx2&gt;{{cite news|last=Scarborough|first=Joey|title=Borough President Ruben Diaz disses Banksy one day after ‘Ghetto 4 Life’ slur|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/bronx-borough-president-reviles-banksy-article-1.1493215|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came before Banksy's 21 October piece, which brought discontent to the President and other residents. The piece featured a child spray-painting the words "Ghetto 4 Life" on a wall. Díaz stated it reinforced "outdated negative stereotypes," and defended that Banksy should become aware that graffiti art and culture originated in the Bronx.&lt;ref name=independent_bronx /&gt;&lt;ref name=daily_bronx2 /&gt; The owner of the graffitied wall and his partner, however, praised the work and its message, calling it "beautiful" and owning its preservation to the artist's fame.&lt;ref name=daily_bronx /&gt;&lt;ref name=daily_bronx2 /&gt;

Banksy's [[op-ed]] article about One World Trade Center, posted on his website on 27 October, came as an insult to many across the city. Former [[FDNY]] Deputy Chief Jim Riches wrote that it was a "disgrace to New York City and all the families who lost loved ones on 9/11."&lt;ref name=cnn_wtc /&gt; [[Sally Regenhard]], a leading voice for families of [[Casualties of the September 11 attacks|11 September victims]], expressed concerns about Banksy's 15 October depiction of the Twin Towers in TriBeCa, saying the piece was "horrific" and that the placed flower looked more like an explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blau|first=Reuven|title=Banksy criticizes 1 World Trade Center as ‘Canadian,’ ‘vanilla’|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/banksy-disses-1-wtc-canadian-vanilla-article-1.1498564|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Century 21 (department store)|Century 21]] department store near [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] had planned to show Banksy's work on 29 October, but cancelled due to the controversy.&lt;ref name=cnn_wtc /&gt;

===Critical reception===
Banksy's ''Better Out Than In'' series has received mixed reviews.&lt;ref name=npr_review&gt;{{cite web|last=Rose|first=Joel|title=Art Or Act? New Yorkers Give Banksy Residency Mixed Reviews|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/10/31/242028452/art-or-act-banksys-reviews-are-mixed|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many fans raved over his work, flocking to each site everyday of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buckley|first=Cara|title=Monthlong Chase Around New York City for Banksy’s Street Art|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/29/nyregion/monthlong-chase-around-new-york-city-for-banksys-street-art.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=4 November 2013|date=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New York City|New York]]'' magazine art critic [[Jerry Saltz]] wrote Banksy's well-executed work stood out from other graffiti, but that the meaning behind the pieces aren't as deep as fans like to believe.&lt;ref name=npr_review /&gt; "No other graffiti artist has a [[Public relations|PR]] machine remotely like Banksy's," he writes, arguing Banksy is more of a "promo man" than an artist.&lt;ref name=saltz_ranking&gt;{{cite web|last=Saltz|first=Jerry|title=Jerry Saltz Ranks Banksy’s New York City (So-Called) Artistic Works|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/10/saltz-ranking-banksys-nyc-pieces.html|work=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]|publisher=[[New York Magazine]]|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Will Ellsworth-Jones, author of ''Banksy: The Man Behind the Wall'' writes that ''Better Out Than In'' shows Banksy's range of mediums has grown to incorporate multi-media and performance-based works. He pointed out the "wonderful commentary on money and art" displayed with hiring an anonymous salesman to sell Banksy paintings in Central Park for $60.&lt;ref name=npr_review /&gt;

The '''''Financial Times'' and McKinsey Bracken Bower Prize''' (or simply the '''''Bracken Bower Prize''''') is a prestigious annual award given to the best business book proposal of the year by a young business writer, as determined by the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and [[McKinsey &amp; Company]]. It aims to find the 'best proposal for a book about the challenges and opportunities of growth by an author aged under 35.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/0f9545a0-ecde-11e4-b82f-00144feab7de.pdf |title=Financial Times and McKinsey: The Bracken Bower Prize |work=Financial Times  |accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for films should be no longer than 700 words. --&gt;
In [[Medieval Scotland]], Princess Merida of the clan Dunbroch is given a bow and arrow by her father, King Fergus, for her sixth birthday to the dismay of her mother, Queen Elinor. While venturing into the woods to fetch a stray arrow, Merida encounters a [[will-o'-the-wisp]]. Soon afterward, Mor'du, a huge demon bear, attacks the family. Merida flees on horseback with Elinor, while Fergus and his men fend off Mor'du, though the fight costs him one of his legs.

Ten years later, Merida discovers that to her dismay, she is to be betrothed to the son of one of her father's allies. Reminding Merida of a legend of a prince whose pride and refusal to follow his father's wishes destroyed his kingdom, Elinor explains that failure to consent to the betrothal could harm Dunbroch.

The allied clan chieftains and their first-born sons arrive to compete in the [[Highland games]] for Merida's hand in marriage. Merida twists the rules, announcing that as her own clan's firstborn she is eligible to compete for her own hand. She easily bests her suitors in an archery contest, shaming the other clans. Later, she and Elinor argue and Merida leaves. After following the wisps to the hut of an elderly witch, Merida bargains with her for a spell to change her fate.

When Merida gives the spell, in the form of a cake, to Elinor, it causes Elinor to transform into a bear, unable to speak but still retaining most of her human consciousness. Merida returns to the witch's cottage with Elinor, only to find it deserted, and discovers a message from the witch: unless Merida is able to "mend the bond torn by pride" before the second sunrise, the spell will become permanent. Merida and Elinor are led by the wisps to ancient ruins, where they encounter Mor'du. Realizing that Mor'du was the prince in the legend, Merida vows that she will not let the same thing happen to her mother, and concludes she needs to repair the family tapestry she damaged during their argument.

They return to the castle to find the clans on the verge of war. Having learned from her experience with her mother, Merida intends to declare herself ready to choose a suitor as tradition demands, but with nonverbal encouragement from Elinor, instead insists that the first-borns should be allowed to marry in their own time to whomever they choose. The clans agree, breaking tradition but renewing and strengthening their alliance.

Merida sneaks into the tapestry room with Elinor. Elinor, who is losing her humanity, attacks Fergus, but suddenly regains her composure and flees the castle. Mistaking the queen for Mor'du and unwilling to listen to Merida, Fergus pursues the bear with the other clans, locking Merida in the castle. With the help of her younger triplet brothers, who also ate the cake and have been transformed into bear cubs, Merida escapes and repairs the tapestry while riding after her father. Fergus and the clans capture Elinor, but Merida intervenes and stops her father before Mor'du arrives. Mor'du batters the clan warriors and targets Merida, but Elinor intercedes, holding off Mor'du and causing him to be crushed by a falling [[menhir]]. This releases the [[spirit]] of the prince, who silently thanks Merida for freeing him. As the sun rises for the second time, Merida realizes the mistakes she has made and reconciles with Elinor, unknowingly fulfilling the real meaning of the witch's message, causing the queen and the princes to turn back into humans.

With Mor'du gone, Merida and Elinor work together on a new tapestry when they are called to the docks to bid farewell to the other clans, and ride their horses.

===Casting===
''Brave'' is the first [[List of Pixar films|Pixar film]] starring a female protagonist.&lt;ref name="Entertainment Weekly" /&gt; In that respect, ''Brave'' was followed by ''Inside Out'', ''Finding Dory'', and ''Incredibles 2'', all of whom featured female protagonists. Merida was originally to be voiced by [[Reese Witherspoon]], who declined due to scheduling issues. According to Andrews, she was on the project for "quite some time. She was getting her Scottish accent down, she was working very hard and it was sounding great but as we were continuing with the movie she had other movies lining up, so unfortunately we were unable to continue with her and had to get a replacement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reynolds|first1=Simon|title='Brave' preview: Mark Andrews on Pixar's Scotland-set fantasy tale|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/news/a374625/brave-preview-mark-andrews-on-pixars-scotland-set-fantasy-tale/|accessdate=January 15, 2017|work=Digital Spy|date=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the character was voiced by Scottish actress [[Kelly Macdonald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=John|title=Pixar's 'Brave': First Look art -- EXCLUSIVE PHOTOS|url=http://ew.com/article/2011/03/28/brave-pixar-first-look/|accessdate=January 15, 2017|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 28, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323224005/http://www.ew.com/article/2011/03/28/brave-pixar-first-look|archivedate=March 23, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, while promoting ''[[Sing (2016 American film)|Sing]]'', Witherspoon mentioned that she had to leave the film due to failure to master a Scottish accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Naomi|title=Reese Witherspoon admits she had to quit a movie because her Scottish accent was so bad|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/entertainment/news/a48739/reese-witherspoon-scottish-accent-quit-film/|accessdate=January 15, 2017|work=Cosmopolitan|date=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|Brave (soundtrack)}}
The score for ''Brave'' was composed by [[Patrick Doyle]] and performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. The orchestra was conducted by [[James Shearman]]. To bring some of Scotland's native flavor to the music, Doyle used traditional Celtic instruments such as [[bagpipes]], a solo [[fiddle]], [[Clàrsach|Celtic harps]], flutes and the [[bodhrán]], with an electronically treated [[Hammered dulcimer|dulcimer]] and [[cimbalom]] to give it a more contemporary feel.  "I employed many classic Scottish dance rhythms such as [[Reel (dance)|reels]], [[jig]]s, and [[Strathspey (dance)|strathspeys]], which not only serve the action but keep it authentic," said Doyle.&lt;ref name="Soundtrack"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Sounds Of The Highlands; Disney-Pixar's "Brave" Transports Moviegoers to Ancient Scotland with Oscar-Nominated Composer Patrick Doyle, Plus Performers Julie Fowlis and Birdy (with Mumford &amp; Sons)|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sounds-of-the-highlands-disney-pixars-brave-transports-moviegoers-to-ancient-scotland-with-oscar-nominated-composer-patrick-doyle-plus-performers-julie-fowlis-and-birdy-with-mumford--sons-152256415.html|accessdate=May 22, 2012|publisher=Walt Disney Records|date=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his research, he spent time in the Hebrides studying "unaccompanied [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] [[Hymnbooks of the Church of Scotland#Scots Metrical Psalter .281650.29|psalm singing]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cornwell|first=Tim|title=Scotland's Pixar tale hits the right note|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/Scotland39s-Pixar-tale-hits-the.6793996.jp?articlepage=1|accessdate=September 6, 2011|newspaper=[[The Scotsman]]|date=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doyle also composed several songs for the film. The lullaby duet between characters Princess Merida and Queen Elinor entitled "A Mhaighdean Uasal Bhan (Noble Maiden Fair)" appears on three occasions in different variations within the fabric of the score, and uniquely includes Gaelic vocals by Emma Thompson and Peigi Barker, the first Disney film with music featuring the language.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The drinking song "Song of Mor'du" (lyrics by Doyle and Steve Purcell) sung by [[Billy Connolly]], Scott Davies, [[Patrick Doyle]], Gordon Neville, [[Alex Norton]] and Carey Wilson, features a rich variety of words, sung authentically in [[Scots (language)|Scots]], which is distinct from Scottish Gaelic. (Scots being a Germanic language, while Scottish Gaelic is Celtic.)

In addition to Doyle's music, the film features three other original songs; "Learn Me Right" written by [[Mumford &amp; Sons]] and performed with [[Birdy (singer)|Birdy]], "Touch the Sky" (music by Alex Mandel, lyrics by Mark Andrews &amp; Mandel) and "Into the Open Air" (music and lyrics by Alex Mandel). Both "Touch the Sky" and "Into the Open Air" were performed by [[Julie Fowlis]], as Merida's off-screen musical thoughts. These two tracks were produced by composer and arranger Jim Sutherland, who is also featured as a performer.

Along with introducing Doyle to a number of specialist Celtic musicians who feature in the score, Sutherland was responsible for discovering the young Gaelic singer Peigi Barker; the voice of Young Merida.

[[Walt Disney Records]] released the soundtrack on both CD album and digital download on June 19, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amazon.com: Brave: Various Artists, Patrick Doyle, James Shearman: Music|url=https://www.amazon.com/Brave-Various-Artists/dp/B007XSFKAW| publisher = [[Amazon.com]] |accessdate = July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tartans===
[[File:DunBroch tartan.jpg|thumb|Clan DunBroch tartan, [[Scottish Tartans Authority|STA]] 10641]]

Pixar created three original [[tartan]] patterns for the film for three of the four clans – DunBroch, Dingwall, and MacGuffin. (Clan Macintosh wears a red tartan similar to the nonfictional [[Clan Mackintosh]].)

[[The Walt Disney Company]] registered the Clan DunBroch tartan with the official [[Scottish Register of Tartans]] upon release of the film. The tartan consists of ocean blue for the [[North Sea]], subdued scarlet for bloodshed during the clan wars, deep green for the [[Scottish Highlands]], navy blue for the eventual unity of the four clans, and gray for the Scottish people. In selecting the color scheme, Pixar took historical considerations, stating that "[t]here was a concerted effort to use hues that were indicative of the less saturated dyeing techniques [used] during the [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages|ancient period]] in which the fantasy film is set."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tartanregister.gov.uk/tartanDetails.aspx?ref=10641|title=Tartan Details - The Scottish Register of Tartans|first=National Records of|last=Scotland|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The registration was celebrated at the film's British premiere in [[Edinburgh]], where Scottish First Minister [[Alex Salmond]] presented a certificate to director Mark Andrews. However, Member of the Scottish Parliament [[Alex Johnstone]] criticized the registration (as well as other fiction-based entries such as one for [[Peter Rabbit]]) as "shallow and irreverent." Mr. Johnstone contended that the 2008 legislation that created The Scottish Register of Tartans was intended to prevent such entries and protect Scotland's heritage.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.deadlinenews.co.uk/2013/01/03/scottish-register-of-tartans-criticised-over-approving-disney-designs/ Scottish Register of Tartans criticized after approving Disney designs]". ''Deadline.''. January 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Box office===
''Brave'' earned $237.3 million in North America, and $303.2 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $540.4 million.&lt;ref name="box-mojo" /&gt; It was the 13th highest-grossing film of 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&amp;yr=2012&amp;p=.htm|title=2012 Yearly Box Office Results - Box Office Mojo|work=boxofficemojo.com|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the eighth highest-grossing Pixar film,&lt;ref name="Pixar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=pixar.htm|title=Pixar|work=boxofficemojo.com|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the third highest-grossing animated film that year behind ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' ($875.3 million) and ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' ($746.9 million).

In North America, pre-release tracking suggested the film would open between $55&amp;nbsp;million to $65&amp;nbsp;million in North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/brave-abraham-lincoln-vampire-hunter-box-office-340776|title=Box Office Preview: 'Brave' to Slay 'Abraham Lincoln' With About $60 Million|first=Pamela|last=McClintock|date=June 21, 2012|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/22/business/la-fi-ct-projector-20120622|title='Brave' expected to easily defeat 'Abraham Lincoln' at box office|first=Amy|last=Kaufman|date=June 22, 2012|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is slightly below average for a Pixar film,&lt;ref name="BOM-forecast" /&gt; as trackers initially suggested that as a "princess story", the film might not appeal as much to male audiences.&lt;ref name="BOM-forecast" /&gt;

It opened on June 22, 2012, with $24.6&amp;nbsp;million and finished its opening weekend with $66.3&amp;nbsp;million (the same amount as ''Cars 2'', Pixar's previous film), at the upper end of the numbers analysts predicted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=daily&amp;id=bearandthebow.htm "Brave (2012){{spaced ndash}} Daily Box Office Results"].

===Critical response===
''Brave'' received a 79% approval rating on the review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on reviews from 237 critics, with an average rating of 7/10. The site's critical consensus reads: "''Brave'' offers young audiences and fairy tale fans a rousing, funny fantasy adventure with a distaff twist and surprising depth."&lt;ref name="RotTotBrave"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/brave_2012/|title=Brave (2012)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another review aggregator, [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Normalization (statistics)|normalized]] rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 69 based on 37 reviews, or "generally favorable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/brave|title=Brave Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was well-received among American audiences, earning an "A", according to [[CinemaScore]].&lt;ref name="wrap-weekend" /&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. He wrote, "The good news is that the kids will probably love it, and the bad news is that parents will be disappointed if they're hoping for another Pixar groundbreaker. Unlike such brightly original films as ''[[Toy Story]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'', and ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'', this one finds Pixar poaching on traditional territory of Disney." He said that the film did have an uplifting message about improving communication between mothers and daughters, "although transforming your mother into a bear is a rather extreme first step".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brave|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120620/REVIEWS/120629997|accessdate=June 21, 2012|author=Roger Ebert|authorlink=Roger Ebert|date=June 20, 2012|work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Debruge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave a positive review of the film,  writing that the film "offers a tougher, more self-reliant heroine for an era in which princes aren't so charming, set in a sumptuously detailed Scottish environment, where her spirit blazes bright as her fiery red hair".  Debruge said that "adding a female director, [[Brenda Chapman]], to its creative boys' club, the studio [[Pixar]] has fashioned a resonant tribute to mother-daughter relationships that packs a level of poignancy on par with such beloved male-bonding classics as ''Finding Nemo''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117947728 |title=Brave|last=Debruge|first=Peter|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=June 11, 2012|date=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, [[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave it a negative review, stating that the film "diminishes into a rather wee thing as it chugs along, with climactic drama that is both too conveniently wrapped up and hinges on magical elements that are somewhat confusing to boot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/brave-review-disney-pixar-335633|title=Brave: Film Review|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=June 10, 2012|accessdate=June 11, 2012 | authorlink = Todd McCarthy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Maltin]] on ''[[IndieWire]]'' said, "I'll give it points for originality, but that story twist is so bizarre that it knocked me for a loop. The movie tries to make up for this detour with a heart-tugging, emotional finale, but the buildup to that moment has been undermined, so it doesn’t have the impact it should."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.indiewire.com/leonardmaltin/bravemovie-review |author= Maltin, Leonard |authorlink= Leonard Maltin |date= June 2012 |title= ''Brave—movie review'' |publisher= [[IndieWire]] |accessdate= May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reviewers saw the Merida character as a novel break from the traditional line of [[Disney Princess|Disney princesses]].  There were some dissonance and criticism among viewers and organized feminists when her character was scheduled to be "crowned" a Disney princess, only for artists to render her thinner, with less frizzy hair, and rounder eyes, more like the other princesses from previous Disney movies. This inspired girl-empowerment website A Mighty Girl to file a petition that Disney not alter their character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amightygirl.com/blog/?p=3253|title=Say No to the Merida Makeover and Keep Our Hero Brave!|publisher=A Mighty Girl|accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=June|first=Daniel|title="Brave’s" Merida Gets a Makeover, Upsetting Feminists and Others|url=http://www.jdjournal.com/2013/05/10/braves-merida-gets-a-makeover-upsetting-feminists-and-others/|accessdate=May 12, 2013|newspaper=JD Journal|date=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the 262,196 signatories was Brenda Chapman, the director of the film, who felt that Disney had "betrayed the essence of what we were trying to do with Merida&amp;nbsp;— give young girls and women a better, stronger role model",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Melissa|first=Silverstein|title=Brave Director Brenda Chapman Responds to Merida Coronation|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/womenandhollywood/brave-director-brenda-chapman-responds-to-merida-coronation#|accessdate=May 14, 2013|newspaper=IndieWire|date=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the makeover was "a blatantly sexist marketing move based on money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Liberatore|first=Paul|title='Brave' creator blasts Disney for 'blatant sexism' in princess makeover|url=http://www.marinij.com/millvalley/ci_23224741/brave-creator-blasts-disney-blatant-sexism-princess-makeover|accessdate=May 14, 2013|newspaper=Marin Independent Journal|date=May 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The online petition was considered a success, as shortly after it appeared Disney removed the redesigned image from their official website, in favor of Merida's original film appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Disney-Pulls-Merida-Makeover-Outcry-37551.html|title = CinemaBlend.com|last = |first = |date = May 15, 2013|work = Disney Pulls Merida's Makeover After Outcry|accessdate = September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney later clarified the situation, assuring that Merida would remain in her original form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidethemagic.net/2013/05/exclusive-disney-bravely-responds-to-merida-makeover-outrage-says-2d-new-look-was-for-limited-use-only/ Exclusive: Disney bravely responds to Merida makeover outrage, says 2D new look was for "limited" use only] Retrieved May 24, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bahr |first=Lindsey |url=http://family-room.ew.com/2013/05/15/brave-merida-makeover/ |title='Brave': Merida remains the girl you know and love - EXCLUSIVE &amp;#124; The Family Room &amp;#124; EW.com |publisher=Family-room.ew.com |date=May 15, 2013 |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2224">The '''Contemporary Art Research Centre''' is a Research Centre within the Department of Fine Art, Kingston University, England. The founding Directors are Louis Nixon and Elizabeth Price, and the Director from 2016 is Mandy Ure . The stated ethos of the centre specifically refers to the research of [[André Breton]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[We aim] to build and provide an intellectual and creative milieu for innovation in contemporary fine art. Taking its identity from André Breton's articulation of the imagination it [The Centre] draws on the legacy of surrealism to imagine and enact possibilities of contemporary art in contingency with social politics, technology, models of knowledge and modes of experience. In the essay ''Once Upon a Time'' [Il était une fois] Breton argues for the transformative power of the imagination, that it may be applied instrumentally to change circumstances yet is also excessive to utility, absurd and radically profane. The Centre aims to house this rich range of useful/less imaginative invention. Conceits of newness do not distract us, but resourceful adaptations, hybrids, mutations, and détournement, as well as attention to the realm of the overlooked, the scatological and absurd promise of stuff, recognised through play—these things are cultivated here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fada.kingston.ac.uk//research/car/car.php Louis Nixon and Elizabeth Price, CARC webpage, accessed on 16 February, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[fiction]], '''canon''' is the material accepted as officially part of the story in the [[fictional universe]] of that story. It is often contrasted with, or used as the basis for, works of [[fan fiction]]. The alternative terms '''mythology''', '''timeline''', '''universe''' and '''continuity''' are often used, with the former being especially used to refer to a richly detailed fictional canon requiring a large degree of [[suspension of disbelief]] (e.g. an entire imaginary world and history), while the latter two typically refer to a single arc where all events are directly connected chronologically. Other times, the word can mean "to be acknowledged by the creator(s)".

==Origin==
The use of the word "canon" originated in reference to a set of texts derives from [[Biblical canon]], the set of books regarded as [[scripture]], as contrasted with non-canonical [[Apocrypha]].{{sfn|McDonald|2007|p=38}} The term was first used by analogy in the context of fiction to refer to the [[Canon of Sherlock Holmes|Sherlock Holmes stories and novels]], written by [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], as contrasted with numerous Holmes adventures added later by other writers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} This usage was afterwards extended to the writings of various other authors.

The term "canon" nowadays refers to all works of fiction within a franchise's fictional universe which are considered "to have actually happened" within the fictional universe they belong to.

==Canonicity==
When there are multiple "official" works or original media, the question of what is canonical can be unclear. This is resolved either by explicitly excluding certain media from the status of canon (as in the case of ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''), by assigning different levels of canonicity to different media (as was in the case of ''Star Wars'' before the franchise was purchased by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]), by considering different but licensed media treatments official and equally canonical to the series timeline within their own [[Continuity (fiction)|continuities]] universe, but not across them, or not resolved at all. The use of canon is of particular importance with regard to [[Reboot (fiction)|reboots]] or re-imaginings of established franchises, such as the ''Star Trek'' remake (2009), because of the ways in which it influences the viewer experience.{{sfn|Urbanski|2013|p=83}}

The official ''[[Star Trek]]'' website describes [[Star Trek canon|''Star Trek'' canon]] as "the events that take place within the episodes and movies" (that is, the television series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', and the [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' film series]], with ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' having long existed in a [[Star Trek: The Animated Series#Canon issues|nebulous gray area of canonicity]]).&lt;ref name="trek"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/help/faqs/faq/676.html |title=FAQ: Article |date=10 July 2003 |work=startrek.com |publisher=CBS Studios |accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events, characters and storylines from tie-in novels, comic books, and video games are explicitly excluded from the ''Star Trek'' canon, but the site notes that elements from these sources have been subsequently introduced into the television series, and says that "canon is not something set in stone."&lt;ref name="trek" /&gt; One example of a non-canonical element that later became canonical in the Star Trek universe were the first names for [[Hikaru Sulu|Sulu]] and [[Uhura]], introduced in novels, plus "Tiberius" becoming the official middle name of Enterprise captain [[James T. Kirk]]. The name was introduced in the ''Star Trek'' animated series, and was later added into the official biography of the character by its mention in the live-action film ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'' (1991).

The [[Star Wars canon|''Star Wars'' canon]] originally existed on several levels. The highest level was the original ''Star Wars'' films, and statements by [[George Lucas]]; tie-in fiction from the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] had a different level of canonicity.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news |title=Meet Leland Chee, the Star Wars Franchise Continuity Cop |first=Chris |last=Baker |url=https://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/magazine/16-09/ff_starwarscanon?currentPage=all |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]  |date=18 August 2008 |accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex system was maintained by Leland Chee, a [[Lucasfilm]] employee.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt; After Disney bought the franchise, all material published prior to April 25, 2014 that was not any of the Star Wars movies or the CGI cartoon ''The Clone Wars'' was declared in the "Legends" continuity, marking them as no longer official canon. All subsequent material exists on the same level of canon, with the Lucasfilm Story Group being established to ensure no contradictions among canon works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page|title=The Legendary Star Wars Expanded Universe Turns a New Page|work=StarWars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The makers of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' have generally avoided making pronouncements about canonicity, with [[Russell T Davies]] explaining that he does not think about the concept for the ''Doctor Who'' television series or its [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-offs]].&lt;ref&gt;Doctor Who Magazine #388&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doctor Who Magazine #356&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies RT, "The Writer's Tales"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canon as distinguishing between original works and later additions==
In literature, the term "canon" is used to distinguish between the original works of a writer who created certain characters and/or settings, and the later works of other writers who took up the same characters or setting. For example, the [[canon of Sherlock Holmes]] consists of the 56 [[short story|short stories]] and four [[novel]]s written by [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] and featuring the detective [[Sherlock Holmes]].&lt;ref name="Doyle 1993"&gt;Peter Haining, "Introduction" in {{cite book | last = Doyle | first = Arthur Conan | title = The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble Books | location = New York | year = 1993 | isbn = 1-56619-198-X }} Edited by Peter Haining.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Sherlock Holmes pastiches|subsequent works]] by other authors who took up Sherlock Holmes are considered "non-canonical".

==Fanon==
&lt;!-- [[Fanon]] links to this section --&gt;
[[Fan fiction]] is almost never regarded as canonical. However, certain ideas may become influential or widely accepted within fan communities, who refer to such ideas as "fanon", a [[portmanteau]] of ''fan'' and ''canon''.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parrish|2007|p=33}}: 'fanon.' Within an individual fandom, certain plotlines may be reinvented so many times and by so many people—or alternately may be written so persuasively by a few writers—that they take on the status of fan-produced canon.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first known use of the word fanon was by [[Emily Salzfass]] in [https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!original/alt.startrek.creative.erotica.moderated/x4ZMX4jeQG4/FeEBn8gPjYgJ a post about Star Trek] at [[alt.startrek.creative.erotica.moderated]] on April 1, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the jargon "headcanon" is used to describe a fan's personal interpretation of a fictional universe.

[[File:Cavetto cornice.svg|thumb|Cavetto moulding]]
[[File:Chapel of Amenhotep II cavetto.jpg|thumb|Cavetto cornice above torus on the "Chapel of [[Amenhotep II]]" at [[Karnak]], 15th century BC]]

A '''cavetto''' is a [[wikt:concave#Adjective|concave]] [[molding (decorative)|moulding]] with a regular curved profile that is part of a circle, widely used in [[architecture]] as well as [[furniture]], [[picture frame]]s, metalwork and other [[decorative arts]]. In describing vessels and similar shapes in [[pottery]], metalwork and related fields, "cavetto" may be used of a variety of concave curves running round objects.  The word comes from Italian, as a diminutive of ''cave'', from the Latin for "hollow" (it is the same root as [[cave]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Cavetto"&lt;/ref&gt;  A vernacular alternative is "cove", most often used where interior walls curve at the top to make a transition to the roof, or for "upside down" cavettos at the bases of elements.&lt;ref&gt;"coving" is also a word for all types of interior mouldings&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cavetto moulding is the opposite of the [[wikt:convex#Adjective|convex]], bulging, [[ovolo]], which is equally common in the tradition of Western [[classical architecture]]. Both bring the surface forward, and are often combined with other elements of moulding.  Usually they include a curve through about a quarter-circle (90°).&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 124&lt;/ref&gt;  A concave moulding of about a full semi-circle is known as a "scotia".&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 132, 125&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a minor element of decoration in [[classical architecture]], the prominent '''cavetto cornice''' is a common feature of the ancient architecture of Egypt and the [[Ancient Near East]].

==Architecture==
[[Ancient Egyptian architecture]] made especial use of large cavetto mouldings as a [[cornice]], with only a short fillet (plain vertical face) above, and a [[Molding_(decorative)#Types|torus]] moulding (convex semi-circle) below.  This cavetto cornice is sometimes also known as an "Egyptian cornice", "hollow and roll" or "gorge cornice", and has been suggested to be a reminiscence in stone architecture of the primitive use of bound bunches of reeds as supports for buildings, the weight of the roof bending their tops out.&lt;ref&gt;Brier, Bob, Hobbs, A. Hoyt, ''Daily Life of the Ancient Egyptians'', p. 200, 2008, Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|0313353069}}, 9780313353062, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h1LsCh68d7kC&amp;pg=PA200 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Egyptian Building.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Egyptian Building]] (1845) in [[Richmond, Virginia]], with massive cavetto cornice and bell capitals]]

Many types of Egyptian capitals for columns are essentially cavettos running round the shaft, often with added decoration. These include the types known as "bell capitals" or "[[papyrus]] capitals".  These features are often reproduced in [[Egyptian Revival architecture]], as in the [[Egyptian Building]] (1845) in [[Richmond, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bluffton.edu/homepages/facstaff/sullivanm/virginia/richmond/egyptblding/medicalcollege.html Medical College of Richmond (now Egyptian Building, Medical College of Virginia)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cavetto cornice, often forming less than a quarter-circle, influenced Egypt's neighbours and as well as appearing in early Greek architecture, it is seen in Syria and [[ancient Iran]], for example at the [[Tachara]] palace of [[Darius I]] at [[Persepolis]], completed in 486 BC.  Inspired by this precedent, it was then revived by [[Ardashir I]] (r. 224–41 AD), the founder of the [[Sasanian dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Collon, et al. "Iran, ancient, II, 3." Grove Art Online, [[Oxford Art Online]], Oxford University Press, accessed January 5, 2017, [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T041472 subscription required]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cavetto took the place of the Greek [[cymatium]] in many [[Etruscan architecture|Etruscan]] temples, often painted with vertical "tongue" patterns, and combined with the distinctive "Etruscan round moulding", often painted with scales.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, 61–67; [[:File:Villa Giulia ricostruzione del tempio etrusco 01.JPG|Example in the reconstructed Etruscan temple]] at [[Villa Giulia]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Tachara, Persepolis.jpg|thumb|The [[Tachara]] palace of [[Darius I]] at [[Persepolis]], completed in 486 BC]]

This emphasis on the cavetto was very different from its role in mature [[Ancient Greek architecture]], where cavetto elements were relatively small and subordinated to essentially vertical elements, setting the style for the subsequent Western classical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Margaret M., ''A Companion to Greek Architecture'', 2016, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|1444335995}}, 9781444335996, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lvAGCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Often an essentially cavetto section is heavily decorated, in [[Gothic architecture]] often smothering the shape beneath.  

In general the Greeks made much more use of the cyma moulding, where a cavetto and ovolo were placed one above the other to produce a "S" shape; the [[cymatium]] using this was a standard part of the cornice in the classical [[Ionic order]], and often used elsewhere.  There are two forms, depending on which curve is uppermost: in the ''cyma recta'' the cavetto is on top, in the ''cyma reversa'' the ovolo. A cavetto alone was sometimes employed in the place of the cymatium of a cornice, as in the [[Doric order]] of the [[Theatre of Marcellus]] in Rome, one of the standard models for revived [[classical architecture]] from the Renaissance onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Perrault, 113&lt;/ref&gt;   But small cavetto mouldings were normal at various places, including integrated ones, not distinguished as a distinct zone by lines or borders, at the bottom of the shaft of columns, beginning the transition to the wider base.  These are called an [[apophyge]], or "concave sweep".&lt;ref&gt;See labelled diagrams at Summerson, 124–126&lt;/ref&gt;   

[[Claude Perrault]], the architect of [[Louis XIV]]'s [[Perrault's Colonnade|rebuilding]] of the [[Louvre Palace]], explained in his architectural textbook ''Ordonnance for the five kinds of columns after the method of the Ancients'' (1683) why he had replaced a cavetto with a cyma in his illustration of the Doric capital: "a cavetto is not as strong and is more readily broken than the other molding".&lt;ref&gt;Perrault, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

The cavetto is demarcated by pairs of thin blue lines, and has [[running scroll]] decoration, different to that on either side of it in the flat middle and rim.]] 
In plates and other flattish shapes, ''cavetto'' is used for the curving area linking the base and the rim. This is the case whether the rim is a broad flat surface (typical 20th century Western plate), or merely the edge of the cavetto (typical modern cereal bowl).  Normally the term refers to the top surface of the vessel; if the underside is meant (where the curve is now convex), that may be described as "under the cavetto", "under-cavetto" and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;N. S. Brommelle, Perry Smith (eds), ''Urushi: Proceedings of the Urushi Study Group, June 10–27, 1985, Tokyo'', pp. 17–18, 1988, Getty Publications, {{ISBN|0892360968}}, 9780892360963, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uo5OAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170 fully online]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cavetto is very often left undecorated, but may have decoration of a different sort from the middle or a flat rim, and the term is typically used when it is necessary to describe this.  In complicated pottery shapes, where the normal vocabulary of mouldings is appropriate, cavetto may be used in that sense for any concave curving section.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ec8ejUxhfVwC&amp;pg=PA44 Hellenistic Pottery and Terracottas''], By Homer A. Thompson et al., examples B42 and B43&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the terminology of [[archaeology]], especially relating to pottery (and generally not used of pottery after antiquity, or outside archaeology), a cavetto zone or cavetto is a "sharp concavity encircling the body of a vessel", and also a "deep but narrow neck", both used in relation to mainly upright vessels for storing or cooking food.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 120 (quoted); [https://collectionsprojects.org.uk/archaeology/Prehistoric%20Pottery%20Project/glossary-glossary.html Glossary, Tyne &amp; Wear Museums] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203201900/http://collectionsprojects.org.uk/archaeology/Prehistoric%20Pottery%20Project/glossary-glossary.html |date=February 3, 2016 }}, with illustration; see the table of British Food Vessel types [http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/5192/1/Wilkin14PhD_Redacted.pdf at p. 124 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cindy Campbell''' is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] from the ''[[Scary Movie (film series)|Scary Movie]]'' franchise. Portrayed by [[Anna Faris]] and created by [[Shawn Wayans]], [[Marlon Wayans]], Buddy Johnson, Phil Beauman, [[Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer|Jason Friedberg]] and [[Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer|Aaron Seltzer]], the character first appeared in ''[[Scary Movie]]'' (2000). In the film, whose main parodies are the ''[[Scream (franchise)|Scream]]'' and ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' franchises, Cindy shares a role similar to [[Sidney Prescott]] and Julie James.

Faris would reprise her role of Cindy in the film's sequels. In ''[[Scary Movie 2]]'', Cindy is attending college and with her friends, goes to Hell House for Professor Oldman's experiment. Here, her role is based on Eleanor from ''[[The Haunting (1999 film)|The Haunting]]''. In ''[[Scary Movie 3]]'', where her role is based on [[Rachel Keller]] from ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'', she is portrayed as a news presenter and has a nephew, Cody. After seeing Tabitha's cursed tape, she tries to stop her before seven days pass and she dies. In ''[[Scary Movie 4]]'', Cindy parodies [[Karen Davis (The Grudge)|Karen Davis]] from ''[[The Grudge]]'' and attempts to stop the alien attack with the help of Brenda.

Up until the fourth installment, Faris and [[Regina Hall]], who portrayed Brenda Meeks, were the only cast members to appear in every installment of the franchise. Faris didn't return for ''[[Scary Movie 5]]'' and Cindy was replaced by [[Ashley Tisdale]]'s character; Jody Sanders. Critical response to Faris' portrayal has been positive.

==Appearances==
===''Scary Movie''===
Cindy is a high school student attending B. A. Corpse High School with her boyfriend Bobby Prinze. Their friends include Brenda Meeks, Buffy Gilmore, Ray Wilkins and Greg Phillipe. Despite being in a committed relationship with Bobby, the two of them still haven't consummated their relationship. Following Drew Decker's death, it's revealed that one year prior, the six of them had accidentally ran over a man while drinking. While the man was unharmed, they didn't notice and after accidentally knocking him unconscious, dumped his body at a pier. Later the same day, she notices [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] outside her classroom and a note on her desk telling her that "they know what she did last Halloween". After being attacked by Ghostface, she assumes that Bobby is the killer and gets him arrested. After the real killer calls her, she decides to invite her friends to keep each other safe. Thanks to Shorty, the small get-together turns into a party. After having sex with Bobby, it's revealed that he is gay and in a relationship with Ray. Despite killing Shorty, they reveal to her that they're copycats of the real killer who appears and kills both of them. After knocking him out, Cindy is taken to the police station where she realizes Doofy, Buffy's brother, is the killer. Despite running after him, Doofy manages to escape, leaving Cindy screaming in the middle of the street, only to get ran over by a car.

===''Scary Movie 2''===
One year after the events of the previous film, Cindy is attending college with Brenda, Shorty and Ray, despite all three of them having died in the previous film and the latter having tried to kill her.

===''Scary Movie 3''===
Now a journalist, Cindy has custody of her paranormally gifted nephew, Cody. She again meets Brenda, now a teacher. Unnerved, Brenda asks Cindy to stay with her for the night, when she says she watched a cursed tape. Brenda is murdered by a supernatural girl named Tabitha after failing to turn off the TV. Cindy goes after the answer to the curse of the tape, discovering that aliens are also involved, all while trying to protect Cody and her new friends, Logan, his daughter and Cindy's love interest, George. After breaking the curse, she marries George.

==Development==
===Parody and inspiration===
In ''[[Scary Movie]]'', Cindy is a parody of [[Sidney Prescott]] from ''[[Scream (franchise)|Scream]]'' and Julie James from ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]''. Her first name is a play on Sidney, while her last name is taken from [[Neve Campbell]], who portrayed Sidney in the ''Scream'' franchise.&lt;ref name="Hallenbeck"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hallenbeck |first1=Bruce G. |title=Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914–2008 |date=May 13, 2009 |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]] |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |isbn=978-0786433322 |page=195 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting and portrayal===
In an interview with ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', it was revealed that [[Anna Faris]] beat out about hundreds of actresses who auditioned for the role of Cindy. [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]], director of the first two films, said about Faris that "there was a great freshness about her, because [she] had nothing to lose. She didn't think in a million years she was going to get the part".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wulff |first1=Jennifer |title=Scream Queen |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20134940,00.html |magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]] |accessdate=August 24, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120529185225/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20134940,00.html |archivedate=May 29, 2012 |date=July 23, 2001 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faris revealed that ''Scary Movie'' was her first Hollywood audition and that she highly enjoyed working on the franchise as it allowed her to be funny, feeling that female characters aren't often allowed to be funny in films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scary Movie 4 - Anna Faris interview |url=http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/scary-movie-4-anna-faris-interview |website=Indie London |accessdate=August 24, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824110514/http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/scary-movie-4-anna-faris-interview |archivedate=August 24, 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, she stated that one of the things she like about the franchise is that "[they] can spoof whatever [they want,] take what's popular at the moment and slide it into a very complicated plot structure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Krug |first1=Kurt Anthony |title=Edmonds actress having fun with "Scary" movies, growing career |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2002943211_faris21.html |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=August 24, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20110804220128/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2002943211_faris21.html |archivedate=August 4, 2011 |date=April 21, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Bruce G. Hallenbeck, in his book ''Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914–2008'', described Faris as "the real discovery of ''Scary Movie'', the one performer who tries valiantly to hold everything together".&lt;ref name="Hallenbeck"/&gt;

'''Commercial graffiti''' (also known as '''aerosol advertising''' or '''graffiti for hire''') is the commercial practice of [[graffiti]] artists being paid for their work. In [[New York City]] in particular, commercial graffiti is big business and since the 1980s has manifested itself in many of the major cities of Europe such as [[London]], [[Paris]] and [[Berlin]]. Increasingly it has been used to promote video games and even feature prominently within them, reflecting a real life struggle between street artists and the law. Commercial graffiti has created significant controversy between those who view it as an effective medium of advertising amongst specific target audiences and those who believe that legal graffiti and advertising using it encourages illegal graffiti and crime.

Graffiti as a commercial activity dates back to [[Ancient Greece]],&lt;ref name="Kipfer2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kipfer|first=Barbara Ann|title=Dictionary of artifacts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0dSbxl_MjZwC&amp;pg=PA132|accessdate=30 December 2010|year=2007|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-1887-3|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MorganTsetskhladze2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=Catherine|last2=Tsetskhladze|first2=Gocha R.|title=Attic fine pottery of the archaic to Hellenistic periods in Phanagoria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_g74RsWPeXkC&amp;pg=PA150|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=September 2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-13888-9|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; when pottery makers employed artists to decorate their items with motifs and intricate designs.&lt;ref name="Morris1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Ian|title=Classical Greece: ancient histories and modern archaeologies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fnJvha8jzzQC&amp;pg=PA104|accessdate=30 December 2010|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-45678-4|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern era, the phenomenon has been strongly associated with [[New York City]] since the late 1960s and the [[hip hop culture]] that emerged in the 1980s, according to a 1993 ''[[New York Times]]'' article that focused on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/style/too-legit-to-quit.html?scp=484&amp;sq=&amp;st=nyt&amp;pagewanted=1|title=Too Legit to Quit|first=Michel|last=Marriott|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=October 3, 1993|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "commercial graffiti" was used in an article by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as early as 1968 and used to describe activity in [[Chicago]] as early as 1970.&lt;ref name="HoffmannBailey1990"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoffmann|first1=Frank W.|last2=Bailey|first2=William G.|title=Arts &amp; entertainment fads|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaAqgBIceEIC&amp;pg=PA164|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=23 July 1990|publisher=Harrington Park Press|isbn=978-0-918393-72-2|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Humanists1970"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fellowship of Religious Humanists|title=Religious humanism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G7MpAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=30 December 2010|year=1970|publisher=Fellowship of Religious Humanists.|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, [[Times Square]] was referenced as featuring "commercial graffiti" through "Japanization", and more recently{{when|date=May 2011}} further "Japanization" of children's culture is cited to be taking place through forms of graffiti in video games and in the increasing popularity of Japanese innovations such as [[anime]].&lt;ref name="LLC1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=New York Media, LLC|title=New York Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7uUCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=17 August 1981|publisher=New York Media, LLC|page=17|issn=0028-7369}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="West2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=West|first=Mark I.|title=The Japanification of children's popular culture: from godzilla to miyazaki|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RDfaAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=30 December 2010|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5121-4|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1980s, commercial graffiti has evidenced itself in [[Los Angeles]]&lt;ref name="Price2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Vincent Barrett|title=Albuquerque: a city at the end of the world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X-MzbiOCmNUC&amp;pg=PR13|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=18 April 2003|publisher=UNM Press|isbn=978-0-8263-3097-0|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other major American cities&lt;ref name="BrodkinPearson1975"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brodkin|first1=Sylvia Z.|last2=Pearson|first2=Elizabeth J.|title=Native voices: a collection of modern essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4ZjY5De-qAC|accessdate=30 December 2010|year=1975|publisher=Globe Book Co.|isbn=978-0-87065-176-2|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; and across Europe, particularly [[Paris]], and [[London]] and [[Berlin]] and features on the walls of numerous galleries across Europe.&lt;ref name="College2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=New Europe College|title=New Europe College regional program yearbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8o_sAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=1 January 2003|publisher=New Europe College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increasing popularity and legitimization of graffiti, it has increasingly undergone commercialization. In 2001, computer giant [[IBM]] launched an advertising campaign in Chicago and San Francisco which involved people spray painting on sidewalks a [[peace symbol]], a [[Heart (symbol)|heart]], and a [[penguin]] ([[Linux]] mascot), to represent "Peace, Love, and Linux." However, due to illegalities some of the street artists were arrested and charged with vandalism, and IBM was fined more than US$120,000 for punitive and clean-up costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher = CNN|title = IBM's graffiti ads run afoul of city officials|url = http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/industry/04/19/ibm.guerilla.idg/index.html |date= April 19, 2001|accessdate = 30 December 2010|first=James|last=Niccolai}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite web|publisher = Wired|title = Sony Draws Ire With PSP Graffiti|url = https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2005/12/69741|date = December 5, 2005|accessdate =30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
[[File:Painted truck paris jnl 1.jpg|thumb|right|Commercial graffiti on a truck in Paris]]
The practice of commercial artistry is controversial,&lt;ref name="Eskilson2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eskilson|first=Stephen|title=Graphic design: a new history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HdExAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=30 December 2010|year=2007|publisher=Laurence King|isbn=978-1-85669-512-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; because many commercial establishments feel that professional graffiti art is a valuable form of advertising, while other businesses, law enforcement and others disagree. Legal and commercial graffiti is increasing and has created significant debate amongst graffiti writers and those associated with hip-hop culture.&lt;ref name="Iveson2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Iveson|first=Kurt|title=Publics and the city|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wBiUnIeAIsMC&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=30 December 2010|year=2007|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-2730-1|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary concern by those who oppose graffiti is that the tolerance of professional graffiti in one space leads to more illegal graffiti in other spaces. In some areas such as sports, over advertising in sports venues and even player uniforms in soccer has sometimes been viewed negatively.&lt;ref name="MurrayMurray1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Bill|last2=Murray|first2=William J.|title=The world's game: a history of soccer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CRkIAcCB_0EC&amp;pg=PA159|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=1 January 1998|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-06718-1|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial graffiti, seen as a frontier between the street world and the art world,&lt;ref name="Pereira2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pereira|first=Sandrine|title=Graffiti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RBeftQGRSI8C&amp;pg=PA104|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=25 May 2005|publisher=Silverback Books|isbn=978-2-7528-0181-4|pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; is argued in some cases to promote a more responsible lifestyle for the graffiti artist through formal employment, which may range from actual graffiti advertising on buildings, to making prints and logos for clothing and gallery showcasing.&lt;ref name="Macdonald2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Macdonald|first=Nancy|title=The graffiti subculture: youth, masculinity, and identity in London and New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZnQg77NzxoC&amp;pg=PA90|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=4 September 2001|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-333-78190-6|pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy MacDonland in her book ''The graffiti subculture: youth, masculinity, and identity in London and New York'' argues that commercial graffiti artistry "moves writers out of the boundaries of the subculture", because artists "no longer paint for their peers and themselves, they have a new audience".&lt;ref name="Macdonald2001"/&gt;

Even in major cities such as New York City and Chicago, commercial graffiti has created some very mixed reactions. For instance in Chicago, despite a significant following in graffiti artistry, in the mid 1980s a commercial which featured a kid spraying "The end is near" caused considerable outrage by Chicago citizens who protested to the [[Ford Motor Company]] to take the commercial off air as they believed it encouraged children to freely graffiti property as they desire.&lt;ref name="Company1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johnson Publishing Company|title=Ebony Jr.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0MQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=November 1984|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|page=31|issn=0022-2984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 2005, Peter Vallone Jr., a City Council member in New York and several other councilors protested against [[Sony]]'s decision to use graffiti commercially in their [[PlayStation Portable#Controversial advertising campaigns|PlayStation Portable]] advertising in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Miami as they believed it would have a negative influence on children and encourage them to deface property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/old/content/2006/01/5988.ars|title=Sony asked to clean up NYC graffiti ads|publisher=Ars Technica|date=January 16, 2006|accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial success==
[[File:Commercial graffiti, London.jpg|thumb|right|Commercial graffiti in [[Fashion Street]], [[London]]]]

In [[New York City]], legal graffiti and employment has become big business, appearing with owners' permission on everything from walls to railroad boxcars.&lt;ref name="Snyder2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Snyder|first=Gregory J.|title=Graffiti lives: beyond the tag in New York's urban underground|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rF4S3h0sVu0C&amp;pg=PA101|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=January 2009|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-4045-3|pages=101–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cooper and Sciorra, many young graffiti artists are keen to use their talents and aspire to achieve entrepreneurial success.&lt;ref name="Snyder2009"/&gt; Local businesses employing well-known graffiti artists are also said to enhance their credibility and business-customer relationship as well as reducing crime by employment.&lt;ref name="Snyder2009"/&gt; One prominent group in New York City is the "King of Murals" which run a commercial graffiti business and have been employed to promote global brands such as [[Coca-Cola]] and [[M&amp;M's]] in advertising campaigns and even hired by schools, hospitals and other healthcare groups to create artwork.&lt;ref name="Snyder2009"/&gt; Bronx-based [[TATS CRU]] has made a name for themselves doing legal advertising campaigns for companies like [[Coca-Cola]], [[McDonald's]], [[Toyota]], and [[MTV]]. [[Smirnoff]] and even [[Microsoft]] have hired artists to use [[reverse graffiti]] (the use of high pressure hoses to clean dirty surfaces to leave a clean image in the surrounding dirt) to increase awareness of their product.&lt;ref name="Forsyth2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=Patrick|title=Marketing: A Guide to the Fundamentals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BTBVY-Z9PvYC&amp;pg=PA207|accessdate=30 December 2010|year=2009|publisher=Bloomberg Press|isbn=978-1-57660-329-1|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[Klughaus Gallery]] started [[Graffiti USA]], a company offering interior graffiti murals for companies. Their work includes murals at the corporate offices of [[Linked In]], [[Facebook]], [[MasterCard]], and [[ABC News]], which featured a Graffiti USA commissioned mural on October 8, 2014 episode of [[Nightline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/watch-artists-created-nightline-graffiti-mural-26063838 | title=abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/watch-artists-created-nightline-graffiti-mural-26063838| work=ABC News | date=9 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Boston, Massachusetts]], a company named Alt Terrain specializes in hiring graffiti writers to paint legal murals as part of public performances which are hyped as "brand events" and may cost up to $12,500 for live performances.&lt;ref name="Snyder2009"/&gt; In [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]] for example, after the [[death of Michael Jackson]], Solomon "Disco" Stewart and a team of four artists named "The Berkshire Graffiti Network" for instance were paid to paint a "Michael Jackson Tribute" mural on the wall of a Pittsfield market on North Street.

[[File:Warszawa Stary Mokotów graffiti on shop window.jpg|thumb|250px|Legal advertising graffiti on grocer's shop window in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]]]
In the United Kingdom, [[Covent Garden]]'s [[Boxfresh]] used stencil images of a [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] revolutionary in the hopes of cross referencing would promote their store. Even the Israeli West Bank barrier has acted as a canvas for professional graffiti for hire teams. One Palestinian pacifist group will spray paint any message for 30 Euros, providing that it is not racist or violently motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://www.time.com/time/video/player/0,32068,23304222001_1898860,00.html|title=Graffiti for Hire in the West Bank|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|first=Tim|last=McGirk|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Art Crimes website is the first to be established in the field of commercial graffiti and hires some sixty artists to produce artwork.&lt;ref name="Snyder2009"/&gt;

===In video games===
[[File:Feliz 1984.JPG|thumb|right|An example of crossover between [[video game culture]] and graffiti culture found on the [[Berlin Wall]] ]]
Graffiti has become an important part of video game culture, often reflecting the oppression facing graffiti artists in public and battle for it to be seen by the establishment as a legitimate and indeed a legal art form. The ''[[Jet Set Radio]]'' series (2000–2003) tells the story of a group of teens fighting the oppression of a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] police force that attempts to limit the graffiti artists' [[freedom of speech]] &lt;ref name="West2009"/&gt; and others such as ''[[Graffiti Kingdom|Rakugaki Ōkoku]]'' series (2003–2005) for Sony's [[PlayStation 2]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Graffiti Kingdom: Playstation 2 Video Game Review|work =|publisher = Kidzworld|url = http://www.kidzworld.com/article/6032-graffiti-kingdom-playstation-2-video-game-review|accessdate = 30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; revolves around an anonymous hero and his magically imbued-with-life graffiti creations as they struggle against an evil king who only allows art to be produced which can benefit him. Similarly ''[[Marc Eckō's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure]]'' (2006), features a story line involving training in graffiti artistry and fighting against a corrupt city and its oppression of free speech, as in the ''Jet Set Radio'' series.&lt;ref name="Stang2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stang|first=Bendik|title=The book of games|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cllMaThkYlIC&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=1 November 2006|publisher=Book of Games|isbn=978-82-997378-0-7|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other non-graffiti-centric video games allow the player to produce graffiti, such as the [[Half-Life (series)|''Half-Life'' series]], the [[Tony Hawk's (series)|''Tony Hawk's'' series]], ''[[The Urbz: Sims in the City]]'', ''[[Rolling (video game)|Rolling]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]''.

===In apparel===
Graffiti has become a common stepping stone for many members of both the [[art and design]] community in North America and abroad. Within the United States, graffiti artists such as Mike Giant, Pursue, Rime, Noah and countless others have made careers in skateboard, apparel and shoe design for companies such as DC Shoes, Adidas, Rebel8 Osiris or Circa&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ganz, Nicolas. "Graffiti World". New York. Abrams. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, there are many others such as DZINE, Daze, Blade, The Mac etc. which have developed into gallery artists and at times do not even use their initial medium (spray paint) to produce artwork.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Keith Haring]], a well-known graffiti artist, contributed to bringing graffiti to the commercial mainstream.  In the 1980s, Haring opened his first Pop Shop: a store that offered everyone access to his works—which until then could only be found spray-painted on city walls. Pop Shop offered commodities like bags and T-shirts.  Haring explained that, "The Pop Shop makes my work accessible.  It's about participation on a big level, the point was that we didn't want to produce things that would cheapen the art.  In other words, this was still art as statement". [[Marc Ecko]], an urban clothing designer, has been an advocate of graffiti as an art form during this period, stating that "Graffiti is without question the most powerful art movement in recent history and has been a driving inspiration throughout my career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = SOHH.com|title = Marc Ecko Hosts "Getting Up" Block Party For NYC Graffiti, But Mayor Is A Hater|url = http://www.sohh.com/articles/article.php/7428 |date= August 17, 2005|accessdate =October 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But perhaps the greatest example of graffiti artists infiltrating mainstream pop culture is by the French crew, 123Klan. 123Klan founded as a graffiti crew in 1989 by Scien and Klor, have gradually turned their hands to illustration and design while still maintaining their graffiti practice and style.&lt;ref name="Computer arts"&gt;{{cite book|title=Computer arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y0pUAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Future}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so they have designed and produced, logos and illustrations, shoes, and fashion for numerous global firms.

===Tourism===
Most of the major cities across the world have graffiti and street art tours, often run by local graffiti artists who want to bring their talent to the public on a more socially accepted level.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=Incredible Street Art Tours|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/picturegalleries/9880046/Incredible-street-art-tours.html|accessdate=30 November 2015|publisher=Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally started with walking or biking tours around the cities, street art tours have expanded to include graffiti workshops, using graffiti art tools, stencils and spray cans.

Tours exist in New York, London, Berlin, Hamburg, Reykjavik, Barcelona, Montreal and Paris.&lt;ref name="Conde Nast Traveler"&gt;{{cite web|title=Conde Nast Traveler|url=http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2014-11-07/the-world-s-best-cities-for-street-art/|accessdate=30 November 2015|date=7 November 2014|publisher=Conde Nast Traveler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marketing ===
Commercial graffiti is used as a type of marketing known as [[guerrilla marketing]] where one company has limited funds for advertising its product may it be goods or services. Generally done by smaller companies at the beginning due to small budgets but adopted by big brands (e.g. Coca-Cola&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_4vOUDImE|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520161329/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_4vOUDImE|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-05-20|title=coca cola connects india and pakistan|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This type of marketing has a way of going viral as it is done in a public place with limited resources but with new technology such as smart phones which can upload pictures and videos instantly to social media, so if there is legal permission by the government for graffiti people would do it during peak hours in communities for maximum exposure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Strategic Innovative Marketing (IC-SIM 2014), Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 12 February 2015 175:268-274|last=Ludmila, František|first=Navrátilová, Milichovský|publisher=Elsevier Ltd|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=268–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;( Navrátilová, L.

[[Image:'Dying Slave' Michelangelo JBU001.jpg|thumb|''Dying Slave'']]
The '''''Dying Slave''''' is a sculpture by the [[Italian Renaissance]] artist [[Michelangelo]]. Created between 1513 and 1516, it was to serve with another figure, the ''[[Rebellious Slave]]'', at the [[tomb of Pope Julius II]].&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, Erwin. "The First Two Projects of Michelangelo's Tomb of Julius II". ''The Art Bulletin'', Volume 19, No. 4, December 1937. pp. 561–579.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[marble]] figure 2.15 metres (7' 4") in height, and is held at the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]], Paris.

In 1976 the art historian Richard Fly wrote that it "suggests that moment when life capitulates before the relentless force of dead matter".&lt;ref&gt;Fly, Richard. ''Shakespeare's Mediated World''. Amherst, MA: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1976. p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, in a recent scholarly volume entitled ''The Slave in European Art'', Charles Robertson discusses the ''Dying Slave'' in the context of real [[slavery]] in [[Italy]] during the time of the [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Robertson, "Allegory and Ambiguity in Michelangelo's Slave", in ''The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed. [[Elizabeth McGrath (art historian)|Elizabeth McGrath]] and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirteen reproductions of the ''Dying Slave'' adorn the top storey of the [[12th arrondissement of Paris|12th arrondissement]] police station in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://breves-histoire.fr/vestiges/esclave-mourant-hotel-police/|title= « L’esclave mourant » de l’Hôtel de Police du 12ème|access-date=August 4, 2018| website=Brèves d'histoire|publisher=WordPress|language=French |trans-title=The Dying Slave on the police station of the 12th arrondissement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Art Deco]] in style, the building was designed in 1991 by architects {{ill|Manuel Núñez Yanowsky|es}} and [[Miriam Teitelbaum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://parisisinvisible.blogspot.com/2012/01/challenge-7-curious-figures-on-avenue.html Challenge 7: Curious figures on the Avenue Daumesnil] Retrieved 4 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paris-walking-tours.com/promenadeplantee.html Promenade Plantee] Retrieved 4 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literally meaning 'blown off roof', ''fukinuki yatai'' relates to the depiction of both interior and exterior environments - including rooms, screens and [[Japanese architecture|architecture]] where the roof and walls are removed and the beams are preserved. The basic visual feature depicts the interior scene from an upper diagonal with the roof, ceiling and sometimes inner partitions removed.&lt;ref&gt;Okudaira, Hideo (1973). ''Narrative picture scrolls''. Arts of Japan 5. Weatherhill.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Watanabe |first1=Masako |title=Narrative Framing in the "Tale of Genji Scroll": Interior Space in the Compartmentalized Emaki |journal=Artibus Asiae |date=1998 |volume=58 |issue=1/2 |pages=115–145 |doi=10.2307/3249997 |jstor=3249997}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an artistic perspective, it also importantly describes the composition by which [[Character (arts)|character]] relations, or even feelings, are depicted in the layout.

This technique was used in early Japanese ([[Heian period|Heian Period]] [[平安時代]]) scrolls with very few exceptions until realism in [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]] ([[鎌倉]]) art has flourished.&lt;ref&gt;Beynon, David 2012, Superflat architecture : culture and dimensionality'', in Interspaces : Art + Architectural Exchanges from East to West'', [The University of Melbourne, School of Culture and Communication], [Melbourne, Vic.], pp. 1-9. 
&lt;/ref&gt; The rudimentary function of fukinuki yatai is to portrait multiple narrative stories on the same painting using different spaces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The earliest usage of Fukinuki yatai was found in the biography of [[Prince Shōtoku]] ([[Prince Shōtoku|聖徳太子]]絵伝). Other typical examples are found in [[The Tale of Genji]] (源氏物語絵巻), [[Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki]] (紫式部日記絵巻), and [[Kasuga Gongen Genki E]] (春日権現験記絵巻) .

'''''{{lang|de|Generalmusikdirektor}}''''' (GMD, general [[music director]]) is a German title for the artistic director of an [[orchestra]], an institution or a town.&lt;ref name="mer132"&gt;Gerald Mertens: ''Orchestermanagement.'' VS – Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, Wiesbaden 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-531-16584-4}}, S. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A music director (Latin: ''director musices'') was originally the title of the person responsible for music in a town in Germany and Austria. [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] was music director in [[Leipzig]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] and later [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]] were music directors in [[Hamburg]], [[Robert Schumann]] was music director in [[Düsseldorf]].&lt;ref&gt;''Musikdirektor'' in: Brockhaus Riemann Musiklexikon, p. 7134; BRM Bd. 3, S. 177) (c) [[Schott Music|Schott]]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Generalmusikdirektor'' is a title given by larger towns to a person typically responsible for a symphony orchestra and the opera. The first person with this title was [[Gaspare Spontini]] in Berlin  in 1819. Currently, [[Daniel Barenboim]] has been ''Generalmusikdirektor'' of the [[Staatsoper Unter den Linden]] in Berlin from 1992.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15894">The following is a '''list of unproduced George Miller projects''' in roughly chronological order. During a career that has spanned over 40 years, [[George Miller (director)|George Miller]] has worked on projects which never progressed beyond the [[pre-production]] stage under his direction. A few of the projects were made after he left production.

==1990s==

===''Contact''===
* In 1993, Miller was hired to direct ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'' based on the story by [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Ann Druyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Head|first=Tom|url=https://www.amazon.com/Conversations-Sagan-University-Mississippi-Paperback/dp/B00DWWC4HA|title=Conversations with Carl Sagan|date=5 January 2006|publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]]|location=[[Jackson, Mississippi]]|page=89|access-date=May 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Contact'' commenced pre-production. Miller cast [[Jodie Foster]] in the lead role, approached [[Ralph Fiennes]] to play Palmer Joss and also considered casting [[Linda Hunt]] as the [[President of the United States]]. In addition to having aliens put on a [[laser lighting display]] around Earth, another version of the Goldenberg scripts had an alien wormhole swallow up the planet, transporting Earth to the center of the galaxy. Miller also asked Goldenberg to rewrite ''Contact'' in an attempt to portray the [[Pope]] as a key supporting character. Warner Bros. was hoping to have the film ready for release by Christmas 1996, but under Miller's direction pre-production lasted longer than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Benjamin Svetkey | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,288672,00.html | title = Making Contact | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1997-07-18 | accessdate = 2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio  fired the director, blaming pushed-back start dates, budget concerns, and Miller's insistence that the script needed five more weeks of rewriting after working on the film for over a year. [[Robert Zemeckis]] was eventually brought on to direct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chitwood|first1=Adam|title=George Miller Talks His Version of CONTACT; Likens It to INTERSTELLAR|url=http://collider.com/contact-george-miller-reveals-his-version-of-movie-was-like-interstellar/|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=8 May 2015|date=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2000s==

===''Justice League: Mortal''===
* In 2007, Miller signed on to direct a [[Justice League]] film titled ''[[Justice League in other media#Film|Justice League: Mortal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garrett|first1=Diane|title=George Miller to lead ‘Justice League’|url=https://variety.com/2007/film/features/george-miller-to-lead-justice-league-2-1117972369/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|accessdate=8 May 2015|date=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month roughly 40 actors and actresses were auditioning for the ensemble superhero roles, among them were [[Joseph Cross (actor)|Joseph Cross]], [[Michael Angarano]], [[Max Thieriot]], [[Minka Kelly]], [[Adrianne Palicki]] and [[Scott Porter]]. Miller intended to cast younger actors as he wanted them to "grow" into their roles over the course of several films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Borys| last = Kit | title = The Vine: Young actors seek ''Justice'' | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/vine-young-actors-seek-justice-152538| date = 2007-10-15 | accessdate = 2008-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[D.

[[Aquaman]] had yet to be cast.

==2010s==

===''Happy Feet 3''===
* In a 2011 interview, Miller was asked if he had any plans for ''[[Happy Feet Two#Possible_sequel|Happy Feet Three]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://collider.com/george-miller-happy-feet-2-mad-max-interview/126581/ |title=Director George Miller Talks HAPPY FEET TWO, MAD MAX, and JUSTICE LEAGUE |accessdate=January 21, 2012 |work=collider.com |date=November 16, 2011 |author=Christina Radish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"If you put a gun to my head and said, 'You have to come up with a story for ''Happy Feet 3'',' I’d say shoot me. I would have no idea. I really would have no idea. The stories creep up on you. You just have to allow the stories to come, and then they get in like little ear worms in your head and they won’t go away. If that happens and we’ve got the energy, we’ll do a third one. If it doesn’t happen, it doesn’t happen. That’s the only way you can do it. It has to be authentic. I really wanted to make this film better than the first one. Otherwise, at my age, what’s the point? You really want to make it better. If something comes up that’s really exciting and I can convey that enthusiasm to other people, then there would be a third one."|George Miller}}

===''Mad Max: Fury Road'' (sequels and spinoffs)===
* In 2011, Miller and McCarthy found during the writing process for ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]'' that they had enough story material for two additional scripts. One of these, entitled ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road#Sequels|Mad Max: Furiosa]]'', had already been completed, and Miller hoped to film it after the release of ''Fury Road''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Brook|title=George Miller's new script|url=http://www.afr.com/p/george_miller_new_script_q1wYu1EFjLM0cyZa4s97fI|website=[[The Australian Financial Review]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|access-date=8 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407192950/http://www.afr.com/p/george_miller_new_script_q1wYu1EFjLM0cyZa4s97fI|archivedate=7 April 2014|date=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, during an interview with ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', Hardy revealed that he was attached to star in three more ''Mad Max'' films following ''Fury Road''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/film-tv/8074/tom-hardy-esquire-interview/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331190806/http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/film-tv/8074/tom-hardy-esquire-interview/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=31 March 2015|title=Tom Hardy Is Esquire's May Cover Star|first=Miranda|last=Collinge|work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|date=30 March 2015|access-date=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, Miller told ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'': "Should ''Fury Road'' be successful, I've got two other stories to tell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/05/mad-max-fury-road/|title=Mad Max: What it takes to make the most intense movie ever |first=Logan|last=Hill|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|publisher=([[Condé Nast]])|date=11 May 2015|access-date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in May, Miller revealed that plans for the sequel had changed and the fifth film in the franchise will instead be titled ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road#Sequel|Mad Max: The Wasteland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lussier|first1=Germain|title=George Miller Gives 'Mad Max: Fury Road' Sequel a Title|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/george-miller-mad-max-fury-road-sequel/|website=[[/Film]]|access-date=19 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519013857/http://www.slashfilm.com/george-miller-mad-max-fury-road-sequel/|archivedate=19 May 2015|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=George Miller Promises 'More Max,' Starting With 'Mad Max: The Wasteland'|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/mad-max-george-miller-announces-more-movies-mad-max-the-wasteland-1201499904/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|access-date=19 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519013352/http://variety.com/2015/film/news/mad-max-george-miller-announces-more-movies-mad-max-the-wasteland-1201499904/|archivedate=19 May 2015|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, Miller's team had two scripts for sequels which they ended up with during the writing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/mad-max-the-wasteland-director-george-miller-confirms-fury-road-will-have-two-sequels-a6679756.html|title= Mad Max: The Wasteland: Director George Miller confirms Fury Road will have two sequels|author= Jack Shepherd|work= [[The Independent]]|publisher= Independent Print Limited|date= 5 October 2015|access-date= 11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, he clarified that ''Mad Max: The Wasteland'' was a [[working title]] for the sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/news/a673073/mad-max-fury-road-sequel-wont-star-charlize-therons-imperator-furiosa/#~pr3amDojvbH6bH|title= Mad Max Fury Road sequel won't star Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa|author= Simon Reynolds|work= [[Digital Spy]]|publisher= [[Hearst Corporation]]|date= 12 October 2015|access-date= 11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller reaffirmed his intent to continue the franchise after reports to the contrary surfaced following an interview in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/george-miller-new-mad-max-movies/|title=George Miller Will Be Involved with Mad Max Sequels|date=14 January 2016|work=Collider}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017, it was reported that a lawsuit filed by Miller's production company against Warner Bros. over a disputed $7 million bonus was likely to delay the production of any sequels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://amp.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/george-miller-sues-warner-bros-over-mad-max-fury-road-earnings-20171109-gziinh.html|title=Director George Miller sues Warner Bros over Mad Max: Fury Road earnings|date=2017-11-11|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller also wants a Furiosa spin-off starring [[Charlize Theron]] as the one-armed female warrior.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/18/mad-max-fury-road-sequel-george-miller?subid=5542353&amp;CMP=ema_861a&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the sequels and spinoffs have been delayed indefinitely until after the lawsuit is settled.

===''Akira'' remake===
* In 2015, Miller was planning on directing the live-action remake of ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', but he left due to scheduling conflicts with ''Mad Max: Fury Road''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/post/130554371706/george-miller-turned-down-the-live-action-akira|title=George Miller Turned Down The Live Action Akira Remake (Exclusive)|publisher=Yahoo UK|last=Bulter|first=Tom|date=6 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Growing up Asian in Australia''''' is an anthology of personal accounts, essays, short stories and poetry edited by [[Alice Pung]]. The discourse of "Asians" in Australia is similar to that in America and usually includes people of East Asian "[[oriental]]" background such as [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]] or [[Koreans]]. However, in this anthology the term "Asian" extends to people from Indian and Pakistani backgrounds, which is more in line with the British use of the term "Asian".

Contributors include established authors such as [[Ken Chau]], [[Shaun Tan]], [[Simone Lazaroo]], [[Vanessa Woods]], television personalities such as [[Annette Shun Wah]], [[Kylie Kwong]], [[Dr Cindy Pan]] and emerging writers and poets of Asian descent. There are over 50 contributors.

''Growing up Asian in Australia'' is currently a set text for the VCE English context of Identity and belonging.

[[File:khatam-bandi.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Detail of an Iranian jewel box decorated by khatam.]]
'''Khātam''' ({{lang-fa|خاتم}}) is an ancient [[Persian people|Persian]] technique of inlaying. It is a  version of [[marquetry]] where art forms are made by decorating the surface of wooden articles with delicate pieces of [[wood]], [[bone]] and [[metal]] precisely-cut intricate geometric patterns. '''Khatam-kari''' ({{lang-fa|خاتم‌کاری}}) or '''khatam-bandi''' ({{lang-fa|خاتم‌بندی}}) refers to the art of crafting a khatam. Common materials used in the construction of inlaid articles are [[gold]], [[silver]], [[brass]], [[aluminum]] and [[twisted wire]].

==Design and construction==
Designing of inlaid articles is a highly elaborate process. There are sometimes more than 400 pieces per square inch in a work of average quality.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, C. S. (1967). Materials.

Inlaid articles in the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid era]] took on a special significance as artists created their precious artworks. Woods used include [[betel]], [[walnut]], [[cypress]] and [[pine]].

==Examples==
[[File:Boite khatam.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A simple Khatam [[marquetry]] box decorated with [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] of triangles and 6-point stars on its sides, and a floral design on its lid]]
The ornamentation of the doors of holy places predominantly consists of inlaid motifs. Samples of these can be observed in the cities of [[Mashhad]], [[Qom]], [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]] and [[Rey, Iran|Rey]]. In the Safavid era, the art of marquetry flourished in the southern cities of Iran, especially in [[Isfahan]], [[Shiraz]] and [[Kerman]]. The inlaid-ornamented rooms at the [[Saadabad Palace]] and  the [[Marble Palace (Tehran)|Marble Palace]] in [[Tehran]] are among masterpieces of this art.

==Current status==
Khatam is practiced in Isfahan, Shiraz and Tehran. The art of inlaid and sudorific woodwork is undertaken in the workshops of the [[Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran]], as well as in private workshops.

Master Mohammad Bagher Hakim-Elahi (محمد باقرحكيم الهي) was a master of this art, and learned the techniques from Master Sanee Khatam in Shiraz.  Later in life, in early 1950's, he moved to Tehran, where he lived until the end of his life in March 2012.  He continued making Khatam master pieces, ranging from small frames, and jewelry boxes, to large items such as coffee tables, bed frames, dinner tables, and large chandeliers, some of which are currently in Museums in Iran, but most are in private collection all around the world, including southern California.  He also taught the art to his younger brother Asadolah Hakim-Elahi (ﺍﺴﺪﷲ ﺤﻛﻴﻢﺍﻠﻬﻰ).  Asadolah died from lymphoma in the late 1970s when he was in his mid 40s.

The '''learned pig''' was a pig taught to respond to commands in such a way that it appeared to be able to answer questions by picking up cards in its mouth. By choosing cards it answered [[Arithmetics|arithmetical problems]] and spelled out words. The "learned pig" caused a sensation in London during the 1780s. It became a common object of satire, illustrated in caricatures and referred to in literature.

The original "learned pig" was followed by other trained pigs, which subsequently became a feature of fairs and other public attractions in Europe and America during the 19th century. In the words of G.E. Bentley, "They served as subjects for cartoons by Rowlandson and moral essays in children's books and savage doggerel by Blake, and they illustrated the manners of the English in works by Joseph Strutt and Robert Southey and Thomas Hood. These freaks of learning clearly exercised a fascination among the literary geniuses of the age as they did among the swinish multitude."&lt;ref name = "bent"&gt;G.E. Bentley, "The Freaks of Learning", ''Colby Quarterly'', Vol. 18, Iss. 2, 1982, Art. 3, pp.88-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The original pig==
The original Learned Pig was trained by a Scotsman Samuel Bisset, who ran a travelling novelty show. The idea of an "intellectual" animal was not new. A similar attraction known as "[[Bankes's Horse|Marocco]] the thinking horse" (c.1586–c.1606) had been exhibited over a century earlier; there were also contemporary examples of the "horse of knowledge", exhibited for example at [[Astley's Amphitheatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara M. Benedict, ''Curiosity: A Cultural History of Early Modern Inquiry'', University of Chicago Press, 2002, p.206.&lt;/ref&gt; But performing horses were nothing unusual. No performing pigs are known to have been trained before.

The pig was shown with great success in Dublin. After Bisset's death the pig was taken over by a Mr Nicholson, who toured it in Britain.&lt;ref name ="jan"&gt;Jan Bondeson, ''The feejee mermaid and other essays in natural and unnatural history'', Cornell University Press, 1999, pp.20-28&lt;/ref&gt; It was exhibited in Nottingham in 1784, coming to London in the following year."&lt;ref name = "bent"/&gt; According to publicity at the time,

&lt;blockquote&gt;This entertaining and sagacious animal casts accounts by means of Typographical cards, in the same manner as a Printer composes, and by the same method sets down any capital or Surname, reckons the number of People present, tells by evoking on a Gentleman's Watch in company what is the Hour and Minutes; he likewise tells any Lady's Thoughts in company, and distinguishes all sorts of colours.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The show was a great success, and the pig later toured the provincial towns, returning to London later in the year and then moving on to the continent of Europe. After a career of four years a report stated that the pig died in 1788. However, a later report claimed that it had just returned from France following the revolution of 1789, and was ready to "discourse on the Feudal System, the Rights of Kings and the Destruction of the Bastille".&lt;ref name ="jan"/&gt;

The phenomenon caused much comment. [[James Boswell]] recalls conversations with [[Samuel Johnson]] in which he joked about the pig's scholarship. Johnson never saw the pig. He died just before it came to London, but he commented on a report of its show in Nottingham. He suggested that  "the pigs are a race unjustly calumniated. ''Pig'' has, it seems, not been wanting to ''man'', but ''man'' to ''pig''. We do not allow ''time'' for his education, we kill him at a year old." Another man present joked that [[Alexander Pope]] would not have used the pig as a symbol of "the lowest degree of grovelling instinct" in his works if this creature had been known to him, but added that the pig had probably been subject to some form of torture to force it to respond to commands. Johnson replied that at least it had escaped slaughter: "the pig has no cause to complain; he would have been killed the first year if he had not been ''educated'', and protracted existence is a good recompence for very considerable degrees of torture."&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, ''Life of Johnson'', July 12, 1784.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion about how the pig had been trained also led to disputes about the cognitive abilities of pigs; whether the animal actually recognised letters or even words, or whether it was simply responding to direct prompting. The phenomenon was also discussed in instructional literature aimed at children, to describe the essential difference between human and animal capacities and to warn against cruelty to animals, on the assumption that the pigs were badly beaten by their trainers to force them to behave. Mrs Trimmer in her children's book ''The Robin Redbreasts'' (1788), "designed to teach children the proper treatment of animals", mentions the pig in chapter entitled "The Cruel Boy": aiming to teach that animals are not "mere machines, actuated by the unerring hand of Providence", it says that the sight of the Learned Pig, "which has lately been shown in London, has deranged these ideas, and I know not what think".

==Later pigs==
[[File:Toby the sapient pig.jpg|thumb|left|Poster for Toby the Sapient Pig]]
In 1798 a learned pig appeared in the United States. William Frederick Pinchbeck displayed a "Pig of Knowledge" in [[New England]]. He claimed to have toured all the major towns of the Union and introduced the pig to President [[John Adams]], to "universal applause".&lt;ref&gt;David Morgan, Sally M. Promey, ''The visual culture of American religions'', University of California Press, 2001, p.212.&lt;/ref&gt; Pinchbeck later explained his methods of training the pig in a pamphlet.&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Pinchbeck, ''The Expositor, or, Many Mysteries Unravelled. Delineated in a Series of Letters, between a Friend and his Correspondent. Comprising the Learned Pig, Invisible Lady and Acoustic Temple, Philosophical Swan, Penetrating Spy Glasses, Optical and Magnetic, and Various other Curiosities on similar Principles: Also, A few of the most wonderful Feats as performed by the Art of Legerdemain: With Some Reflections on Ventriloquism'', Boston, 1805.&lt;/ref&gt; He denied that any form of torture was involved, insisting that it was better to "coax" the pig to follow instructions. The animal would soon learn to respond to the slightest hints of movement from the trainer.&lt;ref name = "bent"/&gt; He stated that credulous spectators accused him of using witchcraft, one stating that "his performances were the effects of the Black Art; that the Pig ought to be burnt, and the Man banished, as he had no doubt but...[his trainer] familiarly corresponded with the devil." Others suggested that the pig was evidence of reincarnation: "the spirit of the grunting philosopher might once have animated a man."&lt;ref name = "bent"/&gt;

In the early 19th century, Nicholas Hoare, an illusionist, exhibited "Toby the sapient pig" in London. Toby could "discover a person’s thoughts", a skill "never heard of before to be exhibited by an animal of the swine race". Around 1817 Toby also published an autobiography, ''The life and adventures of Toby, the sapient pig: with his opinions on men and manners. Written by himself''.

A pig owned by Pinchbeck was shown in London between 1818 and 1823. According to his publicity, the pig had acquired his wisdom from "Souchanguyee, the Chinese Philosopher." He answered questions by "pointing to cards, letters, and persons in the audience."&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Altick, ''The Shows of London'' (1978), p. 37-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Toby" became a standard name for a learned pig. The writer Harrison Weir depicts a learned pig called Toby, which he saw a "year ago at Camberwell Fair" for a penny. According to Harrison, the pig carried a correctly numbered card to a person who had called out a number; it spelled "vittels," and then it left to have some, "with a joyful grunt, and the show was over."&lt;ref name = "bent"/&gt;

==Caricature==
[[File:Downfall of taste.JPG|thumb|''The Downfall of Taste and Genius'' (1784). The classical muses flee while the Learned Pig leads an assault on the arts, as Shakespeare's and Pope's works are cast aside.]]

The original learned pig inspired a large number of satirical comments and comic prints. [[Thomas Rowlandson]] published a caricature of "The Wonderful Pig"  in 1785, in which the pig is shown displaying his erudition to a crowd of amazed ladies and gentlemen. A placard states "The Surprising PIG well versed in all Languages, perfect Arethmatician Mathematician &amp; Composer of Musick."&lt;ref name ="mar"&gt;Mary George, ''Catalogue of the Political and Personal Satires preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum'', Vol. VI 1784— 1792, British Museum, 1938, pp. xxvi, 197; 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other caricatures used the appeal of the pig to poke fun at theatrical fads of the day. ''The Theatrical War'' satirises the actor-impresario [[John Palmer (actor)|John Palmer]], dressed in Shakespearean costume, being threatened by other attractions including the pig.

The 1784 print ''The Downfall of Taste and Genius, or, The World As it Goes'' by [[Samuel Collings]] ridicules "the taste that prefers the Dancing Dogs, the Learned Pig, and Harlequin to Shakespeare". This was a "recurrent theme" of prints at the time.&lt;ref name ="mar"/&gt; The print depicts the pig leading a procession of performing animals who knock over figures representing the fine arts while copies of Shakespeare's and Pope's works are trampled underfoot by the animals.&lt;ref name ="mar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Keen, "The 'Ballonomania': Science and Spectacle in 1780s England", ''Eighteenth-Century Studies'', 39/4, 2006, p.527.&lt;/ref&gt;

An anonymous print entitled "The Wonderful Pig of Knowledge" shows a pig performing in a parlour apparently engaged in spelling the word "PORC[INE]"

Politicians were also satirised by being compared to the pig. [[William Pitt the younger|William Pitt]] was referred to as "the Wonderful Pig" on several occasions. One satirical print showed Pitt with the body of a pig; the caption asserted that among his powers was the ability to explain recent Acts of Parliament, a feat "before never having been even ''attempted'' in these our realms!!!" In one print Pitt and his opponent [[Charles James Fox]] were both depicted as competing learned pigs.&lt;ref name ="jan"/&gt;

==Literature==
[[File:Toby learned pig.JPG|left|thumb|Toby learning Latin grammar, a caricature by [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]].]]
The concept of the "learned pig" became a common motif in satirical literature by the late 18th century, playing on the implied contrast between gross physicality and intellectual superiority. The poet [[William Cowper]] lamented that his fame had been unfavourably compared to both the pig and a "prostitute" (the notoriously promiscuous actress [[George Anne Bellamy|Anne Bellamy]]).&lt;ref name ="jan"/&gt; A poem published in 1785 referred to the fact that the pig had arrived in London just after Johnson's death,

:Though Johnson, learned Bear, is gone,
:Let us no longer mourn our loss,
:For lo, a learned Hog is come,
:And wisdom grunts at Charing Cross.

The anonymous pamphlet ''The Story of the Learned Pig, By an officer of the Royal Navy'' (1786) picked up the theme of reincarnation. This presents itself as the personal reminiscences of the pig, as told to the author. He describes himself as a soul that has successively migrated from the body of [[Romulus]] into various humans and animals before becoming the Learned Pig. He recalls his previous incarnations. After Romulus he became [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]], and then entered several human and animal bodies. Adapting the Shakespeare theme, the pamphlet states that he became a man called "Pimping Billy", who worked as a horse-holder at a playhouse with Shakespeare and was the real author of his plays. He then became a famous British aristocrat and general — identified only by asterisks — before entering the body of a pig.&lt;ref&gt;McMichael, George L.; Glenn, Edgar M. (1962), Shakespeare and His Rivals: A Casebook on the Authorship Controversy, Odyssey Press, p.56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Puns on the name "Bacon", referring to the philosopher [[Francis Bacon]], also appeared in the literature. In the poem "The Prophetic Pig", in ''The Whim of the Day'' (c.1794) a believer in reincarnation states, "I can easily trace...A metempsychosis in this pig's face!...And in transmigration, if I'm not mistaken,/This learned pig must be, by consanguinity,/Descended from the great Lord Bacon."&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted under the title "The Fortune Teller" in [[Thomas Tegg]], ''The Vocal Annual, or Singer's own book for 1831: a collection of the newest and most popular songs of the day'', London Tegg, 1831, p.275-7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hood]]'s poem ''The Lament of Toby, The Learned Pig'' also uses the Bacon pun, adding another on the poet [[James Hogg]]. He describes the thoughts of a learned pig forced to retire from his intellectual pursuits to be fattened for slaughter. The pig says "Goodbye to the poetic Hogg!/The philosophic Bacon!":

:In this world, pigs, as well as men,
:Must dance to fortune's fiddlings,
:But must I give the classics up,
:For barley-meal and middlings?

[[William Blake]] attacked debased public taste in a poem dedicated to the artist [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]], writing that the nation which neglected Barry might "give pensions to the Learned Pig / Or the Hare playing on a Tabor".&lt;ref name = "cat"&gt;V.A.C. Cattrell, ''City of laughter: sex and satire in eighteenth-century London'', Atlantic, 2006, p.42-3.&lt;/ref&gt; He also alludes to it in his satire ''[[An Island in the Moon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ackroyd, ''Blake'', London: Vintage, 1995, pp.92-5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1807 [[Robert Southey]] parodied the contrast between real genius and meretricious celebrity by referring to the pig, noting that "the learned pig was in his day a far greater object of admiration to the English nation than ever was Sir Isaac Newton."&lt;ref name = "cat"/&gt; [[William Wordsworth]] refers to the pig in ''[[The Prelude]]'', describing it as one of the "freaks of nature" to be seen at [[Bartholomew Fair]]:

:...Albinos, painted Indians, Dwarfs,
:The Horse of knowledge, and the learned Pig
:All out-o'-the-way, far-fetched, perverted things,
:All freaks of nature, all Promethean thoughts
:Of man, his dulness, madness, and their feats
:All jumbled up together, to compose
:A Parliament of Monsters.&lt;ref&gt;William Wordsworth, ''The Prelude'', Book VII, lines 715-721&lt;/ref&gt;

The pig continued to be a common reference point for writers, mentioned by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and [[Charles Dickens]] among others. In ''[[The Mudfog Papers]]'' Dickens describes a moving lecture given at the ''Mudfog Society for the Advancement of Everything'' by Mr Blunderum on the dying moments of the learned pig. The lecturer was asked whether the learned pig was related to the [[Pig-faced women#The Pig-faced Lady of Manchester Square|Pig-faced Lady]], causing embarrassment to an audience member who ''was'' related to the lady, but who refused to admit a family connection to the learned pig.

Even [[Mrs Beeton]] begins her recipe for cooking sucking pig with the observation that pigs are capable of "education" "and though, like the ass, naturally stubborn and obstinate, that he is equally amenable with other animals to caresses and kindness". This is proven by "the instance of the learned pig, first exhibited about a century since, but which has been continued down to our own time by repeated instances of an animal who will put together all the letters or figures that compose the day, month, hour and date of the exhibition, besides many other unquestioned evidences of memory."&lt;ref&gt;''Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management'' (Nicola Humble, editor), Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2000, p.196.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, the "Learned Pig" has made a reappearance of sorts in popular culture; in 2003 he was the subject of a song, "The Learned Pig," which was part of a concept concert and recording by the UK band the [[Tiger Lillies]], based on a poem by [[Edward Gorey]]. The musical "Toby the Incredible Learned Pig", written by Daniel Freedman, was a finalist in the Wonderland One Act Festival at Theater Works 42nd St. NYC in 2007. In 2011 there appeared a novel, ''Pyg: The Memoirs of a Learned Pig'', by [[Russell Potter]], based on the career of the original "Toby". ({{ISBN|0857862405}})

The '''Libro de' Disegni''' (Italian for ''Book of Drawings'') was a collection of drawings gathered, sorted and grouped by [[Giorgio Vasari]] whilst writing his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]''. By the time of his death in 1574 it is thought to have contained around 526 drawings, of which 162 are now in the [[Louvre]] and 83 in the [[Nationalmuseum, Stockholm]]&lt;ref&gt;Per Bjurstrom, ''Italian Drawings from the Collection of Giorgio Vasari'' (Stockholm: Nationalmuseum, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;. There are also drawings from the ''Libro'' in the prints and drawings departments of the [[Uffizi]], the [[British Museum]], the [[Albertina]], the [[National Gallery of Art]] and other institutions.

==Origins and dispersal==
Some art historians believe they were gathered to illustrate Vasari's ''Lives'' directly, as a visual index of the artists' works, whilst others believe it was a separate document in its own right. In his preface to the ''Lives'', Vasari described his reasons for writing:
{{blockquote|When I took on the task of writing about the life of the great artists ... I made a choice, which I have also explained, between what was good, what was better and what was perfect. I carefully pointed out the techniques, aspects, styles, particularities and fantasies of painters and sculptors. I also tried my best to reveal to those who did not succeed alone the causes and origins of different styles, and the ascending or descending curve followed by arts in different epoques and among different characters}}

No text reveals why Vasari compiled his collection of drawings, but it was probably to illustrate the styles of the different artists he wrote about and to show how he had divided them "into three parts, or rather let us call them periods, between the rebirth of the arts and our own time - each of these is distinguished from the others by manifest differences". The earliest drawing in the collection was by [[Cimabue]] and the latest dated to Vasari's own time. In the 1550 and 1568 editions of the ''Lives'' Vasari insisted on drawings as documents which allowed the viewer to perceive the ''maniera'' of the great masters of painting and mentioned when he owned one or two drawings by a particular artist, such as at the end of his life of [[Filippo Lippi]]:
("Fra Filippo drew very well, as one can see in my own ''Libro'' of the most famous painters, in the preparatory drawings for the altarpiece at Santo Spirito and the frescoes in the Prato chapel.") and in his life of [[Sandro Botticelli]] ("Sandro's drawings were of a totally unique excellence; and, after his death, more and more artists have been keen to have some of his drawings; and I myself, in my collection, have a few which were done with great care and judgement").

Giorgio Vasari was one of the founders of the [[Accademia delle Arti del Disegno]] set up in [[Florence]] by [[Cosimo I of Tuscany]] in 1563. He and the other founders wished to use this academy to promote artists above the status of artisans.&lt;ref&gt;K. Barzman, ''The Florentine Accademia del Disegno  : Liberal Education and the Renaissance Artist'', p. 14-32, in A. Boschloo ed., ''Academies of Art Between Renaissance and Romanticism'', Leid Kunsthistorisch Jaarboek, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liana de Girolami Cheney, ''The Homes of Giorgio Vasari'', {{p.|5-20}}, Peter Lang Publishing, New York, 2006 {{ISBN|0-8204-7494-0}} [https://books.google.fr/books?id=4crgY-AN2mUC&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false (''sample'')]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a passionate collector of drawings and in his ''Libro'' he set them in his own paper frames and gathered drawings by one or more painters on a single sheet. In [[1528]] he received a collection of [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]'s drawings, as one of Ghiberti's descendents.&lt;ref&gt;Liana de Girolami Cheney, ''Giorgio Vasari's Teachers : Sacred &amp; Profane Art'', p.250, note 10, Peter Lang Publishing, New York, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-8204-8813-4}} [https://books.google.fr/books?id=Edi7bg9V3aEC&amp;pg=PA250#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false (''read online'')]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Vasari's death, the sheets of the ''Libro'' were initially bought in 1574 by the Florentine collector [[Niccolò Gaddi (1537-1591)|Niccolò Gaddi]] (1537-1591).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/niccolo-gaddi_res-8e4caa38-87ed-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_%28Dizionario_Biografico%29/ {{it icon}} Vanna Arrighi, ''Niccolò Gaddi'', Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani]&lt;/ref&gt; They were then sold by Gaddi's heirs before 18 May 1638, the date of death of Lorenzo Sabbatini, who had been put in charge of the ''Libro''. They were then dispersed among the [[Medici]], [[Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel|Arundel]], Quesnel, [[Pierre Crozat|Crozat]] and Mariette collections during the 17th and 18th centuries.

The first drawings from the ''Libro de' Disegni'' to enter the French national collection were bought by [[Everhard Jabach]], probably when the Arundel collections were sold in 1646 and 1654 after his and his widow's deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Monbeig-Goguel, ''Collections de Louis XIV, dessins, albums, manuscrits'', {{p.|46}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then passed from Jabach into [[Louis XIV]]'s drawings collection in 1671. Further sheets from the ''Libro'' were added when the French royal collection bought part of the collection of [[Pierre-Jean Mariette|Mariette]] in 1755 and when [[Charles Paul Jean Baptiste de Bourgevin Vialart de Saint-Morys|Saint-Morys]]'s collection was seized by the revolutionary government in 1793. These later additions may have originated in the sale of the Crozat collection, for which a catalogue survives. Part of the Mariette collection was sold to the royal collection in 1775. Other pages entered the French national collection from [[émigré]] goods seized by the revolutionary government and via gift and purchase.

Nothing else is known about him or his life, though Umberto Gnoli suggests he can be identified with Giovanni Paolo di Cola dal Borgo and that theory was supported by Ricci due to the journal of [[Alberto Alberti|Berto Alberti]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/alberto-alberti_res-eb412d61-87e5-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/ Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani Treccani : Alberti, Alberto]&lt;/ref&gt;, which refers to the death of a painter named Giovanni Paolo del Colle on 19 September 1556. He was mentioned in the marriage register entry for his sister Lodovica di Francesco di Michelangelo dal Colle, dating to 29 November 1538 and showing he was born around 1518. A 1550 document published by Josephine von Henneberg links him to the decoration of the Parisiani chapel in [[San Marcello al Corso]] in Rome. He can also be seen assisting Vasari in painting the [[Vasari Sacristy|refectory of the Monteoliveto monastery in Naples]], as cited in a 1545 letter from Vasari to Don Miniato Pitti&lt;ref&gt;Christopher L. C. Ewart Witcombe, ''A Vasari assistant : Giovanni Paolo del Colle'', Source: Notes in the History of Art, volume 6, no. 4, Summer 1987&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Image:J.League officially licensed products.jpg|thumb|right]]

This is a list of soccer video games based on/licensed by the [[J. League]].

The first licensed game, ''[[J-League Fighting Soccer]]'', was released for the Game Boy on December 27, 1992. Two months later ''[[European Club Soccer|J-League Champion Soccer]]'' was released for the Mega Drive. ''[[J-League Greatest Eleven]]'' was released for the PC Engine a day before the start of the [[1993 J. League|inaugural season]].

Since then, other titles were released for many other platforms. Popular franchises include: ''Pro Striker'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/pro-striker-series ''Pro Striker'' series] at [[MobyGames]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[J.League Excite Stage (series)|Excite Stage]]'', ''[[J. League Soccer Prime Goal (series)|Prime Goal]]'', ''[[Sega Worldwide Soccer|Victory Goal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/sega-worldwide-soccer-victory-goal-series ''Victory Goal'' series] at MobyGames&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamefaqs.com/search/index.html?game=J.League+Victory+Goal ''J-League Victory Goal'' (Sega Saturn titles)] at [[GameFAQs]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[International Superstar Soccer|Perfect Striker]]'', ''[[:ja:プロサッカークラブをつくろう!|Pro Soccer Club o Tsukurou!]]'' and ''[[Winning Eleven]]''.

In 2002, Konami released ''Captain Tsubasa: Eikou no Kiseki'' for the Game Boy Advance, the only game from the ''[[Captain Tsubasa]]'' series which is licensed by J. League.

These games are based exclusively on the J. League, however the titles released more recently also contain other leagues.

The recent [[Pro Evolution Soccer|Winning Eleven]] titles (2012, 2013) are fully licensed by the J. League.

With [[EA Sports]] acquiring the license for the league for ''[[FIFA 17]]'', the J.League will make its first real appearance in a football game by Western developers.

'''Computer and video game collector and limited editions''' (commonly referred to as CE and LE's) are [[video games]] packaged with [[Special edition|bonus materials and enhancements]] not available in the standard release.  Such bonuses can range from special packaging to printed artwork to extra discs containing additional content.  These versions are typically of a predetermined limited release and act as promotional tools for the publisher, and items of value for collectors.&lt;ref&gt;"For the Fans: ''GI'' Looks into Limited Editions," ''Game Informer'' 179 (March 2008): 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--'''Before making additions please note the following paragraph'''--&gt;Not all titles released as a "Special/Collector's/Etc. Edition" are necessarily in any substantial way superior to the standard edition. True Collector's and Limited Editions are those released with extra materials or content, that were limited in every case.  &lt;!--It also only refers to titles released for the North American market, to help control the size of the list. The Japanese market, for example, has many dozens of titles receive an LE release every year. (Source?)--&gt; For example, most [[Game of the Year]], Gold, or Platinum editions are [[Reissue|re-releases]] and rarely contain anything of extra value nor are of particular limited release, and thus are not generally considered Collector's or Limited Editions. &lt;!--Feel free to use the discussion page if you are unsure about a potential addition.--&gt;

| ''' ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' Limited Edition
| DC
| The Limited Edition of Sonic Adventure was a pre-release version of the game distributed to stores and rental locations, it did not include any bonus content. The Limited Edition of Sonic Adventure was originally distributed to approximately 400 Funcoland locations as a disc-only release to be used in Dreamcast kiosks promoting the upcoming release of the console. These discs included a trimmed down version of the game based on the Japanese release and had saving and network connectivity disabled along with other minor differences; they were known to be buggy.

Later, a variant of the release was distributed to Hollywood Video as part of a pre-release promotion in which the game could be rented along with a console before it's official launch. This variant of the game allowed saving and included a case and manual. The disc, game manual cover, and spine of the case all state “Limited Edition” and the artwork differs slightly from the standard edition release. Due to its exclusive distribution through a rental chain many of the original game cases were lost or destroyed and replaced in whole or in part with cases or manuals from the standard edition release, also many discs were tagged with a “Hollywood Video” security sticker.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1970">"'''Little Expressionless Animals'''" is a 1988 short story by [[David Foster Wallace]]. It was first published in ''[[The Paris Review]]'', and reprinted in his short story collection ''[[Girl with Curious Hair]]''. The ''[[Village Voice]]'' described it as "riveting".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2000-08-22/news/trivial-necessities/ ''Trivial Necessities: How to Win Friends and Influence People''], Hillary Chute, [[Village Voice]], August 22 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The main narrative of the story is told in a cut-up style, with events taking place in a nonlinear fashion to increase dramatic tension.

==Plot==
Julie Smith is a contestant on ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', an American television game show, in the 1980s. After her fourth win, the show's producers decide that she is popular enough that they will not limit her to five appearances (as was the practice at the time). As a result, Julie wins every ''Jeopardy!'' game for three years, and uses her winnings to pay for the care of her [[autistic]] brother. 

As Julie consistently wins every ''Jeopardy!'' match, studio executive [[Merv Griffin]] decides to increase the tension within the show by secretly convincing Julie's brother to compete against her, and rigs the game in his favor by selecting only questions that relate to animals — the only category with which Julie struggles.

'''Maria Adelaide Amaral''' (born 1 July 1942, in [[Alfena]]) is a [[Portuguese Brazilian]] playwright, screenwriter, and novelist. A good deal of her plays concern disaffected urban professionals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=97NoYRx96ZAC&amp;pg=PA307&amp;dq=%22Maria+Adelaide+Amaral%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=F89ITqmpLITEsQKqtr2SCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Maria%20Adelaide%20Amaral%22&amp;f=false The Cambridge history of Latin American literature: Brazilian ..., Volume 2 by Roberto González Echevarrı́a, pg 307]&lt;/ref&gt; She has been classed as among the two major women playwrights of Brazil, the other being [[Leilah Assunção]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w0Lc79wP-40C&amp;pg=PA32 Tentative transgressions: homosexuality, AIDS, and the theater in Brazil by Severino João Medeiros Albuquerque, pg 32]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''oil lamp''' is an object used to produce light continuously for a period of time using an oil-based fuel source. The use of oil lamps began thousands of years ago and continues to this day, although not commonly anymore. 

Oil lamps are a form of [[lighting]], and were used as an alternative to candles before the use of electric lights. Starting in 1780, the [[Argand lamp]] quickly replaced other oil lamps still in their basic ancient form. These in turn were replaced by the [[kerosene lamp]] in about 1850. In small towns and rural areas the latter continued in use well into the 20th century, until such areas were finally [[Electrification|electrified]] and light bulbs could be used.

Sources of fuel for oil lamps include a wide variety of plants such as nuts (walnuts, almonds) and seeds (sesame, olive, castor, flax). Also widely used were animal fats (butter, fish oil, shark liver, whale blubber, seals). 

Most modern lamps (such as [[Lantern#Modern fueled lanterns|fueled lanterns]]) have been replaced by [[Propane|gas-based]] or [[Naphtha#Other applications|petroleum-based]] fuels to operate when emergency non-electric light is required. Therefore, oil lamps of today are primarily used for the particular ambience they produce.

==Components==
[[Image:Oil lamp Fandaqomiyah.jpg|thumb|Double-nozzled [[terracotta]] oil lamp found in [[Samaria]]]]

The following are the main external parts of a [[terra-cotta]] lamp:
* '''Shoulder'''
* '''Pouring hole'''

: The hole through which fuel is put inside the fuel chamber. The width ranges from 0.5-5 cm in general. There may be single or multiple holes.

* '''Wick hole''', and the '''nozzle'''.
: It may be just an opening in the body of the lamp, or an elongated nozzle. In some specific types of lamps, there is a groove on the superior aspect of the nozzle that runs along to the pouring hole to re-collect the oozing oil from the wick.
* '''Handle'''
: Lamps can come with or without a handle. The handle can come in different shapes. The most common is a ring shaped for the forefinger surmounted by a [[palmette]], on which the thumb is pressed to stabilize the lamp. Other handles can be crescent shaped, triangular, or semi-ovalular. The handleless lamps usually have an elongated nozzle, and sometimes have a [[Lug (knob)|lug]] rising diagonally from the periphery. The lug may act as a small handle where the thumb rests. Some lugs are pierced. It was speculated that pierced lugs were used to place a pen or straw, called the ''acus'' or ''festuca'', with which the wick was trimmed. Others think that the pierced lugs were used to hang the lamp with a metal hook when not in use.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* '''Discus'''
* '''Fuel chamber'''
: The fuel reservoir. The mean volume in a typical terra-cotta lamp is 20 cc.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Lamp typology==
Lamps can be categorized based on different criteria, including material ([[clay]], [[silver]], [[bronze]], [[gold]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]]), shape, structure, design, and imagery (e.g. symbolic, religious, mythological, erotic, battles, hunting).

==Lamp typological categories==
Typologically, lamps of the Ancient [[Mediterranean]] can be divided into seven major categories:

'''Wheel-made''': This category includes Greek and Egyptian lamps that date before the 3rd century BC. They are characterized by simple, little or no decoration, and a wide pour hole, a lack of handles, and a pierced or unpierced [[Lug (knob)|lug]]. Pierced lugs occurred briefly between 4th and 3rd century BC. Unpierced lugs continued until the 1st century BC.

'''Volute, Early Imperial''': With spiral, scroll-like ornaments ([[volute]]s) extending from their nozzles, these lamps were predominantly produced in Italy during the [[History of the Roman Empire#27 BC—AD 14: Augustus|Early Roman]] period. They have a wide discus, a narrow shoulder and no handle, elaborate imagery and artistic finishing, and a wide range of patterns of decoration.

'''High Imperial''': These are late Roman. The shoulder is wider and the discus is smaller with fewer decorations. These lamps have handles and short plain nozzles, and less artistic finishing.

'''Frog''': This is a regional style lamp exclusively produced in [[Egypt]] and found in the regions around it, between c. 100 and 300 AD. The [[frog]] ([[Heqet]]) is an Egyptian fertility symbol.

'''[[African Red Slip]]''' lamps were made in North Africa, but widely exported, and decorated in a red slip. They date from the 2nd to the 7th century AD and comprise a wide variety of shapes including a flat, heavily decorated shoulder with a small and relatively shallow discus. Their decoration is either non-religious, [[Christian]] or [[Jewish]]. Grooves run from the nozzle back to the pouring hole, it is hypothesized{{by whom|date=September 2015}} that this is to take back spilled oil. These lamps often have more than one pour-hole.

'''Slipper''' lamps are oval-shaped and found mainly in the [[Levant]]. They were produced between the 3rd to 9th centuries AD.
Decorations include vine scrolls, palm wreaths, and Greek letters.

'''Factory lamps''': Also called  ''Firmalampen'' (from [[German language|German]]), these are universal in distribution and simple in appearance. They have a channeled nozzle, plain discus, and 2 or 3 bumps on the shoulder.  Initially made in [[factories]] in Northern Italy and Southern [[Gaul]] between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, they were exported to all Roman provinces. The vast majority were stamped on the bottom to identify the manufacturer.

==Oil lamps in religious contexts==

===Judaism===
[[Image:Three Oil Jews lamps from Sardegna MUSEO NAZIONA SANNA SASSARI.jpg|thumb|Jewish [[terracotta]] oil lamps from [[Sardinia]] in the Museo Nazionale Sanna, Sassari]]

Lamps appear in the Torah and other Jewish sources as a symbol of “lighting” the way for the righteous, the wise, and for love and other positive values. While fire was often described as being destructive, light was given a positive spiritual meaning. The oil lamp and its light were important household items, and this may explain their symbolism. Oil lamps were used for many spiritual rituals.
The oil lamp and its light also became important ritualistic articles with the further development of Jewish culture and its religion.

*“And you shall command the people of Israel that they bring to you pure beaten olive-oil for the light, that a lamp may be set to burn continually”. Exodus 27:20
*“When you set the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the [[Menorah (Temple)|lamp stand]] (menorah).” Numbers 8: 1 -4
*"Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path." (Psalm 119:105) 
*“There I shall cause pride to sprout for David; I have prepared a lamp for my anointed.” (Psalms 132:16)
*“Your parents give you commands and teachings that are like lights to show you the right way. This teaching corrects you and trains you to follow the path to life.” (Proverbs 6:23);
*“The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord, searching all his innermost parts.” (Proverbs 20:27).
*“A lamp is called a lamp, and the soul of man is called a lamp.” (Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 30B)

====Chanukah====

The Temple [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]], a ritual seven-branched oil lamp used in the Second Temple, forms the centre of the [[Chanukah]] story and centers on the story of the [[Hanukkah#Traditional view|miracle of the oil]]: During the cleansing of the Second Temple in [[Jerusalem]] after its looting, the lamp was supposed to burn continuously, forever, but there was only oil enough for one day, and no more oil would be available for eight days. Miraculously, however, the oil expected to last for only one day burnt for eight full days instead.

===Christianity===&lt;!-- [[Lampada]] redirects here --&gt;
[[File:Saint Mercurius, bishop of Smolensk.jpg|thumb|Oil lamp burning before the [[icon]] of St. Mercurius of Smolensk, [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]], [[Ukraine]]]]

There are several references to oil lamps in the [[New Testament]]:

This story was told by [[Jesus]]: “At that time God’s kingdom will be like ten bridesmaids who went to wait for the bridegroom. They took their lamps with them. Five of the bridesmaids were foolish, and five were wise. The foolish bridesmaids took their lamps with them, but they did not take extra oil for the lamps. The wise bridesmaids took their lamps and more oil in jars. When the bridegroom was very late, the bridesmaids could not keep their eyes open, and they all fell asleep. At midnight someone announced, ‘The bridegroom is coming! Come and meet him!’ Then all the bridesmaids woke up. They made their lamps ready. But the foolish bridesmaids said to the wise girls, ‘Give us some of your oil. The oil in our lamps is all gone.’ The wise bridesmaids answered, ‘No! The oil we have might not be enough for all of us. But go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’ So the foolish bridesmaids went to buy oil. While they were gone, the bridegroom came. The bridesmaids who were ready went in with the bridegroom to the wedding feast. Then the door was closed and locked. Later, the other bridesmaids came. They said, ‘Sir, sir! Open the door to let us in.’ But the bridegroom answered, ‘Certainly not! I don’t even know you.’ So always be ready. You don’t know the day or the time when the Son of Man will come."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|25:1-13|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*“Your eye is the lamp of your body; when your eye is sound, your whole body is sound, your whole body is full of light; but when it is not sound, your body is full of darkness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|11:34|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|6:22|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*“He [i.e. [[John the Baptist]]] was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.”&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|5:35|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*“And night shall be no more; they need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they shall reign for ever and ever.”&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Rev|22:5|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|6:22-23|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is in YLT: "The lamp of the body is the eye, if, therefore, thine eye may be perfect, all thy body shall be enlightened, but if thine eye may be evil, all thy body shall be dark; if, therefore, the light that [is] in thee is darkness -- the darkness, how great!"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|6:22-23|YLT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Orthodox Church]] and many [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] oil lamps ({{lang-el|kandili}}, [[Church Slavonic|Slavonic]]: ''lampada'') are still used both on the [[Holy Table]] (altar) and to illuminate [[icon]]s on the [[iconostasis]] and around the [[temple]] (church building). Orthodox Christians will also use oil lamps in their homes to illuminate their [[icon corner]].

Traditionally, the [[sanctuary lamp]] in an Orthodox church is an oil lamp. It is lit by the [[bishop]] when the church is [[consecrated]], and ideally it should burn perpetually thereafter. The oil burned in all of these lamps is traditionally [[olive oil]].

In Greece and Cyprus, ''lampáda'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: λαμπάδα) is the special name for the [[candle]] held by the faithful on the [[Easter]] [[Easter Vigil#Byzantine Christianity: Eastern Orthodoxy .26 Greek Catholicism|service celebrating the Resurrection]]. Although any regular paraffin or beeswax candle can be used, a ''lampáda'' is usually a large, white candle or, in the case of children, a multicolored candle decorated with ribbons, beads, toys, dried flowers etc.  The ''lampáda'' is lit at midnight, with the [[Holy Fire|holy light]] from the priest's candle, and then carried home.  The sign of the cross is often made with soot from this flame on the [[lintel]] above the home's main door, and the flame is transferred to the [[icon corner]] oil lamp; only then can the ''lampáda'' be extinguished.  The cross over the door and the flame before the icons are believed to confer the Risen Lord's protection on the household.

In [[Eastern Christianity]] it is common to hang decorated ostrich eggs on the chains holding the oil lamps.&lt;ref name="CathDict"/&gt; The initial reason was probably to prevent mice and rats from climbing down the chain to eat the oil.&lt;ref name="CathDict"/&gt; Another, symbolical explanation is based in the [[Ostrich#Mating|fictitious]] tradition that female ostriches do not sit on their eggs, but stare at them incessantly until they hatch out, because if they stop staring even for a second the egg will addle.&lt;ref name="CathDict"/&gt; This is equated to the obligation of the Christian to direct his entire attention towards God during prayer, lest the prayer be fruitless.&lt;ref name="CathDict"&gt;{{cite book |article= Ostrich Eggs |title= A Catholic Dictionary |edition = 3 |editor= Rev.

===Islam===
"God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His light is, as it were, that of a niche containing a lamp; the lamp is [enclosed] in glass, the glass [shining] like a radiant star: [a lamp] lit from a blessed tree - an olive-tree that is neither of the east nor of the west  the oil whereof [is so bright that it] would well-nigh give light [of itself] even though fire had not touched it: light upon light! God guides unto His light him that wills [to be guided]; and [to this end] God propounds parables unto men, since God [alone] has full knowledge of all things". 24:35

[[File:Paavai-vilakku8.JPG|thumb|upright=.5|left|''Paavai vilakku'': anthropomorphic brass oil lamp from Tamil Nadu]]
Oil lamps are commonly used in [[Hindu temple]]s as well as in home shrines. Generally the lamps used in temples are circular with places for five wicks. They are made of metal and either suspended on a chain or screwed onto a pedestal. There will usually be at least one lamp in each shrine, and the main shrine may contain several. Usually only one wick is lit, with all five burning only on festive occasions. The oil lamp is used in the Hindu ritual of [[Aarti]].

In the home shrine, the style of lamp is usually different, containing only one wick. There is usually a piece of metal that forms the back of the lamp, which has a picture of a Hindu deity embossed on it. In many houses, the lamp burns all day, but in other homes, it is lit at sundown. The lamp in the home shrine is supposed to be lit before any other lights are turned on at night.

A hand-held oil lamp or incense sticks (lit from the lamp) are also used during the Hindu [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] ceremony. In the North of India, a five-wick lamp is used, usually fueled with [[ghee]]. On special occasions, various other lamps may be used for puja, the most elaborate having several tiers of wicks.

In [[South India]], there are a few types of oil lamps that are common in temples and traditional rituals, some of the smaller ones are used for offerings as well:a 
[[File:Deepalakshmi56.JPG|thumb|upright=.5|A Deepalakshmi oil lamp from [[Kumbakonam]]]]
*'''Deepalakshmi''', a brass lamp with a depiction of goddess [[Sri Lakshmi]] over the back piece. They are usually small and have only one wick.
*'''[[Nilavilakku]]''', a tall brass or bronze lamp on a stand where the wicks are placed at a certain height.
*'''Paavai vilakku''', a brass or bronze lamp in the form of a lady holding a vessel with her hands. This type of lamp comes in different sizes, from very small to almost life-size. There are also large stone versions of this lamp in [[Hindu temple]]s and shrines of [[Karnataka]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]], especially at the base of columns and flanking the entrance of temples. They have only one wick.
*'''Thooku vilakku''', a brass or bronze lamp hanging from a chain, often with multiple wicks.

===Chinese folk religion===
[[Image:Malaysian god shrine.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Traditional Chinese shrine in [[Petaling Jaya]], [[Malaysia]], containing an oil lamp]]
Oil lamps are lit at traditional Chinese shrines before either an image of a deity or a plaque with Classical Chinese characters giving the name of the deity. Such lamps are usually made from clear glass (they look similar to normal drinking glasses) and are filled with oil, sometimes with water underneath. A cork or plastic floater containing a wick is placed on top of the oil with the bottom of the wick submerged in the oil.

Such lamps are kept burning in shrines, whether private or public, and incense sticks or joss sticks are lit from the lamp.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2012}}
It is very difficult to say when and where the first oil lamp was used. This is partly because it is difficult to draw a line detailing when the primitive forms of creating a continuous source of light from fire can be termed a lamp.
The first lamps were made of naturally occurring objects, coconuts, sea shells, egg shells and hollow stones. Some believe that the first proper lamps were carved from stones. Curved stone lamps were found in places dated to the [[10th millennium BC]] (Mesolithic, Middle Stone Age Period, c. 10,300–8000 BC). The oldest stone-oil lamp was found in [[Lascaux]] in 1940 in a cave that was inhabited 10,000 to 15,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epalladioartworkshop.com/OILLAMPS/HISTORY/index.htm Epalladio Art Workshop]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:千灯馆新石器时代石灯.jpg|thumb|Neolithic stone lamps in Thousand Lamp Museum in Qiandeng town of [[Kunshan]]]]
Some archaeologists claim that the first shell-lamps were in existence more than 6,000 years ago (Neolithic, Later Stone Age, c. 8500–4500 BC). They believe that the alabaster shell-shaped lamps dug up in Sumerian sites dating 2600 BC were imitations of real shell-lamps that were used for a long time (Early Bronze, Canaanite / Bronze I-IV, c. 3300–2000 BC).

It is generally agreed that the evolution of handmade lamps moved from bowl-shaped to saucer-shaped, then from saucer with a nozzle, to a closed bowl with a spout.

=== Chalcolithic Age, c. 4500–3300 BC ===
The first manufactured red pottery oil lamps appeared. These were of the round bowl type.

=== The Bronze Ages (3200–1200 BC)===
Lamps were simple wheel-made bowls with a slight pinch on four sides for the wick. Later lamps had only one pinch. These lamps vary in the shape of the rim, the general shape of the bowl and the  shape of the base.

*Intermediate Bronze Age lamps (EBIV/MBI)
The earliest lamps known from Intermediate Bronze Age lamps (EBIV/MBI)
With the four wick lamps. These lamps are made from large bowls with four shallow pinches for wicks.
*Middle Bronze Age lamps (MB)
The four-wick oil lamps persist into this period, most of the lamps now have one wick. Early in this period the pinch is shallow, while later on it becomes more prominent and the mouth protrudes from the lamp's body. The bases are simple and flat. The crude potter’s wheel is introduced, transforming the handmade bowls to a more uniform container. The saucer style evolves into a single spout shape.
*Late Bronze Age lamps (LB)
A more pronounced, deeper single spout is developed, and it is almost closed on the sides. The shape is evolving to be more triangular, deeper and larger. All lamps are now wheel-made. The base is simple, usually flat.

===The Iron Age (1200–560 BC)===

The rim becomes wider and flatter with a deeper and higher spout. The tip of the spout is more upright in contrast to the rest of the rim.

The lamps are becoming variable in shape and distribution. We still find lamps similar to the Late Bronze period. In addition, other forms evolve, such as small lamps with a flat base and larger lamps with a round base. The later form continues into the Iron Age II.

In the later Iron Age, we encounter variant forms. One common type is small, with a wide rim and a wide base. Another type is a small, shallow bowl with a thick and high discus base.

===Arctic===
[[File:Descriptive booklet on the Alaska historical museum (1922) (14758775556).jpg|thumb|Seal oil lamps]]
{{see also|Seal-oil lamp}}
The [[seal-oil lamp]] ''(Qulliq)'' provided warmth and light in the harsh Arctic environment where there was no wood and where the sparse inhabitants relied almost entirely on seal oil. This lamp was the most important article of furniture for the [[Inuit]], [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]] and other [[Eskimo]] peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, T. A. &amp; Dalton, O. M. (1910) ''Handbook to the ethnographical collections.'' British Museum. Dept. of British and Mediaeval Antiquities and Ethnography Joyce,&lt;/ref&gt;

The lamps were made of stone and their sizes and shapes of lamps could be different, but mostly were elliptical or half-moon shaped. The wicks were mostly made of dried moss or [[Eriophorum callitrix|cottongrass]] and was lit along the edge of the lamp. A slab of seal blubber could be left to melt over the lamp feeding it with more fat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ralphmag.org/GD/eskimo-reading.html Eskimos and the Long Winter Darkness]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persian===
These large lamps have thin sides and a deep pinch, which flattens the mouth and makes it protrude outward.

===Greek===
Lamps are more closed to avoid spilling. They are smaller and more refined. Most are handleless. Some are with a lug, pierced and not pierced. The nozzle is elongated. The rim is folded over to make the nozzle, so it overlaps and is then pinched to make the wick hole.

They are round in shape, wheel-made.

===Chinese===
The earliest Chinese oil lamps are dated from the [[Warring States period]] (481-221 BC). The ancient Chinese created oil lamps with a refillable reservoir and a fibrous wick, giving the lamp a controlled flame.  Lamps were constructed from jade, bronze, ceramic, wood, stone, and other materials. The largest oil lamp excavated so far is one discovered in a 4th-century tomb located in modern Pingshan, Hebei.&lt;ref name="Metropolitan"&gt;{{cite book|title=China: Dawn of a Golden Age, 200-750 AD|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JbdS-R3y72MC&amp;pg=PA182|year=2004|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-1-58839-126-1|pages=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Austere Luminosity of Chinese Classical Furniture |last=Handler |first=Sarah |publisher= University of California Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0520214842 |publication-date=October 1, 2001 |page=308-309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Roman===
[[Image:Oil Lamp J 1.jpg|thumb|A terracotta oil lamp of the Roman Imperial era (replica)]]

Production of oil-lamps shifted to Italy as the main source of supply. Molds used. All lamps are closed in type. Lamps produced in large scale in factories. The lamp is produced in two parts, the upper part with the spout and the lower part with the fuel chamber. Most are of the characteristic  Imperial Type. It was round with nozzles of different forms (volute, semi-volute, U shaped), with a closed body and with a central disk decorated with reliefs and its filling hole.

===Late Roman===
The High Imperial Type. More decorations. Produced locally or imported in large scale. The multiple-nozzled lamps appear. Different varieties.

In this period we find the frog type lamps. These are kidney or heart shaped or oval. With the motif of a frog or its abstraction, and sometimes with geometrical motifs. They were produced around 100 AD. They are so variant that it is seldom that two identical ones are found.

===Byzantine===
Slipper shaped. Very decorative. The multiple nozzles continue. Most with handles. Some are complex in external anatomy.

===Early Islamic===
[[Image:Beja51.jpg|thumb|Early Islamic oil lamps (11th century), found in Southern Portugal]]

There is a transition period from Byzantine to Islamic lamps. The decoration on lamps of this transition period changed from crosses, animals, human likenesses, birds, fish, etc., to plain linear, geometric, and raised-dot patterns.

The early Islamic lamps continued the traditions of Byzantine lamps. Decorations were initially a stylized form of bird, grain, tree, plant, or flower. Then they became entirely geometric or linear with raised dots.

In 9th-century [[Baghdad]], [[al-Razi]] (Rhazes) described the first [[kerosene lamp]]; he referred to it as the "naffatah" in his ''Kitab al-Asrar'' (''Book of Secrets'').&lt;ref&gt;
Zayn Bilkadi ([[University of California, Berkeley]]), "The Oil Weapons", ''[[Saudi Aramco World]]'', January–February 1995, p. 20-27.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the transition period some lamps had Arabic writing. Then writing disappears until the [[Mamluk]] period (13th to 15th centuries AD).

=== Industrial age ===

Oil-burning carriage lamps provided a model for the first bicycle lamps in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;

==Regional variations==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2015}}

===Israel===
*Jerusalem oil lamp: Characteristic black color of the clay because the clay was burned without oxygen. Usually of high quality.
*Daroma oil lamp:
*Jerash oil lamp:
*Nabatean oil lamp:
*Herodian oil lamp: Considered to be used mainly by Jews. Wheel made, rounded. Nozzle with concave sides. The lamps are usually not decorated. If there is decoration, it tends to be simple. Very common throughout all of Israel, and some lamps have also been found in Jordan. Date from the 1st century BC to the end of the 1st century AD.
*[[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah oil lamp]], seven nozzles: Rare and are associated with Judaism because of the numerical connection with the seven branches or arms of the Menorah.
*Samaritan oil lamp: Characterized by a sealed filling hole, which was to be broken by the buyer. This was probably done to ensure ritual purity. A wider spout, and the concavities flanking the nozzle are almost always emphasized with a ladder pattern band. In general the lamps are uncoated. The decorations are linear and/or geometric.
**Type I: A distinct channel running from the pouring-hole to the nozzle, a small knob handle, a ladder pattern around the nozzle and shows no ornamentation on the bottom of the base.
**Type II: Pear-shaped and elongated, lined channel that extends from the filling-hole to the nozzle, continued to be used through to the early Muslim period.
*Candle Stick oil lamp: Menorah design on the nozzle and bunch of grapes on the shoulders.
*Byzantine oil lamp: The upper parts are covered with braided patterns and their handles.  All are made of a dark orange-red clay. A rounded bottom with a distinct X or cross appears inside the circled base.
*Early Islamic oil lamp: Large knob handle and the channel above the nozzle are dominant elements. The handle is tongue-shaped. Decoration is rich and elegant. The lower parts are extremely broad and the nozzles are pointed.

=== Importance of oil lamps in India ===
[[Image:Diya.jpg|thumb|A basic earthen oil lamp used for [[Diwali]]]]
[[Image:Diya-1.JPG|thumb|Traditional Indian earthenware oil lamp or [[diya (light)|diya]]]]

In [[Vedic period|Vedic times]], fire was kept alive in every household in some form and carried with oneself while migrating to new locations. Later the presence of fire in the household or a religious building was ensured by an oil lamp. Over the years various rituals and customs were woven around an oil lamp.

For ''Deep Daan'', the gift of a lamp was and still is believed to be the best daan (donation). During marriages, spinsters of the household stand behind the bride and groom, holding an oil lamp to ward off evil. The presence of an oil lamp is an important aspect of ritual worship (the Shodashopachar Puja) offered to a deity. Moreover, a day is kept aside for the worship of the lamp in the busy festival calendar, on one amavasya (no moon) day in the month of [[Shravan]]. This reverence for the deep is based on the symbolism of the journey from darkness and ignorance to light and the knowledge of the ultimate reality – "tamaso ma jyotirgamaya".

Earlier lamps were made out of stone or seashells. The shape was like a circular bowl with a protruding beak. Later they were replaced by earthen and metal lamps. In the epics [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]], there are references to gold and silver lamps as well. The simple shape evolved and the lamps were created in the shapes of the matsya (fish), kurma (Tortoise) and other incarnations of god [[Vishnu]] and also in the shape of the many emblems of gods like conch shells, lotuses and so on. The birds like swans, peacocks, parrots and animals like snakes, lions, elephants and horses were also favorites when decorating a lamp. For lighting multiple lamps, wooden and stone deepastambhas (towers of light) were created.

[[File:Lighting-a-lamp.jpg|thumb|left|Lighting of a ''Kuthuvilakku'']]
Erecting a deepastambha in front of a temple is still a general practice in western and southern India. In some of the South Indian temples, raised lamp towers called Kamba Vilakku made of brass can be seen. For adapting the design to households and smaller spaces, the deepavriksha (tree of light) was formed. As the name suggests, it is a metal lamp container with aesthetically curvi-linear lines branching out from the base each holding a lamp. The Deepalakshmi is another common design where goddess Lakshmi holds the lamp in her hands. Kuthuvilakku is another typical lamp traditionally used for household purposes in South India.

Oil lamps also became proverbial. For example, a Bradj (pre-Hindi) proverb says, "Chiraag tale andhera", "the [utmost] darkness is under the oil-lamp (chiraag)", meaning that what you seek could be close but unnoticed (right under your nose or feet), in various senses (and indeed, a lamp's container casts a strong shadow).

== Oil tax ==
When the [[Brihadeeswarar Temple|Big Temple]] in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu was built, there were elaborate measures taken to provide lighting for the temple. Lands were donated to or conquered for the temple for this sole objective. The income from these lands would go towards providing the oil for the lights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=O1b1N_Dx0jsC&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Royal Temple of Rajaraja: An Instrument of Imperial Cola Power'' by ''Geeta Vasudevan'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pelliotcave2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Paul Pelliot]] examines manuscripts in [[Mogao Caves|cave 17]]]]

The '''''Old Tibetan Chronicle''''' is a collection of narrative accounts and songs relating to Tibet's [[List of emperors of Tibet|Yarlung dynasty]] and the [[Tibetan Empire]]. The three manuscripts that comprise the only extant copies of the Chronicle are among the [[Dunhuang Manuscripts]] found in the early 20th century in the so-called "hidden library" at the [[Mogao Grottoes]] near [[Dunhuang]], which is believed to have been sealed in the 11th century CE. The ''Chronicle'', together with the [[Old Tibetan Annals]] comprise Tibet's earliest extant history.&lt;ref&gt;Dotson (2009), p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
An enormous number of early manuscripts in a variety of languages were collected by [[Aurel Stein]] and [[Paul Pelliot]] at the famous sealed-up Library Cave (no. 17) of the Mogao Grottoes at Dunhuang and sent back to London and Paris respectively. The ''[[Dunhuang manuscripts]]'' in the Tibetan language include the Old Tibetan Chronicle, which was probably compiled in the early 9th century, and the [[Old Tibetan Annals]], which have been described as "the first and single most important documents available on early Tibetan history."&lt;ref&gt;"Forward" by Per Sørensen in (Dotson (2009), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Old Tibetan Chronicle'' is extant in two manuscripts in the [[Paul Pelliot|Pelliot]] Collection at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in Paris, and some manuscript fragments. The main scroll comprises Pelliot tibétain 1286 and Pelliot tibétain 1287. The Tibetan text is written on the blank verso sides of panels pasted together from Chinese scrolls. In the first critical edition of Pelliot tibétain 1286 and Pelliot tibétain 1287, Jacques Bacot and Charles Toussaint considered them to be represent separate texts and referred to Pelliot tibétain 1286 as "Principautés anciennes et généalogie des rois," but following the suggestion of [[Uray Geza|Geza Uray]], both are now considered to be two parts a single original manuscript and can be referred to together as the Old Tibetan Chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;Uray (1968): pp.124–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, two folios from a single original manuscript, Pelliot tibétain 1144 and IOL Tib J 1375, overlap with narratives found in the Chronicle, though differing in certain details.

== Contents ==
The ''Old Tibetan Chronicle'' is a composite text of various lists, narratives and bardic songs arranged to form a single account of the reigns of the [[List of emperors of Tibet|Tibetan emperors]]. As the list of the Tibetan emperors found in the narrative ends with U Dumten ('U'i dum brtan), later known as [[Langdarma]], the ''Chronicle'' must have been compiled during or soon after the reign of this emperor, that is, in the 840s.&lt;ref&gt;Uray (1968): 124-5&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uray Geza|Geza Uray]] has argued that this composition was made in [[Dunhuang]] itself rather than Central Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Uray (1968): 135&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chronicle begins with a series of lists - of marriage alliances, principalities, emperors and ministers. The list of emperors is prefaced by an account of the descent of the first emperor [[Nyatri Tsenpo]] (gNya'-khri bTsan-po) from heaven, and ends with an account of the death of [[Drigum Tsenpo]], the first mortal in the line. After this the Chronicle narrates the overthrow of the prince Zingpoje - this narrative is also represented in the fragmentary Version II of the Chronicle. The narrative then continues with an account of the following Tibetan emperors before coming to the reign of [[Songtsen Gampo]] (r. c.605–649). This section actually concentrates on the activities of the minister [[Khyungpo Pungse]]. The Chronicle then continues with a narrative of the following emperors, before coming to [[Trisong Detsen]] (r. 756-c.800), in which his victory over the rival Tibetan king Lig Myi-rhya is celebrated. The Chronicle then returns to the reign of an earlier emperor [[Tridu Songtsen]] (676-704), and his victory over a claim to rule Tibetan by the Gar clan.

The Chronicle does not offer a comprehensive account of the history of Tibet. This is partly because of the nature of its composition from earlier narratives and songs. It has also been argued by [http://www.bibl.u-szeged.hu/~clio/html/ligeti/liglife.htm Lajos Ligeti] and [[Uray Geza|Geza Uray]] that the material in the Chronicle represents the interests of specific Tibetan clans, namely the Dba' and Myang clans (Ligeti adds the Mnon and Tshe-spong clans as well).&lt;ref&gt;Uray (1968): 136–7&lt;/ref&gt; In this it is comparable to another early Tibetan historical text, the [[Testament of Ba]], which represents the interests of the Dba' clan. Contradicting later Tibetan Buddhist histories, neither the ''Annals'' nor the ''Chronicle'' make any mention of Buddhism in the reign of [[Songtsen Gampo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianart.com/articles/heller2/preface.html "Preface to the Asianart.com edition of this article."] By Amy Heller, Jan 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Chronicle'' does say that, during the reign of king  [[Trisong Detsen]] (Khri srong lde brtsan- ruled from 755 to 797 or 804 CE), "The incomparable religion of the Buddha had been received and there were [[vihara]]s (monasteries) in the centre as well as the borderlands of the country."&lt;ref&gt;Bacot, Thomas and Toussaint (1940-1946), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems with chronology==
It has been clear since the Chronicle was first published that there are problems with its chronology. The victory over Lig Myi-rhya is narrated in the section on [[Trisong Detsen]], yet in the victory song and the following narrative the emperor named is [[Songtsen Gampo]], who ruled over a century earlier. Furthermore, the Chronicle ends in the reign of  [[Tridu Songtsen]] (676-704), which should come between [[Songtsen Gampo]] and [[Trisong Detsen]]. There are two main theories regarding this anachronism. Ariane Macdonald and Yoshiro Imaeda have argued that the problems with chronology arose because the Chronicle was composed from a variety of different sources.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald and Imaeda (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uray Geza|Geza Uray]] on the other hand has argued that the scroll of Pelliot tibétain 1287 was cut up and rearranged some time after it was originally written, and the chronological problem results from this. He suggests that this later cutting and pasting may have been done specifically in order to associate the conquest of Lig Myi-rhya with the emperor [[Trisong Detsen]], pointing out that the [[Bonpo]] historical tradition also makes that association.&lt;ref&gt;Uray (1968): 135–6&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Omphalion''' in Greek means "navel (of the earth)"; compare the ''[[omphalos]]'' of [[Delphi]].

==Hagia Sophia==
[[File:Omphalion ste-sophie istanbul 15 oct 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Omphalion at the [[Hagia Sophia]] (2011)]]
One of the most intriguing features of [[Hagia Sophia|St. Sophia]] is a marble section of the floor known as the Omphalos. The Omphalos is located in the south-east quarter of the main square beneath the dome, exactly in the middle of the square. Each side measures 5.65 meters (18.5 feet). Within the square lay 30 circles of various sizes. There is one large circle in the middle; 4 circles of equal size at each corner; 2 smaller circles of similar size occupy the space between each corner circle; 16 smaller circles in-between these. The 3 remaining circles are on the south end and are linked to the 4 larger circles on that end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pedone|first1=Silvia|title=The Marble Omphalos of Saint Sophia in Constantinople|date=2011|page=751}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most striking feature of the Omphalos is the brilliant [[marble]], with a myriad of types and colors mixed in. Marble was the material of choice for Imperial churches. Strangely, it was believed to be created by earthy matter freezing in water that had sunk into the Earth's crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barry|first1=Fabio|title=Walking on Water: Cosmic Floors in Antiquity and the Middle Ages|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=Dec 2007|volume=89|issue=4|url=https://search.proquest.com/artshumanities/docview/222978706/B6040F5BF77A497BPQ/7|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design is unusual and has been interpreted in many ways over the years. One interpretation could be that is that the central circle could be the sun, with the solar system orbiting around it. This would fit with the absolute rule of the Emperor. The asymmetry is particularly odd, given when compared to the omphalos at [[Hosios Loukas]] in Greece. This omphalos dates from the Middle Byzantine, some five hundred years after the St. Sophia's if it is indeed an original feature, and is completely symmetrical in design. Stylistically, the interiors of Hagia Sophia have been categorized as a "jeweled style".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schibille|first1=Nadine|title=Hagia Sophia and the Byzantine Aesthetic Experience|date=2014-11-28|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=9781472447951|page=98|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/psu/detail.action?docID=1808795|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The materials utilized were selected to retain and reflect light. The mosaics used [[Tessera|tesserae]] of varying colors, texturized and oriented to reflect the light pouring in from the massive dome. Color was very important as certain colors, and certain materials, conveyed messages of status and prestige. The effect of the sunlight shining through the windows surrounding the base of the dome hitting the tesserae would have been awe-inspiring. Comparatively, the Omphalos is more demure and understated.

Historically, it was thought to mark the spot where Byzantine emperors were crowned during the [[coronation]] ceremony. Evidence of this comes from [[Anthony of Novgorod|Antony of Novgorod]], who wrote a description of St. Sophia in the early 13th century. He wrote "there is a red marble stone with a golden throne placed on it. On this throne the emperors were crowned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pedone|first1=Silvia|title=The Marble Omphalos of Saint Sophia in Constantinople|date=2011|page=753}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been challenged over the years because of the dearth of textual reference from writers and travelers in the Byzantine Era. Hagia Sophia herself has been altered so many times since the sixth-century that the Omphalion disappears and re-appears sporadically in the textual evidence that does exist. We know that it was covered over with carpets by the Ottomans after they converted it into a mosque. The design is unique to Hagia Sophia, with little in the way of direct comparisons. There are two examples from the 11th and 12th centuries, [[Hosios Loukas|Hosios Lukas]] and [[Nea Moni of Chios|Nea Moni]]. The comparison is difficult considering the 500 year difference. All of the marble used in the floors of St. Sophia was quarried around the time of construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schibille|first1=Nadine|title=Hagia Sophia and the Byzantine Aesthetic Experience|date=2014-11-28|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=9781472447951|page=99|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/psu/detail.action?docID=1808795|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Byzantine architecture of the time favored the incorporation of [[spolia]] to celebrate the triumph of Christianity over Paganism, as much of the spolia was sourced from Greek and Roman temples throughout the Empire. Dating of the Omphalos has varied, with some dating it to the reign of Justinian, and some dating it as a later addition, particularly to the reign of Basil I (867-886). The evidence used to argue for this later dating is the seemingly odd placement within Hagia Sophia. However, it is placed in the center of one of the four squares beneath the dome, indicating the placement was not as random as it seems at first glance. Historian Nadine Schibille argues that it fits seamlessly into the original flooring, therefore she concludes that it was an original feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nadine|first1=Schibille|title=Hagia Sophia and the Byzantine Aesthetic Experience|date=2014-11-28|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=9781472447951|page=100|url=https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.lib.pdx.edu/lib/psu/detail.action?docID=1808795|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Silvia Pedone does not attempt to assign a specific date to it, but she theorizes that it was arranged differently than what is seen today. Some of the smaller circles might have been an addition during re-decoration in the 9th century. The church suffered damage during an earthquake in 1346 that could have damaged the marble. This could account for the asymmetrical design, with repairs altering the overall design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pedone|first1=Silvia|title=The Marble Omphalos of Saint Sophia in Constantinople|date=2011|page=763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Omphalia==
The word ''omphalion'' is also used to describe other sacred circular marking slabs that were usually located in important or especially sacred churches throughout the Byzantine Empire.

The marble omphalion from the floor of the Church of Hagia Sophia in [[Trabzon]] (north coast of modern Turkey) was brought to [[Thessalonica]] by Greek refugees in 1924.

The '''open-design movement''' involves the development of physical products, machines and systems through use of publicly shared design information. This includes the making of both [[free and open-source software]] (FOSS) as well as [[open-source hardware]]. The process is generally facilitated by the Internet and often performed without monetary compensation. The goals and philosophy of the movement are identical to that of the [[open-source movement]], but are implemented for the development of physical products rather than software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adciv.org/Open_collaborative_design |title=Open collaborative design |publisher=AdCiv |date=2010-07-29 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open design is a form of [[co-creation]], where the final product is designed by the users, rather than an external stakeholder such as a private company.

== Origin ==
Sharing of manufacturing information can be traced back to the 18th and 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Nuvolari, Alessandro 2004. Collective Invention during the British Industrial Revolution: The Case of the Cornish Pumping Engine. Cambridge Journal of Economics, 28, nr. 3: 347–363.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Robert C. 1983. Collective Invention. Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, 4, no. 1: 1–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Aggressive patenting put an end to that period of extensive knowledge sharing.&lt;ref&gt;Bessen, James E. and Nuvolari, Alessandro, Knowledge Sharing Among Inventors: Some Historical Perspectives (2012, forthcoming). In: Dietmar Harhoff and Karim Lakhani eds., Revolutionizing Innovation: Users, Communities and Open Innovation. Cambridge: MIT Press. Pre-Print: Boston Univ. School of Law, Law and Economics Research Paper No. 11-51; LEM Working Paper 2011/21. Available at http://www.bu.edu/law/faculty/scholarship/workingpapers/documents/BessenJ-NuvolariA101411fin.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
More recently, principles of open design have been related to the [[free software|free]] and [[open-source software|open-source]] software movements.&lt;ref name=ODMF&gt;Vallance, Kiani and Nayfeh, Open Design of Manufacturing Equipment, CIRP 1st Int. Conference on Agile, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 [[Eric S. Raymond]], [[Tim O'Reilly]] and [[Larry Augustin]] established "open source" as an alternative expression to "free software," and in 1997 [[Bruce Perens]] published [[the Open Source Definition]]. In late 1998, Dr. Sepehr Kiani (a PhD in mechanical engineering from MIT) realized that designers could benefit from open source policies, and in early 1999 he convinced Dr. Ryan Vallance and Dr. Samir Nayfeh of the potential benefits of open design in machine design applications.&lt;ref name=bazaar&gt;R. Ryan Vallance, Bazaar Design of Nano and Micro Manufacturing Equipment, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Together they established the [[Open Design Foundation]] (ODF) as a non-profit corporation, and set out to develop an Open Design Definition.&lt;ref name=bazaar/&gt;

The idea of open design was taken up, either simultaneously or subsequently, by several other groups and individuals. The principles of open design are closely similar to those of [[open-source hardware]] design, which emerged in March 1998 when Reinoud Lamberts of the [[Delft University of Technology]] proposed on his “Open Design Circuits” website the creation of a hardware design community in the spirit of free software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opencollector.org/history/OpenDesignCircuits/reinoud_announce |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812185631/http://www.opencollector.org/history/OpenDesignCircuits/reinoud_announce |archivedate=2007-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronen Kadushin coined the title "Open Design" in his 2004 Master’s thesis, and the term was later formalized in the 2010 Open Design Manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;

== Current directions ==
[[File:Open Source Ecology, Practical post scarcity.ogv|thumb|right|[[Open Source Ecology]], open source farming and industrial machinery]]
The open-design movement currently unites two trends. On one hand, people apply their skills and time on projects for the [[common good]], perhaps where funding or commercial interest is lacking, for [[developing country|developing countries]] or to help spread ecological or cheaper technologies. On the other hand, open design may provide a framework for developing advanced projects and technologies that might be beyond the resource of any single company or country and involve people who, without the [[copyleft]] mechanism, might not collaborate otherwise. There is now also a third trend, where these two methods come together to use high-tech open-source (e.g. 3D printing) but customized local solutions for [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;J. M Pearce, C. Morris Blair, K. J. Laciak, R. Andrews, A. Nosrat and I. Zelenika-Zovko, “3-D Printing of Open Source Appropriate Technologies for Self-Directed Sustainable Development”, Journal of Sustainable Development 3(4), pp. 17-29 (2010). [http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jsd/article/view/6984]&lt;/ref&gt; Open Design holds great potential in driving future innovation as resent research has proven that stakeholder users working together produce more innovative designs than designers consulting users through more traditional means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=Val|last2=Ross|first2=Tracy|last3=Sims|first3=Ruth|last4=Parker|first4=Christopher J.|title=Empirical investigation of the impact of using co-design methods when generating proposals for sustainable travel solutions|journal=CoDesign||date=2015|volume=12|issue=4|pages=205-220|doi=10.1080/15710882.2015.1091894|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15710882.2015.1091894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open machine design as compared to open-source software==

The open-design movement is currently fairly nascent but holds great potential for the future. In some respects design and engineering are even more suited to open collaborative development than the increasingly common open-source software projects, because with 3D models and photographs the concept can often be understood visually. It is not even necessary that the project members speak the same languages to usefully collaborate.

However, there are certain barriers to overcome for open design when compared to software development where there are mature and widely used tools available and the duplication and distribution of code cost next to nothing. Creating, testing and modifying physical designs is not quite so straightforward because of the effort, time and cost required to create the physical artefact; although with access to emerging flexible computer-controlled manufacturing techniques the complexity and effort of construction can be significantly reduced (see tools mentioned in the [[fab lab]] article).

== Organizations ==
[[File:VIA OpenBook CAD.jpg|thumb|[[VIA OpenBook]] reference design [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] visualisation]]

Open design is currently a fledgling movement consisting of several unrelated or loosely related initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Howard, Sofiane Achiche, Ali Özkil and Tim C. McAloone, Open Design And Crowdsourcing: Maturity, Methodology And Business

In some cases (e.g. [[Thingiverse]] for 3D printable designs or [[Appropedia]] for [[open source appropriate technology]]) organizations are making an effort to create a centralized open source design repository as this enables innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce J., Albritton S., Grant G., Steed G., &amp; Zelenika I. 2012.

In music, a '''radio edit''' is a modification, typically truncated, intended to make a song more suitable for [[airplay]], whether it be adjusted for length, [[profanity]], subject matter, instrumentation, or form. Radio edits may also be used for commercial single versions, which may be denoted as the ''7" version''.  However, not all "radio edit" tracks are played on radio.

==Editing for time==
Radio edits often shorten a long song in order to make it more commercially viable for radio stations. The normal length for songs played on the radio is 3 to 4 minutes.  Occasionally, the song will simply [[fade (audio engineering)|fade out]] earlier, common on tracks with long instrumental endings. For instance, the radio edit of '[[Heroes (David Bowie song)|Heroes]]' by [[David Bowie]] fades in shortly before the beginning of the third verse and fades out shortly before the vocal [[Ostinato#Vamp|vamping]] at the end of the song. Another example is [[B.o.B]]'s song, "[[Nothin' On You]]" featuring [[Bruno Mars]], whose radio edit skips the first 5 seconds &amp; starts with the 6th second in which Bruno Mars starts singing the first chorus. The second half of the first chorus is sometimes skipped, along with the last 24 seconds which is the normal fade-out part in which [[B.o.B]] says, "Yeah, and that's just how we do it/And I'ma let this ride/[[B.o.B]] and [[Bruno Mars]]", and the radio edit ends with the fourth and last chorus with an earlier fade-out. A 3rd example would be the song, "[[The Man (Aloe Blacc song)|The Man]]" by [[Aloe Blacc]], in which the radio edit skips the "I'm the man/Go ahead &amp; tell everybody/What I'm saying ya all" part &amp; the first 10 seconds. Also, the 3rd chorus of the song is shortened. However, many radio edits will also edit out verses, bridges, and interludes, such as the original single edit of "[[Piano Man (song)|Piano Man]]" by [[Billy Joel]] which substitutes the end of the third verse for the ending of the second verse. Another example for this case is [[Justin Timberlake]]'s "[[Mirrors (Justin Timberlake song)|Mirrors]]", where the radio edit cuts the entire "You are the love of my life" part.  Another example would be [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]]'s "[[Back That Thang Up]]" where [[Lil' Wayne]]'s outro is faded out in the "wobble de wop" part.

Some songs will be remixed heavily and feature different arrangements than the original longer versions, occasionally even being completely different recordings. A popular example of this is "[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]" by [[The Beatles]] which is a completely different recording from the version which appears on ''[[The Beatles (album)|The White Album]]''. Another example is [[Miley Cyrus]]'s "[[Adore You]]", whose original album version is a slow, quiet version clocking in at 4 minutes &amp; 37 seconds; the radio edit is a completely different version which is a remix done by [[Cedric Gervais]] running at 3 minutes &amp; 36 seconds. Likewise, an attempt at a radio edit for [[Arlo Guthrie]]'s 18-minute epic "[[Alice's Restaurant]]" scrapped the entire monologue that served as the main base of the song's popularity and instead was a 4-minute, three-verse rock and roll song. This also became more prevalent with the rise of the 12" record, as artists like [[New Order (band)|New Order]] started making songs specifically for the format. Many of the 7" mixes aimed for pop radio airplay of their songs feature very different arrangements, such as "[[Bizarre Love Triangle]]", or even a completely different recording, such as "[[Temptation (New Order song)|Temptation]]".

Some long songs do not have a radio edit, despite being as long as 5, 6, 7, or 8 minutes in length, presumably due to listener demand from radio stations. Examples of this include the following 10 songs: "[[Vicarious (Tool song)|Vicarious]]" (2006) by [[Tool (band)|Tool]] at 7 minutes and 6 seconds, "[[Hey Jude]]" (1968) by [[The Beatles]] at 7 minutes and 11 seconds long,  "[[You're the Voice]]" (1986) by John Farnham at 5 minutes and 4 seconds long, "[[Stairway to Heaven]]" (1971) by [[Led Zeppelin]] at 8 minutes and 3 seconds, "[[One (Metallica song)|One]]" (1989) by [[Metallica]] at 7 minutes and 24 seconds, "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]" (1971) by Don McLean with a length of 8 minutes and 32 seconds, "[[Me &amp; My Brother|Georgia Dome]]" (2004) by [[Ying Yang Twins]] (which actually has a radio edit but removing profanity &amp; not shortening it) at 6 minutes and 6 seconds, "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]" (1965) by [[Bob Dylan]] at 6 minutes &amp; 13 seconds, "[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]" (1975) by [[Elton John]] at 6 minutes &amp; 45 seconds, and "[[Again (Fetty Wap song)|Again]]" (2015) by [[Fetty Wap]] at 5 minutes and 13 seconds. The idea of extended songs receiving airplay on commercial radio was extremely rare until the birth of [[progressive rock (radio format)|progressive radio]] in the mid-1960s; most rock music formats descend from progressive radio, and as such, rock songs tend to be played at their longer original length than songs of other formats.

On rare occasions, a radio edit might be longer than the original album version. This may occur when the song is edited for form, such as in the cases of "[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]" by [[Radiohead (band)|Radiohead]], "[[2 On]]" by [[Tinashe]], and "[[Miserable (song)|Miserable]]" by [[Lit (band)|Lit]]. "[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]"'s radio edit has a 4-second drumstick count off before the regular first second, "[[2 On]]" repeats part of the chorus 1 more time than it does on the normal version, and [[Miserable (song)|Miserable]]'s radio edit adds the chorus between the first and second verses. Some radio edits lengthen some parts of the song while shortening others. For example, the radio edit of "[[Thinking Out Loud]]" by [[Ed Sheeran]] has a 6-second introduction before the first verse but later in the song cuts from the end of the second verse to the beginning of the last chorus, omitting the second chorus and the guitar solo. Different radio stations may edit songs differently for length; an example is "[[Uptown Funk]]" by [[Mark Ronson]] and [[Bruno Mars]]. Some radio stations cut the bridge and outro, some shorten the hooks and others go from the second chorus to the outro.

The syndicated radio format "QuickHitz", notably adopted by the [[Calgary]] radio station [[CKMP-FM]] in August 2014, utilizes even shorter edits of songs, from 1 minute and 30 seconds to 2 minutes in length.&lt;ref name=fp-ampquickhitz&gt;{{cite news|title=This Calgary radio station has started cutting songs in half so listeners don’t get bored|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2014/08/01/quickhitz-calgary-amp/|accessdate=1 August 2014|work=Financial Post|date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ri-ampcalgary&gt;{{cite web|title=Amp Radio Calgary relaunches with QuickHitz|url=http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/89494/amp-radio-calgary-prepping-relaunch/|website=RadioInsight|accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editing for content==

{{Listen |filename=Lily Allen Fuck You radio edit.ogg |title=Lily Allen, Fuck You (radio edit) |description=The radio edit version of [[Fuck You (Lily Allen song)|Fuck You]] by Lily Allen uses sound effects in place of the word 'Fuck' |pos=right}}

Radio edits often come with any necessary [[censorship]] done to conform to decency standards imposed by government agencies, such as the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in the [[United States]], the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] in [[Canada]], the [[Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas]] in the [[Philippines]], the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] in [[Australia]], and [[Ofcom]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The offending words may be silenced, reversed, distorted, or replaced by a [[Bleep censor|tone]] or sound effect. The edits may come from the record label itself, [[mass media|broadcasters]] at the corporate level before the song is sent for airplay to their stations, or in rarer cases, at a radio station itself depending on local standards. 

Some individual stations may be more lenient with words that tread the broadcast-appropriate line, depending on their management and programming format; for instance a [[rhythmic AC]], [[classic hits]], [[adult contemporary]] or [[urban contemporary]] station may indeed make several radio edits to a song to appeal to a broad base of listeners, while a [[rhythmic contemporary]], [[modern rock]] or [[hip-hop]]-focused station might be more apt to have a light hand in their radio edits to appeal both to listeners and artists who would be favorable to the station's reputation. Some edits might even be done for promotional reasons; for instance a song that mentions a city's name or a certain radio station might see a special 'station cut' where the station and its community are mentioned in the song (as heard in [[Lady Gaga]]'s "[[You and I (Lady Gaga song)|You and I]]", which has a reference to Nebraska that is easily substituted with another region, state or city; similarly [[Sia (musician)|Sia]]'s "[[Cheap Thrills (song)|Cheap Thrills]]" is sometimes edited to replace the line "turn the radio on" with "...turn [station name] on" to promote the radio station on which the song is playing).

One example would be "[[Dynamite (Taio Cruz song)|Dynamite]]" by [[Taio Cruz]], replacing the word, "fuck" with a sound effect. Another example is "[[Talk Dirty (Jason Derulo song)|Talk Dirty]]" by [[Jason Derulo]] featuring [[2 Chainz]], in which the radio edit omits 3 of the words present in the song: "penis", "sex", &amp; "pussy". "Penis" is replaced with an elephant sound effect, "sex" is replaced by an echo of the word "oral" that precedes it in the standard album version from ''[[Tattoos (album)|Tattoos]]'' &amp; ''[[Talk Dirty (album)|Talk Dirty]]'', &amp; "pussy" is replaced with a sound effect of a cat meowing. Occasionally, the song may be re-recorded with different lyrics, ranging from just the replacement of one line being re-recorded, like [[James Blunt]]'s "[[You're Beautiful]]," which replaces "fucking high" with "flying high" in the second verse, to the entire song be completely changed, such as [[D12]]'s "[[Purple Hills]]", which replaces profanity, drug references, and other inappropriate lyrics from the original "[[Purple Pills]]". Another example of the first type (one-line replacement) is [[The Black Eyed Peas]] song "[[Let's Get It Started]]", whose original title was "Let's Get Retarded" but was changed to make it suitable for radio play. [[Sean Kingston]]'s "[[Beautiful Girls (Sean Kingston song)|Beautiful Girls]]", in some radio edits, changed "You got me suicidal" to "in denial". The whole chorus of [[Cee Lo Green]]'s "Fuck You" substituted the word "Fuck" with "Forget", thus changing the title to "[[Fuck You (Cee Lo Green song)|Forget You]]" on the radio edit. In [[Bruno Mars]]' song "[[That's What I Like (Bruno Mars song)|That's What I Like]]", as played on ''[[The Steve Harvey Morning Show]]'', "You and your ass invited" is replaced by an instrumental version; the same occurs in the line, "Sex by the fire at night".

Radio edits may have more or fewer words edited than the "clean version", because of the stations' or agencies' standards.  An "amended" radio edit which only removes the major profanities while keeping the small profanities can be produced for some stations that allow small profanities (e.g. "[[You're Going Down]]" by [[Sick Puppies]] and "[[Bad Girlfriend]]" by [[Theory of a Deadman]]) whereas a "dirty" radio edit preserving the offensive language but maintaining the shorter play time may be produced, which may be aimed at club play, nighttime radio, and non-terrestrial radio stations. [[Kid Rock]] wrote the term "radio edit" into two of his songs, both of which are the same on radio and album versions. After two million copies of Michael Jackson's "[[They Don't Care About Us]]" had already been shipped, the lyrics of the original track with the words "Jew me" and "Kike me" were replaced with "do me" and "strike me" due to its controversial anti-Semitic references. Radio edit versions of the track remained with the original version until the edited version was pressed and released. An example occurs in [[Lady Gaga]]'s song "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]", where the line, "P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face" is misheard as, "P-p-p-poker face, p-p-fuck her face".  Some radio stations repeated the word "poker" from the first part of the line, while others played the original version.  A promotional CD single is available containing both of these versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Lady-Gaga-Poker-Face/release/11549829|title=Lady Gaga - Poker Face|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The edited version is available on the compilation ''[[Now That's What I Call Music! 31 (U.S. series)|Now 31]]'' in the US.

Major '''Robert Gill''' (1804–1879)&lt;ref name="Tombstone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buckland"&gt;{{harvnb|Buckland|1906|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an army officer, [[antiquarian]], painter and photographer in [[British India]].  He is best known for his paintings copying the [[fresco]]es of the [[Ajanta caves]].  Gill was the first painter&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;{{harvnb|Upadhyay|1994|p=1}} notes that Fide Jesus, a native, had drawn and lithographed these paintings before Robert Gill (c. 1836) those were published in 1847.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;–  after their rediscovery in 1819&amp;nbsp;–  to make extensive copies of the Buddhist cave paintings, which mostly date to the 5th century CE. His surviving copies and drawings remain significant in Ajanta studies as the originals have significantly deteriorated since his time.&lt;ref name="Patel"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Divia {{ndash}} Curator, Asian Department |last1=Patel |last2=Costaras |first2=Nicola {{ndash}} Head Paintings Conservator |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-52/conserving-the-copies-of-the-ajanta-cave-paintings-at-the-v-and-a/ |journal=Conservation Journal |title=Conserving the copies of the Ajanta cave paintings at the V&amp;A |publisher=[[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] |date=Spring 2006 |issue=52 |accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Family and military service===
Gill was born in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], London, the son of a stockbroker. He joined the [[Madras Army|44th Madras Native Infantry]] as a cadet in 1824 and became an [[ensign (military rank)|ensign]] on 6 May 1825. Promotion to Lieutenant followed in September 1826, and to Captain on 6 May 1840; finally he was promoted to Major.  On 25 May 1841, he married Frances Flowerdew Rickerby at [[St Luke's Church, Chelsea]], in London.&lt;ref&gt;Parish registers of St Luke's, Chelsea.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madras Military Fund records (1808–1862)&lt;/ref&gt;  He was discharged as an invalid on 1 October 1852.&lt;ref name="RootsWeb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon, 234–238"&gt;Gordon, 234–238&lt;/ref&gt; His first child, a daughter called Frances Eliza Minchin Gill (1842-1930), was born in Madras. His first son, the soldier, explorer and intelligence officer [[William John Gill]] (1843-1882), was born in [[Bangalore]].  A second daughter, Rose Matilda Gill, was born in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] in 1845 but died when less than three weeks old. A second son, the lawyer Robert Thomas Gill (1847-1927) was born in [[Jalna, Maharashtra|Jaulnah]], as was a third daughter, Lucy Annie Gill (1849-1903). Robert Gill may have had several children who died in infancy by his first Indian mistress, Paro. He had two daughters by his second Indian mistress: Mildred Mary Gill (1866-1923) and Annie Gill (c.1864-1934).&lt;ref&gt;Family history research by Tony Hadland, a descendant of Robert Gill.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ajanta dancing girl now and then.jpg|230px|thumb|Dancing girl in Ajanta fresco, showing deterioration between the cave now (left) and Gill's copy.&lt;ref&gt;Detail from this [https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O115444/copy-of-painting-inside-the-oil-painting-gill-robert/ painting in the V&amp;A]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Career===
Gill was a member of [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|The Royal Asiatic Society]], and this association was eventually parlayed into copying the murals that had first been published in a lecture by [[James Fergusson (architect)|James Fergusson]] to the Bombay branch of the Society, and later inclusion and illustration in his book in [[Indian rock-cut architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Fergusson's book was ''The Rock-cut Temples of India'', published in 1845. Gibson, pp 230–234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohatgi"/&gt; From 1844, Gill was taken away from military service to copy the Ajanta murals for the [[Asiatic Society of Bombay]], at an additional salary of 200 [[rupee]]s a year.  He spent thirty years measuring, mapping, cataloguing, photographing, and painting in the caves, despite dangers from wild animals and the local [[Bhil people]].&lt;ref name="Rohatgi"/&gt;

Arriving at Ajanta in early 1845, he completed an initial survey and inspection, submitting a report the same year. He began to ship completed paintings back to London in 1847, where many were exhibited at the museum of the [[East India Company]].  A number of them were reproduced, somewhat crudely, in an article in 1849 in the ''[[Illustrated London News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 235&lt;/ref&gt; He had copied about 30 of the principal [[fresco]]es on canvas at almost full-size by 1863, when the painting phase of his work largely ended; these works were sent to London.&lt;ref name="Gordon, 234–238"/&gt; Unfortunately, twenty-five of his pictures were burnt during the 1866 fire at [[The Crystal Palace]], where they were on loan and being exhibited.&lt;ref name="Buckland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohatgi"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Pauline |last1=Rohatgi |first2=Pheroza |last2=Godrej |date=March 2009 |chapter-url=http://www.illwa.org/chapter_8.htm |chapter=Reflections of Change |title=Indian Life and Landscapes by Western Artists |publisher=Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (CSMVS) |location=Mumbai |access-date=24 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907050817/http://www.illwa.org/chapter_8.htm |archive-date=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another was destroyed by a fire in a storeroom in the South Kensington Museum (now the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]) in 1885.  This was the same fire that destroyed most of the next generation of Ajanta copies, just completed by a team from the Bombay School of Art. None of Gill's lost copies had been photographed.  The four surviving Gill copies are in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London; a number of his drawings are in the [[British Library]].&lt;ref name="Gordon, 234–238"/&gt;

Gill remained based at Ajanta for the rest of his life, also making tours to other ancient sites in India. He took up photography, including [[stereoscopy]], in about 1856, and much of his photographic work is published in two books, ''The Rock-Cut Temples of India'',&lt;ref name="Bonhams"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/16200/lot/383/ |first1=James |last1=Ferguson |work=India and Beyond in Books and Photography |date=9 April 2008|format=[[Albumen print]]s|title=The Rock Cut Temples of India |publisher=[[Bonhams]] Auctioneer |accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''One Hundred Stereoscopic Illustrations of Architecture and Natural History in Western India'', with notes by [[James Fergusson (architect)|James Fergusson]].&lt;ref name="Buckland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon, 234–238"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohatgi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 236–238; {{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/g/019pho0001000s4u00455000.html |first1=Robert |last1=Gill |title=General view of Buddhist Caves II-XXVI, Ajanta|date=26 March 2009 |format=Photographic print |publisher=British Library |accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=One hundred stereoscopic illustrations of architecture and natural history in western India |first1=Robert, photographer |last1=Gill |first2=James, description |last2=Fergusson |year=1864 |publisher=Cundall, Downes |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gill's surviving photographs, drawings, and paintings are constantly cited by scholars of Ajanta and [[Indian art]] generally, as they have preserved the memories of original painted surfaces that have undergone significant flaking.  Accelerated deterioration began immediately upon the caves' rediscovery starting in 1819. According to the Victoria and Albert Museum, even in Gill's time the original cave paintings could be seen suffering damage from frequent, unsupervised visitation and also from "swarms of bees and bats."&lt;ref name="Patel"/&gt; Gill's works also record the condition of the stonework at the time; some sections have since been lost, such as the portico to Cave 1,&lt;ref&gt;Compare [http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/g/019pho0001000s4u00462000.html Gill's photo] with a [[:File:AjantaHoehle1VerandaPanorama.jpg|modern view]]&lt;/ref&gt; and others considerably repaired and tidied.  Many of his plans, drawings, and photographs are available online at the [[British Library]] and other places.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/index.html Search page for British Library online collections]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and burial===
Like many other British Indian officers of those days, Gill was an avid hunter and killed about 150 [[tigers]], mostly on foot.&lt;ref name="Buckland"/&gt; He died in 1879&lt;ref name="Tombstone"/&gt; while being transported from Ajanta to [[Bhusawal]] in a very ill condition,&lt;ref name="Buckland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohatgi"/&gt; and was buried at the Catholic Cemetery at Bhusawal.&lt;ref name="Gordon, 234–238"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56827">The '''SCO–Linux disputes''' are a series of legal and public disputes between the [[software]] company [[SCO Group]] (SCO) and various [[Linux]] vendors and users.  The SCO Group alleges that its license agreements with IBM means that [[source code]] that IBM wrote and donated to be incorporated into Linux was added in violation of SCO's contractual rights.  Members of the Linux community disagree with SCO's claims; [[IBM]], [[Novell]] and [[Red Hat]] have ongoing claims against SCO.

On August 10, 2007, a federal district court judge in ''SCO v. Novell'' ruled on summary judgment that Novell, not the SCO Group, is the rightful owner of the copyrights covering the Unix operating system. The court also ruled that "SCO is obligated to recognize Novell's waiver of SCO's claims against IBM and Sequent". After the ruling Novell announced they have no interest in suing people over Unix and stated "We don't believe there is Unix in Linux".&lt;ref name="doc377"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/Novell/Novell-377.pdf|title=MEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER Civil Case No. 2:04CV139DAK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Montalbano |first= Elizabeth | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,135959-c,unix/article.html | title= Novell Won't Pursue Unix Copyrights| publisher = PC World | date= 2007-08-15 | accessdate= 2007-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge Says Unix Copyrights Rightfully Belong to Novell |publisher = New York Times|date = 2007-08-11| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/11/technology/11novell.html | accessdate= 2007-08-15 | first=John | last=Markoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gl070810&gt;{{cite web|title=Court Rules: Novell owns the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights!

The court upheld the $2,547,817 award granted to Novell for the 2003 Sun agreement.&lt;ref name="Novell August 2009"/&gt;

On March 30, 2010, following a jury trial, Novell, and not The SCO Group, was unanimously found to be the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights.&lt;ref name=glNovell-846&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/pdf2/Novell-846.pdf|title=03/30/2010 - 846 - JURY VERDICT for Defendant Novell.

{{SCO Controversy}}

==Overview==
[[Unix]] is a major computer [[operating system]], developed in the [[United States of America]].  Prior to the events of this case, the [[intellectual property rights]] (IP) in Unix were held by [[Unix System Laboratories]] (USL), part of [[AT&amp;T]], but the area of IP ownership was complex.  By 2003, the rights in Unix had been transferred several times and there was dispute as to the correct owner in law. Also some of the code within Unix had been written prior to the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], or was developed by third parties, or was developed or licensed under different licenses existing at the time. The [[software]] company [[SCO Group]] (SCO), formerly [[Caldera International]], asserted in 2003 that it was the owner of Unix, and that other unix-type operating systems - particularly the [[free software|free operating system]] [[Linux]] and other variants of Unix sold by competitor companies - were violating their intellectual property by using Unix code without a license in their works.

SCO initially claimed, and tried to assert, a legal means to litigate directly against all end-users of these operating systems as well as the companies or groups providing them - potentially a very substantial case and one that would [[Fear, uncertainty and doubt|throw fear]] into the market about using them.  However it was unable to formulate such a case, since the Unix copyrights were weakly worded, there was no basis in patent law, and breach of trade secrets would only affect the one or few companies who might have been alleged to have disclosed trade secrets.  Lacking grounds to sue all users generally, SCO dropped this aspect of its cases.

The assertions were heavily contested. Claims of SCO's own copyright violations of these other systems were raised, along with claims related to SCO being bound by, or violating, the [[GPL]] licence, under which SCO conducted business related to these systems. Claims were also made that the case was substantially financed and promoted by [[Microsoft]] and investment businesses with links to Microsoft; around that time (1998 - 2004 onwards) Microsoft was fiercely engaged in various [[Fear, uncertainty and doubt|FUD]] tactics such as its ''Get the facts'' campaign, that sought to undermine or discredit Linux as a possible competitor to its own [[Windows]] operating systems and server systems.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Microsoft Halloween documents leak]] for more detail&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Microsoft takes on the free world | url = http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100033867/ | publisher = [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] via [[CNNMoney.com]] | first = Roger | last = Parloff | date = 2007-05-14 | accessdate = 2007-11-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071109190233/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100033867/ | archivedate = 2007-11-09 | df =  }}.

In the end, SCO launched only a few main legal cases - against [[IBM]] for improper disclosure and breach of copyright related to its [[AIX]] operating system, against [[Novell]] for interference (clouding the issue of ownership), against [[DaimlerChrysler]] for non-compliance with a demand to certify certain matters related to Unix usage, and against Linux business and former client [[AutoZone]] for violating SCO's rights by using Linux.  Separately, the Linux company [[Red Hat]] also filed a legal claim against SCO for making false claims that affected its (Red Hat's) business, and to seek a court declaration that SCO had no ownership rights in Linux code.

In 2007, a court ruled in ''SCO v. Novell'' that Novell and not SCO was the owner of the Unix copyrights. {{As of|2016}}, most of these cases have been resolved, or largely resolved, and none of the rulings have been in SCO's favor.

==Timeline and major cases==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2010}}
At the beginning of 2003, SCO claimed that there had been "misappropriation of its [[UNIX System V]] [[Source code|code]] into Linux". However, the company refused to identify the specific segments of code, claiming that it was a secret which they would reveal only to the court. They did say that the code could be found in the [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]], [[Read-copy-update|RCU]] and a few other parts of the [[Linux kernel]].

On 6 March 2003 they announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1016-991464.html|title=SCO sues Big Blue over Unix, Linux|date=11 March 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that they were suing IBM for $1&amp;nbsp;billion, claiming that IBM transferred SCO [[trade secret]]s into Linux. That amount later rose to $3&amp;nbsp;billion, and then again to $5 billion.

Some educated parties{{Who|date=March 2011}} note that the ''[[USL v. BSDi]]'' case had shown that the Unix copyrights are weak and unenforceable. SCO has not claimed [[patent infringement]], as according to the [[US Patent and Trademark Office]] database, no [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] or Novell patent was ever assigned to SCO. The UNIX [[trademark]] was not owned by SCO. That left arguing over trade secrets, which after some opposition, was hard to take beyond a breach of contract between SCO and IBM, and consequentially a claim only against IBM. SCO was looking for something directed at the greater Linux community, and has since explicitly dropped all trade secret claims from their case.

SCO now had little legal ground at this point and therefore began numerous legal claims and threats against many of the major names in the computer industry, including IBM, [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Microsoft]], Novell, [[Silicon Graphics]], [[Sun Microsystems]] and Red Hat.

By mid-2004, five major lawsuits had been filed:

* ''[[SCO v. IBM]]''
* ''[[Red Hat v. SCO]]''
* ''[[SCO v. Novell]]'' (not directly related to Linux, the suit has more to do with Unix copyrights)
* ''[[SCO v. DaimlerChrysler]]''
* ''[[SCO-Linux controversies#SCO v. AutoZone|SCO v. AutoZone]]''

In cases SCO publicly implied that a number of other parties have committed copyright infringement, including not only Linux developers but also Linux users.

==UNIX SVRx==
SCO's claims are derived from several contracts that may have transferred UNIX System V Release 4 intellectual property assets.  The UNIX IP rights originated with [[Unix System Laboratories]] (USL), a division of AT&amp;T.  In 1993, USL sold all UNIX rights and assets to Novell, including copyrights, trademarks, and active licensing contracts. Some of these rights and assets, plus additional assets derived from Novell's development work, were then sold to the [[Santa Cruz Operation]] in 1995.  The Santa Cruz Operation had developed and was selling a PC-based UNIX until 2000, when it then resold its UNIX assets to [[Caldera Systems]], which later reorganized into [[Caldera International]] and changed its name to [[SCO Group]].

Through this chain of sales, SCO claims to be the "owner of UNIX". The validity of these claims is hotly contested by others. SCO claims copyright to all UNIX code developed by USL, referred to as [[UNIX System V|SVRx]], and licensing contracts originating with AT&amp;T, saying that these are inherited through the same chain of sales. The primary document SCO presents as evidence of these claims is the "Asset Purchase Agreement",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/SCONovellAssetAg.pdf|title=in the original] or [http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=2003111023050367&amp;query=asset+purchase+agreement transcribed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defining the sale between Novell and the Santa Cruz Operation. SCO says that this includes all copyrights to the UNIX code base and contractual rights to the licensing base. The other parties disagree.

===UNIX copyrights ownership===
The status of copyrights from USL is murky, since UNIX code is a compilation of elements with different copyright histories.  Some code was released without copyright notice before the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] made copyright automatic.  This code may be in the [[public domain]] and not subject to copyright claims.  Other code is affected by the ''[[USL v. BSDi]]'' case, and is covered by the [[BSD License]].

[[Groklaw]] uncovered an old settlement made between Unix System Laboratories (USL) and The University of California in the case of [[USL v. BSDi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/USLsettlement.pdf|title=The full settlement available from Groklaw's website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This settlement ended a copyright infringement suit against the University for making [[BSD]] [[source code]] freely available that USL felt infringed their copyrights. The university filed a counter suit, saying that USL had taken BSD source code and put it in UNIX without properly acknowledging the university's copyright. This settlement muddies the question of SCO's ownership of major parts of the UNIX source code. This uncertainty is particularly significant in regard to SCO's claims against Linux, which uses some BSD code.

Novell challenges SCO's interpretation of the purchase agreement.  In response to a letter SCO sent to 1500 companies on May 12, 2003,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novell.com/licensing/indemnity/pdf/5_12_03_sco-n.pdf May 12, 2003 letter to Novell Chairman and CEO Jack Messman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040717052204/http://www.novell.com/licensing/indemnity/pdf/5_12_03_sco-n.pdf |date=July 17, 2004 }} hosted by Novell.&lt;/ref&gt; Novell exchanged a series of letters&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novell.com/licensing/indemnity/legal.html Novell's Unique Legal Rights&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040806125142/http://www.novell.com/licensing/indemnity/legal.html |date=August 6, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with SCO beginning in May 2003, claiming that the copyrights for the core UNIX System V were not included in the asset purchase agreement and are retained by Novell.  In October 2003, Novell registered those copyrights with the US Copyright Office.

In response to these challenges from Novell, SCO filed a "[[slander of title]]" suit against Novell, ''[[SCO v. Novell]]''.  This claimed that Novell was interfering with their business activities by clouding the ownership of UNIX copyrights. SCO's claim for special damages was dismissed on June 9, 2004 for "failure to specifically plead special damages."&lt;ref name="kimbal_order"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/Novell-29.pdf|title=Judge Kimbal's Order available from Groklaw's website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, SCO was given 30 days "to amend its complaint to more specifically plead special damages". In the same ruling,  the judge stated that it was questionable whether or not the Asset Purchase Agreement transferred the relevant copyrights, reasoning that the ASA amendment by which SCO was claiming to have acquired those rights contained no transfer language in the form of "seller hereby conveys to buyer" and that it used ambiguous language when it came to the question of when and how and which rights were to be transferred.&lt;ref name="kimbal_order" /&gt;{{rp|9}}

SCO filed an amended complaint. In late July, 2005, Novell filed an answer to SCO's complaint, denying all of its accusations. Novell also filed its own Slander of Title counter-lawsuit against SCO. Novell has also filed claims for numerous breaches of the APA (Asset Purchase Agreement) between Novell and the [[Santa Cruz Operation]]. Under the APA, Santa Cruz (and later SCO after SCO purchased Santa Cruz Operation's Unix Business) was given the right to market and sell Unixware as a product, retaining 100% of all revenues. Santa Cruz Operation (and later SCO) also was given the responsibility of administering Unix SVR4 license agreements on behalf of Novell. When money was paid for licensing, SCO was to turn over 100% of the revenue to Novell, and then Novell would return 5% as an Administration Fee. Novell claims that SCO signed Unix SVR4 licensing agreements with Microsoft and Sun Microsystems, as well as with numerous Linux End Users for Unix IP allegedly in the Linux Kernel, and then refused to turn the money over to Novell. Novell is suing for 100% of the revenue, claiming SCO is not entitled to the 5% administration fee since they breached their contract with Novell. Novell's counterclaims proposed asking the court to put appropriate funds from SCO into escrow until the case is resolved, since SCO's cash is diminishing quickly.

Novell also retained the right to audit SCO's Unix Licensing Business under the APA. Novell claims that SCO has not turned over vital information about the Microsoft, Sun, and Linux End User License Agreements, despite repeated demands by Novell for them to do so. Novell, in another claim that is part of their counter suit, is asking the court to compel SCO to allow Novell to perform this audit of SCO's Unix Business.

On August 10, 2007 Judge Dale Kimball, hearing the SCO v. Novell case, ruled that "...the court concludes that Novell is the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare Copyrights".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/Novell/Novell-377.pdf|title=Memorandum order and decision, document 377 in case 2:04CV139DAK], the court order on [[Groklaw]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="novell379"&gt;[https://www.novell.com/communities/coolsolutions/novell-statement-on-todays-sco-ruling/ Novell statement on today’s SCO ruling], Novell Open PR, 2007-08-10&lt;/ref&gt;

===License administration standing===
The Novell to Santa Cruz Operation Asset Purchase Agreement also involved the administration of some 6000 standing licensing agreements between various UNIX users and the previous owners.  These licensees include universities, software corporations and computer hardware companies. SCO's claimed ownership of the licenses has become an issue in three aspects of the SCO–Linux controversies. The first was the cancellation of IBM's license, the second was SCO's complaint against DaimlerChrysler (see ''[[SCO v. DaimlerChrysler]]''), and the third is the derivative works claim of the ''[[SCO v. IBM]]'' case.

In May 2003, SCO canceled IBM's SVRx license to its version of UNIX, [[AIX operating system|AIX]].  This was based on SCO's claim of unrestricted ownership of the System V licensing contracts inherited from USL. IBM ignored the license cancellation, claiming that an amendment to the original license&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20031107212034397|title=Groklaw - Amendment X as Text|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; made it "irrevocable."  In addition, as part of the Purchase Agreement, Novell retained certain rights of control over the administration of the licenses which were sold, including rights to act on SCO's behalf in some cases.  Novell exercised one of these rights by revoking SCO's cancellation of the IBM license.  SCO disputed the validity of both of these actions, and amended its ''SCO v. IBM'' complaint to include copyright infringement, based on IBM's continued sale and use of AIX without a valid SVRx license.

In December 2003, SCO demanded that all UNIX licensees certify some items, some related to the use of Linux, that were not provided for in the license agreement language.  Since DaimlerChrysler failed to respond, SCO filed the ''SCO v. DaimlerChrysler'' suit in March 2004.  All claims related to the certification demands were summarily dismissed by the court.

===Control of derivative works===
The third issue based on the UNIX licensees agreement is related to SCO's claims of control of derivative works.

Many UNIX licensees have added features to the core UNIX SVRx system and those new features contain computer code not in the original SVRx code base. In most cases, software copyright is owned by the person or company that develops the code. SCO, however, claims that the original licensing agreements define this new code as a [[derivative work]]. They also claim that they have the right to control and restrict the use and distribution of that new code.

These claims are the basis of ''SCO v. IBM''. SCO's initial complaint,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/IBM/complaint3.06.03.html|title=The SCO Group v|website=sco.tuxrocks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that IBM violated the original licensing agreement by not maintaining confidentiality with the new code, developed and copyrighted by IBM, and releasing it to the Linux project.

IBM claims that the license agreement (noted in the $Echo newsletter of April 1985)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040211153230800|title=Groklaw - $ echo  April 1985|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent licenses defines derivative works as the developer's property.  This leaves IBM free to do as it wishes with its new code.  In August 2004, IBM filed a motion for partial summary judgment.  The motion stated that IBM has the right to do as it wishes with software not part of the original SVRx code. In February 2005, the motion was dismissed as premature, because discovery was not yet complete. IBM refiled this motion along with other summary judgment motions as noted below in September 2006.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}&lt;!--WP:WEIGHT?--&gt;

===SCO allegations of copyright and trade secret violations===
SCO claims that Linux infringes SCO's [[copyright]], [[trade secrets]], and contractual rights. This claim is fundamental to the [[SCOsource]] program, where SCO has demanded that Linux users obtain licenses from SCOsource to be properly licensed to use the code in question. Exactly which parts of Linux are involved remains unclear as many of their claims are still under seal in the ''SCO v. IBM'' lawsuit.

SCO originally claimed in ''SCO v. IBM'' that IBM had violated trade secrets. But these alleged violations by IBM would not have involved Linux distributors or end users. SCO's trade secret claims were dropped by SCO in their amended complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/IBM/Doc-25.html|title=The SCO Group v|website=sco.tuxrocks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCO also claimed line-for-line literal copying of code from UNIX code files to Linux kernel files and obfuscated copying of code, but originally refused to publicly identify which code was in violation.  SCO submitted to the court evidence of their claims under seal but much of it was excluded from the case after it was challenged by IBM as not meeting the specificity requirements to be included.

These examples have fallen into two groups.  The first are segments of files or whole files alleged to originate in UNIX SVRx code such as the [[errno.h]] header file. The second group are files and materials contributed by IBM that originated with IBM development work associated with AIX and [[Dynix]], IBM's two UNIX products.

Each of these has a different set of issues. In order for copyright to be violated, several conditions must be met. First, the claimant must be able to show that they own the copyrights for the material in question. Second, all or a significant part of the source must be present in the infringing material. There must be enough similarity to show direct copying of material.

====SVRx code allegedly in Linux====
The issue of ownership of the SVRx code base was discussed [[SCO-Linux controversies#UNIX SVRx|above]].  Besides the unresolved issue of what was actually transferred from Novell to Santa Cruz Operation, there are also the portions of the SVRx code base that are covered by BSD copyrights or that are in the public domain.

SCO's first public disclosure of what they claim is infringing code was at [[The SCO Group#History|SCO Forum]] in August 2003.  The first, known as the [[Berkeley Packet Filter]], was distributed under the BSD License and is freely usable by anyone.  The second example was related to memory allocation functions, also released under the BSD License. It is no longer in the Linux code base.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Perens, [http://perens.com/Articles/SCO/SCOSlideShow.html Analysis of SCO's Las Vegas Slide Show]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406055034/http://perens.com/Articles/SCO/SCOSlideShow.html |date=April 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCO has also claimed that code related to [[application programming interface]]s was copied from UNIX.  However, this code and the underlying standards they describe are in the public domain and are also covered by rights USL sold to [[The Open Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Perens, [http://www.zdnet.com.au/insight/software/0,39023769,39116509,00.htm SCO's failing case against IBM], zdnet.com.au, March 10, 2004. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050213234612/http://www.zdnet.com.au/insight/software/0,39023769,39116509,00.htm |date=February 13, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A later claim was made to code segments related to [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]] file format standards.  This material was developed by the Tool Interface Standard (TIS) Committee and placed in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040722135616439|title=Groklaw - A Tall Tale About ELF - by Frank Sorenson, Dr Stupid and PJ|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SCO claims that the TIS Committee had no authority to place ELF in the public domain, even though SCO's predecessor in interest was a member of the committee.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

SCO has claimed that some are violating UNIX SVRx copyrights by putting UNIX code into Linux.  They may or may not have brought this claim directly in any of their cases.  The IBM case is about derivative works, not SVRx code (see below).  The Novell case is about copyright ownership.  DaimlerChrysler was about contractual compliance statements.

The "may or may not" comes from AutoZone's case.{{Original research inline|date=September 2007}}  In AutoZone, SCO's complaint claimed damages for AutoZone's use of Linux.  However, when objecting to AutoZone's request for a stay pending the IBM case, SCO apparently contradicted their written complaint, claiming that the case was entirely about AutoZone copying certain libraries (outside the Linux kernel) from a UNIX system to a Linux-based system to facilitate moving an internal application to the Linux platform faster; SCO's original complaint does not appear to mention these libraries.  AutoZone denies having done this with UNIX libraries.  If SCO's oral description of their case is the correct one, then their AutoZone claim has nothing to do with the Linux kernel or the actions of any distributors.

The copyright issue is addressed directly in two of the cases. The first is by IBM in their counterclaim in ''SCO v. IBM''.  The issue is central to a pending motion by IBM, stating that IBM violated no copyrights in its Linux related activities.  It is also addressed by Red Hat in the Red Hat v. SCO case.  Red Hat claims that SCO's statements about infringement in Linux are unproven and untrue, damaging to them and violates the [[Lanham Act]].  Red Hat asks for an injunction to stop claims of violations without proof.  They also ask for a judgment that they violated no SCO copyrights.  A hearing on the IBM motion was held on September 15, 2004. Judge Kimball took the motion under advisement. The Red Hat case is on hold.

====Allegations of reverse copying====
''EWeek'' has reported allegations that SCO may have copied parts of the Linux kernel into SCO UNIX as part of its Linux Kernel Personality feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1653684,00.asp|title=HP TouchPad Needs 6 to 8 Weeks for Additional Shipments|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If true, this would mean that SCO is guilty of a breach of the Linux kernel copyrights. SCO has denied this allegation, but according to Groklaw, one SCO employee confirmed it in a deposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050809082902461|title=Groklaw -  Erik Hughes Deposition:  LKP Did Include Linux Kernel Code|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====IBM code in Linux====
SCO has claimed a number of instances of IBM Linux code as breaches of contract. These examples include code related to [[Symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP), [[Journaled File System]] (JFS), [[Read-copy-update]] (RCU) and [[Non-Uniform Memory Access]] (NUMA). This code is questionably in the Linux kernel,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} and may have been added by IBM through the normal kernel submission process. This code was developed and copyrighted by IBM. IBM added features to AIX and Dynix.

SCO claims that they have "control rights" to this due to their licensing agreements with IBM. SCO disavows claiming that they own the code IBM wrote, rather comparing their "control rights" to an [[easement]], rights which allow them to prohibit IBM from publicizing the code they wrote, even though IBM owns the copyrights. They base this claim on language in the original license agreement that requires non-disclosure of the code and claim that  all code developed by UNIX licensees that is used with the code under license be held in confidence. This claim is discussed above at [[#Control of derivative works|Control of derivative works]].

===SCO and the GPL===
Before changing their name to the SCO Group, the company was known as '''Caldera International'''.

[[Caldera (company)|Caldera]] was one of the major distributors of Linux between 1994 and 1998. In August 1998, the company split into [[Caldera Systems]] and [[Caldera Thin Clients]], with Caldera Systems taking over the Linux systems business and Caldera Thin Clients concentrating on the Thin Clients and embedded business. The parent and shell company Caldera, Inc. ceased to exist in 2000 after a settlement with Microsoft in the [[Caldera v. Microsoft]] lawsuit.

Caldera Systems was reorganized to become Caldera International in 2001, the company, which was renamed to [[The SCO Group]] in 2002.

Some, like [[Eben Moglen]],&lt;ref name="fsf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsf.org/licensing/sco/sco-v-ibm.html|title=FSF Statement on SCO v. IBM|date=2003-06-27|author=Moglen, Eben|publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]], Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that because Caldera{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;!-- TBD: Please be specific about which of the various Caldera companies is meant here --&gt; distributed the allegedly infringing code under the [[GNU General Public License]], or GPL, that this act would license any proprietary code in Linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/2207791|title=SCO Faces Hurdles in Linux Claims - InternetNews.|website=www.internetnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCO has stated that they did not know their own code was in Linux, so releasing it under the GPL does not count. However, as late as July and August 2006, long after that claim was made, they were still distributing ELF files (the subject of one of SCO's claims regarding SVRx) under the GPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060731122623203|title=Groklaw - SCO is Distributing ELF Under the GPL Still. Yes.  Now. Today.|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060806074745174|title=Groklaw - SCO  Is Still Distributing ELF Under the GPL, Part 2.|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCO has also claimed, in early stages of the litigation, that the GPL is invalid and non-binding and legally unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1404984,00.asp|title=HP TouchPad Needs 6 to 8 Weeks for Additional Shipments|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, supporters of the GPL, such as Eben Moglen, claimed that SCO's right to distribute Linux relied upon the GPL being a valid copyright license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetnews.com/ent-news/article.php/3302801|title=GPL Awaits Test in SCO Group/IBM Dispute - InternetNews.|website=www.internetnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later court filings by the SCO Group in ''SCO v. IBM'' use SCO's alleged compliance with the license as a defense to IBM's counterclaims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=2007020910561488|title=Groklaw - SCO's Memo in Opp. to IBM's Motion for SJ on Claim of Copyright Infringement|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GPL has become an issue in ''SCO v. IBM''. Under U.S. copyright law, distribution of creative works whose copyright is owned by another party is illegal without permission from the copyright owner, usually in the form of a license; the GPL is such a license, and thus allows distribution, but only under limited conditions. Since IBM released the relevant code under the terms of the GPL, it claims that the only permission that SCO has to copy and distribute IBM's code in Linux is under the terms and conditions of the GPL, one of which requires the distributor to "accept" the GPL. IBM says that SCO violated the GPL by denouncing the GPL's validity, and by claiming that the GPL violates the U.S. Constitution, together with copyright, antitrust and export control laws.  IBM also claims that SCO's SCOsource program is incompatible with the requirement that redistributions of GPLed works must be free of copyright licensing fees (fees may be charged for the acts of duplication and support). IBM has brought counterclaims alleging that SCO has violated the GPL and breached IBM's copyrights by collecting licensing fees while distributing IBM's copyrighted material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040331043539340|title=Groklaw - IBM's Second Amended Counterclaims Lists 9 Newly Registered Copyrights|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- WP:WEIGHT? SCO dropped their GPL-as-unconstitutional claims anyway.--&gt;

==Status of current lawsuits==

===''SCO v. IBM''===
{{Main article|SCO v. IBM}}
On March 7, 2003, SCO filed suit against IBM. Initially this lawsuit was about breach of contract and trade secrets. Later, SCO dropped the trade secrets claim, so the claim is breach of contract. SCO also added a copyright claim related to IBM's continued use of AIX, but not related to Linux. The judge subsequently stated that the SCO Group had indeed made a claim of copyright infringement against IBM regarding Linux. IBM filed multiple counter claims, including charges of both patent violations, which were later dropped, and violation of copyright law.

On February 8, 2005, Judge Kimball ruled that IBM's motions for summary judgment were premature but added:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Viewed against the backdrop of SCO's plethora of public statements concerning IBM's and others' infringement of SCO's purported copyrights to the UNIX software, it is astonishing that SCO has not offered any competent evidence to create a disputed fact regarding whether IBM has infringed SCO's alleged copyrights through IBM's Linux activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050209203941896|title=Groklaw - Kimball Memoradum and Order - as text|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On June 28, 2006 Judge Brooke Wells granted, in part, IBM's motion to limit SCO's claims and excluded 186 of SCO's 294 items of allegedly misused intellectual property (IBM had challenged 201 of them for various reasons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060628175203644|title=Groklaw - Wells Grants in Part IBM's Motion to Limit SCO's Claims!  In *Large* Part.|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells cited a number of factors including SCO's inability to provide sufficient specificity in these claims:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In December 2003, near the beginning of this case, the court ordered SCO to, "identify and state with specificity the source code(s) that SCO is claiming forms the basis of their action against IBM." Even if SCO lacked the code behind methods and concepts at this early stage, SCO could have and should have, at least articulated which methods and concepts formed "the basis of their action against IBM." At a minimum, SCO should have identified the code behind their method and concepts in the final submission pursuant to this original order entered in December 2003 and Judge Kimball’s order entered in July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060628203537917|title=Groklaw - Wells' Order Granting in Part IBM's Motion to Limit SCO's Claims, as text|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This left about 100 of SCO's items of allegedly misused intellectual property (the merits of which have not yet been judged), out of 294 items originally disclosed by SCO.

Following the partial summary judgment rulings in the SCO vs Novell Slander of Title case, Judge Kimball asked&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/IBM-1077.pdf |title=Data |website=www.groklaw.net |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; the parties in SCO v IBM to prepare by August 31, 2007, a statement of the status of this case.

===''Red Hat v. SCO''===
{{Main article|Red Hat v. SCO}}
Red Hat filed suit against SCO on August 4, 2003. Red Hat sued SCO for false advertising, deceptive trade practices and asked for a declaratory judgment of noninfringement of any of SCO's copyrights. This case has been stayed pending resolution of the IBM case.

===''SCO v. Novell''===
{{Main article|SCO v. Novell}}
After SCO initiated their Linux campaign, they said that they were the owners of [[Unix|UNIX]]. Novell claimed these statements were false, and that they still owned the rights in question. After Novell registered the copyrights to some key UNIX products, SCO filed suit against Novell on January 20, 2004.&lt;ref name="novell-0"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://groklaw.net/pdf/Novell-0.pdf | title=SCO's Complaint In the Third Judicial District Court of Salt Lake County, State of Utah | date=2004-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Novell [[removal jurisdiction|removed]] the suit to federal court on February 6, 2004.&lt;ref name="novell-1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://groklaw.net/pdf/Novell-1.pdf | title=Novell's Removal Notice | date=2004-02-06 | publisher=Groklaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 2005, Novell filed its answer with the court, denying SCO's claims. Novell also filed counterclaims asking the court to force SCO to turn over the revenues it had received from UNIX licenses, less a 5% administrative fee. Additionally, Novell asked the court to place the funds in a "constructive trust" in order to ensure that SCO could pay Novell since the company's assets were depleting rapidly.

On August 10, 2007, Judge Dale Kimball, hearing the SCO v. Novell case, ruled that "...the court concludes that Novell is the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare Copyrights". Novell was awarded summary judgments on a number of claims, and a number of SCO claims were denied. SCO was instructed to account for and pass to Novell an appropriate portion of income relating to SCOSource licences to Sun Microsystems and Microsoft. A number of matters are not disposed of by Judge Kimball's ruling, and the outcome of these are still pending.&lt;ref name="doc377" /&gt;&lt;ref name="novell379" /&gt;

On July 16, 2008, the trial court issued an order awarding Novell $2,547,817 and ruled that SCO was not authorized to enter into the 2003 agreement with Sun.&lt;ref name="July 2008"&gt;

On August 24, 2009, the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]] partially reversed the August 10, 2007 district court summary judgment ruling.  The appeals court [[Remand (court procedure)|remand]]ed back to trial on the issues of copyright ownership and Novell's contractual waiver rights.  The court upheld the $2,547,817 award granted to Novell for the 2003 Sun agreement.&lt;ref name="Novell August 2009"&gt;

===''SCO v. AutoZone''===
[[AutoZone]], a corporate user of Linux and former user of SCO OpenServer, was sued by SCO on March 3, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Primary court documents pertaining to this case can be found at [http://sco.tuxrocks.com/?Case=AutoZone http://sco.tuxrocks.com/?Case=AutoZone].&lt;/ref&gt; SCO claims AutoZone violated SCO's copyrights by using Linux. The suit was stayed pending the resolution of the IBM, Red Hat and Novell cases.

On September 26, 2008, Judge Robert C. Jones lifted the stay, effective December 31, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url=http://groklaw.net/article.php?story=20080926054747382  | title=Stay Lifted on AutoZone as of December 31st - Updated  | accessdate=2009-10-23  | date=2008-09-26  | publisher=Groklaw }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He initially scheduled discovery for April 9, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url=http://groklaw.net/article.php?story=20090121182736840  | title=Members Only -- Docket Update - BK and AutoZone  | accessdate=2009-10-23  | date=2009-01-21  | publisher=Groklaw }}&lt;/ref&gt;  SCO filed an amended complaint on August 14, 2009.

===''SCO v. DaimlerChrysler''===
{{Main article|SCO v. DaimlerChrysler}}
In December 2003, SCO demanded that some UNIX licensees certify certain issues regarding their use of Linux. [[DaimlerChrysler]], a former UNIX user and current Linux user, did not respond to this demand. On March 3, 2004 SCO filed suit against DaimlerChrysler for violating their UNIX license agreement by failing to respond to the certification request. Almost every claim SCO made has been ruled against in summary judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Not dismissed, see the [http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/DCHearing-2.pdf hearing transcript, page 15]&lt;/ref&gt; The last remaining issue, that of whether DaimlerChrysler made a timely response, was dismissed by agreement of SCO and DaimlerChrysler in December 2004. SCO retains the right to continue this case at a future date, providing it pays legal fees to DaimlerChrysler.

==Other issues and conflicts==

===SCO announces that it will not sue its own customers===
On June 23, 2003, SCO sent out a letter announcing that it would not be suing its own Linux customers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caldera.com/scosource/letter_to_partners.html The SCO Group, Inc. | Scosource | Letter_to_partners&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041009172817/http://www.caldera.com/scosource/letter_to_partners.html |date=October 9, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the letter, it states:

{{quote|SCO will continue to support our SCO Linux and OpenLinux customers and partners who have previously implemented those products and we will hold them harmless from any SCO intellectual property issues regarding Linux.}}

===SCO and SGI===
In August 2003, SCO presented two examples of what they claimed was illegal copying of copyrighted code from UNIX to Linux. One of the examples ([[Berkeley Packet Filter]]) was not related to original UNIX code at all. The other example did, however, seem to originate from the UNIX code and was apparently contributed by a UNIX vendor, [[Silicon Graphics]]. However, an analysis by the Linux community later revealed that:

* The code originated from an even older version of UNIX which at some point was published by Caldera{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;!-- Please be specific about the date and which of the various Caldera companies is meant here. --&gt;, thus making any claim of copyright infringement shaky.
* The code did not do anything. It was in a part of the Linux kernel that was written in anticipation of a Silicon Graphics architecture that was never released.
* It had already been removed from the kernel two months earlier.
* The contested segment was small (80 lines) and trivial.

===SCO and BayStar Capital===
In October 2003, [[BayStar Capital]] and [[Royal Bank of Canada]] invested US$50 million in The SCO Group to support the legal cost of SCO's Linux campaign. Later it was shown that BayStar was referred to SCO by Microsoft, whose proprietary [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system competes with Linux. In 2003, BayStar looked at SCO on the recommendation of Microsoft, according to Lawrence R. Goldfarb, managing partner of BayStar Capital: "It was evident that Microsoft had an agenda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE1DB173AF931A15757C0A9629C8B63&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=TECHNOLOGY; Investor's Pullout Stirs Doubts About SCO Group | first=Steve | last=Lohr | date=April 22, 2004 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 2004, ''The New York Times'' reported that BayStar Capital, a private [[hedge fund]] which had arranged for $50M in funding for SCO in October 2003, was asking for its $20M back. The remainder of the $50M was from Royal Bank of Canada. SCO stated in their press release that they believed that BayStar did not have grounds for making this demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/22/business/technology-investor-s-pullout-stirs-doubts-about-sco-group.html?scp=5&amp;sq=baystar+capital&amp;st=cse|title=TECHNOLOGY; Investor's Pullout Stirs Doubts About SCO Group|first=Steve|last=Lohr|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, 2004, SCO and BayStar resolved their dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/08/27/sco_completes_baystar_settlement/|title=SCO closes BayStar deal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SCO and Canopy Group===
The [[Canopy Group]] is an investment group with shares in a trust of different companies. It is a group owned by the [[Raymond Noorda|Noorda]] family, also founders of Novell.

Until February 2005, Canopy held SCO shares, and the management of SCO held shares of Canopy. The two parties became embroiled in a bitter dispute when the Noorda family sought to oust board member [[Ralph Yarro III]] on claims of [[misappropriation]]. With internal problems not made public (which included the suicides of Canopy's director of [[information systems]], [[Robert Penrose]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051228235018/http://blog.mecworks.com/articles/2004/12/26/rob-penrose/] Rob Penrose&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Val Kriedel]], the daughter of [[Ray Noorda]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/536/000108212/] Noorda bio&lt;/ref&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/125977/|title=Daily Herald - Canopy founder's daughter found dead&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,600111043,00.html] Canopy at Heart of Feud&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smallworks.com/archives/00000250.htm] Sex, Drugs, and Unix {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314051749/http://www.smallworks.com/archives/00000250.htm |date=March 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Canopy Group agreed to buy back all the shares that SCO had in Canopy in exchange for their SCO shares and cash.

SCO and Canopy Group are now mostly independent, though SCO continues to rent their Utah office space from Canopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20071219004012610|title=SCO Asks Bankruptcy Court to Approve New Leases in NJ and Utah|last=Jones|first=Pamela|publisher=Groklaw|date=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microsoft funding of SCO controversy===
On March 4, 2004, a leaked SCO internal e-mail detailed how Microsoft had raised up to $106 million via the BayStar referral and other means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/halloween/halloween10.html|title=Halloween Document 10|website=www.catb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blake Stowell of SCO confirmed the memo was real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1542915,00.asp|title=HP TouchPad Needs 6 to 8 Weeks for Additional Shipments|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; BayStar claimed the deal was suggested by Microsoft, but that no money for it came directly from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2004/tc20040311_8915_tc119.htm|title=BW Online - March 11, 2004 - SCO's Suit: A Match Made in Redmond?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to the Baystar involvement, Microsoft paid SCO $6M (USD) in May 2003 for a license to "Unix and Unix-related patents", despite the lack of Unix-related patents owned by SCO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/08/08/31OPcringely_1.html SCO strikes gold, Verizon just strikes | InfoWorld | Column | 2003-08-08 | By Robert X.

This deal was widely seen in the press as a boost to SCO's finances which would help SCO with its lawsuit against IBM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1016-1007528.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120711233345/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1016-1007528.html|deadurl=yes|title=Microsoft to license Unix code - CNET News|date=11 July 2012|archivedate=11 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ir.sco.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?releaseid=109360 The SCO Group | Investor Relations | SCO Announces UNIX Licensing Deal With Microsoft&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825130902/http://ir.sco.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?releaseid=109360 |date=2006-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SCOsource===
After their initial claim of copyright infringement in the Linux kernel, The SCO Group started their SCOsource initiative, which sells licenses of SCO's claimed copyrighted software, other than OpenServer and Unixware licenses. After a small number of high-profile sales (including one that was denied by the claimed purchaser), SCO claimed to offer corporate users of Linux a license at US$699 per processor running Linux. However, many individuals{{Who|date=December 2015}} have found it impossible to buy such a license from SCO. SCO says that participants of the SCOsource initiative are not liable for any claims that SCO makes against Linux users.

===The Michael Davidson E-Mail===
On July 14, 2005, an email&lt;ref name=md&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/IBM-459-22.pdf |title=Data |website=www.groklaw.net |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; was unsealed that had been sent from Michael Davidson to Reg Broughton (both Caldera International employees) in 2002, before many of the lawsuits. In it, Davidson reported how the company had hired an outside consultant because ''(spelling as in the original)'':
{{cquote|of SCO's executive management refusing to believe that it was possible for Linux and much of the GNU software to have come into existence without *someone* *somewhere* having copied pieces of proprietary UNIX source code to which SCO owned the copyright. The hope was that we would find a "smoking gun" somewhere in code that was being used by Red Hat and/or the other Linux companies that would give us some leverage. (There was, at one stage, the idea that we would sell licences to corporate customers who were using Linux as a kind of "insurance policy" in case it turned out that they were using code which infringed on our copyright).}}

The consultant was to review the Linux code and compare it to Unix source code, to find possible copyright infringement. Davidson himself said that he had not expected to find anything significant based on his own knowledge of the code and had voiced his opinion that it was "a waste of time". After 4 to 6 months of consultant's work, Davidson says: ''"...we had found absolutely *nothing*. ie no evidence of any copyright infringement whatsoever."&lt;ref name=md/&gt;

Affixed atop an existing column, the statue was mounted by three anonymous artists and their helpers, who were dressed in white construction helmets and reflective vests in imitation of Parks Department workers,&lt;ref name=nydn/&gt; early in the morning of April 6, then covered and taken down by [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation|NYC Parks]] officials later that day.&lt;ref name=GuardApr15&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/06/edward-snowden-statue-bust-brooklyn-park-covered |first1=Alan |last1=Yuhas |title=Busted: Edward Snowden statue prompts cover-up at Brooklyn park |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=April 6, 2015 |accessdate=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/snowden-statue-in-new-york/article7076381.ece |title=Edward Snowden statue surfaces in NYC park |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=7 April 2015 |location=New York |accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[hologram]] tribute to Snowden was subsequently installed after the statue was removed.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;

==Development and design==
The piece was conceived in 2014 by two artists from New York City and a sculptor from the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. The sculptor volunteered his time and skill in creating the statue, with the piece eventually costing thousands of dollars to create over six months.&lt;ref name=ANYApr15/&gt;{{efn-ua|"It's easily a 30 grand project... If it were bronze, it could be a $100,000 piece of artwork, maybe more."&lt;ref name=ANYApr15/&gt;}} The artwork consisted of a {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=on}} high, {{Convert|100|lb|kg|adj = on}} bust of Snowden on top of a [[Doric column]], with a [[Plexiglas]] stand with Snowden's name on it.&lt;ref name="GuardApr15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yahoo"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/photos/bust-of-edward-snowden-1428413495-slideshow/photo-provided-aymann-ismail-animalnewyork-monday-april-6-photo-001303800.html |title=Bust of Edward Snowden |publisher=[[Yahoo news]] |date=April 6, 2015 |accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece was fused to [[Fort Greene Park]]'s [[Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument]]&lt;ref name=GuardApr15/&gt; in the pre-dawn hours of April 6, 2015.&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt; The sculptor recommended that the two artists create a bust after they had suggested a life-size statue of Snowden. The bust was made from [[Plaster#In art|Hydrocal]], a plaster-like substance resembling bronze in appearance, which was then fixed to the pre-existing column with a non-damaging adhesive.&lt;ref name=ANYApr15/&gt; The piece was designed to be similar in style to other sculptures in the park.{{efn-ua|Both design and color "expertly match[ed]" the existing motif and sculptures "from its bronze patina finish to Snowden's hair—which mimics the texture of the feather on the eagle."  The lettering for Snowden's name was "befitting of a monument."&lt;ref name=ANYApr15/&gt;}}

While it was very important to the artists that the piece be more than just a prop or [[papier-mache]] [[effigy]], they also wished not to damage the surface to which the bust would be bound. After some debate, they decided on an adhesive that would firmly hold the head in place, yet could be removed without marring the monument.&lt;ref name=ANYApr15/&gt; The statue had Snowden's name at its base, consistent with the names on the bases of other sculptures in the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Edward-Snowden-Statue-Bust-New-York-NY-Brooklyn-War-Monument-298782461.html |title=Giant Edward Snowden Sculpture Appears on War Monument in Brooklyn Park |publisher=[[NBC News]] |date=April 6, 2015 |accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Guardian'' newspaper expressed the view that the statue also looked like the former White House press secretary [[Jay Carney]] and some people thought it looked more like him than it did Snowden.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |title=Busted: Edward Snowden statue prompts cover-up at Brooklyn park |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/06/edward-snowden-statue-bust-brooklyn-park-covered |accessdate=11 April 2015 |work=Guardian |date=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newtekjournalismuk&gt;{{cite news |title=Edward Snowden illicit bust removed |url=http://www.newtekjournalismukworld.com/eileen-kersey/edward-snowden-illicit-bust-removed |accessdate=11 April 2015 |work=New TEKJournalismUK |date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument 2.0'' is one of at least six sculptures and monuments to Snowden that have appeared around the world.{{efn-ua|Another such sculpture is the hologram that replaced this statue after its removal (see [[#Aftermath|"Aftermath" section]]).&lt;ref name="untapped cities"/&gt;}}  In October 2014, a statue of Snowden appeared in [[Union Square, Manhattan]], near [[Henry Kirke Brown]]'s [[Abraham Lincoln]] statue.&lt;ref name="untapped cities"/&gt; It was shown in conjunction with the [[Art in Odd Places]] festival and was sculpted by [[Jim Dessicino]], a [[Delaware]] artist.  One of the statue's observers compared Snowden to [[Daniel Ellsberg]], who leaked the ''[[Pentagon Papers]]'' to the ''[[New York Times]]''.{{efn-ua|Although the statue went unrecognized by most passersby, one opined: "He's our generation's Daniel Ellsberg ...

Hours after the statue was removed, a group of New York artists calling themselves [[The Illuminator Art Collective]]—unrelated to the three artists who created the statue—used smoke and projection equipment to create an ephemeral "[[hologram]]" image of Snowden in place of the missing sculpture.

==Return of sculpture==

After negotiations with the artists' attorney, the city returned the sculpture on May 6, 2015, assessing each artist a $50 fine for non-criminal trespassing due to their having illegally entered Fort Greene Park at night.

[[File:PikiWiki Israel 31909 The Giving Tree garden in Holon.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|The Giving Tree Garden in Holon, Israel]]

'''''The Giving Tree''''' is a children's [[picture book]] written and illustrated by [[Shel Silverstein]]. First published in 1964 by [[Harper &amp; Row]], it has become one of Silverstein's best known titles and has been translated into numerous languages.

This book has been described as "one of the most divisive books in children's literature." The controversy concerns whether the relationship between the main characters (a boy and a tree) should be interpreted as positive (i.e., the tree gives the boy [[Altruism|selfless love]]) or as negative (i.e., the boy and the tree have an abusive relationship).

==Background==

Silverstein had difficulty finding a publisher for ''The Giving Tree''.&lt;ref name=NYT1973&gt;{{cite news |title=About Alice, a Rabbit, a Tree... |author= Cole, William |newspaper=The New York Times |page=394|date=September 9, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2011&gt;{{cite news |title=The Children’s Authors Who Broke the Rules |author= Paul, Pamela|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/books/review/the-childrens-authors-who-broke-the-rules.html|newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 16, 2011 |accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editor at [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] rejected the book's manuscript because he felt that it was "too sad" for children and "too simple" for adults.&lt;ref name=NYT1973/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2011/&gt; [[Tomi Ungerer]] encouraged Silverstein to approach [[Ursula Nordstrom]], who was a publisher with Harper &amp; Row.&lt;ref name=NYT1973/&gt;

An editor with Harper &amp; Row stated that Silverstein had made the original illustrations "scratchy" like his cartoons for ''[[Playboy]]'', but that he later reworked the art in a "more pared-down and much sweeter style."&lt;ref name=HornBook1999/&gt; The final black-and-white drawings have been described as "unadorned… visual minimalism."&lt;ref name=Spitz1999&gt;{{cite book | last = Spitz | first = Ellen Handler | title = Inside Picture Books | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven, CT | year = 1999 | isbn = 0300076029 | pages=142–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harper &amp; Row published a small first edition of the book, consisting of only 5,000–7,500 copies, in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Natov, Roni |author2=Geraldine DeLuca  |lastauthoramp=yes |year= 1979 |title= Discovering Contemporary Classics: an Interview with Ursula Nordstrom|journal= [[The Lion and the Unicorn (journal)|The Lion and the Unicorn]] |volume= 3 |issue= 1 |pages =119–135 |url= http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/uni/summary/v003/3.1.natov01.html|access-date=May 18, 2013|doi= 10.1353/uni.0.0355 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The book follows the lives of a female apple tree and a boy, who develop a relationship with one another.  The tree is very "giving" and the boy evolves into a "taking" teenager, man, then elderly man.  Despite the fact that the boy ages in the story, the tree addresses the boy as "Boy" his entire life.  

In his childhood, the boy enjoys playing with the tree, climbing her trunk, swinging from her branches, carving "Me + T (Tree)" into the bark, and eating her apples. However, as the boy grows older, he spends less time with the tree and tends to visit her only when he wants material items at various stages of his life, or not coming to the tree alone (such as bringing a lady friend to the tree and carving "Me +Y.L." (her initials) into the tree. In an effort to make the boy happy at each of these stages, the tree gives him parts of herself, which he can transform into material items, such as money (from her apples), a house (from her branches), and a boat (from her trunk).  With every stage of giving, "the Tree was happy". 

In the final pages, both the tree and the boy feel the sting of their respective "giving" and "taking" nature.  When only a stump remains for the tree (including the carving "Me + T"), she is not happy, at least at that moment.  The boy does return as a tired elderly man to meet the tree once more. She tells him she is sad because she cannot provide him shade, apples, or any materials like in the past. He ignores this and states that all he wants is "a quiet place to sit and rest," which the tree, who is weak being just a stump, could provide.  With this final stage of giving, "the Tree was happy".

==Reception==

Interest in the book increased by [[word of mouth]]; for example, in churches "it was hailed as a parable on the joys of giving."&lt;ref name=NYT1973/&gt;  As of 2001, over 5 million copies of the book had been sold, placing it 14th on a list of hardcover "All-Time Bestselling Children's Books" from ''[[Publishers Weekly]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Roback, Diane, Jason Britton, and Debbie Hochman Turvey |date= December 17, 2001 |title= All-Time Bestselling Children's Books |journal= Publishers Weekly |volume= 248 |issue= 51 |url= http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20011217/28595-all-time-bestselling-children-s-books.html|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2011, 8.5 million copies of the book had been sold.&lt;ref name=NYT2011/&gt;

== Interpretations ==
{{weasel words|section|date=April 2015}}
The book has generated various opinions on how to interpret the relationship between the tree and the boy.  Some possible interpretations include:&lt;ref name=Samuelsson1998&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pramling Samuelsson|first1=Ingrid |last2=Mauritzson|first2=Ulla|last3=Asplund Carlsson|first3=Maj|last4=Ueda|first4=Miyoko|title=A Mother and a Friend: Differences in Japanese and Swedish Mothers' Understanding of a Tale|journal=Childhood|volume=5|issue=4|year=1998|pages=493–506|issn=0907-5682|doi=10.1177/0907568298005004008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fraustino2008&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fraustino |first1=Lisa Rowe |chapter=At the Core of The Giving Tree’s Signifying Apples |pages=284–306  | editor1-first=Annette M.  |editor1-last=Magid | title = You Are What You Eat: Literary Probes into the Palate | publisher = Cambridge Scholars | location = Newcastle, UK | year = 2008 | isbn = 9781847184924 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious interpretation===
Ursula Nordstrom attributed the book's success partially to "Protestant ministers and Sunday-school teachers", who believed that the tree represents "the Christian ideal of unconditional love."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/books/review/15MARCUSL.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title='Runny Babbit': Hoppity Hip |first=Leonard S. |last=Marcus|date=May 15, 2005|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental interpretation===
Some people believe that the tree represents [[Mother Nature]] and the boy represents humanity. The book has been used to teach children [[environmental ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Examined Life, Age 8 |author= Goodnough, Abby |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/education/edlife/18philosophy-t.html  |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 16, 2010|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An educational resource for children describes the book as an "allegory about the responsibilities a human being has for living organisms in the environment,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fredericks | first = Anthony D. | title = The Librarian's Complete Guide to Involving Parents Through Children's Literature Grades K-6 | publisher = Libraries Unlimited | location = Englewood, CO | year = 1997 | isbn = 1563085380 |chapter= 26. The Giving Tree | page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa Rowe Fraustino states that “some curricula use the book as a what-not-to-do role model."&lt;ref name=Fraustino2008/&gt; 

===Friendship interpretation===
One writer believes that the relationship between the boy and the tree is one of friendship.  As such, the book teaches children "as your life becomes polluted with the trappings of the modern world — as you 'grow up' — your relationships tend to suffer if you let them fall to the wayside."&lt;ref name=Belkin2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/childrens-books-you-might-hate/|publisher=New York Times|title=Children’s Books You (Might) Hate|author=Belkin, Lisa|work="Motherlode: Adventures in Parenting" blog|date=September 8, 2010|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another writer's criticism of this interpretation is that the tree appears to be an adult when the boy is young, and cross-generational friendships are rare.&lt;ref name=Belkin2010/&gt;

===Parent–child interpretations===
A common interpretation of the book is that the tree and the boy have a parent–child relationship, as in a 1995 collection of essays about the book edited by [[Richard John Neuhaus]] in the journal ''[[First Things]]''.&lt;ref name=FirstThings&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2008/08/002-the-giving-tree-a-symposium-43|author=May, William F., Amy A. Kass, Marc Gellman, Midge Decter, Gilbert Meilaender, Mary Ann Glendon, William Werpehowski, Timothy Fuller, Leon R. Kass, Timothy P. Jackson, Jean Bethke Elshtain, Richard John Neuhaus|title=The Giving Tree: A Symposium|date=January 1995|publisher=The Institute on Religion and Public Life|journal=[[First Things]]|accessdate=May 18, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512035637/http://www.firstthings.com/article/2008/08/002-the-giving-tree-a-symposium-43|archivedate=May 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the essayists, some were positive about the relationship; for example, [[Amy A. Kass]] wrote about the story that "it is wise and it is true about giving and about motherhood," and her husband [[Leon Kass|Leon R. Kass]] encourages people to read the book because the tree "is an emblem of the sacred memory of our own mother's love."&lt;ref name=FirstThings/&gt; Other essayists put forth negative views. [[Mary Ann Glendon]] wrote that the book is "a nursery tale for the 'me' generation, a primer of narcissism, a catechism of exploitation," and [[Jean Bethke Elshtain]] felt that the story ends with the tree and the boy "both wrecks."&lt;ref name=FirstThings/&gt;

A 1998 study using [[Phenomenography|phenomenographic]] methods found that Swedish children and mothers tended to interpret the book as dealing with friendship, while Japanese mothers tended to interpret the book as dealing with parent–child relationships.&lt;ref name=Samuelsson1998/&gt;

===Interpretation as satire===
Some authors believe that the book is not actually intended for children, but instead should be treated as a [[satire]] aimed at adults along the lines of ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]].&lt;ref name=JacksonDell&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jackson, Jacqueline |author2=Carol Dell  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1979 |title= The Other Giving Tree|journal=Language Arts |volume=56 |issue= 4|pages= 427–429|jstor=41404822 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StrandburgLivo1986&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Strandburg, Walter L. |author2=Norma J. Livo |lastauthoramp=yes |title=''The Giving Tree'' or There is a Sucker Born Every Minute|journal=Children's Literature in Education|volume=17|issue=1|year=1986|pages=17–24|doi=10.1007/BF01126946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and controversy ==

Elizabeth Bird, writing for the ''School Library Journal'', described ''The Giving Tree'' as "one of the most divisive books in children's literature".&lt;ref name=SLJ2012&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.slj.com/afuse8production/2012/05/18/top-100-picture-books-85-the-giving-tree-by-shel-silverstein/|title= Top 100 Picture Books #85: The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein|author= Bird, Elizabeth | publisher=''[[School Library Journal]]'' "A Fuse #8 Production" blog|date= May 18, 2012|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism revolves about the depiction of the relationship between the boy and the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Spitz, Ellen Handler|date=May–June 1999 |title= Classic children's book|journal=American Heritage |volume=50 |issue= 3|pages= 46|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/classic-children%E2%80%99s-book|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote |Totally self-effacing, the 'mother' treats her 'son' as if he were a perpetual infant, while he behaves toward her as if he were frozen in time as an importunate baby. This overrated picture book thus presents as a paradigm for young children a callously exploitative human relationship — both across genders and across generations. It perpetuates the myth of the selfless, all-giving mother who exists only to be used and the image of a male child who can offer no reciprocity, express no gratitude, feel no empathy — an insatiable creature who encounters no limits for his demands.}}

Critics of the book say that the boy never thanks the tree for its gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Lesson from 'The Giving Tree'  |author= Prosapio, Winter |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0512/p18s03-hfes.html |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=May 12, 2006  |accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''Horn Book Magazine'', Phyllis J. Fogelman, an editor with Harper &amp; Row, said the book is "about a sadomasochistic relationship" and "elevates masochism to the level of a good",&lt;ref name=HornBook1999&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marcus, Leonard S. |date=March–April 1999 |title=An Interview with Phyllis J.

One college instructor discovered that the book caused both male and female [[Remedial education|remedial reading]] students to be angry because they felt that the boy exploited the tree.&lt;ref name=Juchartz2004&gt;{{cite journal |author= Juchartz, Larry R|date=December 2003 – January 2004 |title= Team Teaching with Dr. Seuss and Shel Silverstein in the College Basic Reading Classroom|journal= Journal of Adolescent &amp; Adult Literacy |volume= 47|issue=4 |pages=336–341}}&lt;/ref&gt; For teaching purposes, he paired the book with a short story by [[Andre Dubus]] entitled "The Fat Girl" because its plot can be described as ''The Giving Tree'' "in reverse."&lt;ref name=Juchartz2004/&gt;

=== Author's photograph ===
[[File:Shel Silverstein photograph on back cover of The Giving Tree.jpeg|thumb|Photograph of Silverstein that is used on the back cover of the book.]]

==Cultural influences and adaptations==

===Other versions===

A short animated film of the book, produced in 1973, featured Silverstein's narration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= Bosustow, Nick, and Shel Silverstein (Producers); Hayward, Charlie O.  (Director and Animator); Silverstein, Shel (Original Story, Music, and Narration) |year= 1973|title=The Giving Tree |medium=VHS |publisher= SVE &amp; Churchill Media|location=Chicago, IL |oclc= 48713769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TZCP6OqRlE |title= The Giving Tree: Based on the Book and Drawings by Shel Silverstein|year=1973 |publisher=Churchill Films|website=YouTube |accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Silverstein also wrote a song of the same name, which was performed by [[Bobby Bare]] and his family on his album ''Singin' in the Kitchen'' (1974).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= Bobby Bare and the Family (Musicians); Silverstein, Shel (Principal Composer) |year= 1973|title=Singin' in the Kitchen|medium=LP |publisher=RCA Victor|location=New York|oclc= 6346534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silverstein created an adult version of the story in a cartoon entitled "I Accept the Challenge."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the cartoon, a nude woman cuts off a nude man's arms and legs with scissors, then sits on his torso in a pose similar to the final drawing in ''The Giving Tree'' in which the old man sits on the stump.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Jackson and Dell (1979) wrote an "alternative version" of the story for teaching purposes that was entitled "The Other Giving Tree."&lt;ref name=JacksonDell/&gt; It featured two trees next to each other and a boy growing up.  One tree acted like the one in ''The Giving Tree'', ending up as a stump, while the other tree stopped at giving the boy apples, and does not give the boy its branches or trunk. At the end of the story, the stump was sad that the old man chose to sit under the shade of the other tree.&lt;ref name=JacksonDell/&gt;

===Cultural influences===

[[The Giving Tree Band]] took its name from the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Giving Tree Band Takes Story to Heart |author= Markstrom, Serena |url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Giving+Tree+Band+takes+story+to+heart.-a0230805426|newspaper=[[The Register-Guard]] |date=June 18, 2010|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plain White T's EP ''[[Should've Gone to Bed]]'' has a song The Giving Tree, written by [[Tim Lopez]].

[[Image:Rome-VillaBorghese-TempleEsculape.jpg|thumb|The 18th century "[[Temple of Aesculapius (Villa Borghese)|Temple of Aesculapius]]" built purely as a landscape feature, influenced by the lake at [[Stourhead]], [[Wiltshire]], [[England]].]]

'''Villa Borghese''' is a landscape [[garden]] in the naturalistic [[English landscape garden|English manner]] in [[Rome]], containing a number of buildings, museums (see [[Galleria Borghese]]) and attractions. It is the third largest public park in Rome (80 hectares or 197.7 acres) after the ones of the [[Villa Doria Pamphili]] and [[Villa Ada]]. The gardens were developed for the [[Galleria Borghese|Villa Borghese Pinciana]] ("Borghese villa on the [[Pincian Hill]]"), built by the architect Flaminio Ponzio, developing sketches by [[Scipione Borghese]], who used it as a ''villa suburbana'', a party villa, at the edge of Rome, and to house his art collection.  The gardens as they are now were remade in the early nineteenth century.

==History==
In 1605, Cardinal [[Scipione Borghese]], nephew of [[Pope Paul V]] and patron of [[Bernini]], began turning this former vineyard into the most extensive gardens built in Rome since Antiquity. The vineyard's site is identified with the [[gardens of Lucullus]], the most famous in the late Roman republic. In the 19th century much of the garden's former formality was remade as a landscape garden in the English taste (''illustration, right''). The Villa Borghese gardens were long informally open, but were bought by the commune of Rome and given to the public in 1903. The large landscape park in the English taste contains several villas. The [[Spanish Steps]] lead up to this park, and there is another entrance at the Porte del Popolo by [[Piazza del Popolo]]. The ''Pincio'' (the [[Pincian Hill]] of ancient Rome), in the south part of the park, offers one of the greatest views over Rome.

The Piazza di Siena, located in the villa, hosted the [[Equestrian at the 1960 Summer Olympics|equestrian]] [[dressage]], individual [[jumping]], and the jumping part of the [[eventing]] competition for the [[1960 Summer Olympics]]. A balustrade (dating from the early seventeenth century) from the gardens, was taken to England in the late 19th century, and installed in the grounds of [[Cliveden]] House, a mansion in [[Buckinghamshire]], in 1896.  In 2004, a species of [[Papillifera papillaris|Italian snail]] was discovered, still living on the balustrade after more than 100 years in England.

==Villas in the gardens==
*Today the [[Galleria Borghese]] is housed in the Villa Borghese itself.  The garden '''Casino Borghese,''' built on a rise above the Villa by the architect [[Giovanni Vasanzio]], was set up by [[Pope Paul V|Camillo Borghese]] to contain sculptures by [[Bernini]] from the [[Borghese collection]], including his ''David'' and his ''Daphne'', and paintings by [[Titian]], [[Raphael]] and [[Caravaggio]].
*The [[Villa Giulia]] adjoining the Villa Borghese gardens was built in 1551 - 1555 as a summer residence for [[Pope Julius III]]; now it contains the Etruscan Museum (''Museo Etrusco'').

[[Image:Vista del jardín de la Villa Medici en Roma, por Diego Velázquez.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Painting by [[Diego Velázquez]]]]
*The [[Villa Medici]] houses the [[French Academy in Rome]], and the ''Fortezzuola'' a Gothic garden structure that houses a collection memorializing the academic modern sculptor [[Pietro Canonica]]. In the 1650s, [[Diego Velázquez]] painted several depictions of this Villa's garden casino festively illuminated at night. Before electricity, such torchlit illuminations carried an excitement hard to conceive today.
*Other villas scattered through the Villa Borghese gardens are remains of a [[International Exhibition of Art (1911)|world exposition]] in Rome in 1911.
**The ''[[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna]]'' located in its grounds has a collection of 19th- and 20th-century paintings emphasizing Italian artists. 
**Architecturally the most notable of the 1911 exposition pavilions is the English pavilion designed by Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]] (who later designed [[New Delhi]]), now housing the [[British School at Rome]].

==Other points of interest==
*The villa's gardens feature in one of [[Ottorino Respighi|Respighi]]'s ''[[Pini di Roma]]''.
*The garden contains a replica of the Shakespeare's [[Globe Theatre]] built in 2003. 
*Beside the 1911 Exposition's villas, there is the Exposition's Zoo, recently redesigned, with minimal caging, as the [[Bioparco]], and the [[Museo Civico di Zoologia|Zoological Museum]] (''Museo di Zoologia'').
*In 1873 a [[hydrochronometer]] on the 1867 design of Gian Battista Embriaco, O.P.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casanatense.it/index.php/it/gli-editoriali/72-stampe-e-disegni/153-orologi.html?showall%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216190518/http://www.casanatense.it/index.php/it/gli-editoriali/72-stampe-e-disegni/153-orologi.html?showall=1 |archivedate=December 16, 2013 }}  Accessed 20 March 2013: "È infatti del 1867 l'invenzione dell'idrocronometro, dovuta al padre domenicano Giovanni Battista Embriaco, che attese ai suoi studi di meccanica applicata all'orologeria nella solitudine del convento della Minerva."&lt;/ref&gt; inventor and professor of the Roman [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|College of St. Thomas]] was built in the gardens in emulation of the one at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|College of St. Thomas]].

'''''Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way''''' (also known as '''''Westward Ho''''') is a {{convert|20|x|30|ft|m|adj=on}} painted [[mural]] displayed behind the western staircase of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] chamber in the [[United States Capitol|United States Capitol Building]]. The mural was painted by [[Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze]] in 1861 and symbolizes [[Manifest Destiny]], the belief that the United States was destined for Western exploration and expansion originating from the initial colonies along the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic seaboard]] to the [[Pacific ocean|Pacific Ocean]]. A study measuring {{convert|33+1/4|x|43+3/8|in|cm|1}} hangs in the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;

The darkness turning into light represents the greatness that was believed to lie in the future West.

== Content ==
Leutze combined pioneer men and women, mountain guides, wagons, and mules to suggest a divinely ordained pilgrimage to the Promised Land of the western frontier. Within the left half of the picture is a depiction of the entrance to the San Francisco Bay, the [[Golden Gate]], which is being pointed to by the pilgrim seated atop the rock in the foreground. Within the right hemisphere of the painting is a depiction of a valley, representing the Valley of Darkness and symbolic of the troubles faced by explorers. The imagery is familiar imperial iconography and is regarded as a symbol of [[American exceptionalism]] and the realization of [[Manifest Destiny]], ultimately leading to the evolution of the American Empire.

== Literary reference ==

The painting takes its inspiration from the closing lines of [[George Berkeley]]'s ''Verses on the Prospect of Planting Arts and Learning in America:

&lt;poem&gt;
Westward the course of empire takes its way; 
The first four Acts already past, 
A fifth shall close the Drama with the day; 
Time's noblest offspring is the last.
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Influences ==
The imagery of the pilgrim gesturing on a high rock is very similar to the 5 cent [[postage stamp]], ''[[John C. Frémont|Fremont]] in the [[Rocky Mountains]]'' that was part of the 1898 [[Trans-Mississippi Issue]], and reprinted a century later.

A [[Currier and Ives]] print from 1868 uses the same title and theme for a very different print, showing a [[railroad]] crossing a new settlement as the train goes west.

A [[:File:'Westward The Course of Empire Takes Its Way' Laying Track 600 Miles West of St. Louis, Missouri, October 19, 1867.jpg|photographic print]] and a [https://www.kshs.org/km/items/view/153 stereograph] by [[Alexander Gardner (photographer)|Alexander Gardner]], both of an 1867 end-of-track frontier construction train, were titled "Westward The Course of Empire Takes Its Way".

== In popular culture ==

[[David Foster Wallace]] named one of his short stories "Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way" in his 1989 collection ''[[Girl with Curious Hair]]''.

Early revisions of the 1995 computer game ''[[Oregon Trail II]]'' depict the study version of this painting on the title screen.

The '''Zamorano Eighty''' is a list of books intended to represent the most significant early volumes published on the [[History of California|history]] of [[California]].  It was compiled in 1945 by members of the Zamorano Club, a [[Los Angeles]]-based group of [[bibliophile]]s.  Collecting [[first edition]]s of every volume on the list has become the goal of a number of book collectors, though to date only four people have completed the task.&lt;ref name="volkmann"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Dan-Volkmann-collector-of-rare-books-dies-3162597.php | title=Dan Volkmann, collector of rare books, dies | publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]] | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=May 7, 2009 | accessdate=May 30, 2013 | author=Tucker, Jill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zamorano Club was founded in 1928 and named for [[Agustín Vicente Zamorano]], the first [[Printer (publisher)|printer]] in California.&lt;ref name="zhistory"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zamoranoclubla.org/history/ | title=History of the Zamorano Club | publisher=The Zamorano Club | accessdate=June 3, 2013 | author=Nunis, Doyce B., Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Madness"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Z-KL2voBoUC | title=A Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books | publisher=Henry Holt and Company | author=Basbanes, Nicholas A. | authorlink=Nicholas A.

During this process, Cowan died, and his ''Bibliography of the History of California and the Pacific West'' was added to the list as a tribute.&lt;ref name="z80"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zamoranoclubla.org/zam80/ | title=The Zamorano 80 | publisher=The Zamorano Club | accessdate=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list contains significant works by a number of well-known authors like [[Mark Twain]], [[John Muir]], [[Bret Harte]], and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], as well as obscure texts concerning geographical exploration and legal matters.  Some of the works exist in very few, highly sought after copies, while others were quite common and not particularly valuable, until interest in the list caused their prices to rise.&lt;ref name="Water2010"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pIuC3A4_v_UC | title=The Zamorano 80 Revisited: A Collector's Update of a Classic Work | publisher=Xlibris Corporation | date=April 16, 2010 | accessdate=May 30, 2013 | author=Gordon J. Water | page=xi | isbn=978-1-4628-1868-6}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Book dealers often refer to items for sale using their "Zamorano number" or have special sections dedicated to items on the list.

Thomas Streeter was the first collector to assemble a complete collection of first editions of every item on the list.  His collection was auctioned between 1966 and 1969.&lt;ref name="z80"/&gt;  Businessman Frederick William Beinecke was the second.  Retired investment counselor Henry H. Clifford completed his collection in 1988 and his collection was auctioned in 1995.  The fourth was architect Daniel Volkmann, who completed his collection in 1994, and it was auctioned in 2003.&lt;ref name=volkmann /&gt;&lt;ref name="z80"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clifford /&gt;  Many other collectors have pursued this goal, including notorious [[bibliomane]] and book thief [[Stephen Blumberg]].&lt;ref name=Madness /&gt;

Only one institution, the [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library]] at [[Yale University]], possesses a complete collection of the Zamorano 80, donated by Frederick W. Beinecke.  Both the [[Bancroft Library]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and the [[Huntington Library]] in [[San Marino, California]] possess all but one of the volumes.&lt;ref name="Sloan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dsloan.com/Auctions/A12/DSIntro.htm | title=The Zamorano 80 | publisher=Dorothy Sloan Books | accessdate=May 30, 2013 | author=Sloan, Dorothy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rarest book on the list is number 64, the [[dime novel]] ''[[The Life and Adventures of Joaquín Murieta]]'' by [[John Rollin Ridge]] writing as "Yellow Bird".  Only two first-edition copies are known to exist, each used twice to complete the list.&lt;ref name=sloanJM /&gt;  It may be on the list only because Wagner owned a copy, which he sold to Streeter.  When Streeter's collection was being periodically auctioned, the auction of this copy was moved up over a year so the elderly Beinecke would be able to complete his Zamorano collection.  This copy is now in the Beinecke Library with the rest of Beinecke's Zamorano books.&lt;ref name="sloanJM"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dsloan.com/Auctions/A12/64WebA12.htm | title=Auction 12: The Zamorano 80 Collection of Daniel G.
