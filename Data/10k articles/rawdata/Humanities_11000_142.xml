Various astronomical alignments and numerological formulae were proposed as pertaining to this date. A [[New Age]] interpretation held that the date marked the start of a period during which Earth and its inhabitants would undergo a positive physical or [[spiritual transformation]], and that 21 December 2012 would mark the beginning of a new era.&lt;ref name="anasatas" /&gt; Others suggested that the date marked the [[End time|end of the world]] or a similar catastrophe. Scenarios suggested for the end of the world included the arrival of the next [[solar maximum]], an interaction between [[Earth]] and the [[Sagittarius A*|black hole at the center of the galaxy]],&lt;ref name="NASA1" /&gt; or [[Nibiru cataclysm|Earth's collision with a mythical planet called Nibiru]].

Scholars from various disciplines quickly dismissed predictions of concomitant cataclysmic events as they arose. Professional [[Mayanist]] scholars stated that no extant [[Maya codices|classic Maya accounts]] forecast impending doom, and that the idea that the Long Count calendar ends in 2012 misrepresented [[Maya civilization#History|Maya history]] and culture,&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuart"&gt;David Stuart, ''The Order of Days: The Maya World and the Truth about 2012'', Harmony Books, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webster" /&gt; while astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios as [[pseudoscience]],&lt;ref name="Brown 2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=SI do not ♥ pseudo-science|first=Mike|last=Brown|url=http://www.mikebrownsplanets.com/2008/02/i-do-not-pseudo-science.html|year=2008|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nibiru and Doomsday 2012: Questions and Answers" /&gt; easily refuted by elementary astronomical observations.&lt;ref name="NASA2" /&gt;

== Mesoamerican Long Count calendar ==
{{main|Mesoamerican Long Count calendar}}

December 2012 marked the conclusion of a ''[[b'ak'tun]]''—a time period in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, used in [[Mesoamerica|Central America]] prior to the arrival of Europeans. Although the Long Count was most likely invented by the [[Olmec]],&lt;ref name="delara2006" /&gt; it has become closely associated with the [[Maya civilization]], whose classic period lasted from 250 to 900&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name="Population structure of the classic period Maya" /&gt; The [[Maya script|writing system]] of the classic Maya has been substantially deciphered,&lt;ref name="joyce" /&gt; meaning that a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of their written and inscribed material has survived from before the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán|European conquest]].

Unlike the 260-day ''[[tzolk'in]]'' still used today among the Maya, the Long Count was linear rather than cyclical, and kept time roughly in units of 20: 20 days made a ''uinal'', 18 uinals (360 days) made a ''tun'', 20 tuns made a ''k'atun'', and 20 k'atuns (144,000 days or roughly 394 years) made up a ''b'ak'tun''. Thus, the Maya date of 8.3.2.10.15 represents 8 b'ak'tuns, 3 k'atuns, 2 tuns, 10 uinals and 15 days.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=246}}&lt;ref name="The Astronomical Insignificance of Maya Date 13.0.0.0.0" /&gt;

=== Apocalypse ===
[[File:Popol vuh.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The oldest surviving manuscript of the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', dated to 1701|alt=an ancient manuscript page.]]

There is a strong tradition of "world ages" in Maya literature, but the record has been distorted, leaving several possibilities open to interpretation.{{sfn|Severin|1981|p=75}} According to the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', a compilation of the [[Mesoamerican creation accounts|creation accounts]] of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]] of the Colonial-era highlands, we are living in the fourth world.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=429–430}} The ''Popol Vuh'' describes the gods first creating three failed worlds, followed by a successful fourth world in which humanity was placed. In the Maya Long Count, the previous world ended after 13 b'ak'tuns, or roughly 5,125 years.{{sfn|Freidel|Schele|Parker|1993|p=63}}{{ref label|A|Note a|a}} The Long Count's "zero date"{{ref label|B|Note b|b}}{{ref label|C|Note c|c}} was set at a point in the past marking the end of the third world and the beginning of the current one, which corresponds to 11 August 3114&amp;nbsp;BC in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]].{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=46}}&lt;ref name=yucalandia/&gt; This means that the fourth world reached the end of its 13th b'ak'tun, or Maya date 13.0.0.0.0, on 21 December 2012. In 1957, Mayanist and astronomer [[Maud Worcester Makemson]] wrote that "the completion of a Great Period of 13 b'ak'tuns would have been of the utmost significance to the Maya."&lt;ref name="makemson1957" /&gt; In 1966, [[Michael D. Coe]] wrote in ''The Maya'' that "there is a suggestion&amp;nbsp;... that Armageddon would overtake the degenerate peoples of the world and all creation on the final day of the 13th [b'ak'tun]. Thus&amp;nbsp;... our present universe [would] be annihilated ... when the Great Cycle of the Long Count reaches completion."{{sfn|Coe|1966|p=149}}{{ref label|E|Note e|e}}

=== Objections ===
Coe's interpretation was repeated by other scholars through the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="carrasco1990" /&gt; In contrast, later researchers said that, while the end of the 13th b'ak'tun would perhaps be a cause for celebration,&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; it did not mark the end of the calendar.&lt;ref name="milbrath1999" /&gt; "There is nothing in the Maya or Aztec or ancient Mesoamerican prophecy to suggest that they prophesied a sudden or major change of any sort in 2012," said Mayanist scholar Mark Van Stone. "The notion of a 'Great Cycle' coming to an end is completely a modern invention."&lt;ref name="van" /&gt; In 1990, Mayanist scholars [[Linda Schele]] and David Freidel argued that the Maya "did not conceive this to be the end of creation, as many have suggested".{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=81–82, 430–431}} Susan Milbrath, [[curator]] of Latin American Art and Archaeology at the [[Florida Museum of Natural History]], stated that, "We have no record or knowledge that [the Maya] would think the world would come to an end" in 2012.&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, said, "For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle," and, "The 2012 phenomenon is a complete fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in."&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; "There will be another cycle," said E. Wyllys Andrews V, director of the [[Tulane University]] Middle American Research Institute. "We know the Maya thought there was one before this, and that implies they were comfortable with the idea of another one after this."&lt;ref name="The Sky Is Not Falling" /&gt; Commenting on the new calendar found at [[Xultún]], one archaeologist said "The ancient Maya predicted the world would continue&amp;nbsp;– that 7,000 years from now, things would be exactly like this. We keep looking for endings. The Maya were looking for a guarantee that nothing would change. It's an entirely different mindset."&lt;ref name="NG120510" /&gt;

Several prominent individuals representing Maya of Guatemala decried the suggestion that the world would end with the 13th b'ak'tun. Ricardo Cajas, president of the ''Colectivo de Organizaciones Indígenas de Guatemala'', said the date did not represent an end of humanity but that the new cycle "supposes changes in human consciousness". Martín Sacalxot, of the office of the ''[[Procuraduría de los Derechos Humanos (Guatemala)|Procurador de los Derechos Humanos]]'' (Guatemala's Human Rights Ombudsman, PDH), said that the end of the calendar has nothing to do with the end of the world or the year 2012.&lt;ref name="prensalibre" /&gt;

=== Prior associations ===
The European association of the Maya with eschatology dates back to the time of [[Christopher Columbus]], who was compiling a work called ''[[Book of Prophecies|Libro de las profecías]]'' during the voyage in 1502 when he first heard about the "Maia" on [[Guanaja]], an island off the north coast of [[Honduras]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Hoopes 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the writings of Bishop [[Pierre d'Ailly]], Columbus believed that his discovery of "most distant" lands (and, by extension, the Maya themselves) was prophesied and would bring about the [[Apocalypse]]. End-times fears were widespread during the early years of the [[Spanish Conquest]] as the result of popular [[astrology|astrological]] predictions in Europe of a second [[Great Flood]] for the year 1524.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

In the early 1900s, German scholar [[Ernst Förstemann]] interpreted the last page of the [[Dresden Codex]] as a representation of the end of the world in a cataclysmic flood. He made reference to the destruction of the world and an apocalypse, though he made no reference to the 13th b'ak'tun or 2012 and it was not clear that he was referring to a future event.&lt;ref&gt;Förstemann 1906: 264&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas were repeated by archaeologist [[Sylvanus Morley]],&lt;ref&gt;Morley 1915: 32&lt;/ref&gt; who directly paraphrased Förstemann and added his own embellishments, writing, "Finally, on the last page of the manuscript, is depicted the Destruction of the World&amp;nbsp;... Here, indeed, is portrayed with a graphic touch the final all-engulfing cataclysm" in the form of a great flood. These comments were later repeated in Morley's book, ''The Ancient Maya'', the first edition of which was published in 1946.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

== Maya references to b'ak'tun 13 ==
It is not certain what significance the classic [[Maya civilization|Maya]] gave to the 13th b'ak'tun.&lt;ref name="Houston1996" /&gt; Most classic Maya inscriptions are strictly historical and do not make any prophetic declarations.&lt;ref name="Houston1996" /&gt; Two items in the Maya classical corpus, however, do mention the end of the 13th b'ak'tun: Tortuguero Monument 6 and La Corona Hieroglyphic Stairway 12.

=== Tortuguero ===
The [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]] site, which lies in southernmost [[Tabasco]], Mexico, dates from the 7th century AD and consists of a series of inscriptions mostly in honor of the contemporary ruler Bahlam Ajaw. One inscription, known as Tortuguero Monument 6, is the only inscription known to refer to b'ak'tun 13 in any detail. It has been partially defaced; Sven Gronemeyer and Barbara MacLeod have given this translation:

&lt;div style="width: 500px"&gt;
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
: ''tzuhtzjo:m uy-u:xlaju:n pik''
: ''chan ajaw u:x uni:w''
: ''uhto:m il[?]''
: ''ye'ni/ye:n bolon yokte'''
: ''ta chak joyaj''
{{col-2}}
: It will be completed the 13th ''b'ak'tun''.
: It is 4 ''Ajaw'' 3 ''K'ank'in''
: and it will happen a 'seeing'[?].
: It is the display of ''B'olon-Yokte'''
: in a great "investiture".{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|p=8}}
{{col-end}}
&lt;/div&gt;

[[File:Bolon Yokte' K'uh.jpg|thumb|The Tortuguero monument connects the end of the 13th b'ak'tun with the appearance of B'olon Yokte' K'uh, shown here on the Vase of Seven Gods.|alt=Vase illustration in which the god Bolon Yukte is seen in profile, kneeling with his head back and his mouth open. He wears an elaborate feather headdress.]]

Very little is known about the god B'olon Yokte'. According to an article by Mayanists Markus Eberl and Christian Prager in ''British Anthropological Reports'', his name is composed of the elements "nine", 'OK-te' (the meaning of which is unknown), and "god". Confusion in classical period inscriptions suggests that the name was already ancient and unfamiliar to contemporary scribes.&lt;ref name="eberl2005" /&gt; He also appears in inscriptions from [[Palenque]], [[Usumacinta]], and [[La Mar]] as a god of war, conflict, and the underworld. In one [[Maya stelae|stele]] he is portrayed with a rope tied around his neck, and in another with an incense bag, together signifying a sacrifice to end a cycle of years.&lt;ref name="hieroglyphic" /&gt;

Based on observations of modern Maya rituals, Gronemeyer and MacLeod claim that the stela refers to a celebration in which a person portraying Bolon Yokte' K'uh was wrapped in ceremonial garments and paraded around the site.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=11, 36–37}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} They note that the association of Bolon Yokte' K'uh with b'ak'tun 13 appears to be so important on this inscription that it supersedes more typical celebrations such as "erection of stelae, scattering of incense" and so forth. Furthermore, they assert that this event was indeed planned for 2012 and not the 7th century.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=24, 35}} Mayanist scholar [[Stephen D. Houston|Stephen Houston]] contests this view by arguing that future dates on Maya inscriptions were simply meant to draw parallels with contemporary events, and that the words on the stela describe a contemporary rather than a future scene.&lt;ref name="What Will Not Happen in 2012" /&gt;

=== La Corona ===
In April–May 2012, a team of archaeologists unearthed a previously unknown inscription on a stairway at the [[La Corona]] site in [[Guatemala]]. The inscription, on what is known as Hieroglyphic Stairway 12, describes the establishment of a royal court in [[Calakmul]] in 635 AD, and compares the then-recent completion of 13 k'atuns with the future completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. It contains no speculation or prophecy as to what the scribes believed would happen at that time.&lt;ref name="Stuart 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title = Notes on a New Text from La Corona | first = David | last = Stuart | url = http://decipherment.wordpress.com/ | year = 2012 | accessdate = 6 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dates beyond b'ak'tun 13 ===
Maya inscriptions occasionally mention predicted future events or commemorations that would occur on dates far beyond the completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. Most of these are in the form of "distance dates"; Long Count dates together with an additional number, known as a Distance Number, which when added to them makes a future date. On the west panel at the [[Temple of Inscriptions]] in Palenque, a section of text projects forward to the 80th 52-year [[Calendar Round]] from the coronation of the ruler [[K'inich Janaab' Pakal]]. Pakal's accession occurred on 9.9.2.4.8, equivalent to 27 July 615&amp;nbsp;AD in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The inscription begins with Pakal's birthdate of 9.8.9.13.0 (24 March, {{nowrap|603&amp;nbsp;AD Gregorian}}) and then adds the Distance Number 10.11.10.5.8 to it,{{sfn|Schele|1992|pp=93–95}} arriving at a date of 21 October 4772&amp;nbsp;AD, more than 4,000 years after Pakal's time.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;{{sfn|Schele|1992|pp=93–95}}{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=430}}

Another example is Stela 1 at [[Coba]] which marks the date of creation as {{nowrap|13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.0.0.0.0}}, or nineteen units above the b'ak'tun. According to Linda Schele, these 13s represent "the starting point of a huge odometer of time", with each acting as a zero and resetting to 1 as the numbers increase.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=81–82, 430–431}}{{ref label|C|Note c|c}} Thus this inscription anticipates the current universe lasting at least 20&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;×13×360 days,&lt;ref name=wagner/&gt; or roughly 2.687×10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; years; a time span equal to 2 quintillion times the [[age of the universe]] as determined by cosmologists. Others have suggested, however, that this date marks creation as having occurred after that time span.&lt;ref name=wagner&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Maya Creation Myths and Cosmography|author=Wagner, Elizabeth|editor=Grube, Nikolai|title=Maya: Divine Kings of the Rainforest|page=283|year=2000|publisher=Konemann|isbn=978-3-8290-4150-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=49}}

In 2012, researchers announced the discovery of a series of Maya astronomical tables in [[Xultún]], Guatemala which plot the movements of the Moon and other astronomical bodies over the course of 17 b'ak'tuns.&lt;ref name="NG120510"&gt;{{cite web | last = Vance | first = Eric | title = Unprecedented Maya Mural Found, Contradicts 2012 "Doomsday" Myth |work=National Geographic |date=10 May 2012 | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/05/120510-maya-2012-doomsday-calendar-end-of-world-science/ |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saturno et al. 11 May 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Science | date = 11 May 2012 | volume = 336 | issue = 6082 | pages = 714–717 | doi = 10.1126/science.1221444 | title = Ancient Maya Astronomical Tables from Xultun, Guatemala |author1=William A.

The general intent of this literature was not to warn of impending doom but "to foster counter-cultural sympathies and eventually socio-political and 'spiritual' activism".&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt; Aveni, who has studied New Age and [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI) communities, describes 2012 narratives as the product of a "disconnected" society: "Unable to find spiritual answers to life's big questions within ourselves, we turn outward to imagined entities that lie far off in space or time—entities that just might be in possession of superior knowledge."{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=161}}

=== Origins ===
In 1975, the ending of b'ak'tun 13 became the subject of speculation by several New Age authors, who asserted it would correspond with a global "transformation of consciousness". In ''Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth Age of Consciousness'', [[Frank Waters]] tied Coe's original date of 24 December 2011{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} to astrology and the prophecies of the [[Hopi]],&lt;ref name="particular" /&gt; while both [[José Argüelles]] (in ''The Transformative Vision'')&lt;ref name="elles1975" /&gt; and [[Terence McKenna]] (in ''The Invisible Landscape'')&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mckenna1993" /&gt; discussed the significance of the year 2012 without mentioning a specific day.

In 1983, with the publication of [[Robert J. Sharer]]'s revised table of date correlations in the 4th edition of Morley's ''The Ancient Maya,''{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} each became convinced that 21 December 2012 had significant meaning. By 1987, the year in which he organized the [[Harmonic Convergence]] event, Arguelles was using the date 21 December 2012 in ''The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology''.&lt;ref name="Planets Won't Attend Astronomical Celebration" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elles1987" /&gt; He claimed that on 13 August 3113 BC the Earth began a passage through a "galactic synchronization beam" that emanated from the [[Galactic Center|center of our galaxy]], that it would pass through this beam during a period of 5200 ''tuns'' (Maya cycles of 360 days each), and that this beam would result in "total synchronization" and "galactic entrainment" of individuals "plugged into the Earth's electromagnetic battery" by 13.0.0.0.0 (21 December 2012). He believed that the Maya aligned their calendar to correspond to this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="scare" /&gt; Anthony Aveni has dismissed all of these ideas.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|pp=17–27}}

In 2006, author [[Daniel Pinchbeck]] popularized New Age concepts about this date in his book ''2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl'', linking b'ak'tun 13 to beliefs in [[crop circles]], [[alien abduction]], and personal revelations based on the use of [[hallucinogenic drugs]] and [[mediumship]].&lt;ref name="Pinchbeck 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The End of the World As They Know It" /&gt; Pinchbeck claims to discern a "growing realization that materialism and the rational, empirical worldview that comes with it has reached its expiration date&amp;nbsp;... [w]e're on the verge of transitioning to a dispensation of consciousness that's more intuitive, mystical and shamanic".&lt;ref name="anasatas" /&gt;

=== Galactic alignment ===
There is no significant astronomical event tied to the Long Count's start date.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=83}} However, its supposed end date was tied to astronomical phenomena by [[esoteric]], [[fringe science|fringe]], and [[New Age]] literature that placed great significance on [[astrology]], especially astrological interpretations associated with the phenomenon of [[axial precession]].&lt;ref name="Hoopes2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoopes2012" /&gt; Chief among these ideas is the astrological concept of a "galactic alignment".

==== Precession ====
In the [[Solar System]], the planets and the [[Sun]] lie roughly within the same flat plane, known as the [[plane of the ecliptic]]. From our perspective on [[Earth]], the [[ecliptic]] is the path taken by the Sun across the sky over the course of the year. The twelve [[constellation]]s that line the ecliptic are known as the [[zodiac]]al constellations and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation approximately every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called "[[Precession of the equinoxes|precession]]", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a [[spinning top]] wobbles as it slows down.&lt;ref name="prec" /&gt; Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a [[Great Year]], the Sun's path completes a full, 360-degree backward rotation through the zodiac.&lt;ref name="prec" /&gt; In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the [[March equinox]], one of the two annual points at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, the Sun's March equinox position was in the constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] moving back into [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. This signaled the end of one [[astrological age]] (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the [[Age of Aquarius]]).{{sfn|Spencer|2000|pp=115–127}}

Similarly, the Sun's December [[solstice]] position (in the northern hemisphere, the lowest point on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name="Teapot of Sagittarius points to galactic center" /&gt; Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (from the surface of the Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it.&lt;ref name="What's going to happen on 21 December 2012?" /&gt; In 2012 it was about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the [[galactic equator]].&lt;ref name="starry" /&gt; In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.&lt;ref name="Questions and comments" /&gt;

==== Mysticism ====
[[File:Milkyway Swan Panorama.jpg|thumb|400px|The Milky Way near [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] showing the lane of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Dark Rift]], which the Maya called the ''Xibalba be'' or "Black Road"|alt=a photograph of the Milky Way, rotated 90 degrees]]

Mystical speculations about the [[precession]] of the equinoxes and the Sun's proximity to the center of the Milky Way appeared in ''[[Hamlet's Mill]]'' (1969) by [[Giorgio de Santillana]] and Hertha von Deschend. These were quoted and expanded upon by [[Terence McKenna|Terence]] and [[Dennis McKenna]] in ''The Invisible Landscape'' (1975). 

Adherents to the idea, following a theory first proposed by [[Munro Edmonson]],{{sfn|Edmonson|1988|p=119}} alleged that the Maya based their calendar on observations of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Great Rift]] or Dark Rift, a band of dark dust clouds in the Milky Way, which, according to some scholars, the Maya called the ''[[Xibalba|Xibalba be]]'' or "Black Road".&lt;ref name="Xibalba or Xibalbe" /&gt; John Major Jenkins claims that the Maya were aware of where the ecliptic intersected the Black Road and gave this position in the sky a special significance in their cosmology.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2012" /&gt; Jenkins said that precession would align the Sun precisely with the galactic equator at the 2012 winter solstice.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2012" /&gt; Jenkins claimed that the classical Maya anticipated this conjunction and celebrated it as the harbinger of a profound spiritual transition for mankind.&lt;ref name="The Mayan Calendar and the Transformation of Consciousness" /&gt; New Age proponents of the galactic alignment hypothesis argued that, just as astrology uses the positions of stars and planets to make claims of future events, the Maya plotted their calendars with the objective of preparing for significant world events.&lt;ref name="pinchbeck2006" /&gt; Jenkins attributed the insights of ancient Maya [[shamans]] about the [[galactic center]] to their use of [[psilocybin mushrooms]], [[psychoactive toad]]s, and other [[psychedelics]].&lt;ref name="jenkins1998" /&gt; Jenkins also associated the ''Xibalba be'' with a "world tree", drawing on studies of contemporary (not ancient) Maya cosmology.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=62}}

==== Criticism ====
Astronomers such as [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]] argue that the galactic equator is an entirely arbitrary line and can never be precisely drawn, because it is impossible to determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above {{convert|11000|ft|m}}, an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to.&lt;ref name="scare" /&gt; Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.&lt;ref name="jenk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The True Alignment Zone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="meeus1997" /&gt;

There is no clear evidence that the classic Maya were aware of precession. Some Maya scholars, such as Barbara MacLeod,{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} Michael Grofe,&lt;ref name="grofe2011" /&gt; Eva Hunt, Gordon Brotherston, and Anthony Aveni,&lt;ref name="jenkins2009" /&gt; have suggested that some Mayan holy dates were timed to precessional cycles, but scholarly opinion on the subject remains divided.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt; There is also little evidence, archaeological or historical, that the Maya placed any importance on solstices or equinoxes.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aimers, J. J., and Rice, P. M. 2006 79–96" /&gt; It is possible that only the earliest among Mesoamericans observed solstices,{{refn|{{harvnb|Aveni|2009|pp=54–55}}, citing {{harvnb|Aveni|Hartung|2000}}.}} but this is also a disputed issue among Mayanists.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aimers, J. J., and Rice, P. M. 2006 79–96" /&gt; There is also no evidence that the classic Maya attached any importance to the Milky Way; there is no glyph in their writing system to represent it, and no astronomical or chronological table tied to it.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=57}}

=== Timewave zero and the ''I Ching'' ===
{{Main|Terence McKenna#Novelty theory and Timewave Zero}}
[[File:Timewave 9 11 2001.png|thumb|A screenshot of the "Timewave Zero" software|alt=a greyscale graph with multiple, jagged peaks and troughs and an overall descending pattern, set amidst complex virtual instrumentation]]
"Timewave zero" is a [[numerology|numerological]] formula that purports to calculate the ebb and flow of "novelty", defined as increase over time in the [[universe]]'s interconnectedness, or [[Complexity#Disorganized complexity vs. organized complexity|organized complexity]].&lt;ref name="TMobAB" /&gt; [[Terence McKenna]] claimed that the universe has a [[teleological]] [[attractor]] at the [[Ultimate fate of the universe|end of time]] that increases interconnectedness. He believed this which would eventually reach a [[technological singularity|singularity]] of infinite complexity in 2012, at which point anything and everything imaginable would occur simultaneously. He conceived this idea over several years in the early to mid-1970s whilst using psilocybin mushrooms and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]].&lt;ref name="TMobAB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitesides2012" /&gt; The [[scientific community]] considers novelty theory to be [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name=bruce&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=A. |year=2009 |title=2012: Science Or Superstition (the Definitive Guide to the Doomsday Phenomenon) |publisher=The Disinformation Company |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-rVUCO4YyYC&amp;pg=PA261|isbn=978-1-934708-51-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=normark&gt;{{cite web |title=2012: Prophet of nonsense #8: Terence McKenna – Novelty theory and timewave zero |last=Normark |first=Johan |url=http://haecceities.wordpress.com/2009/06/16/2012-prophet-of-nonsense-8-terence-mckenna%E2%80%93-novelty-theory-and-timewave-zero/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKenna expressed "novelty" in a computer program which produces a waveform known as "timewave zero" or the "timewave". Based on McKenna's interpretation of the [[King Wen sequence]] of the ''[[I Ching]]'', an ancient Chinese book on [[divination]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; the graph purports to show great periods of novelty corresponding with major shifts in humanity's [[evolution|biological]] and [[sociocultural evolution|sociocultural]] evolution. He believed that the events of any given time are resonantly related to the events of other times, and chose the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]] as the basis for calculating his end date of November 2012.&lt;ref name="Dynamics of Hyperspace" /&gt; When he later discovered this date's proximity to the end of the 13th b'ak'tun of the Maya calendar, he revised his hypothesis so that the two dates matched.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt;

The 1975 first edition of ''The Invisible Landscape'' referred to 2012 (but no specific day during the year) only twice. In the 1993 second edition, McKenna employed Sharer's date{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} of 21 December 2012 throughout.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitesides2012" /&gt;

Novelty theory has been criticized for "rejecting countless ideas presumed as factual by the scientific community", depending "solely on numerous controversial deductions that contradict empirical logic", and encompassing "no suitable indication of truth", with the conclusion that novelty theory is a pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Smith II D.

The idea that the year 2012 presaged a world cataclysm, the end of the world, or the end of [[human civilization]], became a subject of popular media speculation as the date of 21 December 2012 approached. This idea was promulgated by many pages on the [[Internet]], particularly on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; [[The Discovery Channel]] was criticized for its "quasi-documentaries" about the subject that "sacrifice[d] accuracy for entertainment".&lt;ref name="PressSunBulletin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pressconnects.com/article/20121210/NEWS01/312110007/Cornell-Maya-expert-World-probably-won-t-end-Dec-21?odyssey=nav%7Chead|title=Cornell Maya expert: World probably won't end Dec. 21 |last=D.W.

=== Other alignments ===
Some people interpreted the galactic alignment apocalyptically, claiming that its occurrence would somehow create a combined [[gravitation]]al effect between the Sun and the [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of our galaxy (known as [[Sagittarius A*]]), creating havoc on Earth.&lt;ref name="krupp" /&gt; Apart from the "galactic alignment" already having happened in 1998, the Sun's apparent path through the zodiac as seen from Earth did not take it near the true galactic center, but rather several degrees above it.&lt;ref name="starry" /&gt; Even were this not the case, Sagittarius A* is 30,000 [[light year]]s from Earth; it would have to have been more than 6 million times closer to cause any gravitational disruption to Earth's Solar System.&lt;ref name="Questions answered" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What would happen if a supermassive black hole came close to the Earth?" /&gt; This reading of the alignment was included on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] documentary ''Decoding the Past''. John Major Jenkins complained that a science fiction writer co-authored the documentary, and he went on to characterize it as "45&amp;nbsp;minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and the worst kind of inane sensationalism".&lt;ref name="How Not to Make a 2012 Documentary" /&gt;

Some believers in a 2012 doomsday used the term "galactic alignment" to describe a different phenomenon proposed by some scientists to explain a pattern in [[mass extinction]]s supposedly observed in the [[fossil record]].&lt;ref name="fraser" /&gt; According to the [[Shiva Hypothesis]], mass extinctions are not random, but recur every 26 million years. To account for this, it was suggested that vertical oscillations made by the Sun on its [[Galactic year|250-million-year orbit]] of the galactic center cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic plane which bisects the [[galactic disc]], the influence of the [[galactic tide]] is weaker. However, when re-entering the galactic disc—as it does every 20–25&amp;nbsp;million years—it comes under the influence of the far stronger "disc tides", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of [[Oort cloud]] comets into the inner Solar System by a factor of 4, thus leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating comet impact.&lt;ref name="Perturbing the Oort Cloud" /&gt; However, this "alignment" takes place over tens of millions of years, and could never be timed to an exact date.&lt;ref name="Galactic Plane" /&gt; Evidence shows that the Sun passed through the plane bisecting the galactic disc three million years ago and in 2012 was moving farther above it.&lt;ref name="The Sun's motion perpendicular to the galactic plane" /&gt;

A third suggested alignment was some sort of planetary [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] occurring on 21 December 2012; however, there was no conjunction on that date.&lt;ref name="Nibiru and Doomsday 2012: Questions and Answers" /&gt; Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth.&lt;ref name="Planetary Alignment" /&gt; [[Jupiter]] is the [[List of Solar System objects by size#Objects above ≈300&amp;nbsp;km in radius|largest]] planet in the Solar System; larger than all other planets combined. When Jupiter is near [[Opposition (planets)|opposition]], the difference in gravitational force that the Earth experiences is less than 1% of the force that the Earth feels daily from the Moon.&lt;ref name="Plait-alignment" /&gt;

=== Geomagnetic reversal ===
Another idea tied to 2012 involved a [[geomagnetic reversal]] (often referred to as a [[pole shift]] by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive [[solar flare]], that would release an energy equal to 100&amp;nbsp;billion [[atomic bombs]].&lt;ref name="2012: No Killer Solar Flare" /&gt; This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's [[magnetic field]] was weakening,&lt;ref name="Rapidly changing flows in the Earth's core" /&gt; which could precede a reversal of the north and south [[Poles of astronomical bodies|magnetic poles]], and the arrival of the next [[solar maximum]], which was expected sometime around 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Storm Warning|publisher=NASA|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/10mar_stormwarning/|year=2006|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scientific estimates, however, say that geomagnetic reversals take between 1,000 and 10,000 years to complete,&lt;ref name="Merrill"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Merrill | first1 = Ronald T. | last2 = McElhinny | first2 = Michael W. | last3 = McFadden | first3 = Philip L. | title = The magnetic field of the earth: paleomagnetism, the core, and the deep mantle|publisher=[[Academic Press]] | year = 1998|isbn=978-0-12-491246-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not start on any particular date.&lt;ref name="Geomagnetic Reversal" /&gt; Furthermore, the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] predicted that the solar maximum would peak in late 2013 or 2014, and that it would be fairly weak, with a below-average number of [[sunspots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Maximum: Three Solar Flares And A Coronal Mass Ejection As The Sun Reaches Peak Solar Activity|publisher=NASA|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/solar-maximum-three-solar-flares-coronal-mass-ejection-sun-reaches-peak-solar-activity-1442608|year=2013|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, there was no scientific evidence linking a solar maximum to a geomagnetic reversal, which is driven by forces entirely within the Earth.&lt;ref name="2012: No Geomagnetic Reversal" /&gt; Instead, a solar maximum would be mostly notable for its effects on satellite and cellular phone communications.&lt;ref name="goemag" /&gt; David Morrison attributed the rise of the solar storm idea to physicist and science popularizer [[Michio Kaku]], who claimed in an interview with [[Fox News]] that a solar peak in 2012 could be disastrous for orbiting satellites, and to NASA's headlining a 2006 webpage as "Solar Storm Warning", a term later repeated on several doomsday pages.&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt;

=== Planet X/Nibiru ===
{{main|Nibiru cataclysm}}

Some believers in a 2012 doomsday claimed that a planet called Planet&amp;nbsp;X, or Nibiru, would collide with or pass by the Earth. This idea, which appeared in various forms since 1995, initially predicted Doomsday in May 2003, but proponents abandoned that date after it passed without incident.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt; The idea originated from claims of channeling [[grey aliens|alien beings]] and is widely ridiculed.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt;{{sfn|Schilling|2008|p=111}} Astronomers calculated that such an object so close to Earth would be visible to anyone looking up at the night sky.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt;

=== Other catastrophes ===
[[File:Pleiades large.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pleiades]], a [[star cluster]] with supposed influence sometimes tied to the 2012 event|alt=The Pleiades star cluster]]

Author [[Graham Hancock]], in his book ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'', interpreted Coe's remarks in ''Breaking the Maya Code''{{sfn|Coe|1992|pp=275–276}} as evidence for the prophecy of a global cataclysm.&lt;ref name="hancock" /&gt; Filmmaker [[Roland Emmerich]] later credited the book with inspiring his 2009 [[disaster film]] ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]''.&lt;ref name="chicagoscifi credits"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://chicagoscifi.com/movies/0011/presskit_pages/credits.pdf | title = 2012 (2009)&amp;nbsp;– Credit List |accessdate=25 November 2009 |publisher=chicagoscifi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other speculations regarding doomsday in 2012 included predictions by the [[Web Bot]] project, a computer program that purports to predict the future by analyzing Internet chatter. However, commentators have rejected claims that the bot is able to predict natural disasters, as opposed to human-caused disasters like stock market crashes.&lt;ref name="'Web-bot project' makes prophecy of 2012 apocalypse" /&gt;

The 2012 date was also loosely tied to the long-running concept of the [[Photon Belt]], which predicted a form of interaction between Earth and [[Alcyone (star)|Alcyone]], the largest star of the [[Pleiades cluster]].&lt;ref name="morris2" /&gt; Critics argued that photons cannot form belts, that the Pleiades, located more than 400 light years away, could have no effect on Earth, and that the Solar System, rather than getting closer to the Pleiades, was in fact moving farther away from it.&lt;ref name="Is the earth about to enter the Photon Belt, causing the end of life as we know it?" /&gt;

Some media outlets tied the fact that the [[red supergiant]] star [[Betelgeuse]] would undergo a [[supernova]] at some point in the future to the 2012 phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Connelly 19 January 2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/sci-tech/tatooines-twin-suns-coming-to-a-planet-near-you-just-as-soon-as-betelgeuse-explodes/story-fn5fsgyc-1225991009247 |title=Tatooine's twin suns&amp;nbsp;– coming to a planet near you just as soon as Betelgeuse explodes |last=Connelly |first=Claire |work=News.com.au |date=19 January 2011 |accessdate=14 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922083805/http://www.news.com.au/technology/sci-tech/tatooines-twin-suns-coming-to-a-planet-near-you-just-as-soon-as-betelgeuse-explodes/story-fn5fsgyc-1225991009247 |archivedate=22 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Betelgeuse was certainly in the final stages of its life, and would die as a supernova, there was no way to predict the timing of the event to within 100,000 years.&lt;ref name="Betelgeuse and 2012" /&gt; To be a threat to Earth, a supernova would need to be no further than 25 light years from the Solar System. Betelgeuse is roughly 600 light years away, and so its supernova would not affect Earth.&lt;ref name="Is Betelgeuse about to blow?" /&gt; In December 2011, NASA's [[Francis Reddy]] issued a press release debunking the possibility of a supernova occurring in 2012.&lt;ref name="Reddy 2011"&gt;{{cite web | title = 2012: Fear No Supernova | publisher = NASA | last = Reddy | first = Francis | url = http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012-supernova.html | year = 2011 | accessdate = 23 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another claim involved [[alien invasion]]. In December 2010, an article, first published in [[examiner.com]] and later referenced in the English-language edition of ''[[Pravda]]''&lt;ref name="NO Spaceships Headed for Earth" /&gt; claimed, citing a Second [[Digitized Sky Survey]] photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012.&lt;ref name="philp" /&gt; Astronomer and debunker [[Phil Plait]] noted that by using the [[small-angle formula]], one could determine that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, it would have had to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived.&lt;ref name="philp" /&gt; In January 2011, [[Seth Shostak]], chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.&lt;ref name="NO Spaceships Headed for Earth" /&gt;

Beginning in 2000, the small French village of [[Bugarach]], population 189, began receiving visits from "esoterics"—mystic believers who had concluded that the local mountain, [[Pic de Bugarach]], was the ideal location to weather the transformative events of 2012. In 2011, the local mayor, Jean-Pierre Delord, began voicing fears to the international press that the small town would be overwhelmed by an influx of thousands of visitors in 2012, even suggesting he might call in the army.&lt;ref name="For End of the World, a French Peak Holds Allure" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Samuel 2010" /&gt; "We've seen a huge rise in visitors", Delord told ''[[The Independent]]'' in March 2012. "Already this year more than 20,000 people have climbed right to the top, and last year we had 10,000 hikers, which was a significant rise on the previous 12 months. They think Pic de Bugarach is 'un garage à ovnis' [a garage for [[UFO]]s]. The villagers are exasperated: the exaggerated importance of something which they see as completely removed from reality is bewildering. After 21 December, this will surely return to normal."&lt;ref name=hippies /&gt; In December 2012, the French government placed 100 police and firefighters around both Bugarach and Pic de Bugarach, limiting access to potential visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayan Doomsday: French Police Block Access to Survivors' Refuge Pic de Bugarach|author=Hanna Osborne|publisher=International Business Times|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/407669/20121122/mayan-prophecy-doomsday-pic-de-bugarach-aliens.htm|accessdate=13 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129090241/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/407669/20121122/mayan-prophecy-doomsday-pic-de-bugarach-aliens.htm|archivedate=29 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, only about 1,000 visitors appeared at the height of the "event".

== Cultural influence ==
The 2012 phenomenon was discussed or referenced in several media. Several TV documentaries, as well as some contemporary fictional references to the year 2012, referred to 21 December as the day of a cataclysmic event.

The [[UFO conspiracy]] TV series ''[[The X-Files]]'' cited 22 December 2012 as the date for an alien colonization of the Earth and mentioned the [[Mayan calendar]] "stopping" on this date.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt; The [[History (U.S. TV network)|History Channel]] aired a handful of special series on doomsday that included analysis of 2012 theories, such as ''[[Decoding the Past]]'' (2005–2007), ''2012, End of Days'' (2006), ''[[Last Days on Earth]]'' (2006), ''Seven Signs of the Apocalypse'' (2009), and ''Nostradamus 2012'' (2008).&lt;ref name="Armageddon series" /&gt; The [[Discovery Channel]] also aired ''2012 Apocalypse'' in 2009, suggesting that massive [[Geomagnetic storm|solar storms]], [[magnetic pole reversal]], earthquakes, [[supervolcano]]es, and other drastic natural events could occur in 2012.&lt;ref name="2012 Apocalypse" /&gt; In 2012, the [[National Geographic (U.S. TV channel)|National Geographic Channel]] launched a show called ''[[Doomsday Preppers]]'', a documentary series about [[survivalism|survivalists]] preparing for various cataclysms, including the 2012 doomsday.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic Doomsday Preppers"&gt;{{cite web | title = Doomsday Preppers | work = National Geographic | url = http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/doomsday-preppers/ | accessdate = 6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of books were published on the topic.&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; The bestselling book of 2009,&lt;ref name="Best-Selling Books of 2009" /&gt; [[Dan Brown]]'s ''[[The Lost Symbol]]'', featured a coded mock email number (2456282.5) that decoded to the [[Julian date]] for 21 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Secrets of The Lost Symbol|author1=Dan Bernstein |author2=Arne de Kiuzer |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qgqfqUjF_38C&amp;pg=PT35&amp;lpg=PT35&amp;dq=2456282.5+julian+date+%22lost+symbol%22|accessdate=19 December 2012|isbn=978-0-297-86060-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cinema, the 2009 disaster film ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]'' was inspired by the phenomenon, and advance promotion prior to its release included a [[stealth marketing]] campaign in which TV spots and websites from the fictional "Institute for Human Continuity" called on people to prepare for the end of the world. As these promotions did not mention the film itself, many viewers believed them to be real and contacted astronomers in panic.&lt;ref name="sony" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Relax, the end isn't nigh" /&gt; Although the campaign was heavily criticized,&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; the film became one of the most successful of its year, grossing nearly $770&amp;nbsp;million worldwide.&lt;ref name="2009 Worldwide Grosses" /&gt; An article in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' attributed the widespread fear of the 2012 phenomenon in China to the film, which was a smash hit in that country because it depicted the Chinese building "survival arks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China fears end of the world is nigh|author=Malcolm Moore|work=The Daily Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9729270/China-fears-end-of-the-world-is-nigh.html| accessdate=11 December 2012|location=London|date=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lars von Trier]]'s 2011 film ''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]'' featured a plot in which a planet emerges from behind the Sun on a collision course with Earth.&lt;ref name="Sunny Kirsten Dunst is picture perfect at the Cannes photocall for her provocative new film Melancholia" /&gt; Announcing his company's purchase of the film, the head of [[Magnolia Pictures]] said in a press release, "As the 2012 apocalypse is upon us, it is time to prepare for a cinematic last supper".&lt;ref name="Magnolia Picks Up North American Rights to Lars von Trier's 'Melancholia'" /&gt;

The phenomenon also inspired several rock and pop music hits. As early as 1997, "[[A Certain Shade of Green]]" by [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] referred to the mystical belief that a shift in perception would arrive in 2012 ("Are you gonna stand around till 2012 A.D.? / What are you waiting for, a certain shade of green?"). More recent hits include "[[2012 (It Ain't the End)]]" (2010) performed by [[Jay Sean]] and "[[Till the World Ends]]" (2011) performed by [[Britney Spears]]. Towards mid-December 2012, an internet [[hoax]] related to South Korean singer [[Psy]] being one of the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] was widely circulated around social media platforms. The hoax purported that once Psy's "[[Gangnam Style]]" YouTube video amassed a billion views, the world would end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnist/much-ado-about-apocalypse-1.188870 |newspaper=[[New Straits Times]] |title=Much ado about apocalypse |first=Chok |last=Suat Ling |date=20 December 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104174754/http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnist/much-ado-about-apocalypse-1.188870 |archivedate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian composer [[A.

A number of brands ran commercials tied to the 2012 apocalypse in the months and days leading to the date. In February 2012, American automotive company [[General Motors]] aired an advertisement during the annual [[Super Bowl]] [[American football|football game]] in which a group of friends drove [[Chevrolet Silverado]]s through the ruins of human civilization following the 2012 apocalypse, while on 17 December 2012, [[Jell-O]] ran an ad saying that offering Jell-O to the Mayan gods would appease them into sparing the world. John Verret, Professor of Advertising at [[Boston University]], questioned the utility of tying large sums of money to such a unique and short-term event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wong |first=Vanessa |title=Brands Capitalize on 'Impending Apocalypse' |publisher=BusinessWeek |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-12-19/brands-capitalizing-on-the-impending-apocalypse|date=19 December 2012|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==
{{Refbegin|30em}}
* {{note label|A|a|a}} The [[13 (number)|number 13]] plays an important role in Mesoamerican calendrics; the ''[[tzolk'in]]'', or sacred calendar, was divided into 13 months of 20 days each. The Mayan ''may'' cycle consisted of 13 k'atuns. The reason for the number's importance is uncertain, though correlations to the phases of the moon and to the human gestation period have been suggested.{{sfn|Rice|2007|pp=44, 59}}&lt;ref name="The Origin of the 260-day calendar: the gestation hypothesis reconsidered in light of its use among the Quiche Maya" /&gt;
* {{note label|B|b|b}} The Mayan calendar, unlike the Western calendar, used a zero.&lt;ref name="joyce" /&gt;
* {{note label|C|c|c}} Rather than "0.0.0.0.0", the Mayan Long Count represented the date of creation as "13.0.0.0.0"&lt;ref name=wagner/&gt;
* {{note label|D|d|d}} Most Mayanist scholars, such as [[Mark Van Stone]] and Anthony Aveni, adhere to the "GMT (Goodman-Martinez-Thompson) correlation" with the Long Count, which places the start date at 11 August 3114&amp;nbsp;BC and the end date of b'ak'tun 13 at 21 December 2012.&lt;ref name="Who's Who in the Maya World" /&gt; This date was also the overwhelming preference of those who believed in 2012 eschatology, arguably, Van Stone suggests, because it was a solstice, and was thus astrologically significant. Some Mayanist scholars, such as Michael D. Coe, Linda Schele and [[Marc Zender]], adhere to the "Lounsbury/GMT+2" correlation, which sets the start date at 13 August and the end date at 23 December. Which of these is the precise correlation has yet to be conclusively settled.&lt;ref name="Questions and comments" /&gt;
* {{note label|E|e|e}} Coe's initial date was "24 December 2011". He revised it to "11 January AD 2013" in the 1980 2nd edition of his book,{{sfn|Coe|1980|p=151}} not settling on 23 December 2012 until the 1984 3rd edition.{{refn|{{harvnb|Coe|1984}}. This correlation, which differs two days from Sharer's, is repeated in subsequent editions of Coe's book.}} The correlation of b'ak'tun 13 as 21 December 2012 first appeared in Table B.2 of Robert J. Sharer's 1983 revision of the 4th edition of Sylvanus Morley's book ''The Ancient Maya'' {{harv|Morley|1983|p=603|loc=Table B2}}.

'''''A History of God''''' is a book by [[Karen Armstrong]]. It details the history of the three major [[monotheistic]] traditions, [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], along with [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. The evolution of the idea of [[God]] is traced from its ancient roots in the [[Middle East]] up to the present day.

==Summary==

===Judaism===
Armstrong begins with the rise of the [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] of [[Yahweh]] (Jahweh), one of the deities of [[Canaan]]. According to Armstrong, the cult of Yahweh consisted of a variety of ethnic groups that migrated to [[Canaan]] in three waves. These groups were united by their loyalty to Yahweh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Karen|title=A History of God|year=1993|publisher=Ballatine Books|isbn=0-345-38456-3|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yahweh was unique in the ancient Middle East in that he actually participated in the [[wikt:profane|profane]] lives of his worshipers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Karen|title=A History of God|year=1993|publisher=Ballatine Books|isbn=0-345-38456-3|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She then examines the sources of the [[Pentateuch]] by way of the four supposed authors, or groups of authors, known as [[Documentary hypothesis|''J'', ''E'', ''P'' and ''D'']]. Moreover, she explores some of the textual tensions that exist in the [[Pentateuch]] as a result of the theological tensions between these authors, or groups of authors. For Armstrong, this tension can be seen in, for example, the contrasting accounts of [[theophany|theophanies]]. The [[Jahwist]] (J) writes of very "intimate" encounters between Abraham and Yahweh, while the [[Elohist]] (E) "prefers to distance the event and make the old legends less [[anthropomorphic]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Karen|title=A History of God|year=1993|publisher=Ballatine Books|isbn=0-345-38456-3|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There follows an examination of the major [[Israelite]] [[prophet]]s, including [[Isaiah]], second Isaiah, [[Hosea]] and [[Ezekiel]], and the contribution each made to the [[Jewish]] conception of [[God]].

===Christianity===
Armstrong then turns to the stories attributed to the life of [[Jesus]]. She identifies his roots in the [[Pharisees|Pharisaic]] tradition of [[Hillel the Elder]] and his effect on the Jewish conception of a god. The death of Jesus and its attendant symbolism are examined, including the various constructions others, most notably [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], have placed upon these events. 

The book explores the rise of trinitarianism, leading to the [[Nicene Creed]], and traces the evolution of the Christian conception of God and the [[Trinity]] in the respective [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] and [[Western Christianity|Western]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Logic and Reason&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
The rise of [[Islam]] and its appreciation of the nature of God are examined.  Armstrong analyzes how modern [[Shia Islam]], with its emphasis upon social action in the service of [[Allah]], the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], and the [[Shia Imams]], was a key factor that brought about the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979.

Subsequent chapters examine respectively both philosophical approaches to the idea of God, and the mystical relationship with God. 

Armstrong discusses the rise of modern Christian religiosity, in particular the [[Protestantism]] of [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]].

===Conclusion===
The final chapters examine the notion of the ''[[Death of God]]'' and the idea of God in a [[postmodernity|post-modern]] world.

'''Albert Otto Hirschman&lt;ref&gt;or ''Hirshman''.&lt;/ref&gt;''' (born ''Otto-Albert Hirschmann''; April 7, 1915 – December 10, 2012) was an influential  [[economist]] and the author of several books on [[political economy]] and [[political ideology]]. His first major contribution was in the area of [[development economics]].&lt;ref&gt;Hirschman, A. O. (1958) The Strategy of Economic Development. Yale University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Here he emphasized the need for [[unbalanced growth]]. Because developing countries are short of decision making skills, he argued that disequilibria should be encouraged to stimulate growth and help mobilize resources. Key to this was encouraging industries with a large number of linkages to other firms.

His later work was in political economy and there he advanced two simple but intellectually powerful schemata. The first describes the three basic possible responses to [[Decadence|decline]] in firms or polities (quitting, speaking up, staying quiet) in ''[[Exit, Voice, and Loyalty]]'' (1970). The second describes the basic arguments made by [[conservatism|conservatives]] (perversity, futility and jeopardy) in ''[[The Rhetoric of Reaction]]'' (1991).

In [[World War II]], he played a key role in rescuing refugees in [[occupied France]].

==Life==
Otto Albert Hirschmann was born in [[Berlin]], Germany, the son of Carl and Hedwig Marcuse Hirschmann, and brother of [[Ursula Hirschmann]].&lt;ref name="honorary"&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/fachbereich/ehrenpromotionen/hirschman.html Honorary degree awarded to Albert O. Hirschman] by [[Free University of Berlin]]&lt;/ref&gt; After he had started studying in 1932 at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität]], he was educated at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], the [[London School of Economics]] and the [[University of Trieste]], from which he received his doctorate in economics in 1938.&lt;ref name=honorary/&gt;

Soon thereafter, Hirschman volunteered to fight on behalf of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]] in the [[Spanish Civil&amp;nbsp;War]]. After France surrendered to the Nazis, he worked with [[Varian Fry]] to help [[Varian Fry#Refugees aided by Fry|many of Europe's leading artists and intellectuals]] to escape to the United States; Hirschman helped to lead them from [[occupied France]] to Spain through paths in the [[Pyrenees Mountains]] and then to Portugal.

A [[Rockefeller Fellow]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (1941–1943), he served in the [[United States Army]] (1943–1946) where he worked in the [[Office of Strategic Services]],&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/24/business/albert-o-hirschman-economist-and-resistance-figure-dies-at-97.html?_r=0 |title = Albert Hirschman, Optimistic Economist, Dies at 97 |last = Yardley |first = William |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |date = December 23, 2012 |accessdate = July 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was appointed Chief of the Western European and British Commonwealth Section of the [[Federal Reserve Board]] (1946–1952), served as a financial advisor to the [[National Planning Board of Colombia]] (1952–1954) and then became a private economic counselor in [[Bogotá]] (1954–1956).

Following that he held a succession of academic appointments in economics at [[Yale University]] (1956–1958), [[Columbia University]] (1958–1964), [[Harvard University]] (1964–1974) and the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (1974–2012).

Hirschman helped develop the [[hiding hand principle]] in his 1967 essay ''''The principle of the hiding hand''''.

In 2001, Hirschman was named among the top 100 American intellectuals, as measured by academic citations, in [[Richard Posner]]'s book, ''Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Posner|first=Richard|title=Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline|year=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-00633-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, he won the Benjamin E. Lippincott Award from the [[American Political Science Association]] to recognize a work of exceptional quality by a living political theorist for his book ''The Passions and the Interests:  Political Arguments for Capitalism before Its Triumph''.

In 2007, the [[Social Science Research Council]] established an annual prize in honor of Hirschman.&lt;ref name="prize"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssrc.org/hirschman/ |title=Albert O. Hirschman Prize of the Social Science Research Council |publisher=Social Science Research Council |accessdate=July 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died at the age of 97 on December 10, 2012, some months after the passing of his wife of over seventy years, Sarah Hirschman (née Chapiro).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.haaretz.com/cmlink/2.576/.premium-1.630796 |title = Economist who studied progress and fought fascism dies |last = Green |first = David |newspaper = [[Ha’aretz]] |date = October 12, 2014 |accessdate = January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Passions and the Interests''==
This is a history of the ideas laying the intellectual groundwork for capitalism. Hirschman describes how thinkers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries embraced the sin of avarice as an important counterweight to humankind's destructive passions. Capitalism was promoted by thinkers including Montesquieu, Sir James Steuart, and Adam Smith as repressing the passions for "harmless" commercial activities. Hirschman noted that words including "vice" and "passion" gave way to "such bland terms" as "advantage" and "interest."

Hirschman described ''The Passions and the Interests'' as the book he most enjoyed writing. According to Hirschman biographer Jeremy Adelman, the book reflected Hirschman's political moderation, a challenge to reductive accounts of human nature by economists as a "utility-maximizing machine" as well as Marxian or communitarian "nostalgia for a world that was lost to consumer avarice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.amazon.com/Worldly-Philosopher-Odyssey-Albert-Hirschman/dp/0691155674/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1377483770&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=worldly+philosopher+the+odyssey+of+albert+o.+hirschman |title=Worldly Philosopher: The Odyssey of Albert O. Hirschman |first=Jeremy |last=Adelman |authorlink=Jeremy Adelman |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=April 7, 2013 |isbn= 978-0691155678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Herfindahl-Hirschman Index==
In 1945, Hirschman proposed a market concentration index which was the square root of the sum of the squares of the market share of each participant in the market.&lt;ref name="Hirschman1980"/&gt; [[Orris C. Herfindahl]] proposed a similar index (but without the square root) in 1950, apparently unaware of the prior work.&lt;ref name="Herfindahl1950"/&gt; Thus, it is usually referred to as the [[Herfindahl index|Herfindahl-Hirschman index]].

:''In vernacular British English and Irish English, "The Antipodes" is sometimes used to refer to Australia and New Zealand, and "Antipodeans" to their inhabitants (see [[Antipodes]])''.
The '''Antipodeans''' were a group of [[Australian]] modern artists who asserted the importance of [[figurative art]], and protested against [[abstract expressionism]]. They staged a single exhibition in Melbourne during August 1959. &lt;!--to which Fred Williams was excluded/does this make any sense?/--&gt;

==History==

The Antipodeans group consisted of seven modern painters and the art historian [[Bernard William Smith|Bernard Smith]], who compiled ''The Antipodean Manifesto'',&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Smith: ''The Antipodean Manifesto: Essays in Art and History''. Oxford University Press, Melbourne, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; a declaration fashioned from the artists' comments as a catalogue essay to accompany their exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nga.gov.au/exhibitions/antipodeans/index.htm|title=Antipodeans: Challenge and Response in Australian Art|last=Australia|first=National Gallery of|website=nga.gov.au|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artists were [[Charles Blackman]], [[Arthur Boyd]], [[David Boyd (artist)|David Boyd]], [[John Brack]], [[Robert Dickerson]], [[John Perceval]] and [[Clifton Pugh]]. Only Dickerson, from [[Sydney]], was not [[Melbourne]]-based of this group. In 1959 none were direct members of the [[Heide Circle]] that had maintained its importance with the Melbourne Branch of the Contemporary Art Society (CAS) since the early 1940s. Three were [[Boyd family]] members and all were fraternal painters of some stature working within their maintained styles of realistic imagery. Notably, they did not exhibit in the CAS's own gallery, as the society opposed the show, but chose instead to use the premises of the rival [[Victorian Artists Society|Victorian Artists' Society]], long a bastion for cultural conservatism in Melbourne.

The ''Antipodean Manifesto'' was a reaction to the considerable public success of the museum exhibition, ''The New American Painting'', an authoritative survey of abstract expressionism organised by New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]], which was touring Europe over 1958–59. The Australian painters feared that American abstraction was becoming the new orthodoxy, and that intolerance towards the modernist figurative art they practiced was increasing internationally.

Their manifesto therefore warned against the uncritical adoption by artists of overseas fashion, American abstract expressionism in particular. The manifesto took its central stand on the cardinal importance of the image:
{{cquote|[T]he image, the recognisable shape, the meaningful symbol, is the basic unit of [the artist's] language... It is born of past experience and refers back to past experience — and it communicates. It communicates because it has the capacity to refer to experiences that the artist shares with his audience.}}

The manifesto was seen by some local artists and critics at the time as a statement in favour of conservatism and reaction, and as a call to isolate Australia from international art. Their case was not helped by the fact that they were all enjoying some commercial success, as against their immediate rivals (the local abstractionists [[Roger Kemp]], [[Leonard French]], [[Inge King]] and [[George Johnson (artist)|George Johnson]]) who were struggling. Some members resigned from the Antipodeans group during the exhibition, and have viewed their participation in it with embarrassment ever since.{{fact|date=June 2014}}

Nevertheless, with the assistance of British museum director [[Kenneth Clark]], works by group members were included in a 1961 exhibition entitled ''Recent Australian Painting'' at the [[Whitechapel Art Gallery|Whitechapel Gallery]] in London (alongside that of [[Jon Molvig]], [[Albert Tucker (artist)|Albert Tucker]], [[Sidney Nolan]], [[Fred Williams (artist)|Fred Williams]] and others). They felt vindicated by their inclusion in this exhibition, which established that contemporary Australian painting had a well-founded national identity. In the months after the Antipodeans exhibition, Boyd, Perceval and Blackman all moved to London, and established successful exhibiting careers on the European scene.

In 1961 a group calling themselves ''[[Sydney 9]]'' — which included the Australian abstract artists Hector Gilliland, [[Carl Plate]], Leonard Hessing, [[Stanislav Rapotec|Stan Rapotec]], [[John Olsen (Australian artist)|John Olsen]], [[Robert Klippel]], [[Clement Meadmore]] and Bill Rose — held an exhibition of paintings and sculpture to counter the Antipodeans group. The group also recruited a young critic, [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], to oppose the stance of Bernard Smith.

In 1999 the now internationally known art movement [[Stuckism]] was founded, which among other preceding art movements draws on the principles of The Antipodeans.

'''Bilingual Review Press''' is an American [[publishing house]] specialising in the [[publishing|publication]] of scholarly and literary works by [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic and Latino American]] authors and researchers. It was founded in 1973 as the publisher of ''[[The Bilingual Review|The Bilingual Review/La revista bilingüe]]'', a new academic and literary [[academic journal|journal]] with a focus on Spanish-English [[bilingualism]], bilingual studies and Hispanic literature that was first issued in 1974. Under the [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] name '''Bilingual Press/Editorial Bilingüe''' the press also publishes and distributes [[book]] titles by or about Hispanic and [[Latin America]]n authors, covering literary [[fiction]], poetry as well as [[non-fiction]] titles relating to [[Chicano]] and [[Latin American studies]]. Bilingual Press publishes from 8 to 10 titles annually, with an accumulated back catalogue of more than 150 titles under the imprint in both English and Spanish as well as some bilingual editions.&lt;ref name="NACCS 2006"&gt;NACCS (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher is also a distributor of related titles from other presses, {{as of|2008|lc=yes}} numbering over a thousand releases.

Bilingual Review Press is based in [[Tempe, Arizona]], at [[Arizona State University]]. It operates as an autonomous sub-entity of the University's [[Hispanic Research Center]], which provides support services to the publishing enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; The press is maintained through a number of federal and private funding grants, including the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], as well as returns on its publication sales.&lt;ref&gt;Hernández-G. (2006).

The director and general editor since its foundation is [[Gary D. Keller]].&lt;ref name="NACCS 2006" /&gt;

The company was established in 1973 as a publishing entity for ''The Bilingual Review/La revista bilingüe'', a journal on Hispanic American studies and literature founded by Keller with support from scholarly grants. It was initially based out of the Department of Romance Languages at [[City College of New York]]. In 1975 it moved operations to [[York College, City University of New York|York College]] and then later to the [[State University of New York]] at [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]]. Since 1986, the Bilingual Review Press has been based on campus at Arizona State, following Keller's transfer to take up a position at the newly formed Hispanic Research Center.&lt;ref&gt;Hernández-G. (2006), NACCS (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bilingual Review Press has published novels, poetry and essay contributions from both upcoming and established Hispanic and Latin American authors, including [[Virgil Suárez]], [[Rafael C. Castillo]], [[Alfred Arteaga]], [[Sandra Cisneros]], [[Daniel Olivas]], and [[Rolando Hinojosa]]. Through both its own imprints and distribution of works first issued from other presses, it has also kept in circulation previous works of classic [[Latin American literature]], reissuing lapsed or out-of-print titles by literary luminaries such as [[Carlos Fuentes]], [[Isabel Allende]], and [[Jorge Luis Borges]].&lt;ref&gt;Hernández-G. (2006).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4952">The '''Birecik Dam Cemetery''' is an Early Bronze Age cemetery in the [[Gaziantep]] region in [[southeastern Turkey]]. This cemetery was used extensively for a very short period of time at the beginning of the third millennium BC.
[[File:Birecik dam-GAP.jpg|thumbnail|Picture of the Birecik Dam]]

== Location and site description ==

This three hectare cemetery is located several hundred meters from the [[Birecik Dam]] on the [[Euphrates River]] and is approximately 25 kilometers north of the ancient site of [[Carchemish]]. More than 300 graves were dug into the subsurface clay bed between 3100-2600 BC, and despite the large size of this cemetery no attached settlement has been found.&lt;ref name="sertok"&gt;Sertok, K. and Ergeç, R. 1999. A New Early Bronze Age Cemetery: Excavation near the Birecik Dam, Southeastern Turkey. Preliminary Report (1997-98) ''Anatolica'' 25: 87-107&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary of Excavation ==

The Birecik Dam Cemetery was discovered during the building of the Birecik Dam as part of the [[GAP project]], and it was subsequently excavated during two field seasons in 1997 and 1998 by archaeologists associated with the Gaziantep Museum. 312 burials were excavated in a 300 x 200 meter area during this time, though it is thought that many more graves were destroyed by the clay mining prior to the official excavations.&lt;ref name="sertok" /&gt; The burials that were excavated consisted predominantly of [[Cist|cist graves]], though there were also a small number of cooking pot and storage [[jar burials]]. The cist burials were oriented NW-SW and most had similar dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Birecik Dam Cemetery, The Archaeological Settlements of Turkey- TAY Project [http://www.tayproject.org/TAYages.fm$Retrieve?CagNo=441&amp;html=ages_detail_e.html&amp;layout=web]&lt;/ref&gt; Between the graves were a number of shallow depressions and pits that were filled with various materials (such as food remains) that are thought to have been part of the burial ceremony.&lt;ref name= "SandE"&gt;Sertok, K. and Ergeç, R. 2000.

Peltenburg). Oxford: Oxbow, pp. 198-213&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artifacts ==

Burials in this cemetery frequently included grave goods. These items consisted of: ceramic vessels, metal objects, frit and talc beads, several examples of terracotta figurines, two [[cylinder seals]] made of limestone and carnelian, a flint blade and fifteen painted cups in the Ninevite 5 style of northeastern Syria. Ceramics were by far the most frequently item found in these burials with over 5,000 vessels found between the 312 excavated burials, and an individual tomb could contain up to 150 vessels.&lt;ref name="sertok" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Euph" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Squadrone, F.F. 2000. Metals for the Dead. Metal Finds from the Birecik Dam Early Bronze Age Cemetery in the Middle Euphrates Area, near Carchemish (Turkey). In ''Proceedings of the First International Congress on the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East''. Rome, May 18th-23rd 1998, Vol II (eds. P. Matthiae, A. Enea, L. Peyronel and F. Pinnock). Roma: Dipartimento di Scienze Storiche, Archaeologiche e Antropologiche Dell ‘Antichita, pp. 1541-1556&lt;/ref&gt; Due to damp soil conditions and the leaching of salt through the soil, the human remains were in very poor condition when compared to the ceramic, stone and metal objects &lt;ref name="sertok" /&gt;

In these burials, numerous similarities have been found with those at the contemporary site of [[Arslantepe]], also in Turkey, to the northeast of Birecik.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The similarities are not restricted purely to the structure, but also the type of furnishings in which metal objects predominate, especially numerous weapons and spearheads. One striking aspect, which is wholly similar to Arslantepe, is the way in which the metal spearheads are arranged, generally along the northern and southern sides of the tomb, but always along the internal sides of the cist.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Church of Zion, Jerusalem''', also known as the '''Church of the Apostles on Mount Zion''', refers to the remains of a Roman-era church or [[synagogue]] on [[Mount Zion]] in [[Jerusalem]] that some historians speculate may have belonged to an early [[Jewish-Christian]] congregation.

==History==
The remains of the church or synagogue date back to the 2nd-5th century, when Jerusalem was renamed [[Aelia Capitolina]] by the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Günter Stemberger ''Jews and Christians in the Holy Land: Palestine in the fourth century'' Page 79  - 2000 "A further attempt to locate Jewish Christians in Jerusalem is connected with the Church of Zion. The arguments that have been advanced to date for the idea that in Jerusalem a Gentile Christian congregation, the majority, had its home at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, while a Jewish Christian congregation centred on Mount Zion,."&lt;/ref&gt; The reference to such a congregation is from the [[Bordeaux Pilgrim]] (c.333), [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (348) and [[Eucherius of Lyon]] (440), but in academia the theory originates with [[Bellarmino Bagatti]] (1976), who considered that a [[Jewish Christian]] synagogue existed in the old "[[Essenes#Location|Essene Quarter]]".&lt;ref&gt;Studia Hierosolymitana in onore del P. Bellarmino Bagatti: Volume 1 Bellarmino Bagatti, Emmanuele Testa, Ignazio Mancini - 1976 However, not the biblical Mount Zion, but rather the "Christian" Mount Zion will be explored in this study. ... B. Bagatti and others think that the "synagogue" referred to must have been a Judéo-Christian one, which again must have:&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1951,  archaeologist [[Jacob Pinkerfield|Jacob Pinkerfeld]] discovered the remains of a synagogue on Mount Zion which, he concluded, had later been used as a Jewish-Christian church.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth McNamer, Bargil Pixner ''Jesus and First-Century Christianity in Jerusalem'' p6 8, 2008 "In 1951, archaeologist Joseph [sic] Pinkerfield found on Mount Zion the remains of a synagogue and concluded that the building had ... Pinkerfield also found pieces of plaster with graffiti scratched on them that came from the synagogue wall. "&lt;/ref&gt; Emmanuel Testa's support for Bagatti's view led to the "Bagatti-Testa school" which believes that a surviving Jewish-Christian community existed in Jerusalem, and that many Jewish-Christians returned to Jerusalem after the wars and established themselves on Mount Zion.&lt;ref&gt;Joan E. Taylor Christians and the holy places: the myth of Jewish-Christian origins  1993 p1 "According to the Bagatti-Testa school, the Jewish-Christian church was centred in Jerusalem and headed first by Peter ... Many Jewish-Christians then returned to Jerusalem after the war ended and established themselves on Mount Zion."&lt;/ref&gt; Bagatti's theory is supported by [[Bargil Pixner]] (May 1990 ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]''&lt;ref&gt;Pixner [http://www.centuryone.org/apostles.html BAR article, May 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;) who argues that the 6th-century [[Madaba Map]] shows two churches - the [[Hagia Maria Sion Abbey|Basilica of Hagia Sion]] and the "Church of the Apostles," the putative Jewish-Christian synagogue of [[Mount Zion]].&lt;ref&gt;James R. Davila The Dead Sea scrolls as background to postbiblical Judaism and ...2003 p66 "Channels of Communication: Essenes in Jerusalem? In a long series of publications since 1976 the Dominican archaeologist Bargil Pixner has been arguing the case for an Essene quarter in Jerusalem located on the southern part of the ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem with the thesis of Bagatti, Testa, Pinkerfeld and Pixner is that the layers indicate a Crusader structure built on top of Roman layers.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin K. Broadhead ''Jewish Ways of Following Jesus: Redrawing the Religious Map of ... '' 2010 p 320 "Finally, Pixner claims that the Madaba map (6th century) indicates that the Byzantine Hagia Sion was built alongside the Church of the Apostles, not over it. A key problem in the theory of Bagatti, Testa, Pinkerfeld, and Pixner is the sequence of layers. If the walls identified by Pinkerfeld are Roman era, one is left with a Crusader structure built directly on top of Roman walls."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dhokra''' ({{lang-or|ଡୋକରା}}, {{lang-bn|ডোকরা}}) (also spelt Dokra) is non&amp;ndash;ferrous metal casting using the [[lost-wax casting]] technique. This sort of metal casting has been used in [[India]] for over 4,000 years and is still used. One of the earliest known lost wax artefacts is the dancing girl of [[Mohenjo-daro]].&lt;ref name=missouri&gt;{{cite web|url =http://anthromuseum.missouri.edu/minigalleries/lostwax/intro.shtml |title = Metal Working in India - Lost Wax Casting |accessdate = 2009-02-08|last = Della Cava  |first = Chiara |work = |publisher = Museum of Anthropology, University of Missouri-Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The product of dhokra artisans are in great demand in domestic and foreign markets because of primitive simplicity, enchanting folk motifs and forceful form. Dhokra horses, elephants, peacocks, owls, religious images, measuring bowls, and lamp caskets etc., are highly appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.infobanc.com/dokra.htm|title =Dokra|accessdate =2009-02-08|last =|first =|work =|publisher =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090130100223/http://infobanc.com/dokra.htm|archivedate =2009-01-30|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lost wax technique for casting of copper based alloys has also been found in [[China]], [[Egypt]], [[Malaysia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Central America]], and other places.

==The process==
There are two main processes of lost wax casting: solid casting and hollow casting. While the former is predominant in the [[South India|south of India]] the latter is more common in Central and [[East India|Eastern India]]. Solid casting does not use a clay [[core (manufacturing)|core]] but instead a solid piece of wax to create the mould; hollow casting is the more traditional method and uses the clay core.&lt;ref name=missouri/&gt;

The first task in the lost wax hollow casting process consists of developing a clay core which is roughly the shape of the final cast image. Next, the clay core is covered by a layer of wax composed of pure [[beeswax]], [[resin]] from the tree ''Damara orientalis'', and [[List of vegetable oils#Nut oils|nut oil]]. The wax is then shaped and carved in all its finer details of design and decorations. It is then covered with layers of clay, which takes the negative form of the wax on the inside, thus becoming a mould for the metal that will be poured inside it. Drain ducts are left for the wax, which melts away when the clay is cooked. The wax is then replaced by the molten metal, often using brass scrap as basic raw material. The liquid metal poured in hardens between the core and the inner surface of the mould. The metal fills the mould and takes the same shape as the wax. The outer layer of clay is then chipped off and the metal icon is polished and finished as desired.&lt;ref name=missouri/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.india9.com/i9show/Dhokra-Craft-52343.htm |title = Dhokra craft |accessdate = 2009-03-12|last =   |first =    |work = |publisher =india9.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The name==
Dhokra Damar tribes are the traditional [[metalsmith]]s of [[West Bengal]] and [[Odisha]]. Their technique of lost wax casting is named after their tribe, hence Dhokra metal casting. The tribe extends from [[Jharkhand]] to West Bengal and [[Odisha|Orissa]]; members are distant cousins of the [[Chhattisgarh]] Dhokras. A few hundred years ago, the Dhokras of Central and Eastern India traveled south as far as [[Kerala]] and north as far as [[Rajasthan]] and hence are now found [[List of regions of India|all over India]]. Dhokra, or Dokra, craft from around [[Santiniketan]], West Bengal, is popular. Recently [[Adilabad]] [[Dokra]] from [[Telangana]] got Geographical Indicator tag in 2018.

==Dhokra,The Art &amp; Jewellery==
When mixed in the right proportion, this art form gives an antique look and augments well with various contemporary styles. A little different from its distant cousins of the east, it embodies a more primitive simplicity.

Some &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tribesindia.com/dhokra-art/ Dokra ornaments]&lt;/ref&gt; are crafted by Bhottada section of the famous Gond tribes of Orissa, well known for their costumes and embellishment styles. Originally, seeds of different wild fruits in the forest were used as beads with cotton thread in their necklace and earrings which over the years have been substituted by beads made from brass by the heating and beating process. By and large, Bhottada women of affluent families having a special status in their community used this jewellery. In recent times, it symbolises a more utilitarian approach in a traditional framework.

'''EducationUSA''' is a U.S. Department of State network of over [http://educationusa.state.gov/find-advising-center/ 400 international student advising centers] in more than 170 countries. EducationUSA is officially a branch in the Office of Global Educational Programs in the [http://exchanges.state.gov/ Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA)]. ECA fosters mutual understanding between the [[United States]] and other countries by promoting personal, professional, and institutional ties between private citizens and organizations in the [[United States]] and abroad, as well as by presenting U.S. history, society, art and culture in all of its [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] to overseas audiences.

The EducationUSA network promotes U.S. higher education to millions of students around the world by offering accurate, comprehensive, and current information about opportunities to study at accredited postsecondary institutions in the United States. EducationUSA also provides services to the U.S. higher education community to help institutional leaders meet their recruitment and campus internationalization goals. [http://educationusa.state.gov/find-advising-center/ EducationUSA centers] are located in U.S. embassies and consulates, American Spaces, Fulbright commissions, bi-national centers, universities, and non-profit organizations

'''EducationUSA launched a new website in March 2015''' - [http://educationusa.state.gov/ '''educationusa.state.gov''']

==Services==

'''[http://www.educationusa.state.gov/your-5-steps-us-study/ EducationUSA Serves International Students]'''
Each year, EducationUSA advisers respond to millions of inquiries from international students. Advisers offer a wide range of in-person and virtual services to students and their families based on Your 5 Steps to U.S. Study, a guide to navigating the U.S. higher education application process. Advisers provide information on a host of topics, including:

* The admissions process and standardized testing requirements
* How to finance a U.S. education
* The student visa process 
* Preparing for departure to the United States


[http://educationusa.state.gov/us-higher-education-professionals/ '''EducationUSA Serves the U.S. Higher Education Community'''] EducationUSA advisers support accredited U.S. institutions’ international student recruitment and internationalization efforts by:

* Organizing school visits and college fairs, virtual and on location
* Sharing information about foreign educational systems and scholarship programs
* Connecting U.S. and foreign educational institutions

==Programs==

EducationUSA's main program is advising [http://www.educationusa.state.gov/your-5-steps-us-study/ international students] on U.S. higher education opportunities. This is done through [http://www.educationusa.state.gov/your-5-steps-us-study/ 'Your 5 Steps to U.S. Study']. However, the network also focuses on assisting [http://educationusa.state.gov/us-higher-education-professionals/ U.S. higher education representatives] to connect with students and is increasingly working to engage more with [http://educationusa.state.gov/foreign-institutions-and-governments/ foreign institutions and governments]. Roughly half a million international students enroll in a U.S. institution of higher learning last year. Many seek advice from a regional EducationUSA adviser before, during, and after the application process. Roughly 500+ Advisers are located in advising centers located in 170 countries. Advisers reach out to students, professors, local institutions, and other groups and individuals through individual advising, admissions visits, college fairs, and virtual consulting.


The [http://educationusa.state.gov/us-higher-education-professionals/recruitment-resources/student-mobility-data/ Open Doors Report], published through the [[Institute of International Education]], is an annual census of international students in the U.S. and U.S. students abroad. EducationUSA funds this and other research on study abroad.


'''Opportunity Funds Program'''
The EducationUSA Opportunity Funds program assists highly qualified students who are likely to be awarded full financial aid from U.S. colleges and universities, but lack the financial resources to cover the up-front costs to apply, such as testing, application fees, or airfare.

Each Opportunity Funds student undergoes a selective process of evaluation by an EducationUSA adviser, Regional Educational Advising Coordinator (REAC), and the Public Affairs Section of a U.S. Embassy/Consulate. In addition to academic abilities, Opportunity Funds students bring cultural and socio-economic diversity to U.S. campuses. More than 100 colleges and universities have enrolled Opportunity Funds students since 2006.

The Opportunity Funds program is currently available at EducationUSA advising centers in 

* Asia: Bangladesh, Cambodia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka,Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Vietnam
* Europe: Belarus, Bosnia, Russia, Serbia, Ukraine
* Latin America: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Venezuela
* Middle East and North Africa: Egypt, Lebanon
* Sub-Saharan Africa: Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe


'''EducationUSA Leadership Institute'''
[http://www.iie.org/programs/educationusa-leadership-institutes/ The EducationUSA Leadership Institutes] bring participants from select countries and world regions to the United States to increase their understanding of U.S. higher education, develop the tools necessary to build capacity within their own systems, and engage with the U.S. higher education sector in effective, sustained ways. Groups of Ministry of Education or other government officials, college and university administrators, and other qualified participants will participate in Leadership Institutes focusing on a range of timely and critical topics.


'''MOOC Camp'''
[http://eca.state.gov/programs-initiatives/mooc-camp/ MOOC Camps] are facilitated discussions around massive open online courses (MOOCs), Open Courseware, and other free online courses. They are hosted at U.S. embassies, consulates, American Spaces, and in other public venues around the world. Facilitated discussions are led by alumni who have participated in U.S. government exchange programs, such as the Fulbright program, and/or by U.S. embassy/consulate staff who are familiar with the course materials and volunteer their time. U.S. embassies and consulates in more than 60 countries are currently participating in MOOC Camps with subjects ranging from entrepreneurship and college writing to science and technology. Course content is drawn from major MOOC providers, including Coursera, EdX, and Udacity as well as from multiple Open CourseWare providers.


'''EducationUSA Training Institutes'''
EducationUSA facilitates several training institutes in the United States for EducationUSA advisers. Each two-week EducationUSA Training Institute comprises a Washington, D.C.-based workshop, with sessions at the U.S. Department of State, and campus-based training. The campus-based training week offers a unique opportunity for U.S. institutions to bring a group of EducationUSA advisers directly to their campuses. 


'''Competitive College Clubs'''
EducationUSA Competitive College Clubs (CCC) are cohort-based advising programs that help the best and brightest students apply to competitive U.S. colleges and universities. CCC advisers work intensively to prepare students for the application process. CCCs are open to students in grades 8-11 who are in the top 10% of their class.

CCC advisers organize student activities, including study groups, intensive SAT and ACT preparation, reading assignments, lectures, and community service projects. Students sign a contract detailing their responsibilities, which include attending all meetings during the school year and summer sessions.

While there are no guarantees that a CCC student will be accepted to a U.S. college or university, this intensive group advising provides extra support for motivated, high-performing students. Some CCC students also qualify for the Opportunity Funds program. EducationUSA advisers also work with CCC students to develop an alternative education plan in case studying in the United States does not work out for them.


'''U.S. Student Achievers Program (USAP)'''
The EducationUSA Advising Center in Harare, Zimbabwe founded the [[United States Student Achievers Program]] (USAP) in 1999. USAP helps youth negotiate the intricate admission and financial aid processes at selective institutions in the United States, while also creating strong cohorts that offer mutual support throughout and beyond the admission process. Run by EducationUSA advisers, USAP has expanded to several countries since 2005. Some USAP students also qualify for the Opportunity Funds program.

USAP participants all have the following four characteristics: academic excellence, demonstrated leadership potential, an ethos of giving back to community, and economic disadvantage.


'''NeXXt Scholars Initiative'''
The NeXXt Scholars Initiative seeks to engage and advance young women from around the world in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers by preparing the next generation of leaders in science, engineering, and innovation. By partnering with 38 U.S. women's colleges, NeXXt expands opportunities for young women from 47 countries/territories with Muslim-majority populations to obtain a world-class undergraduate STEM education in the United States alongside American students.

To learn more about the NeXXt Scholars Program, please email nexxtscholars@state.gov or visit the [https://www.state.gov/e/stas/202507.htm/ program website].

'''Fatimid art''' refers to Islamic artifacts and architecture from the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] (909-1171), principally in [[Egypt]] and [[North Africa]]. The Fatimid Caliphate was initially established in the [[Maghreb]], with its roots in a ninth-century [[Shia]] [[Ismailism|Ismailist]] religious movement originating in [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]].  Many monuments survive in the Fatimid cities founded in North Africa, starting with [[Mahdia]], on the [[Tunisia]]n coast, the principal city prior to the conquest of Egypt in 969 and the building of  ''al-Qahira'', the "City Victorious", now part of modern-day [[Cairo]]. The period was marked by a prosperity amongst the upper echelons, manifested in the creation of opulent and finely wrought objects in the decorative arts, including carved [[rock crystal]], [[lustreware]] and other [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[wood carving|wood]] and [[ivory carving]], [[gold jewelry]] and other [[metalware]], textiles, books and coinage.  These items not only reflected personal wealth, but were used as gifts to curry favour abroad. The most precious and valuable objects were amassed in the caliphal palaces in al-Qahira. In the 1060s, following several years of drought during which the armies received no payment, the palaces were systematically looted, the libraries largely destroyed, precious gold objects melted down, with a few of the treasures dispersed across the medieval Christian world. Afterwards Fatimid artifacts continued to be made in the same style, but were adapted to a larger populace using less precious materials. 
{{cquote|In 1067-68 the great treasury of the Fatimids was ransacked when the troops rebelled and demanded to be paid. The stories of this plundering mention not only great quantities of pearls and jewels, crowns, swords, and other imperial accoutrements but also many objects in rare materials and of enormous size. Eighteen thousand pieces of rock crystal and cut glass were swiftly looted from the palace, and twice as many jewelled objects; also large numbers of gold and silver knives all richly set with jewels; valuable chess and backgammon pieces; various types of hand mirrors, skilfully decorated; six thousand perfume bottles in gilded silver; and so on. More specifically, we learn of enormous pieces of rock crystal inscribed with caliphal names; of gold animals encrusted with jewels and enamels; of a large golden palm tree; and even of a whole garden partially gilded and decorated with niello.  There was also an immensely rich treasury of furniture, carpets, curtains, and wall coverings, many embroidered in gold, often with designs incorporating birds and quadrupeds, kings and their notables, and even a whole range of geographical vistas.Relatively few of these objects have survived, most of them very small; but the finest are impressive enough to lend substance to the vivid picture painted in the historical accounts of this vanished world of luxury. |4={{harvtxt|Ettinghausen|Grabar|Jenkins|2001}}}}

==Rock crystal ewers==
Rock crystal ewers are pitchers carved from a single block of [[Quartz|rock crystal]]. They were made by Islamic [[Fatimid]] artisans and are considered to be amongst the rarest objects in [[Islamic art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://simerg.com/literary-readings/literary-reading-fatimid-rock-crystal-ewers-most-valuable-objects-in-islamic-art/ Fatimid Rock Crystal Ewers, Most Valuable Objects in Islamic Art]&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few that survived and are now in collections across Europe. They are often in cathedral treasuries, where they were rededicated after being captured from their original Islamic settings. Made in Egypt in the late 10th century, the ewer pictured is exquisitely decorated with fantastic birds, beasts and twisting tendrils. The Treasure of Caliph Mostansir-Billah at [[Cairo]], which was destroyed in 1062, apparently contained 1800 rock crystal vessels.

Great skill was required to hollow out the raw rock crystal without breaking it and to carve the delicate, often very shallow, decoration.

==Fatimid architecture==
{{main article|Fatimid architecture}}
In architecture, the [[Fatimid]]s followed [[Tulunid]] techniques and used similar materials, but also developed those of their own. In [[Cairo]], their first congregational mosque was [[al-Azhar mosque]] ("the splendid") founded along with the city (969–973), which, together with its adjacent institution of higher learning ([[al-Azhar University]]), became the spiritual center for [[Ismaili|Ismaili Shia]]. The Mosque of al-Hakim (r. 996–1013), an important example of Fatimid architecture and architectural decoration, played a critical role in [[Fatimid]] ceremonial and procession, which emphasized the religious and political role of the [[Fatimid]] [[caliph]]. Besides elaborate funerary monuments, other surviving Fatimid structures include the [[Aqmar Mosque]] (1125)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=INsmT6zjAl8C&amp;pg=PA72 Doris Behrens-Abouseif (1992), ''Islamic Architecture in Cairo: An Introduction'', BRILL, p. 72]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the monumental gates for Cairo's [[Defensive wall|city walls]] commissioned by the powerful [[Fatimid]] [[emir]] and [[vizier]] [[Badr al-Jamali]] (r. 1073–1094).

The '''Fountain of Neptune''' ({{lang-it|Fontana di Nettuno}}) is a monumental civic [[fountain]] located in the eponymous square, ''Piazza del Nettuno'', next to [[Piazza Maggiore]], in [[Bologna]], [[Italy]]&lt;ref&gt;The urbanistic history and quasi-political character of these interrelated civic spaces and structures expressing conflicting connotations of papal and communal-republican instruments of government are discussed in Naomi Miller, ''Renaissance Bologna: A Study in Architectural Form and Content'' (University of Kansas) 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Its bronze figure of ''[[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]'', extending his reach in a lordly gesture of stilling and controlling the waters, is an early work by [[Giambologna]], completed about 1567.&lt;ref&gt;Date in Charles Avery, ''Giambologna'' (1987); a description of the fountain appears in the second edition (1568) of [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''Vite''; a collection of essays on the conservation undertaken in the 1980s on the Neptune fountain, ''Il Nettuno del Giambologna: storia e restauro'' (Milan) 1989, contains an essay by Richard Tittle on the contracts for it, of 1563, and one by Giancarlo Roversi on its impact on public life in Bologna and changing attitudes towards its display of nudity.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1054 - Bologna - Fontana del Nettuno - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 9-Feb-2008.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Detail with a lactating nereid.]]
An innovation of Giambologna's fountain designs is the fantastic and non-geometrical forms he gave to the basins into which water splashed and flowed, "curiously folded, bulging and elastic in form", as Rosalind Grippi remarked.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Grippi, "A Sixteenth Century Bozzetto" ''The Art Bulletin'' '''38'''.3 (September 1956:143-147) p. 146; the ''[[bozzetto]]'' Grippi was discussing was not related to the fountain.&lt;/ref&gt; The fountain is a model example of [[Mannerism|Mannerist taste]] of the courtly elite in the mid-sixteenth century: construction of the statue was commissioned by the [[Cardinal Legate]] of the city, [[Charles Borromeo]], to symbolize the fortunate recent election of Borromeo's uncle as [[Pope Pius IV]].

The work was designed by the [[Palermo|Palermitan]] architect [[Tommaso Laureti]] in 1563, with an over-lifesize bronze of the god Neptune on the top, executed by [[Giambologna]], who had submitted a model for the fountain of Neptune in [[Florence]], but had lost the commission to [[Baccio Bandinelli]]. Before the fountain was built, an entire edifice was demolished to make space for it. The fountain was completed in 1565,&lt;ref&gt;Documents in the State Archives in Bologna were used by W. Gramberg, ''Giambologna, eine Untersuchung über seine Wanderjähre'' (Berlin) 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Neptune'' was fixed in place within a couple of years.

The logo of the [[Maserati]] car company is based on the trident in this Neptune statue. In 1920 one of the Maserati brothers, the artist Mario Maserati, used this symbol in the logo at the suggestion of family friend Marquis Diego de Sterlich. It was considered particularly appropriate for the sports car company due to fact that Neptune represents strength and vigor; additionally the statue is a characteristic symbol of the company's original home city.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maserati100.com/history/timeline.html&lt;/ref&gt;

2 January 2017 the Neptune has appeared in many newspapers to be censored from Facebook. The social network blocked a photo of the statue after estimating it violated its guidelines by being too sexually explicit. Facebook later recognized its mistake, saying in a statement it sometimes incorrectly prohibit ads.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4084926/Facebook-blocks-Fountain-Neptune-photo-Bologna-page.html&lt;/ref&gt; This story inspired the social game GuessTheGiant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guessthegiant.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Neptune Fountain has its base on three steps, on which it is situated a tank made of the local boulder and covered by marble of Verona. In the centre of the tank, there is a base where there are four Nereids who are touching their breasts. The base is decorated by pontifical emblems, ornaments that - connected to four cherubs - hold dolphins (referred to the Ganges, the Nile, the Amazon River, and the Danube, so the four parts of the world that were in that moment known).
In the centre of this base raises the majestic figure of the Neptune, a product of Giambologna’s chisel, who realized one of the most typical expressions of the manneristic theatricality.

The Neptune, who is stretching his right hand right up to the sky, almost as if he wanted to placate the waves, is a symbol of the dynastic exaltation of the Pope Pio IV, becoming then the symbol of the political power of the Church in Bologna: just as the Neptune was the master of the seas, the Pope was the master of the world.
The god Neptune, in fact, resend symbolically to the power that gives wealth and fertility all around him; so the reference is to a generous but inviolable administration, with a straight and proud look for sure not directed to the people.

==Inscriptions==
On the four sides of the marble tank there are four inscriptions in Latin that want to illustrate what the fountain was built for.

	•	Fori Ornamento (to decorate the square);
	•	Aere Publico (built thanks to public money);
	•	Populi Commodo (built for the people);
	•	MDLXIIII (built in 1564; the date is wrong though, since the fountain was officially finished in 1566).

The customers names were also in-scripted:

	•	Pius IIII Pont. Max;
	•	Petrus Donatus Caesius Gubernator;
	•	Carolus Borromaeus Cardinalis;
	•	S.P.Q.B. (Senatus Populusque Bonononiensis).

==Symbolism==
The trident of the fountain inspired and it was used by Maserati brothers as emblem for their first car, the Maserati Tipo 26, then it was used as their logo. Plus the sculpture is the symbol of the Excelsa Neptuni Balla, storic order of Goliarda of Bologna.
The chief of the order, Pontifex Maximus, has a scepter that illustrate, indeed, a trident.

'''''Glokaya kuzdra''''' ({{lang-ru|Глокая куздра}}) is a reference to a [[Russian language]] phrase constructed from non-existent words in a grammatically proper way, similar to the [[English language]] phrases using the [[pseudoword]] "[[gostak]]". It was suggested by Russian [[linguist]] [[Lev Shcherba]]. The full phrase is: "Гло́кая ку́здра ште́ко будлану́ла бо́кра и курдя́чит бокрёнка" (''Glokaya kuzdra shteko budlanula bokra i kurdyachit bokryonka''). In the phrase, all [[word stem]]s (glok-, kuzdr-, shtek-, budl-, bokr-, kurd-) are meaningless, but all [[affix]]es are real, used in a grammatically correct way and — which is the point — provide enough semantics for the phrase to be a perceived description of some dramatic action with a specified plot but with unknown entities. A very rough English translation (considering no semantic information is available) could be: "The glocky kuzdra shteckly budled the bocker and kurdyaks the bockerling."

Shcherba used it in his lectures in linguistics to emphasise the importance of grammar in acquiring foreign languages. The phrase was popularized by [[Lev Uspensky]] in his [[popular science]] book ''[[A Word about Words]].''&lt;ref&gt;Uspensky, Lev ''[http://www.speakrus.ru/uspens/ A Word About Words]'', Chapter "[http://www.speakrus.ru/uspens/ch6-2.html Глокая куздра]" {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5318">A '''green card marriage''' is a  [[marriage of convenience]] between a legal resident of the United States of America and a person who would be ineligible for residency but for being married to the resident. The term derives from the availability of permanent resident documents ("[[Permanent residence (United States)|Green card]]s") for spouses of legal residents in the United States, where marriage is one of the fastest and surest ways to obtain legal residence.&lt;ref name=cis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cis.org/marriagefraud|title=Hello, I Love You, Won’t You Tell Me Your Name: Inside the Green Card Marriage Phenomenon|author=David Seminara|publisher=Center for Immigration Studies|date=November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marriages, if legitimate, entitle the spouse to live and work in the United States, as in most other countries.  In the United States, 2.3 million marriage visas were approved from 1998 through 2007, representing 25% of all green cards in 2007.  Even if the non-resident spouse was previously an [[illegal immigrant]], marriage entitles the spouse to residency, generally without the waiting time required for persons caught being in the United States illegally.&lt;ref name=cis/&gt;

==Legality==
Most marriages between residents and non-residents are undertaken properly, for reasons other than or in addition to residency status. That said, the practice of obtaining residency through marriage is illegal in the United States if the marriage itself is fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Associated Press|title=Man pleads not guilty in alleged Internet green card marriage|date=2007-12-31|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/12/31/state/n163542S96.DTL&amp;feed=rss.news}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A marriage that is solely for purposes of obtaining legal residence is considered a sham, and is a crime in the United States for both participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Los Angeles Times|title=Pair arrested in green card marriage that resulted from Web ads|url=http://www.latimes.com/technology/la-me-craigslist7dec07,1,68047.story|author= Scott Glover|date=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2008 study by the [[Center for Immigration Studies]] cited consular officials who estimated that between 5% and 30% of all marriages between American residents and foreign nationals were fraudulent, but that very few of these marriages were detected or acted upon.&lt;ref name=cis/&gt;

Many of the arrangements are simple transactions between two individuals, often in exchange for money paid to the legal resident.  In other cases the legal resident is an unwitting victim of a fraudulent marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62616735.html|title=For love or a green card? As tougher INS laws loom: Minnesotan tells her story|publisher=Minneapolis Star-Tribune|author=Greg Gordon|date=1997-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In yet other cases the marriages are arranged by criminal enterprises, sometimes involving the complicity of corrupt immigration officials who accept payment for describing the marriage as legitimate in immigration paperwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Daily news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2006/06/08/2006-06-08_immig_officer___sis_held_in_.html|date=2006-06-08|title=Immig officer &amp; sis held in scam|author=Bill Hutchinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5609">'''Gynocriticism''' or '''gynocritics''' is the term coined in the seventies by [[Elaine Showalter]] to describe a new [[literary criticism|literary project]] intended to construct "a female framework for the analysis of women's literature".

By expanding the historical study of [[women writers]] as a distinct literary tradition, gynocritics sought to develop new models based on the study of female experience to replace male models of literary creation, and so "map the territory"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. Childers ed., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; left unexplored in earlier literary criticisms.

==History==

While previous figures like [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] had already begun to review and evaluate the female image in literature,&lt;ref name="Barry"/&gt; and [[second-wave feminism]] had explored [[phallocentrism]] and [[sexism]] through a female reading of male authors, gynocriticism was designed as a "second phase" in feminist criticism – turning to a focus on, and interrogation of female authorship, images, the feminine experience and ideology, and the history and development of the female literary tradition.&lt;ref name="Xu"&gt;Xu, Y 2007, 'Contribution of gynocriticism to feminist criticism', US – China Foreign Language, vol. 5, no. 5, pp. 1 – 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;Barry, P 2009, Beginning theory; An introduction to literary and cultural theory, Manchester University Press, Manchester.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development as a literary critique ==

Gynocriticism also examines the female struggle for identity and the social construct of gender.&lt;ref name="Barry"/&gt;  According to Elaine Showalter,&lt;ref name="Barry"/&gt; gynocritics is the study of not only the female as a gender status but also the 'internalized consciousness' of the female. The uncovering of the female [[subculture]] and exposition of a female model is the intention of gynocriticism,&lt;ref name="Xu"/&gt; comprising recognition of a distinct female [[canon (basic principle)|canon]] where a female identity is sought free from the [[masculine]] definitions and oppositions.&lt;ref name="Xu"/&gt;

Gynocriticism accordingly challenged a Freudian psychoanalytic perspective whereby the female inherently suffers envy of men and feelings of inadequacy and injustice,&lt;ref name="Xu"/&gt; combined with feelings of intellectual inferiority.&lt;ref name="Frager"&gt;Frager, R &amp; Fadiman, J 2005, Personality and personal growth 6th ed, Pearson Prentice Hall, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguing that male 'phallic prejudice'&lt;ref name="Xu"/&gt; itself creates a female consciousness that demands a critique,&lt;ref name="Xu"/&gt; and that prejudice against the female incites a specific noesis that gets attributed to the female,&lt;ref name="Frager"/&gt; Gynocriticism stressed that this prejudice has concealed the female literary tradition to the point of imitating the masculine.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;Friedman, Susan Stanford. Mappings : Feminism and the Cultural Geographies of Encounter. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements and limitations==
Gynocriticism helped reclaim from obscurity a vast body of early female writings, often published in [[Virago]],&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Waugh, ''Literary Theory and Criticism'' (2006) p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; as well as producing such feminist classics as ''[[The Madwoman in the Attic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers ed., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; However its very successes left it open to new challenges from within feminism. Poststructuralists complained that it fetishized the role of the [[The Death of the Author|author]], at the expense of the reader and the text, and that its grand narrative, setting up a female canon in opposition to the male, was [[essentialist]], and omitted differences and divisions among women, leaving out [[lesbian]]s and [[women of color]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;Literary Terms." Fall 2002. Montclair State University (students of ENGL 605: Literary Research). 05 Jun. 2005 &lt;http://english.montclair.edu/isaacs/605LitResearch/litermFA02.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Race, class, social interest, political inclination, religion and sexuality&lt;ref name="Xu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; all arguably come into play in the construction of identity.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; Separating out such properties would create a [[one-dimensional]] view of the female, yet if gender and identity are merely constructs then it becomes difficult to assign any inherent qualities of nature or language to found a critique.&lt;ref name="Barry"/&gt;

Despite such limitations, gynocriticism offers a valuable interrogation of 'female' literature, through the study of sameness and difference in gender.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; While the term is rarely used in [[third-wave feminism]], the ''practices'' and canon establishment of gynocriticism continues to underpin [[feminist literary criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;I. Buchanan, ''A Dictionary of Critical Theory'' (2010) p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Washtenaw head start school superior township michigan.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Washtenaw County, Michigan]] Head Start school in [[Superior Township, Washtenaw County, Michigan|Superior Township]]]]
'''Head Start''' is a program of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] that provides comprehensive [[early childhood education]], health, [[nutrition]], and parent involvement services to low-income children and their families. The program's services and resources are designed to foster stable family relationships, enhance children's physical and [[emotional well-being]], and establish an environment to develop strong cognitive skills. The transition from  [[preschool]] to [[elementary school]] imposes diverse developmental challenges that include requiring the children to engage successfully with their peers outside the family network, adjust to the space of a classroom, and meet the expectations the school setting provides.&lt;ref name=Difference1&gt;{{cite journal | authors= McWayne, C.

Launched in 1965&lt;ref name=Difference2&gt;{{cite journal | authors = [[Janet Currie|Currie, J.]]; Thomas, D. | year = 1995 | journal = American Economic Review | volume = 85 | issue = 3 | page = 341 | url = http://www.psych.umn.edu/courses/spring05/mcguem/psy8935/readings/currie1995.pdf |title=Does Head Start Make A Difference? | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; by its creator and first director [[Jule Sugarman]], Head Start was originally conceived as a catch-up [[summer school]] program that would teach low-income children in a few weeks what they needed to know to start elementary school. The Head Start Act of 1981&lt;ref name=FDAMemo&gt;FDA. [http://www.fda.gov/oc/mous/domestic/225-89-2000.html Memorandum of Understanding].&lt;/ref&gt; expanded the program.&lt;ref name= CFC&gt;{{cite book |last=Gonzalez-Mena |first=Janet |title=Child, Family, and Community |edition=Fifth |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2009 |isbn=978-0135132302}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was revised when it was reauthorized in December 2007. Head Start is one of the longest-running programs attempting to address the effects of systemic poverty in the United States by intervening to aid children. {{as of|2005|alt= As of late 2005}}, more than 22 million children had participated.  The current director of Head Start is Dr. Deborah Bergeron &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ohs/about/leadership|title=ACF Home » Office of Head Start » About » Leadership|last=|first=|date=May 16, 2018|website=Administration for Children and Families|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Lady Bird Johnson Visiting a Classroom for Project Head Start 1966.gif|thumbnail|First Lady [[Lady Bird Johnson]] visits a Head Start class in 1966]]
Head Start began as part of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]] campaign. Its justification came from the staff of the President's [[Council of Economic Advisers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vinovskis |first=Maris A. |year=2005 |title=The Birth of Head Start |publisher=University of Chicago Press |pages=36–37 |isbn=978-0226856728}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stan Salett]], civil rights organizer, national education policy advisor and creator of the [[Upward Bound]] Program, is also credited with initiating the Head Start program.

Johnson started the War on Poverty shortly after President Kennedy's assassination. The murder shook the nation, and Johnson attempted to gain public trust by passing legacy legislation during the subsequent months. Johnson received an initial briefing from [[Walter Heller]], who informed Johnson of Kennedy's poverty program. By March 1964, the legislation, now known as the [[Economic Opportunity Act of 1964]], had been prepared for Congress. The legislation included training, educational, and service programs for communities, including the [[Job Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://presidentialrecordings.rotunda.upress.virginia.edu/essays?series=WarOnPoverty| title = Lyndon B. Johnson and the War on Poverty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Office of Economic Opportunity]]'s [[Community Action Program]] launched Project Head Start as an eight-week summer program in 1965. The program was led by Dr. Robert Cooke, a pediatrician at [[Johns Hopkins University]], and [[Edward Zigler|Dr. Edward Zigler]], a professor of psychology and director of the [[Yale Child Study Center]]. They designed a comprehensive child development program intended to help communities meet the needs of disadvantaged preschool children. The following year it was authorized by Congress as a year–round program. In 1968, Head Start began funding a television series that would eventually be called ''[[Sesame Street]]'', operated by the [[Carnegie Corporation]] [[Children's Television Workshop]] (CTW).

In 1969, Head Start was transferred to the Office of [[Child Development]] in the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (later the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS)) by the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]]. Today it is a program within the [[Administration for Children and Families]] (ACF) in DHHS.

In 1994, the Early Head Start program was established to serve children from birth to age three, in an effort to capitalize on research evidence that showed that the first three years are critical to children's long-term development. Programs are administered by local organizations and education agencies such as school systems.

In the early years, some 700,000 children enrolled at a per-capita cost of $2,000 to $3,000 (2011 dollars). Under the full-time program, enrollment dropped to under 400,000 by the early 1970s. Enrollment reached close to 1 million children by 2011.

== Policy Council ==
The Head Start Policy Council makes up part of the Head Start governing body. Policy Council must be composed of two types of representatives: parents of currently enrolled children and community representatives. At least 51% of the members of this group must be the parents of currently enrolled children (see 45 CFR 1306.3(h) for a definition of a Head Start Parent). All parent members of the Policy Council must stand for election or re-election annually. This is done through their individual parent groups.  Grantees/Delegates are required to provide proportionate representation to parents in all program options and settings. If agencies operate programs serving different geographical regions or ethnic groups, they must ensure that all groups being served will have an equal opportunity to serve on the Policy Council. The Policy Council is required to meet once each month. The term follows the federal government fiscal year, running November–November. Service on the Policy Council board is limited to three consecutive years per lifetime. The meetings are conducted in accordance with [[Robert's Rules]]. The meeting day and time is agreed upon during the first meeting of the term year and may be adjusted as needed.

The Policy Council approval is needed for several program functions, from new hires to the program, as well as for the budget and spending. The Council can serve the program in ways that the others in the program cannot, as it is the only body that is part of Head Start that can do fundraising. In addition to monthly meetings, Policy Council may at times need to hold special or emergency meetings or have a phone vote. Policy Council representatives are required to attend classroom meetings and report back to the Policy Council with issues and needs of the classroom. They may also be asked to sit in on interviews as Head Start requires that a Policy Council representative be present for all interviews. The officers of Policy Council include vice-chairperson, secretary, and vice-secretary. Classrooms are also able to elect alternate Policy Council reps in case the main rep is unable to attend the meetings.

== Services and programs ==
Head Start serves over 1 million children and their families each year in urban and rural areas in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories. Related health services include pre-school education health screenings, health check-ups and dental check-ups. Family advocates assist parents in accessing community resources. All services are specific to each family's culture and experience. Targets include cognitive, social, and emotional development.

Programs include:
* Early Head Start promotes healthy prenatal outcomes, healthy families, as well as infant and toddler development beginning as early as birth.
* Head Start helps to create healthy development in low-income children ages three to five.
* Family and Community Partnerships offers parents opportunities and support as they identify and meet their own goals, nurture their children and advocate for communities that support children and families.
* Migrant and Seasonal services are for children of migrant and seasonal farm workers. Services target children from six months to five years. Service hours are longer and programs extend for fewer months than traditional Head Start.
* Head Start also serves indigenous Americans, with centers on reservations as well as in urban communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ohs/| title = The Head Start Child Development and Early Learning Framework}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/hslc/states/aian&lt;/ref&gt;
* Homeless children were included explicitly as subjects with the 2007 reauthorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.naehcy.org | title = NAEHCY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs must identify and provide services to homeless children of all ages within a reasonable period.
*Tri-Counties Regional Center is one of twenty-one non-profit regional centers in California providing lifelong services and supports for people with developmental disabilities residing in San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tri-counties.org/who-we-are/|title=Who We Are - Tri Counties Regional Center|author=|date=|website=tri-counties.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Early Start is California's response to federal legislation ensuring that services to eligible infants and toddlers are coordinated and family-centered. It is a statewide system of early intervention services for infants and toddlers from birth to 36 months of age. This program is coordinated by regional centers and public school districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tri-counties.org/early-start-services/|title=Early Start Services - Tri Counties Regional Center|author=|date=|website=tri-counties.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Each eligible child will be assigned a Service Coordinator who will be responsible for the coordination of early intervention services. Eligible children and their families may receive a variety of early intervention services. Services for young children are family-centered, based on family concerns, priorities and resources, and provided in a child's natural setting. Services may include, but are not limited to:
** Infant stimulation (specialized instruction) in your home or community
** Physical, occupational and/or speech/language therapy
** Behavior services
** Family Resource Centers for parent-to-parent support&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tri-counties.org/services-early-start-program/|title=Services in the Early Start Program - Tri Counties Regional Center|author=|date=22 December 2017|website=tri-counties.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eligibility ==
Eligibility is largely income-based, although each local program includes other eligibility criteria, such as disabilities and services needed by other family members. Families must earn less than 100% of the [[Poverty in the United States|federal poverty level]].  Families may also qualify under a categorical eligibility category—receipt of [[Temporary Assistance to Needy Families]] (TANF) funds, Supplemental Security funds, or Homeless, as per the [[McKinney-Vento Act]]. Up to 10% of any funded program's enrollment can be from higher income families or families experiencing emergency situations. All programs are required to provide services to children with disabilities, who must comprise 10% of their total enrollment. Per the Head Start Act (2007), programs may elect to serve families whose income is between 100-130% under certain circumstances.  Programs must also complete additional reporting requirements if this is appropriate for their community.

== Budget and funding ==
The 2011 federal budget for Head Start was $8.1 billion. 85% was to be devoted to direct services and no more than 15% on administration, serving approximately one million students.

Local grantees must provide a 20% cash/in-kind match.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} Each local grantee is required to obtain an annual financial audit, if it receives more than $500,000 in federal support.

Grants are awarded by the [[Administration for Children and Families]] (ACF) Regional Offices and the American Indian – Alaska Native and Migrant and Seasonal Program Branches directly to local public agencies, private organizations, Indian tribes and school systems.&lt;ref name="acf.hhs.gov"&gt;{{citation | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | title = Head Start factsheet | url = http://www.acf.hhs.gov/opa/fact_sheets/headstart_factsheet.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100115192748/http://www.acf.hhs.gov/opa/fact_sheets/headstart_factsheet.html | archivedate = 2010-01-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The individual Head Start classrooms/centers "repay" the grant through a program known as InKind. The Inkind program is a way to get their parents and their students working together on out of class studies.

== Teachers ==
All lead teachers must have a bachelor's degree or be working towards one. Most have completed six or more courses in early-childhood education.&lt;ref name=nj14/&gt; By 2013, all teachers were to have [[associate of arts|associate degrees]] in a related field and half must have [[Bachelor of Arts|bachelor's degrees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Glod |first=Maria |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=November 15, 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/14/AR2007111401478.html |title= Bill to Expand Head Start, Bolster Its Teacher Qualifications Is Approved |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ohs/legislation/HS_act.html#648A|title=Head Start Act Section 648A|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012013719/http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ohs/legislation/HS_act.html#648A|archivedate=2008-10-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2003, the average Head Start teacher made $21,000 per year, compared to the public school teacher average of $43,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nieer.org/resources/facts/index.php?FastFactID=12 NIEER Fact Sheet on Head Start Teachers – July 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027053910/http://nieer.org/resources/facts/index.php?FastFactID=12 |date=2008-10-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers are also required to complete a (CDA) [[Child Development Associate]] certificate.

== Operations ==
Head Start programs typically operate independently from local school districts. Most often they are administered through local social-services agencies. Classes are generally small, with fewer than ten enrollees per adult staff member. Individual programs develop their own academic and social curricula, following federal performance standards.&lt;ref name=nj14&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-dubious-promise-of-universal-preschool |title=The Dubious Promise of Universal Preschool &gt; Publications &gt; |publisher=National Affairs |date=2013-12-20 |accessdate=2014-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408212309/http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-dubious-promise-of-universal-preschool |archivedate=2014-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
Many studies of program effectiveness have been conducted during Head Start's multi-decade history. The studies failed to produce an academic or political consensus about the program's effects.

=== Supportive studies and statements ===
In 2015, [http://www.ccr-analytics.com CCR Analytics], formerly Child Care Analytics, published the results of their Family Outcomes Survey completed by nearly 11,600 California Head Start and [[Early Head Start]] parents. 90% of parents surveyed said that Head Start helped them to get or keep a job. 92% of parents surveyed said that Head Start helped them to enroll in an educational or training program. 99% of families surveyed said that Head Start helped them to improve their parenting skills, such as responding to children's misbehavior and helping their children to learn. These results indicate that Head Start has a positive impact on the whole family, beyond the individual children who attend the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Outcomes Bulletin 2015|url=http://ccr-analytics.com/familyoutcomes2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [http://www.ccr-analytics.com CCR Analytics] published the results of their study of 49,467 children assessed in the 2012-2013 school year from 81 Head Start programs throughout the state of California (more than 50% of the entire California Head Start population). Participation in the study was open to all California Head Start programs who used the DRDP-PS 2010 assessment tool. The study found that providing two years of Head Start to a child increases the probability by between 13% to 86% that the child will meet age appropriate expectations. [[Regression discontinuity design]] was used to measure program impact without denying a [[control group]] the opportunity to attend Head Start.  The analysis compared three-year-olds enrolled in Head Start to four-year-olds who returned to Head Start for their second year. This also eliminated the issue of [[selection bias]] because both groups chose to attend Head Start as three-year-olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Child Outcomes Bulletin|url=http://ccr-analytics.com/bulletin2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, David Deming evaluated the program, using the [[National Longitudinal Survey of Youth]]. He compared siblings and found that those who attended Head Start showed stronger academic performance as shown on test scores for years afterward, were less likely to be diagnosed as learning-disabled, less likely to commit crime, more likely to graduate from high school and attend college, and less likely to suffer from poor health as an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1257/app.1.3.111| title = Early Childhood Intervention and Life-Cycle Skill Development: Evidence from Head Start| journal = American Economic Journal: Applied Economics| volume = 1| issue = 3| pages = 111| year = 2009| last1 = Deming | first1 = D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee collected data across sixty Head Start classrooms in 2007 and 2008. A sample of 1,260 children ages three to four were selected as the final sample. Of these children, 446 had entered Head Start at age 3 and enrolled for a year (Group 1); 498 had been entered at age 4 and enrolled for a year (Group 2); and 316 children had been enrolled for 2 years, entering at age 3 (Group 3). Academic outcome measures in literacy, math and science were collected based on the Head Start and Early Childhood Program Observational Checklist rating on a 4-point scale (1—not yet to 4—excels. Family risk factor indicators (developed by the State Department of Education) included single parent, unemployed parent, teenage parent, parental loss (divorce/death), low parental school achievement, food insufficiency. Group 3 had higher literacy, math and science scores than the other groups. Children in the high-risk group had significantly lower literacy, math, and science scores than those who had three or fewer risk factors. Head Start is associated with significant gains in test scores. Head Start significantly reduces the probability that a child will repeat a grade.&lt;ref name=Difference3&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/jcop.20462| title = Impacts of the duration of Head Start enrollment on children's academic outcomes: Moderation effects of family risk factors and earlier outcomes| journal = Journal of Community Psychology| volume = 39| issue = 6| pages = 698| year = 2011| last1 = Lee | first1 = K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Garces, Thomas and Currie used data from the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics to review outcomes for close to 4,000 participating adults followed from childhood and compared with non-participant siblings. Among European Americans, adults who had attended Head Start were significantly more likely to complete high school, attend college and possibly have higher earnings in their early twenties. African-American adults who had attended Head Start were significantly less likely to be booked/charged for a crime. Head Start may increase the likelihood that African-American males graduate from high school. Separately the authors noted larger effects for younger siblings who attended Head Start after an older sibling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eliana Garces |author2=Duncan Thomas |author3=Janet Currie | title= Longer-Term Effects of Head Start | journal= The American Economic Review |volume=92 |issue=4 |pages=999–1012 |date=September 2002 |doi=10.1257/00028280260344560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Congress mandated an intensive study of the effectiveness of Head Start, the ''"Head Start Impact Study",'' which studied a target population of 5,000 3- and 4-year-old children.&lt;ref name = "hsis-final"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/hs/impact_study/ | title = Impact study | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and Human Services}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study measured Head Start's effectiveness as compared to other forms of community support and educational intervention, as opposed to comparing Head Start to a nonintervention alternative. Head Start Impact Study First Year Findings were released in June 2005. Study participants were assigned to either Head Start or other parent–selected community resources for one year. 60% of the children in the control group were placed in other preschools. The first report showed consistent small to moderate advantages to 3-year-old children including pre-reading, pre-vocabulary and parent reports of children's literacy skills. No significant impacts were found for oral comprehension, phonological awareness, or early mathematics skills for either age group. Fewer positive benefits were found for 4-year-olds. The benefits improved with early participation and varied across racial and ethnic groups. These analyses did not assess the benefits' durability.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | format = PDF | url = http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/hs/impact_study/reports/first_yr_execsum/first_yr_execsum.pdf | title = First year executive summary | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and Human Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Datta summarized 31 studies, concluding that the program showed immediate improvement in [[IQ]] scores of participating children, though nonparticipants narrowed the difference over time.&lt;ref&gt;Datta, L. (1976). "The impact of the Westinghouse/Ohio evaluation on the development of project Head Start: An examination of the immediate and longer-term effects and how they came about," In C. C. Abt (Ed.), ''The Evaluation of Social Programs'' (pp. 129–181)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1990.tb02795.x| pmc = | last1 = Lee | first1 = V.

In 1975, Seitz, Abelson, Levine and Zigler compared disadvantaged children enrolled and not enrolled in Head Start, using the [[Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test]] (PPVT). The participants were low-income inner-city black children whose unemployed, economically disadvantaged parents were considered unskilled. The Head Start children had attended for at least five months at the time of testing, including nine boys and 11 girls. The non-enrolled group was on the Head Start waiting list. The control group consisted of 11 boys and nine girls. The groups were matched by family income, parental employment and marital status. The tester tested children at home and in a school or office setting. The Head Start children scored higher than the controls in both settings, which suggested preschool intervention programs may have influenced the result. The controls tested at home scored the lowest, apparently due to anxiety from having an unfamiliar person in their homes. The Head Start children were unaffected by the environmental factor. In evaluating this study vs. others, the relatively small sample size should be noted: 20 children vs. thousands in other studies.&lt;ref name="wiley.com"&gt;Seitz, V. Abelson, W., Levine, E. &amp; Zigler, E.[http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/ "Effects of place of testing on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test scores of disadvantaged Head Start and non-Head Start children"], ''Child Development'', 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mixed studies and statements ===
In 2005, Barnett and Hustedt reviewed the literature and stated,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our review finds mixed, but generally positive, evidence regarding Head Start's long-term benefits. Although studies typically find that increases in IQ fade out over time, many other studies also find decreases in grade retention and special education placements. Sustained increases in school achievement are sometimes found, but in other cases flawed research methods produce results that mimic fade-out. In recent years, the federal government has funded large-scale evaluations of Head Start and Early Head Start. Results from the Early Head Start evaluation are particularly informative, as study participants were randomly assigned to either the Early Head Start group or a control group. Early Head Start demonstrated modest improvements in children's development and parent beliefs and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Barnett, W. Steven |author2=Hustedt, Jason T. |title= Head Start's Lasting Benefits |journal=Infants &amp; Young Children |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=16–24 |date=January–March 2005 |doi=10.1097/00001163-200501000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 1995 within–family analysis compared subjects with nonparticipant siblings. Mothers who had themselves been enrolled in Head Start were compared to adult sisters who were not. Currie and Thomas separately analyzed white, black and Hispanic participants. White children, who were the most disadvantaged, showed larger and longer lasting improvements than black children.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Currie |last2=Thomas |url=http://lrainc.com/swtaboo/taboos/headst01.html |publisher=LRA |title=Head Start |year=1995 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207203313/http://lrainc.com/swtaboo/taboos/headst01.html |archivedate=February 7, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Head Start "fade" ===
"Head Start Fade", in which significant initial impacts quickly fade, has often been observed, as early as second and third grade.&lt;ref name="Valerie E. Lee, Susanna Loeb 62–82"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Valerie E. Lee |author2=Susanna Loeb |title= Where Do Head Start Attendees End up?

Lee, Susanna Loeb 62–82"/&gt;

=== Critical studies and statements ===

==== Head Start Impact study ====
A 2010 report by the [[Department of Health and Human Services]], ''Head Start Impact'', examined the cognitive development, social-emotional development, and physical health outcomes of 4,667&lt;ref name=nj14/&gt; three- and four-year-old children in a nationally representative sample of programs across 23 states. Children were randomly assigned to either a Head Start group (participants) or a non-Head Start group (control group). The children in the two groups were similar in all measured characteristics at program entry. Pre-participation assessments of all critical outcome measures were taken. Control group children optionally enrolled in non-Head Start programs. Nearly half of the control-group children enrolled in other preschool programs. Outcome measures covered cognitive development, social-emotional development, health status and access to health care, and parenting practices. Head Start students were split into two cohorts – 3-year-olds with two years of Head Start and 4-year-olds with one year of Head Start.&lt;ref  name=nj14/&gt; The study found:
* Participants showed positive effects in cognitive skills during their Head Start years, including letter-naming, vocabulary, letter-word identification and applied math problems,&lt;ref name=nj14/&gt; although the "advantages children gained during their Head Start and age 4 years yielded only a few statistically significant differences in outcomes at the end of 1st grade for the sample as a whole. Impacts at the end of kindergarten were scattered. ... "&lt;ref name=weigel/&gt; The gains applied to different skills across cohorts and grades, undermining generalizations about program impacts.&lt;ref name=nj14/&gt;
* Participants showed fewer significant improvements in social and behavioral skills, even in the Head Start year, with inconsistent results between the three- and four-year-old cohorts. The four-year-old cohort showed no significant improvement in the Head Start year or kindergarten, but in third grade, parents reported a significant reduction in total problem behavior and social and behavioral skills. Three-year-olds showed multiple, significant improvements in social and behavioral skills, but only for outcomes assessed by parents. Significant negative effects emerged in teacher relationships as rated by first-grade and third-grade teachers; and no significant positive effects for this cohort were reported by teachers for any elementary year.&lt;ref name=nj14/&gt;
* By the end of first grade, only "a single cognitive impact was found for each cohort". Compared to students in the control group, the 4-year-old Head Start cohort did "significantly better" on vocabulary and the 3-year-old cohort tested better in oral comprehension.&lt;ref name=weigel/&gt;
* Head Start had significant health-related effects, especially in increasing the number of children receiving dental care and having health-insurance coverage. These effects were not consistent, however. For example, while participants increased health-insurance coverage, it did not extend into the third-grade year for either cohort. Parenting practice changes were significant, but applied only to the three-year-old cohort. Most related to discipline, such as reduced spanking or time-outs. The spanking outcome occurred did not last into the first grade. The significant effect on parental reading to children did not last into kindergarten.&lt;ref name=nj14/&gt;

A secondary analysis by Peter Bernardy used HSIS data to explore the transient aspect of the initial effects. He considered whether learning skills not examined in the HSIS might be more durable than cognitive skills. These included attention, persistence, and confidence as evaluated by teachers, parents and independent assessors. Improvements in these skills could portend better longer-term outcomes.&lt;ref name=nj14/&gt;

Bernardy also examined whether Head Start curriculum or elementary school quality affected outcomes and whether control group attendance at other preschools compromised the results. Only one effect was statistically significant out of the 43 possible comparisons, and none was in the elementary grades. Since statistical significance is generally measured at the 95th percentile, the false positive rate is 5 percent, meaning that approximately 2 "significant" effects would be expected to emerge from the 43 comparisons even if the data were random. The significant effect reported was the parent rating of attention at the end of the Head Start year for three-year-old children. This finding was not buttressed by ratings by independent assessors and teachers.&lt;ref name=nj14/&gt;

The HSIS study concludes, "Head Start has benefits for both 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds in the cognitive, health, and parenting domains, and for 3-year-olds in the social-emotional domain. However, the benefits of access to Head Start at age four are largely absent by 1st grade for the program population as a whole. For 3-year-olds, there are few sustained benefits, although access to the program may lead to improved parent-child relationships through 1st grade, a potentially important finding for children's longer-term development."&lt;ref name=weigel&gt;{{cite web |last= Weigel |first= Margaret |date= August 11, 2011 |url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/civil-rights/head-start-study/ |title = Head Start Impact: Department of Health and Human Services Report |publisher = Journalist's Resource.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other comments ====
According to the Administrative History of the Office of Economic Opportunity, children who finish the program and are placed into disadvantaged schools perform worse than their peers by second grade. Only by isolating such children (such as dispersing and sending them to better-performing school districts) could gains be sustained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cencomfut.com/OEO%20and%20CSA%20Instructions/OEO%20Administrative%20History%20Nov%201963%20--%20Jan%201969.pdf Administrative History of the Office of Economic Opportunity, Vol. I], p. 252, Box 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In an op-ed piece in ''The New York Times'', "Head Start Falls Further Behind", Besharov and Call discuss a 1998 evaluation that led to a national reevaluation of the program. The authors stated that research concluded that the current program had little meaningful impact. However, they did not cite primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2011, ''Time'' magazine's columnist [[Joe Klein]] called for the elimination of Head Start, citing an internal report that the program is costly and makes a negligible impact on children's well-being over time. Klein wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You take the million or so poorest 3- and 4-year-old children and give them a leg up on socialization and education by providing preschool for them; if it works, it saves money in the long run by producing fewer criminals and welfare recipients ... it is now 45 years later. We spend more than $7 billion providing Head Start to nearly 1 million children each year. And finally there is indisputable evidence about the program's effectiveness, provided by the Department of Health and Human Services: Head Start simply does not work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2081778,00.html#ixzz1UqSuspUQ |title = Time to Ax Public Programs That Don't Yield Results |work = Time | first=Joe |last=Klein |date=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

W. Steven Barnett, director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at [[Rutgers University]], rebutted Klein, "Weighing all of the evidence and not just that cited by partisans on one side or the other, the most accurate conclusion is that Head Start produces modest benefits including some long-term gains for children."&lt;ref&gt;Valerie Strauss, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/03/05/does-head-start-work-for-kids-the-bottom-line/ Does Head Start work for kids? The bottom line]", [[The Washington Post]], March 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fryer and Levitt found no evidence that Head Start participation had lasting effect on test scores in the early years of school.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Understanding the blacK-white test score gap in the first two years of school | year = 2004 | last1 = Fryer | last2 = Levitt | publisher = University of Chicago | format = PDF | url = http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/FryerLevittUnderstandingTheBlack2004.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23234">A '''heritage language''' is a [[minority language]] learnt by its speakers at home as children, but it is never fully developed because its speakers grow up with a [[dominant language]] in which they become more competent.&lt;ref&gt;Valdés, G. 2000. The teaching of heritage languages: an introduction for Slavic-teaching professionals. The learning and teaching of Slavic languages and cultures, Olga Kagan and Benjamin Rifkin (eds.), 375–403.&lt;/ref&gt; Polinsky &amp; Kagan label it as a continuum that ranges from fluent speakers to barely-speaking individuals of the [[home language]]. In some countries or cultures in which they determine one's mother tongue by the ethnic group, a heritage language would be linked to the native language.&lt;ref name="Polinsky 2007"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Polinsky|Kagan|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term can also refer to the language of a person's family or community that the person does not speak or understand but culturally identify with it.&lt;ref name="Valdés 2005"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdés|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelleher 2010"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kelleher|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions and use==
"Heritage language" is the term used to describe a language which is predominantly spoken by "nonsocietal"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/non+societal |title=Societal &amp;#124; Define Societal at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; groups and [[linguistic minorities]].&lt;ref name="Valdés 2005"/&gt; 

In various fields, such as foreign language education and [[linguistics]], the definitions of heritage language become more specific and divergent. In foreign language education, heritage language is defined in terms of a student’s upbringing and functional proficiency in the language: a student raised in a home where a non-majority language is spoken is a heritage speaker of that language if she/he possesses some proficiency in it.&lt;ref name="Valdés 2005"/&gt;  Under this definition, individuals that have some cultural connection with the language but do not speak it are not considered heritage students. This restricted definition became popular in the mid 1990s with the publication of ''Standards for Foreign Language Learning'' by the [[American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages]].&lt;ref name="Valdés 2005"/&gt;

Among linguists, heritage language is an end-state language that is defined based on the temporal order of acquisition and, often, the language dominance in the individual.&lt;ref name="Valdés 2005"/&gt; A heritage speaker acquires the heritage language as their [[first language]] through natural input in the home environment and acquires the majority language as a [[second language]],&lt;ref name="Montrul 2008"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Montrul|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually when she/he starts school and talks about different topics with people in school, or by exposure through media (written texts, internet, popular culture etc.).&lt;ref name="benmamoun1"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Benmamoun|Montrul|Polinsky|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As exposure to the heritage language decreases and exposure to the majority language increases, the majority language becomes the individual’s dominant language and acquisition of the heritage language changes.&lt;ref name="Montrul 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Valdés 2005"/&gt; The results of these changes can be seen in divergence of the heritage language from monolingual norms in the areas of [[phonology]], lexical knowledge (knowledge of vocabulary or words), [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]] and [[code-switching]], although mastery of the heritage language may vary from purely receptive skills in only informal spoken language to native-like [[fluency]].&lt;ref name="benmamoun1"/&gt;

===Controversy in definition===
As stated by Polinsky and Kagan: "The definition of a heritage speaker in general and for specific languages continues to be debated. The debate is of particular significance in such languages as [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Arabic]], and languages of [[India]] and the [[Philippines]], where speakers of multiple languages or dialects are seen as heritage speakers of a single standard language taught for geographic, cultural or other reasons ([[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Classical Arabic]], [[Hindi]], or [[Filipino language|Tagalog]], respectively)."&lt;ref name="Polinsky 2007" /&gt;

One idea that prevails in the literature is that "[heritage] languages include [[indigenous languages]] that are often endangered. . . as well as world languages that are commonly spoken in many other regions of the world (Spanish in the United States, Arabic in France)"&lt;ref name="Valdés 2005" /&gt;. However, that view is not shared worldwide. In Canada, for example, Indigenous languages are not classified as heritage languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/aboriginal-people-languages/|title=Indigenous Languages in Canada|last=|first=|date=|website=Historica Canada|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The label ''heritage'' is given to a language based principally on the social status of its speakers and not necessarily on any linguistic property. Thus, while [[Spanish language|Spanish]] typically comes in second in terms of [[list of languages by number of native speakers|native speakers worldwide]] and has official status in a number of countries, it is considered a heritage language in the English-dominant United States.&lt;ref name="Valdés 2005" /&gt; Outside the United States, heritage language definitions and use vary.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://umanitoba.ca/faculties/education/media/Babaee12.pdf|title=Heritage Language Learning in Canadian Public Schools: Language Rights Challenges|last=Babaee|first=Naghmeh|date=|website=University of Manitoba|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danesi, M., McLeod, K., &amp; Morris, S. (Eds.). (1993). ''Heritage language and education: The Canadian experience''. Oakville, ON: Mosaic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Speakers of the same heritage language raised in the same community may differ significantly in terms of their language abilities, yet be considered heritage speakers under this definition. Some heritage speakers may be highly proficient in the language, possessing several [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]], while other heritage speakers may be able to understand the language but not produce it. Other individuals that simply have a cultural connection with a minority language but do not speak it may consider it to be their heritage language.&lt;ref name="Valdés 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelleher 2010" /&gt; It is held by some that ownership does not necessarily depend on usership: “Some Aboriginal people distinguish between usership and ownership. There are even those who claim that they own a language although they only know one single word of it: its name.”&lt;ref&gt;See p. 113 of [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Revival_Linguistics.pdf]{{cite journal|last1=Zuckermann|first1=Ghil'ad|last2=Walsh|first2=Michael|year=2011|title=Stop, Revive, Survive: Lessons from the Hebrew Revival Applicable to the Reclamation, Maintenance and Empowerment of Aboriginal Languages and Cultures]|journal=Australian Journal of Linguistics|volume=31|pages=111–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proficiency in heritage languages ==
[[Heritage language learning|Heritage learners]] have a fluent command of the dominant language and are comfortable using it in formal settings, due to their exposure to the language through [[formal education]].&lt;ref name="Montrul 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their command of the heritage language, however, varies widely. Some heritage learners may lose some fluency in the first language after beginning formal education in the dominant language.&lt;ref name="Polinsky 2007"/&gt; Others may use the heritage language consistently at home and with family, but receive minimal to no formal training in the heritage language and thus may struggle with literacy skills or using it in broader settings outside of the home.&lt;ref name="Polinsky 2007"/&gt; An additional factor that affects the acquisition of the learner, is whether he or she shows willingness or reluctance towards learning the heritage language.&lt;ref&gt;Dressler, R. (2010). "There Is No Space for Being German": Portraits of Willing and Reluctant Heritage Language Learners of German. ''Heritage Language Journal, 7''(2), 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

One factor that has been shown to influence the loss of fluency in the heritage language is age. Studies have shown that younger bilingual children are more susceptible to fluency loss than older bilingual children.&lt;ref name="Montrul 2008"/&gt; The older the child is when the dominant language is introduced, the less likely he/she is going to lose ability in using his/her first language (the heritage language).&lt;ref name="Montrul 2008"/&gt; This is because the older the child is, the more exposure and knowledge of use the child will have had with the heritage language, and thus the heritage language will remain as their primary language.&lt;ref name="Polinsky 2007"/&gt; Researchers found that this phenomenon primarily deals with the memory network of an individual. Once a memory network is organized, it is difficult for the brain to reorganize information contrary to the initial information, because the previous information was processed first.&lt;ref name="Au 2008"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Au|Oh|Knightly|Jun|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon becomes a struggle for adults who are trying to learn a different language. Once an individual has learned a language fluently, they will be heavily influenced by the grammatical rules and pronunciations of their first language they learned, while learning a new language.&lt;ref name="Montrul 2008"/&gt;

An emerging effective way of measuring the proficiency of a heritage speaker is by speech rate. A study of gender restructuring in heritage Russian showed that heritage speakers fell into two groups: those who maintained the three-gender system and those who radically reanalyzed the system as a two-gender system. The heritage speakers who reanalyzed the three-gender system as a two-gender system had a strong correlation with a slower speech rate. The correlation is straightforward—lower proficiency speakers have more difficulty accessing lexical items; thus, their speech is slowed down.&lt;ref name="Polinsky 2008"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Polinsky|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although speech rate has been shown to be an effective way of measuring proficiency of heritage speakers, some heritage speakers are reluctant to produce any heritage language whatsoever. Lexical proficiency is an alternative method that is also effective in measuring proficiency.&lt;ref name="Polinsky 2000"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Polinsky|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study with heritage Russian speakers, there was a strong correlation between the speaker's knowledge of lexical items (measured using a basic word list of about 200) and the speaker's control over grammatical knowledge such as agreement, temporal marking, and embedding.&lt;ref name="Polinsky 2000"/&gt;

Some heritage speakers explicitly study the language to gain additional proficiency. The learning trajectories of heritage speakers are markedly different from the trajectories of second language learners with little or no previous exposure to a target language. For instance, heritage learners typically show a phonological advantage over second language learners in both perception and production of the heritage language, even when their exposure to the heritage language was interrupted very early in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Au|Knightly|Jun|Oh|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Oh|Jun|Knightly|Au|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heritage speakers also tend to distinguish, rather than conflate, easily confusable sounds in the heritage language and the dominant language more reliably than second language learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Chang|Yao|Haynes|Rhodes|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In morphosyntax as well, heritage speakers have been found to be more native-like than second language learners,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Au|Romo|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Au 2008"/&gt; although they are typically significantly different from native speakers.&lt;ref name="Montrul 2002"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Montrul|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polinsky 2008"/&gt;
Many linguists frame this change in heritage language acquisition as “incomplete acquisition” or "attrition."&lt;ref name="Montrul 2002"/&gt; "Incomplete acquisition," loosely defined by Montrul, is "the outcome of language acquisition that is not complete in childhood."&lt;ref name="Montrul 2008"/&gt; In this incomplete acquisition, there are particular properties of the language that were not able to reach age-appropriate levels of proficiency after the dominant language has been introduced. Attrition, as defined by Montrul, is the loss of a certain property of a language after one has already mastered it with native-speaker level accuracy.&lt;ref name="Montrul 2008"/&gt; These two cases of language loss have been used by Montrul and many other linguists to describe the change in heritage language acquisition. However, this is not the only viewpoint of linguists to describe heritage language acquisition. One argument against incomplete acquisition is that the input that heritage speakers receive is different from monolinguals (the input may be affected by cross-generational attrition, among other factors), thus the comparison of heritage speakers against monolinguals is weak.&lt;ref name="rothman1"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pascual Y. Cabo|Rothman|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument by Pascual and Rothman claims that the acquisition of the heritage language is therefore not incomplete, but complete and simply different from monolingual acquisition of a language.&lt;ref name="rothman1"/&gt; Another argument argues for a shift in focus on the result of incomplete acquisition of a heritage language to the process of heritage language acquisition. In this argument, the crucial factor in changes to heritage language acquisition is the extent to which the heritage speaker activates and processes the heritage language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Putnam|Sánchez|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new model thus moves away from language acquisition that is dependent on the exposure to input of the language and moves towards dependence on the frequency of processing for production and comprehension of the heritage language.

Some colleges and universities offer courses prepared for speakers of heritage languages. For example, students who grow up learning some Spanish in the home may enroll in a course that will build on their Spanish abilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.uta.edu/coursedescriptions/span/ Heritage Spanish courses at a university]&lt;/ref&gt;

 | quote = Many people who live in the United States have cultural connections to and know languages other than English. These languages are not “foreign” to particular individuals or communities; instead, they are ''familiar'' in a variety of ways. Some people may be able to speak, read, and write the language; others may only speak or understand when spoken to. Some may not understand the language but are part of a family or community where the language is spoken. The term “heritage” language can be used to describe any of these connections between a non-dominant language and a person, a family, or a community.

'''Hermel''' ({{lang-ar|الهرمل}}) is a town in [[Baalbek-Hermel Governorate]], [[Lebanon]]. It is the capital of [[Hermel District]]. Hermel is home to a Lebanese [[Red Cross]] First Aid Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dm.net.lb/redcross/our_centers.html Our Centers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212084701/http://www.dm.net.lb/redcross/our_centers.html |date=2006-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hermel's inhabitants are predominantly [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shia Muslim]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Car bomb blasts Lebanese town near Syria border|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/16/car-bomb-blasts-lebanese-town-hermel-syria|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an ancient [[pyramid]] known as [[Kamouh el Hermel]] (Pyramid or Needle of Hermel) located about {{convert|6|km|mi}} south of the town that is a popular attraction for local tourists.&lt;ref name="Doyle2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Doyle|title=Lebanon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tzsRk0hvb_MC&amp;pg=PA215|accessdate=26 September 2012|date=1 March 2012|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-370-2|pages=215–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
===Hermel plains===
The Hermel plains are an area of low hills around Hermel, through which runs the [[Orontes river|Orontes]] river and several [[wadi]]s, which drain into the [[Homs]] basin. The area dominates the north of the [[Beqaa Valley]] and reaches north to the border with [[Syria]].  A [[curious]] and unpublished [[archaeological industry]] exists from finds of stone tools in this area.  It consists of generally small tools whose typology is limited. It was termed the [[Shepherd Neolithic]] industry by [[Henri Fleisch]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lorraine Copeland|author2=P. Wescombe|title=Inventory of Stone-Age sites in Lebanon, p. 43 &amp; 45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YsRRwAACAAJ|accessdate=21 July 2011|year=1965|publisher=Imprimerie Catholique}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hermel I (Mrah Abbas)===
Hermel I or Mrah Abbas was discovered by P. Billaux and [[Maurice Tallon]] and is {{convert|5|km|mi}} north northeast of Hermel, {{convert|1|km|mi}} before reaching [[Mrah Abbas]], next to the road. It is located on an uncultivated sloping plain leading down {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the [[Orontes river|Orontes]]. The garden revealed the remains of ten [[dolmen]]s, most of which were built on a larger foundation than the covered chamber. Some were perhaps not covered by [[tumuli]] and a few were evidently not built to have cap-stones on top.&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=L. Copeland|author2=P. Wescombe|title=Inventory of Stone-Age Sites in Lebanon: North, South and East-Central Lebanon, p. 32-33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qhPRQwAACAAJ|accessdate=3 March 2011|year=1966|publisher=Impr. Catholique}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hermel II (Jisr el Aassi)===
Hermel II or Jisr el Aassi is {{convert|2|km|mi}} east of Hermel I near the gorge through which the Orontes river flows. It was found by P. Billaux and mentioned by Maurice Tallon in 1958 who made a lenghy description of the largest tumulus in 1959.&lt;ref name="Tallon"/&gt; The [[Lithic technology|lithic]] industry at the site was discussed by [[Henri Fleisch]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Fleisch, Henri., Notes de Préhistoire Libanaise : 1) Ard es Saoude. 2) La Bekaa Nord. 3) Un polissoir en plein air. BSPF, vol. 63, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Several dolmens were found around the village of [[Choueighir]], around {{convert|1|km|mi}} north of the bridge over the Orontes, in and around the village extending about {{convert|2|km|mi}} to the north along the track next to the river. Some of the dolmen are inclined inwards forming a [[pyramid]] shape. There is a large tumulus north of the village that is composed of massive blocks where [[pottery]] was found and dated to the [[Early Bronze Age]] III by Tallon.&lt;ref name="Tallon"/&gt; Henri Fleisch found a collection of [[Shepherd Neolithic]] flints around these dolmen.&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=L.

Catholique}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hermel III (Choueighir)===
Hermel III or Choueighir is a village on the left (western) bank of the Orontes and an archaeological site was found by P. Billaux {{convert|2|km|mi}} to the north of it. [[Flint]] material was described to be of the Shepherd Neolithic type and similar to that of [[Maakne]] and [[el Qaa]] by Henri Fleisch in 1966, it is held in the [[Museum of Lebanese Prehistory]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=L.

Catholique}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hermel IV (Wadi el Joz)===
Hermel IV or Wadi el Joz is a collection of [[megalith]]s that are {{convert|1.5|km|mi}} east of [[Hermel Attika]], southeast of Hermel on dry terraces that slope towards the channel of the Orontes. It was found by Mohammed Hamadé, surveyed by P. Billaux and published by Maurice Tallon in 1959.&lt;ref name="Tallon"&gt;Tallon, Maurice., Tumulus et Mégalithes du Hermel et de la Beqa Nord. MUSJ, vol. 31, fasc. 3, p. 91, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of tumuli were discovered in this area which covered chambers on rectangular foundation platforms. They were usually orientated east to west with some remnants of walls constructed of megalithic stones. Maurice Tallon made collectins of flint and pottery from the area dating to various periods. These included an incised [[sherd]] and a [[tang (tools)|tanged]] scraper from the very earliest [[Neolithic]] times, an Early Bronze Age flat scraper along with later [[Middle Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] material.&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31727">The Republic of [[Haiti]] is located on western portion of the island [[Hispaniola]] in the Caribbean. Haiti declared its independence from France in the aftermath of the first successful slave revolution in the Americas in 1804, and their identification as conquerors of a racially repressed society is a theme echoed throughout Haiti's history.

==Nationality prior to 1803==
Haiti has a unique history of racial ideology. During its colonial period, class structure shifted from one based on wealth, to divisions distinguished by race.  Once accepted as elite, families of African descent were rejected because of racist stereotypes.  This regression shaped the evolution of the [[Haitian Revolution]] as peoples of [[African descent]] rose up against the white colonial planters. Haitians are primarily of African descent but a lot of Haitians are also of the indigenous Taino descent (Arawak native Indians) which inhabited the island prior to Christopher Columbus's arrival. The Taino were nearly wiped out due to diseases the Europeans brought with them and because of cruel practices including slavery. The Tainos fled to the mountains just before the Africans arrived on the island. Mixing between the remaining Tainos and some of the Africans occurred and it is believed a lot of Haitians in present-day have some ancestral links to the indigenous Tainos.

===Nationality in Saint-Domingue before 1763===
As part of the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]], nationality in [[Saint-Domingue]], now the Republic of Haiti, was based on a mixture of economics and race, combining white planter elite, black slaves, and free black planters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Mackenzie (diplomat)|Charles Mackenzie]], ''Notes on Haiti: Made During a Residence in That Republic''. Vol. II. (London: Frank Cass and Co. Ltd., 1830), 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Haiti was unusual, as it was the only slave society in the [[Americas]] with a significant population of free black planters.&lt;ref&gt;Garrigus, J.D. (2006). Before Haiti: Race and Citizenship in French Saint-Domingue., 3&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most colonial slave societies, status was based on economics rather than race, creating a unified master class of both races.  "Whereas the freedmen in all other slave societies entered at the lowest ranks of free society, in the French West Indies they were often permitted to enter the class of plantation owners from the beginning."  &lt;ref&gt;Herbert Klein in Garrigus, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, [[imperialism|imperial policy]] and the inequality of slavery's distribution of freedom and wealth excluded all blacks from the civil, public sphere of society.  However, those with little or no official power were able to use public law to fight for their security in liberty and justice.&lt;ref name="Garrigus, 12"&gt;Garrigus, 12&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many slaves were able to use the French Code Noir marriage provision and claim independence.&lt;ref name="Garrigus, 12"/&gt; There was no fine line between the races as [[Miscegenation|interracial relationships]] were not uncommon; colonists often had sexual relations with their slaves, generally recognizing the paternity of their children and freeing them from slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Garrigus, 6&lt;/ref&gt; Men and women who escaped slavery were able to assert themselves in [[civil society]]; the opportunity to advance economically was not reserved for white Europeans.

===Code Noir===
Also known as "The Black Code", this set of laws was written in 1685 concerning the governance of the [[History of Saint Pierre and Miquelon|French American Islands]].  It determined and regulated the status of different social classes.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth R. Redden, (ed.), "The Legal System of Haiti." ''Modern Legal Systems Cyclopedia''. (Buffalo, New York: William S. Hein &amp; Co., Law Publisher, 1989), (7.210.12).&lt;/ref&gt; [[King Louis XIV]] composed these laws to assert French presence in his Caribbean territories, and to assert [[Christianity]] and control over the free black population.  Its purpose was to regulate hours of work and food distribution, limitations of punishments, and formally limit slave-owners' otherwise arbitrary power.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon S. Brown ''Toussaint's Clause: The Founding Fathers and the Haitian Revolution'' (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 1936), 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The Code expelled all [[Jews]], forced all slaves to be baptized, and made provisions concerning the citizenship status of freed blacks.  According to Article 59, emancipated blacks were to be granted the same privileges as native-born French subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/fac/peabody/codenoir.htm Code Noir&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Article LIX.&lt;br /&gt;We grant to manumitted slaves the same rights, privileges and liberties enjoyed by persons born free; desiring that they merit this acquired liberty and that it produce in them, both for their persons and for their property, the same effects that the good fortune of natural liberty causes in our other subjects.}}

Yet freed blacks generally suffered worse conditions than those enslaved.  All blacks were considered public property, so although they were not tied to a single master, all blacks suffered under racial laws.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, 9&lt;/ref&gt;
*for three years all had to serve in the "maréchaussee" militia to catch fugitive slaves
*had to serve in the general militia
*obliged to a corvée to maintain the roadways
*could not be employed publicly or in a liberal profession (for example, schoolteachers)
*those of mixed races could not use the name of their white parent

===Nationality after the Seven Year War===
When the [[Seven Years' War]] ended in 1763, a shift in French colonists' self-identity due to the ensuing political conflicts redefined a line between the races. In an effort to reaffirm their French identity politically and culturally, white colonists defined their bond with the metropole through race. Colonists and imperial administrators created a new public sphere in by which people were unfit for civil life based on their constructed racial sexual stereotypes; those that were unfit were not allowed to practice their citizenship rights.&lt;ref&gt;Garrigus, 8&lt;/ref&gt;  Resentful of black success, the colonial elite segregated themselves from their counterparts, the wealthy Creole and ex-slave families, by using race instead of wealth to classify their high level of society.&lt;ref&gt;Garrigus, 4&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, everyone, regardless of wealth, who had one African grandparent had to identify themselves as "quarteron," a person of color.&lt;ref&gt;Garrigus, 1&lt;/ref&gt; Colonial administration used racism as a tool in developing a Saint-Domingue identity. The French law of colonial citizenship being fully "white" was influenced by the enlightenment's emphasis on the purity of ‘whiteness." &lt;ref&gt;Garrigus, 149&lt;/ref&gt; The French Constitution of 1791 specifically left out French territories:

{{quote|The French colonies and possessions in Asia, Africa, and America, although they form part of the French dominion, are not in the present constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Albert P. Blaustein and Jay A. Sigler, ''Constitutions That Made History'' (New York: Paragon House Publishers, 1988), 112.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By excluding Haiti in this Constitution, which contained the Declaration of the Rights of Man, Haiti was denied the same rights as other French subjects. As a new definition French Citizenship was developing with the progression of the French Revolution, elite men of color began to fight for their rights as citizens.

===Haitian Revolution===
The development of Haitian nationality is marked by its declaration of independence on January 1, 1804.  The Caribbean island won its independence from France after a period of harsh colonial rule in the first successful slave rebellion, making Haiti the second independent country in North America after the United States.  As ideas of the [[French Revolution]] spread, a movement against the oppressive Black Code developed.

====The Free Colored Narrative====
In the first century after independence, descendants of the wealthy black planter elite ruled Haiti.  These "mulatrist" historians supported a narrative of the Haitian Revolution that focused on the free colored revolutionaries.  As their ancestors had been leaders of the revolution, it followed naturally that the superior elite planters of mixed race should lead the new Haiti. "Mulatrists" went so far as to claim they could not be guilty of racism towards the darker skinned constituency because they had suffered under French racism.&lt;ref name="Garrigus, p.13"&gt;Garrigus, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1788, the [[Society of the Friends of the Blacks]], an abolitionist group, formed in Paris to reform the harsh racial laws in Saint-Domingue.  With support from wealthy free black planters such as [[Julien Raimond]], the Society of the Friends of the Blacks took the issue to trial.  Instead of outright arguing against the slave trade, Raimond and the Society campaigned for the recognition of citizenship for mixed-race colonists.&lt;ref&gt;Garrigus, 17&lt;/ref&gt; In 1791, the very same Paris legislation who voted on the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen]] ruled in favor of the society, granting voting rights to free blacks, albeit limited voting rights.  Unable to tolerate this decision as it would destabilize the slave regime, white colonialists reacted in violence, only to start a civil war with the free and enslaved black people of Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;Garrigus, 2&lt;/ref&gt; It was this "mulatto" oligarchy that led Haitians through their Revolution from France.

====The "Black" Revolutionary Narrative====
By the twentieth century, this view had shifted to focus on the slave rebellion and its ex-slave leaders like Louverture and Dessalines.  This "black" Revolutionary narrative served to promote Haitian national identity, focusing on the strength of a colonial repressed society rather than its leaders.  Haiti even adopted a new national anthem "La Dessalinienne", promoting the culture of the rural majority.&lt;ref name="Garrigus, p.13"/&gt;

When England and Spain invaded in 1793, they were defeated by ex-slave [[Toussaint Louverture]], leader of the French and native army.  As the white and black populations mobilized against one another, Louverture led the oppressed slaves in the Haitian Revolution, naming himself Governor-General for Life in the [[Constitution of Haiti|1801 Constitution]].  Fighting between blacks and whites would continue, as [[Napoleon]] sent [[Charles Leclerc|General Charles Lecerc]] to arrest Louverture and re-instate slavery.  In 1803, another rebellion against the French colonists was led by [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]].  The successful rebellion ended the civil war in 1804 with the Declaration of Haitian Independence and Dessalines was proclaimed Emperor of Haiti in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Redden, (7.210.6)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign recognition of Haiti as a nation==
Recognizing Haiti as a nation was difficult for those countries that did not want to be associated with a free slave society.  In dealing with foreign policy, Haiti wanted to be seen as an equal nation.  Haiti granted automatic citizenship to anyone of African or Amerindian origin, and even went so far as to invite these oppressed peoples to settle in Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;Brenda G. Plummer, Haiti and the Great Powers, 1902-1915 (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State UP, 1988), 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Their fight to be recognized reflects the Haitian desire to be equal, and thus free.

===France===
France recognized Haitian independence in 1825.  This recognition was indirect, "masked by a degree of doublespeak that would have made [[Talleyrand]] proud", and only transpired after a Haiti paid huge reparations.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p.294&lt;/ref&gt; However, Haiti was able to open normal relations with their former colonizers.

===United States of America===
Prior to the Haitian Revolution, Haiti had been the United States' second largest trading partner, second only to Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 293&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the early nineteenth century America was very much a slave society, and balked at the idea of supporting a slave revolt that took over a nation.  The United States was divided; merchants wanted to continue trade while southern slave owners wanted to isolate or even repress the new Haitians.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 7&lt;/ref&gt; Until [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]] unified Haiti in 1820, commercial relations were limited.&lt;ref name="Brown, 292"&gt;Brown, 292&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[American Civil War]] progressed and the United States' stance on black liberation began to shift, so did their views of Haiti and [[Liberia]] (another free black country).  As an imperialistic nation, the US had trouble with a nation that granted civil status to whom they deemed unworthy; while they had slavery, the US could not recognize Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;Plummer, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|If any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding our recognition of the sovereignty and independence of Haiti and Liberia, I am unable to discern it...It does not admit of doubt that important commercial advantages may be obtained by treaties with them.|Abraham Lincoln to Congress, December 3, 1861|&lt;ref name="Brown, 292"/&gt;}}

In 1863, [[Abraham Lincoln]] officially recognized Haiti and Liberia as independent and sovereign, and signed a treaty of amity and commerce in 1865.  The subsequent black Haitian ambassador in [[Washington, D.C.]] was recognized as an equal in American politics.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 295&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enfranchisement of Haitian peoples through law==
{{Main|Constitution of Haiti}}

===History of the legal system===
Prior to Haitian independence, Saint-Domingue was a colony under French rule, but laws were made specifically for Saint-Domingue as a colony.  For example:
*The Constitution of 1765 separated the military from the civil government
*The Edict of August, 1765 established a judicial system

However, after the 1789 Revolution, all developments in French law also pertained to Saint-Domingue as a colony came under a more direct empirical ruling.  The important developments of this time period are:
*The decree of April 4, 1792, which granted political equality to emancipated slaves
*The decree of February 4, 1794, which abolished slavery &lt;ref&gt;Redden, (7.210.12)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Constitutions of 1801 and 1805====
Louverture's 1801 Constitution freed all slaves, but required their presence on the island as workers.&lt;ref name="Redden, 7.210.8"&gt;Redden, (7.210.8)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Dessaline's 1805 constitution held racial laws: Haitians (all considered black) could not marry white foreigners.&lt;ref name="Redden, 7.210.7"&gt;Redden, (7.210.7)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Constitution of 1806====
This ended the authoritative regime of Dessalines, creating three separate branches of government. This changed the relationship between the citizen and the state, empowering the citizen.   However, the legislative branch represented by the Senate remained the most powerful.&lt;ref name="Redden, 7.210.8"/&gt;

====Constitution of 1816====
Lasting until 1843, this constitution leveled the power of the three branches and brought in civil ideas from the French declaration in 1789 of fundamental rights.&lt;ref name="Redden, 7.210.9"&gt;Redden, (7.210.9)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Haitian Civil Code of 1825====
In 1825, Haiti established the first Haitian Civil Code, adopted mainly in part from the Napoleonic Code.  Two years later the Code of Civil Procedure, the Rural Code, and the Commercial Code were established; these are the foundations of Haiti's legal system today.

When Riviere Harard unified Haiti, he abolished the law criminalizing Haitian and white foreign marriage.&lt;ref name="Redden, 7.210.7"/&gt;

====Constitution of 1918====
Adopted during US occupation, this Constitution focused on property rights of foreigners.  Previously, to ensure against foreign white domination, no white foreigner was permitted to own real estate.  Contrastingly, all black foreigners could easily acquire Haitian nationality.  In 1918, foreigners, regardless of race, could own land for business or residency purposes, losing those rights five years after that purpose ended.&lt;ref name="Redden, 7.210.9"/&gt;

====Constitution of 1950====
Article 88 gave power directly to the citizen constituency, as the President of the Republic would now be directly voted upon by citizens.&lt;ref name="Redden, 7.210.9"/&gt;

===Duvalierist constitution of 1983===

====Citizenship media====
The follow is found in Article 21: Citizenship.

=====Duvalierist descent=====
*born in Haiti to a Haitian mother or father
*born in a foreign country to Haitian parents
*born in Haiti to a foreign father; if not recognized by father, it is acceptable to be recognized by a foreign mother only if the subject is of black descent

=====Duvalierist naturalization=====
*after five years of residency, one may apply for naturalization, yet may not practice political rights until ten years after the date of naturalization. these political rights include:
**right to participate in the election of the President of the Republic
**right to defend and serve the country
**right to be elected or appointed to public office

Note: citizens over the age of 18 are entitled to civil and political rights; not all Haitians are citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Redden, (7.210.14)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Article 22: Democratic Principles====
This article is concerned with the principle of equality for all Haitians, including but not limited to freedom of speech (except during wartime), worship and peaceful assembly (excluding public assembly which must be authorized); with an overall umbrella of individual freedoms guaranteed by the state (for example, extradition for political reasons is prohibited).&lt;ref&gt;Redden, (7.210.15)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haitian society==
Haitian society has been sharply divided since its independence in 1804.  The rural agricultural sector, composing as much as 95% of the population, makes up the base of this society.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney W. Mintz, "Introduction" The Haitian People. By James G. Leyburn. (New Haven: Yale UP, 1966. v-xlviii), viii&lt;/ref&gt;  The elite are then left to dominate national institutions and the governmental apparatus.  These two sections are kept separate by income, source of income, language, education, religion, etc.  Militarism and republican nationalism formed the basis by which Haitian society was aligned, granting the elite class legitimate power.&lt;ref&gt;Plummer, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yeomanry===
They live in rural areas, are poor, and work the land for a living.  They believe in [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] so practice common law marriage, sometimes even [[polygamy]], and generally speak only Creole.  Isolated from the outside world, these poor farmers are illiterate and uneducated.  Most noticeably, they are (for the most part) darker in skin tone than the elite.&lt;ref name="Mintz, viii"&gt;Mintz, viii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle class===
The Haitian middle class is better off financially than the yeomanry and own their own businesses and attend private educational institutions and are more literate then the yeomanry.

===Elite===
This merchant and professional class dominates urban society.  They speak French as well as Creole (the national language) and are sent to institutions of higher learning abroad.  Catholicism is the principal religion, so most marriages are religiously affiliated, thus "western" and "modern."  This elite, some dark skinned but most being lighter-skinned, view themselves as aristocracy.&lt;ref name="Mintz, viii"/&gt;

==United States occupation==
{{Main|United States occupation of Haiti}}

Until 1915, Haiti followed an isolationist policy.  However, in 1915 the United States invaded Haiti and kept occupation until 1934.  During this time, interest in Haitian nationality broadened to embrace the rural majority's "black" culture.  A Haitian historical society was founded in 1924, with a focus on their history through the "Black Slave Rebellion" narrative of the Haitian Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Garrigus, 13&lt;/ref&gt;  Louverture and Dessalines became "great slave revolutionaries", showing the world the power of colonized peoples.

"By the 1970s…had begun to think of their homeland in terms that transcended mere nostalgic attachment to a particular outpost of empire.  The new… nationalism precipitates strong tensions between conservative and radical elements within local intelligentsias.  Here too, the Haitian experience of the early 1900s, with its armed conflict…Finally, the accelerated urbanization and migration experienced in Haiti, which resulted from the centralizing tendencies of the state, import-dependency, and the extreme exploitation of labor, …trends in the global economy created the impetus for a massive population exodus after World War II." &lt;ref&gt;Plummer, 246&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the US occupation, Haiti has been unable to establish an independent civilian police force as an entity separate from the army.  Every attempt to do so has resulted in a military overthrow of the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Michel S. Laguerre, The Military and Society in Haiti (Knoxville: The University of Tennessee Press, 1993), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haitian Civil-Military Relations:

*Military control for the protection of the state against foreign invaders
*Military control for the management of a crisis
*Civilian control through the demilitarization of the nation
*Civilian control through the professionalization of the army
*Civilian control through the co-optation of the arm
*Civilian control through the democratization of the army &lt;ref&gt;Laguerre, The Military and Society in Haiti, 195-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present-day citizenship==
All citizenship laws in effect today are from the [[Constitution of Haiti]] ratified in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;The Republic of Haiti. National Legislative Bodies. Constituent National Assembly. Constitution of the Republic of Haiti. 10 Mar. 1987. &lt;http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?page=search&amp;docid=3ae6b542c&amp;skip=&amp;query=haitian%20citizenship%20laws&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haitian citizenship media===

====Standing descent====
A person born in Haiti does not automatically receive citizenship.  A child, regardless of where they are born, is considered Haitian if either their mother or father is a native-born citizen of Haiti.

====Standing naturalization====
Naturalization is possible, yet can only be obtained after a continuous period of Haitian residence for five years.  A naturalized citizen has the right to vote, but is not eligible to hold public office until five years after their date of naturalization, excluding those offices reserved for native-born Haitians by Constitutional law.

===Dual citizenship===
In recent years, there has been discussion about a constitutional amendment to change Haiti's stance against [[dual nationality]]; yet while feelings have begun to lean towards acceptance of dual citizenship, policy has yet to change.  Legally, the 1987 constitution still stands, which states, "Dual Haitian and foreign nationality is in no case permitted." &lt;ref&gt;Constitution of the Republic of Haiti., Article 15&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution also automatically negates Haitian citizenship with the acquisition of foreign citizenship, which strongly affects today's Haitian diaspora.
However, there is an exception.&lt;ref&gt;Canada. Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. Country of Origin Research. 26 Mar. 2006. &lt;http://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/research/rir/?action=record.viewrec&amp;gotorec=451343&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; A child with Haitian parents born outside of Haiti may dually acquire the citizenship of their birth country.  At the age of eighteen, the child must renounce one of their nationalities.

===Grounds for withdrawing Haitian citizenship===
Article 13 of the 1987 constitution explains how Haitian citizenship can be lost.
*Acquiring citizenship of a foreign country through naturalization
*Serving a foreign government in office
*If not a native Haitian but naturalized, residing abroad for three years without authorization.  This loss is permanent
Voluntarily withdrawing citizenship must take place before the Justice Department, [[Port-au-Prince]], in Haiti.
It is not possible to reclaim citizenship lost involuntarily.

==Haitian diaspora==
{{See also|Haitian immigration to the United States and Canada}}

Transnationalism defies the common view of a state's populations remaining within its territorial boundaries.  Similarly, cultural nationality is determined by a shared language, culture, believed ethnicity, etc., transcending mere residence of a geographic locality.&lt;ref&gt;Georges E. Fouron and Nina G. Schiller, (1999) 'Terrains of Blood and Nation: Haitian Transnational Social Fields', Ethnic and Racial Studies, (22:2, 340 – 366), 342.&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of transnationalism with the development of globalization has re-framed, not destroyed, the state; institutional practices and national identities are changing to adapt to the globalization of their people.
Since the 1950s, there has been an increase in Haitian migration to places such as the United States to escape the political and economic repression of the Duvalier presidencies under [[François Duvalier]], "Papa Doc," (1957–71) and [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]], "Baby Doc," (1971–86).  This migration phenomenon known as "the Haitian Diaspora" has developed to describe the thousands of Haitian nationals living outside of their territory.  Generally losing their Haitian citizenship, these long distance nationals have come to act like "transborder citizens," members to some degree of both states.&lt;ref&gt;Georges E. Fouron and Nina G. Schiller, Georges Woke Up Laughing: Long Distance Nationalism and the Search for Home (Durham: Duke UP, 2001), 24-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are legal, political, and social repercussions to this "[[transnationalism]]."  Dual citizenship is out of the question; Haitians living in a foreign country cannot get involved lest their "Haitianism" is questioned, yet by remaining faithful to their homeland, they cannot fully enjoy the citizenry benefits of the country of their sojourn.

Haitian Americans have different status positions in American society based on their citizenship status: refugee, student (student visa), citizen, immigrant, visitor, and the undocumented person.  These legal statuses have their own boundaries, but are not subject to influence by income or race status.&lt;ref&gt;Laguerre, Disaporic Citizenship, 11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diaspora citizenship===
Citizenship practices by Haitian immigrants in the Diaspora:

*those processes linking the Diaspora to the homeland are transnational in that they move beyond the boundaries of the nation-state
*individual migrants hold membership in more than one country and continue to be active in homeland affairs
*the ‘politics of simultaneity,’ in which citizens participate in the affairs of two or more countries at the same time, replaces the ‘politics of secession’ prevalent in the dual citizenship context
*these individuals  claim or appropriate civil, political, social, and cultural rights in both countries
*they develop bi-polar or multiple identities that reflect the border-crossing process they experience in their everyday life." &lt;ref&gt;Laguerre, Disaporic Citizenship, 177&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration and citizenship institutions===
Although these institutions may have good intentions, the political and financial instability of Haiti have restricted the potential effectiveness these programs are designed to have abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Levitt and Rafael de la Dehesa, Transnational migration and the redefinition of the state: Variations and explanations. Ethnic and Racial Studies ( 26(4):587-611, 2003), 601.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Office of Diasporic Affairs: created in 1980 under [[Henri Namphy|Henry Namphy]]; moved to Office of President in 1991 under [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]]
* 10th Department Organization: elected a central committee to oversee regional Committees in cities with large Haitian immigration populations; independent yet strongly tied to Aristide's government
* Ministry for Haitians Living Abroad: established in 1994 with Aristides return to regulate the relationship between Haitians living abroad and the state&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 591&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry for Haitian Communities Abroad created a database in 2000 recording the technical skills of those Haitians residing abroad.  The idea is that Haitians' loyalty and sense of belonging to the state — even as emigrants — will impel them to contribute to Haiti's national development.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 594&lt;/ref&gt;  The emigration of these potentially productive citizens emphasized Haiti's ambivalent attitude toward the diaspora.  However, money from Haitians living abroad can be hugely beneficial; in the 1990s, Haitian remittances were equal to 39 percent of Haiti's national budget.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, 592&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noteworthy cases===
Lionel Jean-Baptiste, a Haitian immigrant, was stripped of his U.S. citizenship and then denied entrance to Haiti, his homeland.  After being held in a detention center for a [[drug-related crime]] in 2006, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that foreigners who could not be deported could not be held indefinitely, forcing the release of Baptiste.  Baptiste was not issued a Haitian passport because by becoming a naturalized American, he had renounced his Haitian citizenship and thus was no longer considered Haitian.&lt;ref&gt;Immigration Korner: Haitian immigrant released after attempts to deport him. By Felicia Persaud, in the ''New York Amsterdam News'', 28 December 2006, vol.98, issue 1, p.14-14, 1/3p&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Letters of Ayn Rand''''' is a book derived from the letters of novelist and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]], and published in 1995, 13 years after her death. It was edited by Michael Berliner with the approval of Rand's estate.

==Background==
When Rand died in 1982, the materials in her estate included copies of over 2000 letters written by her between 1926 and 1981. Berliner selected "approximately 35 to 40 percent of the total" for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1995|p=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also edited the letters to remove "less interesting material", such as opening and closing statements or apologies by Rand for not writing someone sooner after they had written her.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1995|pp=xvi–xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing the letters in the context of a later controversy over the editing of Rand's published [[Journals of Ayn Rand|journals]], historian Jennifer Burns affirmed that Berliner had only omitted material rather than changed the content.&lt;ref name="burns"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right]] |last=Burns |first=Jennifer |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-532487-7 |oclc=313665028 |page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hardcover edition of ''Letters of Ayn Rand'' was published by [[E. P. Dutton|Dutton]] in 1995. A paperback edition was published by [[Plume (publishing)|Plume]] in 1997.

==Contents==
The organization of the letters is largely chronological, but specific sections are dedicated to Rand's correspondence with [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Isabel Paterson]] and [[John Hospers]]. An appendix provides a form letter that Rand sent to many fans of ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' who had written her. Rand's heir, [[Leonard Peikoff]], provides an introduction.

==Reception==
At the time of its release, about a dozen publications reviewed ''Letters of Ayn Rand'', according to the [[Ayn Rand Institute]]. The reviews were mixed.&lt;ref name="annual"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berliner |first=Michael S. |title=Ayn Rand in Review |work=Archives Annual |volume=3 |year=2000 |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/DocServer/volume3.pdf |page=23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622052015/http://www.aynrand.org/site/DocServer/volume3.pdf |archivedate=June 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', [[Christopher Cox]], then a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]], gave the book a positive review. He said Rand's letters were "an important part of Ayn Rand's intellectual contribution" that are "filled with flashes of emotional insight, surprising facts and unintended humor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cox |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Cox |title=Behind The Fountainhead |work=[[The New York Times Book Review]] |date=August 6, 1995 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first positive review of one of Rand's books in ''The New York Times Book Review'' since 1943.&lt;ref name="annual"/&gt;

Another positive review came from Rand scholar [[Chris Matthew Sciabarra]]. Writing in ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine, he predicted that Rand's letters would "delight and sometimes shock readers", and said "what is most startling about the collection is how well it humanizes Ayn Rand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sciabarra |first=Chris Matthew |authorlink=Chris Matthew Sciabarra |url=http://reason.com/archives/1995/11/01/rand-the-living |title=Rand the Living |work=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |volume=27 |issue=6 |date=November 1995 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Liberty (1987)|Liberty]]'' magazine editor [[R.W. Bradford]] found the book interesting and said it "allows the reader to see glimpses of the real woman and her development as a thinker and writer."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bradford|1995|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he described Berliner's editing as "inept"&lt;ref name="bradford54"&gt;{{harvnb|Bradford|1995|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Peikoff's introduction as "uninformative".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bradford|1995|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said Rand wrote relatively few letters for a significant literary figure, and suggested Berliner held back potentially interesting letters for fear of upsetting Rand's "self-made myth," which Bradford considered "inexcusable".&lt;ref name="bradford54"/&gt;

In ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Jeffrey Frank]] described the book as "ultimately tedious". He said her earlier letters are "considerably more interesting than the later ones", which include "an endless amount of whining about various publishers, her detailed responses to editors' suggestions, her hectoring assertions of her beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeffrey A. |last=Frank |authorlink=Jeffrey Frank |title=The Virtues of Selfishness |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=July 9, 1995 |page=WBK4 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/6855809.html?FMT=ABS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[National Review]]'', [[Florence King]] said the "book reeks of the sycophancy that Miss Rand always inspired" and noted several letters attacking the ''National Review'' itself, "the magazine she loved to hate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Florence |last=King |authorlink=Florence King |title=Scud Missives |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/king/king200405280928.asp |work=[[National Review]] |date=October 9, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] magazines praised the book, with one saying, "in her letters we learn more of the style of her soul",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Donald |last=Heath |title=Correspondence to Reality |url=http://www.objectivistcenter.org/showcontent.aspx?ct=36 |work=IOS Journal |date=September 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another called the book "the next best thing" to knowing Rand personally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garmong |first=Dina |title=An Intimate View of a Titan |journal=[[The Intellectual Activist]] |date=September 1995 |volume=9 |issue=5 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review for the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'', Scott Holleran called the book "a treasure chest" in which "Rand emerges as a passionate thinker".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Holleran |title=Rand's Letters Offer Glimpse of Greatness |work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |date=December 17, 1995 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-25030258.html}}{{Subscription required|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reviews included a review by [[Claudia Roth Pierpont]] in ''[[The New Yorker]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Claudia Roth |last=Pierpont |authorlink=Claudia Roth Pierpont |title=Twilight of the Goddess |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=July 24, 1995 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1995/07/24/1995_07_24_070_TNY_CARDS_000370859}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reviews in ''[[Booklist]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Winters |first=Dennis |title=Review |work=Booklist |volume=91 |date=June 1, 1995 |page=1720 |url=http://booklistonline.com/ProductInfo.aspx?pid=982841}}{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Overmyer |first=J. |title=Review |work=[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice]] |volume=33 |date=February 1996 |page=952}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jere |last=Real |title=Ayn Rand Stood by Principles |work=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]] |date=August 6, 1995 |page=F4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand scholars writing about the book some years later also expressed mixed opinions. [[Mimi Reisel Gladstein]] complimented the "uncommon variety of letters" included, saying it "allows the reader access to the many facets of Rand's private and public personae."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she noted a mistake regarding Rand's birthday at the beginning of the book, and included it among several posthumous books approved by Rand's estate that "have not always exhibited a confidence-inspiring level of academic rigor."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer Burns said scholars can use the material in the book, but indicated the material omitted by Berliner includes items "of high interest to the historian" so that "important insights can be gleaned only from the originals."&lt;ref name="burns"/&gt;

:{{ref label|TearingDate|C2|C2}} '''Tearing Ledge''' The wreck is believed to be the Romney, one of four ships lost on 22 October 1707&lt;ref name="Fenwick" /&gt;
:{{ref label|RillCoveDate|C3|C3}} '''Rill Cove Wreck''': the identity of the wreck has not been determined. The tentative date of 1616 is based on the dates of artefacts recovered.&lt;ref name="Fenwick" /&gt;
:{{ref label|Coronation|C4|C4}} '''Coronation''': the wreck of the Coronation is thought to be split into two sites - the [[Kennemerland (ship)|Kennemerland]] also split into two sites when wrecked. The identity of the offshore site (site 17) was confirmed by finding a plate inscribed with the family crest of the Captain. The identity of the inshore site (site 33) is more controversial. Royal Naval Guns found on the inshore site are consistent with a first or second rate ship of the line of the correct period and there is no other record of a ship of her size foundering in the area.&lt;ref name="ACHW2005" /&gt;
:{{ref label|Bartholomew|C5|C5}} '''Barthomolew Ledges''': it is possible that the wreck is that of the Spanish vessel, ''San Bartholome'' which was wrecked in 1597, although this vessel is not recorded as being lost in the Isles of Scilly.&lt;ref name="Fenwick" /&gt; The wreck is late 16th century and was carrying lead ingots of a Spanish type. Six recovered coins date between 1474 and 1555, hence dating the wreck after 1555.&lt;ref name="ACHW2005" /&gt;
:{{ref label|Diamond|C6|C6}} '''The Diamond''': the wreck is of an early type of composite hull and was initially thought to be the Diamond. The current licensee has identified several anomalies in this identification, including that the wreck appears to be longer than the Diamond; there are discrepancies between samples of materials recovered from the wreck and those listed as being used in the construction of the Diamond, and artefacts patented after the date of sinking have been recovered.&lt;ref name="ACHW2005" /&gt;

The catalogue of [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany]] (Lord Dunsany)'s work during his 52-year active writing career is quite extensive, and is fraught with pitfalls for two reasons: first, many of Dunsany's original books of collected short stories were later followed by reprint collections, some of which were unauthorised and included only previously published stories; and second, some later collections bore titles very similar to different original books.

In 1993, [[S. T. Joshi]] and [[Darrell Schweitzer]] released a bibliographic volume which, while emphasising that it makes no claim to be the final word, gives considerable information on Dunsany's work. They noted that a "ledger" of at least some of Dunsany's work was thought to have existed at [[Dunsany Castle]].  It is believed that the curator at Dunsany Castle has compiled considerable writing and publication data.

The following is a partial list compiled from various sources.

The '''''Madonna of the Book''''', or the '''''Madonna del Libro''''', is a small painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] artist [[Sandro Botticelli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/sandro-botticelli|title=Sandro Botticelli|publisher=www.nationalgallery.org.uk|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://universalium.academic.ru/237120/Botticelli,_Sandro|title=Botticelli,_Sandro|publisher=/universalium.academic.ru|accessdate= November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is preserved in the [[Museo Poldi Pezzoli|Poldi Pezzoli Museum]] in Milan. The painting is executed in [[tempera]] on panel. It dates from between 1480 and 1483.&lt;ref name="museupoldi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museopoldipezzoli.it/en/node/631 |title=Madonna of the Book |publisher=www.museopoldipezzoli.it|accessdate=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Malaguzzi|Botticelli|2004|page=40}}

==Description==
The ''Madonna of the Book'' is a soft and elegant work, in which [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and the [[Child Jesus|Child]] are seated by a window in the corner of a room. She holds a [[Book of Hours]], the Horae Beatae Mariae Virginis, prayer books for laymen common in the thirteenth to sixteenth centuries. The infant is gazing at his mother whilst she is absorbed in reading the book. The hands of both mother and son are positioned similarly, with the right hands open as in a gesture of blessing, and left hands closed.&lt;ref name="museupoldi"/&gt;
 
Symbolizing the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]], the Christ Child is holding the three [[Nail (relic)|nails]] of the [[Christian cross|cross]], and the [[crown of thorns]]. These are probably later additions, added to make the message more explicit.&lt;ref name="milano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GCI"/&gt; This is the conventional representation in the Christian [[iconography]]. In addition, the fruit in the bowl has an emblematic meaning. The [[cherry|cherries]] represent the [[blood of Christ]] or are an allusion to Paradise, [[plum]]s indicate the tenderness between Mary and the Child, and the [[Common fig|figs]] are characteristic of the Resurrection.&lt;ref name="museupoldi"/&gt;

Mary's blue robe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/questions/faq/faq12.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904024808/http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/questions/faq/faq12.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-09-04 |title=The Dayton University - The Marian Library International Marian research Institute |publisher=campus.udayton.edu |accessdate=November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a color she is often depicted wearing, has the symbolic meanings of purity, heaven, and royalty.&lt;ref name="madonna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madonnaandchild.wordpress.com/jasons-essay/|title=Madonna and Child /The artist here depicts Mary clad in her trademark blue robe. Mary is often portrayed wearing blue because blue represents purity, the virgin birth, and was often a color of royalty. /|publisher=madonnaandchild.wordpress.com|accessdate=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artelisaart.blogspot.se/2012/03/famous-blue-history-of-color-in-middle.html|title=The famous blue. The history-of-color|publisher=artelisaart.blogspot.se|accessdate=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|"blue as divine wisdom and contemplation, things heavenly .... joys of heavenly existence ... colors represent purity of the soul, the sins of humanity washed clean with blood of love (the sacrifice on the cross)&lt;ref name="madonna"/&gt;}} In this painting, as in Botticelli's other large series, the Madonna is portrayed as being serious, thoughtful and focused.&lt;ref name="artble"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artble.com/artists/sandro_botticelli|title=artists/sandro_botticelli|publisher=www.artble.com|accessdate=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|"In Botticelli's major early works (Fortitude and St. Sebastian) he changes the appearance of muscular energy and physical action as found in Verrocchio's work. The characters in Botticelli's work are displayed as melancholy and thoughtful."&lt;ref name="artble"/&gt;}}
&lt;!-- A more intellectual relationship between mother and son, rather than a loving one, so unlike the works painted by [[Raphael|Raphael Sanzio]], in which often she looks at her child smiling.&lt;ref name="museupoldi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://totallyhistory.com/madonna-and-child-with-the-book/|title=Madonna and Child with the Book, by Raphael Sanzio|publisher=totallyhistory.com|accessdate= November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Botticelli interprets the scene with a sensitivity and love for small details: the set of boxes and the [[maiolica]] bowl of lush fruits are depicted as a [[still life]]; the pages of the book, the garments, and the transparent veils exhibit a realistic tactile quality.&lt;ref name="Gallery"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/b/botticel/22/2libro.html |first1=Emil |last1=Krén |first2=Daniel |last2=Marx |publisher=Web Gallery of Art |title=Madonna of the Book (Madonna del Libro) |accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composition is refined with a good balance. Botticelli painted with subtle differences in colour, and he was able to put colours together so that they complement each other admirably. The painting is adorned with gold [[filigree]] decorating the clothes and objects. The use of gold was the result of the contractual agreement he made with the commissioner, and was included in the price of the painting.&lt;ref name="GCI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/the-virgin-and-child-the-madonna-of-the-book/cgHULpr5dnz9JA?hl=en#!asset-viewer:l.id=cgHULpr5dnz9JA&amp;hl=en|title=The Virgin and Child (The Madonna of the Book)1480 |publisher=[[Google Cultural Institute]] |accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallery"/&gt;{{efn-ua|"Known also as the Madonna of the Book, this painting represents the Virgin and Child in a domestic setting, intent on reading a volume, perhaps a Book of Hours. A window is open on the landscape at twilight, but the diffused light which transforms the space into a mystical setting seems to emanate from the figures themselves.}}&lt;ref name="museupoldi"/&gt; Dating from about 1480, the painting shows all the elements of Botticelli's mature poetic style: a delicate, elegant linearity, a style which is still far from the intense pathos of his late work."&lt;ref name="GCI"/&gt;  The identity of his patron is unknown.{{sfn|Malaguzzi|Botticelli|2004|page=40}}

The interrelationship of light, shapes and voids confers an ethereal quality to the work.{{efn-ua|"The glimmer which pervades them seems to be unleashed by these figures and it spreads throughout the surrounding spaces. Besides the light, even the pyramid-like layout of the two sacred figures feeds the perception of an absolutely perfect moment."&lt;ref name="milano"/&gt;}} Indeed, the painting might be considered as newly rediscovered, as a recent restoration revealed a luminescent sky and bright morning aura, which had been obscured by layers of centuries-old varnish.&lt;ref name="Backus"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lagazzettadelmezzogiorno.it/GdM_traduci_notizia.php?IDNotizia=386348&amp;IDCategotia= |title=Botticelli exhibit unveils surprises for art scholars: Show at Milan's Poldi Pezzoli museum gathers eight key works |first1=Emily |last1=Backus |newspaper=[[La Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno]] |location=Milan |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=4 November 2014 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Onuchina"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artinvestment.ru/en/news/exhibitions/20110104_boticelli_milan.html |title=Eight masterpieces by Botticelli in Milan |date=1 April 2011 |first1=Maria |last1=Onuchina |publisher=ARTinvestment.RU |accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
One is reminded of other Marian images made prior to the year 1470. Botticelli might have been influenced by [[Filippo Lippi]]'s ''Madonna and Child with an Angel'' from the [[Ospedale degli Innocenti|Hospital of the Innocents]] in Florence.&lt;ref name="museupoldi"/&gt; &lt;!-- The painting has a rectangular shape, which is rare in the later production of Botticelli in the 1470s. --&gt;

Botticelli and the ''Madonna of the Book'' were the subject of renewed interest in the 19th century. In its "extraordinary beauty" it appealed to Italians in particular who saw in it a source of national identity, during Italian unification ("[[Risorgimento]]").&lt;ref name="Sidney"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sydney.edu.au/news/84.html?newsstoryid=8813 |title=New light on Botticelli's beauty: Discoveries at the Poldi Pezzoli Museum, Milan |date=13 March 2012 |publisher=[[University of Sydney]] |accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Botticelli's admirers was [[Gian Giacomo Poldi Pezzoli]], who bequeathed his private collection and his apartment to the public.&lt;ref name="Sidney"/&gt;  Dr Annalisa Zanni, the Poldi Pezzoli Museum director, recently discovered more about Botticelli's technique and use of materials, as exemplified in the ''Madonna of the Book''. For example, she discovered that Botticelli's top layer of blue was [[lapis lazuli]], a "very precious and very expensive ingredient, indicating it was commissioned by a highly prestigious patron".&lt;ref name="Backus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Onuchina"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sidney"/&gt;

'''Mid-Atlantic American English''', '''Middle Atlantic American English''', or '''Delaware Valley English''' is a class of [[American English]], considered by ''[[The Atlas of North American English]]'' to be a single dialect,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; spoken in the southern [[Mid-Atlantic states]] of the [[United States]] (i.e. the [[Delaware Valley]], [[southeastern Pennsylvania]], [[South Jersey]], [[Delaware]], and [[Maryland]]). 

The dialect consists mainly of the widely studied subsets known as [[Philadelphia English]] and [[Baltimore English]].

This dialect of English centers most strongly around [[Philadelphia]] and [[Reading, Pennsylvania]]; [[Wilmington, Delaware]]; [[Baltimore, Maryland]]; and [[Atlantic City]] and [[Trenton, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mid-Atlantic dialectal region is characterized by several unique phonological features:
*No [[cot-caught merger]]: There is a huge difference in the pronunciation between the ''cot'' class of words (e.g. ''pot'', ''glob'', and ''rock'') and the ''caught'' class (e.g. ''thought'', ''awe'', and ''call''), as in New York City.&lt;ref name="p125"&gt;{{Harvp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''caught'' class is raised and diphthongized towards {{IPA|[oə]~[o̝ə]}}.&lt;ref name="p130"&gt;{{Harvp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Lot-cloth split]]: Similarly, the single word "on" has the vowel of "dawn", and not the same vowel as "don" etc. Labov et al. regard this phenomenon as occurring not just in the Mid-Atlantic region, but in all regions south of a geographic boundary that they identify as the "ON line", which is significant because it distinguishes most varieties of [[Northern American English]] (in which ''on'' and ''Don'' are closer rhymes) from most varieties of [[Midland American English|Midland]] and [[Southern American English]] (in which ''on'' and ''dawn'' are closer rhymes).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[/æ/-tensing#Philadelphia and Baltimore|Short-''a'' split system]]: The Mid-Atlantic region uses a short-''a'' split system similar to, but more limited than, the New York City short-''a'' split system. (In the [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] area, an intermediate system is used, falling between the typical Mid-Atlantic and the New York City system.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, in the Mid-Atlantic system, the vowel {{IPAc-en|æ}} is [[tenseness|tensed]] (towards {{IPA|[eə]}}) before the consonants {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/s/}}, and {{IPA|/θ/}} in a [[closed syllable]] (so, for example, ''bats'' and ''baths'' do not have the same vowel sound, being pronounced {{IPA|[bæts]}} and {{IPA|[beəθs]}}, respectively), and in any words directly inflectionally derived from root words with this split. Therefore, ''pass'' and ''passing'' use the tense {{IPA|[eə]}}, but ''passage'' and ''passive'' use the lax {{IPA|[æ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lax and the tense reflexes of {{IPA|/æ/}} are separate phonemes in these dialects, though largely predictable using the aforementioned rules. There are exceptions, however; the three words ''bad, mad,'' and ''glad'' become tense, and irregular verbs ending in "-an" or "-am" remain lax.&lt;ref name="ch17"&gt;{{Harvp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|loc=chpt. 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; See ''[[/æ/-tensing#Philadelphia and Baltimore]]'' or click "show" below for more details.

*To refer to a sweetened, flavored, carbonated [[soft drink]], the term ''soda'' is preferred (rather than ''pop'' or the generic ''coke'').
*[[Positive anymore]] may be used without its negative polarity to mean "nowadays," as in "Her hoagies taste different anymore."
*The term ''[[wikt:jimmy#Noun|jimmies]]'' is sometimes used in this and the Boston dialect to refer to small confectionaries used to top ice cream and icing, normally called "sprinkles" in New York and the rest of the United States.

'''''Moko''''' are [[bronze]] [[kettledrum]]s from [[Alor Island]], Indonesia,While they have been found in several different locations in [[Indonesia]], they are most famously associated with the island of [[Alor Island|Alor]], where they have long been prized in ceremonial exchanges. Later moko were made in [[China]] and [[Java]] and were brought to Alor in the 19th century.

Some scholars identify the design and decorations have their likely origin in [[Dong Son, Thanh Hoa|Đông Sơn]] the centre of the [[Đông Sơn culture]] in [[Vietnam]]. However, it remains a mystery as to how the older [[Dong Son drums|Đông Sơn drums]] arrived in Alor. Local origin stories describe the discovery of mokos buried in the ground, and it is still common to hear of moko being uncovered in this way. In ''The  People of Alor,''&lt;ref&gt;Du Bois, Cora Alice. 1960. The people of Alor; a social-psychological study of an East Indian island. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; American anthropologist [[Cora Du Bois]] describes people burying mokos in hidden locations to avoid surrendering them to creditors or lending them to relatives.

Moko remain important symbols of status and are particularly important is their ritual value. Moko are still generally required as part of the bridal dowry, though the short supply of moko today means that moko must often be borrowed or mortgaged for this purpose.

The '''Monteleone chariot''' is an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[chariot]] dated to c. 530 BC, considered one of the world's great archaeological finds. It was originally uncovered at [[Monteleone di Spoleto]] and is currently a star attraction in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/247020?sortBy=Relevance&amp;amp;ft=monteleone&amp;amp;offset=0&amp;amp;rpp=20&amp;amp;pos=5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Etruscan chariot wheel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Close up on the wheel of the chariot.]]
The Monteleone chariot was part of a [[chariot burial]], containing the remains of two human corpses, along with two drinking cups. Measuring 131&amp;nbsp;cm in height and designed to be drawn by two horses, the chariot itself is constructed of wood covered with hammered bronze plates and carved ivory decoration. The bronze plates are decorated with Homeric iconography; the main panel depicts [[Achilles]] being handed his armor by his mother, [[Thetis]]. The chariot's frame and plating is additionally adorned with animals and mythological creatures, rendered in detail. The chariot's decorations would also have included inlaid amber and other exotic materials, but only the bronze and ivory decorations have survived. The chariot's wheels have nine [[spoke]]s (rather than the classical Greek four, the Egyptian six, or the Assyrian and Persian eight; excavated chariots from Celtic burials have up to twelve spokes).

Contemporary curators at the Museum had long suspected that the chariot's original 1903 reconstruction was not historically accurate. In 1989, under the direction of Italian archaeologist [[Adriana Emiliozzi]], the Metropolitan Museum began a five-year reexamination and restoration of the chariot. During the restoration, it was discovered that the chariot had in fact been originally assembled incorrectly; additionally, evidence was uncovered indicating that the chariot, previously thought to have seen little actual use, had in fact been involved in a serious accident at some point during its life.&lt;ref name=nytimes1&gt;{{cite news|last=Vogel|first=Carol|title=A More Precise Version of Your Chariot Awaits|publisher=The New York Times|date=2007-03-29|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/29/arts/design/29char.html?ex=1332820800&amp;en=accf307e2331452e&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss|accessdate=2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly restored chariot's reinstallation was scheduled as part of the major renovations of the Metropolitan Museum's Greek and Roman galleries, opening to the public on April 20, 2007.

==History==
[[File:Bronze chariot inlaid with ivory MET DP137936.jpg|thumb|250px|Monteleone chariot]]
[[File:Bronze chariot inlaid with ivory MET DP137946.jpg|thumb|250px|]]
It was found in 1902 in [[Monteleone di Spoleto]], near [[Spoleto]] in the [[Provinces_of_Italy#Kingdom_of_Italy|province]] of [[Umbria]], by a farmer named Isidoro Vannozzi who inadvertently unearthed it while digging a wine cellar or basement barn. Its history from that time is the subject of controversy. According to some accounts, Vannozzi hid the chariot in his barn, concerned that the authorities might confiscate it, and later sold it to two Frenchmen in exchange for two cows. Another account, related by Vannozzi's son Giuseppe, holds that the chariot was immediately sold as scrap metal, and the proceeds from the sale used to buy roof tiles.&lt;ref name=nytimes2&gt;{{cite news|last=Povoledo|first=Elisabetta|title=Umbrian Umbrage: Send Back That Etruscan Chariot|publisher=The New York Times|date=2007-04-05|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/05/arts/design/05char.html?ex=1333425600&amp;en=2b186de026816a09&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss|accessdate=2007-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing hands several times after its initial sale, the chariot was eventually purchased in Paris by [[J. P. Morgan]], who sent it to the Metropolitan Museum in 1903, where its first restoration took place.

Because the museum's acquisition of the chariot in 1903 predates by six years Italy's first laws restricting export of items that carry "cultural and artistic values," the chariot's sale was legal at the time of purchase, though debated by the contemporary press.&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="patrimoniosos1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Galli|first=Paola|title=Cultural assets for sale.

The Metropolitan Museum has responded that the chariot was "purchased in good faith".&lt;ref name="nytimes2" /&gt;  A full-size copy was made in the mid-20th century, which is on display in Monteleone.

The connection between '''music and politics''', particularly political expression in song, has been seen in many cultures. Although music influences political movements and rituals, it is not clear how or to what extent general audiences relate to music on a political level.&lt;ref name="Polpop"/&gt; Music can express [[anti-establishment]] or protest themes, including [[anti-war song]]s, but pro-establishment ideas are also represented, for example, in national anthems, patriotic songs, and political campaigns. Many of these types of songs could be described as [[topical song]]s.

Songs can be used to portray a specific political message. However, there may be barriers to the transmission of such messages; even overtly political songs are often shaped by and reference their contemporary political context, making an understanding of the history and events that inspired the music necessary in order to fully comprehend the message. The nature of that message can also be ambiguous because the label "political music" can be applied either to songs that merely observe political subjects, songs which offer a partisan opinion, or songs which go further and advocate for specific political action. Thus a distinction has been made, for example, between the use of music as a tool for raising awareness, and music as advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140714161257/http://livingearth.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/CASE-STUDY-OF-MUSIC-AS-A-TOOL-FOR-ADVOCACY-AND-AWARENESS-RAISING.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, some forms of music may be deemed political by cultural association, irrespective of political content, as evidenced by the way [[Western culture|Western]] pop/rock bands such as [[The Beatles]] were censored by the [[State (polity)|State]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]] in the 1960s and 1970s, while being embraced by younger people as symbolic of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neweasterneurope.eu/columns-blogs/new-voices/855-back-in-the-ussr |title=New Eastern Europe |website=Neweasterneurope.eu |date=2012-11-29 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This points to the possibilities for discrepancy between the political intentions of musicians (if any), and reception of their music by wider society. Conversely, there is the possibility of the meaning of deliberate political content being missed by its intended audience,  reasons for which could include obscurity or delivery of message, or audience indifference or antipathy.

It is difficult to predict how audiences will respond to political music, in terms of aural or even visual cues.&lt;ref name="Polpop"/&gt; For example, Bleich and Zillmann found that "counter to expectations, highly rebellious students did not enjoy defiant rock videos more than did their less rebellious peers, nor did they consume more defiant rock music than did their peers",&lt;ref name="Polpop"&gt;{{cite web|last=alio|first=nur|title=Political Pop, Political Fans?|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/mp/9460447.0004.103?view=text;rgn=main|publisher=Music &amp; Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting there may be little connection between behaviour and musical taste. Pedelty and Keefe argue that "It is not clear to what extent the political messages in and around music motivate fans, become a catalyst for discussion, [or] function aesthetically".

However, in contrast they cite research that concludes, based on interpretive readings of lyrics and performances with a strong emphasis on historical contexts and links to social groups, that "given the right historical circumstances, cultural conditions, and aesthetic qualities, popular music can help bring people together to form effective political communities".&lt;ref name="Polpop"/&gt;

Recent research has also suggested that in many schools around the world, including in modern democratic nations, [[music education]] has sometimes been used for the ideological purpose of instilling [[patriotism]] in children, and that particularly during wartime patriotic singing can escalate to inspire destructive [[jingoism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David and Kertz-Welzel, Alexandra (2012).''Patriotism and Nationalism in Music Education''. Aldershot, UK: Ashgate Press {{ISBN|1409430804}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Plato wrote: "musical innovation is full of danger to the whole state, and ought to be prohibited. When modes of music change, the fundamental laws of the state always change with them;"{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} although this was written as a warning this can be taken as a revolutionary statement that music is much more than just melodies and harmonies but a much more important movement in the life of all human beings.

==Folk music==

===American folk revival===
The song "[[We Shall Overcome]]" is perhaps the best-known example of political [[folk music]], in this case a rallying-cry for the [[US]] [[Civil Rights Movement]]. [[Pete Seeger]] was involved in the popularisation of the song, as was [[Joan Baez]].&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Noah|title=The History of 'We Shall Overcome'|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1031839|accessdate=17 February 2012|date=15 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early part of the 20th century, poor working conditions and [[class struggle]] lead to the growth of the [[Labour movement]] and numerous songs advocating social and political reform. The most famous songwriter of the early 20th century "[[Wobblies]]" was [[Joe Hill]]. Later, from the 1940s through the 1960s, groups like the [[Almanac Singers]] and [[The Weavers]] were influential in reviving this type of socio-political music. [[Woody Guthrie]]'s "This Land Is Your Land" is one of the most famous American folk songs and its lyrics exemplify Guthrie's [[socialism|socialistic]] patriotism.&lt;ref name="Folk Hero"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hajdu|first=David|title=Review: Folk Hero|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/03/29/040329crbo_books?currentPage=1.|accessdate=13 March 2012|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=29 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pete Seeger's "[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]", was a popular anti-war [[protest song]].&lt;ref name="Pete Seeger"&gt;{{cite web|last=PBS|title=The Power of Song|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/pete-seeger/the-power-of-song/50/|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these types of songs became popular during the Vietnam War era. "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]", by [[Bob Dylan]], was a hit for [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], and suggested that a younger generation was becoming more aware of global problems than many of the older generation.&lt;ref name="dissentmagazine.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/the-political-bob-dylan |title=The Political Bob Dylan |publisher=Dissent Magazine |date=2016-11-13 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Joan Baez had a top-ten hit in the UK&lt;ref name="Top Hits 1965"&gt;{{cite web|title=Favorites in the UK 1965|url=http://www.severing.nu/music/1965UK.html|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with "[[There but for Fortune (song)|There but for Fortune]]" (by [[Phil Ochs]]); it was a plea for the innocent victim of prejudice or inhumane policies.&lt;ref name=Unterberger&gt;{{cite web|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|title=There But for Fortune|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/there-but-for-fortune-t1020598|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many topical songwriters with social and political messages emerged from the [[American folk music revival|folk music revival]] of the 1960s, including Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Phil Ochs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/philochs2.html |title=Perfect Sound Forever: Phil Ochs |website=Furious.com |date=1976-04-09 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Paxton]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], [[Judy Collins]], [[Arlo Guthrie]], and others.

The folk revival can be considered as a political re-invention of traditional song, a development encouraged by [[Left-wing politics|Left]]-leaning folk record labels and magazines such as [[Sing Out!]] and [[Broadside (magazine)|Broadside]]. The revival began in the 1930s&lt;ref name="30s to 60s folk music revival"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eyerman and Barretta|first=Ron and Scott|title=From the 30s to the 60s: The folk music revival in the United States|url=http://web.uni-frankfurt.de/fb09/kunstpaed/indexweb/jukult/folk.pdf|publisher=Springer|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued after [[World War II]]. Folk songs of this time gained popularity by using old hymns and songs but adapting the lyrics to fit the current social and political conditions.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 508&lt;/ref&gt; Archivists and artists such as [[Alan Lomax]], [[Lead Belly]] and Woody Guthrie were crucial in popularising folk music, and the latter began to be known as the Lomax singers.&lt;ref name=Reuss&gt;{{cite book|last=Reuss and Reuss|first=Richard and Joanne|title=American Folk Music and Left Wing Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EycS7FSTAyUC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=folk+topical+recordings+left+wing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y2GOBM-opV&amp;sig=oobIuBpQghNCnp3f2Al21JaMWj8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rj1_T6jwI4Sk8gS09KjNBw&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=folk%20topical%20recordings%20left%20wing&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an era of folk music in which some artists and their songs expressed clear political messages with the intention of swaying public opinion and recruiting support.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 502&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[UK]], [[Ewan MacColl]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewanmaccoll.co.uk/ewan-maccoll-biography/ |title=Ewan MacColl Biography |website=Ewanmaccoll.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[A. L. Lloyd]] performed similar roles, with Lloyd as folklorist&lt;ref&gt;Lee, CP (2009), 'Like the night: Reception and reaction, Dylan's 1966 UK tour', in: ''Highway 61 Revisited: Bob Dylan's Road From Minnesota To The World'', University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis USA, pp. 78-84.&lt;/ref&gt; and MacColl (often with [[Peggy Seeger]]) releasing dozens of albums which blended traditional songs with newer political material influenced by their [[CPGB|Communist]] activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ewan-maccoll.info/AlbumInfo.aspx?ID=239 |title=Peggy Seeger and Ewan MacColl - Songs Of Struggle |website=Ewan-maccoll.info |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Neil Spencer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/25/ewan-maccoll-godfather-folk-adored-and-feared |title=Ewan MacColl: the godfather of folk who was adored – and feared &amp;#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Colin Irwin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/apr/23/british-folk-music |title=The battle over British folk music &amp;#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later, post-war revival, folk music found a new audience with college students, partly since universities provided the organisation necessary for sustaining music trends and an expanded, impressionable audience looking to rebel against the older generation.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 522&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the rhetoric of the United States government during the [[Cold War]] era was very powerful and in some ways overpowered the message of folk artists, such as in relation to public opinion regarding Communist-backed political causes. Various Gallup Polls that were conducted during this time suggest that Americans consistently saw Communism as a threat; for example, a 1954 poll shows that at the time 51% of Americans said that admitted Communists should be arrested, and in relation to music 64% of respondents said that if a radio singer is an admitted Communist he should be fired.&lt;ref name="Cold War Gallup"&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=John|title=Seeing Red: The Cold War and American Public Opinion|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/foreign-policy/cold-war/conference/white.html|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading figures in the American folk revival such as Seeger, [[Earl Robinson]] and [[Irwin Silber]] were or had been members of the [[CPUSA|Communist Party]], while others such as Guthrie (who had written a column for CPUSA magazine [[New Masses]]), [[Lee Hays]] and [[Paul Robeson]] were considered [[Fellow travellers#McCarthyism|fellow travellers]]. As [[McCarthyism]] began to dominate the United States population and government, it was more difficult for folk artists to travel and perform since folk was pushed out of mainstream music.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996 p. 520&lt;/ref&gt; Artists were blacklisted, denounced by [[House Committee on Un-American Activities#Standing committee|politicians]] and the media, and in the case of the 1949 [[Peekskill Riots]], subject to mob attack.

In general, the significance of lyrics within folk music reduced as it became influenced by [[rock and roll]].&lt;ref name="Folk Music 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=James|first=David|title=The Vietnam War and American Music|journal=Social Text|year=1989|pages=122–143|jstor=466424}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the popular folk revival's last phase in the early 1960s, new folk artists such as Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs began writing their own, original topical music, as opposed to mainly adapting traditional folksong.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 528&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blues and black American music===
Blues songs have the reputation of being resigned to fate rather than fighting against misfortune, but there have been exceptions. [[Bessie Smith]] recorded protest song "Poor Man Blues" in 1928. [[Josh White]] recorded "When Am I Going to be Called a Man" in 1936 – at this time it was common for white men to address black men as "boy" – before releasing two albums of explicitly political material, 1940's ''Chain Gang'' and 1941's ''Southern Exposure: An Album of Jim Crow Blues''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elijahwald.com/joshprotest.html |title=Josh White and the Protest Blues, by Elijah Wald |website=Elijahwald.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead Belly's "Bourgeois Blues" and [[Big Bill Broonzy]]'s "Black, Brown and White" (aka "Get Back") protested racism. [[Billie Holiday]] recorded and popularised the song "[[Strange Fruit]]" in 1939. Written by Communist [[Lewis Allan]], and also recorded by Josh White and [[Nina Simone]], it addressed [[Southern United States|Southern]] racism, specifically the lynching of African-Americans, and was performed as a protest song in New York venues, including [[Madison Square Gardens]]. In the post-war era, [[J.B. Lenoir]] gained a reputation for political and social comment; his record label pulled the planned release of 1954 single "Eisenhower Blues" due to its title&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bill Dahl |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jb-lenoir-mn0000115733/biography |title=J.B. Lenoir &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later material protested civil rights, racism and the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Schwachter |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/vietnam-blues-the-complete-l-r-recording-mw0000178679 |title=Vietnam Blues: The Complete L&amp;R Recording - J.B. Lenoir &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Lee Hooker also sang 'I Don't Wanna Go To Vietnam" on 1969 album ''Simply the Truth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/John-Lee-Hooker-Simply-The-Truth/master/417087 |title=John Lee Hooker - Simply The Truth |website=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Robeson, singer, actor, athlete, and civil rights activist, was investigated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and was called before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) for his outspoken [[Political views of Paul Robeson|political views]]. The [[State Department]] denied Robeson a passport and issued a "stop notice" at all ports, effectively confining him to the United States. In a symbolic act of defiance against the travel ban, labour unions in the U.S. and Canada organised a concert at the International [[Peace Arch]] on the border between [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state and the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]] on May 18, 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; Robeson stood on the back of a flat bed truck on the U.S. side of the border and performed a concert for a crowd on the Canadian side, variously estimated at between 20,000 and 40,000 people. He returned to perform a second concert at the Peace Arch in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;Duberman p. 411&lt;/ref&gt; and over the next two years two further concerts were scheduled.

[[Disco music|Disco]], contrary to popular opinion, originated in [[Black people|Black]] [[queer]] communities and offered these communities a form of salvation or safe haven from social turmoil during the 1970s, in the [[Bronx]] and other parts of [[New York City|New York]]. It was agreed by many members prominent in the Disco scene that the music was about love and the vitality of "absorbing the feeling", but the question regarding its political import received mixed responses. Although the songs themselves may not have explicitly made political claims, it's important to note that disco, for many, was a "form of escape" and noted a "dissolve of restrictions on black/gay people".&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, Tim ''Disco and the Queering of the Dance Floor.'', Cultural Studies, 25:2, 230-243, DOI: 10.1080/9502386.2011.535989&lt;/ref&gt; The spirit of the 60s as well as the experience of [[Vietnam war|Vietnam]] and black/gay liberation spurred the almost-frenzied energy pertinent in these discotheques. Not only did discos allow marginalized individuals an opportunity to express their sexuality and appreciate one another's diversity, they had the ability to influence popular music. Although once mutually exclusive, discotheques allowed for the coming together of black music and pop; this shows how disco music not only led to a social appreciation for diversity, but offered a platform on which Black artists could succeed.
The eventual commercialization of disco set in motion its decline. This new commodified disco, very different than its diverse and queer roots, idealized the white individual and favored heteronormative relations. This not only allowed for the roots of such a diverse movement to be lost, but the erasure of the liberation and escapism it offered many minorities.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Contemporary Western folk music===
Although public attention shifted to [[rock music]] from the mid 1960s, folk singers such as Joan Baez and Tom Paxton continued to address political concerns in their music and activism. Baez's 1974 ''[[Gracias a la Vida (album)|Gracias a la Vida]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William Ruhlmann |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/gracias-a-la-vida-mw0000651422 |title=Gracias a la Vida - Joan Baez &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; album was a response to [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|events]] in [[Chile]] and included versions of songs by [[Nueva canción|Nueva Canción Chilena]] singer-songwriters [[Violeta Parra]] and [[Victor Jara]]. Paxton albums such as ''Outward Bound''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Richie Unterberger]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/outward-bound-mw0000785860 |title=Outward Bound - Tom Paxton &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Morning Again''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Richie Unterberger]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/morning-again-mw0000786225 |title=Morning Again - Tom Paxton &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; continued to highlight political issues. They were joined by other activist musicians such as [[Holly Near]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William Ruhlmann |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hang-in-there-mw0000104473 |title=Hang in There - Holly Near &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ray Korona]], [[Charlie King (folksinger)|Charlie King]], [[Anne Feeney]], [[Jim Page (singer)|Jim Page]], [[Utah Phillips]] and more recently [[David Rovics]].

In [[Ireland]], the [[Wolfe Tones]] is perhaps the best known band in the folk protest/[[irish rebel music|rebel music]] tradition, recording political material since the late 1960s including songs by [[Dominic Behan]] on albums such as ''[[Let the People Sing (Wolfe Tones album)|Let the People Sing]]'' and ''[[Rifles of the I.R.A.]]'' [[Christy Moore]] has also recorded much political material, including on debut solo album ''[[Paddy on the Road]]'', produced by and featuring songs by Dominic Behan, and on albums such as ''[[Ride On (Christy Moore album)|Ride On]]'' (including "[[Viva la Quinta Brigada (song)|Viva la Quinta Brigada]]"), ''[[Ordinary Man (Christy Moore album)|Ordinary Man]]'' and various artists LP ''[[H Block]]'' to which Moore contributed "Ninety Miles from Dublin", in response to the [[Irish Republicanism|Republican]] prisoners' [[blanket protest]] of the late 1970s. Earlier in the decade, [[The Barleycorn]] had held the [[List of number-one singles of 1972 (Ireland)|#1 spot on the Irish charts]] for five weeks in 1972 with their first release "[[The Men Behind the Wire]]", about [[Operation Demetrius|internment]], with all profits going to the families of internees; [[Irish republicanism|Republican]] label R&amp;O Records likewise released several records around this time to fundraise for the same cause, including the live album ''Smash Internment'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.45worlds.com/vinyl/album/rol3002 |title=Vinyl Album - Various Artists - Smash Internment And Injustice - Live Recording In Long Kesh - R &amp; O - Ireland |website=45worlds.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded in [[Long Kesh]], and The Wolfhounds' recording of [[Paddy McGuigan]]'s "[[The Boys of the Old Brigade]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/ro1001 |title=The Wolfhounds [Ireland&amp;#93; - The Boys Of The Old Brigade / Ashtown Road - R&amp;O - Ireland - RO.1001 |website=45cat.com |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk music around the world===
Folk music had a strong connection with politics internationally. [[Hungary]], for instance, experimented with a form of liberal Communism in the late [[Cold War]] era, which was reflected in much of their folk music.&lt;ref name="World Music"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bohlman|first=Philip|title=World Music: A Very Short Introduction|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late twentieth century [[folk music]] was crucial in [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]] as it allowed ethnicities to express their national identity in a time of political uncertainty and chaos.&lt;ref&gt;World Music 2002, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

In Communist [[China]], exclusively national music was promoted. A flautist named Zhao Songtim – a member of the Zhejiang Song-and-Dance Troupe – attended an Arts festival in 1957 in Mexico but was punished for his international outlook by being expelled from the Troupe, and from 1966 to 1970 underwent "re-education". In 1973 he returned to the Troupe but was expelled again following accusations.&lt;ref&gt;''Folk Music of China'' (1995) by Stephen Jones, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of folk music being used for conservative, rather than radical, political ends is shown by the cultural activities of [[Edward Lansdale]], a [[CIA]] chief who dedicated part of his career to [[counter-insurgency]] in the [[Philippines]] and Vietnam. Lansdale believed that the government's best weapon against Communist rebellion was the support and trust of the population. In 1953 he arranged for the release of a campaign song widely credited with helping to elect Philippine president [[Ramon Magsaysay]], an important [[US]] anti-communist ally.&lt;ref name="Folk Music"/&gt; In 1965, intrigued by local Vietnamese customs and traditions, and the potential use of 'applied folklore' as a technique of raising consciousness, he began to record and curate tapes of folk songs for intelligence purposes. He also urged performers such as [[Phạm Duy]] to write and perform patriotic songs to raise morale in South Vietnam. Duy had written topical songs popular during the [[First Indochina war|anti-French struggle]] but then broke with the Communist-dominated [[Viet Minh]].&lt;ref name="Folk Music"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fish|first=Lydia|title=General Edward G. Lansdale and the Folksongs of Americans in the Vietnam War|journal=American Folklore|year=1989|volume=102|pages=390–411|jstor=541780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of political lyrics and the taking of political stances by rock musicians can be traced back to the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]],&lt;ref name="furious.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/marcus.html |title=Greil Marcus interview |website=Furious.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically the influence of the early career of Bob Dylan,&lt;ref name="dissentmagazine.org"/&gt; itself shaped by the politicised [[American folk music revival|folk revival]].

===1960s–70s counterculture===
During the 1960s and early 1970s counterculture era, musicians such as [[John Lennon]] commonly expressed protest themes in their music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/133778-revolutionary-man-john-lennon-as-political-artist/ |title=Revolutionary Man: John Lennon As Political Artist |publisher=PopMatters |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example on the [[Plastic Ono Band]]'s 1969 single "[[Give Peace a Chance]]". Lennon later devoted [[Some Time in New York City|an entire album]] to politics and wrote the song [[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]], widely considered to be a peace anthem. Its lyrics invoke a world without religion, national borders or private property.
 
In 1962-63, [[Bob Dylan]] sang about the evils of war, racism and poverty on his trademark political albums "[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]" and "[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]" (released in 1964), popularising the cause of the Civil Rights Movement. Dylan was influenced by the folk revival, as well as by the [[Beat Generation|Beat]] writers, and the political beliefs of the young generation of the era.&lt;ref name="dissentmagazine.org"/&gt; In turn, while Dylan's political phase comes under the 'folk' category, he was known as a rock artist from 1965 and remained associated with an anti-establishment stance that influenced other musicians – such as the [[British Invasion]] bands – and the rock music audience, by broadening the spectrum of subjects that could be addressed in popular song.&lt;ref name="furious.com"/&gt;

The [[MC5]] (Motor City 5) came out of the [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] underground scene of the late 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/MC5/benedmonds.html |title=MC5- Ben Edmonds interview |website=Furious.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and embodied an aggressive evolution of [[garage rock]] which was often fused with socio-political and countercultural lyrics, such as in the songs "Motor City Is Burning", (a [[John Lee Hooker]] cover adapting the story of the [[Detroit Race Riot (1943)]] to the [[12th Street riot|1967 12th Street Detroit Riot]]), and "American Ruse" (which discusses U.S. [[police brutality]] as well as [[pollution]], [[prison]], [[materialism]] and [[rebellion]]). They had ties to [[Far left|radical leftist]] groups such as [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers]] and [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]]'s [[White Panther Party]]. MC5 was the only band to perform a set before the [[1968 Democratic Convention]] in [[Chicago]], as part of the [[Yippie]]s' [[Festival of Life]] where an infamous riot subsequently broke out between police and students protesting the recent [[assassination]] of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and the [[Vietnam War]].

Other rock groups that conveyed specific political messages in the late 1960s/early 1970s – [[List of songs about the Vietnam War|often in regard to the Vietnam War]] – include [[The Fugs]], [[Country Joe and the Fish]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], and [[Third World War (band)|Third World War]], while some bands, such as The Beatles, [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Hawkwind]], referenced political issues occasionally and in a more observational than engaged way, e.g. in songs like "[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]", "[[Street Fighting Man]]", "[[Salt of the Earth (song)|Salt of the Earth]]" and "[[Urban Guerrilla]]".

===Punk rock===
{{Main article|Punk ideologies}}

Notable punk rock bands, such as [[Crass]], [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]], [[Sex Pistols]], [[The Clash]], [[Dead Kennedys]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Refused]], [[American Standards]], [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], [[Millions of Dead Cops|MDC]], [[Aus-Rotten]], [[Anti-Flag]], and [[Leftover Crack]] have used political and sometimes controversial lyrics that attack the establishment, sexism, capitalism, racism, speciesism, colonialism, and other phenomena they see as sources of social problems.

Since the late 1970s, [[punk rock]] has been associated with various left-wing or anti-establishment ideologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/612/what-riot-punk-rock-politics-fascism-and-rock-against-racism|title=What Riot?

The sincerity of the early punk bands has been questioned – some critics saw their referencing of revolutionary politics as a provocative pose rather than an ideology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burchill and Parsons|first=Julie and Tony|title=The Boy Looked At Johnny|year=1978|publisher=[[Pluto Press]]|location=London|isbn=0-86104-030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Denselow|first=Robin|title=When The Music's Over|year=1989|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London|isbn=0-571-13906-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; – but bands such as [[Crass]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Richie Unterberger]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/crass-mn0000129637/biography |title=Crass &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dead Kennedys]]&lt;ref name="DKs"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dead-kennedys-mn0000786613/biography |title=Dead Kennedys &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; later emerged who held strong anarchist views, and over time this association strengthened, as they went on to influence other bands in the UK [[anarcho-punk]] and US [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] [[subgenre]]s, respectively.

The Sex Pistols song "[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]" was banned from broadcast by the BBC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/sex-pistols-mn0000418740/biography |title=Sex Pistols &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|1977]] due to its presumed anti-[[Royalism]], partly due to its apparent equation of the monarchy with a "fascist regime". The following year, the release of debut Crass album [[The Feeding Of the 5000]] was initially obstructed when pressing plant workers refused to produce it due to sacrilegious lyrical content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Matt Grimes |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/a-history-of-music-censorship-9051887.html |title=A history of music censorship |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crass later faced court charges of obscenity related to their [[Penis Envy (album)|Penis Envy]] album, as the Dead Kennedys later did over their [[Frankenchrist]] album artwork.&lt;ref name="DKs"/&gt;

[[The Clash]] are regarded as pioneers of political punk, and were seen to represent a progressive, socialistic worldview compared to the apparently anti-social or [[Political nihilism|nihilistic]] attack of many early punk bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Antonino D’Ambrosio |url=http://monthlyreview.org/2003/06/01/let-fury-have-the-hour-the-passionate-politics-of-joe-strummer |title='Let Fury Have the Hour': The Passionate Politics of Joe Strummer by Antonino D’Ambrosio |publisher=Monthly Review |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-clash-mn0000075747/biography |title=The Clash &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly inspired by 1960s protest music such as the MC5, their stance influenced other first and second wave punk/[[new wave music|new wave]] bands such as [[The Jam]], [[The Ruts]], [[Stiff Little Fingers]], [[Angelic Upstarts]], [[Tom Robinson Band|TRB]] and [[Newtown Neurotics]], and inspired a lyrical focus on subjects such as [[White Riot|racial tension]], [[Career Opportunities (song)|unemployment]], [[Garageland (song)|class resentment]], [[London's Burning (The Clash song)|urban alienation]] and police violence, as well as [[I'm So Bored with the USA|imperialism]].

Many punk musicians, such as [[Vic Bondi]] ([[Articles of Faith (band)|Articles of Faith]]), [[Joey Keithley]] ([[DOA (band)|DOA]]), [[Tim McIlrath]] ([[Rise Against]]), [[The Crucifucks]], [[Bad Religion]], [[The Proletariat]], [[Against All Authority]], [[Dropkick Murphys]] and [[Crashdog]] have held and expressed left-wing views. Dead Kennedys singer [[Jello Biafra]], as well as [[T.S.O.L.]] frontman [[Jack Grisham]], have run as candidates for public office under left-wing platforms. However, some punk bands have expressed more [[Populism|populist]] and [[conservative]] opinions, and an ambiguous form of [[patriotism]], beginning in the U.S with many of the groups associated with 1980s [[New York hardcore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Damon Root |url=http://reason.com/blog/2009/12/08/the-politics-of-hardcore-punk |title=The Politics of Hardcore Punk - Hit &amp; Run |website=Reason.com |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prior to that in the UK with a small section of the [[Oi!]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Worley |url=http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/03/20/tcbh.hwt001.full |title=Oi!

An extremely small minority of punk rock bands, exemplified by (1980s-era) [[Skrewdriver]] and [[Skullhead]], have held [[far-right politics|far-right]] and [[anticommunism|anti-communist]] stances, and were consequently reviled in the broader, largely Leftist punk subculture.

[[Rock the Vote]] is an American [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit]], [[non-partisan]] organization founded in Los Angeles in 1990 by Jeff Ayeroff for the purposes of political advocacy. Rock the Vote works to engage youth in the political process by incorporating the entertainment community and youth culture into its activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockthevote.com/rtv_about.php |title=About Rock the Vote |website=Rockthevote.com |date=1993-02-05 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock the Vote's stated mission is to "build the political clout and engagement of young people in order to achieve progressive change in our country."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120930064408/http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=ind_focus.story&amp;STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F12-19-2007%2F0004725469&amp;EDATE=WED+Dec+19+2007%2C+09%3A00+AM ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hip hop==
Hip hop music has been associated with protest since 1982, when "[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]" by [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]] became known as the first prominent rap record to make a serious “social statement”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/message-bronx-history-rap-city-article-1.576580|title=MESSAGE FROM THE BRONX     THE HISTORY OF RAP IN THE CITY|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-50-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time-20121205/grandmaster-flash-and-the-furious-five-the-message-19691231|title=50 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs of All Time|website=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the first political rap release has been credited to Brother D and the Collective Effort’s 1980 single “How We Gonna Make the Black Nation Rise?” which called the USA a “police state” and rapped about historical injustices such as slavery and ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2013/08/05/alex-abramovich/agitate-educate-organize/|title=Alex Abramovich: Agitate, Educate, Organize|first=Alex|last=Abramovich|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the decade hip hop band [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] became "perhaps the most well-known and influential political rap group"&lt;ref name="grio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegrio.com/2010/06/15/hip-hop-and-politics-have-a-long-history-behind-the-mic/|title=Hip-hop and politics have a long history behind the mic - theGrio|date=15 June 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released a series of records whose message and success "directed hip-hop toward an explicitly self-aware, pro-black consciousness that became the culture's signature throughout the next decade,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/public-enemy-mn0000856785/biography|title=Public Enemy - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; helping to inspire a wave of politicised hip hop by artists such as [[X Clan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/x-clan-mn0000585601/biography|title=X Clan - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poor Righteous Teachers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/poor-righteous-teachers-mn0000852698/biography|title=Poor Righteous Teachers - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brand Nubian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/brand-nubian-mn0000933772/biography|title=Brand Nubian - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[2 Black 2 Strong MMG|2 Black 2 Strong]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/2-black-2-strong-mn0000899479/biography|title=2 Black 2 Strong - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paris (rapper)|Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/paris-mn0000003182/biography|title=Paris - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular music==
Popular music found throughout the world contains political messages such as those concerning social issues and racism. For example, Lady Gaga's song [[Born This Way (song)]] has often been known as the international gay anthem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mo|first1=Jang|title=When Pop Music Meets A Political Issue: Examining How "Born This Way" Influences Attitudes Toward Gays And Gay Rights Policies.|journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|date=2014|volume=1|issue=58|pages=114–130|doi=10.1080/08838151.2013.875023}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it discusses homosexuality in a positive light and expresses the idea that it is natural. Furthermore, the natural disaster of [[Hurricane Katrina]] received a great political response from the [[hip-hop|Hip hop music]] community. The content of the music changed into a response showing the complex dynamic of the community, especially the black community, while also acting a sometimes contradictory protest of how the disaster was handled in the aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=George|first1=Courtney|title=From Bounce To The Mainstream: Hip Hop Representations Of Post-Katrina New Orleans In Music, Film And Television|journal=European Journal of American Culture|date=2016|volume=35|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This topic even reached beyond the locality of New Orleans, as the issue of the disaster and racism was mentioned by other rappers from other regions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=George|first1=Courtney|title=From Bounce To The Mainstream: Hip Hop Representations Of Post-Katrina New Orleans In Music, Film And Television.|journal=European Journal of American Culture|date=2016|volume=35|issue=1|pages=17–32|doi=10.1386/ejac.35.1.17_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racist music==
{{Distinguish|Race music}}
Racist music or [[white power music]] is music associated with and promoting [[neo-Nazism]] and [[white supremacy]] ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;''Intelligence Report'': a project of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], Issues 133-136; Southern Poverty Law Center, Klanwatch Project, Southern Poverty Law Center. Militia Task Force, Publisher Klanwatch, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Musicology|musicologists]] point out that many, if not most early cultures had songs to promote themselves and denigrate any perceived enemies, the origins of Racist music is traced to the 1970s. By 2001 there were many music genres with 'white power rock' the most commonly represented band type, followed by [[National Socialist black metal]].&lt;ref name=pulera&gt;Dominic J. Pulera, ''Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America'',  pages 309-311.&lt;/ref&gt; 'Racist country music' is mainly an American phenomena while Germany, Great Britain, and Sweden have higher concentration of white power bands.&lt;ref name=pulera/&gt; Other music genres include 'fascist experimental music' and 'racist folk music'.&lt;ref name=pulera/&gt; Contemporary white-supremacist groups include "subcultural factions that are largely organized around the promotion and distribution of racist music."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Perry, ''Hate Crimes'', Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|0-275-99569-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-275-99569-0}}, 2009, pages 51-2.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]] "racist music is principally derived from the far-right skinhead movement and, through the internet, this music has become perhaps the most important tool of the international neo-Nazi movement to gain revenue and new recruits."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hreoc.gov.au/racial_discrimination/cyberracism/examples.html "Racist Music: Publication, Merchandising and Recruitment"], ''[[Cyber racism]]'', Race Discrimination Unit, HREOC, October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Rooney, ''Race Hate'', Evans Brothers, 2006, {{ISBN|0-237-52717-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-237-52717-4}}, page 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The news documentary ''[[VH1]] News Special: Inside Hate Rock'' (2002) noted that Racist music (also called 'Hate music' and 'Skinhead rock') is "a breeding ground for [[Domestic terrorism in the United States|home-grown terrorists]]."&lt;ref&gt;David Bianculli, [http://articles.nydailynews.com/2002-02-18/entertainment/18189857_1_white-supremacist-eighth-letter-hate ''Vh1 Special Goes Behind The (racist) Music''], ''[[New York Daily News]]'', February 18, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 a neo-Nazi record company launched "Project Schoolyard" to distribute free CDs of the music into the hands of up to 100,000 teenagers throughout the U.S., their website stated, "We just don't entertain racist kids … We create them."&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Foxman, [http://www.worldpress.org/Americas/1997.cfm "Hate Music: New Recruitment Tool for White Supremacists"], ''Worldpress.org'', December 17, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Houghton, of the [[National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism]], said that Racist music was a great recruiting tool, "Through music ... to grab these kids, teach them to be racists and hook them for life."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120105013218/http://www.koco.com/r/3962764/detail.html "Record Label Targets Teens With Hate Message: Sampler CD Of White Power Music Circulating In Numerous U.S. Schools"], Ohio/Oklahoma Hearst Television Inc. on behalf of ''KOCO-TV'',  December 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Country music==
American [[country music]] contains numerous images of "[[tradition]]al" life, family life, religious life, as well as patriotic themes. Songs such as [[Merle Haggard]]'s "[[The Fightin' Side of Me]]", and "[[Okie from Muskogee (song)|Okie from Muskogee]]" have been perceived as patriotic songs which contain an "us versus them" mentality directed at the [[counterculture]] "[[hippie]]s" and the [[anti-war]] crowd, though these were actually misconceptions by listeners who failed to understand their satirical nature.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, Bill, "Country Music U.S.A," 2nd rev. ed. (University of Texas Press, Austin, 2002), p.371.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical music==
[[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|third symphony]] was originally called "Bonaparte". In 1804 Napoleon crowned himself emperor, whereupon Beethoven rescinded the dedication. The symphony was renamed "Heroic Symphony composed to Celebrate the Memory of a Great Man".{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s chorus of Hebrew slaves in the opera ''[[Nabucco]]'' is a kind of rallying-cry for Italians to throw off the yoke of Austrian domination (in the north) and French domination (near Rome)—the "Risorgimento". Following unification, Verdi was awarded a seat in the national parliament.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Richard Taruskin of the University of California accused [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] of "romanticizing terrorists" in his opera ''[[The Death of Klinghoffer]]'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;article in the December 9, 2001, ''New York Times'' Arts and Leisure section&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=March 2017}}&lt;!--Exactly how does this accusation by Taruskin constitute a political stance--is it Taruskin, as a music critic, or is it Adams, who somehow is obviously guilty of the charge?--&gt;

===In the Soviet Union===
[[RAPM (association)|RAPM]] (The Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians) was formed in the early 1920s. In 1929 Stalin gave them his backing. [[Shostakovich]] had dedicated his first symphony to Mikhail Kvardi. In 1929 Kvardi was arrested and executed. In an article in ''The Worker and the Theatre'', Shostakovich's ''The Tahitit Trot'' (from the ballet ''The Golden Age'') was criticised; Ivan Yershov claimed it was part of "ideology harmful to the proletariat"". Shostakovich's response was to write his third symphony, ''The First of May'' (1929) to express "the festive mood of peaceful construction".&lt;ref&gt;''Shostakovich and Stalin'' by Solomon Volkov (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Shostakovich Studies'' (1995) edited by David Fanning&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prokofiev]] wrote music to order for the Soviet Union, including ''Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution'' (1937). [[Khachaturian]]'s ballet ''Spartacus'' (1954/6) concerns gladiator slaves who rebel against their former Roman masters. It was seen as a metaphor for the overthrow of the Czar.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Similarly Prokofiev's music for the film ''[[Alexander Nevsky (Prokofiev)|Alexander Nevsky]]'' concerns the invasion of Teutonic knights into the Baltic States. It was seen as a metaphor for the Nazi invasion of the USSR.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} In general Soviet music was neo-romantic while Fascist music was neo-classical.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Music in Nazi Germany===
[[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] stated in 1930, "I don't believe anyone venerates [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] more than I";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sachs|first=Harvey|title=Music in fascist Italy|year=1988|publisher=Norton|location=New York|isbn=0-393-02563-2|authorlink=Harvey Sachs}}&lt;/ref&gt; however by 1943 Stravinsky was banned in Nazi Germany because he had chosen to live in the USA. Beginning in 1940, [[Carl Orff]]'s cantata ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'' was performed at Nazi Party functions, and acquired the status of a quasi-official anthem.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford History of Western Music, vol 4'' (2005) by Richard Taruskin&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 Berlin Radio issued a formal ban on the broadcasting of jazz. However, it was still possible to hear swing music played by German bands. This was because of the moderating influence of [[Goebbels]], who knew the value of entertaining the troops. In the period 1933-45 the music of [[Gustav Mahler]], a Jewish Austrian, virtually disappeared from the concert performances of the Berlin Philharmonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levi|first=Erik|title=Music in the Third Reich|year=1996|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-12948-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Strauss]]'s opera ''[[Die Schweigsame Frau]]'' (The Silent Woman) was banned from 1935 to 1945 because the librettist, [[Stefan Zweig]], was a Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= The Twisted Muse |last= Kater |first= Michael |year= 1999 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= 0-19-513242-4 |page= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Youth Leadership Training''', often called '''NYLT''', is the current youth leadership development training offered by the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. The program is conducted by [[Boy Scouts of America#Local councils|councils]] over five days for [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scouts]], [[Varsity Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Varsity Scouts]] and [[Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)|Venturers]]. The Boy Scout and venture training programs merged in 2010. This training is a part of the national organization's [[Leadership training (Boy Scouts of America)|leadership training]] program.

==History==
[[File:2011 06 16 5452.JPG (5847481742).jpg|thumb|left|Participants set off on an excursion at [[Potawatomi Area Council#Camp Long Lake|Camp Long Lake]]]]

In 1949 Scouts from 24 councils in 16 states formed a Junior Leader Training Troop at [[Philmont Scout Ranch]] for a forty day training program in leadership and Scoutcraft. In 1950 the "Junior Leaders' Training Course was developed to give intensive training in Scouting skills and techniques to select Explorers. Each is trained with the end in view that he in turn will train other junior leaders. The course has four parts. The first is centered around studying leadership methods, organization, patrol method, Explorer crews, troop meetings, and camping skills. The second part deals with teaching the same skills.

The fourth part is devoted to a model junior leaders’ conference, and projects in nature lore, special Scoutcraft skills, emergency service, and personal and group service.” In 1952 at Philmont Scout Ranch 270 participants and at Schiff Scout Reservation 436 participants completed junior leader training camps.

[[File:Archaeopteryx lithographica (Berlin specimen).jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Berlin specimen of ''[[Archaeopteryx|Archaeopteryx lithographica]]'']]
The scientific question of within which larger group of animals [[evolution of birds|birds evolved]], has traditionally been called the '''origin of birds'''. The present [[scientific consensus]] is that [[bird]]s are a group of [[Theropoda|theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s that [[evolution|originated]] during the [[Mesozoic|Mesozoic Era]].

A close relationship between [[bird]]s and dinosaurs was first proposed in the nineteenth century after the discovery of the primitive bird ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' in [[Germany]]. Birds and extinct non-avian dinosaurs share many unique skeletal traits.&lt;ref name="Chiappe2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chiappe|first=Luis M.|year=2009|title=Downsized Dinosaurs: The Evolutionary Transition to Modern Birds|journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach|pages=248–256|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/66w3755838876571/|accessdate=2009-11-14|doi=10.1007/s12052-009-0133-4|volume=2|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, fossils of more than thirty species of non-avian dinosaur have been collected with preserved feathers. There are even very small dinosaurs, such as ''[[Microraptor]]'' and ''[[Anchiornis]]'', which have long, [[Feathers#Structures and characteristics|vaned]], arm and leg feathers forming wings. The Jurassic basal [[avialan]] ''[[Pedopenna]]'' also shows these long foot feathers. Witmer in 2009 concluded that this evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that avian evolution went through a four-winged stage.&lt;ref name=Witmer2009/&gt; Fossil evidence also demonstrates that birds and dinosaurs shared features such as hollow, [[pneumatized bones]], [[gastrolith]]s in the [[gastrointestinal tract|digestive]] system, nest-building and [[Avian incubation|brooding behaviors]].

Although the origin of birds has historically been a contentious topic within [[evolutionary biology]], only a few scientists still debate the dinosaurian origin of birds, suggesting descent from other types of archosaurian [[reptile]]s. Within the consensus that supports dinosaurian ancestry, the exact sequence of evolutionary events that gave rise to the early birds within maniraptoran theropods is disputed. The origin of [[bird flight]] is a separate but related question for which there are also several proposed answers.

==Research history==

===Huxley, ''Archaeopteryx'' and early research===
[[File:T.H.Huxley(Woodburytype).jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Henry Huxley]] (1825–1895).]]
Scientific investigation into the origin of birds began shortly after the 1859 publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.&lt;ref name=darwin&gt;{{cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles R. |authorlink=Charles Darwin |year=1859 |title=On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life |location=London |publisher=John Murray |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=16 |page=502pp |isbn=1-4353-9386-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, a fossilized feather was discovered in [[Germany]]'s [[Late Jurassic]] [[Solnhofen limestone]]. [[Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer]] described this feather as ''Archaeopteryx lithographica'' the next year.&lt;ref name=meyer&gt;{{cite journal |last=von Meyer |first=C.E. Hermann. |authorlink=Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer |year=1861 |title=''Archaeopteryx lithographica'' (Vogel-Feder) und ''Pterodactylus'' von Solnhofen |journal=Neues Jahrbuch für Mineralogie, Geologie und Paläontologie |volume=1861 |pages=678–679 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Owen]] described a nearly complete skeleton in 1863, recognizing it as a bird despite many features reminiscent of [[reptile]]s, including clawed forelimbs and a long, bony tail.&lt;ref name=owen&gt;{{cite journal |last=Owen |first=Richard. |authorlink=Richard Owen |year=1863 |title=On the ''Archeopteryx'' [sp] of von Meyer, with a description of the fossil remains of a long-tailed species, from the lithographic stone of Solenhofen [sp] |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|volume=153 |pages=33–47 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1863.0003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biologist]] [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], known as "Darwin's Bulldog" for his tenacious support of the new theory of evolution by means of natural selection, almost immediately seized upon ''Archaeopteryx'' as a [[transitional fossil]] between birds and reptiles. Starting in 1868, and following earlier suggestions by [[Karl Gegenbaur]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gegenbaur | first1 = K. | year = 1863 | title = Vergleichend-anatomische Bemerkungen über das Fußskelet der Vögel | url = | journal = Archiv für Anatomie, Physiologie und Wissenschaftliche Medicin | volume = 1863 | issue = | pages = 450–472 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edward Drinker Cope]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cope | first1 = E.D. | year = 1867 | title = An account of the extinct reptiles which approached the birds | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 234–235 }}[https://archive.org/details/proceedingsofaca19acad link]&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley made detailed comparisons of ''Archaeopteryx'' with various prehistoric reptiles and found that it was most similar to dinosaurs like ''[[Hypsilophodon]]'' and ''[[Compsognathus]]''.&lt;ref name=huxley1868&gt;{{cite journal |last= Huxley|first= T.H.  |authorlink=Thomas Henry Huxley |year=1868|title= On the animals which are most nearly intermediate between birds and reptiles |journal=Annals and Magazine of Natural History |volume=2 |pages=66–75 |series=4th |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/22247928}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=huxley1870&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huxley |first=Thomas H. |authorlink=Thomas Henry Huxley |year=1870 |title={{ws | [[s: Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London/Volume 26/Further Evidence of the Affinity between the Dinosaurian Reptiles and Birds|Further evidence of the affinity between the dinosaurian reptiles and birds]]|ps=no}} |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London |volume=26 |pages=12–31 |doi=10.1144/GSL.JGS.1870.026.01-02.08 |issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery in the late 1870s of the iconic "Berlin specimen" of ''Archaeopteryx'', complete with a set of reptilian teeth, provided further evidence. Huxley was the first to propose an evolutionary relationship between birds and dinosaurs. Although Huxley was opposed by the very influential Owen, his conclusions were accepted by many biologists, including [[Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás|Baron Franz Nopcsa]],&lt;ref name=nopcsa&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nopcsa |first=Franz. |authorlink=Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás |year=1907 |title=Ideas on the origin of flight |journal=Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London |pages=223–238}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others, notably [[Harry Seeley]],&lt;ref name=seeley&gt;{{cite book |last=Seeley |first=Harry G. |year=1901 |authorlink=Harry Seeley |title=Dragons of the Air: An Account of Extinct Flying Reptiles |location=London |publisher=Methuen &amp; Co. |page=239pp}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the similarities were due to [[convergent evolution]].

===Heilmann and the thecodont hypothesis===
{{main|The Origin of Birds (book)}}
A turning point came in the early twentieth century with the writings of [[Gerhard Heilmann]] of [[Denmark]]. An artist by trade, Heilmann had a scholarly interest in birds and from 1913 to 1916, expanding on earlier work by [[Othenio Abel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abel | first1 = O | year = 1911 | title = Die Vorfahren der Vögel und ihre Lebensweise | url = | journal = Verhandlungen der Zoologisch-Botanischen Gesellschaft in Wien | volume = 61 | issue = | pages = 144–191 }}&lt;/ref&gt; published the results of his research in several parts, dealing with the anatomy, [[embryology]], behavior, paleontology, and evolution of birds.&lt;ref name=nieuwland2004&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nieuwland |first=Ilja J.J. |year=2004 |title=Gerhard Heilmann and the artist's eye in science, 1912-1927 |journal=PalArch's Journal of Vertebrate Palaeontology |volume=3 |issue=2 |url=http://www.palarch.nl/wp-content/ver_2004_3_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work, originally written in [[Danish language|Danish]] as ''Vor Nuvaerende Viden om Fuglenes Afstamning'', was compiled, translated into English, and published in 1926 as ''[[The Origin of Birds (book)|The Origin of Birds]]''.
[[File:Proav16 large.jpg|thumb|left|Heilmann's hypothetical illustration of a pair of fighting '[[Proaves]]' from 1916]]
Like Huxley, Heilmann compared ''Archaeopteryx'' and other birds to an exhaustive list of prehistoric reptiles, and also came to the conclusion that theropod dinosaurs like ''Compsognathus'' were the most similar. However, Heilmann noted that birds had [[clavicle]]s (collar bones) fused to form a bone called the [[furcula]] ("wishbone"), and while clavicles were known in more primitive reptiles, they had not yet been recognized in dinosaurs. Since he was a firm believer in [[Dollo's law]], which states that evolution is not reversible, Heilmann could not accept that clavicles were lost in dinosaurs and re-evolved in birds. He was therefore forced to rule out dinosaurs as bird ancestors and ascribe all of their similarities to [[convergent evolution]]. Heilmann stated that bird ancestors would instead be found among the more primitive "[[Thecodontia|thecodont]]" grade of reptiles.&lt;ref name=heilmann&gt;{{cite book |last=Heilmann |first=Gerhard |year=1926 |title=The Origin of Birds |location=London |publisher=Witherby |page=208pp |isbn=0-486-22784-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heilmann's extremely thorough approach ensured that his book became a classic in the field, and its conclusions on bird origins, as with most other topics, were accepted by nearly all evolutionary biologists for the next four decades.&lt;ref name=padian2004&gt;{{cite book |last=Padian |first=Kevin. |year=2004 |chapter=Basal Avialae |editor=[[David B. Weishampel|Weishampel, David B.]] |editor2=[[Peter Dodson|Dodson, Peter]] |editor3=Osmólska, Halszka |title=The Dinosauria |edition=Second |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |pages=210–231 |isbn=0-520-24209-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clavicles are relatively delicate bones and therefore in danger of being destroyed or at least damaged beyond recognition. Nevertheless, some fossil theropod clavicles had actually been excavated before Heilmann wrote his book but these had been misidentified.&lt;ref&gt;For example in 1923, three years before Heilmans's book, [[Roy Chapman Andrews]] found a good ''[[Oviraptor]]'' fossil in ''[[Mongolia]]'', but [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]], who analyzed the fossil in 1924, misidentified the furcula as an [[interclavicle]]; described in {{cite book |title = Dinosaurs of the Air: The Evolution and Loss of Flight in Dinosaurs and Birds|author = Paul, G.S.|year = 2002|publisher = JHU Press|isbn = 0-8018-6763-0|url = https://books.google.com/?id=OUwXzD3iihAC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=oviraptor+furcula}} &lt;!--The first correct identification of dinosaur clavicles / furcula was in 1983, also in an ''Oviraptor'': {{cite journal |author=Barsbold, R. |date=1983 |title=[Carnivorous dinosaurs from the Cretaceous of Mongolia |journal=Trudy Soumestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontogicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |volume=19 |pages=1–117 (in Russian!) }} --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to what Heilmann believed, paleontologists now accept that clavicles and in most cases furculae are a standard feature not just of theropods but of [[saurischia]]n dinosaurs.

===Furculae===
At one time, it was believed that dinosaurs lacked [[furcula]]e (fused left and right [[clavicle]]s, or "wishbones"). This was considered an overwhelming argument to refute the dinosaur ancestry of birds by Heilmann (1926). However, it has been shown since then that numerous [[Tetanurae|tetanuran]] theropod species indeed have a furcula,&lt;ref&gt;Included as a cladistic definer, e.g. [http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/edu/dees/courses/v1001/masterclads.html (Columbia University) Master Cladograms] or mentioned even in the broadest context, such as  {{cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.earth.25.1.435 | last1 = Sereno | first1 = Paul C. | year = 1997| title = The origin and evolution of dinosaurs | url = | journal = Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 435–489 |bibcode = 1997AREPS..25..435S }}&lt;/ref&gt; apparently a tetanuran innovation. The presence of a furcula even in ''[[Allosaurus]]'', a relatively basal tetanuran, has been confirmed, and in an Early Jurassic theropod&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rvc.ac.uk/AboutUs/Staff/jhutchinson/documents/JH18.pdf Matthew R.

There is evidence that the evolution of the furcula was well underway when the earliest dinosaurs were diversifying; joined, furcula-like clavicles are known from ''[[Massospondylus]]'', an Early Jurassic [[sauropodomorpha|sauropodomorph]].&lt;ref name=YV05/&gt;         --&gt;

===Ostrom, ''Deinonychus'' and the dinosaur renaissance===
[[File:Archaeo-deinony hands.svg|thumb|right|The similarity of the forelimbs of ''[[Deinonychus]]'' (left) and ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' (right) led [[John Ostrom]] to revive the link between dinosaurs and birds.]]
The tide began to turn against the 'thecodont' hypothesis after the 1964 discovery of a new theropod dinosaur in [[Montana]]. In 1969, this dinosaur was described and named ''[[Deinonychus]]'' by [[John Ostrom]] of [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name=ostrom1969&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ostrom |first=John H. |authorlink=John Ostrom |year=1969 |title=Osteology of ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'', an unusual theropod from the Lower Cretaceous of Montana |journal=Bulletin of the Peabody Museum of Natural History |volume=30 |pages=1–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, Ostrom redescribed a specimen of ''[[Pterodactylus]]'' in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Teylers Museum|Teyler Museum]] as another skeleton of ''Archaeopteryx''.&lt;ref name=ostrom1970&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ostrom |first=John H. |authorlink=John Ostrom |year=1970 |title=''Archaeopteryx'': Notice of a "new" specimen |journal=Science |volume=170 |issue=3957 |pages=537–8 |doi=10.1126/science.170.3957.537 |pmid=17799709|bibcode = 1970Sci...170..537O }}&lt;/ref&gt; The specimen consisted mainly of a single wing and its description made Ostrom aware of the similarities between the wrists of ''Archaeopteryx'' and ''Deinonychus''.&lt;ref name=chambers&gt;{{cite book |last=Chambers |first=Paul |year=2002 |authorlink=Paul Chambers |title=Bones of Contention: The Archaeopteryx Scandals |location=London |publisher=John Murray Ltd |pages=183–184 |isbn=0-7195-6054-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, [[United Kingdom|British]] paleontologist [[Alick Walker]] hypothesized that birds arose not from 'thecodonts' but from [[crocodile]] ancestors like ''[[Sphenosuchus]]''.&lt;ref name=walker&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walker |first=Alick D. |authorlink=Alick Walker |year=1972 |title=New light on the origin of birds and crocodiles |journal=Nature |volume=237 |issue=5353 |pages=257–263 |doi=10.1038/237257a0|bibcode = 1972Natur.237..257W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ostrom's work with both theropods and early birds led him to respond with a series of publications in the mid-1970s in which he laid out the many similarities between birds and theropod dinosaurs, resurrecting the ideas first put forth by Huxley over a century before.&lt;ref name=ostrom1973&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ostrom |first=John H. |authorlink=John Ostrom |year=1973 |title=The ancestry of birds |journal=Nature |volume=242 |issue=5393 |pages=136–136 |doi=10.1038/242136a0|bibcode = 1973NPhS..242..136O }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ostrom1975&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ostrom |first=John H. |authorlink=John Ostrom |year=1975 |title=The origin of birds |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume=3 |pages=55–77 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ea.03.050175.000415 |isbn=0-912532-57-2|bibcode = 1975AREPS...3...55O |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ostrom1976&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ostrom |first=John H. |authorlink=John Ostrom |year=1976 |title=''Archaeopteryx'' and the origin of birds |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=91–182 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1976.tb00244.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ostrom's recognition of the dinosaurian ancestry of birds, along with other new ideas about dinosaur metabolism,&lt;ref name=bakker1972&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bakker |first=Robert T. |authorlink=Robert T.

Ostrom's revelations also coincided with the increasing adoption of phylogenetic systematics ([[cladistics]]), which began in the 1960s with the work of [[Willi Hennig]].&lt;ref name=hennig&gt;{{cite book |last=Hennig |first=E.H.

===Digit homology===
There is a debate between [[embryology|embryologists]] and [[paleontology|paleontologists]] whether the hands of [[theropoda|theropod]] dinosaurs and birds are essentially different, based on [[Phalanges of the hand|phalangeal]] counts, a count of the number of phalanges (fingers) in the hand. This is an important and fiercely debated area of research because its results may challenge the consensus that birds are descendants of dinosaurs.

Embryologists and some paleontologists who oppose the bird-dinosaur link have long numbered the digits of birds II-III-IV on the basis of multiple studies of the development in the egg.&lt;ref name=Chatterjee&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chatterjee|first=Sankar|authorlink=Sankar Chatterjee|title=Counting the Fingers of Birds and Dinosaurs|publisher=Science|date=17 April 1998|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/280/5362/355a|doi=10.1126/science.280.5362.355a|accessdate=June 21, 2007|journal=Science|volume=280|issue=5362|pages=355a|bibcode=1998Sci...280..355C}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on the fact that in most [[amniote]]s, the first digit to form in a 5-fingered hand is digit IV, which develops a primary axis. Therefore, embryologists have identified the primary axis in birds as digit IV, and the surviving digits as II-III-IV. The fossils of advanced [[theropoda|theropod]] ([[Tetanurae]]) hands appear to have the digits I-II-III (some genera within [[Avetheropoda]] also have a reduced digit IV&lt;ref&gt;[[University of Maryland]] department of geology home page, [http://www.geol.umd.edu/~tholtz/G104/10422ther.htm "Theropoda I" on ''Avetheropoda''], 14 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;). 
If this is true, then the II-III-IV development of digits in birds is an indication against theropod (dinosaur) ancestry. However, with no [[ontogeny|ontogenical]] (developmental) basis to definitively state which digits are which on a theropod hand (because no non-avian theropods can be observed growing and developing today), the labelling of the theropod hand is not absolutely conclusive.

Paleontologists have traditionally identified avian digits as I-II-III. They argue that the digits of birds number I-II-III, just as those of theropod dinosaurs do, by the conserved phalangeal formula. The phalangeal count for archosaurs is 2-3-4-5-3; many archosaur lineages have a reduced number of digits, but have the same [[phalanx bones|phalangeal formula]] in the digits that remain. In other words, paleontologists assert that archosaurs of different lineages tend to lose the same digits when digit loss occurs, from the outside to the inside. The three digits of [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurs]], and ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' have the same phalangeal formula of I-II-III as digits I-II-III of [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] archosaurs. Therefore, the lost digits would be V and IV. If this is true, then modern birds would also possess digits I-II-III.&lt;ref name=Chatterjee/&gt; 
Also, one 1999 publication proposed a frame-shift in the digits of the theropod line leading to birds (thus making digit I into digit II, II to III, and so forth).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.9.5111 | last1 = Wagner | first1 = G.

However, such frame shifts are rare in amniotes and—to be consistent with the theropod origin of birds—would have had to occur solely in the bird-theropod lineage forelimbs and not the hindlimbs (a condition unknown in any animal).&lt;ref&gt;[http://8e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=16&amp;id=161 Developmental Biology 8e Online.

===Thermogenic muscle hypothesis===
A 2011 publication suggested that selection for the expansion of [[skeletal muscle]], rather than the evolution of flight, was the driving force for the emergence of this clade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Newman SA | title = Thermogenesis, muscle hyperplasia, and the origin of birds | journal = BioEssays | volume = 33 | pages = 653–656 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21695679 | doi = 10.1002/bies.201100061 | issue = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Newman SA, Mezentseva NV, Badyaev AV | title = Gene loss, thermogenesis, and the origin of birds | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1289 | pages = 36–47 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23550607 | doi = 10.1111/nyas.12090 | issue = 1| bibcode = 2013NYASA1289...36N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Muscles became larger in prospectively [[warm-blooded|endothermic]] [[saurian]]s, according to this hypothesis, as a response to the loss of the [[vertebrate]] [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] [[uncoupling protein]], [[UCP1]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mezentseva NV, Kumaratilake JS, Newman SA | title  =  The brown adipocyte differentiation pathway in birds: An evolutionary road not taken | journal = BMC Biology | volume = 6 | page = 17 | year = 2008 |  doi=10.1186/1741-7007-6-17 | pmid = 18426587 | pmc = 2375860 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is [[Thermogenics|thermogenic]]. In [[mammal]]s, UCP1 functions within [[brown adipose tissue]] to protect newborns against [[hypothermia]]. 
In modern birds, skeletal muscle serves a similar function and is presumed to have done so in their ancestors. In this view, [[bipedality]] and other avian [[skeleton|skeletal]] alterations were side effects of muscle [[hyperplasia]], with further evolutionary modifications of the forelimbs, including adaptations for flight or swimming, and [[vestigiality]], being secondary consequences of two-leggedness.

===Feathers===
{{Main|Feathered dinosaur}}
''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', the first good example of a "feathered dinosaur", was discovered in 1861. The first specimen was found in the [[Solnhofen limestone]] in southern Germany, which is a ''[[lagerstätte]]'', a rare and remarkable [[geology|geological]] formation known for its superbly detailed fossils. ''Archaeopteryx'' is a [[transitional fossil]], with features clearly intermediate between those of non-avian theropod dinosaurs and [[birds]]. Discovered just two years after Darwin's seminal ''[[On the Origin of Species|Origin of Species]]'', its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of [[evolutionary biology]] and [[creationism]]. This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, at least one [[Biological specimen|specimen]] was mistaken for ''[[Compsognathus]]''.&lt;ref name=PW88&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wellnhofer | first1 = P. | year = 1988 | title = Ein neuer Exemplar von ''Archaeopteryx'' | url = | journal = Archaeopteryx | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 1–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, a number of additional [[feathered dinosaurs]] have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. The first of these were initially described as simple filamentous ''protofeathers'', which were reported in dinosaur lineages as primitive as [[Compsognathidae|compsognathids]] and [[Tyrannosauroidea|tyrannosauroids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15470426  |name-list-format=vanc| last1 = Xu | first1 = X| doi=10.1038/nature02855 | last2 = Norell | first2 = MA | last3 = Kuang | first3 = X | last4 = Wang | first4 = X | last5 = Zhao | first5 = Q | last6 = Jia | first6 = C | title = Basal tyrannosauroids from China and evidence for protofeathers in tyrannosauroids | journal = Nature | volume=431 | issue=7009 |date=October 2004 | pages=680–4|bibcode = 2004Natur.431..680X }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, feathers indistinguishable from those of modern birds were soon after found in non-avialan dinosaurs as well.&lt;ref name = "jietal1998"/&gt;

A small minority of researchers have claimed that the simple filamentous "protofeather" structures are simply the result of the decomposition of collagen fiber under the dinosaurs' skin or in fins along their backs, and that species with unquestionable feathers, such as [[Oviraptorosauria|oviraptorosaurs]] and [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurs]] are not dinosaurs, but true birds unrelated to dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=feducciaetal2012&gt;Feduccia, A.

Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0-300-16435-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-300-16435-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a majority of studies have concluded that feathered dinosaurs are in fact dinosaurs, and that the simpler filaments of unquestionable theropods represent simple feathers. Some researchers have demonstrated the presence of color-bearing [[melanin]] in the structures—which would be expected in feathers but not collagen fibers.&lt;ref name=zhangetal2010&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=F. |author2=Kearns, S.L.; Orr, P.J.; Benton, M.J.; Zhou, Z.; Johnson, D.; Xu, X.; and Wang, X. |year=2010 |title=Fossilized melanosomes and the colour of Cretaceous dinosaurs and birds |journal=Nature |volume=463 |issue=7284 |pages=1075–1078 |doi=10.1038/nature08740 |pmid=20107440|bibcode=2010Natur.463.1075Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have demonstrated, using studies of modern bird decomposition, that even advanced feathers appear filamentous when subjected to the crushing forces experienced during fossilization, and that the supposed "protofeathers" may have been more complex than previously thought.&lt;ref name=foth2011&gt;Foth, C.

===Skeleton===
Because feathers are often associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the [[transitional fossil|missing link]] between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent the more important link for [[paleontology|paleontologists]]. Furthermore, it is increasingly clear that the relationship between birds and dinosaurs, and the evolution of flight, are more complex topics than previously realized. For example, while it was once believed that birds evolved from dinosaurs in one linear progression, some scientists, most notably [[Gregory S. Paul]], conclude that dinosaurs such as the [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurs]] may have evolved from birds, losing the power of flight while keeping their feathers in a manner similar to the modern [[ostrich]] and other [[ratite]]s.

Comparisons of bird and dinosaur skeletons, as well as [[cladistics|cladistic analysis]], strengthens the case for the link, particularly for a branch of theropods called [[maniraptora|maniraptors]]. Skeletal similarities include the neck, [[pubis (bone)|pubis]], [[wrist]] (semi-lunate [[carpus|carpal]]), arm and [[pectoral girdle]], [[scapula|shoulder blade]], [[furcula|clavicle]], and [[keel (bird)|breast bone]].

A study comparing embryonic, juvenile and adult [[archosaur]] skulls concluded that bird skulls are derived from those of [[theropod]] dinosaurs by [[progenesis]], a type of paedomorphic [[heterochrony]], which resulted in retention of juvenile characteristics of their ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bhullar | first1 = B.

===Lungs===
&lt;!-- ZoolJLinnSoc112 p389 --&gt;
Large meat-eating dinosaurs had a complex system of air sacs similar to those found in modern birds, according to an investigation led by Patrick M. O'Connor of [[Ohio University]]. In theropod dinosaurs (carnivores that walked on two legs and had birdlike feet) flexible soft tissue air sacs likely pumped air through the stiff lungs, as is the case in birds. "What was once formally considered unique to birds was present in some form in the ancestors of birds", O'Connor said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Connor | first1 = P.M. | last2 = Claessens | first2 = L.P.A.M. | year = 2005 | title = Basic avian pulmonary design and flow-through ventilation in non-avian theropod dinosaurs | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 436 | issue = 7048| doi=10.1038/nature03716 | pmid=16015329 | bibcode=2005Natur.436..253O | pages = 253–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paul C.

A study published in 2011 applied multiple lines of inquiry to the question of the object's identity, including more advanced CT scanning, [[histology]], [[X-ray scattering techniques|X-ray diffraction]], [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]], and [[scanning electron]] microscopy. From these methods, the authors found that: the object's internal structure does not include chambers but is made up of three unconnected areas of lower density material, and is not comparable to the structure of an [[ostrich]]'s heart; the "walls" are composed of [[sedimentary]] minerals not known to be produced in biological systems, such as goethite, [[feldspar]] minerals, [[quartz]], and [[gypsum]], as well as some plant fragments; [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], and [[phosphorus]], [[chemical element]]s important to life, were lacking in their samples; and cardiac cellular structures were absent. There was one possible patch with animal cellular structures. The authors found their data supported identification as a concretion of sand from the burial environment, not the heart, with the possibility that isolated areas of tissues were preserved.&lt;ref name=TCetal11&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cleland |first1=Timothy P. |author2=Stoskopf, Michael K.; and Schweitzer, Mary H. |title=Histological, chemical, and morphological reexamination of the "heart" of a small Late Cretaceous ''Thescelosaurus'' |journal=Naturwissenschaften |year=2011 |volume=98 |doi=10.1007/s00114-010-0760-1 |issue=3 |pages=203–211|bibcode = 2011NW.....98..203C |pmid=21279321 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of how this find reflects metabolic rate and dinosaur internal anatomy is moot, though, regardless of the object's identity.&lt;ref name=TCetal11/&gt; Both modern [[crocodilia]]ns and [[bird]]s, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, have four-chambered hearts (albeit modified in crocodilians), so dinosaurs probably had them as well; the structure is not necessarily tied to metabolic rate.&lt;ref name=CH04&gt;Chinsamy, Anusuya; and Hillenius, Willem J.

===Sleeping posture===
Fossils of the [[Troodontidae|troodonts]] ''[[Mei (dinosaur)|Mei]]'' and ''[[Sinornithoides]]'' demonstrate that the dinosaurs slept like certain modern birds, with their heads tucked under their arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature02898 | last1 = Xu | first1 = X. | last2 = Norell | first2 = M.A. | year = 2004 | title = A new troodontid dinosaur from China with avian-like sleeping posture | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 431 | issue = 7010| pages = 838–41 | pmid = 15483610 |bibcode = 2004Natur.431..838X}} [https://www.theguardian.com/life/news/story/0,12976,1326559,00.html See commentary on the article]&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds.

===Reproductive biology===
When laying eggs, female birds grow a special type of bone in their limbs. This [[medulla ossea|medullary]] bone forms as a calcium-rich layer inside the hard outer bone, and is used as a calcium source to make eggshells. The presence of endosteally derived bone tissues lining the interior marrow cavities of portions of a ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' specimen's hind limb suggested that ''T. rex'' used similar reproductive strategies, and revealed that the specimen is female.&lt;ref name="schweitzeretal2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schweitzer |first1=M.H. |author2=Wittmeyer, J.L.; and Horner, J.R. |year=2005 |title=Gender-specific reproductive tissue in ratites and ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' |journal=Science |volume=308 |pages=1456–60|doi=10.1126/science.1112158 |pmid=15933198 |issue=5727|bibcode = 2005Sci...308.1456S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research has found medullary bone in the theropod ''[[Allosaurus]]'' and ornithopod ''[[Tenontosaurus]]''. Because the line of dinosaurs that includes ''Allosaurus'' and ''Tyrannosaurus'' diverged from the line that led to ''Tenontosaurus'' very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that dinosaurs in general produced medullary tissue.&lt;ref name=LW08&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Andrew H. |author2=Werning, Sarah |year=2008 |title=Sexual maturity in growing dinosaurs does not fit reptilian growth models |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=582–7 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0708903105 |pmid=18195356 |pmc=2206579|bibcode = 2008PNAS..105..582L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brooding and care of young===
[[File:Citipati IGM 100 979.jpg|thumb|right|A nesting ''[[Citipati (dinosaur)|Citipati osmolskae]]'' specimen, at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City]]]]
Several ''[[Citipati (dinosaur)|Citipati]]'' specimens have been found resting over the eggs in its nest in a position most reminiscent of [[avian incubation|brooding]].&lt;ref name="NorellEtAl1994TheropodDinosaurEmbryo"&gt;{{cite journal |date=November 1994 |title=A theropod dinosaur embryo and the affinities of the Flaming Cliffs Dinosaur eggs |journal=Science |volume=266 |issue=5186 |pages=779–82 |doi=10.1126/science.266.5186.779 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/266/5186/779 |author=Norell, M.

Numerous dinosaur species, for example ''[[Maiasaura]]'', have been found in herds mixing both very young and adult individuals, suggesting rich interactions between them.

A dinosaur embryo was found without teeth, which suggests some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaur, possibly the adult dinosaur regurgitated food into the young dinosaur's mouth (''see'' [[altricial]]). This behaviour is seen in numerous bird species; parent birds regurgitate food into the hatchling's mouth.

===Gizzard stones===
Both birds and dinosaurs use [[gizzard]] stones. These stones are swallowed by animals to aid digestion and break down food and hard fibres once they enter the stomach. When found in association with [[fossil]]s, gizzard stones are called [[gastrolith]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wings O|title=A review of gastrolith function with implications for fossil vertebrates and a revised classification|journal=Palaeontologica Polonica|volume=52|issue=1|pages=1–16|year=2007|url=http://www.app.pan.pl/article/item/app52-001.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gizzard stones are also found in some fish ([[Mullet (fish)|mullets]], [[American gizzard shad|mud shad]], and the [[gillaroo]], a type of trout) and in crocodiles.

===Molecular evidence ===
On several occasions, the extraction of DNA and proteins from Mesozoic dinosaurs fossils has been claimed, allowing for a comparison with birds. Several [[protein]]s have putatively been detected in dinosaur fossils,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12952172 | last1 = Embery | first1 = G| doi=10.1080/03008200390152070 | last2 = Milner | first2 = AC | last3 = Waddington | first3 = RJ | last4 = Hall | first4 = RC | last5 = Langley | first5 = MS | last6 = Milan | first6 = AM | title = Identification of proteinaceous material in the bone of the dinosaur Iguanodon | journal = Connective tissue research | volume=44 |issue=Suppl 1 | year=2003 | pages=41–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[hemoglobin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9177210 | last1 = Schweitzer | pmc = 21042 | first1 = MH| doi=10.1073/pnas.94.12.6291 | last2 = Marshall | first2 = M | last3 = Carron | first3 = K | last4 = Bohle | first4 = DS | last5 = Busse | first5 = SC | last6 = Arnold | first6 = EV | last7 = Barnard | first7 = D | last8 = Horner | first8 = JR | last9 = Starkey | first9 = JR  | title = Heme compounds in dinosaur trabecular bone | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=94 | issue=12 |date=June 1997 | pages=6291–6|bibcode = 1997PNAS...94.6291S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of bird flight==
{{Main|Origin of avian flight}}
Debates about the origin of bird flight are almost as old as the idea that birds evolved from [[dinosaur]]s, which arose soon after the discovery of ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' in 1862. Two theories have dominated most of the discussion since then: the cursorial ("from the ground up") theory proposes that birds evolved from small, fast predators that ran on the ground; the arboreal ("from the trees down") theory proposes that powered flight evolved from unpowered gliding by arboreal (tree-climbing) animals. A more recent theory, "wing-assisted incline running" (WAIR), is a variant of the cursorial theory and proposes that wings developed their [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] functions as a result of the need to run quickly up very steep slopes such as trees, which would help small feathered dinosaurs escape from predators.

In March 2018, scientists reported that ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' was likely capable of [[Bird flight|flight]], but in a manner substantially different from that of [[Birds|modern birds]].&lt;ref name="NAT-20180313"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Voeten, Dennis F.A.E. et al. |title=Wing bone geometry reveals active flight in Archaeopteryx |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03296-8 |date=13 March 2018 |journal=[[Nature Communications]] |number=923 |doi=10.1038/s41467-018-03296-8 |accessdate=13 March 2018 |bibcode=2018NatCo...9..923V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WP-20180313"&gt;{{cite news |last=Guarino |first=Ben |title=This feathery dinosaur probably flew, but not like any bird you know |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2018/03/13/this-feathery-dinosaur-probably-flew-but-not-like-any-bird-you-know/ |date=13 March 2018 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=13 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cursorial ("from the ground up") theory===
[[File:Rahonavis NT.jpg|thumb|right |Reconstruction of ''[[Rahonavis]]'', a ground-dwelling feathered dinosaur that some researchers think was well equipped for flight]]
The cursorial theory of the origin of flight was first proposed by [[Samuel Wendell Williston]], and elaborated upon by [[Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás|Baron Nopcsa]]. This hypothesis proposes that some fast-running animals with long tails used their arms to keep their balance while running. Modern versions of this theory differ in many details from the Williston-Nopcsa version, mainly as a result of discoveries since Nopcsa's time.

Nopcsa theorized that increasing the surface area of the outstretched arms could have helped small cursorial predators keep their balance, and that the scales of the forearms elongated, [[evolution|evolving]] into feathers. The feathers could also have been used to trap insects or other prey. Progressively, the animals leapt for longer distances, helped by their evolving wings. Nopcsa also proposed three stages in the evolution of flight. First, animals developed passive flight, in which developing wing structures served as a sort of [[parachute]]. Second, they achieved active flight by flapping the wings. He used ''Archaeopteryx'' as an example of this second stage. Finally, birds gained the ability to soar.&lt;ref name="Terres"&gt;{{cite book|last=Terres|first=John K.|authorlink=John Kenneth Terres|title=The Audubon Society Encyclopedia of North American Birds|publisher=Knopf|year=1980|location=New York, NY|pages=398–401|doi= |isbn=0-394-46651-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flight stages.jpg|thumb|left|Proposed development of flight in a book from 1922: Tetrapteryx, ''Archaeopteryx'', Hypothetical Stage, Modern Bird]]
Current thought is that feathers did not evolve from scales, as feathers are made of different [[protein]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/archie/scutes.htm |title=Feathers, scutes and the origin of birds |author=Poling, J. |year=1996 |publisher=dinosauria.com |access-date=2008-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402065705/http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/archie/scutes.htm |archive-date=2008-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; More seriously, Nopcsa's theory assumes that feathers evolved as part of the evolution of flight, and recent discoveries prove that assumption is false.

Most recent refutations of the "from the ground up" hypothesis attempt to refute the modern version's assumption that birds are modified coelurosaurian dinosaurs. The strongest attacks are based on [[Embryology|embryological analyses]] that conclude that birds' wings are formed from digits 2, 3, and 4, (corresponding to the index, middle, and ring fingers in humans. The first of a bird's three digits forms the [[Flight feather#Alula|alula]], which they use to avoid [[Stall (flight)|stalling]] in low-speed flight—for example, when landing).

The [[wing-assisted incline running]] (WAIR) hypothesis was prompted by observation of young [[Chukar Partridge|chukar]] chicks, and proposes that wings developed their [[aerodynamic]] functions as a result of the need to run quickly up very steep slopes such as tree trunks, for example to escape from predators.&lt;ref name="YouTubeWAIR"&gt;There is a video clip of a very young chick doing this at {{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNxt_-f9dmw&amp;feature=related |title=Wing assisted incline running and evolution of flight}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it a specialized type of cursorial ("from the ground up") theory.

===Arboreal ("from the trees down") theory===
[[File:Microraptor gui (dinos).jpg|thumb|right|The four-winged ''[[Microraptor]]'', a member of the Dromaeosauridae, a group of dinosaurs closely related to birds]]
Most versions of the arboreal hypothesis state that the ancestors of birds were very small dinosaurs that lived in trees, springing from branch to branch. This small dinosaur already had feathers, which were co-opted by evolution to produce longer, stiffer forms that were useful in aerodynamics, eventually producing wings. Wings would have then evolved and become increasingly refined as devices to give the leaper more control, to parachute, to glide, and to fly in stepwise fashion. The arboreal hypothesis also notes that, for arboreal animals, aerodynamics are far more energy efficient, since such animals simply fall to achieve minimum gliding speeds.&lt;ref name="Chatterjee2004"&gt;Chatterjee, Sankar, Templin, R.J. (2004)  "Feathered coelurosaurs from China: new light on the arboreal origin of avian flight"  pp. 251-281. In Feathered Dragons: Studies on the Transition from Dinosaurs to Birds (P. J. Currie, E. B. Koppelhus, M. A. Shugar, and J. L. Wright (eds.).  Indiana University Press, Bloomington.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trasitano2000&gt;Samuel F. Tarsitano, Anthony P.

Several small dinosaurs from the Jurassic or Early Cretaceous, all with feathers, have been interpreted as possibly having arboreal and/or aerodynamic adaptations. These include ''[[Scansoriopteryx]]'', ''[[Epidexipteryx]]'', ''[[Microraptor]]'', ''[[Pedopenna]]'', and ''[[Anchiornis]]''. ''Anchiornis'' is particularly important to this subject, as it lived at the beginning of the Late Jurassic, long before ''Archaeopteryx''.&lt;ref name="Hu et al.2009"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hu |first=D. |last2=Hou |first2=L. |last3=Zhang |first3=L. |last4=Xu |first4=X. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2009 |title=A pre-''Archaeopteryx'' troodontid theropod from China with long feathers on the metatarsus |journal=Nature |volume=461 |issue=7264 |pages=640–3 |doi=10.1038/nature08322 |issn= |pmid=19794491 |bibcode=2009Natur.461..640H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of the proportions of the toe bones of the most primitive birds ''Archaeopteryx'' and ''[[Confuciusornis]]'', compared to those of living species, suggest that the early species may have lived both on the ground and in trees.&lt;ref name=Hopson2001&gt;Hopson, James A.

One study suggested that the earliest birds and their immediate ancestors did not climb trees. This study determined that the amount of toe claw curvature of early birds was more like that seen in modern ground-foraging birds than in perching birds.&lt;ref name="GlenBennett2007ForagingModes"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Foraging modes of Mesozoic birds and non-avian theropods |volume=17 |date=November 2007 |url=http://www.current-biology.com/content/article/abstract?uid=PIIS0960982207019859 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121208141906/http://www.current-biology.com/content/article/abstract?uid=PIIS0960982207019859 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-08 |author1=Glen, C.L. |author2=Bennett, M.B. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Current Biology |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.09.026 |issue=21 |pages=R911–2 |pmid=17983564 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diminished significance of ''Archaeopteryx''===
''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' was the first and for a long time the only known feathered [[Mesozoic]] animal. As a result, discussion of the evolution of birds and of bird flight centered on ''Archaeopteryx'' at least until the mid-1990s.
[[File:WingMuscles.svg|thumb|left|The supracoracoideus works using a pulley-like system to lift the wing while the pectorals provide the powerful downstroke.]]
There has been debate about whether ''Archaeopteryx'' could really fly. It appears that ''Archaeopteryx'' had the brain structures and inner-ear balance sensors that birds use to control their flight.&lt;ref name="AlonsoMilnerEtAl2004AvianBrainInnerEarArchaeopteryx"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The avian nature of the brain and inner ear of Archaeopteryx |journal=Nature |volume=430 |issue=7000 |pages=666–9|date=August 2004 |doi=10.1038/nature02706 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v430/n7000/full/nature02706.html |author=Alonso, P.D., Milner, A.C., Ketcham, R.A., Cokson, M.J and Rowe, T.B. |pmid=15295597 |bibcode=2004Natur.430..666A}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Archaeopteryx'' also had a wing feather arrangement like that of modern birds and similarly asymmetrical flight feathers on its wings and tail. But ''Archaeopteryx'' lacked the [[Bird anatomy#Muscular system|shoulder mechanism]] by which modern birds' wings produce swift, powerful upstrokes (see diagram above of supracoracoideus pulley); this may mean that it and other early birds were incapable of flapping flight and could only glide.&lt;ref name="Senter2006ScapularOrientation"/&gt;

But the discovery since the early 1990s of many [[feathered dinosaurs]] means that ''Archaeopteryx'' is no longer the key figure in the evolution of bird flight. Other small feathered coelurosaurs from the [[Cretaceous]] and Late [[Jurassic]] show possible precursors of avian flight. These include ''[[Rahonavis]]'', a ground-runner with a ''[[Velociraptor]]''-like raised sickle claw on the second toe, that some paleontologists assume to have been better adapted for flight than ''Archaeopteryx'',&lt;ref name="Chiappe2007GlorifiedDinosaurs"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chiappe|first=L.M.|title=Glorified Dinosaurs: The Origin and Early Evolution of Birds|location=Sydney|publisher=UNSW Press|isbn=0-471-24723-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Scansoriopteryx]]'', an arboreal dinosaur that may support the "from the trees down" theory,&lt;ref name="zhang2002"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2002 |title=A juvenile coelurosaurian theropod from China indicates arboreal habits |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=89 |issue=9 |pages=394–8 |doi=10.1007/s00114-002-0353-8 |author=Zhang, F., Zhou, Z., Xu, X. &amp; Wang, X. |pmid=12435090|bibcode = 2002NW.....89..394Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Microraptor]]'', an arboreal dinosaur possibly capable of powered flight but, if so, more like a [[biplane]], as it had well-developed feathers on its legs.&lt;ref name="chatterjee2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Chatterjee | first1=S | last2=Templin | first2=RJ | title=Biplane wing planform and flight performance of the feathered dinosaur Microraptor gui | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=104 | issue=5 | pages= 1576–80 | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/0609975104v1.pdf | year=2007 | pmid=17242354 | pmc=1780066 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0609975104 | bibcode=2007PNAS..104.1576C}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1915, some scientists argued that the evolution of bird flight may have gone through a four-winged (or ''tetrapteryx'') stage.&lt;ref name="beebe1915"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beebe | first1 = C. W.

&lt;!-- What's this about? Is it claiming birds are polyphyletic? And why specifically "ancestors of Neornithes"? Or is it suggesting Archaeopteryx is no longer the central character (a reasonable idea).
[[Exaptation]]s for true avian flight, as opposed to gliding or four-winged flight, apparently evolved in a group of closely related species. These then evolved into different lineages, each featuring a slightly different approach to the challenge, and probably were well advanced in this process already by the time of ''Archaeopteryx''. Thus, the question might be rephrased more accurately: "did the ancestors of [[Neornithes]] develop flight from the ground up or from trees (slopes, cliffs...) down?"

&lt;/div&gt;Simplified cladogram from Mayr ''et al.'' (2005)&lt;br /&gt;Groups usually regarded as birds are in bold type.&lt;ref name=mayretal2005/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

A hypothesis, credited to [[Gregory Paul]] and propounded in his books ''Predatory Dinosaurs of the World'' (1988) and ''Dinosaurs of the Air'' (2002), suggests that some groups of non-flying carnivorous dinosaurs - especially [[deinonychosaur]]s, but perhaps others such as [[oviraptorosauria|oviraptorosaurs]], [[therizinosaur]]s, [[alvarezsauridae|alvarezsaurids]] and [[ornithomimosauria|ornithomimosaurs]] - actually descend from birds. Paul also proposed that the bird ancestor of these groups was more advanced in its flight adaptations than ''[[Archaeopteryx]]''. The hypothesis would mean that ''Archaeopteryx'' is less closely related to extant birds than these dinosaurs are.&lt;ref name=Paul2002&gt;Paul, G.S. (2002). "Dinosaurs of the Air: The Evolution and Loss of Flight in Dinosaurs and Birds." Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. page 257&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul's hypothesis received additional support when Mayr ''et al.'' (2005) analyzed a new, tenth specimen of ''Archaeopteryx'', and concluded that ''Archaeopteryx'' was the sister clade to the Deinonychosauria, but that the more  advanced bird ''[[Confuciusornis]]'' was within the Dromaeosauridae. This result supports Paul's hypothesis, suggesting that the Deinonychosauria and the Troodontidae are part of Aves, the bird lineage proper, and secondarily flightless.&lt;ref name=MayrPetersSept2006&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mayr | first1=G. | title=Response to Comment on ''A Well-Preserved Archaeopteryx Specimen with Theropod Features''| journal = Science | volume= 313 | year= 2006 |page= 1238c | doi = 10.1126/science.1130964 | issue=5791 |bibcode = 2006Sci...313.1238M }}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper, however, excluded all other birds and thus did not sample their character distributions. The paper was criticized by Corfe and Butler (2006) who found the authors could not support their conclusions statistically. Mayr ''et al.'' agreed that the statistical support was weak, but added that it is also weak for the alternative scenarios.&lt;ref name="CorfeButler2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Corfe | first1=I. J. | title=Comment on ''A Well- Preserved Archaeopteryx Specimen With Theropod Features'' | journal= Science | volume= 313 | pages=1238b–1238b | year=2006 | doi = 10.1126/science.1130800 | pmid=16946054 | issue=5791 | last2=Butler | first2=RJ|bibcode = 2006Sci...313.1238C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current [[cladistic analysis|cladistic analyses]] do not support Paul's hypothesis about the position of ''Archaeopteryx''. Instead, they indicate that ''Archaeopteryx'' is closer to birds, within the clade ''[[Avialae]]'', than it is to deinonychosaurs or oviraptorosaurs. However, some fossils support the version of this theory that holds that some non-flying carnivorous dinosaurs may have had flying ancestors. In particular, ''[[Microraptor]]'', ''[[Pedopenna]]'', and ''[[Anchiornis]]'' all have winged feet, share many features, and lie close to the base of the clade [[Paraves]]. This suggests that the ancestral paravian was a four-winged glider, and that larger Deinonychosaurs secondarily lost the ability to glide, while the bird lineage increased in aerodynamic ability as it progressed.&lt;ref name=Witmer2009&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Witmer | first1= LM | title= Palaeontology: Feathered dinosaurs in a tangle | journal= Nature | volume= 461 | issue= 7264 | pages= 601–2 | year= 2009 | pmid = 19794481 | doi= 10.1038/461601a |bibcode = 2009Natur.461..601W }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Deinonychus]]'' may also display partial volancy, with the young being capable of flight or gliding and the adults being flightless.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, William L.; Parsons, Kristen M. (2015). "Morphological Variations within the Ontogeny of Deinonychus antirrhopus (Theropoda, Dromaeosauridae)". PLoS ONE 10 (4). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0121476. e0121476.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, a study concluded that the last common ancestor of the [[Pennaraptora]] had joint surfaces on the fingers, and between the metatarsus and the wrist, that were optimised to stabilise the hand in flight. This was seen as an indication for secondary flightlessness in heavy basal members of that group.&lt;ref&gt;Joel D. Hutson &amp; Kelda N. Hutson, 2018, "Retention of the flight-adapted avian finger-joint complex in the Ostrich helps identify when wings began evolving in dinosaurs", ''Ostrich: Journal of African Ornithology'' DOI: 10.2989/00306525.2017.1422566&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''reticle''', or '''reticule''' ({{ety|la|reticulum|net}}), also known as a '''graticule''' ({{ety|la|craticula|[[Gridiron (cooking)|gridiron]]}}), is a pattern of fine lines or markings built into the eyepiece of a sighting device, such as a [[telescopic sight]] in a telescope, a microscope, or the screen of an oscilloscope, to provide measurement references during visual examination. Today, engraved lines or embedded fibers may be replaced by a computer-generated image superimposed on a screen or eyepiece. Both terms may be used to describe any set of lines used for optical measurement, but in modern use ''reticle'' is most commonly used for gunsights and such, while ''graticule'' is more widely used for the [[oscilloscope#Graticule|oscilloscope display]], [[microscope slide]]s, and similar roles.
[[File:ПД-8 (ПД-8А).jpg|thumb| Reticle accessory (PD-8) used in sniper rifles]]
There are many variations of reticles; this article concerns itself mainly with a simple reticle: '''crosshairs'''. Crosshairs are most commonly represented as intersecting lines in the shape of a cross,  "+", though many variations exist, including dots, [[Vertical bar|posts]], [[Concentric|circles]], scales, [[Chevron (insignia)|chevrons]], or a combination of these. Most commonly associated with telescopic sights for aiming [[firearm]]s, crosshairs are also common in optical instruments used for astronomy and surveying, and are also popular in [[graphical user interface]]s as a precision [[cursor (computers)|pointer]]. The reticle is said to have been invented by [[Robert Hooke]], and dates to the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;

==Use==

===Firearms===

Telescopic sights for firearms, generally just called ''scopes'', are probably the device most often associated with crosshairs. [[Motion picture]]s and the media often use a view through crosshairs as a dramatic device, which has given crosshairs wide cultural exposure.

====Reticle shape====
While the traditional thin crossing lines are the original and still the most familiar cross-hair shape, they are really best suited for precision aiming at high contrast targets, as the thin lines are easily lost in complex backgrounds, such as those encountered while hunting. Thicker bars are much easier to discern against a complex background, but lack the precision of thin bars. The most popular types of cross-hair in modern scopes are variants on the ''duplex'' cross-hair, with bars that are thick on the perimeter and thin out in the middle.  The thick bars allow the eye to quickly locate the center of the reticle, and the thin lines in the center allow for precision aiming. The thin bars in a duplex reticle may also be designed to be used as a measure. Called a 30/30 reticle, the thin bars on such a reticle span 30 minutes of arc (0.5º), which is approximately equal to 30 inches at 100 yards. This enables an experienced shooter to deduce, on the basis of the known size of an object in view, (as opposed to guess or estimate) the range within an acceptable error limit.

====Wire crosshairs====
[[File:Findot reticle 2.png|thumb|right|Etched "FinnDot" reticle (a regular [[milliradian|mil]]-dot reticle with the addition of 400 m – 1200 m holdover [[stadiametric rangefinding|(stadiametric) rangefinding]] brackets for 1 meter high or 0.5 meter wide targets at 400, 600, 800, 1000 and 1200 m). Reticle illumination is provided by a tritium ampoule embedded in the elevation turret.]]

Originally crosshairs were constructed out of hair or spiderweb, these materials being sufficiently thin and strong. Many modern scopes use wire crosshairs, which can be flattened to various degrees to change the width. These wires are usually silver in color, but appear black when backlit by the image passing through the scope's optics. Wire reticles are by nature fairly simple, as they require lines that pass all the way across the reticle, and the shapes are limited to the variations in thickness allowed by flattening the wire; duplex crosshairs, and crosshairs with dots are possible, and multiple horizontal or vertical lines may be used. The advantage of wire crosshairs is that they are fairly tough and durable, and provide no obstruction to light passing through the scope.

====Etched reticles====
[[Image:USGsight01.jpg|thumb |alt=The day and low-light reticles of the USG reflex sight used on the FN P90 / PS90 USG models |The day and low-light reticles of the integral [[reflex sight]] used on the [[FN P90]] / PS90 USG models]] 

The first suggestion for etched glass reticles was made by [[Philippe de La Hire]] in 1700.&lt;ref name="daumas"&gt;Maurice Daumas, ''Scientific Instruments of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries and Their Makers'', Portman Books, London 1989  {{ISBN|978-0-7134-0727-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; His method was based on engraving the lines on a glass plate with a [[diamond]] point. Many modern crosshairs are actually [[Industrial etching|etch]]ed onto a thin plate of [[glass]], which allows a far greater latitude in shapes. Etched glass reticles can have ''floating'' elements, which do not cross the reticle; circles and dots are common, and some types of glass reticles have complex sections designed for use in [[Stadiametric rangefinding|range estimation]] and bullet drop and drift compensation (see [[external ballistics]]). A potential disadvantage of glass reticles is that they are less durable than wire crosshairs, and the surface of the glass reflects some light (about 4% per surface on uncoated glass&lt;ref&gt;Richard Feynman, the red books&lt;/ref&gt;) lessening transmission through the scope, although this light loss is near zero if the glass is multicoated (coating being the norm for all modern high quality optical products).

====Illuminated reticles====
Reticles may be illuminated, either by a plastic or [[fiber optic]] [[light pipe]] collecting ambient light or, in low light conditions, by a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] powered [[LED]]. Some sights also use the radioactive decay of [[tritium]] for illumination that can work for 11 years without using a battery, used in the British [[SUSAT]] sight for the [[SA80]] (L85) assault rifle and in the American [[Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight|ACOG (Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight)]]. Red is the most common color used, as it is the least destructive to the shooter's [[night vision]], but some products use green or yellow illumination, either as a single colour or changeable via user selection.

====Graticule====
A graticule is another term for reticle, frequently encountered in British and British military technical manuals, and came into common use during World War One.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofappl00glazmiss#page/120/mode/2up  Glazebrook, Sir Richard, A Dictionary of Applied Physics, Macmillan and Co., London, 1923.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reticle focal plane===
The reticle may be located at the front or rear focal plane (First Focal Plane (FFP) or Second Focal Plane (SFP)) of the telescopic sight. On fixed power telescopic sights there is no significant difference, but on variable power telescopic sights the front plane reticle remains at a constant size compared to the target, while rear plane reticles remain a constant size to the user as the target image grows and shrinks. Front focal plane reticles are slightly more durable, but most American users prefer that the reticle remains constant as the image changes size, so nearly all modern American variable power telescopic sights are rear focal plane designs. American and European high end optics manufacturers often leave the customer the choice between a FFP or SFP mounted reticle.

====Collimated reticles====
[[File:Reflector reflex sight diagram 3.png|thumb|right|Diagram of three types of reflector sights that produce collimated reticles. The top uses a collimating lens (CL) and a beam splitter (B) to create a  [[virtual image]] at infinity (V) of a reticle (R). The bottom two use half silvered curved mirrors (CM) as the collimating optics with the reticle off-set or between the mirror and the observer.]]
{{main|Reflector sight}}
Collimated reticles are produced by non-magnifying optical devices such as [[reflector sight]]s (often called ''reflex sights'') that give the viewer an image of the reticle superimposed over the field of view, and blind [[collimator sight]]s that are used with both eyes. Collimated reticles are created using [[refraction|refractive]] or [[reflection (physics)|reflective]] [[Collimator#Optical collimators|optical collimators]] to generate a [[Collimated light|collimated]] image of an illuminated or reflective reticle. These types of sights are used on surveying/triangulating equipment, to aid celestial telescope aiming, and as [[gunsights|sight]]s on [[firearm]]s.  Historically they were used on larger military weapon systems that could supply an electrical source to illuminate them and where the operator needed a wide field of view to track and range a moving target visually (i.e. weapons from the pre [[laser]]/[[radar]]/[[computer]] era). More recently sights using low power consumption durable [[light emitting diode]]s as the reticle (called ''[[red dot sight]]''s) have become common on small arms with versions like the [[Aimpoint CompM2]] being widely fielded by the U.S. Military.

====Holographic reticles====
[[Holographic weapon sight]]s use a [[hologram|holographic]] image of a reticle at finite set range built into the viewing window and a [[collimated light|collimated]] [[laser diode]] to illuminate it.  An advantage to holographic sights is that they eliminate a type of [[parallax]] problem found  in some optical collimator based sights (such as the [[red dot sight]]) where the spherical mirror used induces [[spherical aberration]] that can cause the reticle to skew off the sight's [[optical axis]]. The use of a hologram also eliminates the need for image dimming narrow band reflective coatings and allows for reticles of almost any shape or [[milliradian|mil]] size. A downside to the holographic weapon sight can be the weight and shorter battery life. As with red dot sights, holographic weapon sights have also become common on small arms with versions like the [[EOTech|Eotech]] 512.A65 and similar models fielded by the U.S. Military&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/Holographic-Sights-for-SOCOM-M4s-06416/ |title=Holographic Sights for SOCOM M4s |deadurl=no |accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and various law enforcement agencies.

===Surveying and astronomy===
In older instruments, reticle crosshairs and stadia marks were made using threads taken from the [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]] of the [[brown recluse spider]]. This very fine, strong spider silk makes for an excellent crosshair.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Davis, Francis Foote, Joe Kelly, ''Surveying, Theory and Practice'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1966 LC 64-66263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berenbaum, May R., ''Field Notes - Spin Control'', The Sciences, The New York Academy Of Sciences, September/October 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

====Surveying====
In surveying, reticles are designed for specific uses. [[Dumpy level|Level]]s and [[theodolite]]s would have slightly different reticles. However, both may have features such as [[stadia mark]]s to allow distance measurements.

====Astronomy====
For astronomical uses, reticles could be simple crosshair designs or more elaborate designs for special purposes. Telescopes used for [[polar alignment]] could have a reticle that indicates the position of [[Polaris]] relative to the north celestial pole. Telescopes that are used for very precise measurements would have a [[filar micrometer]] as a reticle; this could be adjusted by the operator to measure angular distances between stars.

For aiming telescopes, [[reflex sight]]s are popular, often in conjunction with a small telescope with a crosshair reticle. They make aiming the telescope at an [[astronomical object]] easier.

The constellation [[Reticulum]] was designated to recognize the reticle and its contributions to astronomy.

This article will be discussing the rules and regulation of [[shale gas]]. There are going to be four major topics that surround the issues of the rules and regulations regarding shale gas. Safeguards and loopholes, environmental assessments, monitoring and mitigating, and Canadian deregulation and international governance. These four issues will be the main focus of the article

== Safeguards and loopholes==
{{Empty section|date=April 2014}}

== Environmental assessments==
{{Empty section|date=April 2014}}

== Monitoring and mitigating==

Monitoring and mitigating of shale gas is referring to making sure that there is no potential danger to the environment. There are several problems that can occur when focusing on shale gas ([[hydraulic fracturing|fracking]]). Air, land and water resource are usually the main issues when it comes to fracking and Shale Gas.

===Air===

NETL (National Energy Technology Laboratory) will monitor ambient air quality at the Washington County site using a mobile air quality monitoring laboratory. NETL also will conduct targeted on-site measurements of air emissions during well development and production activities and use collected data in atmospheric chemistry and transport models to further understanding of local and regional air quality impacts.&lt;ref name=guthrie&gt;{{cite web|last=Guthrie|first=George|title=Monitoring of Air, Land, and Water  Resources during Shale Gas Production |url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/factsheets/rd/R&amp;D167.pdf|publisher=NETL|accessdate=April 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Completed - Almost eight months of pre-development air quality data were acquired at this location before the air monitoring laboratory was moved to the Greene County site in March 2012.&lt;ref name=guthrie /&gt; 
 
Planned - The mobile air quality monitoring laboratory will return to the Washington County site when construction at the location commences (timing depends on industry partner).&lt;ref name=guthrie /&gt;
 
===Land===

The Australian Greens stand firmly on the side of Australian farmers. We want farmers to have a right to refuse access to mining and gas companies on their land. Currently, under state, territory and federal laws, most landholders have no right to refuse mining and gas companies access to explore and then later, mine or frack their land. The Greens are the only party to realise that supporting our farmers and protecting our prime agricultural land and water is vital for our future food security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waters|first=Larissa|title=PROTECT OUR LAND AND WATER  NO SHALE GAS FRACKING IN WA The Greens’ plan to protect land, water, climate and communities|url=http://larissa-waters.greensmps.org.au/sites/default/files/shale_gas_policy_initiative.pdf|publisher=The Greens|accessdate=April 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water resources===
Monitoring ground water is a major concern, there are many individuals that are clamming that their water is being contaminated from chemicals that are coming from hydraulic fracturing. A frequently expressed concern about shale gas development is that subsurface hydraulic fracturing operations in deep shale formations might create fractures that extend well beyond the target formation to water aquifers, allowing methane, contaminants naturally occurring in formation water, and fracturing fluids to migrate from the target formation into drinking water supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Zoback, Mark; Kitasei, Saya; and Copithorne, Brad |title=Addressing the Environmental Risks from Shale Gas Development |date=July 2010 |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/Hydraulic%20Fracturing%20Paper.pdf|publisher= World watch Institute|accessdate=April 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protecting water====

Regulation of the Canadian oil and gas sector is designed to protect drinking water and water quality in our lakes and streams. The specific regulations vary between jurisdictions but in all cases, Canadian natural gas production always isolates and protects drinking water (groundwater) from natural gas operations.&lt;ref name=capp&gt;{{cite web|title=Shale Gas|url=http://www.capp.ca/canadaIndustry/naturalGas/ShaleGas/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers |date=n.d. |accessdate=April 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Alberta for example, regulation requires that natural gas development provide an extensive barrier (both vertically and laterally) between any shallow stimulation interval and existing water wells, in addition to isolating the aquifer and the fractured zone. Alberta has also increased the focus on water well education and standards in oil and gas producing areas.&lt;ref name=capp /&gt;

===Types of monitoring===

Phased Environmental Impact Assessments- This is a process which New Brunswick oil, shale gas and natural gas companies are required to register for their projects before taking action. The process will identify potential environmental impacts at the early stages before a project is implemented so that negative environmental impacts can be avoided or reduced to an acceptable level.&lt;ref name=gnb&gt;{{cite web|title=Oil, Shale Gas and Natural Gas exploration in New Brunswick|url=http://www2.gnb.ca/content/dam/gnb/Departments/env/pdf/Publications/OilShaleGasNaturalGasExploration.pdf|publisher=New Brunswick Department of Environment 2011|accessdate=March 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phased EIA registration====

* location of proposed drill targets;
* description existing environment within the drill target areas including environmental constraints (wetlands, watercourses, wildlife resources and habitat), location of sensitive areas and additional proposed exploration activities;
* details about the construction and operation of the well pads, access roads and associated infrastructure;
* details associated with drilling activities;
* details regarding waste management;
* process and potable water requirements and water sources;
* material handling and shipping;
* sewage treatment facilities;
* Any past, current, or future projects or activities in the project area whose effects may interact with those of the project under review;  commercial extraction, pipelines, gas processing or well decommissioning;
* and any other applicable details/aspects of the project as the project develops.&lt;ref name=gnb /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5103">'''Sturgeon's revelation''' (as originally expounded by [[Theodore Sturgeon]]), commonly referred to as '''Sturgeon's law''', is an [[adage]] commonly cited as "ninety percent of everything is crap". It is derived from quotations by Sturgeon, an American [[science fiction author]] and critic; while Sturgeon coined another adage that he termed "Sturgeon's law", it is the "ninety percent crap" remark that is usually referred to by that term.

The phrase was derived from Sturgeon's observation that while science fiction was often derided for its low quality by critics, the majority of examples of [[artistic work|works]] in other fields could equally be seen to be of low quality, and that science fiction was thus no different in that regard from other art forms.

== History ==
A similar adage appears in [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Light that Failed]]'', published in 1890. "Four-fifths of everybody's work must be bad. But the remnant is worth the trouble for its own sake."&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Writings in Prose and Verse of Rudyard Kipling|author=Rudyard, K.|isbn=9785874724696|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kRELAwAAQBAJ|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first written reference to the adage appears in the March 1958 issue of ''[[Venture Science Fiction Magazine|Venture]]'', where Sturgeon wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I repeat Sturgeon's Revelation, which was wrung out of me after twenty years of wearying defense of science fiction against attacks of people who used the worst examples of the field for ammunition, and whose conclusion was that ninety percent of SF is crud. Using the same standards that categorize 90% of science fiction as trash, crud, or crap, it can be argued that 90% of film, literature, consumer goods, etc. is crap. In other words, the claim (or fact) that 90% of science fiction is crap is ultimately uninformative, because science fiction conforms to the same trends of quality as all other artforms.&lt;ref name="venture" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Philip Klass ([[William Tenn]]), Sturgeon made this remark circa 1951, at a talk at [[New York University]] attended by Tenn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/328 |title=&amp;#39;SF Citations for OED&amp;#39; |publisher=Jessesword.com |date=6 July 2008 |accessdate=6 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310213832/http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/328 |archivedate=10 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement was subsequently included in a talk Sturgeon gave at a 1953 [[Labor Day]] weekend  session of the [[World Science Fiction Convention]] in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.emory.edu/~weeks/misc/slaw.html|title=James Gunn, 'Addendum: Sturgeon's Law' |publisher=Physics.emory.edu |date= |accessdate=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] championed Sturgeon's law as one of his seven tools for critical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openculture.com/2013/05/philosopher_daniel_dennett_presents_seven_tools_for_critical_thinking.html |title=Daniel Dennett Presents Seven Tools For Critical Thinking&amp;#39; |date=21 May 2013 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "90% of everything is crap.  That is true, whether you are talking about physics, chemistry, evolutionary psychology, sociology, medicine—you name it—rock music, country western.  90% of everything is crap."  Its re-introduction to a modern audience received a positive reception, according to Dennett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/daniel_dennett_tools_for_thinking/ |title=Point of Inquiry | quote=Audio segment starting at minute 39|date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The original Sturgeon's law ==
Sturgeon had originally deemed Sturgeon's law to mean that "nothing is always absolutely so" in the story "The Claustrophile" in a 1956 issue of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"The Claustrophile", ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]'' August 1956&lt;/ref&gt; The second adage, variously rendered as "ninety percent of everything is crud" or "ninety percent of everything is crap", was originally known as "Sturgeon's Revelation", formulated as such in his book review column for ''[[Venture Science Fiction Magazine|Venture]]''&lt;ref name="venture"&gt;''[[Venture Science Fiction Magazine|Venture]]'' 49, September 1957&lt;/ref&gt; in 1957. However, almost all modern uses of the term Sturgeon's law actually refer to the second, including the definition listed in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.

{{Sound change}}
In [[phonology]], '''syncope''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|ŋ|k|ə|p|i}}; from {{lang-grc|{{wt|grc|συγκοπή}}|{{grc-tr|συγκοπή}}|cutting up}}) is the loss of one or more sounds from the interior of a word, especially the loss of an unstressed vowel. It is found both in [[synchronic analysis]] of languages and [[diachronics]]. Its opposite, whereby sounds are added, is [[epenthesis]].

== Synchronic analysis ==
Synchronic analysis studies linguistic phenomena at one [[moment (time)|moment]], usually the present. In modern languages, syncope occurs in [[inflection]], [[poetry]], and informal speech.

=== Inflections ===
In languages such as [[Irish language|Irish]], the process of [[inflection]] can cause syncope:

* In some verbs
: {{lang|ga|imir}} (to play) should become *{{lang|ga|imirím}} (I play). However, the addition of the {{lang|ga|-ím}} causes syncope and the second-last syllable vowel {{lang|ga|i}} is lost so {{lang|ga|imirim}} becomes {{lang|ga|imrím}}.
* In some nouns
: {{lang|ga|inis}} (island) should become *{{lang|ga|inise}} in the [[genitive case]]. However, instead of *{{lang|ga|Baile na hInise}}, road signs say, {{lang|ga|Baile na hInse}} (the town of the island). Once again, there is the loss of the second {{lang|ga|i}}.

If the present root form in Irish is the result of diachronic syncope, there is a resistance to synchronic syncope for [[inflection]].

=== As a poetic device ===
Sounds may be removed from the interior of a word as a rhetorical or poetic device: for embellishment or for the sake of the meter.

* Latin {{wikt-lang|la|commōverat}} &gt; poetic {{lang|la|commōrat}} ("he had moved")
* English ''hastening'' &gt; poetic ''hast'ning''
* English ''heaven'' &gt; poetic ''heav'n''
* English ''over'' &gt; poetic ''o'er''
* English ''ever'' &gt; poetic ''e'er'', often confused with ''ere'' ("before")

===Informal speech===
Various sorts of colloquial reductions might be called "syncope" or "compression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary |edition=2nd |first=John C. |last=Wells |authorlink=John C. Wells |year=2000 |publisher=[[Longman]] |isbn=0-582-36467-1 |pages=165–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forms such as "didn't" that are written with an apostrophe are, however, generally called [[contraction (grammar)|contractions]]:

* English ''Australian'' &gt; colloquial ''[[Strine]]'', pronounced {{IPAc-en|s|t|r|aɪ|n}}
* English ''did not'' &gt; ''didn't'', pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɪ|d|ən|t}}
* English ''I would have'' &gt; ''I'd've'', pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|d|ə|v}}
* English ''going to'' &gt; colloquial ''gonna'' (generally only when unstressed and when expressing intention rather than direction), pronounced {{IPAc-en|ɡ|ə|n|ə}} or, before a vowel, {{IPAc-en|ɡ|ə|n|u}}

== Diachronic analysis ==
In historical phonology, the term "syncope" is often limited to the loss of an unstressed vowel, in effect collapsing the syllable that contained it: trisyllabic Latin ''calidus'' (stress on first syllable) develops as bisyllabic ''caldo'' in several Romance languages. 

=== Loss of any sound ===
* Old English {{wikt-lang|ang|hlāfweard}} &gt; {{wikt-lang|ang|hlāford}} &gt; Middle English {{lang|enm|loverd}} &gt; Modern English ''lord'', pronounced {{IPAc-en|l|ɔːr|d}}
* English ''Worcester'', pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ʊ|s|t|ər}}
* English ''Gloucester'', pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|l|ɒ|s|t|ər}}
* English ''Leicester'', pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɛ|s|t|ər}}
* English ''Towcester'', pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|oʊ|s|t|ər}}

=== Loss of unstressed vowel ===
* Latin {{wikt-lang|la|calidum|cálidum}} &gt; Italian {{wikt-lang|it|caldo}} {{IPA-it|ˈkaldo|}} "hot"
* Latin {{wikt-lang|la|oculum|óculum}} &gt; Italian {{wikt-lang|it|occhio}} {{IPA-it|ˈɔkkjo|}} "eye"
* Latin {{wikt-lang|la|tremulare|tremuláre}} &gt; Italian {{wikt-lang|it|tremare}} {{IPA-it|treˈmaːre|}} "to tremble"
* Proto-Norse {{lang|gmq|armaʀ}} &gt; Old Norse {{lang|non|armr}} "arm"
* Proto-Norse {{lang|gmq|bókiʀ}} &gt; Old Norse {{lang|non|bǿkr}} "books"
* Proto-Germanic ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|himinōz}}'' &gt; Old Norse {{lang|non|himnar}} "heavens"

A syncope rule has been identified in [[Tonkawa language|Tonkawa]], an extinct American Indian language in which the second vowel of a word was deleted unless it was adjacent to a consonant cluster or a final consonant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introductory Phonology |first=Bruce |last=Hayes |authorlink=John C.

'''''The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] covering the field of [[Pagan studies]] including historical, sociological, and anthropological studies dealing with [[Paganism (contemporary)|contemporary Paganism]] and other forms of [[paganism|pagan]] religion. Since 2004 the journal has been published by [[Equinox Publishing (London)|Equinox Publishing]] and the [[editor-in-chief]] is [[Chas S. Clifton]] ([[Colorado State University–Pueblo]]).

The journal was established as a scholarly but not fully peer-reviewed publication in 1996 by [[Fritz Muntean]] and [[Diana Tracy]] with the subtitle ''A New Journal of Neopagan Thought''. In 2001 the production of the journal was put on hiatus, as Muntean stepped down as editor, to be replaced by Clifton when it resumed publication, this time as a fully peer-reviewed academic publication and with its current subtitle.

== History ==
[[File:Pomegranate New Journal.jpg|150px|left|thumb|The front cover to ''The Pomegranate: A New Journal of Neopagan Studies'' (issue 17 portrayed).]]
The idea for ''The Pomegranate'' was initially developed by Fritz Muntean, a graduate student in [[religious studies]] at the [[University of British Columbia]] in Canada, who started the venture with his friend Diana Tracy, who was then living in Oregon in the United States.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 5"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially naming their work ''The Pomegranate: A New Journal of Neopagan Thought'', the stated intention of the publication was to "provide a scholarly venue for the forthright and critical examination of Neopagan beliefs and practices".&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 5"/&gt; From 1996 to 2001, Muntean published 18 issues of ''The Pomegranate'' on a quarterly basis, gaining a growing readership as time went on, particularly after Muntean and Tracy introduced the journal to the assembled members at the third Nature Religions Scholars Network (NRSN), a group which met in conjunction with the annual San Francisco meeting of the [[American Academy of Religion]].&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 5"/&gt;

Muntean eventually decided to move on from his work as editor of ''The Pomegranate'', leaving that position to be occupied by Clifton. Together, Muntean and Clifton searched for a new publisher, in 2003 eventually signing an agreement with Equinox Publishing.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 5"/&gt; Under Clifton's control, the journal's subtitle was changed to ''The International Journal of Pagan Studies'' and it adopted a peer review structure for the papers which it published.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 6"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abstracting and indexing ==
The journal is abstracted and indexed in [[Religious and Theological Abstracts]], [[Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index]], [[Current Contents]]/Arts &amp; Humanities, and [[Academic Search Premier]] and other [[EBSCO Industries|EBSCO databases]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4746">The '''Select Committee on Woman Suffrage''' was a [[Select or special committee (United States)|select committee]] of the [[United States Senate]] from 1882-1921&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert C. Byrd]]. The Senate, 1789-1989, Volume 4: Historical Statistics, 1789-1992. Page 609. [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]]. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; It was established to consider an [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amendment to the United States Constitution]] granting [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women the right to vote in the United States]].

==History==
The Senate established the select committee on January 9, 1882, when it approved a resolution offered by Senator [[George Hoar]] of [[Massachusetts]]. The committee was directed to consider "all petitions, bills, and resolves asking for the extension of suffrage to women or the removal of their legal disabilities." The first [[constitutional amendment]] granting woman suffrage was proposed January 10, 1878, by Senator [[Aaron Augustus Sargent|Aaron Sargent]] of [[California]]. Similar amendments were introduced and referred to the select committee each successive Congress until 1919, when a resolution that was to become the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] passed both houses of [[United States Congress|Congress]].&lt;ref name=sba&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/anthony/timeline.html |title=The Susan B.

The committee became a [[standing committee]] in 1909 when Senator [[Nelson Aldrich]] of [[Rhode Island]] submitted a resolution that had the effect of giving all current select committees, including Woman Suffrage, full committee status. The committee was abolished in 1921, along with many other obsolete committees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/legislative/guide/senate/chapter-13-woman-suffrage.html Center for Legislative Archives - Guide to Senate Records: Chapter 13 Woman Suffrage], [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Woman suffrage leader [[Susan B. Anthony]] testified before the select committee several times over the year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/mar08.html Today in History: March 8, 1884]. [[Library of Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt; the last occurring in 1902.&lt;ref name=sba/&gt;

Upper Peninsula English is considered a subset of [[North-Central American English|North Central (or Upper Midwestern) English]], an American regional dialect, or set of dialects, in transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jenkins |first=Richard |date=May 21, 2015 |url=http://www.yourdailyglobe.com/story/2015/05/21/news/linguistics-professor-provides-insight-into-yooper-accent-trends/4842.html |title=Linguistics Professor Provides Insight into 'Yooper' Accent Trends |work=The Daily Globe |location=Ironwood, MI |access-date=November 13, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015641/http://www.yourdailyglobe.com/story/2015/05/21/news/linguistics-professor-provides-insight-into-yooper-accent-trends/4842.html |archivedate=November 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although spoken throughout the U.P., it is primarily spoken in the western U.P.,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} and not all residents use these features. Many of these features are found throughout the Upper Midwest, especially in northern [[Wisconsin]] and northern [[Minnesota]] and to a degree in the northern [[lower peninsula of Michigan]].

Yooper differs from standard English primarily because of the linguistic background of settlers to the area. The majority of people living in the Upper Peninsula are of [[Finnish Americans|Finnish]], French Canadian, Cornish, [[Scandinavian languages|Scandinavian]], [[German Americans|German]], or Native American descent. The Yooper dialect is also influenced by the [[Finnish language]] making it similar in character to the so-called "Rayncher speek" (presumably an [[eye dialect]] spelling of "Ranger speak"){{clarify|date=July 2015}} spoken in the [[Mesabi Iron Range]] in northeast Minnesota. Almost half the Finnish immigrants to the U.S. settled in the Upper Peninsula, some joining Scandinavians who moved on to Minnesota.

==Phonology and phonetics==
[[File:Census-2000-Data-Top-US-Ancestries-by-County.jpg|thumb|300px|Ethnic makeup of the [[United States Census, 2000|US in 2000]]; the western part of Upper Peninsula is the only region in the U.S. where [[Finnish American]]s (light green) form the plurality.]]
The Yooper accent follows the local [[North Central American English|North Central (Upper Midwest)]] pronunciation system, but with the following noticeable additions:
*Tendency towards intonation that stresses the first syllable of each word, which is an influence of Finnish spoken by many immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
*{{IPA|/w/}} sometimes becomes {{IPA|/v/}}, for example, {{IPA|/ˈkiːvənɔː/}} for [[Keweenaw Peninsula|Keweenaw]]. This is an example of language transfer, where immigrant languages have affected the variety of English spoken in the area. This feature is especially found among residents born before 1950 and in the western region of the U.P.
*Replacement of dental [[fricatives]], {{IPA|/ð/}} and {{IPA|/θ/}}, like in "this" and "thigh," with alveolar stops {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/t/}}, so ''then'' ({{IPA|/ðɛn/}}) becomes ''den'' ({{IPA|/dɛn/}}), etc.
*The word "about" is sometimes pronounced as (a-boat) with a soft a.
*Replacing the "-ing" at the end of certain words with "-een" (doing becomes "do-een", happening becomes "happen-een", something becomes "some-theen"), or with the Cornish characteristic of just "-n" and ins "cook'n" or "walk'n".

==Lexicon and grammar==
{{unreferenced|section|date=October 2015}}
*Use of German/Scandinavian "ja" {{IPA|[jä]}} as "yeah" or "yes," often spelled "ya."
*Ending of sentences in "[[Eh]]." Used at end of sentences with the expectation of receiving an affirmative response or as another word for "huh." ("So, you're {{IPA|/jɚ/}} goin' out t'nide, eh?"), or to add emphasis to a statement, "That's a pretty dress, eh." "Eh" is often associated with [[Canadian English]]. "Heh" ("hey") is used interchangeably and perhaps more often among younger speakers.
*Common Finnish words are often used in conversation even if the communicants are not of Finnish descent.  For instance, "Mitä," when responding, "What?" "Maitoa" (milk), "kahvia" (coffee), "leipää" (bread), "poika" (boy), "tyttö" (girl), "hyvää päivä" (good day), "hyvästit" (good-bye), "isä" (father), "äiti" (mother).
*"Towards" is favored over "toward". The former is usually favored in [[British English]] while the latter is favored in [[American English]].
*Words such as "pank" (to make compact, pat down), "chuk" or "chook" (a knit winter cap, from Canadian French "[[tuque]]" {{IPA|[tsʏk]}}), "choppers" (long-sleeved mittens, sometimes with removable finger flaps, often made of deerskin), "swampers" (boots with rubber bottoms and leather uppers), "[[pasty]]" (pronounced with a soft a), "bakery" (baked goods), "make wood" (cut or chop wood), "snow scoop" or "yooper scooper" (a metal implement for "moving snow"), "wah" (instead of wow) and altered pronunciations such as "grodge" (garage), "crick" (creek); "root" and "roof" may use the same vowel (/ʊ/ IPA) as "soot" and "hoof" respectively.
*Saying "I'm gonna go by your house" to mean "I'm going to come by your house." 
*In some cases, deletion of "to the" has been observed, e.g., "I'm going store," "We went mall," and "We go [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]]." This is an influence from Finnish, which doesn't have the articles "a," "an," or "the", and the preposition "to" is replaced by the [[illative case|illative]] and [[allative case]]s, which, being absent from English, are simply deleted (cf. Finnish ''Menemme Green Bayhin'').
*The use of "come" rather than "came" when referring to a past event, eg. "It come undone" or "It come clean."
*The use of the word "youse" (pronounced the same as the word "use") in a style very similar to the use of "y'all" in the southern USA, both being defined by Merriam-Webster as being pronouns used in addressing two or more persons. In daily usage however "youse" is used almost interchangeably with "you"; where a Southerner would ask "Are y'all going to the game?", a Yooper would typically ask "Are youse guys going to the game"?
