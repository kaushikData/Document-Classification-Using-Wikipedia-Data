      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3930">'''6Q0B44E''', sometimes abbreviated to '''B44E''', is a small object, probably an item of [[space debris]], that is currently orbiting [[Earth]] outside the orbit of the [[Moon]] as of October 2016.

==Discovery==
6Q0B44E was first observed by [[Catalina Sky Survey]] researchers at the [[Lunar and Planetary Laboratory]] of the [[University of Arizona]] on 28 August 2006.&lt;!-- Yahoo Groups not considered reliable sources, please find another cite for this &lt;ref name="Discovery"&gt;Richard A. Kowalski, [http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/mpml/message/17704 Discovery of 6Q0B44E], 30 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; The sighting was confirmed the next day by observations at the [[Siding Spring Survey]] and [[Table Mountain Observatory]].&lt;ref name="Observations"&gt;Distant Artificial-Satellites Observers Circulars, [http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~gwilliams/DASO/000000/DASO_000063.txt DASO Circular No. 63], 29 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
The object is just a few metres across and has been provisionally classified as artificial. 6Q0B44E orbits Earth between 585,000 and 983,000&amp;nbsp;km, which is 2 to 3 times the distance of the Moon's orbit, over a period of 80 days.&lt;ref name="Spacewatch"&gt;[[The Guardian]], Spacewatch, 6 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Its density has been estimated as around 15 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, too low for natural rock and comparable to that expected for an empty fuel tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1106.0564|bibcode=2012NewA...17..446M|doi=10.1016/j.newast.2011.11.008|title=Detection of radiation pressure acting on 2009 BD|journal=New Astronomy|volume=17|issue=4|pages=446|year=2012|last1=Micheli|first1=Marco|last2=Tholen|first2=David J.|last3=Elliott|first3=Garrett T.|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1384107611001709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

6Q0B44E was spotted at what is believed to be the brightest part of its orbit, at 19th [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]]. As the object moves away from Earth, its brightness falls on a six-month cycle down to 28th magnitude, severely limiting study of its composition.&lt;ref name="Ephemerides "&gt;Bill Gray, [http://home.gwi.net/~pluto/mpecs/6q0b44e.htm Pseudo-MPEC for 6Q0B44E] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927183923/http://home.gwi.net/~pluto/mpecs/6q0b44e.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}, 3 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ephemerides]] calculated from the observations suggest that 6Q0B44E probably entered the Earth–Moon system between 2001 and 2003, although it may have arrived up to a decade earlier. Similarities between the discoveries of 6Q0B44E and [[J002E3]], now believed to be part of the [[Apollo 12]] rocket, have led some astronomers to speculate that 6Q0B44E may be another relic of human space exploration which has returned to Earth orbit. However, no space mission has been identified as the source of 6Q0B44E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Azriel|first=Merryl|title=Rocket or Rock? NEO Confusion Abounds|url=http://www.spacesafetymagazine.com/2013/09/25/rocket-or-rock/|publisher=Space Safety Magazine|accessdate=8 December 2013|date=25 September 2013|quote=6Q0B44E was first thought to be a meteor when it was spotted in 2006; it’s now considered artificial but its originating spacecraft is not known.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aerotoxic Association''' was founded on 18 June 2007, at the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[British Parliament|Houses of Parliament]] by former BAe 146 Training Captain John Hoyte,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/health/ex_pilot_from_norwich_claims_aircraft_fumes_ended_his_career_1_3615901|title=Ex-pilot from Norwich claims aircraft fumes ended his career|author=Adam Gretton|website=Edp24.co.uk|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to raise public awareness about the ill health allegedly caused after exposure to airliner cabin air that he claimed been contaminated to toxic levels, by engine oil leaking into the [[bleed air]] system, which pressurizes all [[jet aircraft]], with the exception of the Boeing 787{{cn|date=December 2017}}.

In addition to providing help and support to aircrew and passengers, the Aerotoxic Association promotes known technical solutions, such as toxic air detectors, and campaigns for changes in regulations to improve the quality of cabin air on airliners.

The phrase "[[aerotoxic syndrome]]" was first coined by [[Chris Winder]] and [[Jean-Christophe Balouet]] in 2000, to describe the ill health allegedly caused by exposure to air which they claimed had been contaminated by jet engine oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://aerotoxic.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/icoh_2000_paper5-1.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052804/http://www.aerotoxic.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/icoh_2000_paper5-1.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{As of|2013}} this syndrome is not recognized in [[medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Hale MA, Al-Seffar JA |title=Preliminary report on aerotoxic syndrome (AS) and the need for diagnostic neurophysiological tests |journal=Am J Electroneurodiagnostic Technol |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=260–79 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19891417 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bagshaw, Michael"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asma.org/asma/media/asma/Travel-Publications/Cabin-Air-Quality-A-review-of-current-aviation-medical-understanding-Jul13.pdf|title=Cabin Air Quality: A review of current aviation medical understanding|author =Bagshaw, Michael|publisher=Aerospace Medical Association| date=July 2013|accessdate=2014-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In contrast to the claims of the Aerotoxic Association "Studies such as the European CabinAir project have shown that normally the levels of chemical and biological contaminants in aircraft are less than in many work environments such as office buildings."{{cn|date=December 2017}}

That report examined all exposures dating back to 1943 which showed that all documented exposures were to high concentrations, greatly in excess of the amount present in jet engine oil. He also noted that studies in Canada and the USA were unable to detect [[Tricresyl phosphate|TCP]] in the cabin during flight. Prof Bagshaw notes that the symptoms are "largely the same as those reported by participants in all phase I drug trials", and are similar to the symptoms experienced by patients suffering from [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[gulf war syndrome]], [[Lyme disease]], chronic [[Stress (biological)|stress]] and chronic [[hyperventilation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esam.aero/main/docs/ecam08/No%207%20Bagshaw%20paper.pdf Bagshaw Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227182208/http://www.esam.aero/main/docs/ecam08/No%207%20Bagshaw%20paper.pdf |date=2012-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"A syndrome is a symptom complex, consistent and common to a given condition. Sufferers of the ‘aerotoxic syndrome’ describe a wide range of inconsistent symptoms and signs with much individual variability. The evidence was independently reviewed by the [[Aerospace Medical Association]], the US [[National Academy of Sciences]] and the Australian [[Civil Aviation Safety Authority]] Expert Panel. All concluded there is insufficient consistency to establish a medical syndrome and the ‘aerotoxic syndrome’ is not recognised in aviation medicine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asma.org/asma/media/asma/Travel-Publications/Cabin-Air-Quality-A-review-of-current-aviation-medical-understanding-Jul13.pdf|title=Cabin Air Quality: A review of current aviation medical understanding|author =Bagshaw, Michael |date=July 2013|website=Asma.org|accessdate=2014-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anne Pratt'''  (5 December 1806 – 1893) was a botanical and ornithological illustrator and author from [[Strood]], Kent. The second of three daughters of Robert Pratt (1777–1819), a grocer, and Sara Bundock (1780–1845), Pratt was one of the best known English botanical illustrators of the Victorian age.&lt;ref name=kramer/&gt; Owing to poor health and a 'stiff knee' in childhood, she missed out on 'outdoor activities' and was encouraged to occupy herself by drawing. Anne Pratt was educated at Eastgate House, [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]], and introduced to botany by Dr. Dods, a family friend.&lt;ref name=kramer/&gt; She moved to Brixton, London, in 1826, where she developed her career as an illustrator. She settled in [[Dover]] in 1849, then in [[East Grinstead]] in 1866, where she married John Pearless; they then moved to [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]]. Anne Pratt died in [[Shepherd's Bush]], London.

Anne Pratt wrote more than 20 books, which she illustrated with [[chromolithograph]]s on which she collaborated with [[William Dickes]], an engraver skilled in the chromolithograph process. Her works were written in popular style but were said to be accurate, and are partly responsible for the popularising of botany in her day. From her first book, ''Flowers and Their Associations'', her work sold well, but she never achieved critical acclaim, owing to prejudice against her on the grounds that she was self-taught.&lt;ref name=acclaim/&gt; Her masterpiece is probably ''The Flowering Plants, Grasses, Sedges, and Ferns of Great Britain and Their Allies the Club Mosses, Pepperworts, and Horsetails'', a six-volume project covering more than 1500 species, with 300 illustrations, that took over a decade to publish in full (1855–1873). This work had a remarkably long life as a standard reference work: the illustrations of ferns in the final volume continued to be used into the second half of the twentieth century, appearing, unattributed and in very much reduced in size and in half tone, in the ''Observer's Book of [British] Ferns'' &lt;ref&gt; ''The Observer's Book of Ferns''
compiled by W.J. Stockoe, published by Frederick Warne, no date; ''The Observer's Book of British Ferns'' compiled by W.J. Stockoe, published by Frederick Warne, 1950. &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman ordered the establishment of an atomic research institute in 27 January 1973. Most of the research centres and educational institutions of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission were in West Pakistan. After the Bangladesh Liberation war, Bangladesh only possessed were [[Atomic Energy Centre in Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh Institute of Nuclear Agriculture]] and three nuclear medical centres.&lt;ref name="arc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Forty one years of Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/forty-one-years-of-bangladesh-atomic-energy-commission-13460|accessdate=15 December 2017|work=The Daily Star|date=1 March 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atomic Energy Research Establishment was established in 1975 at Ganakbari, [[Savar Upazila]], [[Dhaka District]]. It was placed under the administration of Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission, which had been facing manpower shortages since the Independence of Bangladesh in 1971.&lt;ref name="aere"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1986 a 3 MWth TRIGA Mark-II research reactor was added to the establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=State of nuclear safety education and research in Bangladesh|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/supplements/rooppur-nuclear-power-programme/state-nuclear-safety-education-and-research-bangladesh|accessdate=15 December 2017|work=The Daily Star|date=16 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institution campus also has an AERE clinic, a Central Administration Division building, and a Central Finance and Accounts Division building. In 1999 the plan was placed to build Energy Unit, Central Engineering Workshop, and Central Library to add to the establishment.&lt;ref name="aere"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutions===
There are 12 independent institutions in its Savar campus that research nuclear related fields&lt;ref name="aere"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Terraces (Bahá'í)}} 
The Terraces of the Bahá'í Faith, also known as the Hanging Gardens of Haifa, are [[Terrace garden|garden terraces]] around the [[Shrine of the Báb]] on [[Mount Carmel, Israel|Mount Carmel]] in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]]. They are one of the most popular destinations for visitors to Israel. The architect is [[Fariborz Sahba]] from [[Iran]], the structural engineers are Karban and Co. from Haifa.

Fariborz Sahba began work in 1987 designing the gardens and oversaw construction. The terraces were opened to the public in June 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Momen |first= Moojan |encyclopedia= Bahá’í Encyclopedia Project |title= Bahá'í World Center |year= 2009 |publisher= National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States |location= Evanston, IL |url= http://www.bahai-encyclopedia-project.org/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=36%3Aadministrationinstitutions&amp;id=74%3Abahai-world-center-&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning at its base, the gardens extend almost a kilometre up the side of Mount Carmel, covering some 200,000 square metres of land. The gardens are linked by a set of stairs flanked by twin streams of running water cascading down the mountainside through the steps and terrace bridges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recreatingeden.com/index.php?pid=8&amp;season=03&amp;episode=30 Gardens of Worship: Recreating Eden (season 3, episode 30, 2006)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301221838/http://www.recreatingeden.com/index.php?pid=8&amp;season=03&amp;episode=30 |date=2012-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gardens have elements of the [[Persian gardens]] of [[Shiraz]], [[Iran]], the [[Nishat Bagh]] gardens of [[Jammu and Kashmir|Kashmir]], [[India]] and [[English gardens]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ganbahai.org.il/en/learn-more/design-management/carmel-design Design Features of the Terraced Gardens on Mount Carmel]&lt;/ref&gt; isolating the site from the noise of the surroundings and connecting the different Bahá'í buildings on Mount Carmel together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ganbahai.org.il/en/learn-more/design-management/ Yael Hammerman: Distinctive Design of the Bahá’í Gardens]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arc and Monument Gardens===
The [[Monument Gardens (Bahá'í World Centre)|Monument Gardens]], set within the [[Arc (Bahá'í)|Arc gardens]] at the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] on Mount Carmel, are a set of gardens which hold the graves of some of the members of the Bahá'í holy family.

[[File:Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh.jpg|thumb|left|Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh with tree-filled indoor garden]]
The Mansion of Bahjí (Arabic: ''delight'') is a summer house near [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], Israel, where [[Bahá'u'lláh]], founder of the Bahá'í Faith died in 1892. His [[Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh|shrine]] is located next to this house. The whole area was called ''Al-Bahjá'' (''Place of Delight''). The site has since been beautified with paradise gardens, which are called ''Haram-i-Aqdas'' (the Most Holy Precincts or Sanctuary) and are intersected by a circular path which serves to [[Circumambulation|circumambulate]] the shrine. The Mansion, shrine, and surrounding gardens are among the most sacred spots on earth for Bahá'ís and are [[Bahá'í pilgrimage]] sites.&lt;ref name="PSmith"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=87–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Balyuzi362"&gt;{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|2000|p=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh is composed of a central area that contains a small, tree-filled garden surrounded by paths covered with Persian rugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = National Spiritual Assembly of the United States |date=January 1966 | title = Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh | journal = Bahá'í News | issue = 418 | page = 4 | url = https://bahai.bwc.org/pilgrimage/Intro/visit_2.asp | accessdate = 2006-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aesth"&gt;{{cite web | last = Viswanathan | first = G.

===Garden of Ridván===
[[File:Garden-of-Ridvan.jpg|thumb|right|Garden of Ridván, Akká]]
{{main|Garden of Ridván, Akka}}
The Garden of Ridván (lit. garden of paradise) is a Bahá'í holy place situated just outside Acre. Originally known as the 'garden of Na‘mayn', it was rented by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] (Bahá'u'lláh's son) for Bahá'u'lláh where he enjoyed spending the later part of his life, after years in a desolate prison cell. Although it shares the same name it does not have the same significance of the Garden of Ridván in Baghdad and no connection to the festival of [[Ridván]].

During the 1930s and 1940s the island setting of the garden disappeared, as a result of a draining project against malaria. In 2010 a three year restoration and conservation project of the garden and the original water canals surrounding it was completed, after which the Ridvan Garden, referred to by Bahá'u'lláh as 'Our Verdant Isle', became an island once again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bahai.org/story/797 BWNS: Holy place restoration sheds light on region's heritage] 29 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is notable as the location where Bahá'u'lláh stayed for twelve days from April 21 to May 2, 1863, after the [[Ottoman Empire]] exiled him from Baghdad and before commencing his journey to [[Constantinople]].  During his stay in this garden, Bahá'u'lláh announced to his followers that he was the messianic figure whose coming had been foretold by the [[Báb]]. These events are celebrated annually during the [[Ridván|Festival of Ridván]].&lt;ref name="walbridge" /&gt;

==At Bahá’í Houses of Worship==
{{main|Bahá'í House of Worship}}
Bahá'í House of Worship, sometimes referred to by its Arabic name of Ma&lt;u&gt;sh&lt;/u&gt;riqu'l-A&lt;u&gt;dh&lt;/u&gt;kár ("Dawning-place of the remembrance of God"),&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter| authorlink= Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Mashriqu'l-Adhkhár |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |page= 235}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the designation of a place of worship, or temple, of the Bahá'í Faith. All Bahá'í temples are surrounded by gardens.

'''Bromodifluoromethane''' or '''Halon 1201''' or '''FC-22B1''' is a [[gaseous]] [[trihalomethane]] or a hydrobromofluorocarbon.

==Synthesis==
It can be prepared be reaction of [[hydrogen]] and [[dibromodifluoromethane]] at temperature in range 400–600&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?wo=1991009000 Method for the production of bromodifluoromethane]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[critical point (thermodynamics)|Critical point]] data: T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 138.83&amp;nbsp;°C (411.98 K); p&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.2 MPa (51.32 bar); V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.275 dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Applications==
Bromodifluoromethane was used as a [[refrigerant]] and in [[fire extinguishers]]. It is a class I [[ozone depleting substance]] with [[ozone depletion potential]] ODP = 0.74. It was banned by [[Montreal Protocol]] in 1996.

'''Brothers of the Wind''' is a 2015 Austrian [[coming of age]]-[[drama film]] directed by [[Gerardo Olivares]] and [[Otmar Penker]] and starring [[Jean Reno]], Manuel Camacho and [[Tobias Moretti]].

== Plot ==
In the 1960s, in an undetermined place in the [[Alps]], an eagle couple has two hatching [[egg]]s. When both [[eagle]]ts are born, their mother knows that she must only raise one as their successor. In an ensuing fight with another eagle, the eaglets' father dies when he crashes to the ground. One of the eaglets shortly falls from the nest, and his mother, due by nature to maintain the survivor, ignores the eaglet's cry for help.

In the meantime, forester Danzer (Jean Reno) meets with a boy named Lukas (Manuel Camacho) and his father Keller (Tobias Moretti). They both live in a new house in the mountains, after the death of Maria (Eva Kuen), mother of Lukas and Keller's wife, as a result of a fire. Keller, gravely afflicted by the death of his wife, fails to live in harmony and understanding with his son, who takes refuge more and more in nature, avoiding contact with his father. As a retreat Lukas constantly goes to the remains of his old house, where he often sees the photograph of his deceased mother.

As Lukas' [[Vizsla|dog]] Scout is taking a walk in the forrest, Lukas comes across the eaglet, and Lukas decides to raise him to full health. Lukas takes the eaglet to his old house to take care of him. Danzer also meets the eaglet, and decides to help Lukas for the affection he feels for him.

The forester tells Lukas that the food he has given the eaglet is not good. He also tells him to give [[sunlight]] to the eaglet. When a [[fox]] sneaks in and kills Keller's hens, he angrily chases Lukas. Lukas, fearful for the safety of the eaglet, goes to his family's hut. Lukas rescues the eaglet from the attacking foxes. As Lukas stays and reads his family's [[Bible]], he comes across the story of [[Cain and Abel]]. Aptly fitting the eaglet's own story, Lukas names it Abel.

As Lukas takes care of Abel, Danzer arrives and invites Lukas to go live with him during the summer and also allows Abel to come with them. He gives Lukas a restrain to be able to catch Abel. When Lukas and Abel arrive, Lukas sees a portrait of a young boy and an eagle. Lukas catches a fish with his own hands for Abel, but Abel lets it slip away. In the meantime, Abel's mother hunts foxes and [[weasel]]s for both her and her son.

As both Abel and his brother grow their new pair of wings, Lukas tries to help Abel fly. Eventually Abel starts to soar in the air. Lukas decides to spend that night in his old house. Next day, however, Abel is missing. Lukas then sees Abel fly around. Abel perches on top of a rock, but as Lukas tries to reach Abel, Abel flies away, making Lukas sad. Danzer tries to comfort Lukas by saying Abel only wants to experience the wild, but confesses he doesn't really know what will be of Abel.

Abel tries to hunt a [[chamois]] but fails. As Lukas ponders about Abel's whereabouts, he realizes the two dangers Abel will face; his father's shotgun, and Abel's own brother, whom Lukas has symbolically named Cain. After three days, Abel finally returns to Lukas. Danzer offers to help Lukas how to teach Abel to hunt. Keller, however, complains of Danzer's methods, and warns him. Regardless, they still train Abel with a makeshift method.

Lukas and Danzer get scared when they think Abel is trying to hunt Scout, but later they see Abel simply hunted a weasel. Danzer, nevertheless, tells Lukas that Abel will have to leave someday, and Lukas sadly agrees. As Lukas and Danzer take a blindfolded Abel to an unknown part of the mountains, Lukas bids a farewell to Abel. After taking the [[blindfold]], they let Abel fly.

In winter, Abel learns to hunt and feed himself. Lukas, remembering his animal friend, later finds a small memorial that he made with a pile of rocks and one of Abel's feathers. As he awakens from sleeping, Lukas sees a [[Eurasian wolf|wolf]] nearby. As Lukas runs away, he accidentally steps on a [[Trapping|bear trap]]. Danzer, who happens to be nearby, scares the wolf away with his rifle and helps Lukas heal. Unfortunately, the rift between Lukas and Keller grows wider.

Danzer tells the story of the ''Brothers of the Wind'' to Lukas. Lukas wonders how the story ends. Danzer believes that even after knowing the last page they would still not know the outcome.

Lukas decides to leave Keller. Unfortunately, as he leaves, Keller finds him, and asks Lukas to light a match for him. When Keller lights the match, Lukas believes that Keller killed his mother by arson. As Lukas escapes into the mountains, Keller goes afer him. Lukas searches for Abel, but a [[rock slide]] started by a fox stops Lukas from climbing the mountain. A [[lightning strike]]s nearby, knocking Lukas unconscious. Abel soars over him, and Keller wakes him up, stating he is sorry for his ill treatment. An eagle appears to be killed by the rock slide.

Two years later, Lukas and Keller walk by. Lukas says he feels Abel still lives, but Keller tells him he was the dead eagle of the rock slide. Keller then tells Lukas to stretch his arm. Flying above, Abel appears and perches on Lukas' arm. Lukas, deciding it is time to let Abel go for good, takes off a bracelet he put on Abel's foot long time ago. As Danzer watches from the distance, Abel soars into the sky. Finally, Abel and a female eagle await the arrival of a new hatch, thus continuing the circle of life.

The [[Calgary]] Downtown District Energy Centre is a thermal district energy system under development by [[Calgary]]-based [[ENMAX]] with funding support from provincial and federal government programs. The first central thermal plant to supply the system is under construction at the corner of 4th Street and 9th Avenue SE in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. Although the groundbreaking ceremony for the project took place in early fall of 2008, major construction activities did not commence until late November. The first phase of the system is expected to be operational in 2009, supplying thermal energy to meet the space and domestic hot water heating needs of selected new and existing buildings in Calgary's downtown.

The Centre will be owned by a subsidiary of [[ENMAX]], which will develop and operate the facility and its related thermal distribution system.

[[Image:Corrientes-oceanicas.png|300px|thumb|The ocean currents.  California Current in blue.]]
[[File:Corriente de California-Feb-13-2013-20.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|The lack of clouds along the coast (and also along the Central Valley of California) is due to an offshore wind blowing drier air from the land offshore.]]

The '''California Current''' is a [[Pacific Ocean]] [[ocean current|current]] that moves southward along the western coast of [[North America]], beginning off southern [[British Columbia]] and ending off southern [[Baja California Peninsula]]. It is considered an [[Eastern boundary current]] due to the influence of the North American coastline on its course. It is also one of five major coastal currents affiliated with strong [[upwelling]] zones, the others being the [[Humboldt Current]], the [[Canary Current]], the [[Benguela Current]], and the [[Somali Current]]. The California Current is part of the [[North Pacific Gyre]], a large swirling current that occupies the northern basin of the Pacific.

==Physical properties==
The movement of Alaskan and northern ocean currents southward down the west coast results in much cooler ocean temperatures than at comparable [[latitude]]s on the east coast of the United States, where ocean currents come from the Caribbean and tropical Atlantic. The cooler ocean current along the west coast also makes summer temperatures cooler on the west coast compared to the east coast. For example, [[Half Moon Bay, California|Half Moon Bay]] at 37 degrees latitude has no month with an average high above {{convert|67|F|C}} and [[San Francisco]] often stays below {{convert|70|F|C}} in summer, while Virginia Beach, VA close to the same latitude has six months when high temperatures are above {{convert|70|F|C}}.

Additionally, extensive [[upwelling]] of colder sub-surface waters occurs, caused by the prevailing northwesterly winds acting through the [[Ekman Effect]]. The winds drive surface water to the right of the wind flow, that is offshore, which draws water up from below to replace it. The upwelling further cools the already cool California Current. This is the mechanism that produces California's characteristic coastal [[fog]] and cool ocean waters. As a result, ocean surf temperatures are much colder along the Pacific coast than the Atlantic coast. For example, the average July SST (sea surface temperature) at [[New York City]] at 40.7 degrees latitude is {{convert|73|F|C}}, while at the same latitude in [[Eureka, CA]] is {{convert|57|F|C}}. As such, ocean surf temperatures are rarely above {{convert|66|F|C}} during the summer along the California coast south to San Diego, while they are often above {{convert|80|F|C}} on the east coast from North Carolina southward.&lt;ref name=Mann&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=K.H.|last2=Lazier|first2=J.R.N. |date=2006 |title=Dynamics of Marine Ecosystems:  Biological-Physical Interactions in the Oceans| edition=3rd|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/9781118687901 |location= |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |pages=166–167, 194–204 |isbn= 9781405111188|author-link= |doi=10.1002/9781118687901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cold water is highly productive due to the [[upwelling]], which brings to the surface nutrient-rich sediments, supporting large populations of [[whale]]s, [[seabird]]s and important [[fisheries]]. Winds of the appropriate direction and strength to induce upwelling are more prevalent in the presence of Eastern boundary currents, such as the California Current.&lt;ref name=Mann/&gt;  Phytoplankton production is dramatically increased in these areas because the nutrient-rich water lying below the [[pycnocline]] is relatively close to the surface and is thus easily upwelled.&lt;ref name=Mann/&gt; Scientists at [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] said in 2011 that the average surface temperature of the water at Scripps Pier has increased by almost 3 degrees since 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/jun/18/taking-stock-california-current/|title=Is global warming changing California Current?|date=June 18, 2011|work=U-T (San Diego Union Tribune)|author=Lee, Mike|accessdate=June 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Bakun upwelling index" is based on a 20-year average of the monthly mean Ekman transport for different regions off the California coast. It ranges from 300 meters-cubed/second (in the offshore direction) to −212 meters-cubed/second (toward the coast, or onshore direction). There is year-round upwelling off Southern California's coast, but it is strongest in the summer months.  Off the coast of Oregon and Washington, there is forceful downwelling in the winter months, and upwelling in the region is restricted to the months of April through September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bakun |first=Andrew |date=1973 |title=Coastal Upwelling Indices, West Coast of North America, 1946–71 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/?id=zoGIGQAACAAJ |location= |publisher=National Marine Fisheries Service |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological properties ==
Primary production is a topic of interest among those who study the California Current.  In their study, Hayward and Venrick (1982) found great variability in both biomass and the productivity of phytoplankton in the California Current.  The differences observed by Hayward and Venrick in carbon-fixation rates (0.2–2.0&amp;nbsp;grams carbon/(meter-squared × day)) show the heterogeneous nature of the California Current, with its combination of advected (see [[advection]]) and upwelled water.  Several studies have investigated the carbon flow from primary production to the pelagic fish stocks which depend on the California Current.  Lasker (1988) described powerful "jets and squirts" off northern and central California.  These 'jets and squirts' move large quantities of cold, nutrient rich water offshore.  This water then gets carried by the southward bound California Current and adds significant primary production to the sardine population.&lt;ref name=Mann/&gt;

== Related Currents ==
A narrower, weaker counter current, the [[Davidson Current]], occasionally moves somewhat warmer water northwards during the winter months.  During [[El Niño]] events, the California Current is disrupted, leading to declines in [[phytoplankton]], resulting in cascading effects up the food chain, such as declines in fisheries, seabird breeding failures and marine mammal mortality (Schwing et al., 2003). In 2005, a failure in the otherwise predictable upwelling events, unassociated with El Niño, caused a collapse in [[krill]] in the current, leading to similar effects (Schwing et al., 2003).

Within the  [[Southern California Bight]] a sub-region of the California Current has unique physical properties.  Upwelling is fairly weak in the California Bight and Smith and Eppley (1982) stated that the 16-year average for primary production was 0.402&amp;nbsp;grams carbon/(meter-squared × day), or approximately 150&amp;nbsp;grams carbon/(meter-squared × year).  Further, Smith and Eppley (1982) found that the highest daily rates of temperature decrease were correlated with the maximum amount of upwelling.&lt;ref name=Mann/&gt;  Digiacomo and Holt (2001) used satellite images to study the mesoscale and sub-mesoscale eddies in the Southern California Bight.  Their work showed that all [[eddies]] were less than 50&amp;nbsp;km in diameter and 70% of all eddies measured less than 10&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=Mann/&gt;  The eddies appeared to be caused mostly by topography (particularly islands), wind, and instabilities in the current.  The location of these eddies was mainly between the California Current (flowing toward the equator) and the coastline.&lt;ref name=Mann/&gt;  The majority of these eddies were cyclonic and had the ability to induce the upwelling of nutrient-rich water.  Small scale topographic features such as headlands have been shown to cause substantial effects on the population dynamics of benthic invertebrates, such a change in the settlement patterns of crabs and sea urchin.&lt;ref name=Mann/&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the 2016 [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film ''[[Finding Dory]]'', the California Current is portrayed as a superhighway that fish and sea turtles use to travel to [[California]] . The characters Marlin, Nemo, and Dory join a group of sea turtles in using the California Current, by way of the [[East Australian Current]], to help them travel to Morro Bay, California.

Near the summits of [[Mount Olympus]] lies the '''chapel of the Prophet Elias''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]) Εκκλησάκι του Προφίτη Ηλία). The [[Orthodox Church]] celebrates the saint on July 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prophet-elias.de/prelias.html|title=Life of the Prophet Elias (in German)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
The 2803 meter high peak of Profitis Ilias (Προφίτης Ιλίας) is located near the highest peaks of Mount Olympus (Mytikas and Stefani). The closest mountain huts are the Apostolidis Hut (430 meters away)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apostolidisrefuge.gr/en/history.html|title=Apostolidis Refuge}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Christos Kakkalos Hut (around 600 meters away).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.olympus-climbing.gr/index.php?page=refuges&amp;id=4#|title=Christos Kakkalos Refuge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Saint Dionysius, founder of the Monastery of the Holy Trinity (nowadays known as [[Monastery Agios Dionysios]]), also founded the chapel of the Prophet Elias in the 16th century. It was built on the ruins of an ancient structure. Dionysus, who practised an ascetic life, is said to have lived in the church at times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imado.gr/monastery/content/view/56/121/lang,en/l|title=ST. DIONYSIOS OF OLYMPUS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapel is the highest ecclesiastical building of the Orthodox Church worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5862/|title=UNESCO, The broader region of Mount Olympus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The building ==
The chapel was built on the top of Mount Profitis Ilias; the main building materials were the surrounding stones. The floor of the chapel is covered with stone slabs, the outer walls are made of layered stones, without further connecting material. Covered with stone slabs, the roof is supported by a solid wooden construction to support the snow load. An atrium is protected on the eastern and southern sides by a natural stone wall, which has an entrance on the north side. The low entrance to the chapel is on the south side of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date= |title=Profitis Elias Olympos |trans-title= |medium= |language= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4tIhXIOLUU |access-date= |archive-url= |archive-date= |format= |time= |location= |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Inside hang some [[icons]]; a small altar, framed by icons depicting saints of the Orthodox Church, gives believers the opportunity to light a candle.

[[File:NASA graphic representing the distribution of solar radiation.jpg|thumb|NASA graphic representing the distribution of solar radiation]]
'''Cloud albedo''' is a measure of the [[albedo]] of a [[cloud]]. Higher values indicate that a cloud reflects a larger amount of [[solar radiation]] and [[Transmittance|transmits]] a smaller amount of radiation.  Cloud albedo depends on the total mass of water, the size and shape of the droplets or particles and their distribution in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theweatherprediction.com/habyhints3/758/|title=CLOUD ALBEDO EFFECT|website=www.theweatherprediction.com|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Physical Climatology|last=Hartmann|first=Dennis|publisher=ELSEVIER|year=|isbn=978-0-12-328531-7|location=Australia|pages=76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloud albedo, along with the [[greenhouse effect]] of clouds, strongly influence the [[Earth's energy budget]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Clouds/|title=Clouds &amp; Radiation Fact Sheet : Feature Articles|last=Steve|first=Graham,|date=1999-03-01|website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thick clouds (such as [[stratocumulus]]) reflect a large amount of incoming solar radiation, meaning they have a high albedo.  Thin clouds (such as [[Cirrus cloud|Cirrus]]) tend to transmit most solar radiation, so have low albedo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Library/Clouds/|title=EO Library: Clouds &amp; Radiation Fact Sheet|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/cchen/Latham_et_al_2008.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What can change cloud albedo? ==

=== Liquid Water Path (LWP) ===
Studies have shown that cloud liquid water path varies with changing cloud droplet size, which may alter the behavior of clouds and their albedo.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Han|first=Qingyuan|last2=Rossow|first2=William B.|last3=Chou|first3=Joyce|last4=Welch|first4=Ronald M.|date=1998-07-01|title=Global Survey of the Relationships of Cloud Albedo and Liquid Water Path with Droplet Size Using ISCCP|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0442(1998)011%3C1516:GSOTRO%3E2.0.CO;2|journal=Journal of Climate|volume=11|issue=7|pages=1516–1528|doi=10.1175/1520-0442(1998)0112.0.CO;2|issn=0894-8755}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variations of the albedo of typical clouds in the atmosphere are dominated by the column amount of liquid water and ice in the cloud.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cloud albedo varies from less than 10% to more than 90% and depends on drop sizes, liquid [[water]] or ice content, thickness of the cloud, and the [[sun]]'s [[zenith angle]]. The smaller the drops and the greater the liquid water content, the greater the cloud albedo, if all other factors are the same.

=== The Twomey Effect (Aerosol Indirect Effect) ===
Addition of cloud nuclei by pollution can lead to an increase in solar radiation reflected by clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Twomey|first=S.|date=May 1974|title=Pollution and the Planetary Albedo|url=|journal=Pollution and Planetary Albedo|volume=|pages=1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing aerosol concentration and aerosol density increases cloud droplet concentration, decreases cloud droplet size, and increases cloud albedo.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In macrophysically identical clouds, a cloud with few larger drops will have a lower albedo than a cloud with more smaller drops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~robwood/teaching/591/ATMS_591_Twomey_1977.pdf|title=The Twomey Effect|last=Wood|first=Rob|date=|website=atmos.washington.edu|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zenith Angle ===
The cloud albedo increases with the total water content or depth of the cloud and with the [[solar zenith angle]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The variation of albedo with zenith angle is most rapid when the sun is near the horizon, and least when the sun is overhead. Absorption of solar radiation by plane-parallel clouds decreases with increasing zenith angle because radiation that is reflected to space at the higher zenith angles penetrates less deeply into the cloud and is therefore less likely to be absorbed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Cold rubber''', or '''cold polymerized rubber''', is [[synthetic rubber]] (especially, [[Styrene-butadiene|SBR]] and [[Nitrile butadiene rubber|NBR]]) emulsion [[polymerized]] at a relatively low temperature.

The polymerizing temperature is approximately 5℃ in the case of SBR and 5∼10℃ in the case of NBR. 
Since rubber molecule types have a smaller number of branches than hot rubber polymerized at high temperature (50℃) and are characterized by good [[stereoregularity]], cold rubber has superior processability as well as the ability to produce [[vulcanized]] materials with good [[tensile strength]], expansion and aging resistance, and flex resistance.

Except some SBR and NBR used for special purposes, most SBR and NBR available in the market are considered cold rubber.

'''Dibromodifluoromethane''' is a mixed [[halomethane]]. It is a colorless non-flammable liquid.

Along with Halons [[Halon 1211|1211]], [[Dibromotetrafluoroethane|2402]], and [[Halon 1301|1301]], it is the most effective [[fire extinguishers]], however, also the most toxic one.{{clarify|date=October 2011}}

It is a class I [[ozone depleting substance]] (ODS).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6444">In [[atomic physics]], '''Doppler broadening''' is the broadening of [[spectral line]]s due to the [[Doppler effect]] caused by a distribution of velocities of [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s. Different velocities of the [[Spontaneous_emission|emitting]] particles result in different Doppler shifts, the cumulative effect of which is the line broadening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book 
  |title=Lasers
  |author=Siegman, AE
  |year=1986
  |url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=1BZVwUZLTkAC&amp;lpg=PA1184&amp;ots=6xdm1N2jLf&amp;dq=doppler%20broadening%20Siegman&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA1184#v=onepage&amp;q=doppler%20broadening%20Siegman&amp;f=false
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This resulting line profile is known as a '''Doppler profile'''. A particular case is the '''thermal Doppler broadening''' due to the [[Kinetic theory of gases|thermal motion]] of the particles. Then, the broadening depends only on the [[frequency]] of the spectral line, the [[mass]] of the emitting particles, and their [[temperature]], and therefore can be used for inferring the temperature of an emitting body.

[[Saturated absorption spectroscopy]], also known as Doppler-free spectroscopy, can be used to find the true frequency of an atomic transition without cooling a sample down to temperatures at which the Doppler broadening is minimal.

== Derivation ==

When thermal motion causes a particle to move towards the observer, the emitted radiation will be shifted to a higher frequency. Likewise, when the emitter moves away, the frequency will be lowered. For non-relativistic thermal velocities, the [[Doppler effect|Doppler shift]] in frequency will be:

:&lt;math&gt;f = f_0\left(1+\frac{v}{c}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ f&lt;/math&gt; is the observed frequency, &lt;math&gt;\ f_0&lt;/math&gt; is the rest frequency, &lt;math&gt;\ v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the emitter towards the observer, and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]].

Since there is a distribution of speeds both toward and away from the observer in any volume element of the radiating body, the net effect will be to broaden the observed line. If &lt;math&gt;\,P_v(v)dv&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of particles with velocity component &lt;math&gt;\,v&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\,v+dv&lt;/math&gt; along a line of sight, then the corresponding distribution of the frequencies is

:&lt;math&gt;P_f(f)df = P_v(v_f)\frac{dv}{df}df&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\,v_f = c\left(\frac{f}{f_0} - 1\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity towards the observer corresponding to the shift of the rest frequency &lt;math&gt;\,f_0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\,f&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore,

::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff"
|&lt;math&gt;P_f(f)df = \frac{c}{f_0}P_v\left(c\left(\frac{f}{f_0} - 1\right)\right)df&lt;/math&gt;.
|}

We can also express the broadening in terms of the [[wavelength]] &lt;math&gt;\,\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. Recalling that in the non-relativistic limit &lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda-\lambda_{0}}{\lambda_{0}} \approx -\frac{f-f_0}{f_0}&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain

::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff"
|&lt;math&gt;P_\lambda(\lambda)d\lambda = \frac{c}{\lambda_0}P_v\left(c\left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_0}\right)\right)d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.
|}

In the case of the thermal Doppler broadening, the velocity distribution is given by the [[Maxwell distribution]]
:&lt;math&gt;P_v(v)dv = \sqrt{\frac{m}{2\pi kT}}\,\exp\left(-\frac{mv^2}{2kT}\right)dv&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\,m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the emitting particle, &lt;math&gt;\,T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature and &lt;math&gt;\,k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]]. 

Then,

:&lt;math&gt;P_f(f)df=\left(\frac{c}{f_0}\right)\sqrt{\frac{m}{2\pi kT}}\,\exp\left(-\frac{m\left[c\left(\frac{f}{f_0}-1\right)\right]^2}{2kT}\right)df&lt;/math&gt;.

We can simplify this expression as

:&lt;math&gt;P_f(f)df=\sqrt{\frac{mc^2}{2\pi kT {f_0}^2}}\,
\exp\left(-\frac{mc^2\left(f-f_0\right)^2}{2kT {f_0}^2}\right)df&lt;/math&gt;,

which we immediately recognize as a [[Gaussian_function|Gaussian profile]] with the [[standard deviation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{f} = \sqrt{\frac{kT}{mc^2}}f_0&lt;/math&gt;

and [[full width at half maximum]] (FWHM)

::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff"
|&lt;math&gt;\Delta f_{\text{FWHM}} = \sqrt{\frac{8kT\ln 2}{mc^2}}f_{0}&lt;/math&gt;.
|}

== Applications and caveats ==

In [[astronomy]] and [[plasma physics]], the thermal Doppler broadening is one of the explanations for the broadening of spectral lines, and as such gives an indication for the temperature of observed material. Other causes of velocity distributions may exist, though, for example due to [[turbulence|turbulent]] motion. For a fully developed turbulence, the resulting line profile is generally very difficult to distinguish from the thermal one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Hans R. | last = Griem | year = 1997
 | title = Principles of Plasmas Spectroscopy
 | publisher = University Press | location = Cambridge | isbn = 0-521-45504-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another cause could be a large range of ''macroscopic'' velocities resulting, e.g., from the receding and approaching portions of a rapidly spinning [[accretion disk]]. Finally, there are many other factors which can also broaden the lines. For example, a sufficiently high particle [[number density]] may lead to significant [[Stark broadening]].

Doppler broadening can also be used to determine the velocity distribution of a gas given its absorption spectrum. In particular, this has been used to determine the velocity distribution of interstellar gas clouds. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1936MNRAS..96..661B|title = On the interpretation of interstellar lines|last = Beals, C.S.|website = adsabs.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doppler broadening has also been used as a design consideration in high temperature [[nuclear reactors]]. In principle, as the reactor fuel heats up, the neutron absorption spectrum will broaden due to the relative thermal motion of the fuel atoms with respect to the neutrons. Given the shape of the neutron absorption spectrum, this has the result of reducing [[Neutron cross section|neutron absorption cross section]], reducing the likelihood of absorption and fission. The end result is that reactors designed to take advantage of doppler broadening will decrease their reactivity as temperature increases, creating a [[Passive nuclear safety|passive safety measure]]. This tends to be more relevant to [[Gas-cooled reactor|gas cooled reactors]] as other mechanisms are dominant in [[Light water reactor|water cooled reactors]].

The '''dry-bulb temperature''' (DBT) is the [[temperature]] of [[air]] measured by a [[thermometer]] freely exposed to the air, but shielded from [[radiation]] and [[moisture]].  DBT is the temperature that is usually thought of as air temperature, and it is the true [[thermodynamic temperature]]. It indicates the amount of heat in the air and is directly proportional to the mean [[kinetic energy]] of the air molecules. Temperature is usually measured in degrees [[Celsius]] (°C), [[kelvin]]s (K), or degrees [[Fahrenheit]] (°F).

Unlike [[wet bulb temperature]], dry bulb temperature does not indicate the amount of moisture in the air. In [[construction]], it is an important consideration when [[Design|designing]] a [[building]] for a certain [[climate]].  Nall called it one of "the most important climate variables for human comfort and building [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]."&lt;ref&gt;Nall, D. H. (2004-11). Looking across the water: Climate-adaptive buildings in the United States &amp; Europe. In ''The Construction Specifier'', 57, 50 – 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

DBT is an important variable in [[Psychrometrics]], being the horizontal axis of a [[Psychrometrics#Psychrometric charts|Psychrometric chart]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2187">The '''Flandrian interglacial''' or stage is the name given by [[geologist]]s and [[archaeologist]]s in the [[British Isles]] to the first, and so far only, stage of the [[Holocene]] epoch (the present geological period), covering the period from around 12,000 years ago, at the end of the [[last glacial period]]  to the present day. As such, it is in practice identical in span to the Holocene. Present climatological theory (based on analysis of [[Milankovitch cycles]]) forecasts that the present  Flandrian climate should decline in temperature towards a global climate similar to that of the ice age. Less orbital eccentricity may have the effect of moderating this temperature downturn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/297/5585/1287 sciencemag.org An Exceptionally Long Interglacial Ahead?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Flandrian began as the relatively short-lived [[Younger Dryas]] climate downturn came to an end. This formed the last gasp of the [[Devensian glaciation]], the final stage of the [[Pleistocene]] epoch and is traditionally seen as the latest warm [[interglacial]] in a series that has been occurring throughout the [[Quaternary]] [[geological period]]. 

The first part of the Flandrian, known as the Younger Atlantic, was a period of fairly rapid sea level rise,&lt;ref&gt;Tooley, M. J. (1979) ''Sea-level Changes: North-West England During the Flandrian Stage'' Clarendon Press, Oxford, England, {{ISBN|978-0-19-823228-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as the '''Flandrian transgression''' and associated with the melting of the [[Fennoscandia|Fenno-Scandian]], [[Geology of Scotland|Scottish]], [[Laurentide Ice Sheet|Laurentide]] and [[Cordilleran Ice Sheet|Cordilleran]] glaciers.

Fjords were formed during the Flandrian transgression when U-shaped glaciated valleys were inundated with water.&lt;ref&gt;Stoker, Martyn S. (2010) "Late glacial ice-cap dynamics in NW Scotland: evidence from the fjords of the Summer Isles region" ''Quaternary Science Reviews'' 28(27/28):&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;3161&amp;ndash;3184, doi: 10.1016/j.quascirev.2009.09.012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fox-1D''', '''AO-92''' or '''AMSAT OSCAR 92'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amsat.org/fox-1d-launched-designated-amsat-oscar-92|title=FOX-1D (AO-92)|publisher=Ciprian Sufitchi|accessdate=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] [[amateur radio satellite]]. Fox-1D is a 1U [[CubeSat]] developed and built by [[AMSAT|AMSAT-NA]]. Fox-1D carries a single-channel transponder for mode U/V in [[Frequency modulation|FM]]. Fox-1D has an [[L-band]] converter (the AMSAT L-band downshifter experiment), which allows the FM [[transponder]] to be switched on an uplink in the {{convert|23|cm|in}} band.

To enable it to launch under [[NASA]]'s '''ELaNa''' ('''Educational Launch of Nanosatellites''') program, the satellite continues to carry the following scientific and technical payloads:

* High Energy Radiation CubeSat (HERCI);
* Camera Experiment;
* MEMS GYRO Experiment.

The satellite has a rod antenna for the {{convert|70|cm|in}} and {{convert|2|m|ft}} band, as well as an antenna for the {{convert|23|cm|ft}} band.

==Mission==
The satellite was launched on January 12, 2018 at 03:59 UTC with a [[Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle|PSLV XL rocket]], along with the main payloads [[Cartosat-2F]], [[NovaSAR-S]], and 31 other small satellites from the [[Satish Dhawan Space Center]], [[India]]. At 05:17 UTC, the antennas were deployed over the [[North Pole]] and the satellite began to work. At 05:28 UTC the first telemetry was received. Commissioning is scheduled for approximately two weeks. After that Fox-1D should be available for connections between amateur radio stations.

[[Image:Great Australian Bight map.png|thumb|230px|right|Map of Australia, showing the Great Australian Bight.]]
[[Image:Great Australian Bight Marine Park.jpg|230px|thumb|right|Great Australian Bight]]

The '''Great South Australian Coastal Upwelling System''' is a seasonal [[upwelling]] system in the eastern [[Great Australian Bight]], extending from [[Ceduna, South Australia]], to [[Portland, Victoria]], over a distance of about {{convert|800|km|mi}}. Upwelling events occur in the austral summer (from November to May) when seasonal winds blow from the southeast. These winds blow parallel to the shoreline at certain areas of the coast, which forces coastal waters offshore via [[Ekman transport]] and draws up cold, nutrient-rich waters from the ocean floor.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|9–10}}

Because the deep water carries abundant nutrients up from the [[ocean floor]], the upwelling area differs from the rest of the Great Australian Bight, especially the areas offshore of [[Western Australia]] and the [[Nullabor]] in [[South Australia]], which are generally nutrient-poor. Every summer, the upwelling sustains a bountiful ecosystem that attracts [[blue whale]]s and supports rich [[fishery|fisheries]].&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|25}}&lt;ref name="Kampf"/&gt;{{rp|1}}

The Great South Australian Coastal Upwelling System (GSACUS) is [[Australia]]'s only deep-reaching coastal upwelling system, with nutrient-enriched water stemming from depths exceeding {{convert|300|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Preconditioning"&gt;Kämpf, J., 2010. On the preconditioning of coastal upwelling in the eastern Great Australian Bight. Journal of Geophysical Research – Oceans, VOL. 115, C12071, 11 pp., {{doi|10.1029/2010JC006294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, a new upwelling centre has been discovered on the western shelf of Tasmania.&lt;ref name="Tasmania"&gt;Kämpf, J., 2015. Phytoplankton blooms on the western shelf of Tasmania: evidence of a highly productive ecosystem, Ocean Sci., 11, 1-11. {{doi|10.5194/os-11-1-2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this new upwelling centre is located outside South Australian waters, the entire upwelling system should be rather called the '''Great Southern Australian Coastal Upwelling System'''.

==Oceanographic processes==

During the austral summer, [[high-pressure system]]s over the Great Australian Bight cause southeasterly winds to blow over the coasts of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and South Australia. When winds blow parallel to the shoreline, [[Ekman transport]] pushes water to the left of the wind direction (in the southern hemisphere), which in this case is westward and offshore. To replace the water moving offshore, cold waters from the ocean floor rise to the surface.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|9–10}} During upwelling events, local sea surface temperature drops by  2-3 degrees Celsius.&lt;ref name="Kampf"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

Key upwelling centres form in three different locations, described in the sub-sections below; the Kangaroo Island and Eyre Peninsula centres are linked by the same upwelling process.&lt;ref name="Conservation"&gt;Butler, A. J., F. Althaus, D. M. Furlani, and K. R. Ridgway. [http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/mpa/publications/pubs/conservation-assessment-bonney.pdf Assessment of the Conservation Values of the Bonney Upwelling Area: A Component of the Commonwealth Marine Conservation Assessment Program 2002-2004: Report to Environment Australia.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602141311/http://environment.gov.au/coasts/mpa/publications/pubs/conservation-assessment-bonney.pdf |date=2012-06-02 }} Published by CSIRO Marine Research (now [[CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research]]) and Environment Australia, Dec. 2002. Accessed 12 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2;10;25}}&lt;ref name="Kampf"/&gt; Upwelling events occur nearly simultaneously across the three separate centres, appearing within a few days of each other, despite spanning a distance of approximately {{convert|800|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name="Kampf"/&gt;{{rp|1–2}} While the Bonney Upwelling, where the strongest and most reliable upwelling events occur, was reported and explored over 30 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, R.K. 1981. Seasonal upwelling along the south-eastern coastline of South Australia. Australian Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research 32: 843-854.&lt;/ref&gt; the full extent of the upwelling system was discovered only as recently as 2004.&lt;ref name="Kampf"&gt;Kämpf, J., M. Doubell, D. Griffin, R. L. Matthews &amp; T. M. Ward, 2004. Evidence of a large seasonal coastal upwelling system along the Southern Shelf of Australia. Geophysical Research Letters, Vol. 31, L09310, {{doi|10.1029/2003GLO19221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bonney Upwelling===

The Bonney Upwelling is the largest and most predictable upwelling in the GSACUS. It stretches from [[Portland, Victoria]] to [[Robe, South Australia]]. The [[continental shelf]] is narrow offshore of the "Bonney Coast" - only about {{convert|20|km|mi}} from the shore to the [[continental slope]] - and deep water is funneled to the surface through a series of [[submarine canyon]]s.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|4;24–26}}&lt;ref name="Kampf"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

===Kangaroo Island and Eyre Peninsula===

Upwelling at [[Kangaroo Island]] and the [[Eyre Peninsula]] is different than at the Bonney Upwelling. Here, the [[continental shelf]] is generally much wider than at the Bonney Coast - up to {{convert|100|km|mi}} wide off the Eyre Peninsula - and water is not drawn directly from the seafloor to the surface. Instead, field data and hydrodynamic modelling suggest that the upwelling follows from a chain of processes.&lt;ref name="Preconditioning"/&gt; This chain of processes starts in the deep submarine canyons of the Murray Canyon Group, located south of Kangaroo Island, where localized sub-surface upwelling brings a pool of cold water from the [[abyssal plains]] up to the continental shelf. This dense-water pool, named the ''Kangaroo Island Pool'', drifts along the shelf bottom just offshore of Kangaroo Island and the Eyre Peninsula. When a classical wind-driven upwelling event occurs, normally two to three times a summer, cold water is upwelled from the pool, not directly from the [[ocean floor]].&lt;ref name="Kampf"/&gt;{{rp|1–3}}&lt;ref name="Alongshore"&gt;McClatchie, S., J. F. Middleton, and T. M. Ward (2006), Water mass and alongshore variation in upwelling intensity in the eastern Great Australian Bight, J. Geophys. Res., 111, C08007, {{doi|10.1029/2004JC002699}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Der Borch, C.C., J.R. Conolly, R.S. Dietz, Sedimentation and structure of the continental margin in the vicinity of the Otway Basin, southern Australia, Marine Geology, Volume 8, Issue 1, January 1970, Pages 59-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
[[File:Nyctiphanes australis.jpg|thumb|alt=Australian Krill|Large swarms of [[krill]], ''[[Nyctiphanes australis]]'', form during upwelling events.]]
[[File:Blue Whale 001 body bw.jpg|thumb|alt=Blue Whale|An abundance of krill makes the Bonney Upwelling an important feeding site for the [[Blue Whale]] (''Balaenoptera musculus'')]]

Extensive upwelling of nutrient-rich water makes the GSACUS an important marine hot spot on Australia's southern shelves. During upwelling events, the abundance of the GSACUS ecosystem can approach that of some of the world’s most productive upwelling centers, such as those offshore of [[Humboldt Current|Peru]], [[California Current|California]], and [[Benguela Current#Upwelling and primary production|Namibia]].&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;Ward, T. M., McLeay, L. J., Dimmlich, W. F., Rogers, P. J., McClatchie, S., Matthews, R., Kämpf, J. and Van Ruth, P. D. (2006), Pelagic ecology of a northern boundary current system: effects of upwelling on the production and distribution of sardine (Sardinops sagax), anchovy (Engraulis australis) and southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) in the Great Australian Bight. Fisheries Oceanography, 15: 191–207. {{doi|10.1111/j.1365-2419.2006.00353.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During upwelling events, surface [[chlorophyll a]] concentrations, an indicator of phytoplankton abundance, increase tenfold.&lt;ref name="Kampf"/&gt;{{rp|2}} Phytoplankton blooms bring about swarms of [[krill]], which in turn attract [[blue whale]]s. Blue whales are found in various locations off the southeast coast of Australia, but most predominantly in the Bonney Upwelling region, which is one of 12 identified blue whale feeding sites worldwide. Marine biologist Peter Gill estimates that 100 blue whales visit the Bonney Upwelling area every year, ranging over {{convert|18,000|km2|sqmi}} of ocean from [[Robe, South Australia]] to [[Cape Otway]] in [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]]. The feeding grounds may extend further northwest, encompassing the rest of the GSACUS, but incomplete whale surveys are insufficient to establish their true range.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|2; 20–24}}&lt;ref name="Diary"&gt;Clevers, Jeni. [http://www.abc.net.au/nature/bigblue/diary.htm Producer's Diary]. ‘’The Big Blue’’. [[Australian Broadcasting Company]], 2007. Accessed 16 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other marine life that thrives in the upwelling includes filter feeders like [[sea sponge|sponge]]s, [[bryozoan]]s, and [[coral]]s. These animals feed predators such as seabirds, fishes, [[Australian fur seal]]s, and [[penguin]]s.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|ii}} The upwelling plays also an important role in the life cycle of juvenile southern bluefin tuna (''[[Thunnus maccoyii]]''), which accumulate in the eastern Great Australian Bight during the upwelling season and feed on sardines (''[[Sardinops sagax]]'') and anchovies (''[[Engraulis australis]]'').&lt;ref name="Ward"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willis, J., and Hobday, A. J. (2007). Influence of upwelling on movement of southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) in the Great Australian Bight. Marine and Freshwater Research 58, 699–708.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the many dead organisms that [[Marine snow|fall to the continental shelf]] support populations of [[southern rock lobster]] and [[Tasmanian giant crab|giant crab]].&lt;ref name="Festival"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upwellingfestival.com.au/page.asp?landing=1&amp;id=362|title=Portland Upwelling Festival - The Bonney Upwelling|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=12 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326153210/http://www.upwellingfestival.com.au/page.asp?landing=1&amp;id=362|archivedate=26 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic Importance===

The GSACUS supports a productive fishery, and local fishers recognize the bounty that the upwelling provides them.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|26}} Every November, [[Portland, Victoria]] hosts an [http://www.upwellingfestival.com.au Upwelling Festival] to celebrate the abundance of the Bonney Upwelling, and to begin the summer fishing season.&lt;ref name="Festival"/&gt;

Humans have exploited the GSACUS for thousands of years. Oral histories of local Aboriginal tribes indicate a close connection to the ocean, and said tribes may possibly have eaten [[beached whale]]s.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|36}} The [[Convincing Ground massacre]], which took place near [[Portland, Victoria]] in 1829, arose over a dispute between [[Whaling in Australia|European whalers]] and the [[Gunditjmara people]] over ownership of a beached whale.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Ian D. Clark, pp17-22, ''Scars on the Landscape. A Register of Massacre sites in Western Victoria 1803-1859'', Aboriginal Studies Press, 1995 {{ISBN|0-85575-281-5}} Excerpt also published on [http://museumvictoria.com.au/encounters/journeys/Robinson/convincing_ground.htm Museum Victoria website], accessed 26 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the mid-1840s, whaling and sealing were established as organized industries off the Bonney Coast.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|27}}

Today, [[southern rock lobster]] (referred to locally as crayfish) and [[trawling]] are the most important fishing industries in the Bonney Upwelling.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|ii;28}} whereas the upwelling off the Eyre Peninsula supports a large sardine fishery, operating chiefly out of [[Port Lincoln, South Australia]].&lt;ref name="Alongshore"/&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sasardines.com.au/links-resources.html |title=South Australian Sardine Industry Inc |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==

Next to the [[Great Barrier Reef]], the GSACUS and its ecosystem can be regarded as one of Australia's natural wonders. Due to its importance as a blue whale feeding and aggregation site, in 2002 the Bonney Upwelling was listed as critical habitat "requiring effective protection from user impacts"&lt;ref&gt;Australia.

Accessed 16 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; under Australia's [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]].&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|i-viii;3}} In addition to the blue whale, one species of [[shark]] is listed as [[critically endangered]], and 5 bird and 2 whale species are listed as [[endangered species|endangered]].&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|17}}

Significant reserves of [[natural gas]] are present beneath the Bonney Coast, and are undergoing exploration.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|33}} Fears have been expressed that expanded gas drilling may threaten whales through [[Noise pollution#Wildlife|noise pollution]] and ship collisions.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|iii}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A deep mystery unfolds |first=Melissa |last=Fyfe |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/04/30/1083224581530.html |newspaper=The Age |date=1 May 2004 |accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hope Spots''' are ecologically unique areas of the ocean designated for protection under a global conservation campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2016/06/08/hope-spots-an-actionable-plan-to-save-the-ocean/|title=Hope Spots: An Actionable Plan to Save the Ocean|last=Garling|first=Brett|date=2016-06-08|website=National Geographic Society (blogs)|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; overseen by Mission Blue, a non-profit organization founded by [[Sylvia Earle]] with her 2009 [[TED (conference)|TED]] prize wish.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/participate/ted-prize/prize-winning-wishes/mission-blue|title=Sylvia Earle imagines ocean "Hope Spots"|website=www.ted.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hope Spots can be [[Marine protected area|Marine Protected Areas]] (MPA) that need attention or new sites. They are chosen for their contributions to biodiversity, the carbon sink, and important habitat. Hope Spot status is intended to alleviate the pressures human resource extraction places on the ocean by making the site higher priority to become an MPA, where resource extraction, like fishing and drilling, may be forbidden under law.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mission-blue.org/hope-spots/|title=Hope Spots – Mission Blue|website=www.mission-blue.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 76 Hope Spots worldwide (as of September 9, 2016).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/news/secretariat/201609/new-ocean-hope-spots-vetted-iucn-and-mission-blue-ignite-global-support-ocean-protection|title=New ocean Hope Spots, vetted by IUCN and Mission Blue, to ignite global support for ocean protection|date=2016-09-09|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-04-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional 22 nominations for Hope Spots are currently under consideration and three nominations have been deferred.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

At the time of Earle's wish, less than 1% of the ocean was protected. Earle advocated for the creation of a system of parks like the [[national park]] system in the United States. The goal of the Hope Spot campaign is raise public support, gain the attention of leaders and policy makers, and ultimately create enough Hope Spots to protect 20% of the ocean by 2020.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{cquote|I wish you would use all means at your disposal — films! expeditions! the web! new submarines! — to create a campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas, Hope Spots large enough to save and restore the blue heart of the planet. —Sylvia Earle}}

== Nominations process ==

Since September 9, 2016, nominations for Hope Spots have been open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mission-blue.org/2016/09/hope-spot-nominations-open-to-the-public/|title=Hope Spot Nominations Open to the Public!|website=www.mission-blue.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the completion of the Hope Spot nomination form found on Mission Blue's website, a proposed Hope Spot is evaluated to assess its validity. The Hope Spots Council, composed of marine scientists and policy experts, examine new nominations twice a year and choose which sites to designate as Hope Spots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mission-blue.org/hope-spots-council/|title=Hope Spots Council – Mission Blue|website=www.mission-blue.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnerships ==

Mission Blue has partnered with the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) and receives support from [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]], [[Rolex]], and [[Google]]. To increase access and promote the campaign, Google has added Hope Spots to its platform enabling users to explore the sites.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A Google-powered map of Hope Spots can be found on Mission Blue's website.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Green &amp; Fresh Environment In Katopuri Village,, A Cool Place...jpg|thumb]]
'''Labour''' and the '''environment''' are two different concepts that can be linked as one. Labour is defined as a task that is performed, typically for an economic return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/labour|title=the definition of labour|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural environment|Environment]] is defined as air, water, minerals, organisms, and all factors that contribute to ecology.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It is the gregarious and cultural pressures that builds the lives of individuals or an entire population.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/environment|title=Environment {{!}} Define Environment at Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human labour in the forms of [[Logging]], [[Environmental impact of mining|Mining]], and [[environmental impact of tourism|Tourism]], have negatively impacted the functions of the environment in various countries that are part of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD) forum. The OECD is a list of 34 countries whose governments work together to ensure that the market economies function accordingly and strive to increase economic growth, wealth and sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://usoecd.usmission.gov/mission/overview.html|title=What is the OECD? {{!}} OECD - United States Mission|website=usoecd.usmission.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impacts of labour on the environment have been so large that many corporations and campaigns have begun, striving to change the way humans exert their abilities on the environment by implementing policies to limit negative outcomes.

Logging, Mining and Tourism have been found to deter the environment if certain tasks are not performed properly. Logging has created such a negative effect on [[New Zealand]] in particular, that a 3 year ban had been placed on logging to attempt to preserve the environment and reconstruct it to its original structure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=L.W.|title=Decision making and the logging industry: An example from New Zealand|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0006320780900750|journal=Biological Conservation|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=101–115|doi=10.1016/0006-3207(80)90075-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects are dated as far back as 1960. At the end of the second world war, there were about 100,000 hectares of native forest, whereas today there is less than 17,000 hectares remaining in West Taupo District in [[New Zealand]] and many endangered species that resided in these forests are now extinct as a cause of logging.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In terms of [[Environmental impact of mining|mining]], the conflicts that have surfaced in [[Peru]] revolve around the inexperience workers that are hired to perform these tasks that incur a greater damage to the environment as they are not aware of the harm they are doing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arellano-Yanguas|first=Javier|date=2011-04-01|title=Aggravating the Resource Curse: Decentralisation, Mining and Conflict in Peru|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00220381003706478|journal=The Journal of Development Studies|volume=47|issue=4|pages=617–638|doi=10.1080/00220381003706478|issn=0022-0388}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a weakness around the [[environmental regulation]] in comparison to mining and many companies have taken over and negatively affected the environment in order to invest their wealth into new mining operations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, [[Ecotourism|tourism]] has contributed a great amount of stress to the environment. When individuals from other countries are visiting these OECD countries that are under great distress with the environment and pollution, in many cases they provide more harm than good by littering or removing plants or flowers as a souvenir but are unaware that the souvenirs are part of an endangered species.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/949882759|title=Environment and Tourism.|last=Andrew.|first=Holden,|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=1317664094|oclc=949882759}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of tourism has resulted in damage towards the environment in many ways. Tourism has led to the growth of airports, hotels, and other organizations that have stripped away land in order to build and grow in the [[economic sector]]. Although tourism can have a positive impact on the economy it results in an environmentally unsustainable model for many areas.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The relationship between human labour and the [[Natural environment|environment]] and the types of work that humans have participated in have created a negative impact on many aspects of the environment including [[climate change]] and has resulted in the emerging [[green economy]]. The primary cause of climate change is humans and their work towards the environment overtime. A result of this has been the policies that have been put into place to ensure the environment will be protected moving forwards and to establish alternate routes for individuals when available to preserve the environment. The key focus is on the impact of human work on the environment, and the impact of the environment on human work. The green economy has emerged as a result of the negative outcomes. Specifically to [[Limpopo|Limpopo, Africa]], there have been so many negative contributions affecting the way the environment functions that they have created a project to help reduce this issue.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/881089073|title=The emerging policy for green economy and social development in Limpopo, South Africa|last=K.|first=Musyoki, Agnes|date=2012-01-01|publisher=UNRISD|isbn=9789290850908|oclc=881089073}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project contributes to the green economy and has created policies that will be implemented to reduce negative outcomes and alternative routes when attaining energy, goods, infrastructure, etc.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Causes ==

=== Logging ===
[[File:Logging Bulletwood Berbice-Guyana JK.JPG|thumb]]
Logging has turned into a negative concept throughout many areas due to the way humans go about it. We have now relied on logging as a major contributor to our resources that it has been difficult to cut down and has turned into a negative factor. Specifically to [[New Zealand]], there has been a 3 year ban put into place to try to conserve the environment and attempt to reconstruct the environment back to its original standards.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is because the West Taupo forest that is located in [[Pureora Forest Park|Pureora]], is the last forest remaining causing a great deal of stress to preserve the land.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The most serious issues surrounding these native forests have resulted in a socio-economic consideration as well as conservation problems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While viewing this issue in another light, conservationists are claiming that logging has already made too big of an impact to turn back.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In spite of the many protests and bans that have been placed, logging throughout these forests is still taking place today.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The effects of logging have also been negative on the rate of [[erosion]] throughout many places, specifically in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=R.|first=Nasi,|last2=S.|first2=Wunder,|last3=J.J.|first3=Campos A.,|date=2002-01-01|title=Forest ecosystem services: can they pay our way out of deforestation?|url=http://www.cifor.org/nc/online-library/browse/view-publication/publication/1199.html|journal=Center for International Forestry Research|language=english}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists have found that the rate of erosion in the Philippines has increased by four times due to conventional logging.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Roads were one of the main outcomes of logging and although they only typically cover a small amount of the area being logged, they cover over 80% of the surface erosion.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Mining ===
[[File:This 750-megawatt power plant, located on the north platte river, is part of the massive strip-mining development planned..., 06-1973 (7065822315).jpg|thumb]]
Over the course of many years, [[Peru]] specifically has been the main resources of [[copper]], [[tin]], [[silver]], [[gold]], [[zinc]] and [[natural gas]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There has been many conflicts around labour in terms of the experience workers have prior to starting their job.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to the high demand of workers in the mining industry, there has been a great deal of employees being hired with little to no work experience to perform these specific tasks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They are also less likely to change professions as they are being paid a large salary greater than professions that require a high deal of experience like [[health workers]], and [[police officer]]s, etc.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These workers do not have any knowledge on the negative impacts that mining seems to have on the environment causing them to do more harm than good.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There has also been a weakness around [[Environmental law|environmental regulation]] when it comes to [[mining]] in [[Peru]]. This is seen especially through the [[Ministry of Energy and Mines (Peru)|Ministry of Energy and Mines]] as they are responsible for the overall production and regulations with Mining.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Their responsibilities are more often neglected as their main concern is wealth as opposed to the environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Mining requires a great deal of site preparation and clearing at times.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elaw.org/mining-eia-guidebook|title=Guidebook for Evaluating Mining Project EIAs {{!}} ELAW|website=www.elaw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be a negative effect on the environment if they are performing this task through an ecologically sensitive area.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Even prior to mining, many activities that are linked to the process of preparing the land for mining have a significantly negative effect on these sensitive areas.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

A result of human labour has effected the environment in terms of [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]] throughout wildlife.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Many species have been effected from mining companies stripping the land to benefit economically.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This can also be effected when the homes of these species are being polluted with the wastes that derive from mining projects.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Also, in terms of [[lake]]s and [[pond]]s, the [[fish]] and [[wildlife]] found inside these [[stream]]s can be impacted if they are drained or [[Pollution|polluted]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The mining company has done more harm than good throughout many aspects of the environment, doing everything they can to gain an economic prosperity regardless of the environmental effects.

=== Tourism ===
Tourism has the ability to transform many areas into an economically beneficial project. It has become a major industry throughout all over the world regardless of the many stressors that can be contributed to the environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Tourism can negatively effect the lives of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] people who may be depending on these resources to survive.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When using nature as a resource for an economic benefit it negatively impact the lives of these [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] individuals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[File:Litter in Sundarbans.jpg|thumb]]
One of the major issues with tourism is the [[litter]]ing that tourists tend to contribute to. When tourists are littering they are not only effecting the environment but they are also effecting the animals among that [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The consumption of litter amongst these animals can result in illness and death.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Not only can this factor into the land but also the [[organism]]s in the sea by breaking [[coral]] and also frightening animals or bringing illness and death among them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[File:Nagoya Airport view from promenade.jpg|left|thumb]]
Tourism has also impacted the environment when having to expand resources for the industry to grow. Tourism can link to the effects of [[logging]], as there have been areas torn down in order to expand economically.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gdrc.org/uem/eco-tour/envi/one.html|title=Environmental Impacts of Tourism|website=www.gdrc.org|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spain]] has gained an increasing number of tourists over the years resulting in them having to expand in airports and hotels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This resource has resulted in stripping the environment to create these commodities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While using the environment to grow in the tourism industry, this demonstrates the unsustainable model being implemented in order to grow.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many resources, land and water, have been negatively effected in the process of expanding.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Effects ==

=== Climate change ===
[[File:Climate Change Attribution.png|thumb]]
Human labour on the environment have effected many factors, one being the ongoing issue of [[climate change]]. The main  attempt is to establish different routes to maintain the overall state of the environment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is done by creating policies to try to use alternative options for energy, goods, infrastructure, etc.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Certain human labour activities highly affect climate change in terms of air pollution.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ec.gc.ca/indicateurs-indicators/?lang=en&amp;n=D189C09D-1|title=Environment and Climate Change Canada - Environmental Indicators - Drivers and Impacts of Air Pollution|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Environment and Climate Change|website=www.ec.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs that require [[transport]]ation, [[electricity generation]], and [[List of industrial processes|industrial processes]] release pollution throughout the air everyday.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This can be through the high demand in [[import]]s and [[export]]s that require individuals to produce this pollution through their means of transporting these products.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The Global Union Research Network has worked extensively in trying to find alternative routes for services to have a smaller impact on climate change.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/968347410|title=The employment effects of climate change and climate change responses: a role for international labour standards?|last=Lene|first=Olsen,|date=2009-01-01|publisher=GURN|isbn=9789221228080|oclc=968347410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism has been affected from climate change due to the rise of sea levels causing some businesses close to the sea to shut down as a safety hazard.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; These policies are influenced by the strategies used when dealing with climate change and many of the financial crises.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Logging contributes to up to 15 percent of the [[carbon dioxide]] in the air.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/deforestation-and-global-warming/|title=Deforestation and Its Extreme Effect on Global Warming|work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is such a negative aspect towards the environment because when individuals are cutting down trees, they are releasing carbon out into the arm which then contributes to the greenhouse gases and global warming occurs.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; There has been more action taken place upon vehicles impacting the air then there is towards logging and vehicles produce about 14 percent of the carbon dioxide in the air, hinting that logging should be just as an important issue to the world.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Between the years of 2000 and 2009, there were 32 million acres of tropical rainforest that had been cut down per year, and each year this rate has been increasing.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; [[Environmental Defense Fund|Environmental Defence Fund]] states that unless something is done as an alternative route to logging, deforestation will release up to 200 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the air in the years coming.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|left|thumb]]
Mining has contributed to many of the air pollutions being released into the air.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ganguly|first=A. R.|last2=Steinhaeuser|first2=K.|date=2008-12-01|title=Data Mining for Climate Change and Impacts|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4733959/?reload=true|journal=2008 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops|pages=385–394|doi=10.1109/ICDMW.2008.30}}&lt;/ref&gt; When mining for these resources, inexperienced employees are creating many detrimental outcomes when mining in the wrong areas or hitting gas leaks.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In specifics to [[Coal mining|coal mines]], communities have no choice but to leave their land behind and move due to the expansion of these mines, and the water contamination from mining.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/Coal-mining-impacts/|title=About coal mining impacts|work=Greenpeace International|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; These companies are very quick to attain any sort of product through mining that they do not realize the great damage left behind once they have extracted what they need.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Acid mine drainage for instance, is just one of the issues that can continue on for decades, as a result of a minimal mining job.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Many campaigns are doing their best to ensure that communities find alternative routes to renewable energy to preserve the environment and decrease climate change.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Tourism has been greatly expanding over the years, and has also contributed a main factor of their expansion to climate change. By creating many of these new airports, attractions, etc, for tourists, it requires companies to tear down areas and rebuild a new company for the tourism industry to grow.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weaver|first=David|date=2011-01-01|title=Can sustainable tourism survive climate change?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09669582.2010.536242|journal=Journal of Sustainable Tourism|volume=19|issue=1|pages=5–15|doi=10.1080/09669582.2010.536242|issn=0966-9582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollutants are being released in the air as these companies build new areas.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; There is a lack of knowledge around tourism and climate change which has been a leading factor in the detrimental outcomes of tourism towards the environment.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Individuals continue to create new attractions for tourists to come see without realizing the consequences of their attraction towards the environment.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Many individuals act out by only thinking of the short and medium term benefits of their attraction and pay no mind to the long term effects to the environment such as air pollution and overall land protection.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Emerging green economy ===
The [[Green economy|emerging green economy]] is a way of trying to reduce [[resource consumption]], destructive emissions, and overall reducing all types of negative impacts towards the environment.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eco.ca/reports/defining-the-green-economy-2010/|title=Defining the Green Economy - ECO Canada|work=ECO Canada|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The green economy offers green products and services that benefit the environment.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

When the green economy first began to grow, there were 2 different approaches being taken, environmentally and economically. The environmental approach to this was to take all the negative environmental aspects into account and develop a sustainable route to each one through pricing, and land choices, etc.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gssd.mit.edu/search-gssd/site/green-growth-developing-countries-60418-sun-12-08-2013-0155|title=" Green growth in developing countries: a summary for policy makers" {{!}} Global System for Sustainable Development|website=gssd.mit.edu|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economic perspective also known as short term growth perspective; was all about increasing jobs and incomes by investing in [[Low-carbon economy|low carbon technologies]] to preserve the environment.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; More recently there has been a third approach to the green economy, equity and inclusion. This has been brought by developing countries, wanting the green growth approach to focus primarily on individuals and countries who are not part of the economic system.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

The green economy has been implemented in an attempt to preserve the environment. Policies in [[Limpopo]], [[Africa]], revolve around the needs of the economy and society to ensure it is maintaining its sustainable lifestyle.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/823763281|title=The emerging policy for green economy and social development in Limpopo, South Africa|last=Development.|first=United Nations Research Institute for Social|last2=Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung.|isbn=9789290850908|oclc=823763281}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Green Economy in Limpopo's main focus is to bring more jobs and increase the economy.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The green economy attempts to create this lifestyle in many different countries and areas.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

[[File:Humphreys Peak KPW.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Humphreys Peak]] is the highest summit of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Arizona|State of Arizona]].
]]

This article comprises three sortable tables of [[Summit|major mountain peaks]]&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Arizona|State of Arizona]].

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=NAVD_88&gt;All elevations in this article include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Highest major summits|first table]] below ranks the 20 highest major summits of Arizona by elevation.
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;  The [[#Most prominent summits|second table]] below ranks the 20 most prominent summits of Arizona.
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Most isolated major summits|third table]] below ranks the 20 most isolated major summits of Arizona.

==Highest major summits==
{{see also|List of mountains and hills of Arizona by height}}
{{GeoGroup|section=Highest major summits}}
Of the highest major summits of Arizona, [[Humphreys Peak]] exceeds {{convert|3500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of elevation, five peaks exceed {{convert|3000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, and 14 peaks exceed {{convert|2500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of elevation.

[[File:Gerardus Mercator 3.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Gerardus Mercator 1512–1594&lt;ref&gt;This portrait appears in the 1596 version of his [[:File:Atlas Cosmographicae (Mercator) 007.jpg|Atlas]] It was made in 1574, when Mercator was 62, by the engraver [[Frans Hogenberg]] who contributed many of the topographical images in Civitates Orbis Terrarum. See the [[:de:Frans Hogenberg|German wikipedia]] and [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Frans_Hogenberg commons].&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
The '''Mercator world map of 1569''' is titled ''Nova et Aucta Orbis Terrae Descriptio ad Usum Navigantium Emendate Accommodata'' ([[Renaissance Latin]] for "New and more complete representation of the terrestrial globe properly adapted for use in navigation"). The title shows that [[Gerardus Mercator]] aimed to present contemporary knowledge of the geography of the world and at the same time 'correct' the chart to be more useful to sailors. This 'correction', whereby constant bearing sailing courses on the sphere ([[rhumb lines]]) are mapped to straight lines on the plane map, characterizes the [[Mercator projection]]. While the map's geography has been superseded by modern knowledge, its projection proved to be one of the most significant advances in the history of cartography, inspiring map historian [[Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld|Nordenskiöld]] to write "The [[Gerardus Mercator|master of Rupelmonde]] stands unsurpassed in the history of cartography since the time of Ptolemy."&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFNordenskiöld1889|Nordenskiöld]] Facsimile Atlas, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; The projection heralded a new era in the evolution of navigation maps and charts and it is still their basis.

The map is inscribed with a great deal of text. The framed [[Legend (map)|map legends]] (or [[Cartouche (cartography)|cartouches]]) cover a wide variety of topics: a dedication to his patron and a copyright statement; discussions of rhumb lines, great circles and distances; comments on some of the major rivers; accounts of fictitious geography of the north pole and the southern continent. The full Latin texts and English translations of all the legends are given [[#Legend texts|below]]. Other minor texts are sprinkled about the map. They cover such topics as the magnetic poles, the prime meridian, navigational features, minor geographical details, the voyages of discovery and myths of giants and cannibals. These minor texts are also given [[#Minor texts|below]].

A comparison with [[#World maps before 1569|world maps before 1569]] shows how closely Mercator drew on the work of other cartographers and his own previous works, but he declares ([[#legend3|Legend 3]]) that he was also greatly indebted to many new charts prepared by Portuguese and Spanish sailors in the [[portolan chart|portolan]] tradition. Earlier cartographers of world maps had largely ignored the more accurate practical charts of sailors, and vice versa, but the age of discovery, from the closing decade of the fifteenth century, stimulated the integration of these two mapping traditions: Mercator's world map is one of the earliest fruits of this merger.

==Extant copies and facsimiles==
Mercator's 1569 map was a large planisphere,&lt;ref&gt;Planisphere here means a rendering of the sphere onto the plane. It has no relation to the star charts as described in the article [[planisphere]].&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. a projection of the spherical Earth onto the plane. It was printed in eighteen separate sheets from copper plates engraved by Mercator himself.&lt;ref&gt;See the biography of Mercator by Iris Kockelberg in [[#CITEREFImhof2012|''Mercator: exploring new horizons'']], pp95 –99.''&lt;/ref&gt; Each sheet measures 33×40&amp;nbsp;cm and, with a border of 2&amp;nbsp;cm, the complete map measures 202×124&amp;nbsp;cm. All sheets span a longitude of 60 degrees; the first row of 6 sheets cover latitudes 80°N to 56°N, the second row cover 56°N to 16°S and the third row cover 16°S to 66°S: this latitude division is not symmetric with respect to the equator thus giving rise to the later criticism of a Euro-centric projection.&lt;ref&gt;
[[#CITEREFMonmonier2004|Monmonier]], Chapter 10 and notes at page 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known how many copies of the map were printed, but it was certainly several hundred.&lt;ref&gt;The records of the [[Plantin Press]] show that they sold at least 185 copies of the 1569 map in the period 1569–1576 alone. See Leon Voet, ''Les relations commerciales entre Gerardus Mercator et la maison Plantiniene à Anvers'' in [[#CITEREFRenckhoff1962|Duisberger Forschungen]], pp.171–232, and Dirk Imhof in [[#CITEREFImhof2012|''Mercator: exploring new horizons'']], pp105 –107.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this large print run, by the middle of the nineteenth century there was only one known copy, that at the [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]]. 
A second copy was discovered in 1889 at the Stadt Bibliothek of Breslau&lt;ref&gt;The collections of the Stadt Bibliothek of Breslau, now the library of the [[University of Wrocław]], are described at {{cite web |url=http://liber-maps.kb.nl/articles/szykula6.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327031804/http://liber-maps.kb.nl/articles/szykula6.html |archivedate=27 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; along with maps of Europe and Britain.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} 
These three maps were destroyed by fire in 1945 but fortunately copies had been made before then.&lt;ref name=heyerA&gt;Heyer, A. ''Drei Karten–Mercator in der Breslauer Stadt-Bibliotek.'' Zeitschrift fur Wissenschaftliche Geographie herausgegeben von J.I.Kettler, vol VII (1890), pp. 379, 474, 507.&lt;/ref&gt; 
A third copy was found in a map collection ''Mappae Geographiae vetustae'' from the archives of the Amerbach family which had been given to the library of the [[University of Basel]].&lt;ref name="CITEREFvan_ 1961 page 40"/&gt; 
The only other complete copy was discovered at an auction sale in Luzern in 1932 and is now in the map collection of the 
[[Maritiem Museum Rotterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;
[[#CITEREFvan_'t_Hoff1961|van 't Hoff (1961)]], p.19&lt;/ref&gt; 
In addition to the complete copies there is a single page showing the North Atlantic in the Mercator atlas of Europe in the [[British Library]].&lt;ref&gt;
[[#CITEREFMercator1570|Mercator 1570 atlas]], Plate&amp;nbsp;14&lt;/ref&gt; 
Many paper reproductions of all four maps have been made. Those at full scale, providing access to the detail and the artistry of Mercator's engraving, are listed next. Images of the Basil, Paris, and Rotterdam impressions can be found online.

===Basel map===
The Basel map is the cleanest of the three extant versions. It is called the 'three strip' version because it is in three separate rows rather than a single assembled sheet. It was photographically reproduced at a reduced scale by Wilhelm Kruecken in 1992; more recently (2011) he has produced a full-scale and full sized (202×124&amp;nbsp;cm) reproduction of the map along with a five volume account (in German) covering all aspects of Mercator's work.&lt;ref&gt;
The publications of Wilhelm Krucken are available from the home page of his web site at
[http://www.wilhelmkruecken.de/ Ad maiorem Gerardi Mercatoris gloriam].

===Paris map===
The Paris copy is a single combined sheet that came into the possession of the Bibliothèque Nationale from the estate of [[Julius Klaproth]] (1783–1835).&lt;ref name="CITEREFvan_ 1961 page 40"&gt;[[#CITEREFvan_'t_Hoff1961|van 't Hoff (1961)]], page 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The map is uncoloured, partially borderless and in poor condition due to repeated exhibitions during the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="CITEREFvan_ 1961 page 40"/&gt; It was reproduced by [[Edmé-François Jomard]] (1777–1862) between 1842 and 1862 as part of a collection of 21 facsimile maps. Very few copies of this facsimile are known.

The Bibliothèque Nationale has put a digital image of their copy into the public domain in the form of 13 separate images.&lt;ref&gt;http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b7200344k/f1.item Digital image of the BNF copy.&lt;/ref&gt; The images do not correspond exactly with the 18 original sheets: they are in three rows of different heights with 5, 4, 4 images respectively. The zoomable images permit examination of small sections of the map in very great detail. These are the only online images at a high enough resolution to read the smallest text.

===Breslau map===
Immediately after its discovery in 1889 the Breslau map was described by Heyer&lt;ref name=heyerA/&gt; who initiated copies (in multiple sheets) for the Berlin Geographical Society in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, A. Drei Karten von Europa, Britische Inseln, Weltkarte, herausgegeben von der Gesellschaft fur Erdkunde. Berlin 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; Forty years later, in 1931, a further 150 copies were issued by the [http://www.iho.int Hydrographic Bureau]
&lt;!--Some of these appear in the [[#List of 1569 map facsimile locations|List of Mercator 1569 map facsimile locations]].--&gt;

=== Rotterdam map ===
This copy in the [[Maritiem Museum Rotterdam]] is in the form of an atlas&lt;ref&gt;The term atlas, as a collection of maps, was not used for this volume. It was first applied to the Mercator atlas of 1594.&lt;/ref&gt; constructed by Mercator for his friend and patron Werner von Gymnich.&lt;ref&gt;
[[#CITEREFvan_'t_Hoff1961|van 't Hoff (1961), p.19]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was made by Mercator in (or shortly after) 1569 by dissecting and reassembling three copies of his original wall map to create coherent units such as continents or oceans or groups of legends.&lt;ref&gt;
[[#CITEREFMonmonier2004|Monmonier]] Figure 4.2, page 51&lt;/ref&gt;  There are 17 non-blank coloured pages which may be viewed online (and  zoomed to a medium resolution, much lower than that of the French copy at the Bibliothèque Nationale).&lt;ref&gt;A digital copy of this map may be viewed online at [http://www.maritiemdigitaal.nl/index.cfm?event=search.getsimplesearch&amp;saveToHistory=1&amp;database=ChoiceMardig&amp;searchterm=mercator+1569&amp;needImages=YES Maritiem Digitaal]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 a monochrome facsimile of this atlas was produced jointly by the curators of the Rotterdam museum and the cartographic journal Imago Mundi.&lt;ref&gt;
[[#CITEREFvan_'t_Hoff1961|van 't Hoff (1961)]],&lt;/ref&gt; The plates are accompanied with comprehensive bibliographic material, a commentary by van 't Hoff and English translations of the Latin text from the Hydrographics Review.&lt;ref name=ihb&gt;

==Principal features of the 1569 Mercator map==

===Mercator's projection===
{{main|Mercator projection}}
[[File:Guillaume Brouscon. World chart, which includes America and a large Terra Java (Australia). HM 46. PORTOLAN ATLAS and NAUTICAL ALMANAC. France, 1543.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A sea chart of the [[Dieppe maps|Dieppe school]] with parallel meridians and uniformly spaced orthogonal parallels. c1543]] 
In [[#legend3|Legend 3]] Mercator states that his first priority is "to spread on a plane the surface of the sphere in such a way that the positions of places shall correspond on all sides with each other, both in so far as true direction and distance are concerned and as correct longitudes and latitudes." He goes on to point out the deficiencies of previous projections,&lt;ref&gt;Some of the projections used in the period before 1569 are shown in the [[#World and regional maps before 1569|gallery]]. They are discussed in Snyder ([[#CITEREFSnyder1993|Flattening the Earth]] Chapter 1 ) and also in his article in the [[#CITEREFSnyder1993|History of Cartography]].
&lt;/ref&gt;
particularly the distortion caused by the oblique incidence of parallels and meridians which gives rise to incorrect angles and shapes: therefore he adopts parallel meridians and orthogonal parallels. This is also a feature of sixteenth century [[Nautical chart|plane charts]] ([[equirectangular projection]]s) but they also have equally spaced parallels; in [[#legend3|Legend 3]] Mercator also emphasizes the distortion that this gives rise to. In particular, the straight lines emanating from the compass roses are not rhumb lines so that they do not give a true bearing. Nor was it straightforward to calculate the sailing distances on these charts. Mariners were aware of these problems and had evolved rules of thumb{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} to enhance the accuracy of their navigation.

Mercator presents his remedy for these problems: "We have progressively increased the degrees of latitude towards each pole in proportion to the lengthenings of the parallels with reference to the equator." 
The resulting variation of the latitude scale is shown on the meridian at 350°E of his map. Later, [[Edward Wright (mathematician)|Edward Wright]] and others showed how this statement of Mercator could be turned into a precise mathematical problem whose solution permitted the calculation of the latitude scale, but their methods had not been developed at the time of Mercator.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMonmonier2004|Monmonier]], Chapter 5 and notes at page 191.&lt;/ref&gt;
All these methods hinge on the observation that the circumference of a parallel of latitude is proportional to the cosine of the latitude, which is unity at the equator and zero at the poles. The length of a parallel, and hence the spacing of the parallels, must therefore be increased by a factor equal to the reciprocal of the cosine (i.e. the secant) of the latitude.

Mercator left no explanation of his own methods but, as long ago as 1541, he had demonstrated that he understood how to draw rhumb lines on a globe.&lt;ref&gt;The curved rhumb lines on the terrestrial globe of 1541 are clearly visible. Images of the copy of the Globe in the British Maritime Museum may be found in ''Globes at Greenwich'' by Elly Dekker.&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been suggested that he drew the rhumbs by using a set of metal templates for the seven principal compass points within each quadrant, as follows.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Starting at the equator draw a short straight line segment, at say 67.5° (east by northeast). Continue as far as a meridian separated by only two or three degrees of longitude and mark the crossing point. Move the template to that point and repeat the process. Since the meridians have converged a little the line will bend up a little generating a rhumb which describes a spiral on the sphere. The latitude and longitude of selected points on the rhumb could have then been transferred to the chart and the latitude scale of the chart adjusted so that the rhumb becomes a straight line. There has been no shortage of proposed methods for the construction. For example, Hollander analyzed fourteen such hypotheses and concluded that Mercator ''may'' have used a judicious mix of mechanical transference and numerical interpolations.&lt;ref name=hollander&gt;Hollander, Raymond d'. (2005) ''Loxodromie et projection de Mercator''. Published by the Institut OceÌanographique (Paris). {{ISBN|9782903581312}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However he proceeded, Mercator achieved a fairly accurate, but not perfect, latitude scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFNordenskiöld1889|Nordenskiöld]] Facsimile Atlas, p.96.  Nordenskiöld claims that after allowing for possible shrinkage Mercator's latitude spacings are 1—2% greater than the calculated values.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the parallels shrink to zero length as they approach the pole they have to be stretched by larger and larger amounts. Correspondingly the parallel spacing must increase by the same ratio. Mercator concludes that "The chart cannot be extended as far as the pole, for the degrees of latitude would finally attain infinity." —[[#legend6|Legend 6]]. (That is, the reciprocal of the cosine of the latitude become infinite). He therefore uses a completely different projection for the inset map of the north polar regions: an [[azimuthal equidistant projection]].

It took many years for Mercator's projection to gain wider acceptance. The following gallery shows the first maps in which it was employed. General acceptance only came with the publication of the French sea atlas "Le Neptune Francois"{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;!--date needed--&gt; at the end of the seventeenth century: all the maps in this widely disseminated volume were on the Mercator projection.&lt;ref&gt;Le Neptune François ou receuil des cartes marines.

}}

===Distances and the Organum Directorium===
In [[#legend12|Legend 12]] Mercator makes careful distinction between [[great circle]]s (''plaga'') and [[rhumb line]]s (''directio'') and he points out that the rhumb between two given points is always longer than the great circle distance, the latter being the shortest distance between the points. However, he stresses that over short distances (which he quantifies) the difference may be negligible and a calculation of the rhumb distance may be adequate and more relevant since it is the sailing distance on a constant bearing. He gives the details of such a calculation in a rather cumbersome fashion in Legend&amp;nbsp;12 but in [[#legend10|Legend 10]] he says that the same method can be applied more readily with the Organum Directorium (the Diagram of Courses, [[Media:Mercator 1569 world map sheet 18.PNG|sheet 18]]) shown annotated here. Only dividers were used in these constructions but the original maps had a thread attached at the origin of each compass rose. Its use is partially explained in [[#legend10|Legend 10]].

[[File:Mercator 1569 map Organum Directorium2.svg|thumb|400px|The Organum Directorium with Mercator's constructions]] 
To illustrate his method take A at (20°N,33°E) and B at (65°N,75°E). Plot the latitude of A on the left hand scale and plot B with the appropriate relative latitude and longitude. Measure the azimuth α, the angle MAB: it can be read off the compass scale by constructing OP parallel to AB; for this example it is 34°. Draw a line OQ through the origin of the compass rose such that the angle between OQ and the equator is equal to the azimuth angle α. Now find the point N on the equator which is such that the number of equatorial degrees in ON is numerically equal to the latitude difference (45° for AM on the unequal scale). Draw the perpendicular through N and let it meet OQ at D. Find the point E such that OE=OD, here approximately 54°. This is a measure of the rhumb line distance between the points on the sphere corresponding to A and B on the spherical Earth. Since each degree on the equator corresponds to 60 [[nautical mile]]s the sailing distance is 3240 nautical miles for this example. If B is in the second quadrant with respect to A then the upper rose is used and if B is west of A then the longitude separation is simply reversed. Mercator also gives a refined method which is useful for small azimuths.

The above method is explained in [[#legend12|Legend 12]] by using compass roses on the equator and it is only in [[#legend10|Legend 10]] that he introduces the Organum Directorium and also addresses the inverse problems: given the initial point and the direction and distance of the second find the latitude and longitude of the second.

Mercator's construction is simply an evaluation of the rhumb line distance in terms of the latitude difference and the azimuth as&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Peter

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;
s=(\phi_B-\phi_A)\sec\alpha.
&lt;/math&gt;
If the latitude difference is expressed in arc minutes then the distance is in nautical miles.

In later life Mercator commented that the principles of his map had not been understood by mariners but he admitted to his friend and biographer, [[Walter Ghym]], that the map lacked a sufficiently clear detailed explanation of its use.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFvan_'t_Hoff1961|van 't Hoff]]&lt;/ref&gt; The intention expressed in the last sentence of [[#legend10|Legend 10]], that he would give more information in a future 'Geographia', was never realized.

===Prime meridian and magnetic pole===
[[File:Mercator 1569 world map detail magnetic poles.gif|thumb|left|200px|Two possible magnetic poles]]

In [[#legend5|Legend 5]] Mercator argues that the [[Prime Meridian]] should be identified with that on which the [[magnetic declination]] is zero, namely the meridian through the Cape Verde islands, or alternatively that through the island of Corvo in the Azores. (He cites the varying opinions of the [[Dieppe maps|Dieppe mariners]]). The prime meridian is labelled as 360 and the remainder are labelled every ten degrees eastwards. He further claims that he has used information on the geographical variation of declination to calculate the position of the (single) magnetic pole corresponding to the two possible prime meridians: they are shown on 
[[Media:Mercator 1569 world map sheet 06.PNG|Sheet6]] with appropriate [[#minor6|text]]. 
(For good measure he repeats one of these poles on 
[[Media:Mercator 1569 world map sheet 01.png|Sheet 1]] to emphasize the overlap of the right and left edges of his map; see [[#minor1|text]]). 
He does not show a position for a south magnetic pole. The model of the Earth as a magnetic dipole did not arise until the end of the seventeenth century,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} so between AD 1500 and that era the number of magnetic poles was a matter for speculation, variously 1, 2 or 4.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFvan_Nouhuys1933|van Nouhuys]], p.239&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he accepted that magnetic declination changed in time, thus invalidating his position that the prime meridian could be chosen on these grounds.

===Geography===
In his introduction to the Imago Mundi facsimile edition t' Hoff gives lists of [[#World maps before 1569|world maps]] and [[#Regional maps before 1569|regional maps]] that Mercator may well have seen, or even possessed by the 1560s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFvan_'t_Hoff1961|van 't Hoff]] Appendices F, G.&lt;/ref&gt; 
A more complete illustrated list of world maps of that time may be compiled from the comprehensive survey of [[#CITEREFShirley2001|Shirley]]. Comparisons with his own map show how freely he borrowed from these maps and from his own 1538 world map&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFNordenskiöld1889|Nordenskiöld]] Facsimile Atlas&lt;/ref&gt; and his 1541 globe.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

[[File:Eastern Mediterranean and Aegean Sea. Battista Agnese, PORTOLAN ATLAS (Italy ca. 1550).jpg|thumb|250px|right|A 1550 portolan of the eastern Mediterranean showing the high quality of coastal mapping.]]
In addition to published maps and manuscripts Mercator declares ([[#legend3|Legend 3]]) that he was greatly indebted to many new charts prepared by Portuguese and Spanish sailors in the [[portolan]] traditions. ''"It is from an equitable conciliation of all these documents that the dimensions and situations of the land are given here as accurately as possible."'' Earlier cartographers of world maps had largely ignored the more accurate practical charts of sailors, and vice versa, but the age of discovery, from the closing decades of the fifteenth century, brought together these two traditions in the person of Mercator.&lt;ref&gt;Penrose, B. 1932. ''Travel and discovery in the Renaissance, 1420–1620''. Cambridge, mass.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are great discrepancies with the modern atlas. Europe, the coast of Africa and the eastern coast of the Americas are relatively well covered but beyond that the anomalies increase with distance. For example, the spectacular bulge on the western coast of South America adapted from Ruscelli's 1561 ''Orbis Descriptio'' &lt;!--But note that this was something of a sputtering evolution; the bulge appears in suggestive form from an anonymous 1535 map &gt; Münster's bizarre 1540 portrayal &gt; Mercator's own 1541 &gt; Münster 1550 &gt; Tramezzino 1554 &gt;  --&gt; replaced the more accurate representation of earlier maps. That mistake disappears for good with the Blaeu map of 1606.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFBlaeu1606|Blaeu (1606)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mediterranean basin]] shows errors similar to those found in contemporary maps. For example, the latitude of the [[Black Sea]] is several degrees too high, like in the maps made by [[Diogo Ribeiro]] in [[Seville]] in the 1520s.&lt;ref name=Gaspar2015&gt;{{cite conference |url= https://www.academia.edu/15798235/Revisiting_Mercator_s_world_map_of_1569_an_assessment_of_navigational_accuracy_text_ |title= Revisiting Mercator’s world map of 1569: an assessment of navigational accuracy |last1= Alves Gaspar |first1= Joaquim |date= July 2016 |location=Antwerp }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Mercator's map the longitude of the entire basin is exaggerated by about 25%, contrary to the very accurate shape depicted by Ribeiro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robles Macías|first1=Luis A.|title=The longitude of the Mediterranean throughout history: facts, myths and surprises|journal=e-Perimetron|date=2014|volume=9|issue=1|pages=1–29|url=http://www.e-perimetron.org/Vol_9_1/Robles.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frisland Mercator.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Frisland, a [[phantom island]] (as represented on the 1595 Mercator atlas]]
The [[phantom island]]s of [[Frisland]] and [[Brasil (mythical island)|Brasil]] in the North Atlantic persist in the maps of the period even though they were in waters readily accessed by European sailors. He does show a Strait of Anian between Asia and the Americas as well as NW and NE passages to the spice islands of the East: this he justifies on his studies of the ancient texts detailed in [[#legend3|Legend 3]] for as yet these were unexplored regions.
[[File:Mercator Septentrionalium Terrarum descriptio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The north polar regions as portrayed in the 1595 atlas.]]
The bizarre representation of the geography of the north polar regions in the inset
is discussed in detail in [[#legend6|Legend 6]] and in the [[#minor13|minor texts]] of [[Media:Mercator 1569 world map sheet 13.PNG|sheet 13]]. Mercator accepts that a fourteenth-century English friar had employed magic arts to survey the septentrional regions. The four channels carry the sea ''towards'' the pole where it disappears into an abyss with great force.

Mercator accepted current beliefs in the existence of a large Southern continent ([[Terra Australis]]) — beliefs which would prevail until the discovery of the open seas south of Cape Horn and the circumnavigation of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |ref=harv

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; His biographer, Walter Ghim, explained that  even though Mercator was not ignorant that the Austral continent still lay hidden and unknown, he believed it could be "demonstrated and proved by solid reasons and arguments to yield in its geometric proportions, size and weight, and importance to neither of the other two, nor possibly to be lesser or smaller, otherwise the constitution of the world could not hold together at its centre".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Ghim, "Vita…Gerardi Mercatoris Rupelmundani", ''Gerardi Mercatoris Atlas sive Cosmographice Meditationes de Fabrica Mundi et Fabricate Figura,'' Amsterdami, 1606, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond Europe the interiors of the continents were unknown but Mercator struggled to
combine the scattered data at his disposal into a harmonious whole in the map legends which speculate on the Asian Prester John and the courses of the Ganges, Nile and Niger. For his geographical information Mercator quotes ([[#legend3|Legends 3]], [[#legend4|4]], [[#legend8|8]], [[#legend11|11]], [[#legend14|14]]) classic authors such as [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Pomponius Mela]], [[Ptolemy]], and earlier travellers such as [[Marco Polo]] but, as the principal geographer of his time, he would have undoubtedly have been in touch with contemporary travellers.

=== Navigatonal inaccuracy ===
Mercator was not a navigator himself and, while he was obviously aware of the concept of [[rhumb line]], he missed several key practical aspects of navigation. As a result, his world map "was useless for navigation at the time it was created because navigation was something very different from his idealized concept."&lt;ref name=Gaspar2015/&gt;

Mercator had to work from the geographic information contained in his source maps, which of course was not always accurate, but he may have also introduced errors of his own by misinterpreting the mathematical structure of the Portuguese and Spanish charts of his time. In addition, even if his sources had been perfect, Mercator's map would have still been of little practical use for navigators due to lack of reliable data on [[magnetic declination]] and to the difficulty of determining [[longitude]] accurately at sea.&lt;ref name=Gaspar2015/&gt;

These technical reasons explain why Mercator's projection was not widely adopted for marine charts until the 18th century.&lt;ref name=Gaspar2015/&gt;

The ornate border of the map shows the 32 [http://www.compassmuseum.com/diverstext/cardinals.htm points of the compass]. The cardinal appoints appear in various forms: west is ''Zephyrus, Occides, West, Ponente, Oeste;'' east is ''Subsola, Oriens, Oost, Levante, Este;'' south is ''Auster, Meridio, Zuya Ostre, Sid''; north is ''Boreas, Septentrio, Nord, tramontana.'' All of the other 28 points are written only in Dutch, confirming Mercator's wish that his map would be put to practical use by mariners.

Within the map Mercator embellishes the open seas with fleets of ships, sea creatures, of which one is a dolphin, and a striking god-like figure which may be Triton.
The unknown continental interiors are remarkably devoid of creatures and Mercator is for the most part content to create speculative mountain ranges, rivers and cities. The only land animal, in South America, is shown as ''"…having under the belly a receptacle in which it keeps its young warm and takes them out but to suckle them."'' ([[Media:Mercator 1569 world map sheet 10.PNG|(40°S,295°E)]] with [[#minor14|text]].) He also shows cannibals but this may have been true. The giants shown in Patagonia may also be founded in truth: the reaction of Spanish sailors of slight stature on confronting a tribe of natives who were well over six foot in height. These images of South Americans are almost direct copies of similar figures on the [[#World and regional maps before 1569]] map of [[Diego Gutiérrez (cartographer)|Diego Gutierrez]].&lt;ref&gt;
The Gutierez map of 1562 is available on several web sites:

The are three other images of figures: 
Prester John in Ethiopia [[Media:Mercator 1569 world map sheet 10.PNG|(10°N,60°E)]]; 
a tiny vignette of two 'flute' players [[Media:Mercator 1569 world map sheet 06.PNG|(72°N,170°E)]] (see [[#minor6|text]]);
the [[Golden Woman|Zolotaia baba]] at [[Media:Mercator 1569 world map sheet 05.PNG|(60°N,110°E)]]. (Zolotaia baba may also may be found on the [[Media:Mercator Septentrionalium Terrarum descriptio.jpg|Mercator map of the North Pole]] near the right border at mid-height).

The italic script used on the map was largely developed by Mercator himself. He was a great advocate of its use, insisting that it was much clearer than any other. He published an influential book, ''Literarum latinorum'', showing how the italic hand should be executed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFvan_'t_Hoff1961|van 't Hoff p.40]] The latin text and an English translation may be found in [[#CITEREFOsley1969|Osley]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Happy countries, happy kingdoms in which Justice, noble progeny of Jupiter, reigns eternal and where Astraea, having regrasped her sceptre, associates herself with divine goodness, raising her eyes straight to the heavens, governs all in accordance with the will of the Supreme Monarch and devotes herself to the submission of unfortunate mortals to His sole empery, seeking happiness.

There undisturbed Peace, companying with all-powerful Justice which guides it, and Piety, which no trials have cast down, make the curb pleasant, easy and firm thanks to the loving obedience of the peoples and, by Divine favour, hearts ever become greater, come such fortune as may; and though Impiousness, the enemy of virtue, causing Acheron to riot, raises some gloomy disorder, no terror is felt: this allgood Father who, residing on the crest of the world, orders all things by a nod of His head, will never desert His works or His kingdom.

When the citizen is in this wise governed he fears no ambush, he has no dread of horrible wars and mournful famine, all pretences are swept away from the unworthy backbiting of sycophants; Piety, and her beneficent sister Peace, either hinder or discover all malevolent deeds, the innocent herd alone is the object of praise, and honours are given to those only who employ their gifts in view of the common good; dishonesty, despised, lies prone, virtuous deeds everywhere call forth friendship and mutual treaties bind men solicitous of serving their King and their God.

Thus saintly reigns he to whom the sceptres have been given and, even so, He who gave them; thus they both rejoice that they have made an innocent flock which continues to prosper by justice and to ensue peace and which welcomes with a joyous heart and reflects holly the graces of the beneficent Spirit.

Rejoice, ye men of Cleves, rejoice ye of Juillers, a single house blesses you and He also, who alone compels kings, blesses you; there is nothing which can hinder you from being happy.

In hac orbis descriptione tria nobis curae fuerunt.

Primum sphaerae superficiem ita in planum extendere, ut situs locorum tam secundem directionem distantiamque veram quam secundum longitudinem latitudinemque debitam undequaque inter se correspondeant, ac regionum figurae in sphera apparentes, quatenus fieri potest, serventur, ad quod nova meridianorum ad parallelos habitudine et situs opus fuit, quae enim a geographis hactenus editae sunt conscriptiones meridianorum curvitate et ad invicem inclinatione inidoneae sunt ad navigationes, in extremitatibus quoque figuras situsque regionum, propter obliquam meridianorum in parallelos incidentiam, adeo mire distorquent, ut agnosci non possint, nec distantiarum rationes observari. In marinis nauclerorum tabulis gradus longitudinum per omnes parallelos usque in polum crescunt supra sphaericam rationem, nam perpetuo aequales manent gradibus aequatoris, at gradus latitudinum minime crescunt, quare ibi quoque distrahi enormiter figuras regionum necesse est, et vel longitudines ac latitudines, vel directiones distantiasque a vero aberrare, et cum magni ea causa errores committantur, ille caput est, quod trium locorum inscriptione ex uno aequinoctialis latere facta secundum triangularem aliquam dispositionem, si medius quivis extremis justa directione et distantia respondeat, {{Not a typo|impossibile}} sit extremos similiter inter se respondere, quibus consideratis gradus latitudinum versus utrumque polum paulatim auximus pro incremento parallelorum supra rationem quam habent ad aequinoctialem, quo id consecuti sumus, ut quomodocunque quis duos tres pluresve locos inscribat, modo ex his 4: differentia longitudinis, differentia latitudinis, distantia, directione, duo quaelibet in unoquoque loco ad alterum collato observet, recte se habebunt omnia in cujuslibet loci ad quemlibet collatione, et nullus uspiam error commissus reperietur, quem in vulgaribus naucleorum tabulis multis modis potissimum in majoribus latitudinibus admitti necesse est.

Alterum quod intendimus fuit, ut terrarum situs magnitudines locorumque distantias juxta ipsam veritatem quantum assequi licet exhiberemus, in hoc extremam diligentiam impendimus, marinas Castellanorum Portogalensiumque tabulas, tum inter se, tum cum plerisque navigationibus impressis et scriptis conferentes, ex quibus omnibus aequabiliter inter se conciliatis hanc terrarum dimensionem et situm damus, secundum ea quae hactenus observata sunt et ad nostras manus pervenire potuerunt castigatissimum.

Tertium quod tractandum suscepimus fuit: ostendere quae partes orbis et quousque veteribus innotuerint, quo antquae geographiae limites non {{Not a typo|ignorentur}}, et priscis saeculis suus honos deferatur. Dicimus autem tres esse distinctas continentes, primam e cujus medio creatum multiplicatumque genus humanum in omnem undique terram disseminatum est, secundam quae nova India dicitur, tertiam quae meridiano cardini subjacet.

Harum posteriores duae veteribus ignotae penitus permanserunt nisi forte nova India sit quae apud Platonem est Atlantis. Prima tametsi tota non fuerit a Ptolemeo in tabulas assumpta, omnis tamen ambitus ejus occeano terminari agnitus et maxima parte a veteribus descriptus est. Et quod ad tabularem Ptolemei descriptionem attinet, ex his, que de Gangis situ demonstravimus in hoc opere, constat eam comprehensis insulis quas ibi dicimus ab orientali parte as Thamum usque Cathai promontorium progredi, ubi (ut Melae placet) extremus Indiae angulus, meridionalis lateris terminus initiumque orientalis existit. A meridie hinc quidem ad Prassum Africae promontorium et Madagascar insulam, inde vero ad Hippodromum Aethiopiae in medio sinu Hesperico terminatur. Septentrionalis orae extrema post Cimbrorum promontorium est Livonia, sed assumptis simul insulis Scandia, Albione, Hibernia, Ebudibus, Orcadibus, et Islandia, quam certum est esse Thulen ex Plinio: lib :2. cap:75, et lib :4. cap :16, Solino cap :25, et Pomponio: Mela lib:3. cap:6. Reliquus ambitus septentrionalis a Plinio transcensis Riphaeis jugis describitur, et ex sinistro littore Scythici oceani Norvegiam Suediam et Finlandiam sub nominibus Balthia Basilia Scandinavia et Eningia perlustrat lib :4. cap :13, sed tanquam insulas, quod isthmum qui Finnicum sinum a Grandvico disjungit ignoraret. Dextrum littus prosequens lib :6. cap :13 primum post Hyperboreas gentes Lytarmem Riphei montis promontorium ponit, deinde Arimpheos plurimasque alias nationes quae circum mare Caspium ejusque ostia sunt, putabat enim in oceanum Scythicum erumpere, postea cap :17 residui littoris conditionibus et populis enarratis Tabin promontorium superat, et per conversam in orientem aestivum littorum faciem ad Seras procedit, denique in Indiam revertitur. Quod item reliquum erat Africae a Prasso promontorio ad sinum Hespericum, Jubae regis testimonio circumnavigabile dicit lib :6. cap :29, assignatis etiam aliquot stationibus ejus navigationis qua ex India in Mauretaniam itur. Et multo antea, ut est apud Herodotum: lib :4, jussu Nechaonis, Aegypti regis, Phoenices quidam Arabico sinu egressi bienno Africam usque ad columnas Herculis circumnavigarunt. Et postea Eudoxus quidam apud Melam, cum Lathyrum regem Alexandriae profugeret Arabico sinu egressus Gades usque pervectus est. Certum est igitur oceano cingi continentem nostram, et a veteribus ambitum ejus notum, ac pro maxima parte descriptum esse ipsorum {{Not a typo|autoritate}} constat, quare manifestum est errare eos qui novam Indiam cum Asia continentem faciunt, quemadmodum et eos qui Portogalensium navigationes Asiaticas longe Ptolemei descriptionem superare affirmant cum juxta ea quae de Gangis et Aureae situ adferimus multum adhuc ab ejusdem termino distare eas constet.

In making this representation of the world we had three preoccupations.

Firstly, to spread on a plane the surface of the sphere in such a way that the positions of places shall correspond on all sides with each other both in so far as true direction and distance are concerned and as concerns correct longitudes and latitudes; then, that the forms of the parts be retained, so far as is possible, such as they appear on the sphere. With this intention we have had to employ a new proportion and a new arrangement of the meridians with reference to the parallels. Indeed, the forms of the meridians, as used till now by geographers, on account of their curvature and their convergence to each other, are not utilisable for navigation; besides, at the extremities, they distort the forms and positions of regions so much, on account of the oblique incidence of the meridians to the parallels, that these cannot be recognised nor can the relation of distances be maintained. On the charts of navigators the degrees of longitude, as the various parallels are crossed successively towards the pole, become gradually greater with reference to their length on the sphere, for they are throughout equal to the degrees on the equator, whereas the degrees of latitude increase but very little,&lt;ref&gt;The Latin word ‘’minime’’ has been rendered "but very little" though it might just as well be translated "not at all". Indeed, it is possible that Mercator alludes to the fact that, already, attempts had been made to eliminate the difficulty of plane charts with parallels drawn at equal intervals. A work issued at the beginning of the 16th century, La Summa de Geographia by Enciso, states that upon a good chart the spacing of the parallels is not constant, it should increase with the latitude". (See: Gerhard Mercator, by H. Averdunk and Dr. J. Muller-Reinhard, p.129).&lt;/ref&gt; so that, on these charts also, the shapes of regions are necessarily very seriously stretched and either the longitudes and latitudes or the directions and distances are incorrect; thereby great errors are introduced of which the principal is the following: if three places forming any triangle on the same side of the equator be entered on the chart and if the central one, for example, be correctly placed with reference to the outer ones as to accurate directions and distances, it is impossible that the outer ones be so with reference to each other. It is for these reasons that we have progressively increased the degrees of latitude towards each pole in proportion to the lengthening of the parallels with reference to the equator; thanks to this device we have obtained that, however two, three or even more than three, places be inserted, provided that of these four quantities: difference of longitude, difference of latitude, distance and direction, any two be observed for each place associated with another, all will be correct in the association of any one place with any other place whatsoever and no trace will anywhere be found of any of those errors which must necessarily be encountered on the ordinary charts of shipmasters, errors of all sorts, particularly in high latitudes.

The second object at which we aimed was to represent the positions and the dimensions of the lands, as well as the distances of places, as much in conformity with very truth as it is possible so to do. To this we have given the greatest care, first by comparing the charts of the Castilians and of the Portuguese with each other, then by comparing them with the greater number of records of voyages both printed and in manuscript. It is from an equitable conciliation of all these documents that the dimensions and situations of the land are given here as exactly as possible, account being taken of all observations made till now which have come into our hands.

The third of our aims was to show which are the parts of the universe which were known to the ancients and to what extent they knew them, in order that the limitations of ancient geography be not unknown and that the honour which is due to past centuries be given to them. Now we hold that there are three distinct continents: the first, in the centre of which the human race was created and whence it spread, by multiplying, over all the face of the earth, the second which is called the New Indies and the third which lies in Southern parts.

Of these continents, the two last remained entirely unknown to the ancients, unless the New Indies be the land which Plato calls Atlantis. Though the first be not entirely included in Ptolemy's charts yet it was known that, throughout its periphery, it was limited by the Ocean and the greater part of it has been described by the ancients. And, with reference to Ptolemy's cartographic description, the outcome of that which is set out in the present work on the subject of the position of the Ganges is that, including therein the islands there mentioned on the eastern side, it extends as far as Thamus, a promontory of Cathay where, as maintained by Mela, is the extremity of India, the end of the Southern side and the beginning of the eastern side. On the South therefrom, in truth as far as Cape Prassum in Africa and to the Isle of Madagascar, thence to the Hippodrome of Ethiopia, it ends in the middle of the Gulf of Hesperia. The extreme of the northern coast after the Cape of the Cimbri is Livonia, but including as well the isles of Scandinavia, Albion, Ireland, the Hebrides, [[Orkney]] and Iceland, which evidently is Thule according to Pliny, Bk.2, chap.75 and Bk.4, chap.16, Solinus chap.25, and Pomponius Mela Bk.3, chap.6. The remainder of the northern boundary after crossing the Riphei Mountains is described by Pliny and on the left hand shore of the Scythian Ocean, he discusses Norway, Sweden and Finland under the names of Balthia, Basilia, Scandinavia and Eningia in Bk.4, chap.13, but he described them as islands for he was unaware of the isthmus which separates the Gulf of Finland from Grandvic. Then, following the right hand shore in Bk.6, chap.13, he places first, after the Hyperborean nations, Lytarmis, a promontory of Mount Rypheus, then the Arimpheans and most of the other nations who dwell around the Caspian Sea and its mouths, in fact he believed that it flowed into the Scythian Ocean; thence, having enumerated and described, in chap.17, the position and the peoples of the rest of the shore, he rounds Cape Tabis and arrives at the Serae by that side of the shores which faces the summer sunrise ; thereafter he reverts to India. As for the remainder of Africa from Cape Prassum as far as the Gulf of Hesperia, he recounts, in Bk.6, chap.29, that, according to the statement of King Juba, one may go round it by sea, even mentioning a few ports of call on this circumnavigation by which Mauretania is reached from India. And much earlier, as is stated by Herodotus, Bk.4, several Phenicians, by order of Necho, king of Egypt, sailed out of the Persian Gulf and, in two years, rounded Africa by sea as far as the Pillars of Hercules. And, later, a certain Eudoxus, in Mela, when he fled before King Lathyrus at Alexandria, going out of the Persian Gulf was driven as far as Gades. Hence it is certain that the whole of our continent is surrounded by water and that all its coasts were known to the ancients and it is clear that the descriptions thereof are founded on their own observations; therefrom it is manifest that those who think that the New Indies form part of the same continent as Asia are in error, as are also those who affirm that the voyages of the Portuguese in Asia extend far beyond Ptolemy's chart, for it is evident, from that which we put forward on the subject of the positions of the Ganges and of the Golden Peninsula, that they are yet very far from reaching the limit of this chart.

De presbytero Joanne Asiatico et prima dominii Tartarorum origine.

Eo tempore quo communibus copiis Syriae a Christianis obsessa et expugnata est, anno 1098, erat monarcha regionum Orientalium Asiae Coir Cham, quo mortuo sacerdos quidam et pastor Nestorianus arripuit dominium populi Naimam in terra Naiam, ac deinceps totius Orientis imperium, vocatusque est (ut erat) presbiter et rex Joannes; quo defuncto imperium sibi arrogavit frater ejus Vuth, qui in Carocoran dominabatur, et Cham se vocavit, id est dominum. Hic dum metueret succrescentes multitudinem et vires Sumongularum, hoc est aquaticorum Mongulorum, qui proprie Tartari dicebantur a Tartar flumine patrio, quanquam nec regem nec civitatem haberent sed pastores tantum essent et tributum annuum penderent, voluit illos in varias regiones dispergere quo rebellandi potentiam frangeret, verum illi cognationis et mutuae societatis jura relinquere nolentes conspiratione facta fugerunt versus aquilonem, amplam ibi et natura munitam regionem occupantes, in qua etiam negato tributo tueri se possent et libertatem vindicare.

Post paucos vero annos, cum (ut habet Gulielmus Tripolitanus) gregibus imperatoris sui Vutcham graverentur caeteri Mongali, aut alioqui forte propter ereptum Tartarorum tributum vexarentur, faber quidam ferrarius Mongalus, nomine Chinchis communis injuriae pellendae et libertatis afferendae avidus Jecmongalos ad defectionem sollicitat, Tartaros revocat, et communicatis consiliis omnium consensu rex creatur anno Domini 1187, mox eas regiones quae citra Belgian montem erant invadens facile omnes adeptus est, quoniam ut erat prudens, recte victoria utebatur, in victos minime saeviebat, sed unicuique lubenter se submittendi et militiae operam suam communicanti vitam conjuges liberos et substantiam omnem salvam esse jubebat. Deinde montem Belgian ubi in oceanum excurrit superansagressus est regnum Tenduc sedem imperialem Vutcham, quo devicto factus est monarcha orientis, vixit post Vutchamsex annis, in quibus multas provincias imperio suo adjecit. Sic imperium ad Mongalos pervenit et Tartarorum dicitur, cum quod horum occasione et opera conquisitum sit, tum maxime quod communi jure et societate viventes Mongali omnes generaliter Tartari vocarentur. Mansit autem Vutcham cum sua posteritate rex Tenduc, sed sub tributo et Tartarorum imperio.

Haec breviter collegimus ex Marco Paulo Veneto, Haitono Armeno, et Gulielmo Tripolitano Dominicano Anconensi, qui anno 1275 a Gregorio 10 missus fuit ad Tartaros, quo prima dominii Tartarici origo et sedes nota esset, ac de veritate ejus Presbiteri Joannis qui in Asia regnare creditus est hactenus, tum quoque diversum esse eum ab illo, qui usque hodie in Africa Prete Giam appellatur, constaret.

On the  Priest John of Asia and the earliest origin of the dominion of the Tartars.

At the time when Antioch in Syria was besieged and taken by the allied forces of the Christians in the year 1098 the sovereign of the eastern parts of Asia was Coir Cham. At his death a Nestorian priest and shepherd seized the dominion of the Naiman people in the country of Naiam and thereafter became the absolute master of the whole Orient and he was called, as indeed he was, Priest and King John. When he died his brother Vuth, who reigned in the Carocoran, seized the power and called himself Cham, that is Master. As he feared the multitude and the growing power of the Sumongols, that is to say the aquatic Mongols who were properly called Tartars, from the name of the river Tartar of their homeland, though they had neither king nor state and were but shepherds who paid an annual tribute, he desired to disperse them into different countries thus breaking all power of rebellion; but they, unwilling to give up their right of kinship and of mutual association, made a vow and fled to the northward where they seized a very vast country, fortified by nature, in which they would be able to defend themselves, even though they refused to pay the tribute, and thus save their liberty.

A few years later, as the other Mongols (as is related by William of Tripoli) were molested by the armies of their Emperor Vutcham, or else perchance were illtreated on account of the suppression of the tribute of the Tartars, a Mongol working blacksmith called Chinchis, anxious to remove the common affront and to obtain liberation, invited the Jecmongols to rebel and called in the Tartars; after all had, with one accord, made resolutions he was elected king by unanimous decision in the year of Our Lord II87. Shortly afterwards he invaded the countries beyond Mount Belgian and easily conquered the whole of this land for, being wise, he knew how to make full use of the victories, exercising no cruelties on the conquered and, to those who willingly gave their submission and who took service in his army, he granted their lives and allowed them to retain their wives and children and to have free enjoyment of all their goods. Thereafter, crossing Mount Belgian at the place where it meets the Ocean, he attacked the kingdom of Tenduc, the seat of the Emperor Vutcham. Having conquered him he became the monarch of the East. He lived six years after Vutcham during which he added numerous provinces to his empire. Thus the dominion passed to the Mongols and it is called the Empire of the Tartars, not only for that it was obtained because of and thanks to them, but particularly because all the Mongols who lived together under common laws were called Tartars. Vutcham and his descendants remained kings of Tenduc but paid tribute to and were under the dominion of the Tartars.

We have briefly summarized this information gathered from Marco Polo, the Venetian, Hayton the Armenian and William of Tripoli, a Dominican of Ancona who, in the year 1275, was sent by Gregory X to the Tartars in order to ascertain the primal origin and the seat of the Tartar dominion and to determine the true personality of this Prester John who was believed to be still reigning in Asia and in order clearly to show that he was not the same as he who, till today, is called Prete Giam in Africa.

On the origin of the geographical longitudes and on the magnetic pole.

Francis of Dieppe, a skilful shipmaster, asserts that movable balances, after being infected with the virtue of a magnet, point directly to the Earth's pole in the Isles of Cape Verde: Sal, Bonavista and Maio. This is closely supported by those who state that this occurs at Terceira or S. Maria (which are isles of the Azores); some believe that this is the case at the most westerly of these islands which is called Corvo. Now, since it is necessary that longitudes of places should, for good reasons, have as origin the meridian which is common to the magnet and the World, in accordance with a great number of testimonies I have drawn the prime meridian through the said Isles of Cape Verde; and as the magnet deviates elsewhere more or less from the pole, there must be a special pole towards which magnets turn in all parts of the world, therefore I have ascertained that this is in reality at the spot where I have placed it by taking into account the magnetic declination observed at Ratisbon.&lt;ref&gt;The city of [[Regensburg]] in [[Bavaria]].&lt;/ref&gt; But I have likewise calculated the position of this pole with reference to the Isle of Corvo in order that note may be taken of the extreme positions between which, according to the extreme positions of the prime meridian, this pole must lie until the observations made by seamen have provided more certain information.

As our chart cannot be extended as far as the pole, for the degrees of latitude would finally attain infinity, and as we yet have a considerable portion at the pole itself to represent, we have deemed it necessary to repeat here the extremes of our representation and to join thereto the parts remaining to be represented as far as the pole. We have employed the figure (projection: Ed) which is most apt for this part of the world and which would render the positions and aspects of the lands as they are on the sphere. In the matter of the representation, we have taken it from the Travels of James Cnoyen of Bois le Duc, who quotes certain historical facts of Arthur the Briton but who gathered the most and the best information from a priest who served the King of Norway in the year of Grace 1364. He was a descendant in the fifth degree of those whom Arthur had sent to live in these isles; he related that, in 1360, an English minor friar of Oxford,&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas of Lynn. His work, Inventio Fortunatae, now lost, still existed in 1569.&lt;/ref&gt; who was a mathematician, reached these isles and then, having departed therefrom and having pushed on further by magical arts, he had described all and measured the whole by means of an astrolabe somewhat in the form hereunder which we have reproduced from James Cnoyen. He averred that the waters of these 4 arms of the sea were drawn towards the abyss with such violence that no wind is strong enough to bring vessels back again once they have entered ; the wind there is, however, never sufficient to turn the arms of a corn mill. Exactly similar matters are related by Giraldus Carnbrensis in his book on the marvels of Ireland. Thus he writes: "Not far from the isles (Hebrides, Iceland, etc.) towards the North there is a monstrous gulf in the sea towards which from all sides the billows of the sea coming from remote parts converge and run together as though brought there by a conduit; pouring into these mysterious abysses of nature, they are as though devoured thereby and, should  it happen that a vessel pass there, it is seized and drawn away with such powerful violence of the waves that this hungry force immediately swallows it up never to appear again".

We had thought that the Niger River, with the other rivers which flow into the swamps of Libya, continues thence by the Gir River, not holding this opinion by the resemblance of the name only but also, partly, in that it is incredible that so many rivers which flow over so great distances should be finally absorbed by a single lake without being turned in some other direction, and partly also, above all, because Solinus, in chapters 30 and 33 states, without equivocation, that the waters of the Nile are thus formed and because, returning to the question in greater detail in chapter 5, relying on the authority of Carthaginian books and on the tradition of Juba, King of Mauritania, he says that the Nile has its source in a mountain of lower Mauritania near the Oceans and that its overflow is greater in Egypt when more copious melting snow or when more heavy falls of rain flow off from this source and from the mountains of Mauritania. He states, further, that at two places it disappears from view into subterranean channels, first when, having come from Lake Nilis, it grows larger from its exit from the Cesarian Grotto (which I assume to be near Mt. Usargala) and a second time before it joins the Niger River (which Ptolemy calls the Gir) which separates Africa from Ethiopia. Ptolemy says, in Bk. 4 of his Geography, chapter 6, that it loses itself yet a third time and that passing through  subterranean channels coming from the Nuba swamp it rises again in another river. Pliny, in Bk. 5, chapt. 9 gives nearly the same information as Solinus.

As the Ocean, being covered by the necessary inscriptions, cannot contain a sufficiency of compass roses and as the land, where they would have been most useful, cannot hold any, we have been constrained to add this diagram of courses to be used to obtain the respective situations of any two places with reference to each other. The latitude of the first place, the position of which with reference to the other is sought, must be noted and it must be understood to be placed in this latitude on the first meridian of the diagram. Now we have applied two compass roses to this first meridian, the upper one of which is to be used when the latitude of the first place is greater than that of the second and the lower when its latitude is less; a thread should be fixed to the centre of each of them.

If then the differences of longitude and latitude between the first and second places are known, the direction and the distance can be found. First the direction if, after the position of the second place has been fixed according to the differences of longitude and latitude, the thread be stretched from the centre of the rose so as to lie equidistant from the two places; all parallel lines drawn on the diagram are, in fact, lines of the same direction. A fixed span of a pair of compasses, laid off from each place to the thread will indicate the parallel perfectly. The distance may be found thereafter by the method set out in [[#legend12|another frame]].

If the direction of the second place be known, together with its difference either of longitude or of latitude from the first, the thread should be stretched in this direction and, the compasses being moved along it starting from the first place, the line parallel thereto can be imagined; this line, as soon as it reaches a point at the known  difference of longitude or latitude, will give the distance by the method set forth in [[#legend12|another frame]].

Should the direction and the distance of the second place with reference to the first be known, the differences of latitude and of longitude also may be found. The direction is sought which has the same inclination to the equator as that which joins the two places has to the meridian and from the centre of the directions as many degrees of the equator as there are in the distance between the two places are measured along this direction; then the meridian which is the limit of these degrees will delimit also, on the equator, the number of degrees in the difference of latitude, counting from the centre of directions. By adding these to the first place if the latitude be the lesser or by subtracting them from the same place if it be the greater, the latitude of the second place is obtained, the direction to which from the first place will give also the difference of longitude, naturally measuring on the equator a distance equal to that of the nearest meridian. God willing, we will give more and greater information on this diagram in our Geography.&lt;ref&gt;Mercator never accomplished his intention to publish a more detailed account of the use of the Organum Directio.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the approach from the Southern Continent to Java Major.

Ludovico di Varthema, in Bk.3, on India, Chapt.27, reports that on the southern side of Java Major, to the southward, there are peoples who sail with their backs to our stars of the north until they find a day of but 4 hours, i.e. to the 63rd. degree of latitude and he refers to this as coming from the mouth of his Indian pilot. As for Marco Polo, the Venetian, he saw opposite this continent some provinces and several islands and he noted the distances to Java Minor, which, according to him, is evidently neither the isle of Borneo nor some island lying to the eastward of Java Major (as most do variously think) for he says that it runs so far to the southward that neither the arctic pole nor its stars, i.e. the Little Bear, may be seen therefrom; and, in chapt.16, he states that in one of its Kingdoms, called Samara, neither of the two Bears can be seen ; therefore, considering the circumference of the island, which he states to be 2000 miles, it is certain that its northern extremity goes beyond at least the 20th degree of southern latitude. Thus we conclude, therefrom, that the Southern continent extends far to the northward and makes, with Java Major, a strait; John Mandeville, an author who, though he relates some fables, is not to be disregarded as concerns the positions of places, is of the same opinion when he  declares, in chapter 108, that the Red Sea is separated from the Eastern Ocean near Taprobana and the neighbouring regions and isles.

Aliud nobis est plaga, aliud directio distinctionis rerum causa. Plagam vocamus nostri loci ad alterum respectum secundum declinationem circuli maximi per utrumque locum ducti ab aliquo 4 punctorum cardinalium. Sic dicimus locum aliquem nobis esse boreozephyrium, id est nordwestium, quando circulus maximus a nobis per eum ductus 45 gradus in horizonte declinat a septentrionali cardine versus occidentalem. Directionem vocamus lineam ab uno loco in alium sic ductam, ut cum quibusvis meridianis aequales angulos faciat, haec perpetuo oblique incurvatur in superficie sphaerae propter meridianorum ad se invicem inclinationem, atque inde in magnis distantiis, et potissimum circa borealiores partes distantia directionalis semper major est distantia plagali, in mediocribus vero, et maxime versus aequatorem sitis, non est notablis differentia, quare cum plagales distantiae sumendae circa aequatorem non excedunt 20 gradus maximi circuli, aut in climate Hispaniae et Galliae 15 gradus: aut in partibus septentrionalibus Europae et Asiae 8 vel 10, convenienter directionalibus distantiis pro plagalibus sive rectis utemur, alioqui et harum inquirendarum ratio tradi potest, sed operosior nec admodum necessaria.

Haec distantiae inquirendae ratio per se quidem semper infallibilis est, sed in iis directionibus quae maxime ad parallelum latitudinis inclinantur incertior est circini applicatio propter nimis obliquam directionalium linearum incidentiam in parallelos, ideoque in his alter hic modus erit exactior.

A distinction must be made between plaga (orthodrome or great circle: Ed) and directio (loxodrome or rhumb line: Ed) which are two different things. We call plaga the line of sight from our position to another, which is defined by the angle between the great circle passing through the two places and any one of the four cardinal points. Thus we say that, for us, a place is "boreozephyrius", i.e. to the Northwest, when the great circle drawn through us and that place lies in the horizontal plane at 45 degrees from North towards the West. We call the line drawn from one place to another in such a way that it cuts every meridian at a constant angle, directio; this line is always recurved obliquely on the surface of the sphere on account of the inclination of the meridians with reference to each other ; thus, at great distances and particularly in more northern Regions, the "directional" distance is always greater than the "plagal" distance, but for short distances, and particularly in equatorial regions, there is no noticeable difference. Hence, when the plagal distances which are to be measured in the vicinity of the equator do not exceed 20 degrees of a great circle, or 15 degrees near Spain and France, or 8 and even 10 degrees in the northern parts of Europe and Asia, it is convenient to use directional distances instead of plagal or direct distances; another method to obtain them could be given but it is more laborious and is not absolutely necessary.

Therefore, directional distances are found thus. Let the name which should be applied (rhumb line: Ed) to the imaginary  line between the two places be considered, i.e. to which straight line drawn on the chart it is parallel ; this can be found by extending a pair of compasses from each point to one of the straight lines; next, what is the difference of latitude between these points? This may be found by transferring the distance of each point from the nearest parallel of latitude to the scale of degrees of latitude. When these two elements have been found, a line is sought, on one of the compass roses on the equator, which is inclined to the equator at the same angle as the imaginary line, which joins the two points under consideration, makes with their respective meridians; from the centre of the rose a number of degrees of the equator equal to the number of degrees in the difference of the latitudes is measured. The compasses are then opened from the last of these degrees and the nearest meridian and are moved with one point remaining on this meridian and the other accompanying it at a constant distance until it reaches the line which has the required inclination. This point of the compasses is then held in place and the other,
which had moved on the meridian, is extended to the centre of the rose. With this extension the compasses are transferred to the equator and the number of degrees between the points gives the directional distance  between the places considered, the number of degrees being multiplied by 15 if German miles are required, by 60 if they be Italian miles and by 20 if they be the common French or Spanish miles.

This method for obtaining the distance is indeed always infallible in principle, but, when the directions are greatly inclined to the parallels of latitude, the point of application of the compasses is less determinate on account of the too oblique incidence of the lines of the rose to the parallels ; then the following method is more accurate. With the compasses set at the difference of latitude between the places in question, the number of degrees contained therein being noted, the compasses are run from one place to the other by such number of  revolutions as the distance between the two places permits; the distance which may remain and which will be less than the span set on the compasses, is measured by closing them to it and reading this length on the scale of degrees between the two latitudes; this intercepted number of degrees is noted and is added to the number of degrees in all the revolutions of the compasses, thus obtaining a single total by means of which the number of miles in the distance sought may be found by multiplying, as indicated above.

In 1493, when the Spaniards and the Portuguese were in ardent competition in long sea voyages, Pope Alexander fixed, as the limit to determine the rights of navigation and of conquest of the two parties, the meridian circle distant by 100 leagues from any of the Cape Verd Islands or from those known as the Azores, attributing the western side to the Spaniards and the eastern side to the Portuguese. The two parties having rejected this limit on account of altercations which arose in 1524, the meridian lying 370 leagues to the westward of the isle of San Antonio, the most westerly of the Gorgades, was taken as the common boundary.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] and [[Treaty of Zaragoza]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ea quae longa experientia discuntur si ad perfectam veritatis cognitionem progredi non autem falsitate obscurari debeant sic instituenda sunt, ut castigatis quae per manifestas rationes falsa sunt, probabilia retineantur, donec experientiae et ratiocinationes omnes inter se consentaneae res ipsas in sua veritate ob oculos ponant, talis est geographia, quam, si volumus veterum inventa temere quavis occasione transponere, commutare aut invertere, non modo non perficiemus, sed pro unius erroris emendatione centum veritates depravabimus et confusissimam tandem terrarum et nominum congeriem faciemus, in qua nec regiones suis locis nec nomina suis regionibus reponantur, quale quid hodie in Indiae descriptione sit a geographis, dum nimis absurde Gangem celebratissimum fluvium occidentalior faciunt Cincapura promontorio et Taprobana, qui veteribus multo fuit orientaliter, atque universam deinceps Indiae descriptionem, quae apud Ptolomeum est, invertunt et confundunt, nihil illi ultra dictum promontorium concedentes, quod in primis nobis refellendum est, quo Ptolomeo sua stet {{Not a typo|autoritas}} et geographica veritas eruatur, quae non minus vera nomina quam veros locorum situs postulat. Ac primum constat eam descriptionem non obiter a Ptolomeo congestam esse, sed inde usque ab Alexandro Magno multorum terra marique profectionibus, multorum observationibus hanc figuram accepisse, et emendatius collectam a Marino, integritatique a Ptolomeo restitutam, quare cum tot saeculis totque artificibus elaborata sit, non est {{Not a typo|possibile}} tam enormiter a vero recedere, ut tam longi littoris transpositione fallat, neque enim poterat tantarum littoris partium, quantae sunt a Comara promontorio ad Taprobanam adjacensque ei promontorium, ac dehinc ad Gangem et Auream, neque tam frequentatarum (ut copiosa locorum inscriptio arguit) consequentia ignorari, ut quae prior erat posterior poneretur, et Ganges longo intervallo Taprobanam sequeretur, qui (ut nostri volunt) multo antecedere debebat. In directionum cursu falli poterant veteres propter navigandi artem adhuc imperfectam, et quod neglectis fere directionibus littora soleant legi. In articularium itidem locorum transpositione errare poterant, at sane in hujusmodi quam diximus consequentia nequaquam. Arrianus gravis {{Not a typo|autor}} in Periplo veritatis nobis judex est, cui ab Indo in meridiem est Comara unde juxta consequentiam littorum per Colchos, Camaram Poducam et Sopatmam pervenit in Taprobanam et adjacentem illi regionem Azaniam, ubi nunc Malacha est nostris, et Ptolomeo, Mesolus fluvius, Arrino item Mazalia regio; postea per Desarenam Cirradas, Bargisos, Hippoprosopos demum ad Gangem fluvium et emporium pertingit. Ad haec via regia stadiorum 20 000, quae est ab Indo ad Gangem et Palibotram apud Strabonem lib.15 non alio loco Gangem admittet, quam quo nos eum cum Ptolomeo posuimus. Non enim intimus recessus Bengalici sinus, quo hodie veterum Gangem transferunt, eousque elongari ab Indo potest servatis directionibus et earum dimensionibus, ut propositam distantiam Palibotra Gangi imposita servet, simul perpenso quod Ganges a Palibotra orientem versus mare petat. Jam si consideremus 38 dierum iter quod Nicolaus de Conti Venetus confecit ab intimo inu Bengalico, et Avam fluvium, ad quem pervenit, multo majorem Guenga Bengalico, non inepte judicabimus eum ad maximum Indiae fluminum celebratissimumque verteribus Gangem pervenisse, quanquam alio forte ibi nomine vocatum, Avam quoque urbem eidem fluvio adjacentem credibile erit Palibotram esse cum ob magnitudinem, ut quae 15 miliarium ambitu patet, tum ob convenientem ab ostiis distantiam, 17 enim diebus enavigavit Nicolaus, cum 6000 stadiorum ponat Strabo. Et sane cum eo loco que nos signavimus situm fontes Guengae Bengalici, idemque quem posuimus ipsius decursus, ut Joannem de Barros testem habemus, quid absurdius dici poterat quam hunc esse veterum illum Gangem, cujus fontes constat iisdem montibus quibus Indum ortos, et 280 mil:pass: tantum a Zaradro orientalissimo Indum augentium fluvio Plinio test distare, tum etiam magna parte in meridiem ferri? Quare cum neque fontes Guengae, neque situs, neque longitudo ipsius veterum descriptioni conveniat, hunc esse veterum Gangem negamus, tametsi nomen ejus referre videatur. Quinimo nec ipsi qui ejus opinionis autores fuerunt suae sententiae confidenter stare videntur, cum alterum finxerint Gangem iisdem cum Guenga ostiis se in Bengalicum sinum exonerantem, ipsa nimirum dislocatione eos redarguente. Adde quod oppida aliquot et Moin sive Mien aut Mein regnum huic fluvio, quem nos Gangem esse defendimus, debita ad suum quoque fictitium Gangem transtulerint, quo perspicue intelligi datur verum illlum et veterum Gangem alibi quam in sinu Bengalico quaerendum esse. Praeter solidas quoque istas rationes vel figura ipsa littorum et nomina passim inscripta veritatem ostendere poterant, Comari enim promontorium et nostri cum Ptolomeo atque Arriano ponunt, tum cabo de Colle quid aluid sonat quam Collaicum Ptolomei aut Colchicum Arriani? Quid consonantius quam Jameri et Chaberis sive Camara, Pogu vel Pegu et Poduca, Tavay et Tava, Malanga et Malaca, Cantan et Gange oppidum cum fluvio maximo qualem veteres quoque Gangem testantur? Denique, si hic non est Ganges ubi posuimus, quo referentur tot insulae in sinu Gangetico a Ptolomeo positae, cum in Bengalico sinu non reperiantur? Tenemus ergo Cantan maximum fluvium esse Gangem a veteribus celebratum, et Auream ess non quae nunc Malaca est, sed Japan insulam, ut ex Arriano et Mela liquet, tametsi peninsulam faciat Ptolomeus, apud quem et Sabana emporium hodiernum insulae nomen videtur obtinere, Marcus Paulus Venetus lib : 3. cap : 2. dicit eam convenienter antiquo nomini suo auro abundantissimam esse. Praeterea insulam Burneo esse quae Ptolomeo Bonae fortunae, Celebes, Ambon et Gilolo esse quae Sindae appellantur, Mindanao cum vicinis 4 majoribus Barussas vocari refellere non possumus. Nomina item quaedam in recentioribus tabulis invenio quae Mangi et Cathaium regna Ptolomeo cognita fuisse manifeste doceant, et ad sinum Magnum quem Plinius Chrysen vocat pertinere, ut sunt in Mangi regno Pagrasa, Done, Caracaran, Agonara, Tartaho, in Cathaio autem Aspicia et Brema, quibus apud Ptolomaeum respondent Pagrasa, Daona, Lariagara, Aganagara, Coracha, Aspithara, Bramma, ut dubium nullum sit Gangem Taprobana orientaliorem esse, recteque deinceps Chrysen, insulam et sinum Magnum sequi, ultra quae [[Cattigara]] [[Sinae|Sinarum]] statio postremus Ptolomaicae descriptionis terminus orientalem nostrae continentis extremitatem possidere, et in regnum, quod hodie Tenduch vocatur, incidere videtur.

On the true positions of the Ganges and the Golden Chersonese.

That which long experience teaches, in order to advance with the object of a  perfect knowledge of truth and not to be blinded by error, should be so established that, after discarding all which obvious reasons reveal to be false, that which is probable is retained until, every test and every reasoning being in agreement, the facts themselves in their very truth are placed before the eyes. It is so in geography. Should we, at the first incidental occasion, transpose, modify or discard the discoveries of the ancients, not only will we not improve but, by correcting a single error we will alter a hundred truths and, in the end, we will have an extremely confused mass of lands and names in which neither the parts will appear under their true names nor the names on their proper parts. Somewhat in this fashion has been done today by geographers in the map of India, in that, most absurdly, they place this very celebrated River Ganges further west than the promontory of Singapore and than Taprobana,&lt;ref&gt;Mercator takes this to be the Isle of Sumatra, on the equator 135E. The position of [[Taprobana]] was highly contentious in the sixteenth century. See [http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~lkawgw/slm-taprobane.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; though, according to the ancients, it lay much further to the eastward; then, also, they upset and confound the whole map of India, as given by Ptolemy, by not allotting to it anything beyond the said promontory. But we must most strongly rebut this opinion in order that Ptolemy's authority be not shaken and that the geographical truth be made manifest, which truth requires no less accuracy in the names than in the positions of places. And it is most clearly evident that the representation was not compiled in a superficial manner by Ptolemy but that it received the form which has been given to it since the time of Alexander the Great thanks to the expeditions of numerous travellers by land and sea and to many observations and that it had been corrected by Marinus and entirely restored by Ptolemy. Hence, since it is the result of the labour of so many centuries and so many workers, it is impossible that it should so hugely vary from the truth and that it should be false by the displacement of a coast of such great extent. And verily the succession could not be unknown of parts of the shore, on the one hand, as considerable as those which extend from Comara Promontory as far as Taprobana, and the adjacent headland and thence as far as the Ganges and the [[Golden Chersonese]] and, on the other hand, so greatly frequented (as is proved by the abundance of the names of places inscribed thereon), to the extent that that which is before could be placed after and that the Ganges, which (according to these men) should come a long way before, should have been placed a great distance after Taprobana. In laying down directions the ancients might well be wrong on account of the imperfection which then vitiated the art of navigation and because, direction being almost disregarded, they were accustomed to hug the shores. Likewise they might err by the transposition of particular places but, of a truth, they could not mistake the order of the positions of which we have spoken. [[Arrian]], who was a thorough writer, clearly shows us the truth in his [[Periplus]].&lt;ref&gt;The famous periplus of Arrian describes the Black Sea. Ptolemy here may be referring to the [[Anabasis Alexandri]].  This requires clarification.&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, starting from the Indus, Comara is to the Southward, thence, taking the coasts in succession by Colchos, Camara, Poduca and Sopatma, he arrives at Taprobana and in the adjacent region of Azania, which for us is now Malacca, for Ptolemy the river Mesclus and for Arrian the region of Mazalia; hence by Desarena, the Cirrades, the Bargises and the Hippoprosopes finally he reaches the river and the emporium of Ganges. And, further, the Royal Road of 20,000 stadia, which runs from the Indus to the Ganges and Palibotra, according to Strabo, Bk. 15, would not permit the Ganges to be placed elsewhere than where we, with Ptolemy, have put it. In fact, the most deeply indented part of the Bay of Bengal, to which the old Ganges is transferred today, cannot be sufficiently distant from the Indus, if the directions and their dimensions be maintained, for Palibotra, situated on the Ganges, to be at the stated distance, taking into consideration at the same time that the Ganges, from Palibotra, flows towards the sea in an Easterly direction. And again, if we consider the journey of 38 days, which the Venetian Nicolas de Conti made from the head of the Bay of Bengal, and the Ava River, at which he arrived, which was much greater than the Guenga of Bengal, we may deem with sufficient reason that be reached the Ganges, the greatest of the rivers of India and that which was best known to the ancients, even though, there, it were known by another name; it is even likely that the city of Ava, nigh unto this river, may be Palibotra, not only on account of its greatness - for the city has a compass of 15 miles – but also for its distance from the mouth, which is in close accord; actually Nicolas sailed for 17 days thereon to reach the sea whilst Strabo speaks of a distance of 6000 stadia. And, truly, since the sources of the Guenga of Bengal are in the parts where we have placed them and as its course is that which we show, as witnesses Jodo de Barros, what more absurd could be said than that this be the Ganges of the ancients, of which it is shown that the sources are in the same mountains as those of the Indus and that it is but 280 paces distant from the River Zaradrus, the most easterly of the tributaries of the Indus according to the testimony of Pliny, and, yet again, that, over a large part of its course, it runs to the southward. Therefore, since neither the sources of the Guenga, nor its position, nor its length are in accord with the descriptions of the ancients, we deny that this is the Ganges of the ancients though its name may appear to refer thereto. Still more, those who were the authors of this opinion do not seem to maintain their position with confidence when they imagined another Ganges falling into the Bay of Bengal by the same mouth as the Guenga, this displacement alone being sufficient to refute their argument. If to this be added that they have transferred several towns and the kingdom of Moin or Mien, or Mein, which are connected with this river which we hold to be the Ganges, to their fictitious Ganges, it will be clearly understood that this true Ganges, which is also the Ganges of the ancients, must be sought elsewhere than in the Bay of  Bengal. Besides these valid reasons, the shapes of the coasts themselves and the names which appear nearly everywhere would show the truth. Our geographers, in fact, place the headland of Comara as do Ptolemy and Arrian; besides, has not the name Cabo de Colle the same sound as the Collaicum of Ptolemy or the Colchicum of Arrian? Is there anything which is nearer than Jameri and Chaberis or Camara, Pogu or Pegu and Poduca, Tavay and Tava, Malanga and Mallacca, Cantan and the town of Gange with the very great river which the ancients also attest to be the Ganges? Finally, if the Ganges be not there where we have placed it, to whither shall so many isles placed by Ptolemy in the Gangetic Gulf be referred, since they are not in the Bay of Bengal? We maintain therefore that the very great river Cantan is the celebrated Ganges of the ancients and that the Golden Chersonese is not that which is now Malacca but the isle of Japan, as is clearly evident from the texts of Arrian and of Mela, though Ptolemy makes it a peninsula, but in Ptolemy the present emporium of Sabana seems also to be called an island. Marco Polo, of Venice, says, in Bk.3, chapt.2, that,  consistently with its ancient name, it abounds greatly in gold.&lt;ref&gt;Mercator seems to be contradicting himself at this point. Earlier in this Legend he accepts Ptolemy’s identification of the Golden Chersones as the Malaya Peninsula but finally identifies it with Japan.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides we are obliged to admit that the island of Borneo is that which Ptolemy calls the isle of Good Fortune, that Celebes, Ambon and Gilolo are those which are called Sindes and that Mindanao and the neighbouring 4 great islands are called the Barusses. Likewise I find, on some fairly recent charts, certain names which manifestly indicate that Ptolemy knew of the kingdoms of Mangi and Cathay and that they touch on the [[Sinus Magnus|Great Gulf]] which Pliny calls [[Golden Chersonese|Chryse]], such as, in the kingdom of Mangi, Pagrasa, Done, Caracaran, Agonara, and Tartaho, and in the kingdom of Cathay Aspicia and Brema, to which, in Ptolemy, Pagrasa, Daona, Lariagara, Aganagara, Cortacha, Aspithara and Bramma correspond, thus there is no doubt but that the Ganges lies more to the eastward than Taprobana and that, thereafter, it flows straight towards the [[isle of Chryse]] and the Sinus Magnus beyond which [[Cattigara]], a station of the [[Sinae]], the extreme limit of the Ptolomaean chart, appears to lie at the extremity of our continent and to coincide with the kingdom now called Tenduch.

Mesopredators often vary in ecosystems depending on the food web.

== The Mesopredator Release Effect==
When populations of [[apex predator]]s decrease, populations of mesopredators often increase. This is the [[mesopredator release effect]]. "Mesopredator outbreaks often lead to declining prey populations, sometimes destabilizing communities and driving local extinctions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; When apex predators are removed from the ecosystem, this gives the mesopredator have less competition and conflict. They are able to catch more prey and have fewer causes of death. Often times mesopredators can take over the role as apex predators. This happens when new species are introduced into an ecosystem or when species leave or are killed off of an ecosystem. When this happens, and the new apex predator or former mesopredator, becomes the new species on top of the food chain, it is important to remember that they are not ecologically identical to the former apex predator, and is likely a smaller species having different effects on the structure and stability of the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mesopredators that become the new apex predators are the species that benefit from this mesopredator release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apex predators reduce mesopredator populations, and change mesopredator behaviors and habitat choices, by preying on and intimidating mesopredators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ritchie|first=Euan G.|last2=Johnson|first2=Christopher N.|date=2009-09-01|title=Predator interactions, mesopredator release and biodiversity conservation|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01347.x/abstract|journal=Ecology Letters|language=en|volume=12|issue=9|pages=982–998|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01347.x|issn=1461-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can occur in any ecosystem with any type of relationship between predator and prey. However, in the case of the relationship between apex predator and mesopredator, it could mean that the apex predator causes the mesopredator to leave the ecosystem, again, creating room for a new species to become mesopredator. 

Mesopredator outbreaks are increasing over the last little while in fragmented habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is caused by a few reasons. A main cause is by the disappearance of apex species within the habitat. Apex species are usually larger animals who require a bigger area and will often leave if the habitat is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the apex predator leaves the ecosystem, the former mesopredator will become the new apex predator, and a new species becomes the mesopredator. Another cause created also created by the apex predators being larger animals is that they will often have more encounters with humans, leaving them more susceptible to harmful conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; These harmful conflicts can either cause the apex predator to leave the ecosystem in fear of danger, or if the situation is extreme enough, the humans will have killed off the apex predator from their habitat. Again, this is another example showing how the role of mesopredator and apex predator is constantly changing. Another reason why mesopredator outbreaks are becoming more popular is because of certain resources being added in fragmented areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resources such as pet food, trash, crop, and crop pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; These resources often appear when development is occurring on land near the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prugh|first=Laura R.|last2=Stoner|first2=Chantal J.|last3=Epps|first3=Clinton W.|last4=Bean|first4=William T.|last5=Ripple|first5=William J.|last6=Laliberte|first6=Andrea S.|last7=Brashares|first7=Justin S.|date=2009-10-01|title=The Rise of the Mesopredator|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|journal=BioScience|volume=59|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.9.9|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scenario is the most ideal for mesopredator outbreaks to occur.

The layers are to scale. From Earth's surface to the top of the stratosphere (50km) is just under 1% of Earth's radius.]]

The '''mesosphere''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|s|oʊ|s|f|ɪər}}; from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''mesos'' "middle" ) is the layer of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] that is directly above the [[stratosphere]] and directly below the [[thermosphere]]. In the mesosphere, [[temperature]] decreases as the [[altitude]] increases. This characteristic is used to define its limits: it begins at the top of the stratosphere (sometimes called the [[stratopause]]), and ends at the [[mesopause]], which is the coldest part of Earth's atmosphere with temperatures below {{convert|-143|C|F K}}. The exact upper and lower boundaries of the mesosphere vary with latitude and with season (higher in winter and at the tropics, lower in summer and at the poles), but the lower boundary is usually located at heights from {{convert|50|to|65|km|ft mi}} above the Earth's surface and the upper boundary (mesopause) is usually around {{convert|85|to|100|km|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/environment/atmosphere/middle-atmosphere|title=Middle atmosphere|website=www.antarctica.gov.au|language=en-au|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Venkat Ratnam|first=M.|last2=Patra|first2=A.

The stratosphere, mesosphere and lowest part of the thermosphere are collectively referred to as the "middle atmosphere",{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} which spans heights from approximately {{convert|10|km|foot mi}} to {{convert|100|km|miles ft}}. The [[mesopause]], at an altitude of {{convert|80|-|90|km|mi|abbr=on}},{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} separates the mesosphere from the [[thermosphere]]&amp;mdash;the second-outermost layer of the Earth's atmosphere. This is also around the same altitude as the [[turbopause]], below which different chemical species are well mixed due to turbulent eddies. Above this level the atmosphere becomes non-uniform; the [[scale height]]s of different chemical species differ by their [[molecular mass]]es.

The term '''near space''' is also sometimes used.  This term does not have a technical definition, but typically refers the region of the atmosphere up to 100&amp;nbsp;km (65,000 and 328,000 feet), roughly between the [[Armstrong limit]] (above which humans need a [[pressure suit]] to survive) up to the [[Kármán line]] where [[astrodynamics]] must take over from aerodynamics in order to achieve flight. The definition of near space can vary depending on the source, but in general near space comprises the altitudes above where commercial [[airliner]]s fly but below orbiting [[satellite]]s. Some sources distinguish between the terms "near space" and "upper atmosphere," so that only the layers closest to the [[Karman line]] are called near space.

==Temperature==
Within the mesosphere, [[temperature]] decreases with increasing [[height]], due to decreasing absorption of solar radiation by the rarefied atmosphere and increasing cooling by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[radiative emission]]. The top of the mesosphere, called the [[mesopause]], is the coldest part of Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=mesosphere|file=M03855}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperatures in the upper mesosphere fall as low as {{convert|-101|C|K F|sigfig=3}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Mesosphere (Wayback Machine Archive)|url=http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/atmosphere/older/mesosphere.html|accessdate=14 November 2011|publisher=Atmosphere, Climate &amp; Environment Information ProgGFKDamme (UK [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]])|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701030705/http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/atmosphere/older/mesosphere.html|archivedate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; varying according to [[latitude]] and [[season]].

==Dynamic features==
The main dynamic features in this region are strong zonal (East-West) winds, [[atmospheric tide]]s, internal atmospheric gravity waves (commonly called "[[gravity waves]]"), and [[planetary wave]]s. Most of these tides and waves start in the [[troposphere]] and lower [[stratosphere]], and propagate to the mesosphere. In the mesosphere, gravity-wave amplitudes can become so large that the waves become unstable and dissipate. This dissipation deposits momentum into the mesosphere and largely drives global circulation.

[[Noctilucent cloud]]s are located in the mesosphere. The upper mesosphere is also the region of the [[ionosphere]] known as the ''D layer''. The D layer is only present during the day when some [[ionization]] occurs with [[nitric oxide]] being ionized by [[Lyman series]]-alpha hydrogen radiation. The ionization is so weak that when night falls, and the source of ionization is removed, the free electron and ion form back into a neutral molecule. The mesosphere has been called the "ignorosphere" because it is poorly studied relative to the stratosphere (which can be accessed with high-altitude balloons) and the thermosphere (in which satellites can orbit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-02-06-atmosphere_x.htm|title=Upper atmosphere may hold clues in Columbia mystery|date=6 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{convert|5|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} deep [[sodium layer]] is located between {{convert|80|-|105|km|abbr=on|mi ft}}. Made of unbound, non-ionized atoms of sodium, the sodium layer radiates weakly to contribute to the [[airglow]]. The sodium has an average concentration of 400,000 atoms per cubic centimetre. This band is regularly replenished by sodium [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimating]] from incoming meteors. Astronomers have begun utilizing this sodium band to create "guide stars" as part of the [[adaptive optics|adaptive optical correction process]] used to produce ultra-sharp ground-based observations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laserfocusworld.com/articles/print/volume-52/issue-07/features/adaptive-optics-eso-s-very-large-telescope-sees-four-times-first-laser-light.html Martin Enderlein et al., ''ESO's Very Large Telescope sees four times first light'', Laser Focus World, July 2016, pp. 22-24]&lt;/ref&gt; Other metal layers, e.g. iron and potassium, exist in the upper mesosphere/lower thermosphere region as well.

Millions of [[meteor]]s enter the Earth's atmosphere, averaging 40 tons per year.&lt;ref&gt;Leinert C.; Gruen E. (1990). "Interplanetary Dust". Physics and Chemistry in Space (R. Schwenn and E. Marsch eds.). Springer-Verlag. pp. 204-275&lt;/ref&gt; The ablated material, called meteoric smoke, is thought to serve as condensation nuclei for [[noctilucent clouds]].

The mesosphere lies above altitude records for [[aircraft]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=2825|title=Powered Aeroplanes World Records|publisher=[[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]]|accessdate=31 August 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911215233/http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=2825|archivedate=11 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while only the lowest few kilometers are accessible to [[balloons]], for which the altitude record is 53.0&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/e/special/2003/yamagami/03.shtml|title=Research on Balloon to Float over 50km Altitude|publisher=Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, [[JAXA]]|accessdate=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the mesosphere is below the minimum altitude for [[Earth orbit|orbital]] [[spacecraft]] due to high atmospheric drag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iadc-online.org/Documents/IADC-2002-01,%20IADC%20Space%20Debris%20Guidelines,%20Revision%201.pdf|format=PDF|title=IADC Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines|publisher=[[Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee]]|date=15 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/NSS1740_14/nss1740_14-1995.pdf |format=PDF |title=NASA Safety Standard 1740.14, Guidelines and Assessment Procedures for Limiting Orbital Debris |publisher=Office of Safety and Mission Assurance |date=1 August 1995 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215143933/http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/NSS1740_14/nss1740_14-1995.pdf |archivedate=15 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nccur.lib.nccu.edu.tw/handle/140.119/51133&lt;!-- former link: http://www.fai.org/astronautics/100km.asp--&gt;|title=100 km Altitude Boundary for Astronautics|publisher=Fédération Aéronautique Internationale}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has only been accessed through the use of [[Sounding Rocket|sounding rockets]], which are only capable of taking mesospheric measurements for a few minutes per mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=24 July 2006|url=http://rscience.gsfc.nasa.gov/srrov.html|title=NASA Sounding Rocket Program Overview|work=NASA Sounding Rocket Program|publisher=NASA|accessdate=10 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it is the least-understood part of the atmosphere, resulting in the humorous moniker ''ignorosphere''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=1 September 2016|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2016/oct/destination-ignorosphere|title=Reusable Rockets Set to Explore the 'Ignorosphere'|publisher=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover Magazine]]|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of [[red sprite]]s and [[blue jet]]s (electrical discharges or [[lightning]] within the lower mesosphere), [[noctilucent cloud]]s, and density shears within this poorly understood layer are of current scientific interest.

Near space was first explored in the 1930s. The early flights flew to the edge of space without computers, spacesuits, and with only crude life support systems. Notable people who flew in near space were [[Jean Piccard]] and his wife Jeannette, on the nearcraft [[The Century of Progress]]. Later exploration was mainly carried out by unmanned craft, although there have been skydiving attempts made from high-altitude balloons.

The area is of interest for military surveillance purposes, scientific study, as well as to commercial interests for communications, and tourism. Craft that fly in near space include [[high-altitude balloon]]s, [[non-rigid airship]]s, [[rockoon]]s, [[sounding rocket]]s, and the [[Lockheed U-2]] aircraft. The region has been of interest to space travel. Early attempts used a craft known as a [[rockoon]] to reach extreme altitudes and orbit. These are still used today for [[sounding rockets]].

[[High-altitude platform station]]s have been proposed for applications such as communications relays. There has been a resurgence of interest in near space to launch manned spacecraft by man. Groups like [[ARCASPACE]], as well as the [[da Vinci Project]] are planning on launching manned suborbital space vehicles from high-altitude balloons. [[JP Aerospace]] has a proposal for a [[spaceport]] in near space, as part of their [[Airship to Orbit]] program.

===High-altitude balloons===

Near space has long been used for scientific ballooning, for applications such as [[Submillimetre astronomy#Submillimetre astronomy from near-space|submillimetre astronomy]]. High-altitude balloons are often flown by students and by amateur groups to altitudes on the order of {{convert|100000|ft|abbr=on}}, for both scientific and educational purposes.&lt;ref&gt;GSBC, [http://community.balloonchallenge.org/t/what-is-a-high-altitude-balloon-hab/678 What is a High Altitude Balloon] (accessed August 8, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UKHAS, [https://ukhas.org.uk/general:beginners_guide_to_high_altitude_ballooning A Beginners Guide to High Altitude Ballooning] (accessed August 8, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DIY Space Exploration, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130901013526/http://www.diyspaceexploration.com/introduction-to-high-altitude-balloons/ Introduction to High Altitude Balloons] (accessed August 8, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mount St. Helens''' or '''Louwala-Clough''' (known as '''Lawetlat'la''' to the indigenous [[Cowlitz people]], and '''Loowit''' to the [[Klickitat people|Klickitat]]) is an active [[stratovolcano]] located in [[Skamania County, Washington]], in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of the United States. It is {{Convert|50|mi|km}} northeast of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oregon and {{Convert|96|mi|km}} south of [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Mount St.&amp;nbsp;Helens takes its English name from the British diplomat [[Alleyne Fitzherbert, 1st Baron St Helens|Lord St&amp;nbsp;Helens]], a friend of explorer [[George Vancouver]] who made a survey of the area in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="gnis"/&gt; The volcano is located in the [[Cascade Range]] and is part of the [[Cascade Volcanoes|Cascade Volcanic Arc]], a segment of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]] that includes over 160 active volcanoes. This volcano is well known for its [[volcanic ash|ash]] explosions and [[pyroclastic flow]]s.

Mount St. Helens is most notorious for [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|its major 1980 eruption]], the deadliest and most economically destructive volcanic event in the history of the United States.&lt;ref name="USDA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/|publisher=[[USDA Forest Service]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123065550/http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/ |archivedate=2006-11-23 |title=Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty-seven people were killed; 250 homes, 47 bridges, {{Convert|15|mi|km}} of railways, and {{Convert|185|mi|km}} of highway were destroyed. A massive [[debris avalanche]] triggered by an earthquake measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale caused an eruption&lt;ref name="USGSFrom1980"/&gt; that reduced the elevation of the mountain's summit from {{Convert|9677|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|8363|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, leaving a {{Convert|1|mi|km}} wide horseshoe-shaped crater.&lt;ref name="USDATeacherCorner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/education/teachers-corner/library/volcanic-eruption-summary.shtml|publisher=USDA Forest Service |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529034823/http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/education/teachers-corner/library/volcanic-eruption-summary.shtml |archivedate=2009-05-29|title=May 18, 1980 Eruption of Mount St. Helens}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debris avalanche was up to {{Convert|0.7|mi3|km3|1}} in volume. The [[Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument]] was created to preserve the volcano and allow for the eruption's aftermath to be scientifically studied.

As with most other volcanoes in the Cascade Range, Mount St.&amp;nbsp;Helens is a large eruptive cone consisting of [[lava]] rock interlayered with ash, [[pumice]], and other deposits. The mountain includes layers of [[basalt]] and [[andesite]] through which several [[Lava dome|domes]] of [[dacite]] lava have erupted. The largest of the dacite domes formed the previous summit, and off its northern flank sat the smaller Goat Rocks dome. Both were destroyed in the 1980 eruption.

==Geographic setting and description==

===General===
[[File:St Helens and nearby area from space.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Landscape with a large open volcano|A view of St.&amp;nbsp;Helens and the nearby area from space]]
[[File:Mount St. Helens, one day before the devastating eruption.jpg|thumb|alt=A large conical volcano.|Mount St. Helens the day before the 1980 eruption, which removed much of the northern face of the mountain, leaving a large [[Volcanic crater|crater]]]]
[[File:PIA06668 Mount Saint Helens.jpg|thumb|3-D perspective view of Mount St. Helens]]
Mount St. Helens is {{Convert|34|mi|km}} west of [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]], in the western part of the Cascade Range. These "sister and brother" volcanic mountains are approximately {{Convert|50|mi|km|-1}} from [[Mount Rainier]], the highest of Cascade volcanoes. [[Mount Hood]], the nearest major volcanic peak in [[Oregon]], is {{Convert|60|mi|km|-1}} southeast of Mount St.&amp;nbsp;Helens.

Mount St. Helens is geologically young compared with the other major Cascade volcanoes. It formed only within the past 40,000 years, and the pre-1980 summit cone began rising about 2,200 years ago.{{sfn|Mullineaux|Crandell|1981|p=3}} The volcano is considered the most active in the Cascades within the [[Holocene]] epoch (the last 10,000 or so years).&lt;ref name="USGS-Description"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/description_msh.html|title=Description of Mount St. Helens|publisher=USGS|accessdate=2006-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1980 eruption, Mount St. Helens was the fifth-highest peak in Washington. It stood out prominently from surrounding hills because of the symmetry and extensive snow and ice cover of the pre-1980 summit cone, earning it the nickname "[[Mount Fuji|Fuji-san]] of America".{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=201}} The peak rose more than {{Convert|5000|ft|m|-2}} above its base, where the lower flanks merge with adjacent ridges. The mountain is {{Convert|6|mi|km}} across at its base, which is at an elevation of {{Convert|4400|ft|m|-2}} on the northeastern side and {{Convert|4000|ft|m|-2}} elsewhere. At the pre-eruption [[tree line]], the width of the cone was {{Convert|4|mi|km}}.

[[File:Mtsthelens_7242007.jpg|thumb|View of Mt. St. Helens from a commercial airliner, July 2007]]
[[Stream]]s that originate on the volcano enter three main river systems: the [[Toutle River]] on the north and northwest, the [[Kalama River]] on the west, and the [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis River]] on the south and east. The streams are fed by abundant rain and snow. The average annual rainfall is {{Convert|140|in|mm|-2}}, and the snow pack on the mountain's upper slopes can reach {{Convert|16|ft|m|1}}.&lt;ref name="Tilling1990"/&gt; The Lewis River is impounded by three [[dam]]s for [[hydroelectric power]] generation. The southern and eastern sides of the volcano drain into an upstream impoundment, the [[Swift Reservoir]], which is directly south of the volcano's peak.
[[File:Mtsthelens oli 2015110 lrg.jpg|thumb|April 30, 2015 Mount St. Helens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mount St. Helens at 35 |date=May 18, 2015 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/mount-st-helens-at-35 |publisher=NASA |accessdate =2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Although Mount St. Helens is in Skamania County, Washington, access routes to the mountain run through [[Cowlitz County, Washington|Cowlitz County]] to the west and [[Lewis County, Washington|Lewis County]] to the north. [[Washington State Route 504|State Route 504]], locally known as the [[Spirit Lake Memorial Highway]], connects with [[Interstate 5 (Washington)|Interstate&amp;nbsp;5]] at Exit 49, {{Convert|34|mi|km}} to the west of the mountain. That north–south highway skirts the low-lying cities of [[Castle Rock, Washington|Castle Rock]], [[Longview, Washington|Longview]] and [[Kelso, Washington|Kelso]] along the [[Cowlitz River]], and passes through the [[Vancouver, Washington]]–[[Portland, Oregon]] [[metropolitan area]] less than {{Convert|50|mi|km|-1}} to the southwest. The community nearest the volcano is [[Cougar, Washington|Cougar]], Washington, in the Lewis River valley {{Convert|11|mi|km}} south-southwest of the peak. [[Gifford Pinchot National Forest]] surrounds Mount St.&amp;nbsp;Helens.

===Crater Glacier and other new rock glaciers===
[[File:Summit rim of Mount St. Helens.ogv|thumb|Summit rim of Mount St.&amp;nbsp;Helens]]
{{Main|Crater Glacier}}
During the winter of 1980–1981, a new [[glacier]] appeared. Now officially named [[Crater Glacier]], it was formerly known as the Tulutson Glacier. Shadowed by the crater walls and fed by heavy snowfall and repeated snow avalanches, it grew rapidly ({{Convert|14|ft|m}} per year in thickness). By 2004, it covered about {{Convert|0.36|sqmi|km2|2}}, and was divided by the dome into a western and eastern lobe. Typically, by late summer, the glacier looks dark from rockfall from the crater walls and ash from eruptions. As of 2006, the ice had an average thickness of {{Convert|300|ft|m|-2}} and a maximum of {{Convert|650|ft|m|-2}}, nearly as deep as the much older and larger [[Carbon Glacier]] of Mount Rainier. The ice is all post–1980, making the glacier very young geologically. However, the volume of the new glacier is about the same as all the pre–1980 glaciers combined.&lt;ref name="Brugman81"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Brugman | first1 = Melinda M. | author2 = [[Austin Post]] | title = USGS Circular 850-D: Effects of Volcanism on the Glaciers of Mount St. Helens | url= https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/cir850D | year = 1981 | accessdate = 2007-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiggins02" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiggins | first1 = Tracy B. | last2 = Hansen|first2=Jon D. | last3 = Clark |first3= Douglas H. | title = Growth and flow of a new glacier in Mt.

With the recent volcanic activity starting in 2004, the glacier lobes were pushed aside and upward by the growth of new volcanic domes. The surface of the glacier, once mostly without crevasses, turned into a chaotic jumble of [[icefall]]s heavily criss-crossed with [[crevasse]]s and [[serac]]s caused by movement of the crater floor.&lt;ref name="VR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/volcano-review/documents/Volcano_Review_2008_Final_lowrez-201.pdf|title=Volcano Review|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626134702/http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/volcano-review/documents/Volcano_Review_2008_Final_lowrez-201.pdf |archivedate=2008-06-26|format=PDF|publisher=[[US Forest Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new domes have almost separated the Crater Glacier into an eastern and western lobe. Despite the volcanic activity, the termini of the glacier have still advanced, with a slight advance on the western lobe and a more considerable advance on the more shaded eastern lobe. Due to the advance, two lobes of the glacier joined together in late May 2008 and thus the glacier completely surrounds the lava domes.&lt;ref name="VR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SE"&gt;{{cite web|title=MSH08_aerial_new_dome_from_north_05-30-08|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Imgs/Jpg/MSH/MSH08/MSH08_aerial_new_dome_from_north_05-30-08_med.jpg|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626134704/http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Imgs/Jpg/MSH/MSH08/MSH08_aerial_new_dome_from_north_05-30-08_med.jpg|archivedate=2008-06-26|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|first=Steve|last=Schilling|date=2008-05-30|accessdate=2008-06-07}} - Glacier is still connected south of the lava dome.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NT"&gt;{{cite web|title=MSH08_aerial_st_helens_crater_from_north_05-30-08|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Imgs/Jpg/MSH/MSH08/MSH08_crater_glacier_arms_touching_05-30-08_med.jpg|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626134705/http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Imgs/Jpg/MSH/MSH08/MSH08_crater_glacier_arms_touching_05-30-08_med.jpg|archivedate=2008-06-26|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|first=Steve|last=Schilling|date=2008-05-30|accessdate=2008-06-07}} - Glacier arms touch on North end of glacier.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, since 2004, new glaciers have formed on the crater wall above Crater Glacier feeding rock and ice onto its surface below; there are two rock glaciers to the north of the eastern lobe of Crater Glacier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Haugerud, R.

==Geologic history==

===Ancestral stages of eruptive activity===
[[File:Cascade Range related plate tectonics-en.svg|thumb|alt=Map of the west coast of United States with dark lines in the ocean and location of Cascade Volcanoes.|[[Plate tectonics]] of the [[Cascade Range]]]]

The early eruptive stages of Mount St. Helens are known as the "Ape Canyon Stage" (around 40,000–35,000 years ago), the "Cougar Stage" (ca. 20,000–18,000 years ago), and the "Swift Creek Stage" (roughly 13,000–8,000 years ago).&lt;ref name="USDAHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/education/teachers-corner/library/volcanic-history-summary.shtml|publisher=USDA Forest Service |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011012508/http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/education/teachers-corner/library/volcanic-history-summary.shtml |archivedate=2008-10-11|title=Mount St. Helens - Summary of Volcanic History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern period, since about 2500 BCE, is called the "Spirit Lake Stage". Collectively, the pre–Spirit Lake stages are known as the "ancestral stages". The ancestral and modern stages differ primarily in the composition of the erupted lavas; ancestral lavas consisted of a characteristic mixture of [[dacite]] and [[andesite]], while modern lava is very diverse (ranging from [[olivine]] [[basalt]] to andesite and dacite).{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=214}}

St. Helens started its growth in the [[Pleistocene]] 37,600 years ago, during the Ape Canyon stage, with dacite and andesite eruptions of hot pumice and ash.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=214}} Thirty-six thousand years ago a large [[lahar|mudflow]] cascaded down the volcano;{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=214}} mudflows were significant forces in all of St. Helens' eruptive cycles. The Ape Canyon eruptive period ended around 35,000 years ago and was followed by 17,000 years of relative quiet. Parts of this ancestral cone were fragmented and transported by [[glacier]]s 14,000 to 18,000 years ago during the last glacial period of the [[Quaternary glaciation|current ice age]].{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=214}}

The second eruptive period, the Cougar Stage, started 20,000 years ago and lasted for 2,000 years.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=214}} [[Pyroclastic flow]]s of hot pumice and ash along with [[Lava dome|dome]] growth occurred during this period. Another 5,000 years of dormancy followed, only to be upset by the beginning of the Swift Creek eruptive period, typified by pyroclastic flows, dome growth and blanketing of the countryside with [[tephra]]. Swift Creek ended 8,000 years ago.

===Smith Creek and Pine Creek eruptive periods===
A dormancy of about 4,000 years was broken around 2500 BCE with the start of the Smith Creek eruptive period, when eruptions of large amounts of ash and yellowish-brown pumice covered thousands of square miles. An eruption in 1900 BCE was the largest known eruption from St. Helens during the [[Holocene]] epoch, judged by the volume of one of the tephra layers from that period. This eruptive period lasted until about 1600 BCE and left {{Convert|18|in|cm}} deep deposits of material {{Convert|50|mi|km|-1}} distant in what is now [[Mt. Rainier National Park]]. Trace deposits have been found as far northeast as [[Banff National Park]] in [[Alberta]], and as far southeast as eastern [[Oregon]].{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=215}} All told there may have been up to {{Convert|2.5|mi3|km3}} of material ejected in this cycle.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=215}} Some 400 years of dormancy followed.

St. Helens came alive again around 1200 BCE — the Pine Creek eruptive period.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=215}} This lasted until about 800 BCE and was characterized by smaller-volume eruptions. Numerous dense, nearly red hot pyroclastic flows sped down St. Helens' flanks and came to rest in nearby valleys. A large mudflow partly filled {{Convert|40|mi|km}} of the Lewis River valley sometime between 1000 BCE and 500 BCE.

===Castle Creek and Sugar Bowl eruptive periods===
The next eruptive period, the Castle Creek period, began about 400 BCE, and is characterized by a change in composition of St. Helens' lava, with the addition of [[olivine]] and [[basalt]].{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=216}} The pre-1980 summit cone started to form during the Castle Creek period. Significant lava flows in addition to the previously much more common fragmented and pulverized lavas and rocks ([[tephra]]) distinguished this period. Large lava flows of andesite and basalt covered parts of the mountain, including one around the year 100 BCE that traveled all the way into the Lewis and Kalama river valleys.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=216}} Others, such as Cave Basalt (known for its system of [[lava tube]]s), flowed up to {{Convert|9|mi|km}} from their vents.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=216}} During the first century, mudflows moved {{Convert|30|mi|km|-1}} down the Toutle and Kalama river valleys and may have reached the [[Columbia River]]. Another 400 years of [[dormancy]] ensued.

The Sugar Bowl eruptive period was short and markedly different from other periods in Mount St. Helens history. It produced the only unequivocal laterally directed blast known from Mount St. Helens before the 1980 eruptions.&lt;ref name="USGS-EruptiveHistory"/&gt; During Sugar Bowl time, the volcano first erupted quietly to produce a dome, then erupted violently at least twice producing a small volume of tephra, directed-blast deposits, pyroclastic flows, and lahars.&lt;ref name="USGS-EruptiveHistory"/&gt;

===Kalama and Goat Rocks eruptive periods===
[[File:1890 Clohessy and Strengele engraving of Mount St Helens.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of a rolling landscape with a conical mountain in background.|The symmetrical appearance of St. Helens prior to the 1980 eruption earned it the nickname "[[Mount Fuji]] of America". The once familiar shape was formed out of the Kalama and Goat Rocks eruptive periods.]]

Roughly 700 years of dormancy were broken in about 1480, when large amounts of pale gray dacite pumice and ash started to erupt, beginning the Kalama period. The eruption in 1480 was several times larger than the May 18, 1980, eruption.&lt;ref name="USGS-EruptiveHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/Publications/PP1563/eruptive_history.html|title=Mount St. Helens Eruptive History|publisher=USGS|accessdate=2006-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1482, another large eruption rivaling the 1980 eruption in volume is known to have occurred.&lt;ref name="USGS-EruptiveHistory"/&gt; Ash and pumice piled {{Convert|6|mi|km}} northeast of the volcano to a thickness of {{Convert|3|ft|m|1}}; {{Convert|50|mi|km|-1}} away, the ash was {{Convert|2|in|cm|0}} deep. Large pyroclastic flows and mudflows subsequently rushed down St. Helens' west flanks and into the Kalama River drainage system.

This 150-year period next saw the eruption of less [[silica]]-rich lava in the form of [[andesitic]] ash that formed at least eight alternating light- and dark-colored layers.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=216}} Blocky andesite lava then flowed from St. Helens' summit crater down the volcano's southeast flank.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=216}} Later, pyroclastic flows raced down over the andesite lava and into the Kalama River valley. It ended with the emplacement of a dacite dome several hundred feet (~200 m) high at the volcano's summit, which filled and overtopped an explosion crater already at the summit.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=217}} Large parts of the dome's sides broke away and mantled parts of the volcano's cone with [[Scree|talus]]. Lateral explosions excavated a notch in the southeast crater wall. St. Helens reached its greatest height and achieved its highly symmetrical form by the time the Kalama eruptive cycle ended, in about 1647.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=217}} The volcano remained quiet for the next 150 years.

The 57-year eruptive period that started in 1800 was named after the Goat Rocks dome, and is the first time that both oral and written records exist.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=217}} Like the Kalama period, the Goat Rocks period started with an explosion of [[dacite]] [[tephra]], followed by an andesite lava flow, and culminated with the emplacement of a dacite dome. The 1800 eruption probably rivalled the 1980 eruption in size, although it did not result in massive destruction of the cone. The ash drifted northeast over central and eastern [[Washington (state)|Washington]], northern [[Idaho]], and western [[Montana]]. There were at least a dozen reported small eruptions of ash from 1831 to 1857, including a fairly large one in 1842. The vent was apparently at or near Goat Rocks on the northeast flank.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=217}} Goat Rocks dome was the site of the bulge in the 1980 eruption, and it was obliterated in the major eruption event on May 18, 1980 that destroyed the entire north face and top {{Convert|1300|ft|m}} of the mountain.

===Modern eruptive period===

On March 20, 1980, Mount St. Helens experienced a [[Richter magnitude scale|magnitude]] 4.2 [[earthquake]];&lt;ref name="USDA" /&gt; and, on March 27, steam venting started.&lt;ref name="USDAMay18"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/education/teachers-corner/library/pre-eruption-0322.shtml|publisher=USDA Forest Service |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113092736/http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/education/teachers-corner/library/pre-eruption-0322.shtml |archivedate=2007-11-13 |title=Summary of Events Leading Up to the May 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens: March 22–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of April, the north side of the mountain had started to bulge.&lt;ref name="USDAMay18_2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/education/teachers-corner/library/pre-eruption-0426.shtml |publisher=USDA Forest Service |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113092741/http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/education/teachers-corner/library/pre-eruption-0426.shtml |archivedate=2007-11-13 |title=Summary of Events Leading Up to the May 18, 1980 Eruption of Mount St. Helens: April 26–May 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On May 18, a second earthquake, of magnitude 5.1, triggered a massive collapse of the north face of the mountain. It was the largest known [[debris avalanche]] in recorded history. The [[magma]] in St. Helens burst forth into a large-scale [[pyroclastic flow]] that flattened vegetation and buildings over {{convert|230|sqmi|km2|-1}}. More than 1.5 million metric tons of sulfur dioxide was released into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/activity/methods/gas/msh1980-88.php |title=Emission of sulfur dioxide gas from Mount St. Helens, 1980-1988 |publisher=United States Geological Survey |date=2008-09-25 |accessdate=2009-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]] scale, the eruption was rated a five, and categorized as a [[Plinian eruption]].
[[File:MSH80 eruption mount st helens 05-18-80.jpg|thumb|upright|Mount St. Helens erupted on May 18, 1980, at 08:32 [[Pacific Daylight Time]].]]

The collapse of the northern flank of St. Helens mixed with ice, snow, and water to create [[lahar]]s (volcanic mudflows). The lahars flowed many miles down the [[Toutle River|Toutle]] and [[Cowlitz River]]s, destroying bridges and lumber camps. A total of {{convert|3900000|yd3|m3|-5}} of material was transported {{convert|17|mi|km}} south into the [[Columbia River]] by the mudflows.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=209}}

For more than nine hours, a vigorous plume of ash erupted, eventually reaching 12 to 16 miles (20 to 27&amp;nbsp;km) above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;Kiver and Harris, ''Geology of U.S. Parklands'', 6th edition, page 149&lt;/ref&gt; The plume moved eastward at an average speed of {{convert|60|mph|km/h|-1}} with ash reaching [[Idaho]] by noon. Ashes from the eruption were found collecting on top of cars and roofs next morning, as far as the city of Edmonton in Alberta, Canada.

By about 5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on May 18, the vertical ash column declined in stature, and less severe outbursts continued through the night and for the next several days.

Between 1980 and 1986, activity continued at Mount St. Helens, with a new [[lava dome]] forming in the crater. Numerous small explosions and dome-building eruptions occurred. From December 7, 1989, to January 6, 1990, and from November 5, 1990, to February 14, 1991, the mountain erupted with sometimes huge clouds of ash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/Publications/EV23/small_expl.html |first=Bobbie |last=Myers |year=1992 |title=Small Explosions Interrupt 3-year Quiescence at Mount St. Helens, Washington |journal=Earthquakes and Volcanoes |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=58–73 |accessdate=2006-11-26 |via=vulcan.wr.usgs.gov |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230141620/http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/Publications/EV23/small_expl.html |archive-date=2006-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2004 to 2008 activity====
{{Main|2004–08 volcanic activity of Mount St. Helens}}

Magma reached the surface of the volcano about October 11, 2004, resulting in the building of a new lava dome on the existing dome's south side. This new dome continued to grow throughout 2005 and into 2006. Several transient features were observed, such as a [[lava spine]] nicknamed the "whaleback", which comprised long shafts of solidified magma being extruded by the pressure of magma beneath. These features were fragile and broke down soon after they were formed. On July 2, 2005, the tip of the whaleback broke off, causing a rockfall that sent ash and dust several hundred meters into the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Before and After images |publisher=USGS |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050903224652/http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Imgs/Jpg/MSH/MSH05/MSH05_dome_from_sugarbowl_tip_spine_collapse_July2005_med.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Whaleback, Mount St Helens volcanic crater (February 22 2005).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Large fairly smooth rock structure inside a crater|Appearance of the "Whaleback" in February 2005]]

Mount St. Helens showed significant activity on March 8, 2005, when a {{convert|36000|ft|m|adj=on}} plume of steam and ash emerged—visible from [[Seattle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050311015440/http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/Eruption04/Monitoring/plume_in_the_evening_8march05.html |url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/Eruption04/Monitoring/plume_in_the_evening_8march05.html |archivedate=2005-03-11 |title=Mount St. Helens, Washington – 'Plume in the Evening' |date=March 8, 2005 |publisher=USGS |accessdate=2006-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relatively minor eruption was a release of pressure consistent with ongoing dome building. The release was accompanied by a magnitude 2.5 earthquake.

Another feature to emerge from the dome was called the "fin" or "slab".

The height of the dome was {{Convert|7550|ft|m}}, still below the height reached in July 2005 when the whaleback collapsed.

On October 22, 2006, at 3:13&amp;nbsp;p.m. PST, a magnitude 3.5 earthquake broke loose Spine 7. The collapse and avalanche of the lava dome sent an ash plume {{Convert|2000|ft|m|-2}} over the western rim of the crater; the [[ash plume]] then rapidly dissipated.

On December 19, 2006, a large white plume of condensing steam was observed, leading some media people to assume there had been a small eruption. However, the [[Cascades Volcano Observatory]] of the USGS did not mention any significant ash plume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/ |title=In the News |website=Cascades Volcano Observatory |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107023839/http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/ |archive-date=2007-01-07 |accessdate=2007-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volcano was in continuous eruption from October 2004, but this eruption consisted in large part of a gradual extrusion of lava forming a dome in the crater.

On January 16, 2008, steam began seeping from a fracture on top of the lava dome. Associated seismic activity was the most noteworthy since 2004. Scientists suspended activities in the crater and the mountain flanks, but the risk of a major eruption was deemed low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2008-01-17-3582451403_x.htm |title=Small Quake Reported at Mount St. Helens |newspaper=USA Today |accessdate=2010-12-06 |date=January 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of January, the eruption paused; no more lava was being extruded from the lava dome.

==Human history==

===Importance to Native Americans===
[[File:St Helens before 1980 eruption horizon fixed.jpg|thumb|alt=Mt St Helens before the 1980 eruption (taken from Spirit Lake)|[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American]] legends were inspired by the volcano's beauty.]]

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] lore contains numerous legends to explain the eruptions of Mount St. Helens and other Cascade volcanoes. The most famous of these is the [[Bridge of the Gods (geologic event)|Bridge of the Gods]] legend told by the [[Klickitat people]]. In their tale, the chief of all the gods&lt;!--, [[Tyhee Saghalie]],--&gt; and his two sons, Pahto (also called Klickitat) and Wy'east, traveled down the [[Columbia River]] from the Far North in search for a suitable area to settle.&lt;ref name="CountyRoads"&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Archie Satterfield |last=Satterfield |first=Archie |title=Country Roads of Washington |publisher=iUniverse |year=2003 |isbn=0-595-26863-3 |page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They came upon an area that is now called [[The Dalles]] and thought they had never seen a land so beautiful. The sons quarreled over the land, so to solve the dispute their father shot two arrows from his mighty bow &amp;mdash; one to the north and the other to the south. Pahto followed the arrow to the north and settled there while Wy'east did the same for the arrow to the south. The chief of the gods then built &lt;!--[[Tanmahawis]],--&gt; the Bridge of the Gods, so his family could meet periodically.&lt;ref name="CountyRoads"/&gt;

When the two sons of the chief of the gods fell in love with a beautiful maiden named Loowit, she could not choose between them. The two young chiefs fought over her, burying villages and forests in the process. The area was devastated and the earth shook so violently that the huge bridge fell into the river, creating the [[Plunge waterfalls|cascades]] of the [[Columbia River Gorge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoutlaws.com/indians4.htm |title=The Bridge of the Gods |website=theoutlaws.com |accessdate=2006-11-26 |dead-url=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720204304/http://www.theoutlaws.com/indians4.htm |archive-date=2006-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For punishment, the chief of the gods struck down each of the lovers and transformed them into great mountains where they fell. Wy'east, with his head lifted in pride, became the volcano known today as Mount Hood. Pahto, with his head bent toward his fallen love, was turned into Mount Adams. The fair Loowit became Mount St. Helens, known to the Klickitats as Louwala-Clough, which means "smoking or fire mountain" in their language (the [[Sahaptin people|Sahaptin]] called the mountain Loowit).&lt;ref name=crvn&gt;{{cite web |title=Volcanoes and History: Cascade Range Volcano Names |url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/LivingWith/Historical/volcano_names.html |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028220658/http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/LivingWith/Historical/volcano_names.html |archive-date=2006-10-28 |publisher=USGS |accessdate=2006-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mountain is also of sacred importance to the [[Cowlitz people|Cowlitz]] and [[Yakama people|Yakama]] tribes that also historically lived in the area.  They find the area above its tree line to be of exceptional spiritual significance, and the mountain (which they call "Lawetlat'la", roughly translated as "the smoker") features prominently in their creation myth, and in some of their songs and rituals.  In recognition of this cultural significance, over {{convert|12000|acre|ha}} of the mountain (roughly bounded by the Loowit Trail) have been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=NRHPnom&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/feature/places/pdfs/13000748.pdf |title=NRHP nomination form and supplementary listing record for Lawetlat'la [Mount St. Helens] |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other area tribal names for the mountain include "nšh´ák´" ("water coming out") from the [[Chehalis people|Upper Chehalis]], and "aka akn" ("snow mountain"), a [[Kiksht]] term.&lt;ref name=NRHPnom/&gt;

===Exploration by Europeans===
[[Royal Navy]] Commander [[George Vancouver]] and the officers of [[HMS Discovery (1789)|HMS ''Discovery'']] made the Europeans' first recorded sighting of Mount St. Helens on May 19, 1792, while surveying the northern [[Pacific Ocean]] coast. Vancouver named the mountain for British diplomat [[Alleyne Fitzherbert, 1st Baron St Helens]] on October 20, 1792,&lt;ref name="crvn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vancouver|first1=George|authorlink=George Vancouver|title=A Voyage of Discovery to the North Pacific Ocean, and Round the World|date=1798|location=London|pages=421–422|url=https://archive.org/stream/voyageofdiscover01vanc#page/420/mode/2up|oclc=54529835|ol=24592146M}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it came into view when the ''Discovery'' passed into the mouth of the Columbia River.

Years later, explorers, traders, and missionaries heard reports of an erupting volcano in the area. Geologists and historians determined much later that the eruption took place in 1800, marking the beginning of the 57-year-long Goat Rocks Eruptive Period (see [[#Geologic history|geology section]]).{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=217}} Alarmed by the "dry snow," the Nespelem tribe of northeastern Washington danced and prayed rather than collecting food and suffered during that winter from starvation.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=217}}

In late 1805 and early 1806, members of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] spotted Mount St. Helens from the Columbia River but did not report either an ongoing eruption or recent evidence of one.{{sfn|Pringle|1993}} They did however report the presence of [[quicksand]] and clogged channel conditions at the mouth of the [[Sandy River (Oregon)|Sandy River]] near Portland, suggesting an eruption by [[Mount Hood]] sometime in the previous decades.

In 1829 [[Hall J. Kelley]] led a campaign to rename the Cascade Range as the President's Range and also to rename each major Cascade mountain after a former [[President of the United States]]. In his scheme Mount St. Helens was to be renamed Mount Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Meany |first= Edmond S. |authorlink= Edmond S. Meany |year= 1920 |title= Origin of Washington Geographic Names |journal= The Washington Historical Quarterly |volume= XI |pages= 211–212 |publisher= Washington University State Historical Society |url= https://books.google.com/?id=dbsUAAAAYAAJ |accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European settlement and use of the area===
[[File:Fur trapper in Mount St Helen area.jpg|thumb|alt=Man by wooden building that has six fur pelts on it.|19th-century photo of a [[fur trapper]] working in the Mount St. Helens area]]

The first authenticated eyewitness report of a volcanic eruption was made in March 1835 by [[Meredith Gairdner]], while working for the Hudson's Bay Company stationed at [[Fort Vancouver]].{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=219}} He sent an account to the ''Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal'', which published his letter in January 1836. [[James Dwight Dana]] of [[Yale University]], while sailing with the [[United States Exploring Expedition]], saw the quiescent peak from off the mouth of the Columbia River in 1841. Another member of the expedition later described "cellular basaltic lavas" at the mountain's base.&lt;ref name="USGS-LewisClark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/LivingWith/Historical/LewisClark/Info/summary_mount_st_helens.html|title=The Volcanoes of Lewis and Clark|publisher=USGS|accessdate=2006-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mount St Helens erupting at night by Paul Kane.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Painting of a conical volcano erupting at night from the side.|Painting by [[Paul Kane]] ''Mount St. Helens erupting at night'' after his 1847 visit to the area]]
In late fall or early winter of 1842, nearby settlers and missionaries witnessed the so-called Great Eruption. This small-volume outburst created large ash clouds, and mild explosions followed for 15 years.{{sfn|Harris|1988|pp=220-221}} The eruptions of this period were likely [[phreatic eruption|phreatic]] (steam explosions). [[Josiah L. Parrish|Josiah Parrish]] in [[Champoeg, Oregon]] witnessed Mount St. Helens in eruption on November 22, 1842. Ash from this eruption may have reached [[The Dalles, Oregon]], 48 miles (80&amp;nbsp;km) southeast of the volcano.&lt;ref name="USGS-Description"/&gt;

In October 1843, future [[California]] governor [[Peter Hardeman Burnett|Peter H. Burnett]] recounted a story of an aboriginal American man who badly burned his foot and leg in lava or hot ash while hunting for deer. The likely apocryphal story went that the injured man sought treatment at Fort Vancouver, but the contemporary fort commissary steward, Napoleon McGilvery, disclaimed knowledge of the incident.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=224}} British lieutenant Henry J. Warre sketched the eruption in 1845, and two years later Canadian painter [[Paul Kane]] created watercolors of the gently smoking mountain. Warre's work showed erupting material from a vent about a third of the way down from the summit on the mountain's west or northwest side (possibly at Goat Rocks), and one of Kane's field sketches shows smoke emanating from about the same location.{{sfn|Harris|1988|pp=225,227}}

[[file:On the Summit of St. Helens.png|thumb|A hiker at the summit of Mount St. Helens, as depicted in [[Frances Fuller Victor]]'s 1891 ''[[wikisource:en:Atlantis Arisen|Atlantis Arisen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Atlantis arisen, or, Talks of a tourist about Oregon and Washington |author=Victor, Frances Fuller |url=https://archive.org/details/atlantisarisenor00vict |year=1891 |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Lippincott |access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
On April 17, 1857, the ''Republican'', a [[Steilacoom, Washington]], newspaper, reported that "Mount St. Helens, or some other mount to the southward, is seen ... to be in a state of eruption".{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=228}} The lack of a significant ash layer associated with this event indicates that it was a small eruption. This was the first reported volcanic activity since 1854.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=228}}

Before the 1980 eruption, [[Spirit Lake (Washington)|Spirit Lake]] offered year-round recreational activities. In the summer there was [[boating]], [[human swimming|swimming]], and [[camping]], while in the winter there was [[skiing]].

===Human impact from the 1980 eruption===
[[File:MSH80 david johnston at camp 05-17-80 med.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Man sitting at a campsite|[[David A. Johnston]] hours before he was killed by the eruption]]

83-year-old [[Harry Randall Truman|Harry R. Truman]], who had lived near the mountain for 54 years, became famous when he decided not to evacuate before the impending eruption, despite repeated pleas by local authorities.&lt;ref name=ETEV&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cotf.edu/ete/modules/volcanoes/vtruman.html |title=Harry Truman and His 16 Cats |date=January 27, 2011 |accessdate=2011-06-26 |publisher=[[Wheeling Jesuit University]] Center for Educational Technologies |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121211084252/http://www.cotf.edu/ete/modules/volcanoes/vtruman.html |archive-date=2012-12-11 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was never found after the eruption.&lt;ref name=sis&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=M9MvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PPkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5277,988696&amp;dq= |title=Sister, friend say Harry probably dead |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=May 20, 1980 |work=[[Spokane Daily Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another victim of the eruption was 30-year-old [[volcanologist]] [[David A. Johnston]], who was stationed on the nearby Coldwater Ridge. Moments before his position was hit by the pyroclastic flow, Johnston radioed his famous last words: "Vancouver! Vancouver! This is it!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott|last=LaFee|url=http://legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/science/20031203-9999_mz1c3deadsci.html|title=Perish the thought: A life in science sometimes becomes a death, too|newspaper=San Diego Union-Tribune|date=December 3, 2003|accessdate=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston's body was never found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Across the USA: News From Every State|work=[[USA Today]]|date=1993-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] surveyed the damage and said, "Someone said this area looked like a moonscape.

Their [[compass]]es, however, spun in circles and they quickly became lost. A second eruption occurred on May 25, but the crew survived and was rescued two days later by [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] helicopter pilots. Their film, ''The Eruption of Mount St. Helens'', later became a popular documentary.

===Protection and later history===

In 1982, President [[Ronald Reagan]] and the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] established the [[Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument]], a {{Convert|110000|acre|ha|-3}} area around the mountain and within the [[Gifford Pinchot National Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041121011430/http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/04mshnvm/general/index.shtml|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/04mshnvm/general/index.shtml|archivedate=2004-11-21 |title=Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument: General Visitor Information|publisher=USDA Forest Service|accessdate=2006-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1980 eruption, the area was left to gradually return to its natural state. In 1987, the [[United States Forest Service|U.S. Forest Service]] reopened the mountain to climbing. It remained open until 2004 when [[2004–2008 volcanic activity of Mount St. Helens|renewed activity]] caused the closure of the area around the mountain (see ''Geological history'' section above for more details).

Most notable was the closure of the Monitor Ridge trail, which previously let up to 100 permitted hikers per day climb to the summit. On July 21, 2006, the mountain was again opened to climbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041019030041/http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/recreation/current-conditions/special.shtml |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/recreation/current-conditions/special.shtml |archivedate=2004-10-19 |title=Climbing Mount St. Helens |publisher=USDA Forest Service |accessdate=2006-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, a climber died after falling from the rim into the crater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mynorthwest.com/?nid=11&amp;sid=285165 |title=Climber dies after rescue attempts fail on Mount St. Helens |date=February 17, 2010 |website=MyNorthwest.com |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721130446/http://mynorthwest.com/?nid=11&amp;sid=285165 |archive-date=2011-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mountain is now circled by the Loowit Trail at elevations of 4000–4900 feet (1,200-1,500 m). The northern segment of the trail from the South Fork Toutle River on the west to Windy Pass on the east is a restricted zone where camping, biking, pets, fires, and off-trail excursions are all prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite summitpost |id=742347 |name=Loowit Trail |accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5160314.pdf |title=Mount St. Helens Volcanic National Monument: Restricted Area |publisher=USDA Forest Service |accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climbing and recreation==

Mount St. Helens is a popular climbing destination for both beginning and experienced [[Mountaineering|mountaineers]]. The peak is climbed year-round, although it is more often climbed from late spring through early fall. All routes include sections of steep, rugged terrain.&lt;ref&gt;
  {{cite web

  | accessdate = 2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A permit system has been in place for climbers since 1987. A climbing permit is required year-round for anyone who will be above {{convert|4800|ft}} on the slopes of Mount St. Helens.&lt;ref&gt;
  {{cite web

  | accessdate = 2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard [[hiking]]/[[mountaineering]] route in the warmer months is the Monitor Ridge Route, which starts at the Climbers Bivouac. This is the most popular and crowded route to the summit in the summer and gains about {{convert|4600|ft}} in approximately {{convert|5|mi||sigfig=1}} to reach the crater rim.&lt;ref&gt;

  | title = Monitor Ridge
  | publisher = SummitPost.org
  | accessdate = 2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although strenuous, it is considered non-technical climb that involves some [[scrambling]]. Most climbers complete the round trip in 7 to 12 hours.&lt;ref&gt;
  {{cite web

  | publisher = U.S. Forest Service
  | accessdate = 2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Worm Flows Route is considered the standard winter route on Mount St. Helens, as it is the most direct route to the summit. The route gains about {{convert|5700|ft}} in elevation over about {{convert|6|mi||round=5}} from trailhead to summit but does not demand the technical climbing that some other Cascade peaks like [[Mount Rainier]] do. The route name refers to the rocky lava flows that surround the route.&lt;ref&gt;

== Natural Gas Consumption ==
Considering China's immense demand for energy, gas plays a relatively small role in its energy use, with only 5% of total energy in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Herberg, Mikkal. (2013, November). "Introduction: Asia's Uncertain LNG Future". ''NBR Special Report.'' Retrieved from http://www.nbr.org/publications/element.aspx?id=709.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chinese authorities see natural gas as a lower-polluting and less carbon-intensive alternative to coal, and gas consumption is increasing rapidly. Natural gas is expected to supply 10% of the nation’s energy supply by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;US EIA, [http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=17591 Natural gas serves a small, but growing, portion of China’s total energy demand], Today in Energy, 18 Aug. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Natural Gas Supply ==
[[File:China Gas Production.png|thumb|Natural gas production in China, 1980-2012]]

=== Production ===
[[China]] produced 112 billion cubic meters of [[natural gas]] in 2013, making it the sixth largest gas producer in the world.Gas production more than doubled over the period 2005-2013.&lt;ref&gt;OPEC, [http://www.opec.org/library/Annual%20Statistical%20Bulletin/interactive/current/FileZ/XL/T32.HTM Statistical Bulletin], accessed 29 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Natural Gas Imports ===
Despite rapidly rising natural gas production, in 2013 China imported 52 billion cubic meters of natural gas, making it the world's fifth largest gas importer. Imports increased more than tenfold in the period 2008-2013.&lt;ref&gt;OPEC, [http://www.opec.org/library/Annual%20Statistical%20Bulletin/interactive/current/FileZ/XL/T32.HTM Statistical Bulletin], accessed 29 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; China has worked to diversify its sources for natural gas imports. 

In 2013, China was the world’s third-largest importer of LNG, behind Japan and Korea. In that year, 85% of China's LNG supply came from Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;Ma, Damien. (2013, November). "China's Coming Decade of Natural Gas". ''NBR Special Report: Asia's Uncertain LNG Future.'' Retrieved from http://www.nbr.org/publications/element.aspx?id=711&lt;/ref&gt;

To lessen dependence on LNG, China has built pipelines to import natural gas from [[Myanmar]] and Central Asia. In 2014, China closed a deal with Russia to import large volumes of gas from eastern Russia, starting in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;US EIA, [http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=17591 Natural gas serves a small, but growing, portion of China’s total energy demand], Today in Energy, 18 Aug. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neltje Blanchan De Graff Doubleday''' (October 23, 1865 – February 21, 1918) was a United States scientific historian and [[nature writer]] who published several books on [[wildflowers]] and [[birds]] under the [[pen name]] '''Neltje Blanchan'''.&lt;ref name="Sterling"&gt;{{cite book | last =Sterling | first = Kier | authorlink = | title = Women in the Biological Sciences: A Biobibliographic Sourcebook | publisher = Greenwood Press | year = 1997 | location = Westport, CT | pages = | isbn = 0-313-29180-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work is known for its synthesis of scientific interest with poetic phrasing.

== Biography ==

===Early life and education===
Neltje Blanchan De Graff was born in Chicago to Liverius De Graff, a proprietor of a men's clothing store, and his wife Alice Fair. She was educated at [[St. John's Preparatory School (New York City)|St. John's Preparatory School]] in New York City and [[Masters School|The Masters School]] in [[Dobbs Ferry, New York]].&lt;ref name="Patterson"&gt;{{cite book | last = Patterson | first = Daniel | authorlink = |author2=Roger Thompson | title =Early American Nature Writers: A Biographical Encyclopedia | publisher = Greenwood | year = 2007 | location = | pages = 62 | isbn = 978-0-313-34680-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neltje married [[Frank Nelson Doubleday]] in [[Plainfield, New Jersey]] on June 9, 1886. They had two sons and one daughter: Felix Doty (adopted), [[Nelson Doubleday|Nelson]] (1889–1949) and Dorothy. They had homes in both New York City and [[Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York|Oyster Bay]].

===Writing career===
Neltje Doubleday published eleven books under her pen name of Neltje Blanchan. Her works on [[wildflowers]] and [[birds]] were notable for their combination of scientific facts with poetic expression.

===Community service===
Neltje Doubleday entertained regularly and participated in philanthropic work for the [[American Red Cross]].&lt;ref name="Sterling"/&gt;

In 1917 she visited [[the Philippines]] and [[China]] on special assignment as a commissioner for the Red Cross. She died suddenly in [[Guangzhou|Canton, China]] on February 21, 1918 at age 52.&lt;ref name="Sterling"/&gt;

==Legacy and honors==
*Some of her papers (1914–1918) are held in the [[Frank N. Doubleday]] and [[Nelson Doubleday]] Collection at the [[Princeton University Library]].
*The [[Wyoming Arts Council]] established the Neltje Blanchan Literary Award (now called the Blanchan/Doubleday Writing Award), which is given annually to "a writer whose work, in any genre, is inspired by nature." The award was funded in Blanchan's memory by her granddaughter, [[Neltje Doubleday Kings]], an abstract artist who served on the board of the Council from 1985 to 1988.  In 2010 Neltje Kings made an estate gift to the [[University of Wyoming]], including her land, ranch and studio buildings, art collections, which is the largest in the history of the university.  When realized, it will become the UW Neltje Center for the Visual and Literary Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last =| first =| author-link =| last2 =| first2 =| author2-link =| title =Gift will create powerhouse arts center| newspaper =UWYO| pages =| date =Fall 2010| url =http://www.uwyo.edu/uwyo/2011/docs/UWyo12.2.pdf| accessdate =}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nellie's grandson [[Nelson Doubleday Jr.]] was president of the [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] publishing company from 1978–1986, when he sold it to the [[Bertelsmann]] group from Germany.  He purchased the [[New York Mets]] in 1986 and was chairman of its board that year when it won the [[World Series]] title. In 2002 he sold his half share in the team.

'''Orthosilicic acid''' is the [[chemical compound]] with formula {{chem|Si(|OH|)|4}}. It is assumed to be present in dilute solutions of [[silicon dioxide]] (silica) {{chem|SiO|2}} in water. It can be synthesized in [[non-aqueous solution]]s.

==Introduction==
The term "silicic acid" has traditionally been used as a [[synonym]] for [[silicon dioxide]], SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, also known as "silica". Strictly speaking, silica is the [[anhydride]] of orthosilicic acid, Si(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, from which it can be obtained by a [[dehydration reaction]]. 
:Si(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↓ + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The solubility of silica in pure water is about 1.5mM, or less, depending on the solid state structure of the compound. Because the concentration of orthosilicic acid is so low, it has not been fully characterized. It has been predicted to be "a very weak acid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pauling |first1=Linus |title=The nature of the chemical bond |date=1960 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaka, New York |page=557 |edition=3rd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; More concentrated solutions of orthosilicic acid are unstable and turn into [[silica gel]] and other species.&lt;ref name=gye/&gt;

The situation changed in 2017, when the orthosilicic acid monomer was obtained by [[hydrogenolysis]] of tetrakis(benzoyloxy)silane, (Si(OCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, in solution in [[dimethylacetamide]] or related solvents. The crystal structure of this compound  was determined by [[X-ray crystallography]]. [[Neutron diffraction]] was also used to determine the location of the hydrogen atoms. Di-silicic acid was synthesized by hydrogenation of its hexa-benzoyloxy derivative, R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-SiOSi-R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, R=CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O. Cyclic trisilicic acid, Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and cyclic tetrasilicic acid, Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; were synthesized by variations of this method.&lt;ref name=synthesis&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Igarashi |first1=Masayasu |last2=Matsumoto |first2=Tomohiro |last3=Yagahashi |first3=Fujio |last4=Yamashita |first4=Hiroshi |last5=Ohhara |first5=Takashi |last6=Hanashima |first6=Takayasu |last7=Nakao |first7=Akiko |last8=Moyosh |first8=Taketo |last9=Sato |first9=Kazuhiko |last10=Shimada |first10=Shigeru |title=Non-aqueous selective synthesis of orthosilicic acid and its oligomers |journal=Nature Communications |date=2017 |volume=8  |issue=1 |pages=140 |doi=10.1038/s41467-017-00168-5|pmid=28747652|pmc=5529440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With these new discoveries, the term ''silicic acid'' has become ambiguous: it has been applied traditionally as a synonym for silica, SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but it can now also be used for the compound Si(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The traditional meaning is retained in this article when it was used as such in a cited publication.

==Plants and animals==
Outside the marine environment compounds of silicon have very little biological function. Small quantities of silica are absorbed from the soil by some plants, to be then excreted in the form of [[phytolith]]s.&lt;ref name=snyder&gt;G.H.Snyder (2001): "Methods for silicon analysis in plants, soils, and fertilizers". ''Studies in Plant Science'', volume 8, chapter 11, Pages 185-196 {{doi|10.1016/S0928-3420(01)80015-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subcutaneous injections of orthosilicic acid solutions (around 1%) in [[mice]] were found to cause local [[inflammation]] and [[edema]].  [[peritoneum|Peritoneal]] injections of 0.1 [[milliliter|mL]] of freshly prepared acid were often lethal. The toxicity decreased markedly as the solution aged, to the point that after the solution turned to a gel it had no effects other than mechanical ones.  The solutions were equally toxic when administed by [[intravenous injection]], but seasoned or gelled solutions were about as toxic as fresh ones.&lt;ref  name=gye&gt;W. E. Gye and W. J. Purdy (1922): "The Poisonous Properties of Colloidal Silica. I: The Effects of the Parenteral Administration of Large Doses" ''British Journal of Experimental Pathology'', volume 3, issue 2, pages 75–85. {{PMC|2047780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research concerning the correlation of [[aluminium]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]] has included the ability of silicic acid in beer to reduce aluminium uptake in the digestive system as well as to increase renal excretion of aluminium &lt;ref name="pmid16988476"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Exley C, Korchazhkina O, Job D, Strekopytov S, Polwart A, Crome P |title=Non-invasive therapy to reduce the body burden of aluminium in Alzheimer's disease |journal=J.

''Dissolved silica'' (DSi) is a term used in the field of oceanography to describe the form of water-soluble [[silica]], which is assumed to be {{chem|Si(OH)|4}} (orthoslicic acid) or its conjugate bases (orthosilicate anions) such as {{chem|Si(OH)|3|O|-}} and {{chem|Si(OH)|2|O|2|2-}}. Theoretical computations indicate that the dissolution of silica in water proceeds through the formation of a {{chem|SiO|2}}·2{{chem|H|2|O}} complex and then orthosilicic acid.&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskar Mondal, Deepanwita Ghosh, and Abhijit K.

In the uppermost water column the surface [[ocean]] is undersaturated with respect to dissolved silica, except for the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] south of 55°S.

For many decades it was debated whether orthosilicic acid, Si(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, exists in [[aqueous solution]]s at ambient temperature;&lt;ref name = Iler&gt;{{cite book |last1=Iler |first1=Ralph K. |title=The Chemistry of Silica: Solubility, Polymerization, Colloid and Surface Properties and Biochemistry of Silica |date=1970 |publisher=Wley |location=New York |isbn= 978-0-471-02404-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; this uncertainty originated from the poor solubility of [[silicon dioxide]], SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
:Si(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) &lt;chem&gt; &lt;=&gt;&gt;&lt;/chem&gt; SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↓ + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The [[solubility product|solubility]] of silicon dioxide in water strongly depends on its crystal structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fournier |first1=Robert O. |last2=Rowe |first2=Jack J. |title=The solubility of amorphous silica in water at high temperatures and high pressures |journal=American Mineralogist |date=1977 |volume=62 |pages=1052–1056|url=http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM62/AM62_1052.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species that are present in a solution  in equilibrium with a solid have not been definitively characterised because of their low concentrations. Many authors have speculated that silicic acid may be present, at [[Molar concentration|sub-millimolar]] concentrations, in rivers, lakes and sea water.&lt;ref name="Iler"/&gt;

Orthosilicic acid was synthesized for the first time in the year 2017.&lt;ref name=synthesis&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Igarashi |first1=Masayasu |last2=Matsumoto |first2=Tomohiro |last3=Yagahashi |first3=Fujio |last4=Yamashita |first4=Hiroshi |last5=Ohhara |first5=Takashi |last6=Hanashima |first6=Takayasu |last7=Nakao |first7=Akiko |last8=Moyosh |first8=Taketo |last9=Sato |first9=Kazuhiko |last10=Shimada |first10=Shigeru |title=Non-aqueous selective synthesis of orthosilicic acid and its oligomers |journal=Nature Communications |date=2017 |volume=8  |issue=1 |pages=140 |doi=10.1038/s41467-017-00168-5|pmid=28747652|pmc=5529440}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was obtained by [[hydrogenolysis]] of tetrakis(benzoyloxy)silane, (Si(OCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, in solution in [[dimethylacetamide]] or related solvents. The crystal structure of this compound  was determined by [[X-ray crystallography]]. [[Neutron diffraction]] was also used to determine the location of the hydrogen atoms.

The conversion of mono-silicic acid to di-silicic acid
:2 Si(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → (HO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiOSi((OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
is a [[dehydration reaction]], not an [[acid-base reaction]]; in consequence, di-silicic acid cannot be easily obtained from  mono-silicic acid. Di-silicic acid was synthesized by hydrogenation of its hexa-benzoyloxy derivative, R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-SiOSi-R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, R=CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O. Cyclic trisilicic acid, Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and cyclic tetrasilicic acid, Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; were synthesized by variations of this method.&lt;ref name=synthesis/&gt; 

The derivative Si(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F has been characterized in aqueous solutions containing "silicic acid" and the [[fluoride]] ion. A fluoride [[Ion selective electrode]] was used to determine its [[Acid dissociation constant|stability constant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ciavatta |first1=Liberato |last2=Iuliano |first2=Mauro |last3=Porto |first3=Raffaella |title=Fluorosilicate equilibria in acid solution |journal=Polyhedron |date=1988 |volume=7 |issue=18 |pages=1773–1779 |doi=10.1016/S0277-5387(00)80410-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concentration of silicic acid was maintained below 2.5×10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; mol/L.

In [[geology]],  a '''palimpsest''' is a geographical feature composed of superimposed structures created at different times. Palimpsest is beginning to be used by [[glaciology|glaciologists]] to describe contradicting glacial flow indicators, usually consisting of smaller indicators (i.e., striae) overprinted upon larger features (i.e., stoss and lee topography, drumlins, etc.).

The '''Plate Tectonics Revolution''' was the scientific and cultural change which developed from the acceptance of the [[plate tectonics]] theory. The event was a [[paradigm shift]] and scientific revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casadevall|first1=Arturo|last2=Fang|first2=Ferric C.|title=Revolutionary Science|journal=mBio|date=1 March 2016|volume=7|issue=2|pages=e00158-16|doi=10.1128/mBio.00158-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1966 most scientists in geology accepted the theory of plate tectonics.&lt;ref name="2009 encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frankel|first1=Henry|title=NEW OBJECTS AND IDEAS|date=2009|pages=383-394|doi=10.1017/CHOL9780521572019.021|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The root of this was [[Alfred Wegener]]'s 1912 publication of his theory of [[continental drift]], which was a controversy in the field through the 1950s.&lt;ref name="2009 encyclopedia"/&gt; At that point scientists introduced new evidence in a new way, replacing the idea of continental drift with instead a theory of plate tectonics.&lt;ref name="2009 encyclopedia"/&gt; The acceptance of this theory brought scientific and cultural change which commentators called the "Plate Tectonics Revolution".&lt;ref name="2009 encyclopedia"/&gt;

==Response==
In 1975 a paper said that "plate tectonics" gained general acceptance in its field in 1968 and called that acceptance a revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dietz|first1=Robert S.|title=Plate tectonics: A revolution in geology and geophysics|journal=Tectonophysics|date=March 1977|volume=38|issue=1-2|pages=1–6|doi=10.1016/0040-1951(77)90197-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One scientist said that the Plate Tectonics Revolution brought excitement among scientists in the field in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oliver|first1=Jack|title=Seismology, the plate tectonics revolution, and making it happen again|journal=Tectonophysics|date=February 1991|volume=187|issue=1-3|pages=37–49|doi=10.1016/0040-1951(91)90411-K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publications in generations after the event reflected on how the Plate Tectonics Revolution was an early example of [[data science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morford|first1=Stacy|title=The Plate Tectonics Revolution: It Was All About the Data|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2016/05/24/the-plate-tectonics-revolution-it-was-all-about-the-data/|website=State of the Planet|publisher=[[The Earth Institute]]|date=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One commentator claimed that the plate tectonics theory became popular and established a revolution in culture even before scientists could confirm some of the claims for which evidence was lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Le Pichon|first1=Xavier|title=The "revolution" of Plate Tectonics in earth sciences and the relationship between science, reason, and truth|journal=Euresis Journal|date=2013|volume=5|issue=summer|pages=109-124|url=www.euresisjournal.org/public/article/pdf/LePichon.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of [[Young Earth creationism]] challenge the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nevins|first1=Stuart E.|title=Continental Drift, Plate Tectonics, and the Bible|journal=Acts &amp; Facts|date=1976|volume=5|issue=2|url=http://www.icr.org/article/continental-drift-plate-tectonics-bible/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are claims that science in Russia was a significant contribution to the Plate Tectonics Revolution, but Western bias against Russia has blocked recognition of their contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khain|first1=Victor E.|last2=Ryabukhin|first2=Anatoly G.|title=Russian geology and the plate tectonics revolution|journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications|date=2002|volume=192|issue=1|pages=185–198|doi=10.1144/GSL.SP.2002.192.01.09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Positron emission''' or '''beta plus decay''' (β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decay) is a subtype of [[radioactive decay]] called [[beta decay]], in which a [[proton]] inside a [[radionuclide]] nucleus is converted into a [[neutron]] while releasing a [[positron]] and an [[electron neutrino]] (''ν''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|title=Nuclear Chemistry|url=http://www.shodor.org/unchem/advanced/nuc/|accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positron emission is mediated by the [[weak force]]. The positron is a type of [[beta particle]] (β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), the other beta particle being the electron (β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) emitted from the β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay of a nucleus.

An example of positron emission (β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decay) is shown with [[magnesium-23]] decaying into [[sodium-23]]:

:{{nuclide|Magnesium|23}} → {{nuclide|Sodium|23}} + {{subatomic particle|positron}} + {{subatomic particle|electron neutrino}}

Because positron emission decreases proton number relative to neutron number, positron decay happens typically in large "proton-rich" radionuclides. Positron decay results in [[nuclear transmutation]], changing an atom of one chemical element into an atom of an element with an [[atomic number]] that is less by one unit.

Positron emission should not be confused with [[Beta decay#β− decay|electron emission]] or beta minus decay (β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay), which occurs when a neutron turns into a proton and the nucleus emits an electron and an antineutrino.

Positron emission is different from [[proton decay]], the hypothetical decay of protons, not necessarily those bound with neutrons, not necessarily through the emission of a positron and not as part of nuclear physics, but rather of [[particle physics]].

==Discovery of positron emission==
In 1934 [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie|Frédéric]] and [[Irène Joliot-Curie]] bombarded aluminium with [[Alpha particle|alpha particles]] to effect the nuclear reaction {{nuclide|Helium|4}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{nuclide|Aluminium|27}}&amp;nbsp;→ {{nuclide|Phosphorus|30}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{nuclide|neutronium|1}}, and observed that the product isotope {{nuclide|Phosphorus|30}} emits a positron identical to those found in cosmic rays by [[Carl David Anderson]] in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;I. Curie and F. Joliot, ''C. R. Acad. Sci.'' 198, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k31506/f254.image 254] (1934)&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first example of {{SubatomicParticle|Beta+}}&amp;nbsp;decay (positron emission). The Curies termed the phenomenon "artificial radioactivity," since {{nuclide|Phosphorus|30}} is a short-lived nuclide which does not exist in nature. The discovery of artificial radioactivity would be cited when the husband and wife team won the Nobel Prize.

==Positron-emitting isotopes==
[[Isotope]]s which undergo this decay and thereby emit positrons include [[carbon-11]], [[potassium-40]], [[nitrogen-13]], [[Isotopes of oxygen|oxygen-15]], [[aluminium-26]], [[Isotopes of sodium|sodium-22]], [[fluorine-18]], and [[Isotopes of iodine|iodine-124]]. As an example, the following equation describes the beta plus decay of carbon-11 to [[boron]]-11, emitting a positron and a [[neutrino]]:

==Emission mechanism==
Inside protons and neutrons, there are [[fundamental particles]] called [[quark]]s. The two most common types of quarks are ''[[up quarks]]'', which have a charge of +&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''[[down quarks]]'', with a −&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; charge. Quarks arrange themselves in sets of three such that they make [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s. In a proton, whose charge is +1, there are two ''up'' quarks and one ''down'' quark (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; − &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 1). Neutrons, with no charge, have one ''up'' quark and two ''down'' quarks (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; − &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; − &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0). Via the [[weak interaction]], quarks can change [[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]] from ''down'' to ''up'', resulting in [[beta particle|electron]] emission. Positron emission happens when an ''up'' quark changes into a ''down'' quark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://courses.washington.edu/bioen508/Lecture5-B-PET.pdf How it works:Positron emission]&lt;/ref&gt; (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; − 1 = −&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

Nuclei which decay by positron emission may also decay by [[electron capture]]. For low-energy decays, electron capture is energetically favored by 2''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.022&amp;nbsp;MeV, since the final state has an electron removed rather than a positron added. As the energy of the decay goes up, so does the [[branching ratio]] towards positron emission. However, if the energy difference is less than 2''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then positron emission cannot occur and electron capture is the sole decay mode. Certain otherwise electron-capturing isotopes (for instance, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Beryllium|7}}) are stable in [[galactic cosmic rays]], because the electrons are stripped away and the decay energy is too small for positron emission.

==Energy conservation==
A positron is ejected from the parent nucleus, and the daughter (Z−1) atom must shed an orbital electron to balance charge. The overall results is that the mass of two electrons are ejected from the atom (one for the positron and one for the electron), and the β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decay is energetically possible only if the mass of the parent atom exceeds the mass of the daughter atom by at least two electron masses (1.02 MeV).

Isotopes which increase in mass under the conversion of a proton to a neutron, or which decrease in mass by less than 2''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, cannot spontaneously decay by positron emission.

==Application==
These isotopes are used in [[positron emission tomography]], a technique used for medical imaging. Note that the energy emitted depends on the isotope that is decaying; the figure of 0.96&amp;nbsp;MeV applies only to the decay of carbon-11.

The short-lived positron emitting isotopes &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;N, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;O and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F used for positron emission tomography are typically produced by proton irradiation of natural or enriched targets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pet.ubc.ca/radioisotopes Positron Emission Tomography Imaging at the University of British Columbia] (accessed 11 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://iopscience.iop.org/0022-3727/37/16/019/ | doi = 10.1088/0022-3727/37/16/019 | title = High power laser production of short-lived isotopes for positron emission tomography | year = 2004 | last1 = Ledingham | first1 = K W D | last2 = McKenna | first2 = P | last3 = McCanny | first3 = T | last4 = Shimizu | first4 = S | last5 = Yang | first5 = J M | last6 = Robson | first6 = L | last7 = Zweit | first7 = J | last8 = Gillies | first8 = J M | last9 = Bailey | first9 = J | last10 = Chimon | first10 = G N | last11 = Clarke | first11 = R J | last12 = Neely | first12 = D | last13 = Norreys | first13 = P A | last14 = Collier | first14 = J L | last15 = Singhal | first15 = R P | last16 = Wei | first16 = M S | last17 = Mangles | first17 = S P D | last18 = Nilson | first18 = P | last19 = Krushelnick | first19 = K | last20 = Zepf | first20 = M | journal = Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics | volume = 37 | issue = 16 | pages = 2341 |bibcode = 2004JPhD...37.2341L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rajmahal Traps''' is a volcanic igneous province in [[East India|Eastern India]], covering the parts of [[Jharkhand]], [[West Bengal]] and [[Meghalaya]]. [[Rajmahal hills]] of [[Jharkhand]] is the type area of this province. Multiple layers of solidified lava made {{convert|608|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick Rajmahal hill which is dipping 2°-5° towards north-east. Individual layers vary in thickness from less than 1 metre to more than 70 meters.&lt;ref name=Valdiya&gt;{{cite book|last=Valdiya|first=K. S.|title=The Making of India, Geodynamic Evolution|year=2010|publisher=Macmillan Publishers India Ltd.|isbn=978-0230-32833-4|pages=323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genesis==
These volcanic rocks were formed from the eruptions of the [[Kerguelen hotspot]] in the early [[Cretaceous]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Vincent Courtillot|Courtillot, Vincent]]. ''Evolutionary Catastrophes: The Science of Mass Extinctions.'' Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1999; p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The similarity between the geochemical data of Rajmahal volcanis and lavas of the [[Kerguelen Plateau]] confirms this. According to the [[plate tectonics]], the Indian subcontinent was over this hot spot during the [[Cretaceous]] age.

The original lava flow covered an area of nearly {{convert| 4100 |sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Below the Bengal basin the flows cover {{convert|200000|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="A P Singh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=A.

==Lithology==
The Rajmahal volcanics are predominantly [[tholeiitic basalt]], quartz tholeiite, olivine tholeiite and [[alkali basalt]]. The [[Intertrappean Beds]] are composed of [[sedimentary rock]] like [[siltstone]], [[claystone]] and [[shale]].&lt;ref name=Valdiya /&gt;

==Structural Evolution==
The western boundary of the Rajmahal Traps is faulted and down-thrown towards the east. The eastern boundary of this trap has a North-South trending, fault-controlled basement. This basement connects the Purnea basin of the Ganga valley with the Bengal basin. These faulted contacts, along with the Damodar Gondwana [[graben]], form a [[triple junction]] at the mouth of the Bengal basin. The trap evolved along the then eastern continental margin of India, following rifting of [[Gondwanaland]]. Over the epochs, the upper part of the lava deformed in a cold, brittle fashion and formed [[graben]] structures.&lt;ref name="A P Singh" /&gt;

==Fossils==
The [[Intertrappean Beds]] contain assamblage of lower [[cretaceous]] [[plant fossil]]. The assemblage includes ''Cladophlebis indica'', ''Dictyozamites indicus'', ''Taeniopteris spatulata'', ''Brachyphyllum rhombium''.

'''''Rasputitsa''''' ({{lang-rus|распу́тица|p=rɐsˈputʲɪtsə}}) is a [[Russian language]] term for two periods of the year (or "[[season]]s") when travel on [[Road surface|unpaved roads]] becomes difficult, owing to muddy conditions from rain or thawing snow. That is, it is applied to both [[spring (season)|spring]] and  [[autumn]]. The word "''rasputitsa''" is also used to refer to the condition of roads during both periods.&lt;ref name = Comrades&gt;{{cite book

==Effects==
===Civil===
The term is applied to muddy road conditions in [[Belarus]], [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]], which are caused by the poor drainage of underlying clay-laden soils found in the region. Roads are subject to weight limitations and closures during the period in certain districts of Russia. The phenomenon was a hindrance in the early 20th century in the [[Soviet Union]] since 40% of rural villages were not served by paved roads.&lt;ref name = Comrades/&gt;

===Wartime===
''Rasputitsa'' seasons of Russia are well known as a great defensive advantage in wartime.&lt;ref name="napoleon-series"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adolphe Thiers, 1864, p. 234"/&gt; Common nicknames are ''General Mud'' or ''Marshal Mud''. During the [[French invasion of Russia]] in 1812, [[Napoleon]] found the mud to be a great hindrance.&lt;ref name="napoleon-series"&gt;[http://www.napoleon-series.org/faq/c_russia.html FAQ regarding what made Napoleon fail in invading Russia], Napoleon -series website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adolphe Thiers, 1864, p. 234"&gt;{{Cite book |title=History of the Consulate and the Empire of France under Napoleon |author=M.

During the [[Second World War]], the month-long muddy period slowed down the [[Germany|German]] advance during the [[Battle of Moscow]] and may have helped save the Soviet capital from German occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Overy, Richard |author-link=Overy, Richard |date=1997 |title=Russia's War |location=London |publisher=Penguin |isbn=1-57500-051-2 |pages=113–114 |quote=Both sides now struggled in the autumn mud. On October 6 [1941] the first snow had fallen, unusually early. It soon melted, turning the whole landscape into its habitual trackless state – the ''rasputitsa'', literally the ‘time without roads’.... It is commonplace to attribute the German failure to take Moscow to the sudden change in the weather. While it is certainly true that German progress slowed, it had already been slowing because of the fanatical resistance of Soviet forces and the problem of moving supplies over the long distances through occupied territory. The mud slowed the Soviet build-up also, and hampered the rapid deployment of men and machines.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SINPO''', an [[acronym]] for S'''ignal, Interference, Noise, Propagation, and Overall''', is a Signal Reporting Code used to describe the quality of [[radiotelegraph]] transmissions. SINPFEMO, an acronym for S'''ignal, Interference, Noise, Propagation, frequency of Fading, Modulation, dEpth, and Overall''' is used to describe the quality of [[Radiotelephone|radiotelephony]] transmissions.  SINPFEMO code consists of the SINPO code plus the addition of three letters to describe additional features of radiotelephony transmissions. These codes are defined by ''Recommendation ITU-R Sm.1135, SINPO and SINPFEMO codes''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/sm/R-REC-SM.1135-0-199510-I!!PDF-E.pdf|title=ITU-R Sm.1135, SINPO and SINPFEMO codes|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SINPO code is most frequently used in [[reception report]]s written by [[shortwave listening|shortwave listeners]]. Each letter of the code stands for a specific factor of the signal, and each item is graded on a 1 to 5 scale (where 1 stands for nearly undetectable/severe/unusable and 5 for excellent/nil/extremely strong).

The code originated with the [[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] (a predecessor to the ITU-R) in 1951, and was widely used by BBC shortwave listeners to submit signal reports, with many going so far as to mail audio recordings to the BBC's offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Engineering Division Monnograph, Number 43: September 1962|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/archive/pdffiles/monographs/bbc_monograph_43.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SINPO and SINPFEMO are the official signal reporting codes for international civil aviation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Procedures for Air Navigation Services: ICAO Abbreviations and Codes|url=http://www.icao.int/NACC/Documents/Meetings/2014/ECARAIM/REF03-ICAOCodes.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ITU-R.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The use of the SINPO code can be subjective and may vary from person to person. Not all [[shortwave]] listeners are conversant with the SINPO code and prefer using plain language instead.

==SINPO code explained==

; S ([[Signalling (telecommunication)|Signal]] strength) : The relative strength of the transmission.
; I ([[Interference (communication)|Interference]]) : Interference from other stations on the same or adjacent frequencies (man-made noise).
; N ([[Signal noise|Noise]]) : The amount of atmospheric noise.
; P ([[Radio propagation|Propagation]]) : Whether the signal is steady or fades from time to time.
; O (Overall merit) : An overall score for the listening experience under these conditions.

Each category is rated from 1 to 5 with 1 being 'unusable' or 'severe' and 5 being 'perfect' or 'nil'. MANY raters misunderstand the code and will rate everything either 55555 or 11111 when in reality both extremes are unusual in the extreme.  '55555' essentially means 'perfect reception akin to a local station' while that is occasionally possible, when talking about long-distance short-wave reception, it is almost never the case.

Another common mistake in rating is presenting an 'O' higher than any previously rated element. By definition, a station cannot present 'perfect' reception if there is any Noise or Interference or Fading present. In other words, it is NOT 'perfect local quality' reception if any of those things are present.

==Examples of SINPO code applied==

In responding to a shortwave reception, the SINPO indicates to the transmitting station the overall quality of the reception.

The SINPO code in normal use consists of the 5 rating numbers listed without the letters, as in the examples below:

* '''54554''' – This indicates a relatively clear reception, with only slight interference; however, nothing that would significantly degrade the listening experience.
* '''33433''' – This indicates a signal which is moderately strong, but has more interference, and therefore deterioration of the received signal.

Generally, a SINPO with a code number starting with a 2 or lower would not be worth reporting, unless there is no noise, interference or loss of propagation, since it would be likely the signal would be unintelligible.

Although the original SINPO code established technical specifications for each number (i.e., a number 3 in the P column meant a fixed number of fades per minute), these are rarely adhered to by reporters.  The 'S' meter displays the relative strength of the received RF signal in decibels; however, this should not be used as the sole indication of signal strength, as no two S meters are calibrated exactly alike, and many lower-priced receivers omit the S meter altogether. References to a "SINFO" code may also be found in some literature. In this case, the 'F' stands for Fading, instead of 'P' for Propagation, but the two codes are interchangeable. It was presumed that the average listener would be more familiar with the meaning of "fading" than "propagation". A simple way to ensure the rating applied is useful is to rate the "O" column first based on the intelligibility of the station. If you can understand everything easily, the station will rate a 4 or higher. If you have to work hard, but can understand everything '3' is the appropriate rating. If you cannot understand everything although you put great effort into it, a '2' is appropriate, and if you cannot understand the programming at all '1' is the appropriate rating.

Some listeners may not know how to distinguish between the 'I' which indicates interference from adjacent stations, and the 'N' which describes natural atmospheric or man-made noise; also for some listeners, the rating for 'Propagation' may not be completely understood. As a result of this confusion, many stations suggest the SIO code&amp;nbsp;– a simpler code which makes the limitations noted above not relevant. Despite this, some books and periodicals maintain the SINPO code is the best for DX reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reception Reports: Reporting Code - Writing Useful Reception Reports |url=http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-reception-reports-codes.html |accessdate=27 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107033211/http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-reception-reports-codes.html |archivedate=January 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9604">'''Superfluidity''' is the characteristic property of a [[fluid]] with zero [[viscosity]] which therefore flows without loss of [[kinetic energy]]. When stirred, a superfluid forms cellular [[vortex|vortices]] that continue to rotate indefinitely. Superfluidity occurs in two [[isotope]]s of [[helium]] ([[helium-3]] and [[helium-4]]) when they are liquified by cooling to [[cryogenic]] temperatures. It is also a property of various other exotic states of matter theorized to exist in [[astrophysics]], [[high-energy physics]], and theories of [[quantum gravity]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1996/advanced.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1996 - Advanced Information|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon is related to [[Bose–Einstein condensate|Bose–Einstein condensation]], but neither is a specific type of the other: not all Bose-Einstein condensates can be regarded as superfluids, and not all superfluids are Bose–Einstein condensates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/superfluid-can-climb-walls/|title=Strange but True: Superfluid Helium Can Climb Walls|last=Minkel|first=JR|newspaper=[[Scientific American]]|access-date=2017-02-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of superfluidity was developed by [[Lev Landau]].

== Superfluidity of liquid helium ==
{{Main|Superfluid helium-4}}
Superfluidity was originally discovered in [[liquid helium]], by [[Pyotr Kapitsa]] and [[John F. Allen]]. It has since been described through phenomenology and microscopic theories. In liquid [[helium-4]], the superfluidity occurs at far higher temperatures than it does in [[helium-3]]. Each atom of helium-4 is a [[boson]] particle, by virtue of its [[integer spin]]. A helium-3 atom is a [[fermion]] particle; it can form bosons only by pairing with itself at much lower temperatures. The discovery of superfluidity in helium-3 was the basis for the award of the 1996 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This process is similar to the [[electron pair]]ing in [[superconductivity]].

== Ultracold atomic gases ==
Superfluidity in an ultracold fermionic gas was experimentally proven by [[Wolfgang Ketterle]] and his team who observed [[quantum vortex|quantum vortices]] in [[Lithium-6|&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Li]] at a temperature of 50 nK at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in April 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2005/matter.html| title = MIT physicists create new form of matter| accessdate = November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Grimm | first1 = R. | title = Low-temperature physics: A quantum revolution | doi = 10.1038/4351035a | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = 7045 | pages = 1035–1036 | year = 2005 | pmid =  15973388| pmc = |bibcode = 2005Natur.435.1035G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such vortices had previously been observed in an ultracold bosonic gas using [[Rubidium-87|&lt;sup&gt;87&lt;/sup&gt;Rb]] in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Madison | first1 = K. | last2 = Chevy | first2 = F. | last3 = Wohlleben | first3 = W. | last4 = Dalibard | first4 = J. | title = Vortex Formation in a Stirred Bose-Einstein Condensate | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.806 | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 84 | issue = 5 | pages = 806–809 | year = 2000 | pmid =  11017378| pmc = |arxiv = cond-mat/9912015 |bibcode = 2000PhRvL..84..806M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently in [[two-dimensional gas]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Burnett | first1 = K. | title = Atomic physics: Cold gases venture into Flatland | doi = 10.1038/nphys704 | journal = Nature Physics | volume = 3 | issue = 9 | pages = 589 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2007NatPh...3..589B }}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1999 [[Lene Hau]] created such a condensate using sodium atoms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hau | first1 = L.

== Superfluid in astrophysics ==
The idea that superfluidity exists inside [[neutron star]]s was first proposed by
[[Arkady Migdal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=A. B. Migdal|journal= Nucl.

Cooper pairs due to the long-range attractive nuclear force and lead to superfluidity
and superconductivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=U. Lombardo|author2=H.-J.

== Superfluidity in high-energy physics and quantum gravity ==
{{Main|Superfluid vacuum theory}}
[[Superfluid vacuum theory]] (SVT) is an approach in [[theoretical physics]] and [[quantum mechanics]] where the physical [[vacuum]] is viewed as superfluid.

The ultimate goal of the approach is to develop scientific models that unify quantum mechanics (describing three of the four known fundamental interactions) with [[gravity]]. This makes SVT a candidate for the theory of [[quantum gravity]] and an extension of the [[Standard Model]].

It is hoped that development of such theory would unify into a single consistent model of all fundamental interactions,
and to describe all known interactions and elementary particles as different manifestations of the same entity, superfluid vacuum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9483">An '''''urstromtal''''' (plural: ''Urstromtäler'') is a type of broad glacial [[valley]], for example, in northern [[Central Europe]], that appeared during the [[ice age]]s, or individual [[glacial period]]s of an ice age, at the edge of the Scandinavian [[ice sheet]] and was formed by meltwaters that flowed more or less parallel to the ice margin. ''Urstromtäler'' are an element of the [[glacial series]]. The term is German and means "ancient stream valley". Although often translated as "glacial valley", it should not be confused with a valley carved out by a glacier. More accurately some sources call them "meltwater valleys"&lt;ref&gt;Böse, Margot (2005). ''The Last Glaciation and Geomorphology'' in: Koster, E. (ed.): ''The Physical Geography of Western Europe'', Oxford University Press, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/umwelt/umweltatlas/ed101_07.htm ''Selected Soil Associations''], Berlin Digital Environmental Atlas, accessed on 23 Dec 2011&lt;/ref&gt; or "ice-marginal valleys".&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Ehlers, Philip Leonard Gibbard (ed.) (2004). ''Quaternary glaciations: extent and chronology, Part 3'', Elsevier, London, Oxford, San Diego, Amsterdam. p. 139. {{ISBN|0-444-51462-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergence and structure ==
[[File:SchnittUTal.jpg|thumb|Section through an ''Urstromtal'']]
Important for the emergence of the ''Urstromtäler'' is the fact that the general lie of the land on the [[North German Plain]] and in [[Poland]] slopes down from south to north. Thus the ice sheet that advanced from Scandinavia flowed into a rising terrain. The meltwaters could therefore only flow for a short distance southwards over the [[Outwash plain|sandurs]] (outwash plains) before having to find a way to the [[North Sea]] basin that was parallel to the ice margin. At that time, the area that is now the North Sea was dry as a result of the low level of the sea.

As elements of the glacial series, ''Urstromtäler'' are intermeshed with sandur areas for long stretches along their northern perimeters. It was over these outwash plains that the meltwaters poured into them. ''Urstromtäler'' are relatively uniformly composed of [[sand]]s and [[gravel]]s; the grain size can vary considerably, however. Fine sand dominates especially in the upper sections of the ''Urstromtal'' sediments. The thickness of the ''Urstromtal'' sediments also varies a great deal, but is mostly well over ten metres.

''Urstromtäler'' have a wide and very flat valley bottom that is between 1.5 and 20&amp;nbsp;kilometres wide. The valley sides, by contrast are only a few to a few dozen metres high. The bottom and the edges of an ''Urstromtal'' may have been significantly altered by younger processes, especially the thawing of [[dead ice]] blocks or the accumulation of [[sand dune]]s. In the [[Holocene|post-glacial period]], many ''Urstromtäler'' became bogs due to their low lying situation and the high water table.

== ''Urstromtäler'' in Central Europe ==
[[File:Urstromtaeler.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Weichselian ''Urstromtäler'' in Brandenburg]]
In Central Europe there are several ''Urstromtäler'' from various periods.
* Breslau-Magdeburg-Bremen ''Urstromtal''; ([[Poland]], [[Germany]]); formed during the [[Saale glaciation]]
* Glogau-Baruth ''Urstromtal''; (Poland, Germany); formed during the [[Weichselian]]
* Warsaw-Berlin ''Urstromtal''; (Poland, Germany); formed during the Weichselian
* Thorn-Eberswalde ''Urstromtal''; (Poland, Germany); formed during the Weichselian
* The term [[Elbe Urstromtal|Elbe ''Urstromtal'']] refers to the [[Elbe|Elbe valley]] roughly at the height of [[Genthin]] to the Elbe estuary at [[Cuxhaven]]. The meltwaters of the three above-mentioned Weichselian ''Urstromtäler'' flowed successively through this valley towards the North Sea basin.
* The term Rhine ''Urstromtal'' for the [[Rhine]] valley from [[Düsseldorf]] to its mouth on the North Sea is disputed. The Rhine was certainly a route for meltwaters during the Saale glaciation. The structure of the valley is however clearly older and was formed by recent [[tectonics]].
* In the [[Alps|Alpine]] glaciation zone of Central Europe the term ''Urstromtal'' is not used. In this region, the [[Danube]] and, periodically, the [[Rhine]] carried the meltwaters away.

Some sections of the aforementioned main valleys have been given their own names. The Lusatian ''Urstromtal'' and the Aller ''Urstromtal'' are parts of the Breslau-Magdeburg-Bremen ''Urstromtal''. The Baruth, Berlin and Eberswalde ''Urstromtäler'' are common short names for the associated sections of the ''Urstromtal'' in [[Brandenburg]].

In addition to the large main valleys there are also numerous smaller meltwater valleys (''Urstromtalungen''). Their appearances is similar to that of the great ''Urstromtäler'', but they are considerably shorter. They are also not linked to a sandur and a [[terminal moraine]].

Urstromtals of Central Europe (Poland, Germany and Denmark especially) were directly connected to the North Atlantic Ocean, via the [[Channel River]], during Pleistocene maximum glaciations, i.e. at time of confluence of the British and Fennoscandian ice-sheets in the intervening North Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toucanne | first1 = S. | last2 = Zaragosi | first2 = S. | last3 = Bourillet | first3 = J.F. | last4 = Cremer | first4 = M. | last5 = Eynaud | first5 = F. | last6 = Van Vliet-Lanöe | first6 = B. | last7 = Penaud | first7 = A. | last8 = Fontanier | first8 = C. | last9 = Turon | first9 = J.L. | last10 = Cortijo | first10 = E. | last11 = Gibbard | first11 = P.L. | year = 2009 | title = Timing of massive 'Fleuve Manche' discharges over the last 350 kyr: Insights into the European ice sheet oscillations and the European drainage network from MIS 10 to 2 | doi = 10.1016/j.quascirev.2009.01.006 | journal = Quaternary Science Reviews | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 1238–1256 | bibcode = 2009QSRv...28.1238T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toucanne | first1 = S. | last2 = Zaragosi | first2 = S. | last3 = Bourillet | first3 = J.F. | last4 = Marieu | first4 = M. | last5 = Cremer | first5 = M. | last6 = Kageyama | first6 = M. | last7 = Van Vliet-Lanöe | first7 = B. | last8 = Eynaud | first8 = F. | last9 = Turon | first9 = J.L. | last10 = Gibbard | first10 = P.L. | year = 2010 | title = The first estimation of Fleuve Manche palaeoriver discharge during the last deglaciation: Evidence for Fennoscandian ice sheet meltwater flow in the English Channel ca 20-18 ka ago | doi = 10.1016/j.epsl.2009.12.050 | journal = Earth and Planetary Science Letters | volume = 290 | issue = | pages = 459–473 | bibcode=2010E&amp;PSL.290..459T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
''Urstromtäler'' should not be confused with [[tunnel valley]]s. The latter are formed beneath, not in front of, the ice mass. In addition most tunnel valleys run from north to south. The principal direction of ''Urstromtäler'' is from east to west. Today ''Urstromtäler'' are only partly used by rivers, because the majority have found shorter routes to the sea (like the [[Oder]] and [[Vistula]]). The straight troughs of the ''Urstromtäler'' between the rivers were used for canal routes due to their low gradient, for example for the [[Elbe–Havel Canal]] or the [[Oder–Havel Canal]].

Because the land in [[North America]] and on the [[Russian Plain]] tilts towards the south, the formation of ''Urstromtäler'' there during the ice age did not take place. The [[Mississippi River]] and its tributaries carried the meltwaters of the North American ice sheet away. In Eastern Europe the meltwaters flowed down the river basins of the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]], [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and [[Volga]].

''Urstromtäler'', whether sandy or boggy, posed considerable obstacles to movement in the [[Middle Ages]]. As a result, the [[trade routes]] converged on points where the valley could be crossed comparatively easily. These hubs thus became favourite sites for the founding of towns or castles. Examples from the German state of Brandenburg include [[Berlin]], [[Fürstenwalde/Spree|Fürstenwalde]], [[Luckenwalde]] and [[Baruth/Mark]], and from Lower Saxony the town of  [[Vorsfelde#Siedlungslage|Vorsfelde]] and [[Wolfsburg Castle]].
